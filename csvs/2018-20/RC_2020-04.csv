[],,bbynug,1524515156.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_10irg672,False,False,[],"98% of all residents in Massachusetts are insured. MA has a single payer system that is subsidized for low income folks. Below a certain income you will pay $0 for insurance, prescriptions are a few bucks and you certainly will not pay for an ambulance. Full dental and vision coverage as well. There is substantial coverage for things like mental healthcare for those under 18. MA was the first state to implement a single payer insurance system and its model is what the ACA (Obamacare) and other state systems are based on. Is it perfect? No. But it’s approaching as close to perfect as is possible under the insurance system.  Private hospitals are exceptional in Massachusetts, among the best in the world. And the cost? Well, if you’re insured...which nearly the entire state is...the cost is very affordable.

As for free public schools, that’s K-12 in the US, again, [Massachusetts](http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=24050).  This is the yearly, international [PISA assessment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment). The only country to outperform this state in science scores was Singapore. In Math, the European countries MA was outperformed by were Estonia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. No Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Germany to be found on this list I’m afraid...So weird, right? And in Reading? Massachusetts had the highest test scores *in the world* outperforming not only Finland but Singapore, Japan, Korea and...everyone else. So there you go, there’s a state. Granted, this was from 2016 so perhaps the rankings have fluctuated a bit. 

As for universities, I think you’re aware of some of the universities that exist in Massachusetts so I won’t get into that. Beyond just those school, there are really too many top-ranking universities in the US to list but a Google search should help you out. Are they free? No, definitely not. And that’s certainly a problem that there’s no excuse for. I do know that at Ivy League school, students below a certain income level will get a completely free ride and they have dedicated admission spots for low-income and community college transfer students so there’s that. But I won’t argue that affordable higher education isn’t an issue. 

I am not trying to argue that the US does not have problems. Nor am I going to pretend that one state is representative of the entire country (but you *did* ask for one state so). It isn’t. I won’t argue that European countries, as a whole, are superior in a number of ways. 

But I’m also sick of people on Reddit who have clearly never set foot in the US claiming that it is “literally a third world country” and “a complete shithole” full of uneducated, gun-toting lunatics who worship Trump and who will be tossed out of hospitals and left to die in the streets if they don’t have insurance. 

I’m sick of the glee that people from other countries seem to take in pointing out the problems we have in the US, as if it’s enjoyable to gloat about  having “free” healthcare, as if we don’t already know that and aren’t aware that we don’t have it, as if they’re doing us a great service by pointing it out. Would it be hilarious to constantly point out the [alcoholism death rate](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alcohol/by-country/) in European utopias like Denmark? Or that 47% of Australians are [functionally illiterate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/illiteracy-rates-australias-national-shame)? Germanys atrocious [infrastructure](https://www.theglobalist.com/germany-angela-merkel-government-spending/)? Id the US is truly a third world nation, as so many claim, isn’t it kind of in poor taste to take pleasure in making fun of the problems in developing country? 

I suspect this behavior some sort of “payback” for those Americans who participate in unbridled patriotism.

Dacă nu ți-ai găsit oamenii care să te înțeleagă și accepte, asta nu înseamnă că ei nu există sau că cei care sunt acum în viața ta au dreptate.

Ce încerc să spun este că nu trebuie să lași oamenii din jur să determine cine ești tu. Dacă ești împăcat cu tine și încerci să fii o persoană cât mai bună, lucrurile bune își vor găsi drumul către tine. Important este, cum spuneam din start, să nu stai supărat, cu mâinile în sân.

Ăsta e primul pas: propune-ți un proiect - care să dureze măcar vreo două săptămâni, să zicem - și vezi cum merge. Dacă ești absolut sigur că nu te atrage, caută altceva. Dacă nu, termină proiectul, cere niște feedback eventual și caută apoi ceva mai complicat de făcut.

&gt; Dear Chancellor,

&gt; As Emeritus of the Johannes-Gutenberg-University in Mainz and longtime director of the Institute for Medical Microbiology, I feel obliged to critically question the far-reaching restrictions on public life that we are currently taking on ourselves in order to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

&gt; It is expressly not my intention to play down the dangers of the virus or to spread a political message. However, I feel it is my duty to make a scientific contribution to putting the current data and facts into perspective – and, in addition, to ask questions that are in danger of being lost in the heated debate.

&gt; The reason for my concern lies above all in the truly unforeseeable socio-economic consequences of the drastic containment measures which are currently being applied in large parts of Europe and which are also already being practiced on a large scale in Germany.

&gt; My wish is to discuss critically – and with the necessary foresight – the advantages and disadvantages of restricting public life and the resulting long-term effects.

&gt; To this end, I am confronted with five questions which have not been answered sufficiently so far, but which are indispensable for a balanced analysis.

&gt; I would like to ask you to comment quickly and, at the same time, appeal to the Federal Government to develop strategies that effectively protect risk groups without restricting public life across the board and sow the seeds for an even more intensive polarization of society than is already taking place.

&gt; With the utmost respect,

&gt; Prof. em. Dr. med. Sucharit Bhakdi

&gt; 1. Statistics
&gt; In infectiology – founded by Robert Koch himself – a traditional distinction is made between infection and disease. An illness requires a clinical manifestation. Therefore, only patients with symptoms such as fever or cough should be included in the statistics as new cases.

&gt; In other words, a new infection – as measured by the COVID-19 test – does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with a newly ill patient who needs a hospital bed. However, it is currently assumed that five percent of all infected people become seriously ill and require ventilation. Projections based on this estimate suggest that the healthcare system could be overburdened.

&gt; My question: Did the projections make a distinction between symptom-free infected people and actual, sick patients – i.e. people who develop symptoms?

&gt; 2. Dangerousness
A number of coronaviruses have been circulating for a long time – largely unnoticed by the media. If it should turn out that the COVID-19 virus should not be ascribed a significantly higher risk potential than the already circulating corona viruses, all countermeasures would obviously become unnecessary.

&gt; The internationally recognized International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents will soon publish a paper that addresses exactly this question. Preliminary results of the study can already be seen today and lead to the conclusion that the new virus is NOT different from traditional corona viruses in terms of dangerousness. The authors express this in the title of their paper „SARS-CoV-2: Fear versus Data“. 

&gt; My question: How does the current workload of intensive care units with patients with diagnosed COVID-19 compare to other coronavirus infections, and to what extent will this data be taken into account in further decision-making by the federal government? In addition: Has the above study been taken into account in the planning so far?  Here too, of course, „diagnosed“ means that the virus plays a decisive role in the patient’s state of illness, and not that previous illnesses play a greater role.

&gt; 3. Dissemination
According to a report in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, not even the much-cited Robert Koch Institute knows exactly how much is tested for COVID-19. It is a fact, however, that a rapid increase in the number of cases has recently been observed in Germany as the volume of tests increases. 

&gt; It is therefore reasonable to suspect that the virus has already spread unnoticed in the healthy population. This would have two consequences: firstly, it would mean that the official death rate – on 26 March 2020, for example, there were 206 deaths from around 37,300 infections, or 0.55 percent – is too high; and secondly, it would mean that it would hardly be possible to prevent the virus from spreading in the healthy population.

&gt; My question: Has there already been a random sample of the healthy general population to validate the real spread of the virus, or is this planned in the near future?

&gt; 4. Mortality
The fear of a rise in the death rate in Germany (currently 0.55 percent) is currently the subject of particularly intense media attention. Many people are worried that it could shoot up like in Italy (10 percent) and Spain (7 percent) if action is not taken in time.

&gt; At the same time, the mistake is being made worldwide to report virus-related deaths as soon as it is established that the virus was present at the time of death – regardless of other factors. This violates a basic principle of infectiology: only when it is certain that an agent has played a significant role in the disease or death may a diagnosis be made. The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies of Germany expressly writes in its guidelines: „In addition to the cause of death, a causal chain must be stated, with the corresponding underlying disease in third place on the death certificate. Occasionally, four-linked causal chains must also be stated.“ 

&gt; At present there is no official information on whether, at least in retrospect, more critical analyses of medical records have been undertaken to determine how many deaths were actually caused by the virus.

&gt; My question: Has Germany simply followed this trend of a COVID-19 general suspicion? And: is it intended to continue this categorisation uncritically as in other countries? How, then, is a distinction to be made between genuine corona-related deaths and accidental virus presence at the time of death?

&gt; 5. Comparability
The appalling situation in Italy is repeatedly used as a reference scenario. However, the true role of the virus in that country is completely unclear for many reasons – not only because points 3 and 4 above also apply here, but also because exceptional external factors exist which make these regions particularly vulnerable.

&gt; One of these factors is the increased air pollution in the north of Italy. According to WHO estimates, this situation, even without the virus, led to over 8,000 additional deaths per year in 2006 in the 13 largest cities in Italy alone. The situation has not changed significantly since then. Finally, it has also been shown that air pollution greatly increases the risk of viral lung diseases in very young and elderly people.

Germany has more ICU beds per capita than any other European country at nearly 5 times the UK per 100,000. 

Also, if you look at a graph of NHS funding increases/decreases, the increases all coincide with years with labour in power (admittedly bar ‘new Labour’ which was just lite Toryism), and the decreases all coincide with years the Tories were in power. It’s not a coincidence. 

Conservatives make these same arguments over and over in all western countries, that funding education and healthcare won’t work, it has nothing to do with parties, both sides yadda yadda while conveniently ignoring or downplaying the success of scandanavia and Germany at implementing these practices.

It was a braindead response to modern and contemporary architecture and how it's destroying European building aesthetics. 

For a group of people who claim to not want to consume for fear of becoming slaves to the producer's ideologies they seem to have done the same to themselves just by inundating themselves with ""traditional"" (read: fascist) rhetoric. It's an absolutely brainless approach to beauty, aesthetics, and values. 

Many of the cathedrals, museums, and other buildings they worship were inspired by principles of mathematics and sciences that were available at the time. That has not changed. The source of inspiration is actually the same, but the complexities and development of the fields architects (and other designers/artists) draw on have in turn created development in the craft.

I think fascists should utilise striking and stuff until we get power but then obviously the state will be a people's state with all the classes integrated and working together. Private ownership will be retained but all industry will be organised, many forms of non-productive economic activity will be banned or limited to the state IE usury and speculation.

2) Any state that isn't increasing its power is by default decreasing its power because other states are going to be increasing their power. Isolationism, limiting your population etc are only going to leave you open to being conquered by other states. I am personally very eco-fascist but I can't get on board with anti-natalism even though I am against global overpopulation. In our friend-enemy distinction it's not the Europeans that are the problem. We are the only race that is environmentally conscious and we're the race with the smallest number. Indians, Africans and Asians all outnumber us, each of them about 2:1.

3) Nah the best solution is to make it impossible for them to hold office, own property, work in societal and cultural institutions etc in the country. Offer them repatriation sums to go to Israel where they belong.

The guy was the typical oversocialised shitlib who thinks he's a communist. Most 'Marxist-Leninist'/MLs are actually OLs, Oversocialised-Libertines. Credit to him for at least letting CT speak, CT definitely should have pointed out the humiliation, genocides, atrocities etc committed by communists though. But not in the 'hur dur commies bad too' way but just as a way of neutralising the childish 'a fascist did a bad thing ergo fascism bad' nonsense. Yeah the Germans made Jews work in concentration camps but the Jews created 'reeducation' prisons where they forced Romanian prisoners to eat human shit in a mockery of the Orthodox church procession where they eat the bread or whatever. Let's quit with the moralising bullshit and talk about how we're going to get international finance out of power, the 'left' never wants to have that conversation though because they're not actual dissidents.

&gt;Anyway there should definitely be more fascist vs communist debates IMO.

I'd like to see real marxists, especially the anti-idpol ones, talk to fascists. Richard Spencer and Eric Striker talking to Jason Unruhe was pretty good as an example.

The big problem with the UK healthcare system, at a really high level, is similar to the problems that Obamacare has and is facing. Right wingers are trying to hollow it out and reduce funding constantly. While M4A is not immune to this, the elimination of private healthcare would certainly reduce the massive level of healthcare lobbyists fighting against *any* move leftward in terms of healthcare.

I also do not understand the strategic argument at all for multi-step plans to enact M4A through a public option phase. You're changing the system completely at least twice, with at least two major legislative battles which will probably occur under different presidents. All while Republican and even some neoliberals will be desperate to undermine the system the whole time. Realistically you are waiting 12-24 years for even a chance to fight for M4A if we keep compromising at this rate. On top of all of this, if you make the starting point of the argument public option then you absolutely are still going to have to compromise rightward. At that point, it's not even a newsworthy legislative move IMO. 

If Bernie or other progressives in Congress start extremely strong on M4A and then get negotiated down to a generous public option or some other form of single payer then that's awesome.

[],,iowaboy,1243723352.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3hwpo,False,True,[],"Well, there is a big “if.”

First, you keep saying that rich people work more efficiently than poor people, but you haven’t provided any explanation or evidence of this (all your statistics as the about time spent working, not production).

Second, you don’t explain what counts as “work.” I’m a lawyer, so I work on the bus ride into the office, I “work” by attending lunches to hear speeches, I count time at the office as “work” even when it is talking to my coworkers about TV shows. I also know people who fudge their bills, saying they spent .8 hours on something that took them .2 hours. Compare that to a guy working at Subway or Wal-Mart who can only count the time he is clocked in. I would say that, on average, our “work” is about the same. I may work more on weekends/nights, but I also get paid a lot more.

Third, you are only counting paid labor. Because I make a butt-load of money, I pay for dry-cleaning, I pay a bunch for a gym next door to my office, I buy lunch instead of prepping, I have a cleaner come in each month, and I pay a bunch for a downtown apartment so my commute is shorter. My brother, who is a high school teacher, spends 2 hours on the weekend prepping lunch, has to go to the YMCA that’s out of his way, doesn’t have a cleaner, has a 30 minute commute each way, and doesn’t often get to just grab take-out after a long day. He probably works as much as I do, he just doesn’t get paid for a lot of it.

Fourth, I can work more because my time is more flexible. Shift workers have to be at their job at set times, and they have to get special permission to do other things. For example, I’m planning a wedding. If I need to talk to a caterer or visit a jeweler to see a ring, I don’t have to “take time off work.” I just leave. Same thing in case of emergencies (like my car breaking down or needing to go to a relative’s parole hearing or a doctor’s appointment). Someone at Target would have to take time off work for that, and lose 2-8 hours of work.

Fifth, my earning potential (and that of most wealthy people) is based largely on my “soft skills,” and not as much on how hard or efficiently I work. For example, as a young lawyer, I got a lot of my opportunities through luck or privilege. Like, I was asked to second-chair a trial because the client was sexist and said he didn’t want a woman associate working on his case and he liked me because I went to a football game with him (paid for by the firm). Because of that, I got valuable trial experience and a fat bonus while my female coworker (who was 3 years ahead of me and a much better lawyer) didn’t.

Sixth, the multiple income thing is BS. I have three streams of income: my job, my investment portfolio, and a side-gig selling wine to friends (I shop in crates from Europe, keep a few bottles myself, and mark up the rest). I can only do this because I have a lot of expendable cash and rich friends. It’s not fair to tell a guy working three part-time jobs that he should have passive income, when he barely gets paid enough to make rent and basics.

Lastly, and this is not related to earning potential, this stuff about “spending less time on the internet and watching TV” is absolute crap. Yeah, I probably watch less TV than a lot of poor people, but that’s because I spend my free time going to the theater, eating at nice restaurants, going to galas (which my firm pays for), or working late so I can go on a 2-week trip to Paris or Rome or a safari or India or a cruise or Mexico (all of which I did in the past 2.5 years). If I made $40,000/year and couldn’t afford to randomly spend $50 on a whim, I would definitely be spending more time on the TV or internet.

The point is that, yeah, a lot of relatively rich people work hard. But that’s not the secret to their success. The secret is a mix of luck, connections, privileged upbringing, along with intelligence and hard work. The last two are also not that important if you’re rich enough (I once worked at family foundation run by a dumbass who couldn’t get a real job, so his dad put him in charge of the foundation and paid him $150,000 to give away money). It is cruel to tell poor people that they are poor because of some moral failure or Oman’s work ethic. Sure, encourage poor people, and give them a leg-up if you can, but it’s patronizing to say “you just don’t work hard enough.” Like, if I’ve had paralegals and legal assistants who are smarter than me and work harder, but will never make 50% of my starting salary because they had to work to support their family instead of going to college. If I ever heard another lawyer belittling them for not working hard enough or being dumb, I would go straight to the managing partner and demand that lawyer be fired.",True,False,False,,,0,1585705014,,False,0,{},fm2tf77,False,t3_fsgz5l,False,True,t1_fm1tsas,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/fsgz5l/the_rich_work_harder_really/fm2tf77/,False,,1592791031,0,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,r/CapitalismVSocialism,public,,0,[],

Ideologia politica e fix cauza esecului gestionarii crizei cu corona. Nu ma mira haosul gestionarii acestei crize, cand toata lumea e interesata de profit. Acum 2 saptamani, Trump era interesat sa fie unemployment minim in SUA ca sa castige alegerile. Acum o luna, Orban era interesat sa faca alegeri anticipate ca are mult in sondaje.

Acum 2 luni, se dadeau SUME IMENSE salarii bancherilor din risk management de pe wall street si city si etc, ca sa faca analize complet inutile (Absolut complet), le-a stricat corona toata analiza, efectiv au primit bani degeaba, ca sa poata dupa sa mearga in vacanta in Alpi si  croaziere si sa raspandeasca corona prin lume.

Mai mult, toata preocuparea economiei din ultimii 10 ani a fost growth at all costs. Expandarea excesiva a industriei de travel, reclame, IT asociat cu reclame, trading, etc. La research long-term si not-for-profit mai putin, ca deh, de acolo nu vin vacante de lux. Sau la investitii in spitale la fel, mai putin. In SUA profiturile merg la expertii in sanatate privata, doar nu vroiai sa testeze pe bune de la inceput, le pica profitul. (iar trump a avut interesele lui personale, asa cum am mai zis).

Normal ca nu ai spitale pregatite pentru o epidemie generala cand sanatatea globala in capitalism e focusata pe tratarea preferentiala a bogatilor si lasarea in urma a saracilor, pentru a stoarce un profit cat mai mare, nu pentru a stoarce cat mai multe boli. Partea proasta e ca virusului nu ii pasa de contul bancar.

Nu ti se pare interesant ca tarile cele mai pregatite in lupta cu corona au fost Germania, Norvegia, Japonia, Coreea de Sud, Islanda? Adica fix tari care au sisteme sanitare cel mai bine finantate via taxe. Japonia anul trecut a avut GDP growth negativ ca sa creasca taxa pe consum.

Norvegia a testat 90.000 oameni pana azi. SUA, cu o populatie de 60 ori mai mare, a testat vreo 800k :))). (nu mai zic cum arata situatia acum 10 zile, ca era dezastruos, in conditiile in care tara colcaia de corona).

Dar e ok, SUA cuantifica competitia foarte bine, e un sistem meritocratic! Nu avem alternativa!!!!!! E cea mai buna solutie existenta! :)))

Cercetarea si achizitionarea de materiale in vest ar fi putut porni extrem de in forta inca din ianuarie, in loc sa inceapa in forta in martie, daca prioritatile ar fi fost binele comun si apararea binelui comun, in loc sa fie ''hai sa mergem la Zermatt, Aosta, Verbier, Ischgl, Solden etc etc etc in vacanta sa ne aratam statusul si sa punem poze pe Instagram"" sau cine stie ce activitati pe wall st unde s-au facut bani din nimic  (inca se fac bani din nimic si acum, iti confirm eu ca m-am jucat un pic cu cursul la monede care au fluctuat tare pe revolut :))))  )

Gandeste-te numai cate tranzactii de arme s-au facut in ianuarie si februarie. Noi aveam nevoie de arme pentru razboaie facute pentru certuri inutile intre niste natiuni istorice pt orgolii si profituri ale unor anumite regiuni, nu aveam nevoie de fabrici noi de masti de corona. E foarte bine ca am dat 2% din PIB la armata (SUA chiar 4%) in ianuarie-februarie! Extrem de util pentru spitale! 

Concluzia, daca ai citit tot: Eu sunt socialist. (si sa stii ca gresesti; si tie ti-as recomanda sa lasi ideologiile politice)

Faptul ca spun ce e rau in capitalism nu inseamna ca e socialism. Daca ti se pare ca e socialism, inseamna ca pur si simplu esti tu pollarizat de o parte si ignori problemele partii aleia pentru ca stii ca orgoliul tau e direct conectat cu acea parte. :)))

Husband's co-worker and family have all been diagnosed after traveling to Europe for Spring Break (at a point when they probably should have known better). Another, older co-worker has it, evidently from community transmission. I haven't heard about anyone from my organization being diagnosed, but it's such a huge place, it's inevitable. They issued a policy that we're not supposed to tell anyone except admin if we or someone we know gets it.

My relative is a physician in NYC. She had traveled to Africa to do medical service work just before things went south, and had to return early. Since she had a layover in Europe, she had to self-quarantine when she got back. The hospital has her scheduled for basically the second she can return and every second thereafter. 

I know it's her job and they need her, but I'm freaking out, and I usually don't freak out. Neither does she, but she's pretty somber about all of this, and actually got onto me about not using public transit, going downtown, or even going to stores if I can help it. I have a heart condition (feels weird to say but it's true) and I'm not sure if it makes me more susceptible to serious complications, but I'd rather not find out the hard way.

I don't mind staying home, and my job is pretty secure and easy to do remotely, so I can't complain.

Italy is an ideal outpost for China’s wide-reaching propaganda effort to cover up its own responsibility for the global spread of the new coronavirus, all the while presenting itself as a compassionate power aiding Western countries in need.

The government has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy that carefully combines sending medical supplies to assert its relevance in a leaderless world—call it mask diplomacy—while at the same time spreading conspiracy theories to conceal the true origin of the virus. In this “global battle of narratives,” as the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, [called it](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/china/76401/eu-hrvp-josep-borrell-coronavirus-pandemic-and-new-world-it-creating_en), “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”

Italy provides the perfect environment to test Beijing’s strategy. It was the first Western country to be hit by a large coronavirus outbreak, and it is therefore urgently in need of medical supplies to support a health care system on the brink of collapse. But it’s also led by a government coalition that includes the Five Star Movement, a Euroskeptic and increasingly pro-Chinese party that has for years relentlessly promoted a stronger relationship with Beijing while downplaying the traditional trans-Atlantic alliance and fueling suspicion toward NATO. As a result, last year Italy was the first G-7 country to join the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure project.

Italy provides the perfect environment to test Beijing’s strategy. It was the first Western country to be hit by a large coronavirus outbreak; it’s also led by a coalition that includes the Five Star Movement, a Euroskeptic and increasingly pro-Chinese party.

Recently, China’s state media outlets suggested the new coronavirus originated in Italy, not in Wuhan, by shrewdly twisting the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi, the director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan. In an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/817974987) on March 19, Remuzzi said some doctors in northern Italy “remember having seen very strange pneumonias, very severe, particularly in old people in December and even in November,” an anecdotal fact that potentially suggested that the virus that originated in China had spread elsewhere even before commonly suspected.

The state-controlled *Global Times* [wrote](https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1241559268190343168) on Twitter that “#Italy may have had an unexplained strain of pneumonia as early as November and December 2019 with highly suspected symptoms of #COVID19, reports said.” A misleading version of Remuzzi’s statement was then broadcast by other arms of the Chinese government’s propaganda apparatus, such as China Central Television, and became a trending topic on the popular microblogging platform Weibo.

The Italian doctor, for his part, never even hinted that the coronavirus originated anywhere but China. “We can be certain that the virus emerged in Wuhan first, where it had probably been circulating for some time before it was made public in China,” Remuzzi told *Foreign Policy*, explaining that, if anything, the unconfirmed observations regarding previous cases of pneumonia in northern Italy would worsen—rather than ease—the burden of Chinese responsibility in covering up the early cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Genetic tests confirmed that the virus originated in China “beyond a shadow of a doubt,” said Remuzzi, who has recently been inundated with requests from Chinese journalists attempting to politicize his expertise to corroborate Beijing’s narrative.

### At the same time, Italy was the first beneficiary of China’s mask diplomacy. On March 12, a Chinese cargo plane bringing nine doctors, masks, respirators, and other medical equipment landed in Rome. The material displayed the words “The friendship road knows no borders” and was presented as a gift to the country going through the emergency. But it was not really a gift at all.

Italy was buying medical equipment from China, but the government took advantage of a parallel donation made by China’s Red Cross to make it look like an instance of its “politics of generosity.”

As the Italian reporter Giulia Pompili [explained](https://twitter.com/giuliapompili/status/1238508200938352640) in the [newspaper ](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/)[*Il Foglio*](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/), it was part of a commercial deal formalized a few days before in a phone call between the foreign ministers of China and Italy, Luigi di Maio and Wang Yi. Italy was buying medical equipment from China, but the government took advantage of a [parallel donation](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/) made by China’s Red Cross to make it look like an instance of its “politics of generosity.” A few days later, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the phone that he was willing to cooperate on a “Health Silk Road” to combat the pandemic.

Di Maio, who recently resigned as the leader of the Five Star Movement, is the point person for the Chinese initiatives in Italy and was instrumental in consolidating the partnership even under the previous government, when Five Star was the junior partner in the unorthodox, all-populist coalition with Matteo Salvini’s League.

“Those who scoffed at our participation in the Belt and Road Initiative now have to admit that investing in that friendship allowed us to save lives in Italy,” Di Maio [declared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7JRf6qaog) glowingly in an interview, sparking reactions from some of his Democratic Party colleagues in government, who are growing tired of seeing their political ally selectively praising China’s generous efforts while downplaying the belated solidarity coming from EU members.

“Many Euroskeptic leaders are acting as China enablers,” said Lucrezia Poggetti, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban personally welcomed a flight from China transporting nearly 70 tons of medical supplies, and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic theatrically kissed China’s flag when a team of doctors landed in Belgrade last week. “China is the only friend who can help us,” Vucic said, complaining about the lack of support from the EU.

“In Italy’s case, we can talk of ‘useful idiots’ fueling China’s propaganda,” Poggetti argues, insisting the term aptly describes Di Maio’s attitude toward China. “In part, he’s unaware of what he’s doing, in part he’s just trying to please the Five Star Movement electorate,” Poggetti told *Foreign Policy*. Meanwhile, the far-right League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, didn’t miss the opportunity to bash Beijing in order to hurt his former political ally (and now sworn enemy) Di Maio: “If the Chinese government knew \[about the virus\] and didn’t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity,” he [said](https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/politica/2020/03/26/coronavirus-salvini-cina-sapeva-crimine-contro-umanita_FGXtiR1tB3yPv9LIy313SJ.html?refresh_ce) during a debate session in the Senate, just a few days after re-upping on his social media an old [clickbait hoax](https://www.facebook.com/salviniofficial/videos/2752303571489985/) claiming that China was actively committed to engineering new viruses in its labs.

Southern Germany is Bavaria/Wuertemberg/Austria/Switzerland/etc. Those regions are not in Northern Europe.

- France: Your first obvious stop is pâtés. Fluffy, light, fatty and ridiculously sumptuous, you have the country style with chunks of meat and the straight up liver pâtés that are basically a cooked emulsion of fat and liver. In several different flavours, you can't go wrong. The summum (and costliest) item in French charcuterie is foie gras, fatty goose/duck liver, preferably seared and sprinkled with finishing salt, it'll make you slap your momma. Look up a local french butcher if you're in a large city, or the next best thing.

- Italian: Masters of pork and all its declinations, you could fill volumes (and it's been done numerous times) with all that Italian charcuterie has to offer with pork products. Beyond the obvious prosciutto and pancetta, I recommend guanciale (cured pork jowl) as an addition to various pasta sauces (specifically carbonara and all'amatriciana) and dry sausages such as the spicy calabrese, to start. These are personal preferences and account for less than .1% of what's available, just saying. Your local variant of Little Italy has you covered.

- Spain/Portugal/Brazil: Chorizo, duh. But beyond this wonderful, spicy sausage, Spain is the low-key king of the cured ham. While everyone is busy wrapping their cantalope in common prosciutto, Spain is out there feeding pigs with acorns and producing the world's most refined (and astronomically priced) leg of ham, Jamon Iberico de Bellota. Your snootiest deli will have it, it will cost you a fortune, and you will forever brag about the taste.

- British++: We're gonna go wide with this one and include Commonwealth products, such as South African biltong (basically beef jerky but, you know, exotic), Scottish haggis (it sounds gross but is amazing on toast or stuffed in a chicken breast) and Canadian bacon (no one in Canada calls it that, it's back bacon or peameal bacon and is made with the loin). Other than the above, the Brits specialize in breakfast sausages, fatty bacon and blood pudding. Americans only wish their breakfasts were this cholesterol-inducing good and all of it is available in most of the English-speaking world. Speaking of...

- America: Jerky and corned beef are the obvious frontier products from the good ol' US of A, but the innate advantage of America is its access to all the world's charcuterie innovations thanks to its immigrant population. But more, much more than this, they do it their way! America has done what many of the old countries would not dare and experimented with the old world recipes to give them new twists and flavour profiles. Once you've gotten a feel for the original recipe, do give the American Franken-creations a try.

- Eastern Europe: Poland, Czechia, Ukraine and Russia all rely heavily on garlic and paprika for their creations. They're not wrong. If you have a Polish butcher in your area, God bless you son.

- East Asia and Scandinavia: They salt fish and crustaceans. I'm not familiar with their products, but from my understanding, they are as good as they sound gross. Start yourself off with easy flavours like kimchi, salt cod, and prawn chips. Then dive into the deep end with surstromming and hakarl (fermented herring and shark). Go boldly where few men have gone before.

- Quebec: A short note of the products from my homeland; they're mostly like what you'll find in America, but with an obviously heavier influence from France, but there are a few special items. Cretons (a pork and breadcrumb breakfast spread) and Montreal-style smoked meat (very much like pastrami, but with different curing spices and exclusively made with brisket meat) are worth the detour.

However, I'd argue both the book and game don't go all the way with this. Basically, for a guy who's arc is supposed to be about growing past his anger and need for revenge, there's very little anger or lust for revenge from Ezio. He's mostly the same chill guy throughout the same game. We almost never see him actually get angry or emotional about his actions. Even his assassinations are mostly respectful and to the point (With Veri as one you mentioned but that's only one). As a result, there's not much of an actual growth or progression in his character. It feels like the game just says he's grown. His speech to Rosa about how he's grown falls flat because he's been the same person all this time.

The novelization makes some improvements here where Ezio kills 2 more of his targets in very brutal and angry ways before feeling guilty over what he did. Even Mario chews him out for it rather just say ""show respect"" and Ezio feels legitimately even more guilty about that. 

The problem is that these instances seem few and far between if at all. The game as a whole goes out of its way to make Ezio seem cool and likeable. As a result, his actual overcoming of his anger and need for revenge is hardly a factor. Most of the targets Ezio faces are just bad guys who happened to be on the list of people who killed his family. He doesn't really face any emotional challenge or grows from facing most of them. When his father and brothers are killed, Ezio's first concern is helping his remaining family get to safety. He needs extra assurance from his allies in Florence that his family are safe and he needs to kill the guy who betrayed them before he can leave with his family. When he's at Montergioni, Ezio refuses to go along with Mario's plan to become an Assassin to fight back, instead planning on taking his remaining family to Spain for their own safety. He barely agrees to get more training.

The end result is that it feels that Ezio is already that wise assassin who's overcome his anger and need for revenge. Think about it, if he had anger issues, wouldn't he drop everything to go after his targets which puts his family in even more danger and/or jeopardizes his missions? That would be far more interesting than Perfect Ezio where everything is fine and actually give him a path to improve. Imagine if when going to assassinate targets, he butts heads with the other assassins and learns to become more mature and wise as he sees how his anger messes stuff up. Now when he gives his speeches and is inducted into the order, it feels earned because we have seen that progress and it was actual progress.

And just at the last moment, he decided everything was simply not worth it, despite knowing Rodrigo is a Pope and has the army of the whole Europe under his command to seek vengeance on him and everyone he loves?

&lt;&lt;Thus Enver’s decision to launch a wintertime offensive with ill-clothed troops in the mountains is often presented as the epitome of stupidity and fanaticism. Total Ottoman losses were crippling but closer to 60,000 than the 130,000–140,000 of popular legend. One explanation advanced for Enver’s otherwise seemingly ineffable heedlessness for entering both the war and the offensive at Sarikamish is a deep-seated pan-Turanism, a grand desire to unite the Turkic and Muslim peoples of the Caucasus, Russia, and Central Asia with those of the Ottoman empire. Such an explanation is not convincing.   


As noted earlier, Ottoman mobilization plans deployed the army in the west, not on the Caucasian front. Despite the fact that an invasion of the Caucasus was the most obvious and straightforward way to bring the war to Russia, Enver settled on a Caucasian offensive only after discarding for geographic and logistical reasons other options of attack through the Balkans or across the Black Sea.79 The military stalemate in Europe led Germany and Austria-Hungary to press the Ottomans to launch an offensive against Russia sooner. Enver’s concept of encircling Russian units at Sarikamish and cutting them off from their rear was daring but not hare-brained and in accord with standard military doctrine.  \*Finally, the Ottomans made no effort even to present the operation as pan-Turanist.\*  


The tactical blunder committed by Enver at Sarikamish emphasized so often to underscore the alleged irrational pull of pan-Turanism upon Enver and the Ottomans in general – islessremarkablewhencomparedwiththerecordofBritish, French, and German generals ﬁghting on the western front in France, who sacriﬁced far greater numbers of lives over a longer period of time for no strategic advantage.&gt;&gt;

1. Obsessively loyal
2. Loyal and willing to overlook negatives
3. Loyal but judgemental
4. Judgemental
5. Obsessively judgemental




&gt;
1. Are the type of people to ship characters together and accuse any form of criticism as ""hating"" on the series
2. Are the people who use contrived EU details to explain away faults/plotholes in the series.
3. Are the people who who are willing to look past the clear faults and plotholes because they either suspend disbelief enough to enjoy what they're watching or just plain don't care about any of the plotholes etc
4. People who probably still enjoy what they're watching but especially enjoy pointing out what's wrong with it
5. People who find fault with every scene and character and find no enjoyment in watching our critiquing the movies at all.

I'm leaving out most people with this scale and purely ranking ""fans"" in the literally sense of the word. This isn't meant to be a serious scale, just a general one. The good thing about Star Wars fandom that keeps it from being stale is that everyone sort of disagrees with each other. It helps that Rick and Morty as a television show isn't taking itself as seriously as Star Wars is, which makes it harder to be passionate about.

With R&amp;M fans (and once again I mean fanatics), they're pretty much either obsessively into the show, or annoyed with the people who are obsessively into the show.

I can only speak as a Czech person who has travelled quite a lot and who has met many different people from many different countries. The reality is that we are a small country and so most people around the world are ignorant about us and that's fine. I am ignorant about many countries as well.

When it comes Western Europeans, it's a bit different though. They have an ignorant portion of the society as well however these people typically do not think they are ignorant about us. People from the rest of the world are aware they know close to nothing, but people in the Western Europe think they know quite some information about our countries. I guess this is because we are on the same continent and from time to time, they hear something about us in the media, or they know someone who travelled here etc. So this gives them a sense of familiarity and unfortunately it also gives them the confidence to spew ignorant bullshit.

It's like a combination of ignorance and arrogance. And because we are white just like them, they say it without the fear of being accused of racism. You would be surprised how casually they can say such things to you, even directly to your face and expect you to either agree with them (if it's some wannabe serious analysis/observation about our country) or laugh at it (if it's an attempted joke even if it's insulting as fuck). To give you an example, I was once given a long lecture by a British getleman who explained to me how nowadays, Prague is not a destination for sophisticated people (like him) because it's just a place where people go get shit faced drunk. When I tried to explain to him that Prague has way more to offer than just cheap booze and that many tourists in fact come for those purposes and it's just groups of young men from the UK/Scandinavia/Netherlands etc. who come here to get shit faced drunk, he got dismissive and did not want to hear it. I also stopped counting how many times I heard the ""joke"" from numerous Western European guys that because I am Czech, I must have been in porn or know someone who has. How hilarious right? 

But I am of course not saying similar stuff doesn't happen to other ethnic groups or that it doesn't happen in my country as well.

I guess what stinks about this whole thing is that you guys think of yourself as being these very open-minded tolerant societies and I feel like you are a little bit in denial about the portion of your society that can be downright xenophobic.

I like how that is the only response to anything you tell people that they don't want to hear.  The reality is that an iPhone or the latest Samsung Galaxy isn't worth £800 in parts. The reality is that we shouldn't be creating disposable smartphones that cost ~£20. 

We could easily let African countries (+Mongolia) control their own resources and we could a) pay a fair wage and b) build things to last. The fact that the bigger countries use a variety of hidden (to anyone who doesn't know where to look) neocolonial tactics to essentially be the ones controlling the leash and resources should horrify people. 

So, when African countries were struggling, they took out loans from the IMF and the IMF gave them huge, unsustainable loans. Europe and the USA essentially flooded the countries with huge amounts of clothes, inappropriate farming equipment (requiring gasoline) and this destroyed clothing industries etc. Of course, they were struggling off the backs of being decolonised in the wake of WW2. So when your people are suffering from famines and struggling for clothes because native people were often pushed into the undesirable parts of their countries...

The IMF (+Europe/America) and charities also didn't do any due diligence and essentially gave stuff to warlords.  Or actively sabotaged anything resembling stability if it was leaning towards communist/socialist/a bit of pink compared to the UK/USA especially. I have no doubt that the SU did the same to countries in Africa - it's one of the few parts of SU stuff I don't know much about. 

On top of this, missionaries continued their plague upon the African continent. They massively helped the spread of AIDS, helped in making sure African families stayed big e.g. no condoms, no birth control, no abortions for you. Convert and follow our rules or else. 

Oh, and also, getting involved with the UN and then refusing to actually help, using African countries to extract, dump, make, mine and refine hazardous chemicals. There's the selling of weapons and explicit support of dictators (similar to South America and Saudi Arabia) and fucked up policies (South Africa).  There was some debt relief, a whopping $76 billion for 30 countries in the last 24 years. 

For reference, Bezos is worth 119 billion dollars. 

Then the West, now with China/Russia in the mix essentially told Africa as part of debt relief that they needed to increase social spending. They continued the same bad practices.  Sadly, it's easier for the citizens EU/Russia/China/the USA to just assume that African countries naturally struggle because keeping them dependent is the idea. 

Just look at how the same thing applies to Mongolia &amp; South America. Are those countries naturally fucked up? No. It's also fucked up that people have trained themselves to just shrug. :/",True,False,False,,,0,1585724107,,False,2,{'gid_2': 2},fm3hwwu,False,t3_fspne1,False,True,t1_fm3a80x,/r/worldnews/comments/fspne1/the_trump_administration_is_ramping_up_airstrikes/fm3hwwu/,False,,1592802680,666,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,,4,[],

I personally think the film should have been less about finding Relic Maps (which was kinda the plot of the first sequel film anyway) and more about the gathering of forces for the final battle that they just skimmed over.



Show us Lando trying to convince old lady Hera to lead Twi'leks into battle, give us Sabine Wren as Mand'alor leading her people to battle. The Droid Gotra. Actual visible force ghosts for Anakin and Obi-Wan. Shriv and Zaya. The Chiss, even. Make it feel truly connected and have this whole build up as the main characters (Finn, Poe, Rey, and Rose) try and set up for this attack.



Have them infiltrate like Luke and Han and Leia on Endor perhaps.

That is pretty ridiculous and hyperbole, as is evident to anyone who knows anything about the death tolls, so I will admit that I didn't read the title.

&gt; Germany, after world war 1 was forced to demilitarise and was not allowed to build certain weapons of war. From memory I believe key ones were stealth warships, tanks and heavy artillery.

Actually, the provisions were more sweeping; the total amount of soldiers in the Reichswehr was to be no more than 100,000 men in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions; the Großer Generalstab (the Great General Staff) and ""all similar organizations"" were to be dissolved, and the Reichswehr was permitted only 4,000 officers; the Rhineland was to be demilitarized, and all military structures and fortifications 50km (31 miles) East of the Rhine were to be demolished, with a forbiddance on making new ones; military structures on Heligoland and Düne were to be demolished; they were forbidden from the arms trade; their navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and a maximum of six light cruisers not exceeding 6,000 long tons each, and a maximum of twelve destroyers not exceeding 800 long tons each (at a time when the average was around 1,000 long tons), twelve torpedo boats not exceeding 200 long tons each, and no submarines; naval personnel was limited to 15,000 men; officer count was not to exceed 1,500 men; Germany was forbidden an air force, and Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft for a period of six months.

&gt; Except Germany remilitarised pretty much right away.

Actually, the Germans began remilitarization of areas such as the Rhineland and (un)officially began violating the Versailles Treaty around 1935-6, when the Wehrmacht was established and replaced the Reichswehr.

For example, of the 100,000 allowed, the Wehrmacht recruited ~3.7 million people into its army, violating the treaty by a narrow ~3.6 million people, within the period of 1935-1939.

Now, I know how you are wondering. How the *fuck* did they keep that under the table? The answer? Appallingly bad investigation on part of the soon-to-be Allies, and such excellent cover-ups as renaming the *VsKfz 31* to the *""Leichttraktor""* (aka, ""light tractor""). They later introduced the *SdKfz 101* (""special purpose vehicle 101""), better known as the Panzer I. These excellent deception strategies worked masterfully on the soon-to-be Allies, because the soon-to-be Allies thought that if they bowed down to Mr. Hitler and gave him what he wanted (to an extent), he'd stop being so mean and play along with everyone else. That is why Neville Chamberlain (the sheer raw bucket of competence he was) decided to put in place the policy of appeasement, which prevented another war. Oh wait, it did nothing.

&gt; And even though AF LEAST the UK and America knew about it, they did nothing.

You really are overestimating how much the UK genuinely knew about German remilitarization, or even what Germany wanted. Anthony Eden, British Foreign Secretary, seriously thought that by ***1940*** they could persuade Germany to return to the League of Nations, accept armament limitations, and renounce territorial claims in Europe in exchange for remilitarization of the Rhineland, return of former German African colonies, and German ""economic priority along the Danube"" *(Crozier, Andrew; Appeasement and Germany's Last Bid for Colonies; 1988)*. 

The ones who *did* figure it out was the NKVD, which reported accurately in 1936 that Germany was going to remilitarize the Rhineland. Stalin, wisely enough, decided ***not to*** pass this information on to the Western (S.T.B.) Allies *(Shore, Zach; Hitler, Intelligence, and the Decision to Remilitarize the Rhine; 1999)*.

Besides, America wanted nothing to do with Europe at the time, so why would they give two fucks about Germany?

&gt; Because both of them WANTED another world war. Especially America.

You do know that British Appeasement policies were designed to ***avoid*** another war, right?

Also, America was in the middle of its isolationist phase at the time, and the, as you described it, war-hungry Americans waited until ***1941, two whole fucking years*** to enter World War II, and did so on December 8th, after being ***attacked by surprise in the infamous ""Hawaii Operation"", also known as the Attack on Pearl Harbor,*** which was later judged to be, oh, look at that, a ***fucking war crime*** *(Totani, Yuma; The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II; 2009)*.",True,False,False,,,0,1585726106,,False,0,{},fm3jvvu,False,t3_fsojt9,False,True,t1_fm3gc0b,/r/Trumpvirus/comments/fsojt9/while_other_countries_prepared_for_the_pandemic/fm3jvvu/,False,,1592803615,1,True,False,Trumpvirus,t5_2gg7fd,r/Trumpvirus,public,,0,[],

I think the major argument for global indices not being at the end - or close in my opinion - of the bear run is the timing for Q1 reporting. IMO the markets are trading off of sentiment (poor and worsening) and responding to fiscal and monetary stimuli from global governments. The tightening of the Indian labour market, Q1 reporting lag, worsening Covid situation in the US, UK, India and EU and rising unemployment leading to hugely reduced output are all reasons why the markets will worsen into the next quarter. Given the timing of lockdowns and damage to consumer finances, I’d say we have at least another 6 months of pain to go.

* The ECJ, alongside strong competition and anti-monopoly regulations (you would be surprised how many companies get sanctioned millions of euros for blatant cartel-formation, from air cargo to the people who build and maintain escalators and elevators (yes, really))
* Social security reciprocity (aka why you can retire in another EU country and keep your pension)
* An elimination of geographical discrimination in the internal market (aka why you can watch VRT while on the beach in Spain now)
* No roaming costs
* Defending our interests as a cohesive unit on par with the US and China

Among many many more! For example the EU also funds a plethora of NGO/civil society actors that occupy roles the EU is too cumbersome to fully address. These include everything from a European-level cyclist's rights NGO, to disabled rights groups, to even things like the European Cross Border Car Rental conciliation service (aka if you ever rent a car in another European country and they try to rip you off, as a European these guys will take them to court for you, at no cost).

 Doesn't make you right for doing it too though.

Most people here aren't saying stuff like that because the subject is a woman. They are saying it because the subject is a hypocrite. You can't seem to comprehend this, no matter how many times I say it. Most comments above would have been exactly the same, with different insults, if the subject were a man. ""White Knight"" is a term used exclusively for people who overprotect women even when they are in the wrong, but If a person tried to protect someone for the sole reason of let's say, their sexuality; they would have gotten similar reactions in another theoretical situation. Have you ever been to a fighting sub? ""That guy fucking deserved it"", ""That dude had it coming"" etc. So why should it be different for women specifically? Because they have a vagina? This is the nature of humanking in general. We inherently like watching people fight, that's why in schools or other places, when there is a fight you see people encircling it. I'm not a fan of violence IRL to be honest, haven't been in a fight since middle school. I usually ignore inferior people. That doesn't mean I hate seeing hypocrites getting spanked though. 

So in the end, this is just the same reaction people give to a male-male fight. Except people like you get butthurt because the subject here happens to be a woman. There is litterally zero difference. If you want to ban this subreddit for this reason only, you also have the obligation to ask for the banning of all the other subs that involve any kind of violence. Because comments there will be similar, just ignored because the subject is a male. 

Other than that, like I said, I once posted about how I parked to a all-women parking lot. I didn't know back in the day that they actually had a logical purpose. I got really aggressive replies of people calling me all sorts of insults, just for parking to somewhere I shouldn't have. I just can't see how this sub is still seen as a ""bastion of r/beatingwomen"". probably because of confirmation bias. 

Another sidenote, if we are doing generalizations, I'm gonig to go ahead and say that this whole site is racist, sexsist and possibly xenophobic. They are just ignored because the subjects to these are usually people other people don't care about.  I have been to r/europe a few times, and just because of my Turkish origin, people there insulted me, called me slurs etc. But I have never generalized the entire sub by saying it's racist.

&gt;The current spending on social protection is 21.3 billion. To give everyone 100 a week would cost 25.1 billion. But you can't cut all types of social protections and you would no longer need tax credits in this system so let's break it down a bit. If you gave everyone €100 per week it would cost 25.1billion assuming Google Irish population number is correct.

Seems about right to me 

&gt;Now if you get rid of tax credits. People in other categories get more but let's assume everyone who works is a single adult with no kids. A single person in Ireland gets 3300 in tax credits. So if everyone started paying tax from the first bit of employment they have that would make the state 11.15 billion assuming government numbers on employment rates are correct. It would also simplify the paperwork done by government for taxes lowering the need for certain civil servant jobs which could be redirected to somewhere they're more needed or terminated which would save the state more tax money.

While i agree on the financials, i don't see the cost saving for admin being all that much. Revenue are exceptionally lean and efficient as it is, and the payroll filing system is mostly automated. 

&gt;Supplementary payments could be stopped (electricity, gas, telephone, fuel allowance, ect.), people should budget for basic bills, just like how employed people currently do. Saving 813 million. Cut the community employment scheme, if all you want is work experience and not a job then volunteer rather than being cheaper labor to businesses at the government's cost. Saving 335 million

I think you're into some issues here. That 813m also includes rent supplement (but not HAP). Given that the UBI you suggest is €5000, you have the problem that some people will already now be worse off if you remove all of those supports. 

&gt;Admin of social welfare is currently 300million for pay and 266 million in non pay costs an 142 million in transfer costs. People are no longer signing off or on so that lessens the amount of admin needed. You are automatically registered when you're born and un-registered when you die. You have to set up a bank account once and after that if you change bank accounts it's the bank that deals with a movement of debits You still need a team to deal with new citizens and original sign on but you don't need regular meetings so 1 to 2 offices in the country would work. Let's assume the employees are all either kept or put to other civil servant jobs. You save 142 in transfer costs. Let's say you save 1/5th of non pay costs since you're no longer doing drop ins or regular meetings. You save 53 million.

People are going to have to sign on and off though because the state will still have to provide benefits above the €5200 per year UBI, as it is we provide more than €10,000 for those on welfare, those costs are still going to remain, all you'll do is reduce the payments due to UBI, not necessarily the workload, but in general i would suggest there is some saving to be made here, just not to such an extent. 

&gt;Pensioners and people on income supports are still getting money as usual as are illness disability and careers. Now the illness disability and careers supports (4.68billion) can't really be touched without damaging the disadvantaged. State pensions (8.43 billion) and Income support (3.29 billion) could be altered. Especially the latter. In many countries you only get income supports for the first 6months on unemployment, an amount that slowly decreases so you can adjust to living on less money or give you that boost to get another job. Ireland actually has this as job seekers benefit (3.54 million) let's keep this but half it since we now have BI. In fact let's keep all the other income supports (1.69billion) other than job seekers allowance (1.6 billion)

So it seems here you're reducing job seekers but again we can't leave people with less money that the get now, so we aren't really saving anything from what i can gather. I don't see the 3.54 billion figure anywhere either. Job seekers only makes 1.6 of the welfare spend so halving it would be possible but elimination isn't. 

&gt;Let's look outside of social protection spending. Education 11.2 billion 3rd level students no longer need the means tested grant supports as the have their basic income. Saving 376 million.
Skills development 589 million. Solas is mostly grants and free course for unemployed but some of it is handling internal money. Let's leave 89million for office work and pull the free classes. Most courses are either not fit for purpose or cost little enough the you should afford it from the basic income. Save 500 million Let's leave everything else as it is in education, our general system is pretty alright as it is.

That figure covers more than SUSI and the top rate for SUSI is also more than the proposed UBI. 

&gt;Agriculture 1.6 billion Farm sector supports are 864 million. If you can't make a profit what are in business, many farms in Ireland operate at a loss due to cost of machinery and not having enough land to profit off the machinery. If you want to tip away making nothing you can with the BI. If you operate at a loss you're a leach and making it harder for others to expand. Cut the supports. Saving 864 million You'd also save on administration no longer giving so many individual supports but we'll ignore that. Let's leave the rest

Agriculture is subsidised across the EU as part of the EUs policy of food security, without that payment we'd be overly reliant on imports of food. As it stands Ireland is the second most secure food nation in the world. I don't agree that agriculture supports can be scrapped, its also a massive employer and the loss of jobs and the cost those have to the exchequer needs to be considered also. 

&gt;Let's also leave health, transport and justice alone.

Absolutely agree

&gt;So cost for bi is 6.585 billion. State pensions 8.43. billion. Take €100 a week from each pensioner as they're now getting that much as bi. Number of pensioners approx 630,000

a huge amount from that pensions figure is made up from amounts paid in by teachers, Gardai etc.. that afaik are constitutionally protected as private property so i don't think you can just take €100 away but i'd need to check 

&gt; it'd cost 3.2 billion increased spending but a massive overhaul of systems. The most needy would get the exact same. Those long-term unemployed would be hit badly. Businesses operating at a regular yearly loss would be hit badly.

While i think your figures aren't accurate, i agree that it would require a major overhaul were it to be introduced and it simply wouldn't work with the system we have now.

I am less familiar with the situation in the US, but if it were true that all that counted were corporate interests and also that corporate interests were by their nature misaligned with the interests of the public then I don’t see how one could explain the massive expansion of social and environmental regulation over the last decades in many European countries. Or take as an example, Germany’s nuclear phase out decided in 2011. This is a policy decision with massive detrimental ramnifications for the vast majority of key industries in Germany, yet it was taken by a conservative government.

In my view, the reality is much more complex. In particular, corporations or rich investors do sometimes fight for some interests of a significant portion of the public and the resources they have available are not always due to rent seeking or exploitation, but sometimes because they excelled at promoting, servicing and/or harnessing these interests. 

Further there are perfectly valid reasons why supply driven subsidies are preferred by policy makers rather than demand driven aids to the public. Supply based subsidies can be much better targeted at the industries (including all people that work in these industries) that are most severely affected and what’s more the state often gets a return on these investments. Government bailouts to companies do not typically come in the form of free subsidies, but rather in exchange for titles (obligations, shares, etc.) and need to be paid back with interests. It is thus not meaningful to directly compare these to handouts.

First post, sorry for the long question.

In the U.S., Social Distancing is not strongly enforced.  So how well it works comes down to a measure of how scared the populous is.  The majority of people, at least where I am, are scared and staying at home and avoiding contact.

With fewer people exposed to the virus, it can’t spread as fast and we flatten the curve, limiting the number of infected and thus the number of deaths.  All good.  But aren’t we simply going to start over whenever we relax the mitigation?  With lax enforcement of Social Distancing, the chances of COVID19 cases being removed from the population is basically zero.  Thus the rate of spread accelerates again once the uninfected population comes into contact with the virus again.

My mental image is a very long period of on-again/off-again Social Distancing measures going on indefinitely, with an end (unless something changes\*) only when enough of a percentage of the population has been infected (and thus gained immunity) for the virus to die out, basically running its course.  Does the modeling suggest this ends anywhere other than a large percentage of the population (say 30%) eventually getting the virus?

Self-imposed Social Distancing out of fear in this case will be pervasive and long lasting, rather than going back to “normal” at the end of April, right?

\* I’m intentionally ignoring unknowns, such as if the virus will die down over the summer, and dramatic changes, like discovering a vaccine.

Certainly once people have isolated for 4-5 weeks we will have significantly reduced the number of contagious people, and the chances of any one person getting infected are low.  But that increases over time, just like it did when the cases originally came in to the U.S. from China and Europe.  As I understand it, mathematically this stops when a large enough percentage of the population has eventually gotten the virus, no matter how long that takes.

I’d like to be wrong and have Social Distancing fundamentally change the model outcome, but it isn’t clear why it would.",True,False,False,,,0,1585734466,,False,0,{},fm3rpd5,False,t3_frr754,False,True,t3_frr754,/r/COVID19/comments/frr754/weekly_question_thread_week_of_march_30/fm3rpd5/,False,,1592807324,2,True,False,COVID19,t5_2f4l19,r/COVID19,public,,0,[],

Ne doit-on pas admettre que certaines personnes pensent différemment et que ça ne changera pas et que pour le bien de nos relations on peut éviter certains sujets?

Personnellement, après des années passées à me disputer avec mes parents toujours sur les mêmes histoires, j'ai décidé d'arrêter de me prendre la tête. Je préfère éviter certains sujets et admettre que certaines personnes font des trucs que je considère bête. A l'inverse, certaines personnes trouvent surement ce que je fais bête. Je suppose que c'est inhérent à la vie, et si on pensait tous la même chose on s'emmerderait grave. Je pense aussi qu'en famille parfois l'atmosphère n'est pas bonne pour réussir à convaincre les gens (on est plus borné avec ces parents, on sera plus à l'écoute d'une personne extérieure etc.).

A l'inverse, j'ai déjà eu la discussion avec des potes à moi qui considèrent que j'ai abandonné. Et que c'est un peu ""lâche"" ce que je fais. Moi personnellement, je me dis que la vie est courte et que j'ai envie de profiter de ma famille d'une manière positive.

Un ex-voisin m'a un jour dit: pour pouvoir débattre, il faut que les deux partis soient disposés à dialoguer et à se convaincre mutuellement, sinon c'est juste exposer ses opinions. Et je finirai avec cette phrase d'Orelsan: ""Désolé si y'a pas que des experts à ta table"". Ben ouais, t'as peut-être un BAC S donc tu trouve que ce que ta mère fait est naze. Mais quelqu'un à côté a un doctorat en biologie médicale et il trouve ce que toi tu fais naze :D.

Sadly the positive comments stops there.

Yes China censored information and information got out late. But South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong received this information the same that everybody else did, and they are (or were) doing fine. Malaysia was doing incredibly well until a few religious gatherings led to the virus spreading out of control.The reason the situation is so dire in Europe and America is because your governments fucked up. 

Singapore was doing fine handling the virus when China was the centre of the outbreak. We were incredibly annoyed at having to deal with this shit because China tried to cover it up in late Dec, but we were dealing well with it, as were the other countries indicated above. 

But 2 weeks ago we had a sudden explosion in cases, most of them imported from the UK and America, and now the number of local cases is on the rise. It's not just Singapore, [it's South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong too](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/coronavirus-china-hong-kong-singapore-south-korea.html).

We probably would've kept it under control if Europe/ America contained the situation but nooooooooo now we gotta deal with the possibility of widespread community transmission because these other Western countries didn't give a shit because it's 'just a flu' and we in Asia didn't realise how fucking incompetent they were till it was too late. So why dont you all take a good look at yourselves first.

**Edit**: The other common argument I see is that China lied to WHO and western countries believed what WHO told them. 

You can blame China for lying to WHO all you want, but if you have a foreign affairs department, intelligence agency and health ministry, then the only reason you can be unprepared is because your country is incompetent. Or in the case of the US none of them are functioning but either way the blame lies on your government for not acting and letting the virus sweep your country. 

Also before someone goes MUH AUTHORITARIAN ASIAN REGIMES Im pretty sure Taiwan is more democratic than your beloved country so shut the fuck up.

Nothing prior to you converting will be held against you. When you became Muslim you started fresh, like a newborn baby. 

&gt;My husband has never been able to provide for me

Not a very Muslim thing to do. The man is duty-bound to provide basics for his wife and children.

&gt;He does not want me to work and had been very clear about that

But he won't either? I'm so, so sorry sis. I'm responding to each and every point of yours with a heavier and heavier heart... you should not have gone through any of this. I feel for you and completely understand that you are feeling hurt and confused. I don't like this man one bit. 

&gt;So currently we are relying on my mother and grandmother to help is out which makes me feel horrible to say the least.

Which self respecting man does that??? 

&gt;i'm starting to feel resentment towards him.

Not surprised at all.

&gt;i am not allowed to and have to say sorry. So i say sorry

What the hell? Why wouldn't you be allowed to speak your mind? A spouse is supposed to be a source if mercy and comfort, not someone you have to hide from or be under the thumb of. 

&gt;He starts screaming at me and pushing me in a corner and threatens me to beat me up,

He's threatening abuse... 

&gt;Now, he has decided to act like a baby and ignore me, not sleeping next to me, not speaking to me. When i ask for a hug he refuses when i hug him he's standing like a statue.

Blames *you* for *his own voluntary behavior*...

&gt;, a few weeks ago we had a fight where he hit me in the face (lightly) and pulled my hair on the bus where everyone could see it. I've lost count how many times he treathened to get a second wife to hurt me and i am in islam not allowed to leave him, and how many times he has treathed he would kill me.

Never mind, not only is he abusive but he isn't safe for you and your child to be with at all ... 



&gt;for the sake of Allah i want to work things out.

Allah swt does not demand us to, though. Why would you want to remain with a man clearly who isn't a good one, who endangers you and is a danger to your child? Sweetheart you have every right and every reason to leave. None at all, I repeat, none at *all*, to stay. 

&gt;i have no saying in this marriage, according to him. 

Scumbag is an abuser just using Islam as his manipulation tactic. He's a scumbag though, whatever flag he wants to wave at you to justify his scummy actions. 

I'm so sorry. But I don't see reason for you to stay. I'm afraid this man has already threatened you and has previously hurt you, you need to develop a plan and leave. I'm going to ask others to chime in since your post looks European and I'm halfway across the world with no idea how things work there but you need to speak to family and social services which will help you get out of this. You deserve to feel safe and you deserve peace of mind and spirit. You deserve the freedom entitled to every human. Not this. 

Start saving whatever cash you can. Can you talk to your mother and grandma? Get them on board, would they not be supportive of getting rid of this unemployed mooch? What about community? 

Kinda rambling now since I'm getting more and more upset for this sis' sake. Chime in please, let's help her get the help she needs?

20% zinc oxide is supposed to provide UVA protection that is on par with the UVA protection imparted by the new generation chemical UVA filters.

Amongst mineral sunscreens, the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc SPF 50 is likely the one that provides the most robust UVA protection. I say that because the company (Neutrogena) has actually released a UVA Protection Value for this sunscreen. It's 32, which is VERY high. 

Unfortunately, in my experience, this sunscreen is unwearable because of the white cast, thickness, greasiness and shininess.

Like you, I used mineral sunscreens EXCLUSIVELY for many years. I swore by mineral sunscreens and to this day I absolutely LOVE the low irritation profile and photostability afforded by mineral sunscreens.

Since I couldn't make the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc work for me, I eventually started experimenting with newer generation chemical sunscreens. These are NOTHING like the old school chemical sunscreens that use Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octinoxate, etc.. in the sense that they are NOT irritating at all and are very, very photostable. The filters I'm talking about are Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, and Uvinul A Plus for UVA protection and Uvinul T150 for UVB protection.

I'm currently using a couple of Bioderma sunscreens. Namely, the Bioderma Photoderm Kids Spray SPF 50+ and Photoderm Max Family Milk SPF 50+. The UVA Protection Value for these sunscreens is 39 and 42, respectively.

In contrast, most mineral sunscreens and old school chemical sunscreens have UVA Protection Values under 10. So as you can see, that is a HUGE difference.

I have to import these sunscreens from Europe to the US because the FDA is about 30 years behind on UV filter approval than (literally) the rest of the world. American sunscreens, for this reason, ""by definition/default,"" are HIGHLY inferior to European, Asian or Australian sunscreens. 

If you want to continue using mineral sunscreens, I've found a couple lately that I think are promising. 

Coppertone Pure &amp; Simple SPF 50 (this has a whopping 24.08% zinc oxide content)

And

Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 (20% zinc oxide)

And 

Ethical Zinc SPF 50+ (22% zinc oxide)

I haven't used any of these so I can't speak to the elegance or application, but they look promising.

The takeaway is, look for a mineral sunscreen that is SPF 50 AND contains 20% plus zinc oxide. The zinc oxide should ideally be ""non nano."" Those are the key things. I think you'll find that there aren't that many on the market, as I did. Zinc oxide is just extremely difficult to formulate with and 20% zinc oxide often renders a sunscreen completely unwearable.

Another thing to consider is using a tinted sunscreen, either as your primary sunscreen or a second layer. Tinted sunscreens usually contain iron oxides (this ingredient will start with ""CI"" on the ingredients list.) Iron oxides protect against wavelengths of visible light that play a role in the development of pigmentation.

More seriously, the USA have a real problem with a lack of real democracy.

Even if you ignore the legal bribes that are the campaign contributions, the gerimanderring, the electoral college, all of them big major issues, there is another major problem that is hidden in plain sight : the fact that there is only one round for the big election.

How many time have I read someone says that they had to vote for the lesser evil because a vote for a 3rd party would be a vote wasted ?

Two things about that : eitheir it is true, or it is not.

If it's false, then we have a system where people believe incorrectly that you can only vote for the 2 major parties.

Even worse, if it's true, then it means that you can only vote effectively by chosing the candidate of one of the two major parties.

Remember back during the soviet era when it used to be a joke saying that you could you wanted vote for any candidate as long as it was a candidate vested by the communist Party ? It wasn't real democracy back then, and only being able to vote for candidates for two different partie is only marginally better. Having old parties die and new parties emerge is part of a healthy democracy, it means that when you are really fed up and ""none of the above"" is your choice, new -viable- options can emerge.

But here in the good old USA, when you want ""none of the above"" and want to try to vote for another option, the very system tell you ""no it will have the opposite result of helping the worst candidate according to your belief""

The only way to break this for a start is to still vote 3rd party if you really are fed up with both main parties (of course, if one party still provide a decent candidate then go on), then you can fall back to another option.

Sure it's not perfect, but it would be much better that the current system.
With 2 rounds, the Dems and Reps would nto be able to just say ""I am slightly less worse that the other guy"" because if they do (like they are currently doing) and none of their options are even remotly good, then you can use the first round to send a clear support to a 3rd party, hopefully removing one of the worst option, and if not you would still be able to vote for the lesser evil during the second round, but here in Europe when this happen, the lesser evil (or lesser good when the candidate is at least semi decent) would have to begociate between the rounds with the 3rd party candidate if he wants his official support

A good democracy means that you vote for the candidate you believe is the better option.

Barring that, we owe it to ourselves to ensure they have enough power to halt any further erosion of rights or benefits. This ""we don't owe the Democrats anything"" nonsense is social media propaganda, designed specifically to get people like you to give up and ceding control to the manipulators. Putin loves that activists like you are disillusioned.

I don't owe the democrats anything. Nothing. There has not been a single progressive legislative win in my lifetime. Your party dead-ends progressive policies to protect the business class of this country. Lieberman is a fantastic example. One sacrificial lamb to stamp out progress and your party does not lift a finger the challenge that insubordination, how convenient. 

&gt;""The base"" is a meaningless term in FPTP. Winning swing voters wins elections. Unfortunately, there are plenty of on-the-fence Democrats or conservative Democrats who identify with Blue Dogs. We are a big-tent party and so we have to find common ground with folks like the Blue Dogs. That's how it always has been.

Mhmm. This is why I don't owe your party anything. Your party does not fight for progressives. This is why the republicans can hold so much power. The republican policy makers always throw red meat at their base. Racism laced laws, lower taxes, less social-safety net, wars or what ever you want to cite, Republicans deliver the policies their base wants.

I can count off A Santa-Clause sized list of policies the modern Republicans have accomplished for their base.
I can count on one hand the list of policies the modern Democrats have accomplished for their base.
I can count off numerous times your party has alienated my progressive values. 
It's not worth it anymore

That's why people don't turn out. Give Drumpf and the red hatters a simple majority and they ruin so many things in such a short span of time. That is what political conviction looks like. Disagree with their policies all you like, Republican politicians move the core party agenda forward and with great haste. Just look at the rate McConnell approves of judges and contrast that to 2008-2012. 

&gt;Because most of the party isn't involved in the nitty gritty details at that level. We have to defend weak Democrats. Winning purple states was the key to victory in the last midterm and it must continue going forward. Purity tests and drawing lines is how you dissolve the big tent coalition that is the Democratic party and end up with even less power.

Then why did Claire Mccaskill lose? She was a weak democrat that leaned far right instead of left, a very Machin-esque senator, and lost. The coalition dissolved itself when the country gave your party power and leadership did very little with it. Again, I will cite how hard republicans fight for shit, even with a simple majority. There is politicking involved in politics ya know? Look how Trump passed his historically awful tax bill, where was the republican super majority?

&gt;We gave them a tenuous and fleeting majority, and they gave us the health care plan that could pass with that majority. Again, why do you expect them to deliver more than what is within their power? They are not magicians. If we couldn't get it done (give them a strong majority), we cannot expect them to get it done.

There is plenty that can be done in the executive branch to change things in very influential ways. One example would be to mandate that all federal supply contracts for items like office supplies to first aid kits be purchased from US producers when available. That is something that is currently not mandated and that is in the executives jurisdiction, Trump did it for a single day or month? I don't remember the length. 

Again, I do expect Dems to fight when they have power, just like the Republicans do. Trump's tax cuts were passed with a simple majority through budget reconciliation. Do you expect change if one party is full of tenacious ruthless politicians and the other party is filled with conflicting views and no sense of unifying message? Good luck with that.

&gt;This ""bully pulpit"" shit is more social media propaganda. This aint the 1940s, the inherent power of the presidential pulpit is all but gone given the media environment.

Not bullshit, we see the republicans do it all the time. Look what happen to Republicans who oppose Trump. It works. When the president threatens to help any primary challenger against a dissenting incumbent, politicians fall in line. Democrats don't really support challenging incumbents. Just look at the AoC-Crowley, they were even going to try and run him anyways after he lost the primary until the story blew up.  

&gt;He didn't actually say he would veto it. He said he would ask how is it paid for, a common criticism of Sanders' plan. And that he wouldn't do anything that would jeopardize people's access to health care. Which sounds to me like he's in favor of a combined public and private system like many European countries have. It's just that progressives have planted their flag behind medicare for all and nuance is seen as defeat.

Sounds like a pocket Veto to me. If he does not agree with the bill, which he has said he does not because M4A will get rid of everyone's insurance and he does not want to gamble on that right now. 

&gt;Don't you see the problem here? It was youthful exuberance disconnected from the reality of what was possible. Being young and thinking you are going to change the world seem to go hand in hand. It turns out that the world is a lot bigger and a lot more immovable than it seemed. But this isn't a failure of the Democrats, this is just the fact that progress tends to happen one funeral at a time. Activism can be the difference in enacting policies that are razor close to passing. But its not going to change hearts and minds to any large degree.

I don't think you see the problem. I am not asking to change the world. I am asking for us to keep up with the rest of the modern world and we are falling behind. I know politics is a lot of sausage making, hence my political activism from an early age. The majority of Americans want M4A 

https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480719-poll-narrow-majority-favors-medicare-for-all

This is not pie in the sky and unpopular. Other countries have it and most of us want it! Pretty simple and straight forward. The problem is that the party that should be fighting for M4A as a core proposition, with unblinking conviction, is also sold out to the healthcare industry and compromises even a public option away. 

This is why I owe your party nothing. It gives scraps to it's base while asking for political loyalty. The republicans score policy win after policy win and cross another bullet off of the policy list. I never thought in my lifetime Abortion rights were on the chopping block, look how far McConnell has pushed that item. There is no single one issue the Democrats where they move mountains to accomplish a dearly held goal. The ACA was the closest thing and it was originally the Republican solution to healthcare in the 80's:

&gt;I admit you've done far more than I ever have or will ever do. It's because of people like you that we have the progress we do. But one thing to note about major progress is that it tends to coincide with social upheaval. The new deal would not have passed without the great depression, for example.

While I appreciate that you say that, I don't feel that we have progressed at all from a legislative perspective. Do you honestly think a NAFTA supporting candidate will be able to recover the rust belt at all? It's such a huge damn liability in crucial swing states and now we have a real crisis on our hands. I am honestly in favor of super delegates putting anyone in that did not vote for NAFTA, dealer's choice!

We need major progress and we are going down the 2003 path all over again. How do you not see this? Biden is Kerry all over again. 

&gt;This is just to misdiagnose the problem. ""The DNC"" didn't do anything against you. Democrats simply are not as progressive as you would hope, despite what you read on social media. There are far more Democrats or potential Democrats like Biden than there are Bernie. This is the reality of the electorate, and thus our politicians and policies are a reflection of that.

Amy and Pete both dropped out within two days of Super Tuesday and both endorsed Biden. Warren left Bernie high and dry weeks after ST and will most likely be in Biden's cabinet for her services. That was a unified establishment left vs a divided progressive left. Looked damn intentional to me. I would think the establishment wing of the party were stupid if they did not do that. It was the most logical path forward to help a moderate win.

If I was magically advising both Warren and Sanders, I would have had them rally together at some point, who ever was in the lead after super Tuesday. It's a smart political strategy and if you don't think that is what happened, I have a bridge to sell you. Plenty of backroom dealing going on for those day-before endorsements.

Jesus fulfils perhaps the most specific prophecy of the Messiah in Daniel 9:27 -&gt; ""And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,""

There is no question that Daniel 9 references Jesus the Christ. How do I know this? He came at the exact time prophesied. Let me back up a little bit.

24Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.25Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.26And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.27And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.

This command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem met its ultimate fulfilment in the arrival of Ezra in 457 BC with the decree of Artaxerxes. The sabbatical cycle was restarted at that time. The prophecy specifies 70 weeks. Now from 457 BC until Messiah the Prince would be 69 weeks. Using the well established prophetic day year principle, 69 weeks is 483 days which means 483 years. That brings us to the fall of AD 27, when Jesus began His ministry at the age of 30. In the midst of the final week, the Messiah would be cut off but not for Himself - His life was given for fallen man. Jesus died in the middle of the 70th week. The end of the 70th week brings us to AD 34 when Stephen was stoned with one Saul later called Paul assenting. This Saul is later given word from God that ""he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel."" Before then Jesus had given the command to go only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel. Now the command was given to spread the gospel among the Gentiles but God did not forget His chosen people. Paul was still to preach the gospel to the children of Israel but no longer was the command to largely restrict it to them but to preach the gospel to all.

This also fulfills Isaiah 49:6 - ""And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth"" Truly salvation has come to every nation on Earth not through OT Judaism which is largely restricted to Israel, Europe and Western nations with only 17 million adherents (the vast majority not being converted Gentiles) but through Christ who is preached in every nation on Earth, sometimes in secret to avoid the government, but with billions of followers of all ethnic backgrounds.",True,False,False,,,0,1585748138,,False,0,{},fm476k6,False,t3_fspa62,False,True,t3_fspa62,/r/DebateReligion/comments/fspa62/jesus_is_not_the_messiah/fm476k6/,False,,1592814687,1,True,False,DebateReligion,t5_2snuc,r/DebateReligion,public,,0,[],

What really got me to understand what's happening in China is this: 

Sure, China has 2 billion people. But it's not just a pile of people, it's people living on a territory, in different provinces. Imagine China is the equivalent of the whole of Europe, and every province is like a country. Under normal circumstances, people travel freely between provinces. But when they locked down Wuhan, they also put a stop to inter-provincial travel, which really reduced the spread of cases. 

The equivalent would be if the EU, for instance, would've closed all country borders at the beginning of the outbreak. 

Now, how early did China react? If you check out this really good [video from Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk), they have a graph with numbers of cases and the timeline. And according to that graph, they shut down the city on January 23, after only seeing 440 confirmed cases. The video also shows that by then, there were already over 12,000 infected people (who only got tested later, when they started showing symptoms.)

In comparison, Germany shut down borders around March 15, when there was already over 20,000 confirmed cases in Italy and 4,000 cases in Germany. 

That's for the numbers. The other part is how effective the lockdown was. On top of all the technological stuff like scanning health codes and mass SMS alerting residents of positive cases, there's also a social aspect. 

I don't think it's easy to understand to what extent people stayed home, if you've never been in China and understand how people live. 

The lockdown happened around Chinese New Year's, which like christmas and new year's in the West in that it's almost a full week of holiday. People were already off work, and the holiday got extended. They couldn't travel back to their hometowns because of the lockdown (thank god). 

Chinese people in big cities live in ""apartment blocks"", which is basically a gated community of multiple buildings on a giant block. These blocks have security, and the security guards would send you back home if you were out for no reason. Possibly even fever checks at the gate. Where my relatives live, there was only one gate open to get in/out of the block (of like 20 buildings). My grandma, for instance, goes out daily to walk the dog but hasn't gone out of the gates in weeks. 

People wear face masks, which is may not be the best tool to protect yourself, but really reduces the risk of you infecting others in case you're asymptomatic. (Ironically Chinese people do believe the masks protect themselves which is why they wear them.) 

Temperature checks at supermarkets, and at work once people started going back to work (outside of Wuhan). My uncle and aunt's office would issue face masks for workers, and that's in a province with only about 150 confirmed cases. 

Also, people have gone through other big outbreaks and know how deadly these infections can be. On top of that, China is just generally gross and people are much more careful about hygiene (like, don't eat anything off the floor even in your own house, only squat toilets in public places because people think it's gross to sit where other people sat, etc.)

it's demonstrably false. Falcon 9 and Heavy barely reached half of Ariane and Proton payloads and a third of delta iv heavy. SpaceX still has to demonstrate their rockets heavy lift capabilities. Same for seats prices, it only holds if you don't include the upfront payment they asked NASA.

Prima di tutto, quando la situazione era ancora molto gestibile da un punto di vista dei numeri hanno lasciato liberi tutti di fare quello che volevano.

The culture card has been pulled on a lot of Turkish kids in Europe as an excuse to not allow them better education.

I have cousins in The Netherlands and how the system works there is as follows:

At primary school they do a test called CITO and according to their scores and a combination of a lot of complicated stuff an ‘advice’ comes out, which determines the high school level. The levels at high school are VMBO (low), HAVO (medium for future bachelor degrees) and VWO (high for future uni degrees). 

Many schools and teachers (not all) abused the ‘advice’ system to give Turkish kids lower high school levels and because the parents didn’t speak Dutch properly and didn’t understand the system, they managed to put Turkish kids at VMBO or HAVO, even though their test scores were more than good enough for them to go to VWO and get a uni degree in the future.

While many Dutch kids went from VWO to uni, Turkish kids had to go to VMBO or HAVO and progressed all the way to uni by jumping through additional hoops which Dutch kids didn’t have to jump through. Often, Dutch parents could discuss with the teachers and get their kids the right education they deserved, but Turkish parents were ignorant and didn’t speak the language because they spent their years cleaning toilets or working in factories while the Dutch parents were well educated and knew the educational system inside and out.

What happened is that you had a whole generation of Dutch kids who quickly progressed from VWO to Uni and a huge group of Turkish youngsters who went to VMBO, progressed to HAVO in their second year at high school and then had a HAVO diploma. With that diploma they had to get a 4 year bachelor degree and on my after that they could go to uni. So the Turkish uni degree holders were always a bit older than the Dutch uni degree holders which had a negative effect on the Turkish uni degree holders who applied to jobs. On top of that, having the name “Abdullah” on your CV instead of “Hans” or “Mark” also had a huge effect.

When I lived in Holland they did a test by sending the exact same CVs with a muslim name and a Dutch name and 90% of the time the Dutch named person was invited but the muslim name person was ignored or turned down right away. Now there are companies in Holland who remove names from CVs to overcome this.

Things are getting better and European countries are not racist all the way, but racist individuals who work in education or HR/hiring departments at companies have lots of power to push their racist agendas.

They were perhaps cunning. But cunning is not synonymous with ""intelligence"". Thieves, for example, are cunning, as are rats. But their cunning often leads them to trouble and their own peril very quickly. 

American military might is inextricably tied to its (stolen) resource base. The notion of using the biggest club the world has ever seen to clobber others is not a sign of intelligence. The biggest idiot in history would have the same impulse. Point of fact,  dropping atomic bombs on millions of civilians during the period in question is probably the greatest act of tactical, military and foreign policy stupidity in history.

The European ability to steal the land from the very peoples that kept them alive for their first many winters is, again, not a sign of the outstanding intelligence that you claim.

I would also argue that the left has always been a champion of individual freedoms more so than the right and history has proven that time and time again (Civil rights, Nazis, Facists) Your idea that the liberal western leftist wants state controlled everything is an ideological farce invented by actual authoritarian figureheads that want to radicalize the right.

YOU can absolutely hate Trump and also hate Xi and the CCP while defending Chinese against hate crimes. I would never defend Xi. But most certainly I would attack trump for just being a complete idiot and using hateful rhetoric as a way to rally his base. There have been hundreds if not thousands of hate crimes that have acquiesced due to Trump saying “China” virus. It’s literally the same crap Xi is pulling in China.

And to be fair, we saw the writing on the wall when China shut down their country and yet we refused to acknowledge how serious this was. Oh yeah it’s easy to blame China now for hiding this crap, and they should get blame for not accurately reporting their numbers, but they literally shut down their entire country and we just blindly accepted it as a way of life there, ignoring the warnings until it got out of control in Europe. And by then it was too late. I wonder why your conspiracy laden articles on Drudge Report won’t report that?

Rather, it would mean mutualising any new debt generated by the fight against the pandemic


But then ESM is the better choice because it can specifically help countries that have been affected. 

It's not as easy as he makes it sound, because Italy's old debts influence the rates at which it can borrow money and it has to pay higher interest rates than countries like Germany or the Netherlands - that's why these countries have an issue with that. 

I definitely don't want to paint Italians and Spanish people as lazy, because that's just not true, but if you think about the European countries as siblings, it's as if some got lucky, some made good investment choices, some made sure the people they rented to paid their rent; and others got a bit unlucky, or an investment fell through, or their rentors refused to pay. 

If all of these siblings go to the bank seperately, the bank will offer them very different interest rates, with the unlucky ones having to pay more interest on their loans, making it even harder to get out of a slump. That's how the market works, but it can be seen as unfair because it keeps someone down who is already not doing so well. 

On the other hand, if all the siblings pool together for a loan, they'll get an average interest rate. That's potentially ""fairer"", but it means that the luckier ones have to pay more interest on their loans than they would have had to normally. 

I understand both sides, but I think shared bonds need one fiscal union. It's not unfair for the siblings with lower interest rates to say ""okay, let's take a loan together, but then let's also find ways to make sure all our rentors pay their rents (/our whole population pays taxes)"".

There are six factions with different relations between themselves. They're basically the merchants, the police, the sailors, natives, science-heavy middle east and religion-heavy europe. The latter two are at war. 

You're the cousin to (and work as a Legate for) a governor who is part of the Congregation of Merchants, who tries to stay neutral to all of them.

I'm curious if anyone else here has read the research that led to this project; I actually remember reading a piece by Hudson back in college while getting my dust-gathering IR degree. Turns out the piece is available on WomenStats site (""The Heart of the Matter: The Security of Women and the Security of States""). I'm pretty sure this is the research at the heart of the project.

I've gone back and re-read it, and there are a couple gaps in the otherwise fascinating introduction that I'm struggling to wrap my head around, chiefly that Hudson and company don't touch at all upon the history of Colonialism as a potential factor in why only Europe provides suitable security for women.

It seems too great of a coincidence to me that the states that managed to lay groundwork for women's security and involvement in civil society/governance - ie the states that come closest to breaking free from the society-wide reproductive strategy of patriarchal violence that then leads to instability, as per the project's thesis - are also the wealthiest and furthest from intra-societal competition over basic resources as well as the beneficiaries of colonialism, imperialism and their legacy in the current global economy.

Interestingly, these researchers seem to intentionally divorce feminism from critiques of capitalism and colonialism. The following quote, for example""

""Interestingly, several theorists believe that the rise ofdemocracy is rooted in the amelioration of violent patriarchy. For example,some have posited that the social imposition of monogamy and later marriage
for women (leading to a lessening of gender inequality) were necessary,though not sufficient, conditions for the rise of democracy and capitalism inthe West"" 

... IMO leads to uncomfortable questions the researchers don't ask. Why did that evolution only occur ""in the West?"" What does it mean that ""the West"" kept gender-equality evolution and democratic evolution solely ""within"" while inflicting debilitating violence - including sexual violence - on societies with which it was at war, up until the last few decades when forms of neoliberal interventionism that don't risk the global flow of resources became feasible? 

I'm a layman who tries to read what he can, so I def don't know the intricacies of how feminist and Marxist theory intertwine or clash, or if feminist theory as a whole is currently moving away from Marxist critique as a complementary framework, but completely avoiding it in your introduction, even if to explain why it's *not* a part of your theoretical framework, seems like an intentional choice given the historical relationship.

There's also the chance that this 10-year old paper isn't completely up to date on the research team's findings, of course. Just curious what others who know more - or can correct me if I'm wrong in my impressions - think. My impression of this sub is that it would not agree with the neoliberal prescriptions the researchers suggest elsewhere on the site, but that doesn't mean their thesis, methods and conclusion - that societal violence is rooted in interpersonal gender violence - isn't true.",True,False,False,,,0,1585753715,,False,0,{},fm4gkg2,False,t3_fsf4a3,False,False,t1_fm10sac,/r/FemmeThoughts/comments/fsf4a3/the_womanstats_project_fate_of_nations_tied_to/fm4gkg2/,False,,1592819146,5,True,False,FemmeThoughts,t5_2ucc3,r/FemmeThoughts,public,,0,[],

&gt; Wednesday 13 is a horror punk band, fronted by Wednesday 13 of Maniac Spider Trash, Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13, Murderdolls, Bourbon Crow  fame. The group formed in 2004 and continue to play.

&gt; The genre of music is a mix of death rock and punk with lyrics heavily inspired by horror movies. All music and lyrics are written by the vocalist Wednesday 13. All guitars, bass, keyboards and vocals on the recordings are by Wednesday 13. Coner drummed on their debut album, whilst Kid Kid and Piggy D provided some back up vocals.

&gt; After Wednesday 13's primary band the Murderdolls went on hiatus, he went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March 2004, called the ""Graveyard A Go-Go"" tour. For his live performances he was joined by members of Florida horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent.

&gt; When Wednesday 13 returned to North Carolina in June 2004 he began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform with under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in a former Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13 member Ikky on guitar. The band took heavily influenced by the likes of KISS and Alice Cooper, while at the same time not straying far from the band members previous horror punk related projects. In September 2004 Ikky was replaced with Matt Montgomery also known as Piggy D.Together the Wednesday 13 band toured Europe in November 2004 on the ""Look What The Bats Dragged In"" tour, some of dated were supported by English rockers Viking Skull.

&gt; In 2005 after touring, they released their debut album ""Transylvania 90210"", and made a promotional video for the track ""I Walked With A Zombie"", the video depicted the band members in footage from the original Night of the Living Dead horror movie. Following the albums release the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom; ""Tour from the Crypt"".

&gt; Also in 2005 they played on the main-stage of Download Festival at Donington, but perhaps the crowning moment for the group so far was when they opened some shows for their idol, Alice Cooper around Halloween.

&gt; Wednesday 13 parted ways with Roadrunner Records, before signing a new deal with Rykodisc, which then released a new album on named Fang Bang on September 12th, 2006.

&gt; During March and April of 2006 all of the members of the band parted ways with Wednesday 13, first the bassist Kid Kid, to concentrate fully on his solo project. It was announced that Argyle Goolsby of Blitzkid would be filling in at three live shows, before the band found a permanent replacement. Then 13 announced that guitarist Piggy D and Ghastly had also left the band, 13 stated that he maintains an amicable relationship with all the former members and wished them luck.

&gt; On the band's official website, 13 wrote that there would be a special Wednesday 13 line-up for a Cancer research benefit concert, and the following gig. This line-up brought Wednesday 13 and his Murderdolls band mate Eric Griffin back together for the first time since 2003. Griffin took on guitar playing duties, also joining him was drummer Racci Shay and bassist Brix from the band Dope . It was later announced that this line-up, aside from Brix would be permanent. After Brix left the band Nato Manor joined the band on bass. And after Eric left the band a much more talented guitarist J-Sin Trioxin joined the band.

&gt; In the middle of Europe tour 2007 Racci's dad died and so he was replaced by CombiChrist drummer until the end of the tour. And because Wednesday was still recovering from injuries they got a second guitarist.

&gt; 
The Band toured in early 2007 with Vains of Jenna, and recently announced a summer US tour with The 69 eyes, Fair to Midland &amp; Night Kills the Day

[],,JasonMadsun,1513723189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ox3g2qj,False,False,[],"Eu já adiantei a conclusão, então vou apresentar as premissas:

1) O discurso no qual o Presidente chamou o Covid-19 de ""gripezinha"" de ""resfriadinho"" foi um desastre total e colocou ele em rota de colisão contra o Ministério da Saúde, Governadores e a maior parte da Sociedade Civil, vide panelaços que incluíram até eleitores bolsonaristas arrependidos, e inclusive coincidiu com a data do discurso no qual o Comandante do Exército, General Pujol, que disse à tropa sobre a seriedade e a gravidade que o desafio do Covid-19 representa para a nação, ou seja, o presidente descreditou o Ministro da Saúde, o Comandante do Exército,  os  Governadores e Prefeitos, criando, assim, uma dissonância cognitiva nacional.

2) O presidente está politicamente isolado, aliados, outrora fervorosos, estão se afastando dele; Quase a totalidade dos governadores estaduais estão contra o presidente. 

3)  O vice-presidente já desautorizou o presidente ao falar que o governo federal só tem uma posição ""isolamento social"", e ao gesticular reprovação da fala do presidente, na qual o Bolsonaro criticou o Dória durante a reunião com os governadores.

4) O Ministério da Saúde comprou a briga e não tergiversou no posicionamento de que o isolamento social horizontal é medida necessária para enfrentar a crise. Os demais ministros também tomaram partido e apresentaram discursos condizentes ao do Ministro Mandetta, vide Sérgio Moro e, até mesmo, Paulo Guedes.

5) O formato dos painéis ministeriais apresentados pelo Ministério da Saúde foi alterado. Agora as apresentações são lideradas pelo Ministério da Casa Civil, que é do General Braga Netto, quem coordena todas as perguntas e respostas da apresentação. Curioso observar que quando a imprensa perguntou ao Ministro Mandetta se  a demissão dele já estava sendo cogitada \[afinal, o próprio Presidente disse que se fosse criticado o demitiria\], o Ministro Braga Netto interrompeu o jornalista, cortou o Min. Mandetta, e respondeu  que ""Não há qualquer conversa no sentido de demissão do Ministro Mandetta"". Só que em seguida, o próprio Ministro Mandetta retrucou: se a imprensa pergunta e governo diz que não existe, é porque existe \[a intensão de demiti-lo\]. Vale conferir esse trecho do painel interministerial.

6) O último discurso do Bolsonaro não tem a assinatura do Carluxo. Na verdade, sequer parece um discurso dele, pois carece de elementos característicos como ofensas, indiretas, acusações e argumentos infundados. Parece uma correção de rumo, o discurso do presidente se amoldou aquele do Ministério da Saúde. Nas palavras de Gilmar Mendes: o rabo abanou o cachorro. Suponho que a ala militar tenha tomado a frente do governo nos bastidores, mormente pela centralização da atuação Ministerial nas mãos do General Braga Netto.

7) Menos importante, porém algo que não deve ser ignorado, é que o próprio Olavo de Carvalho já cogitou ser tarde demais para qualquer reação do governo Bolsonaro.

A minha hipótese é que os militares já assumiram a presidência nos bastidores, porque há claramente um estado de anomia, criado pelo próprio Bolsonaro. O presidente perdeu o governo. A palavra dele caiu em descrédito e a presidência dele, em meio a maior pandemia dos nossos tempos, é uma tragédia anunciada. Em um momento que é preciso coesão nacional, uma voz uníssona que assegure à nação de que ""vamos passar pela crise"", você  tem o presidente contra tudo e todos. Os militares sabem, ou deveriam saber, que o prognóstico para o pico da crise não vai ser nada favorável caso o presidente não caia na real e volte a seguir os mesmos passos que estão sendo tomados pelo Ministério da Saúde, governadores e pelos principais países do mundo. O Presidente tentou, mas perdeu a queda de braço contra tudo e todos.

Enfim, por  se tratar de uma mera suposição, a conclusão de que os  militares já tomaram as rédeas da presidência da república, ainda que implicitamente, deve ser tomada *cum grano salis*. Vamos o discurso que está para sair hoje, quarta-feira, se ele voltar a atacar como fazia antigamente, pode desconsiderar tudo o que eu disse. Mas se o discurso for novamente ""sóbrio"", e em comunhão com o que tem sido dito pelo Ministério da Saúde, então, haverá mais  um reforço à essa hipótese, de que os militares já tomaram as rédeas da presidência.",True,False,False,,,0,1585756180,,False,0,{},fm4l5pb,False,t3_fso6vt,False,True,t1_fm382ux,/r/brasil/comments/fso6vt/em_pronunciamento_bolsonaro_volta_a_distorcer/fm4l5pb/,False,,1592821359,2,True,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,r/brasil,public,,0,[],

Your comment was definitely not entirely wrong or anything, but it's *completely* blindsided to the more violent/negative elements of the spread of Christianity.

And now I see a strawman argument against some ""christianity is literally evil and never did anything positive"" argument I've never made. Won't even respond to that, I'll only show some things that counter your narrative of the christian transition being pretty much peaceful ""like the current atheist transition"".

A one minute Google search is already enough to find at least a few examples  of why your ""christianty spread peacefully, not unlike atheism today"" is complete nonsense.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/catherine-nixey-darkening-age.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/catherine-nixey-darkening-age.html)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_pagans\_in\_the\_late\_Roman\_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire)

You're the type of person who'd say things like ""it's due to Christian Monks that most of Roman texts have been preserved"" while completely ignoring that mass book burnings by christians are partly the reason we lost 90% of the texts in the first place. They're disingenuous half-truths. Mixed with blatant untruths like ""temples were not destroyed"".

I also like how you ignore that practicing paganism was punished by death in Christian Rome and instead ""counter"" by asking questions and saying broad things like ""Ancient Rome always had the ability to take influences from other cultures"". Yeah, about that. Rome had freedom of religion, with many pagan religions and also Judaism living together in peace. Christianity first had this freedom too, but later was the only religion to be persecuted. Wonder why... because they *couldn't* live in peace and respect other religions like the rest.

And again these disingenuous half-truths about ""coexisting"" in Northern Europe. There were crusades in which pagans were killed or forcefully converted. Of course this didn't mean the entire population would magically become devout Christians overnight. Pagans endured in the rural areas especially, where Christian governments had less power projection. Christians systematically tried to erase paganism by forbidding traditions where they could and Christianising them where traditions were too popular to be banned. There were also more violent campaigns like ""witch"" hunts (if you didn't know, within Northern paganism, women had the role of keeping pagan traditions alive and teaching them to children. ""Witches""). These were all measures to actively wipe paganism off the map and Christianise the population. Insofar they survived, they didn't ""coexist"", but *endure.*

About the Barbaric invasion, they tried to reinstate pagan rights. Many local pagans that were left actually joined this insurrection. The Eastern Roman Empire launched an assault on them and eventually executed the barbarian leaders that sought to reinstate religious freedom. After the Eastern Roman Emperor installed his own leader in the West, he created very harsh anti-pagan laws.

Your comparison with the current social change towards atheism would work if:- we had an authoritarian atheist government that banned christianity on the punishment of death and actively tried to turn christians atheist.- all churches were closed and either destroyed or transitioned into libraries or something.- the christian population was forced to go underground and persist this way, while still persecuted.- all of christianity was constantly propagandised as ""evil"".Just to name a few things

But sure, this local workshop made pagan stuff too, therefore there wasn't a large scale anti-pagan movement going on lol

I mean, what do you expect from people who actively murdered even christians with different interpretations? People that destroyed catholic art en masse because it was ""too pagan""? What would you expect these people to do with actual pagans and actual pagan art?

Let me just quote a bit from the first:   
 

*So why don’t people like being asked what they do?*

*Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.*

*Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.*  

*Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.*

*Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on divorce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.* ",True,False,False,,,0,1585759400,,False,0,{},fm4rdia,False,t3_ft15nq,False,False,t1_fm4mzod,/r/etiquette/comments/ft15nq/it_is_so_rude_to_ask_about_someones_job_or/fm4rdia/,False,,1592824363,9,True,False,etiquette,t5_2r6p3,r/etiquette,public,,0,[],

* Segundo: se não for circuncidado (se não tiver pele que cobre a glande, que é o capacete do bombeiro), desempacota a cabeça pra não ir mijo pra todo lugar quando/se balançar Isso diminui exposição à urina e melhora a mira.  

  
* Terceiro, depois que acabar de mijar, ao invés de balançar o pinto e espalhar mijo pra todo os lados, você pega na base do pau (bem acima das bolas)e e aperta a uretra (que fica na parte debaixo da rola) e puxa até a ponta. Isso vai diminuir as gotas pós mijo porque você está praticamente esvaziando a mangueira. Igual bombeiro faz com mangueira profissa pra não apodrecer. Pode ser que você acabe com um pouco na mão mas é só mais um motivo pra lavar as mãos de novo. Mesmo se não pingar, por favor lave as mãos.  

  
* Aqui é que o negócio complica. Se for no mictório, nao tem papel higiênico e vai ter que balangar mesmo. Não deve sobrar muito se você der a espremida. Se for no vaso estiver papel higiênico disponível, é melhor secar a ponta do que balançar: menos mijo espalhado e o pau fica seco. Depois de secar não deve ser necessário balançar.  

  
* pau seco é melhor porque fede menos e dá menos problema. Tem nego que tem muita pele ou pele muito apertada e deixar seco evita complicações.  

  
* No banho, lava o pinto direito puxando a pele, com agua corrente e sabão. Pinto não é auto limpante e se não lavar direito vira fábrica de queijo polenguinho (QUE NÃO É NORMAL).  

  
* Pra receber um boquete, o melhor é lavar com sabão e água ANTES do boquete. O(a) dono(a) da boca dando boquete vai apreciar a não ser que tenha fetiche de mijo ou polenguinho.  

  
* Como bônus, você pode pedir pra namorada, esposa ou peguete pra fazer isso pra você. Não é pra qualquer um mas mulher nunca teve que fazer isso e pode achar interessante.

In some cases you reviewed the outcome of your own predictions more favorable than I would. 

I think there's room for improvement wording predictions. Currently some are too vague, giving them a wide bandwidth of interpretations. This renders the judgement of the prediction afterwards tricky. See some [examples highlighted in yellow here](https://i.imgur.com/S7w2NZm.jpg). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some are only loosely supported by the provided sources. Some are stamped as ""came true"" by stretching (or ignoring) the meaning of the quantifying words ""a lot"", ""severe"" and ""massive"". 

I must admit I'm not a up to speed of the situation in the US (I live in Europe), but I've got the impression it's not the general view that above specific quantifiers are currently met. Happy to be corrected on this.

&amp;#x200B;

The prediction on the amount of *deaths by the end of 2020* can obviously not be judged at the moment, and should be made separately from *deaths by the end of March*.

&amp;#x200B;

More in general: editing a post with predictions a few days later potentially makes the (perceived) value of the predictions lower. Incoming first time readers could suspect the predictions have been adjusted in the edit.

Put the predictions in a numbered list. This facilitates ease of discussion. 

Use absolute times/dates (or ranges) instead of relative. Write *before the 1st of May X will have happened* instead of *in a couple of weeks...*. It's more concrete and also facilitates future discussion.

They came to Ireland and mixed with the natives of the South and West, who themselves are supposed to have been of low type and descendants of savages of the Stone Age, who, in consequence of isolation from the rest of the world, had never been out-competed in the healthy struggle of life, and thus made way, according to the laws of nature, for superior races.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Scientific_racism_irish.jpg)

Does this count? It is clearly claiming the ""Irish Iberians"" to be more similar to ""Negroes"" than ""Ango-Teutons"".

What about this bit in Benjamin Franklin's infamous essay:

&gt;Which leads me to add one Remark, that the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny; Asia chiefly tawny; America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians, and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who, with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we, in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? Why increase the Sons of Africa, by planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

It specifies who Ben considered white - Irish is not listed either way, but considering Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians, Swedes and Germans (well, *most* Germans, a convenient exception made to the Germans that conquered England at some earlier point because that would make his whole point a bit awkward by excluding a bunch of Englishmen) don't make the cut I think it's safe to assume he wasn't particularly inclusive of the Irish in his definition, either.

Do you not think it's weird that anti-Irish sentiment invariably connected them to [apes](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8908225c711a8ad58e36e334a4f050a/tumblr_n2l6cg3Sdo1sjg84qo2_640.jpg) and [monkeys](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2dd91ad6afea408b004428bf3635703/tumblr_n2l6cg3Sdo1sjg84qo6_640.jpg)? Do you really think the message here was too subtle?

**Knockwurst, or knackwurst**, is a thick sausage that originated in the Holstein (northern) region of Germany in  the mid-16th century.. Knockwurst contains ground pork, veal, occasionally beef, and garlic. These ingredients are then put into a casing, aged for a few days, and smoked over oak wood.

**Boiling Knockwurst**

1.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a large pot 3/4ths of the way with water. ... 
2.Turn off your stove. Let the boiling water settle for a minute or two. ... 
3.Place the knockwurst in the hot water for 10-15 minutes. ... 
4.Remove the knockwurst from the water. ... 
5.Serve the knockwurst with garnishes

**Pan-Frying Knockwurst**

Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil into a saucepan. You can use olive, canola, or peanut oil to fry your knockwurst. If you want to inject more flavor, sauté onions in the oil before you cook the knockwurst.[12]

 If you sauté onions before cooking the knockwurst, remember to season them with salt and pepper.
 Cook the knockwurst for 10-15 minutes. You can cook the knockwurst whole or cut
 into pieces. As you cook the knockwurst, turn them regularly to ensure an even cook
throughout. The outside of the knockwurst should be brown.

**Sauerkraut**

Sauerkraut is finely cut raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria. It has a long shelf life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid formed when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage leaves. This is done by simply adding salt.

Although ""sauerkraut"" is a German word, the dish did not originate in Germany. Some claim that the Mongol Emperor Genghis Khan brought it to Europe. Others claim that it originally came from China and surrounding areas and that the Tatars brought it to Europe, and improved upon the original Chinese recipe by fermenting it with salt instead of rice wine. It took root mostly in Central and Eastern European cuisines, but also in other countries including the Netherlands, where it is known as zuurkool, and France, where the name became choucroute",True,False,False,,,0,1585760182,,1585771070,0,{},fm4suv7,True,t3_fswa2e,False,True,t3_fswa2e,/r/tonightsdinner/comments/fswa2e/tonight_i_had_knockwurst_with_1747_maille_mustard/fm4suv7/,False,,1592825080,1,True,False,tonightsdinner,t5_2qxea,r/tonightsdinner,public,,0,[],

As i said, israel is thriving. We faced war on all sides from the moment we came  into existence. As the years progressed we became a powerhouse despite being at war, and we also managed to make peace with those that were willing. All the while creating a diverse democratic society with freedom of religion, expression, the press, and political expression. It’s an amazing history we have.

 If they can’t accept that Israel is here to stay, they’ll lose the ability to determine the borders of their two states. We’re sick of the conflict. It’s meaningless. Israel will determine borders unilaterally and that will be the end of it.

Like, what is the point of your argument if we are all related? individual genetic legacy wouldnt be a thing that biology wants to maximize so  evolutionary fitness would not be a reason to monogamy. 

The Khan data is not merely related, it is direct male descendents. This happens due to systemic longlasting legacies of power that monogamy would never achieve. And it isn't just genghis Khan, but even without individual genetic data of powerful men in history, genetic signals of such men reverberate in the population data for centuries and millennia. We dont have genghis Kahn's dna, but we see its clear signal in population genetics. Again, not merely related, but a direct male descendents as a significant proportion of a population as a result of many generations of hundreds of children, systemic depopulation and controlling the sexual access of other men. Turns out to be a good individual strategy for genetic legacy and fitness, generally pretty miserable for society. 

Bloodlines dont last without maintaining that kind of systemic power, including sexual access. Even the european feudal powerhouses of the post-Black death dont boast genetic lineages even fractionally large as khan or other patriarchs because of monogamy and their limited childbirth rate and survival to adulthood  just does not compete for the kind of extent of genetic legacy. Many such powerful families actually go extinct in their patrilineal lines, not form a sustained impact on world population genetics. Like, these are the wealthiest and most powerful people who have fathers that have the most to invest in their limited natural children and they dont survive monogamy.

Individual survival rate of contemporary monogamy (or evolutionary psych theoretical paleo-monogamy bs) doesn't trump hierarchy and patriarchy and murder for genetic dispersal. Again, this doesn't mean patriarchy is good, but it does caution reifying contextual facts like how monogamy materially benefits children in heterosexist capitalist societies (through their exploitation by extremely wealthy families and limiting women's freedom) and turning it into biological fact. 

There is a lot more going on in fitness than raising direct descendants. However, your argument for fitness of monogamy over patriarchy does not stand at the individual decisionmaking level.

In Europe the advantage is less, but in Europe with a Tesla you can also use any CCS charging station too. Tesla still has the largest unified charging network of 100+ kw chargers in Europe.  The closest thing to it is the ionity network which is growing but 224 charging stations with vast majority of them being 4 chargers vs 519 stations in Europe with an average of 9 chargers per station. The distribution is also much better for Tesla. **Compare the maps for Tesla vs ionity for Italy/Spain/Portugal/western/southern France.** https://ionity.eu/ https://supercharge.info/map

Now yes there are many 3rd party chargers and a lot of 50 kw chargers, but 50 kw charging sounds downright miserable, and reliability is a bit spotty. Of course you can use them with Tesla too. 

The other factor is Tesla has extremely cheap rates compared to any other fast charging network in Europe, often 50% less. The difference can be significant, on the order of 7-15 euros per 100 miles or so. 

In America there is only electrify America as a real alternative which is extremely expensive and has mediocre reliability and coverage of less populous areas.

350 kw stations sound cool, but remember for electrify America that’s split between two chargers, and for ionity it’s not 350 kw for any car unless it’s 800V. Otherwise it’s 175 kw. That may or may not be an issue depending on what automakers do. Tesla certainly has more than one v3 in Europe so not sure where that’s coming from but it’s not accurate. Obviously coronavirus is slowing down all infrastructure projects currently.

Of course the biggest thing is having more cars that can charge at 150+ kw. As it stands, very few cars can charge at that speed.

Five cases of coronavirus have now been reported by the health ministry in Syria. The country is subject to a curfew from 6pm to 6am as of March 25. Syria braces itself for a potential medical crisis. 

The Syrian healthcare sector has been crippled under a “maximum pressure” economic sanctions campaign that has collectively punished the Syrian people for the duration of a war waged against them by the same governments inflicting the catastrophic economic damage. Hospitals and medical care centers have been targeted and occupied by the extremist armed groups throughout Syria, further reducing the Syrian state-ability to deal with the looming threat of an apparently rapacious pandemic. 

Sanctions increase the risk of pandemic spread
All measures taken against the Syrian government by the UK, US and EU are ostensibly to “protect” the Syrian people. Of course sanctions never protect the people, they deprive the people of basic needs, they decimate essential infrastructure. They are designed to weaken the target state or leadership, to turn the people against the government, to serve US-led foreign policy agendas in the region. Sanctions enable war and destruction, they are taken to bring resistant nations into line with horrifying consequences for the civilian population. 

Instead of lifting sanctions to allow nations like Iran and Syria to combat what is described as a “global pandemic” that threatens the lives of all Syrians and Iranians according to the media hype – the US-led coalition of “humanitarian” intervention is effectively doubling down on their pro-sanction, pro-war rhetoric, as a recent statement from the UK, US, France and Germany has demonstrated. Former UK Ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, described the statement as a thinly veiled cry of solidarity for Al-Qaeda in Syria, “There is not a word here with which Hayat Tahrir Ash Sham, the dominant jihadi group, would not concur.”

White Helmets weaponize Covid-19 to ensure Syrian people suffer more
The Al-Qaeda-linked White Helmets group have sprung into action to defend the sanctions regime and to effectively condemn the huge majority of Syrian people to further misery should the pandemic take hold in Syria. An organisation with a history of collaboration with the US Coalition-sponsored armed groups in Syria, itself funded by the same governments, has been triggered by the billionaire-manufactured PR complex that manages and directs this shadow state construct.

We have seen a flurry of activity on their Twitter accounts, their primary platform, promoting the White Helmet “coronavirus” campaign. This is nothing short of cynical exploitation of a world crisis to weaponize it against the Syrian government via an entity that has served this purpose since its establishment, in Turkey, by a former British military intelligence officer, James Le Mesurier. 

The White Helmets have published a statement calling for sanctions against Syria to be maintained. The statement is based on misinformation and duplicitous narratives including the claim that Syria and Russia are deliberately targeting hospitals, omitting that these hospitals are invariably taken over by the Al Qaeda-dominated armed groups in areas they control – converted into terrorist triage centers, prisons, courts, military centers and torture chambers. 

Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was recently given a platform in the Senate to “[feed] the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the talking points that it should adopt.” Saleh’s highly politicized speech is echoed in his tweet, instrumentalising the coronavirus crisis to further amplify the talking points historically and fraudulently used to criminalize the Syrian government while airbrushing Nusra Front/Al-Qaeda from the Syrian conflict landscape. 


White Helmets are neither neutral nor humanitarian
So, in summary, the White Helmets, a supposedly “neutral” “humanitarian” organisation are sustaining their donors “maximum pressure” campaign against the Syrian people they claim to support. If the White Helmets were anything other than an extremist, propaganda construct implementing the US Coalition “regime change” policy against Syria, they would have demanded a ban on sanctions to enable the country to collectively deal with the coronavirus crisis. 

The White Helmet organisation should be condemned for effectively enabling mass suffering and death in Syria, not only by providing cover for internationally designated terrorist groups, but, now, for endorsing sanctions that will ensure the perfect conditions for a global pandemic to spread like wildfire through a “hybrid warfare”-decimated nation.

No one thought that Canada would become  a nation that supported globalization and free trade after the first Trudeau. We eventually got politicians like Brian mulroney, Mike Harris, Preston Manning, and Stephen Harper. Now we are at a point where trudeau 2.0 supports free trade and is building pipelines for Alberta (however hesitantly). These would have been unthinkable positions 50 years ago. Politics can shift significantly. It takes time.

&gt;For not personally supporting infanticide, he was slandered. For not personally supporting the price movement, he was slandered

So was Harper. Scheer waffled, and ran what was the weakest campaign put forward by the federal conservative party. 

&gt;Social conservatism is dying in Canada, because the neoliberals SUPPRESS dissent

Most social conservatives in Canada are also very neoliberal economically; they support free trade, low tax and less regulation, and decentralization, giving more power to the provinces. Unlike the US, they recognize the need for some social services.

&gt;Extremist” politics of the left are commonplace in Canada.

Its not extremist compared to the US, europe, or most western democracies.

&gt;he was slandered

Welcome to politics. Do any work for political parties, even on a volunteer level, you'll get used to it. You need a thick skin.

&gt;because the neoliberals SUPPRESS dissent. They control the media. The schools. The narratives. They are in power indefinitely.

Neoliberal is not synonymous with progressive. Most social conservatives won't be onboard if you oppose free market policies. Progressive *social* narratives are common and will take decades to change. Canada has actually.moved right economically in the last 30 years.



&gt;I mean it is merely a neoliberal dictatorship, regardless of whether people recognize this or not.

Canada is the one of the oldest oldest continuous constitutional democracies in the world; number 4, I think. Just because you call it a dictatorship doesn't make it that.


Revolutionary political change fails in Canada every time. Think about the times any actual armed revolution occurred:

* upper and lower Canada rebellions in the 1840s
* Fenians
* Louis Riel 
* FLQ
* OKA crises

Riel wasnt arrested; John A Macdonald sent the police, army and cannons to deal with him. A ten man terrorist cell resulted in martial law and mass arrests of political opponents by Trudeau 1.0. The full.might of the state, backed by public support, was brought out, whenever rule of law was challenged.

&gt; Nicolas Jaar is a Chilean-American composer and recording artist based in New York. Nicolas Jaar was born the 10th of January 1990 in New York but spent most of his childhood in Santiago de Chile, only to return to his place of birth as a teenager. Haunted by Mulatu Astatke, Erik Satie, Ezekiel Honig and Villalobos’ “Thé au Harem d’Archimède”; Nico started to make organic electronic music in 2004 at the age of 14.

&gt; At 17, he debuted with ""The Student EP"" on Wolf + Lamb Music, with remixes by Seth Troxler and Kasper. At 18 he continued producing and played live at Club der Visionäre and Arena in Berlin, at the Marcy in Brooklyn and at Mutek in Mexico City, alongside Deadbeat, Flying Lotus and Guillaume &amp; the Coutu Dumonts, amongst others. At 19 he studied at Brown University in Rhode Island. Nico has many releases coming up, including some on Circus Company, Wolf + Lamb (with remixes by Ryan Crosson) and on his own label, Clown and Sunset, of which he is the owner and founder.

&gt; Jaar then spent four years in underground dance circles, crafting rough, hip hop influenced house music (examples include ""Love you gotta lose again"", ""Angles""). Initially made as jokes to make his mother laugh and dance, Jaar made two songs where he sang in his native Spanish (""Mi Mujer"" and ""El Bandido""). Jaar did not intend for them to come out. He changed his mind in 2010, as he felt the songs were his way of answering to what he deemed as exploitative sampling of Latin American culture by white European DJs.

&gt; He released his debut album, Space Is Only Noise, in January 2011 to critical acclaim, receiving a score of 8.4 and the title of Best New Music from Pitchfork [5] and four stars from the Guardian.[6] It was ranked #1 album of the year by Resident Advisor, Mixmag, and Crack Mag.

&gt; Jaar toured the album for three years with guitarist Dave Harrington (later of Darkside) and keyboardist Will Epstein. Jaar was voted # 1 Live Act on Resident Advisor for the 3 years he toured the record.[7]

&gt; In 2012, he debuted a live concept called From Scratch, where, in front of a live audience, he samples records he bought that day. The first iteration happened in Queens, NY at MOMA PS1; it was a 5-hour concert with collaborator Will Epstein, videographer Ryan Staake, dancer Lizzie Feidelson and singer Sasha Spielberg. He has also performed From Scratch at the Museum of Modern Art in Denver, Colorado and Montreal.

&gt; On May 18, 2012 Nicolas Jaar made his BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix' debut,[8] which was voted Radio 1's Essential Mix Of The Year of 2012.[9]

&gt; On October 4, 2013, the debut album from Darkside, Jaar's project with longtime collaborator Dave Harrington, was released to critical acclaim and a 9.0 score on Pitchfork.[10] The band toured the record for the entirety of 2014.[11]

&gt; In February 2015, Jaar released a largely ambient record entitled Pomegranates, which he intended as an alternate soundtrack to The Color of Pomegranates.[12][13]

&gt; Later that year, Jaar scored the soundtrack to Dheepan, a thriller by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard about a family of Sri Lankan refugees living in the suburbs of Paris. It was the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2015.[2]

&gt; Jaar is the owner and founder of the New York-based imprint Other People. Notable releases include works by Lydia Lunch, DJ Slugo, William Basinski, Valentin Stip, VTGNIKE, Lucretia Dalt and 12z. Although the label predominantly releases vinyl, it also offers a membership where fans can download new releases and gain access to the entire Other People archive for $4 a month. Other People only publishes creator-owned content and splits all profits made from records sales 50/50 with artists. Read more on Last.fm.

I may be wrong, but I think part of why you see this topic differently than most is because, as an Italian, you thankfully come from a country that wasn't heavily involved in post-Enlightenment era slave trading. My goal today is both to differentiate that form of the slave trade from other slave economies that predated it, to explain how racism played a part in its operation, and to discuss how white Europeans were ultimately responsible for driving this trade. 

&gt; Slavery is a basic result of human interaction, is embedded in our innate social strategy...

What you're saying is unfortunately broadly true, as slavery has existed throughout human history, and continues to exist today. However, what's important to consider is how the Trans-Atlantic slave trade (TAST) differed from forms of slavery that preceded it. This institution existed on a scale, and involved a level of brutality and dehumanization, that simply is not matched anywhere else in history. This type of chattel slavery, which treated people as animals and gave slaves no viable route towards freedom, led directly to the torture, rape, and murder of hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions. As much as it might have sucked to be a slave in a place like the Roman Empire, your standard of living, legal protections, and prospects for the future would have been drastically higher than that of a slave in the US or the Caribbean. Making matters worse the TAST was also multi-generational, with the children of slaves also being taken into slavery. This not only increased the numbers of people being impacted by this system, but also created a need for new social systems to justify the continued enslavement, which we'll get to in a second. 

&gt;  ...it's also idiotic to think of slavery as a racist phenomenon and not an economical/social consequence of the structure of the country its established in.

I'll focus on the American South for this part of the discussion, as it's the region I know most about. While you're right that the motivations for slavery were in large part economic, racism played a huge role in allowing this system to survive, and at times outweighed other concerns. To understand why this is the case, we need to first understand that contrary to what many people might understandably think, racism against black people was not why white Europeans took them as slaves, [but instead developed *after* these people were already being enslaved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Legacy_of_racism). Some early justifications for multi-generational enslavement, like religious and cultural differences, lost their usefulness as the decedents of slaves largely converted to Christianity and began to share the general culture of the people who enslaved them. The rise of racism, and the notion of white racial superiority, became the social tool needed to justify the preservation of the chattel slavery system. Moreover, racism became critical for maintaining the cohesion of slave holding societies, like the American South. The presence of a large slave labor force was actually economically devastating for the majority of white southerners, many of whom were relatively poor as the result of either being forced to economically compete with large slave plantations, or because the only work they could find was assisting on these plantations. Slavery in the US really only directly benefited a small minority of hyper wealthy white slave owners. However, racism provided a social incentive that prevented poor white Americans from trying to dismantle American slavery, despite its existence being to their clear disadvantage. So long as whites were viewed as inherently superior, even the poorest white farmer was given a spot in the social hierarchy above black Americans, and thus they supported slavery, even as it lowered their quality of life. 

The tricky part about this racism, is that at a certain point it stopped being a justification for an economic need, and instead became a freestanding monstrous force. Again looking at the American South, as the industrial revolution began sweeping through the US, Northern American manufacturing economies began to significantly outpace the Southern agrarian slave economy. While cotton growing was still profitable, it would have made sense for the South's economy to make a significant pivot towards industrial production, but it didn't. Giving up the plantation system for industrial plants would have required giving the majority of black slaves more advanced vocational training, at least a limited education, and having them work alongside white laborers as relative equals, all of which went expressly against the South's social system of white supremacy. Moreover, poor white southerners did not push for industrial jobs, despite these possibly being a route towards greater wealth, in part because doing so might have jeopardized their social standing in comparison to black slaves. Economic progress was delayed as a fairly direct result of the slave system and the racism used to perpetuate it. This problem jumped into even sharper relief during the Civil War, when poor white southerns voluntarily fought and died in the thousands to defend slavery in their states, again despite the fact that slavery economically disadvantaged them.            

&gt; Most slave trader outside the us were black , most of the times specific tribes that used the population of nearby territories to use as products to trade with the more developed states since they had no economical product actually competitive with the foreign markets.

I want to try to deconstruct two parts of this view, as I think most people in the US and Europe aren't given a full picture in their schooling of just how dramatically the TAST changed West Africa. Before the slave trade, West Africa was dotted with numerous kingdoms that were wealthy, fairly politically stable, and at the very least self sufficient, if not actively engaged in productive trade. Slavery was a part of this region's economy, but its use was limited, came with legal protections for slaves, and slaves were usually able to earn their freedom in the span of several years. When Europeans began arriving on the West African coast, they were looking for slaves not because the West Africans had nothing else to trade, but because the European powers were facing an absolutely crushing labor shortage in their colonies in the Americas. Native American peoples were dying too quickly to be used as slaves, and European settlers couldn't be enticed to take on physically brutal plantation and mine work. As a result, Europeans were suddenly willing to pay a very high price, and trade highly valuable goods, for human cargo. This sudden economic incentive sparked a cycle that would begin shredding West Africa. 

With the new demand for slaves, Europeans were now willing to trade firearms and gunpowder to African kingdoms that participated in the TAST, which had not been widely made available before. These newly armed kingdoms used their acquired military might to take over their neighbors, thus gaining new slaves that could be traded for further weapons. This rapidly plunged West Africa into a perverse arms race, in which every kingdom needed to engage in the slave trade to obtain the weapons required for their defense, lest they be defeated and enslaved themselves. Hyper-militarized kingdoms sprung up, with economies centered on trading slaves for arms, and ripped through other societies, many of which had existed for centuries. As war became commonplace and a significant part of the population was enslaved, the local economies of West Africa were absolutely devastated. It became extremely difficult to maintain even basic agricultural production under the constant threat of being kidnapped by slavers during a raid. Making matters worse, the TAST led to a huge loss of population in West Africa, with entire regions being stripped of their working age population. The situation was so bad that West Africa's population stagnated during the TAST, and only began to increase again once the trade ended. 

White Europeans benefited from, drove demand for, and at times exacerbated the intensity of slave trading in West Africa. Without their influence, we have little reason to believe that slavery in this region would have grown into the terrifying economic and political force it became. Moreover, it's not as though the Europeans were ignorant of the damage they were causing. African rulers repeatedly reached out to their European compatriots, both to request they cease using slaves in ways that broke the laws of their kingdoms, and later to express the absolute devastation being driven by the slave trade. Many of the European powers had a had at least some understanding of the consequences created by their desire for slaves, but often justified the continuation of the TAST through the use of racism. If the allowed themselves to believe that they were inherently racially superior, it created a permission structure to completely forego normal diplomacy with the kingdoms of West Africa, as engaging in slave trading became their perceived right as a ""superior race"".

What about ALL mass shootings, and what about compared to other countries (taking into account population differences of course). Also what time period is that in?

Sorry for the late reply. Ok let's see some of this wall of text piece by piece. According to WaPo, about 1200 Americans have died in all public mass shootings since 1950 TOTAL. To compare, around 2500 Americans drown each year. Let me know if you need me to find the WaPo article. Compared to other countries per capita, our mass shootings are not extraordinary at all:

[https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-us-leads-the-world-in-mass-shootings/](https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-us-leads-the-world-in-mass-shootings/)

It gets even better for the US when you don't just count mass shootings, but mass killings generally, because then you have to include things like the European truck attacks.

&gt;Defensive gun use per year? Maybe that’s the statistic. Doesn’t take into account whether a gun was necessary, just whether it was used, and also doesn’t take into account times in which with stricter gun control the situation would not have occurred in the first place

But again, we've added millions more guns since 1990, but homicide has fallen by 50%. So you're basic theory that more guns = more crime totally falls apart. I'm not saying I have definitive proof that more guns = less crime, I do not. But the whole premise of the gun control movement is that when guns are plentiful, crime rises. Well, we've added literally tens of millions of guns since 1990, but our crime rates are at historic lows.

&gt;Accidental gun deaths below 500 a year? That’s 500 people first of all, and if the other statistics are questionable as a defence then what did those 500 people every year die for? And again, compare those rates to other countries.

Accidental deaths under 500 a year is incredible considering we have over 100 million gun owners. What other outdoorsy activities have accident rates that low? Think of all the things you could ban that would save lives, using your logic. For example, vehicle offroading kills about 600 people per year, even though far less people do that activity than own guns.  [https://www.rhllaw.com/2016/05/26/6-staggering-statistics-about-off-road-vehicle-a/](https://www.rhllaw.com/2016/05/26/6-staggering-statistics-about-off-road-vehicle-a/)

&gt;But also can we just backtrack a second how many of the people who are shot in self defence die?

You are barking up the wrong tree with this. If it is legitimate self defense, i.e. someone's life was in danger through no fault of their own, then I'm glad that scumbag they had to kill is dead. It means they can't try and hurt anyone else.

&gt;Also, % of population and gun users for everything? What are they. How do I put it into perspective? Numbers mean absolutely nothing unless they are put in context and compared to others.

Polls consistently show 30-40% of Americans report that they own a gun. How many lie to pollsters is unknown.

&gt;Similarly I posted this not because I think people should have the horribly lax access to guns they currently do in America, but because they should know that a government is supposed to serve them and they should do something if it does not and they should not be afraid to do so. Perhaps that was the original purpose behind the second amendment, but time has both passed and changed and it does not serve that purpose in modern society.

And how the hell do you propose forcing a tyrannical government back into compliance with its people without guns? While there have been some bloodless revolutions, they are the exception, not the rule. Venezuela banned guns in 2013, and now only Maduro's thugs have them. Hong Kong is also beaten into submission because they can't shoot back. You literally posted about killing everyone in charge when those in charge abuse democracy, but then started screaming foul when people rightly pointed out that requires an armed populace.

&gt;Again, you are holding on to the illusion of freedom, when the actual picture is horrifying to anyone not brainwashed by your society and I’m sorry you cannot see it.

I have a safe full of guns, have for years, as my father did before me, and we have never hurt ourselves nor anyone else other than some birds in hunting, and some paper and clay targets for recreation.

He wanted to keep her from dying, not being her back from the dead...  which is exactly what Rey did to Kylo (who had a life threatening injury), and she didn’t die.

If such cloaking tech existed on the transports, then why wasn’t it used on other ships; or at least a variant that would prevent tracking.  They had enough “fuel” for another hyperspace jump, so why not prevent the tracking and then jump.  Her plan leads to more plot holes.

Plus, how would Poe’s mutiny ruin Holdo’s cloaking plan?  As if the mutiny suddenly prevented the transport ships’ ability to cloak?

Plus plus...  if Holdo had merely informed Poe of the plan in the first place instead of being vindictive over Poe’s attack, the mutiny wouldn’t have happened.  It’s simple... “Here’s the plan Poe.

Yes they did.  Lucasfilm didn’t abolish Legends entirely until it was owned by Disney.  My point with it is that Lucas respected the EU and allowed it to thrive.  As soon as Disney took over, it was abolished.  Borrowing from the EU to defend Disney is like using Dragonball GT feats to defend things in DBZ.

The reason people have no problems with EU things being adopted under Lucas is the same reason people don’t mind Toriyama adopting EU things in Dragonball.  They are the original creators.  Lucas also used aspects from the EU in planned out stories.  Disney has used them as bandaids for poor writing and severe lack of planning.  People also don’t have problems with powers in the EU because most the EU creators have a lot of respect for Star Wars and don’t trample on it’s legacy for money...  unlike Disney.

2) [What was the national socialist german workers party in the beginning?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f37wtl/what_was_the_national_socialist_german_workers/)

3) [Ideological factions in the NSDAP?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/en2w9p/ideological_factions_in_the_nsdap/)

I have a keen academic and personal interest in National Socialism and 20th century politics in general, though I have a much wider breadth of knowledge in National Socialism than the latter. I also feel it is necessary to disclaim explicitly that I am not a National Socialist in any way.

I believe this qualifies me for the general ""European History"" or perhaps ""Military History"" categories and would like my specific flair to say ""National Socialism | German History 1918 - 1945"".

I hope that you will consider me for flair! If I do not yet meet your criteria, please just let me know what else I can do. I look forward to offering more contributions!

Cheers,

 WHO, the Surgeon General,  American Medical association and their EU equivalents,  aren't doing this because of random fake Chinese statistics (which btw the data from before the lock down is recognized as fake by the WHO as well so you're just comparing fake data against other fake data...).

There's an entire field of study related to it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology

That's the whole goal.   If your local hospital can only treat 100 people and you have 500 susceptible people in your area (just low easy numbers to make a point realistically cities have tens of thousands of susceptible people) the hope is a quarantine will slow it so instead of 170 sick people requiring beds in the first weeks you slow it so your hospital can meet demands.  Because it's been shown time and time again that *emergency triage* have way higher fatality rates then a well operated hospital.

“But experts say exemptions on paper alone are not effective. The broad designations on Iranian banks and companies have made any form of trade with Iran risky and complicated for international companies.”

Which clearly means that, like I said, sanctions make it harder for Iran to buy medical supplies. But it is a by-product, not the function. This is because companies don’t want to go through the special channels that are available if they are unfamiliar with those channels and financial institutions see it as more trouble than its worth. 

Personally, I’m for lifting sanctions until the pandemic is over. But I’m not naive enough to think that Iran is using this pandemic to try and leverage the situation to get the sanctions lifted and as soon as they are lifted they are going to use that time to do whatever the can to strengthen their regime.

trap music meets trapezoids i think might be saying the same thing as dots and lines. geometry = shapes like a trapezoid, makes up the natural laws that we live by. geometry is based off of lines to make those shapes, like a rappers lyrics aka LINES make up the worlds and things they create/promote/glorify etc etc...  So a rapper with lyrics and meaning behind their songs vs dumb trap mumble lazy rap bars.  So if trap music meets geometry, or if trap music and geometry meet you/your ear, do you pretend to give up/not enjoy the trap music anymore even though deep down some dumb trap shit is what you wanna listen to? Is trap music a form of ""sacred geometry"" itself?  Does trap music need to die or evolve?

Not sure exactly what he is trying to hit here but i think its something around these questions, especially since the actual song breaks down to have the trap type beat towards the end paired with the jazz music.  So is lupe himself trying to bridge that gap with this song, or his music as a whole, or is he saying that someone should do it, and combine what he brings with his lyricism and put it over trap beats so that maybe someone who has a bigger audience than lupe can ""save the children"".

If it's not practical, what exactly does that prove? Regarding taming zebras, first of all, eagles are not zebras. There are a handful of examples where people were able to put zebras to work. But these are rare, and only happened when Europeans came who were already on horseback, and thus could catch them in the first place. So to domesticate this creature, you first need to have already domesticated s rideable creature. [Here's the article on found on it](https://thomsonsafaris.com/blog/taming-zebras-domestication-attempts/). 

Regarding Hyenas and foxes, animals needed to be useful to humans for humans to want to domesticate them. Wolves started hanging around people to eat their scraps, and started defacto guarding them, and moved on to help people hunt.  Hyenas are scavengers because they're shitty hunters. They move in after a hunting animal has left, or chase away a cheetah or leopard from it's kill.  They're ill equipped to take down gazelle or wildebeests. 

Foxes are lone hunters, so they don't know how to work in groups, and because they're  small, any prey that a they can kill isn't going to feed your tribe. A possible use would be pest control, but cats were the popular choice because African wild cats(from whom house cats are descended) instinctually bury their waste. It's why cats use litter boxes and dogs don't.  Foxes were only recently domesticated at a Russian fur farm, and it was only possible because they were going through hundreds or thousands of foxes a year.

Trudeau's administration under-estimated the spread of this virus back in January. There were people back in January who were arguing that travel bans to control the spread of this virus was racist. Meanwhile our government backtracked and decided to do it anyway mid-March. In a very connected world with lots of airline travel like we have now, a virus with a R0 of 2-2.5 is inevitably going to spread worldwide if you don't restrict international travel.

My order of preference would be United Biz 100k, then IHG, then Bonvoy.

Reasoning: 

* Under the current award chart, the United 100k is worth 1.5 one-way partner J trips to the EU. Cheapest you could reasonably get away with that paying real money is $1200, likely much higher ($3k+ for some partner airlines like Swiss). And if you fly United with any regularity, the card is effectively free ($95 AF minus $100 credit for booking 7+ United flights). Note that this is the offer ending tomorrow, not Bonvoy (that one ends 4/8).

* IHG is an all-time high offer that's basically worth about 2 free nights at top-of-the-top IHG hotels, or lots more at cheaper ones. The annual free night for $89 makes it a likely long-term keeper too.

* Marriott 100k can take you a good ways, especially in Thailand/Indonesia. The offer just isn't as impressive relatively speaking. They've had 125k offers in the past and the Chase Marriott ($95 AF instead of $450) was just at 100k a couple months ago. If you're comparing number of nights, this is just 1 to 1.5 nights (depending on peak/off peak) at top-of-the-top hotels.

The reason the west has messed with Iran for near 100y while befriending the saudis is very simple: mitigation of viable threat. 

Iran’s leaders and many of her people profoundly want one thing more than any other: to remake Persia that was. That land is now occupied by Iraq, Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. And Iran if left alone is potentially powerful enough to do just that. If not now then within a decade of re-emerging as a free trade partner. 

Whereas comparatively the saudis lived in tents before oil money: comparatively they have proven to present an infinitesimal threat compared to what Iran would and could do with equivalent power, money and freedom. 

Add to this the fact that many Iranians are deeply racist not just towards afghanis (who are genetically indifferent) but also towards Arabs - who they really look down upon - and especially towards black people - who many Iranians view literally as subhuman. It was no coincidence that Hitler held many top level meetings in Iran leading up to the war. He also gifted the-then ruler an entire propaganda library purporting to prove the superiority of the Aryan race. Lest we forget - Iranians are also Aryan - not Arab. Iranians seeded parts of Europe, long ago. 

Thus there is also the threat of Iran wishing to literally overtake the entire Middle East. And it is a viable threat, given enough power, money and freedom to operate. 

This is why America and Europe have always treated Iran so harshly. It is deserved. As for the 1979 Rev - EUR/US were played and fooled. Khomeini was in exile in France at the time. He saw his chance, told the western powers what they needed to hear, then immediately told them to take a hike the moment he stole power. He murdered most of the people who started that revolution. A revolution within a revolution. 

My point is - there are no good guys in this conflict. Both sides deserve real blame and judgement. But it’s the innocent Iranian people who suffer. 

The ideal outcome - fantasy at this point - is a return to pre-Rev freedoms but within a democratic context. Most Iranians desperately want to live a western lifestyle. Islam never really took root in most of Iran, especially the cosmopolitan areas. Just look at pics of life there before the Rev. The ideal outcome, in a nutshell, is for travel to Iran to feel exactly like travel to eg France/Canada. You can say what you want, criticise who you want, worship what you want (if at all), wear what you want and experience zero legal discrimination based on religion or gender or any other protected class. 

If/when Iran does regain her freedom, she will have to wrestle with her toxic, racist but widespread views because they will be fundamentally unpalatable to the civilised world. But one problem at a time. Right now, the IR holds the people literally hostage. That must be resolved first. 

Only the west can help bring this fantasy into reality. But it must be internally incepted and internally mediated. The west’s help, insofar as it is beneficial, is to keep on weakening the regime. Obama handed the regime a golden ticket with his deal, and in doing so showed his utter lack of understanding of what the regime truly is and wants. He made things far, far worse in my opinion. 

Say what you will of trump. I certainly won’t celebrate him. But he truly does understand what the regime are and treats them exactly as they deserve to be treated. He is the best president - from the perspective of the average Iranian - to come around for a long, **long** time. But of course to say this in Iran will literally get you killed, because speaking Truth in Iran will get you killed. That is the regime in its most honest manifestation. 

So please do some reading before internalising your leftist western propaganda. What you wrote does not relate to any strategy that can help Iranian people. It is at best ignorant virtue signalling and leftist-ideological possession. Neither left nor right wing policies alone can save or even help Iran. A balanced mix of both will be necessary in any event.

Tencent is suffering from a shrinking player base - just look at the EU server, which hardly contains any Europeans anymore, but some 90% Arabs of which a staggering number are using hacks.

All Tencent can do is to ban users, and 5 minutes later the hacker is back with a new name.

New hacks are coming out with every update, and they get better at avoiding detection every time.

This will eventually kill the game - and thus the revenue stream for Tencent.

I am pretty sure, that they would LOVE to get an instrument to make a clean game. Which is better for business - having a number of hackers that scare away the majority of players, or losing those guys and preserving a massive player base?

&gt; French (le français [lə fʁɑ̃sɛ] ( listen) or la langue française [la lɑ̃ɡ fʁɑ̃sɛz]) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted.

Now to top it all off Siam in the south decides they want a piece of me too and heads right for my capital, Rome. So I’m now fighting the 3 front war I didn’t want.

Trump called it fake news and a Democratic hoax, he says he won't return calls to governors that don't sufficiently kow-tow, he said a week ago he wants the country open and churches filled by Easter despite all modelling and all other countries' experiences contradicting that.

If you don't think he's a liar then I don't see how you couldn't think he's at least willingly saying untruths or contradicting experts on a whim simply because he thinks it sounds good for his re-election prospects (or whatever, as you say the motivations aren't particularly important). At the most charitable, he's just the biggest sufferer of the Dunning-Kruger effect US politics has ever seen.

If you believe he's a master thinker then missteps like suggesting in his national address that cargo from Europe would also be subject to bans, which created huge impacts to the stock market are difficult to find a place in your narrative.

It can't be a lack of access to resources, he's the POTUS. So is he either mentally incapable of processing what he's been told... or is he intentionally choosing to not convey it or take the actions that logically follow (which I would personally call lying).

I'm not commenting on what kind of person he is, but I don't think you can dismiss his motivations when in the same breath you're making assumptions of others. When I see that interview I see a reporter asking for accountability for a statement. If he's not going to ask that question, who is? If no one does, then sounds awfully like behaviour of Soviet/Chinese/North Korean/choose your favourite dictatorship in terms of controlling the media.

I get the frustrations with the established two-party system, but Trump has only served to further entrench this, by forcing people to extremes. It's my feeling, anecdotal evidence only though, that people are now gravitating to Biden, as they did with Clinton, simply because they see them as the higher probability option, and they're desperate to stop what they see as extremist positions in Trump. 

This I believe is a natural progression because Dems have needed to be not too far left of Republican stances historically to give greater chances of winning. This is also why Dems of 2020 are now to the right of Nixon from 50 years ago.

You state you don't like being lied to, so can you tell me who is lying to you here in these DC power structures you refer to, and how it's not the guy saying it's a hoax, then just a flu, then that people will be in churches by Easter?

Modifying personal behaviour, be it through social distancing, or hygiene or treatment of symptoms has been shown as the most effective - indeed the only - tool against the coronavirus. If Trump was told of this, which he probably was in January, but definitely was in February, then surely the effectiveness of these are a function of how the President communicates that to the nation. By downplaying it, instead of controlling it as was seen in many other countries, the US now has more than double the next greatest number of cases worldwide, and third most deaths. 

So why is it not reasonable, in your view, to question why he downplayed it as just a flu when worldwide evidence showed the contrary? Why shouldn't he take responsibility for the excess deaths that will result?

I could accept that he decided that economics were more important and to ignore evidence and recommendations in the hope a miracle would occur, or even, if you like a conspiracy theory, because he wanted things to get really bad because then he can use this to change national policies on a whim to his own ends (look to Hungary, which is now ruled by decree, if you think that's absurd).

I mean that even sign language morphemes that are visually motivated retain a degree of arbitrariness, in line with Saussure's arbitrariness of the sign. While KSL, BSL, and ASL signs for Egypt are all visually motivated, what exactly the three languages choose to focus on is completely arbitrary. This is seen in large parts of sign language lexicons. For example:

[ASL ""COFFEE""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=415): Visually motivated by grinding coffee bins

[BSL ""COFFEE""](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/coffee): Visually motivated by drinking a cup of coffee

Or

[ASL ""CAT""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=334): Visually motivated by whiskers

[KSL ""CAT""](http://sldict.korean.go.kr/front/sign/signContentsView.do?origin_no=7524&amp;top_category=CTE&amp;category=&amp;searchKeyword=%EA%B3%A0%EC%96%91%EC%9D%B4&amp;searchCondition=&amp;search_gubun=&amp;museum_type=00&amp;current_pos_index=0): Visually motivated by cats licking paws

This arbitrariness leads to [ASL ""HORSE""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=1057) and [BSL ""RABBIT""](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/rabbit) being signed exactly the same, because both are visually motivated by ears. Obviously, a BSL monoglot would be unable to intuit ASL ""HORSE.""

In fact, sign language iconicity can be arbitrary even when motivated by the same object, e.g. see [the example of ""TREE.""](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin_Thompson4/publication/24187244/figure/fig2/AS:341483514286080@1458427422044/The-sign-for-TREE-in-three-different-signed-languages-From-The-Signs-of-Language-p-21.png)

&gt;  And where are you getting that evidence from?

There have been surveys of iconicity across sign languages. In ""Iconicity and Transparency in Sign Languages: A Cross-Linguistic Cross-Cultural View,"" Pizzuto and Volterra showed twenty transparent and twenty non-transparent and [LIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Sign_Language) words to thirty-six Deaf people from six Western European countries.

Most of the non-transparent words were also visually motivated, e.g. LIS ""MUSEUM"" (shape of a rectangular building, like [the ASL cognate](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=4446)) or ""MIRROR"" (surface in front of face, see [ASL cognate](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=1393)). The transparent ones were along the lines of LIS ""HEAR,"" which involves tapping the ear, or LIS ""HUNGER,"" which involves tapping the stomach.

The [results](https://i.imgur.com/m9mrUfi.png) were that while the majority of Deaf participants correctly guessed fourteen of the twenty transparent words, they understood only three of the nontransparent ones. So there are clear limits on iconicity, especially for concepts as abstract as country names where a transparent representation is functionally impossible.

&gt; Think critically, if Jews are matrilineally descended, then obviously there would be interracial marriages, and race mixing as well. After all, the Jewish ethnic divisions exist, and that's a fact. You don't think critically, when things are obvious. Just like my fourth source, the Jewish law, Halakha, which can be from Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite, Ethiopians, and other Jewish communities.

Now read what I wrote:

&gt; When one refers to the Jewish “race”, they are referring to the amalgamation of matrilineally descended Jewish subpopulations which have interbred (to an extend) within the populations of gentiles in the societies in which they are living in.

What you wrote:

&gt; then obviously there would be interracial marriages, and race mixing as well

Yes. Are you saying that I am denying this? 

What I wrote:

&gt; which have **interbred** (to an extend) within the populations of gentiles in the societies in which they are living in

What you are trying to delineate as separate ethnic groups among Jews are actually just subgroups of the Jewish ethnicity. These subgroups are a result of interbred Jews retaining some genetic component of the ethnic group they interbred with. You prove this in your response above:

&gt; You don't believe that female Jews can marry other people of other ethnicity?? The Jewish Ethnic Divisions[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18733/) exist.

Do you even know what you cited? I suspect you are randomly linking verbose studies thinking that I won't be able to understand them, when in reality you are the one that is unaware. Let's pull a quote directly from the article:

&gt; Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.

Did you even read this far? What would this imply? Hmm. It's quite clear that Jews, despite having interbred with separate populations, still retain some form of genetic similarity, meaning that they would have been descended from a common ancestral group. Looking more like an ethnicity to me.

&gt; Second, despite their high degree of geographic dispersion, Jewish populations from Europe, North Africa, and the Near East were less diverged genetically from each other than any other group of populations in this study

What does this imply? Ethnicities are defined by their relative genetic similarity, meaning that they wouldn't have significantly genetically divergent populations within them. Basic logic.


Anthropologists determine human ethnic groups and subgroups through the use of best fit genetic clusters. They do this by compiling and comparing the variation in genetic loci among populations (how specific gene markers differ among populations). Let's take a look at the [genetic variation among human geographical populations](https://pjt111.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/li09pca.jpg?w=630). As you can see, there is a significant and quantifiable genetic variation among separate geographical and ethnic populations. This information has been replicated thousands of times and is commonly accepted knowledge among all genetic scientists. Now, let's take a look at the [genetic variation among Jewish populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=3297573_pgen.1002559.g001.jpg) (source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297573/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297573/) ). The distribution of the genetic variation among these Jewish subgroups is similar to the genetic variation between [Finnish and Swedish subpopulations](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PCA_of_Sweden_and_Finland.png), for example. Why do we consider Swedes to be an ethnic group, even though they have an ingroup genetic variation similar to that of Jews, who you claim are not a single ethnicity? Of course there will be some genetic variation among Ashkenazis and Sephardics, but they are genetically similar enough to be considered a single ethnicity. Just as the genetic variation between Swedish subpopulations is marginal enough to render them to be a single ethnicity.


&gt; The source is an article from UK, which shows discrimination against colored people. Does that mean the UK is an ethnostate for white Europeans?

What are you even trying to say here? White is a race, and there are different, **distinct** ethnic groups residing within the UK. Ethnicity is not race, therefore this wouldn't be an ethnostate.

Eventually, a Syrian National Congress was convened in Damascus, and the Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed, with Faisal I as King. Despite this, the French had other plans, and began to prepare for an invasion to secure Syria as the newest addition to their empire. Despite the numerical and technological advantage of the French, a defiant Faisal I refused to surrender, and mustered his forces for a battle in Maysalun. Using the terrain to their advantage, the forces of the young kingdom achieved a narrow victory, forces the French army to fall back. While this battle proved a huge moral victory for the Kingdom, what ultimately saved the Kingdom was disaster on the Western Front. With the collapse of the Front into open revolution, the French were forced to withdraw to defend their nation from the International Red Army. British forces too would soon be forced to withdraw to deal with the revolutions in Europe and North America, and following the Egyptian Revolution, the British garrisons were forcibly expelled from Egypt, allowing Syrian troops to march south and unite Greater Syria.

Aliás por vezes nem consigo apreciar o que gosto por causa disso. Por exemplo chegas a casa queres estar com a tua mulher (no meu caso) ver um filme jogar um jogo ouvir uma musica, uma coisa que gostas de fazer , mas o facto de teres aqueles pensamentos em loop na cabeça não te deixam tirar partido do que estás a fazer e acabas por não ter prazer nenhum, são esses pensamentos de fundo que se dissipam e ajuda-me a estar ali presente a fazer o que gosto quando quero e a retirar muito mais prazer da actividade. Não é bem não pensar em nada é mais remover aqueles resíduos que não te interessam.

por isso é que faço as tais caminhadas e tenho os meus momentos dedicados a introspecção, é mesmo para organizar a cabeça, para nao me tirar foco ou apreciamento desses momentos, onde passas tempo com namorada, no teu caso mulher, ou a ver filmes, que provavelmente é a coisa que mais gosto de fazer, entre outras coisas. para ser sincero eu também nao sou gajo de stressar facilmente portanto também facilita as coisas ,sou chill por natureza.

Your question about ""what is a reasonable amount of money for someone who is rich to pay in taxes"" is really interesting.  I mean, Europe (recently) and the USA (in the 1950s) tried a 90% income tax bracket for extreme income levels and it doesn't work.  People find creative ways to shelter their money or just stop working.  If you squeeze rich people too hard they move or cheat.

I am not in favor of a wealth tax (like Warren or Sanders apparently wanted) because I don't think it's fair or practical.  If someone already earned the money it shouldn't erode over time and I suspect rich people will find a way around any wealth tax (or even just leave to avoid it).

I think that one way forward might be to double down on the inheritance tax.  I know there are kinds of special cases but a reasonable contract between society and an individual might be something like: ""If you make billions of dollars by selling a successful company, etc... then so be it.  Great for you.  We're going to tax you at a regular income rate when you make the money and we're going to prevent you from giving billions to your progeny.""  If you think about it, in essence this prevents the establishment of a de facto aristocracy.  It also solves the problem I started ranting about before -- the fact that too much money is being concentrated in the hands of too few people.

That problem will solve itself, in the long run, if unchecked.  It's really up to the rich people whether this happens peacefully or not.  One essay I read about this topic that I thought was interesting was Ray Dalio's ""[Why and How Capitalism Needs to be Reformed](https://economicprinciples.org/Why-and-How-Capitalism-Needs-To-Be-Reformed/)"".  If you're not familiar with the author, he's a hedge fund self-made billionaire and his thesis is basically that there's too much money concentration and that we don't invest enough in the next generation.

To answer your question directly around how much income is reasonable for the state to take from well-paid individuals, I think we could increase the current top federal tax bracket a bit.  It's 37% for married people on dollars earned past 612k.  Your 48% probably factors in things like state income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc...  But what I think is more important than where the federal ordinary income tax bracket boundaries are is to fill in all the loopholes.  e.g. qualified dividends pay no income tax up to like $110k and then a flat 15% thereafter.  Long term capital gains are also taxed at a rate way below ordinary income.  So people with jobs making money by spending time working a good job get taxed at 30%+ but people who invest money and live off dividends enjoy rates less than 15%.  How is that fair?

That said, I know that ~50% of Americans pay a zero effective tax rate.  That's not fair either -- people should have a stake in the system if they want a vote.  So I'd be all in favor of charging everyone who makes some income a small amount of tax.  It's their contribution to society.

Anyway, I just think that if we as a society did a better job extracting money from rich people we would not have to run so much QE to create new money (and use it to buy more newly issued federal debt beyond the 22 trillion dollars we and our children and their children already owe) to stimulate the economy.",True,False,False,,,0,1585797041,,1585797729,0,{},fm6lsjn,False,t3_fsq0i5,False,True,t1_fm657vv,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsq0i5/you_shouldnt_have_to_pay_taxes_on_land_you_own/fm6lsjn/,False,,1592857149,1,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,,0,[],

The general public tends to be idiots, and our health officials told us masks don't work to prevent hoarding.

The advice is now slowly starting to change, but they still aren't being truthful. 

Not only do mask provide some protection to the wearer, the greater benefit of mandatory masks, is for everyone else. It prevents the droplets that can spread from coughing, sneezing and even just talking. Reducing the risk of contaminated surfaces and breathing in the droplets.

These droplets can linger in the air for over 30 minutes, you don't even need to be in the same room as someone, for them to infect you. All you need to do is walk past where they were even minutes after they coughed or sneezed for them to infect you. The only way to prevent this is through everyone wearing masks.

Just like what countries that have their outbreak under control mandate everyone wear, which you have entirely ignored twice now.

Literally any mask is better than nothing, and there is no logical scenario where they increase risk. Even if someone infects themselves through improperly disposing of it, then they would have been infected anyways, because that means droplets landed on their mask, which otherwise would have been directly inhaled if they were not wearing a mask.

So yes, it is just as simple as masks work. And we have clear evidence of that from countries who've controlled their outbreaks.

A: **The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks.** This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth.

If you're going for just the scenery, Switzerland is Amazing but there's not lot else to recommend it. I ended up just driving through it and stopping to take pics but moved on. I much preferred Austria. 

I suppose I prefer places that are more off the beaten path. I nixed a well-planned trip to Great Britain (or at least Ireland/Scotland/Wales) for Iceland, and I don't regret it one bit. And I went to Slovenia instead of Croatia, which has become ridiculously expensive since the GOT phenom. It was an amazing trip, btw. Slovenia is still my favorite--the people are all so nice and welcoming of tourists (unlike France), the scenery is beyond beautiful, the rafting and whitewater kayaking on the Soča were world class and it cost a quarter of what it would have if I'd gone to Croatia. The Pot Miru (walk of peace) is amazing, and a real eye opener, if you like history and you're up for a good hike. If asked, my first recommendation will always be Slovenia, hands down, no contest, no hesitation. IMPO, there's no better place to go. 

If you can afford it (as it's just plain expensive to go at all), and you want cold weather, I suggest Iceland--even in July I was freezing (lol). But go outside the capital up the coast. Iceland is very travel friendly without renting a car with bus services from the airport to all the towns on the coasts. Also, hit the AirBnB spots every chance you get no matter where you go. Unlike the U.S, they're very nice in Europe and very cost economical. 

In any case, I tend to travel on a tight budget just because I'm a cheapskate and I go for the ""experience"" rather than the tourist hot spots. I didn't even go near the Blue Lagoon in Iceland--too touristy.

The club’s imports featured a FIFA World Cup winner, the husband of a German pop star, a Flamengo Brazilian Serie A legend, a Jose Mourinho student at Chelsea and a current Spanish La Liga sensation.
Former China international Shengqin Qu was the first import to make his debut for the Reds in a round four clash against Perth Glory. away.

He scored the winner on debut.
Qu was also the club’s very first marquee signing. 
However, South America was still hot for Adelaide when Argentine Marcos Flores was captured, while the Netherlands was also in vogue after former boss Aurelio Vidmar first signed Indonesian Dutch-born international goal machine Serginho van Dijk.
A southern European invasion then flooded Reds visa spots, with several Spanish signings and in 2013 Portuguese flash Fabio Ferreira penned a deal.

Since Barcelona legend Guillermo Amor departed in 2017 the club has signed visa players from Asia, Europe and Africa.
Adelaide has signed a total of 41 visa players, there has been some very memorable ones and others, if it wasn’t for Google, would have easily disappeared from the Reds history books

No. 1: Isaias Sanchez (Spain)
Position: Central midfielder:
Games: 168
Goals: 10
Biggest ex club: Espanyol (Spain)
Current Status: Al-Wakrah (Qatar)
Why: A true leader, a great defensive midfielder that gave 100 per cent in every match. The key to the 2016 A-League double. He was also the club’s first foreign captain and sorely missed in this current season.

No. 2: Marcos Flores (Argentina)
Position: attacking midfielder
Games: 31
Goals: 9
Biggest ex club: Club Atlético Newell's Old Boys (Argentina)
Current status: Adelaide City NPL
Why: Adelaide’s only Johnny Warren medal winner who became a fan magnet on and off the park. Incredible skill and vision.

No. 3: Cassio (Brazil)
Position: left back
Games: 124
Goals: 7
Biggest ex club: Flamengo (Brazil)
Status: Retired
Why: He bled for the Reds and brought true Brazilian determination to the side. A typical Brazilian-style left back that inspired a new generation. Played a huge part towards the 2008 AFC Champions League final.

No. 4: Marcelo Carrusca (Argentina)
Position: left midfielder
Games: 115
Goals: 25
Biggest ex club: Galatasaray (Turkey)
Current status: Retired
Why: The Argentine under 20 international added a new dimension to the Reds midfield with his clever skills and ability to read the game way before many players knew what was ahead. An integral part of the 2016 A-League double.

No. 5: Serginho van Dijk (Netherlands)
Position: striker
Games: 71
Goals: 29
Biggest ex club: Sepahan FC (Iran)
Current status: Retired
Why: A true goal machine, an old fashioned No. 9, big and strong that could head the ball beautifully, hold up play and had a sweet left foot.

No. 6: Sergio Cirio (Spain)
Position: attacker
Games: 106
Goals: 23
Biggest ex club: Atromitos Athens (Greece)
Current status: UD Ibiza (Spain)
Why: The Spaniard brought joy to a side which was edging towards its finest moments in the A-League in 2016. Elusive and dynamic, he holds the record of being the first man to score an FFA Cup winning goal in 2014.

No. 7: Fernando Rech (Brazil)
Position: attacking midfielder
Games: 37
Goals: 13
Biggest ex club: Palmeiras (Brazil)
Current status: Retired
Why: He was the X-factor who helped Adelaide claim a historic maiden A-League premiership. He wasn’t typically Brazilian in terms of style but his energy and goals in crucial games counted big time.

No. 8: Sergio Guardiola (Spain)
Position: striker
Games: 16
Goals: 3
Biggest ex club: Real Valladolid (Spain)
Current status: Real Valladolid (Spain).
Why: The influence of former Reds coach Barcelona legend Guillermo Amor landed the striker. He showed very good signs that he was a cut above but once he returned to Spain he really flourished.

No. 9: Iacopo La Rocca (Italy)
Position: utility (defence/midfield)
Games: 30
Biggest ex club: Grasshoppers (Switzerland)
Current status: Retired
Why: An unsung hero during Adelaide’s incredible 2016 double. A typically Italian centre back, uncompromising, cheeky, strong in a duel and ruthless with neat ball skills.


No. 10: Romario (Brazil)
Position: striker
Games: 4
Goals: 1
Biggest ex club: Barcelona (Spain)
Current status: Retired
Why: The FIFA World Cup winner put Adelaide on the global map in the early years of the A-League. He came here to party with his partner and his entourage playing foot-volley nightly at Glenelg. He wasn’t given the respect he deserved which impacted on his four-game stint. Sure he was old but the ones criticising him never came within a whisker of what he achieved in world football.

No. 11: Michael Jakobsen (Denmark)
Position: Centre back:
Games: 54
Biggest ex club: PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands)
Current status: Reds contracted until June
Why: The second foreigner to captain the Reds, Jakobsen hoisted the club’s third FFA Cup success last year. Quietly spoken Jakobsen allows his game to do all the talking.

No. 12: Gyawe Jonas Salley (Cote D’Ivoire)
Position: central midfielder
Games: 34
Biggest ex club: IM Zhongyou (China)
Current status: Retired
Why: Most fans just simply adored his work ethic and his ability to win what most defensive midfielders would give up as lost causes. He was always strong and was never flustered in the middle.

No. 13: Fabio Ferreira (Portugal)
Position: right midfielder
Games: 50
Goals: 13
Biggest ex club: Sydney FC
Current status: Sydney Olympic
Why: One of the most powerful wingers seen in the A-League after serving an apprenticeship under Mourinho at Chelsea. His explosive speed was just too hot to handle for many defenders.

No. 14: Pablo Sanchez Alberto (Spain)
Position: striker
Games: 51
Goals: 17
Biggest ex club: Sevilla (Spain)
Current status: Uncontracted
Why: He started just 25 of his 51 matches but became a crucial player with a sucker punch which led to many well timed goals at the back end of matches especially in the 2016 title winning season.

No. 15: Cristiano (Brazil)
Position: striker
Games: 48
Goals: 11
Biggest ex club: FC Basel (Switzerland)
Current status: Retired
Why: At the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup when he scored the goal of the tournament against Egypt’s Al Ahly. Wrongfully sent off in the 2009 grand final.

No. 16: Diego Walsh (Brazil)
Position: central midfielder
Games: 27
Goals: 4
Biggest ex club: Columbus Crew (US)
Current status: Retired
Why: He really stood up during the club’s incredible 2008 AFC Champions League campaign but his time in the A-League was brutally cut short by too many injuries

No. 17: Daniel Adlung (Germany)
Position: central midfielder
Games: 26
Goals: 5
Biggest ex club: VfL Wolfsburg (Germany)
Current status: Greuther Fürth (Germany)
Why: Added some great German flair in midfield under ex boss Kurz. Hard running, unselfish and ruthless, he also chimed in with timely goals.

No. 18: Shengqing Qu (China)
Position: striker
Games: 26
Goals: 8
Biggest ex club: Shanghai Greenland Shenhua (China)
Current status: Retired
Why: He really was an unknown quantity when he arrived for the A-League’s first season but soon won hordes of fans over with his finishing and creativity.

No. 19: Jeronimo Morales Neumann (Argentina)
Position: Attacker
Games: 53
Goals: 17
Biggest ex club: River Plate (Argentina)
Current status: Retired
Why: Neumann never had enough time to flourish to prove he was a brilliant marksman when former boss Josep Gombau let him go in 2014.

No. 20: Mirko Boland (Germany)
Position: central midfielder
Games: 26
Goals: 2
Biggest ex club: Eintracht Braunschweig (Germany)
Current status: Adelaide United until May 31 then Germany’s VfB Lübeck
Why: The likeable German’s brutal injury run over the past two seasons has unfairly taken away what he brings to the side when he is fit. His football sense in the middle is invaluable.

No. 21: Francisco Usucar (Uruguay)
Position: central midfielder
Games: 34
Biggest ex club: Técnico Universitario (Ecuador)
Current status: Uncontracted
Why: The tenacious midfielder added a typical Uruguayan feel to the Reds side from central midfield. But he was largely misunderstood during his two year tenure by systems which never suited his game – as balls forward kept flying over his head.",True,False,False,,,0,1585799799,,False,0,{},fm6pn00,True,t3_ftf9rk,False,False,t3_ftf9rk,/r/Aleague/comments/ftf9rk/ranking_adelaide_uniteds_visa_players_since_the/fm6pn00/,False,,1592859011,6,True,False,Aleague,t5_2s6c7,r/Aleague,public,,0,[],

Did you know:

1.) In France they force feed geese, and put metal tubes down their neck and pump food in their belly so they get fat?  Youtube it.  It's horrifying, but apparently delicious.

2.) Veal is basically baby cows chained/confined in small areas so they can't walk, and their muscle stays really tender.  Common western meal.

3.) Do you know what they do with all of the male chicks who don't lay eggs in America(and some parts of Europe)?  They put them on a conveyor belt into a grinder, where the male chicks are ground alive, then thrown away.

I suggest you watch a documentary on how the West treats animals at food farms.  It's gross as hell.  And, plenty of people in America hunt wild game and eat it.

Par contre sur les chiffres, je dois admettre que je ne peux pas y croire. Ils ont été les premiers, et donc plus « pris par surprise » que les autres. Même s’ils ont réagi vite en construisant des hôpitaux, 10 jours avec saturation c’est très long. Et si l’on se base sur leurs études, les chiffres annoncés ne correspondent pas.

En soit la sous-estimation des chiffres n’est pas un scandale, puisque finalement ce sera le cas dans plein de pays, et pour des questions politiques et pour des questions de « faisabilité « . Il y a sans doute eu dissimulation de politiques, mais si la Chine avait vraiment voulu cacher les choses, elle n’aurait pas fourni les études. Je pense que le reproche fait c’est que 2000 ça alerte moins que 80 000. Après les études étaient dispos, avec tous les détails possibles (et même des taux de mortalité sans doute surestimés. - franchement il n’y a pas eu de dissimulation là dessus, les effets potentiels sur le système nerveux central et les reins étaient aussi décrits), l’Europe et les Etats-Unis n’ont pas fait le boulot correct niveau préparation, donc c’est plus facile de mettre tout sur le dos de la sous-estimation.

Concernant les nouveaux cas et le reconfinement, ce n’est pas étonnant. Là encore c’est le scénario le plus probable dans tous les pays (reconfinement local dès qu’il y a un cluster). Et concernant les « courses « , ça ne paraît pas délirant : en fait ça devrait être le cas partout, après le reconfinement, dire aux gens de stocker de la nourriture pour le temps d’un nouveau reconfinement pour pouvoir réagir vite en cas d’apparition d’un nouveau cluster, tout boucler dans un certain rayon et le contenir le plus rapidement possible.

Là encore, entre les quelques cas locaux qui peuvent dégénérer rapidement en clusters, et les cas importés qui seront de plus en plus nombreux (vu qu’il y a de plus en plus de personnes contaminées partout dans le monde, il y aura forcément, à « traffic » égal, de plus en plus de gens contaminés parmi les gens venant dans le pays), rien d’étonnant.",True,False,False,,,0,1585810614,,False,0,{},fm727hy,True,t3_ft1ugk,False,True,t1_fm6z6rp,/r/france/comments/ft1ugk/mise_à_jour_coronavirus_01042020/fm727hy/,False,,1592865071,2,True,False,france,t5_2qhjz,r/france,public,,0,[],

Kelly Rice with her partner Andrea and their son Hugo. 

OPINION: We left the mighty shores of New Zealand on December 8, 2019.

A few short weeks later coronavirus stories started hitting the media. Most Westerners in Vietnam, including us, brushed it off. We were too busy enjoying the food, architecture and roaring around on scooters in Hoi An to worry about a little 'ole virus.

December and January flew by as we went basket boating, visited galleries, old ruins and made friends with a gorgeous water buffalo close to the markets we visited every day, along with thousands of other people. It was so much fun, but we soon realised it was time to start making money again.

Employment beckoned in one of the many jewels of Vietnam, Ha Long Bay. We packed up and arrived in mid February.

We started to hear more about the virus from every media outlet in the world. I became concerned and wrote my family back home asking if they thought New Zealand would close their borders. My family replied in typical fashion ‘oh don’t worry, we will come get you’. Bless them. Not one of us knew how serious things were about to get.

Later that month security guards started temperature checking us anytime we arrived or left our apartment, and we had to wear masks to the supermarket. At the time I felt quite annoyed, like my rights were being violated. How stupid was I?

In early March we needed to get our visas renewed which meant leaving Vietnam, and then returning, so we researched the countries, and their virus rates. We picked Chiang Mai, in Thailand, as their rate of cases was only about 60.

Chiang Mai was interesting in that there were no precautions from authorities whatsoever. No masks, no temperature checks. The only telling sign was that our hotel was quiet. The night market, however, was crawling with people. Europeans. Thousands of Europeans.

As I bartered to buy a beautiful painting from a lovely local woman, I heard the most awful hacking cough I’ve ever heard in my life. My blood ran cold. The lady and I locked eyes. I stopped bartering, gave her what she wanted and hurried back to our hotel immediately. We left Thailand and within two weeks their cases of the virus had skyrocketed.

As numbers of the dastardly virus around the world started to explode more countries started closing their borders, and rightly so. Transiting in countries became a big problem and the cost of remaining airlines exorbitant.

The number of emails between my family and I ramped up and most were urging us to come home.

My partner and I had so many discussions about it. Vietnam had kept the numbers down since January to 150. It’s now over 200. They have been stringent, and schools have been closed for over nine weeks and counting. We still had employment here and would likely continue to do so for the entire time this virus nightmare lasts.

If we went home, we would have been jobless. We would also be homeless, as I was not about to kick out our renter, who is a doctor, and whose services to New Zealand will be invaluable at this time. We would simply be a drain on resources at a time you need it most.

We decided to stay. I think we would have had an extremely high chance of catching the virus if we had chosen to fly to god-knows-where in order to get home.

We are here for the duration as I don’t see countries opening their borders or transit lounges for a year or more. I go in and out of sadness about that. I realised I had to get it all out in order to move on and accept my situation. 

Before the nationwide lockdown in Vietnam was announced, I wrote a song, walked into guitar shop called Guitar Quang Ninh, met a man who didn’t speak English. Google translate kindly explained what I wanted to do, and we did it, there and then. He was a beautiful human.

&gt; After the crisis, policy makers and regulators worldwide took steps to strengthen banks against future shocks. The Tier 1 capital ratio has risen from less than 4 percent on average for US and European banks in 2007 to &gt;more than 15 percent in 2017.1 The largest systemically important financial institutions must hold an additional capital buffer, and all banks now hold a minimum amount of liquid assets.

Also, I don't think you know how debt works. Debt is traded and sold by banks on a regular basis, it is a *good* thing that liquidity is strong. You don't want the economy to fall into a liquidity trap.

Debt, to companies and Central Banks, work differently to the debt you and I are accustomed to. Banks can sell debt to make a profit (and they often do) and banks can use it to formulate complex financial instruments (like swaps). Some debt will never be repaid, and that is a good thing, as it is used in the money creation process. Look at fractional reserve banking for example.

High Debt != Bad

You can't just say ""Hey, Debt is high!"" without looking at the financial ratios and assume it's a bad thing. Look at a Dupont analysis by JPM for example

Doing a leap of faith, I will assume you really haven't taken too much time to look into this and actually do not know much about the subject.

1 - It is never okay to target people for who they are/look instead of for what they have done.

2 - Police should never act based on extrapolations and generalisations regarding race, ethnicity, religion or any other but only based on someone's conduct.

3 - To do any other than that is to incur in racism, xenophobia, bigotry and authoritarianism.

4 - What you have done in your comments is a disgusting generalisation. People should not be treated as criminals based on how they look. One of the most basic human and legal rights is based on the defence of the presumption of innocence. It is one of the fundamental pillars of any stable democracy. To want to do away with that is to implicitly support dictatorial regimes.

5 - Apart from these moral and ethical considerations, your argument regarding such posture being the most ""effective"" is simply not true. The overwhelming majority of studies done on racial profiling show that they do not improve ""hit rates"", are highly ineffective and end up targeting hundreds of innocent people.

Given what you said in your previous comments, I assume you would like to read a little bit more on the subject, so I am leaving you a link for an extensive study, which if you read will make you understand why your posture is impossible to defend: [https://www.justiceinitiative.org/uploads/273f47cd-ada0-41bb-8353-a3e5eaf6d572/case-digests-ethnic%20profiling-european-systems-110813\_0.pdf](https://www.justiceinitiative.org/uploads/273f47cd-ada0-41bb-8353-a3e5eaf6d572/case-digests-ethnic%20profiling-european-systems-110813_0.pdf)

Mexico adds 1,378 cases of COVID-19 patients and 37 deaths caused by the virus, reported the federal Ministry of Health, which also revealed that around 70 million Mexicans have reduced their mobility amid the contingency.

In addition to the positive cases, there are another 3,827 under suspicion and 7,073 have already been ruled out, according to the latest reports on the outlook for the new coronavirus in the country released on Wednesday.

José Luis Zegarra Alomía, director of Epidemiology, explained that 46% of people who have become ill with COVID-19 have already been discharged, while 51% remain in isolation and the remaining 3% represent the cases of people who have passed away.

The majority of deaths have been recorded in Mexico City (8); Sinaloa (4); Hidalgo and Jalisco (3 in each); San Luis Potosí, Coahuila, Baja California (2 each); Durango, Edomex, Michoacán, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Guerrero, Nayarit, Tabasco and Zacatecas (upon death in each entity).

Hugo López - Gatell, Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion, said that he is that he has reduced the mobility of 70 million people in the country, so he does not see it necessary to declare a state of exception.

""We must be very satisfied with having such a participative community,"" said the official on Wednesday, after the weekend announced that the healthy distance and isolation measures of volunoquer were not being applied with ""rigor"", which would impact growth. accelerated contagion that is taking place in the country.

Discard use of quick tests

The undersecretary assured that Mexico does not use rapid tests to detect COVID-19, since these are not accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO).

""No competent health authority in the world has accredited rapid tests,"" said that representatives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said they have not endorsed any rapid tests.

Statements about the rapid tests come hours after the governor of Jalisco, Enrique Alfaro, will say that state officials asked the federal government to establish what tests they could apply and acquire to diagnose this virus infection.

The president pointed out that the evidence that his government acquired has not been able to enter the country because they do not have the certification of Cofepris and affirmed that the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador agrees to respond in no more than 72 hours.

""I do not want to think that what López-Gatell is doing is taking care of statistics, because it would be, literally, an act of treason against the country,"" Alfaro said in a previous press conference.

Unity and elections

The state and federal governments agreed on a pact of governability and unity in the face of the health emergency due to the coronavirus COVID-19, which this Wednesday already had electoral repercussions, due to the fact that the processes to renew the Congress of Coahuila and municipalities in up to until there are conditions to celebrate them, as determined by the National Electoral Institute (INE).

Although last Monday declared itself a health emergency by COVID-19 and recommended the suspension of non-essential activities, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador continues his tours of the country; just for this weekend it will have events in the State of Mexico, Mexico City and Morelos, the first two entities are the ones that report the most cases of patients with the new virus.

López Obrador has indicated that he will remain active in the contingency and that he will not isolate himself because his political adversaries seek to occupy his absence to take control of the country. However, in at least one of its meetings, a person has been presented who was later detected with COVID-19, in the case of the Governor of Hidalgo, Omar Fayad.

The Ministry of Health ruled out that at the moment a test is required to the president because he does not present symptoms, just this Tuesday his temperature remained within normal parameters. His attitude is far from other leaders who have undergone a screening test for the new coronavirus strain, such as Donald Trump (EU) or Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), among others.",True,False,False,,,0,1585825277,,False,0,{},fm7fp62,True,t3_ftkd9z,False,True,t3_ftkd9z,/r/nCoV/comments/ftkd9z/covid19_mexico_adds_1378_positive_cases_and_37/fm7fp62/,False,,1592871494,1,True,False,nCoV,t5_2da4g7,r/nCoV,public,,0,[],

&gt; We have multiple tests approved that take as little as 2 minutes for a result. 

That's new to me, as an European bystander last i heard those approved tests turned out to be barely any good. Might have been better to import actually working tests from other countries.  
Source: A friend of mine who is working in a hospital in NYC.

&gt; Many factories have been converted to make medical supplies. No one actually knows the number of tests anymore since the CDC stopped recording the testing numbers, only confirmed cases.  

The factories part is definitely true, although the US started with that a bit late since Trump can't seem to decide whether Corona is just another flu or actually dangerous, seems to change on a daily basis. (Just check his twitter)  
About the CDC part no longer disclosing testing numbers... I wouldn't be so sure it is a good thing. The numbers before they removed the statistic aren't very promising, why should that suddenly change? 

&gt; Korea is very homogeneous, but the US is diverse. This matters and affects the spread of the virus. It affects different types of people differently.  

Please define what you mean by the first sentence. It's not like Korea is just a big city, it also has rural areas. Again, I'm not quite sure why this would matter, so please elaborate what you mean by that.   
While yes, it affects different types of people differently, why would that make a difference in this context? IIRC both countries have younger and older generations, and from what the average BMI from both countries shows, I'd say the US has actually poorer general health.

&gt; The US is quickly surpassing testing numbers of other countries.  

I couldn't find anything on that since they removed their statistic, so please show me where you're getting that from. 

&gt; The reason these tests took so long to be made? We had a new virus emerge January 20th and tests take time to develop.  

Certainly true. But please answer me this: Why did other countries manage to test for the virus way more quickly? 

&gt;  At least we aren't publicly doxxing our citizens or throwing people in jail for leaving their houses... Yet 

Staying home is definitely helping in flattening the infection curve, but it's hard to actually enforce. Don't get me wrong, I also am striktly against doxxing, but, if i get the word right as a non-native speaker, please enlighten me on where that happened. In China they gave people an app wich told them in wich block there have been infected, but that's the full extend of what has been made *public*. 

Of course, most of this has been researched via google, so please do correct me should i be in the wrong somewhere.

Every EU country has it's own hiring laws and regulations for hiring non-EU citizens. There is no EU-wide legislation governing this. So, if you want to teach in France you need to look into *French* visa laws. This has nothing to do with Brexit (nor the EU for that matter), and will probably not be changing anytime soon. 

  
But to answer your overall question, I disagree with some other commenters that Brexit won't affect the hiring market for American teachers in Europe. In some EU countries like France and Spain where visa laws are extremely strict, I wouldn't be surprised if many schools turn to ""loopholes"" such as government programs, student visas, and freelancer/business visas. Or just hire more native teachers under the table, which is already very common. 

In countries where visa laws a bit more lax (Czechia, Poland, Hungary, for example), I'm already seeing more and more posts saying ""EU citizenship preferred"" as opposed to ""EU citizenship required,"" as well as more schools turning to legal loopholes and government programs.

And although I emphasize that it's not science, I have done some calculations based on numbers found on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and I have used them to stipulate how many deaths it is likely for the US to suffer.

And I've reached a number of 210 000.

However, working with this I also see the assumptions you need to make, and one assumption I made is that we are at the half way point in Italy and Spain. And assuming is dangerous... In addition you have factors like what precautionary measures the individual states will invoke, how long they are willing to keep said measures in place, even how warm this spring will be might influence numbers.

So, I can see why the experts are giving a wide range (100 k - 200 k is not exactly precise).

Now, seeing how reluctant the US in general is to tighten up like most European countries have done, I fear that 210 k might be on the lower side, and that 300 - 500 k might be a more realistic range UNLESS you do something serious to stop it.

Why am I saying this? Because both Spain and Italy is in a complete lockdown at the moment, you are only allowed outdoors to get medications and food, and police are enforcing this very strictly, and I do not believe that measures this tight is even possible in the US. Which means that the numbers of deaths will be significantly higher (I calculated deaths per million inhabitants) in the US.

Germany 'increases its COVID-19 tests to 500,000 per week'

Germany has increased its number of COVID-19 tests to 500,000 per week, a German scientist said on Thursday.

""The reason why Germany has so little deaths compared to its number of confirmed cases can be explained by the fact that we have a lot of laboratory diagnoses,"" said Dr Christian Drosten from Berlin's Charité University Hospital.

""We do 500,000 tests every week in Germany,"" he added.

Would they be alive today if they didn't get it? If the answer is 'yes' or 'probably', then the virus killed them.

Or, are you going  to argue that the people who die from a car accident didn't actually die in the accident since they had an underlying condition? 
The house fire didn't kill him, his diabetes did.
Died from a gunshot to the head? I think not. he had a bad heart.
Cancer? Nope. it was the asthma that killed him.

Just because someone is 80 and has health conditions doesn't mean they would have died when they did without the virus. All underlying conditions do is make someone more susceptible to the virus. It makes it harder for their body to fight it.

Too many people have the attitude that 'I'm healthy, so why do I have to stay home?' 
The fact is, many people will get the virus, but not show any symptoms of being sick at all. but they will still carry the disease to others.

**YouTube will reduce the quality of videos around the world starting Tuesday, an effort by the world’s most popular video site to ease internet traffic during the coronavirus outbreak.**

**Over the coming days, viewers will at first see YouTube videos in standard definition,** the company said. Users will still be able to watch in high definition if they want but will have to choose to do so.

**YouTube, part of** [**Alphabet Inc.**](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US)**’s Google, is extending a policy it already instituted in Europe, where regulators have asked major streaming services, including** [**Netflix Inc.**](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NFLX:US) **and Amazon Prime Video, to** [**reduce their bandwidth usage**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/amazon-netflix-cut-europe-s-stream-quality-to-ease-networks)**.**

The use of streaming services has [surged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/netflix-twitch-traffic-booms-because-everyone-needs-an-escape) in recent weeks as hundreds of millions of people stay home to contain the spread of the virus. While YouTube viewing has historically spiked in the evening when people are off work, consumption is now more steady across the day, the company said.

Streaming video requires more internet bandwidth than music, messaging or maps because of the size of the files transmitted. Google was the largest consumer of traffic volume on the internet last year, just ahead of Netflix, according to [a study](https://www.sandvine.com/blog/netflix-vs.-google-vs.-amazon-vs.-facebook-vs.-microsoft-vs.-apple-traffic-share-of-internet-brands-global-internet-phenomena-spotlight) by Sandvine, a network analysis firm. Recently, YouTube traffic has surged, even more, Sandvine [reported last week](https://www.sandvine.com/blog/covid-19-update-growth-of-video-during-work-at-home).

YouTube already limits the quality of the video based on the strength of a user’s internet connection. YouTube doesn’t believe the world will run out of internet bandwidth any time soon but is taking a preemptive measure given growing concerns at the government level.

“We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,” Google said in a statement.

Yes because most pandemics originate in the tropics because of the combination of humidity, heat and high biodiversity exponentially increase the amount of pathogen vectors.

Most of the major epidemics of the 21st Century have been dengue fever, which is carried by mosquitoes.

The last minor flu epidemic - a strain of H3N2 - was known as Australian flu in most of the world, because it originated in Australia.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42602394](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42602394)

Queensland also had a dengue fever outbreak in 2009. So is this because of Australia's ""lack of oversight, regulation or simple common sense when it comes to bush meat and food prep.""

The origin of the majority of major viruses that don't use mosquitoes as vectors is Africa. A near entirety of viral pandemics originate in tropical areas.

The reasons that pandemic originate in the countries you mention is because they have are undergoing a large scale process of urbanization, much like the cause of the waves of typhoid fever in the 19th Century. This process brings animals and humans into close contact, in semi rural-urban environments, as well as through land clearing to make room for cities. 

And while we sit here on our high horse, 90 Samoans died because of a measles pandemic that started in New Zealand. So congratulations on your own, personal lack of oversight, regulation or simple common sense when it comes to bush meat and food prep I guess.

&gt;Am I racist when I say that some people in China managed to figure out how make fake eggs out of random chemicals that are cheaper than even caged chicken eggs and sell them to each other as the real thing

That sounds like food science and product development to me. You think the nugget is a part of a real chicken bro?

How come when Chinese scientists invent something it's some people figuring stuff out with random chemicals, but when American and European scientists are working on the same thing it is ""the biggest extant threat to our dairy industry and a cause to diversify our economy? Lmao

Nothing you will see only static and some wierd spurs.

If you tune around 10Ghz you might see Telemetry Beacon channels from geostationairy satellite's if the dish is pointed to the clarke belt :)

Vsat and other traffic is also visible, even possible to decode some small symbolrate TV channels with the SDR.

You can find the frequencies of beacons overhere [http://frequencyplansatellites.altervista.org/](http://frequencyplansatellites.altervista.org/)

If you are located around Europe, inside the footprint of Es-Hail Oscar-100 at 25.9 East.

That is very nice to try out with a SDR and any type of dish will suite.

""Interestinly enough, a boy who the western media claims was attacked by the Syrian government appeared in the Hague to testify that in fact, rebels staged the attack. There is plenty more proof, I can provide links to anyone who is interested.""

I don't like the rebels, I like the Syrian people who are the real good side in this conflict and the real victim

Why can't just Assad leave the power and give his people what they want ? why can't he let them choose their leader and decide their fate ? is it really a tough choice to do even though many other fellas like him in the other parts of the world did it and nothing bad happened to them ?

Eastern Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, Ukraine became more influenced by the West and therefore Russia didn't like this, instead of letting Ukrainians deciding what they want to do, Russia dragged Ukraine into bloody conflict by supporting militias in the Eastern Ukraine/Donbass and helping them split the nation while at the same time they invaded the Crimean peninsula and wanted to make it independent too but then decided to just annex it to the Russian Federation

* Not respecting the will of the people : Check

* Supporting terrorist militias : Check

* Stealing an entire territory in a very illegal way : Check

* Supporting the division of an entire nation : Check

Russia did a really good job in ruining Ukraine so they won't join the west, Noice.

""What do you even know about Ukraine? Be careful: my mother is Ukrainian and my father is Russian. I might not know much about Syria (I had refugees from Syria living on my street in the UK, and they gravitated to me because I am Russian and greeted them with respect: no resentment like Iraqis have for Americans) - but I sure know about Eastern Europe, so please don't lie.""

Ah cool and I am the son of Donald Trump lol

I don't care if you are Ukrainian or not, it doesn't make your words facts

""Are you fucking retarded, or what?""

or maybe I'm just being sarcastic, should I make it clear next time or something ? didn't I already mention that Putin doesn't like Communism or you simply don't read what I wrote

""Every pro-Western, Russophobic (fake) news outlet will tell you that Putin isn't a communist. You look really, really dumb right now - you're out of tune with your own band""

So Putin is a Communist ?

""No, but a nation of brain-deads wouldn't have better medicine than the US. I never called Cuba the greatest, let alone a great, nation.""

Excellent, now you are closer to acknowledging that Cuba is a terrible nation for their stupid laws like banning the entire Internet

""Yes, that right there. Can you give me a reason as to how Tunisia joining NATO would be beneficial for... ring-ding-ding Tunisia?

If Algeria or Libya attacks you, you're fucked - no one wants to put troops on the ground.""

Or actually, Algeria and Libya would be fact and just like the NATO bombed the heck out of Serbians, Libyans etc... there wouldn't a problem in doing it again, if the attackers aren't gone yet then the liberation of Kuwait scenario will happen again, invade the hostile nation, overthrow the stupid regime and install a new one, not that I want that to happen, I don't want it to happen and I don't see the events in the Middle East are good, the US should have never intervened but my point is, if Tunisia is part of NATO then all the other NATO members are obliged to defend, this is not because the NATO fellas are nice and kind people who love Tunisia, it's because the alliance would pointless and useless if a member is left out, the US doesn't want their alliance to be weak not because they love Tunisia, they don't

So having Tunisia part of NATO will make any hostiles think twice or more before doing anything

""Perhaps you didn't know, but membership in NATO comes with a ""one for all, and all for one"" condition - meaning that if Turkey gets attacked by, or declares war on Russia - all nations, including Austria and Greece (who do not want to fight with Russia, and the US, who just doesn't see a fight with Russia as convenient) has to step in and protect/support Turkey in their endeavours.""

Well actually, Greece and Austria did a good job in helping the US against the Russians during the cold war and there isn't any valid reason of not doing so again if needed but Russia won't be stupid by involving itself in a direct war and the same thing goes for Turkey

""No one is going to get involved in Arabs being Arabs and fighting/showing each other who has a bigger dick. You did this before Sykes-Piccott and continue to do this now all over the Arab-speaking world.""

Liberation of Kuwait and the US support of Saudis in Yemen is a clear evidence that what you are saying is completely wrong

""If America decides to invade one of your neighbours, you have to send your young men to die for America's imperial expansionist policy and then you have to explain to their mothers and fathers what exactly their son died for. Neither a move that will help someone in their political campaign nor something beneficial for Tunisia.""

Why would the US invade one of my neighbors ? could it be because they are truly a bad regime who tried to invade us many times before ? or just because the US likes to invade others ?

Still and I repeat myself again, I do not want my neighbors to be invaded but I do not want them to invade us, I would love to see the US changing its policy to a better one that doesn't include invading others and this is something that is more likely than North Korea or China or Russia changing their policies

Shotgun not registering vit hits.

1) La réalité, c'est qu'on pouvait et devait y être préparé. Des épidémies (encore plus graves), il y en a déjà eu par le passé. Le fait que ce soit une pandémie ou non, c'est secondaire.

- China was the first country that dealt with the virus, nobody knew how to prepare for it at the beginning. They didnt know how the virus was transmitted and the fact that the incubation period can be that long
- they took time to find out about the genome and then started the production of test kits, there weren't enough test kits in the beginning either 
- this explains why the numbers were low, a lot of cases were not tested and so were not reported. They didn't deliberately cover things up.
- after lockdown, most people had to stay home and they relied solely by online delivery for groceries. E-commerce is well developed and the delivery service is very common as well. Military and police have strictly stopped people from going out.
- each confirmed case was shown on the map, it's very transparent as everyone knew where the patient lived and their whereabouts.

&gt; Eu acredito, e isto são as minhas opiniões e não argumentos políticos, que cada um deve casar com quem entender, consumir o que bem entender e fazer com o seu corpo o que bem entender.

E onde é que é liberal que o BE/PAN queiram que tu só possas casar com o número de pessoas que eles quiserem, que não possas consumir uma carrada de coisas porque eles vêm isso como pouco saudável. É isso que é liberal?

&gt;Se assim fosse estaríamos a viver em anarquia.

Anarquia pressupõe a inexistência de um sistema governativo

&gt; No entanto, a legalização do aborto traz benefícios fundamentais, como no caso de engravidamentos (não sei se é assim que se escreve, mas pronto) por violação e outras situações delicadas.

Agora diz-me, é liberal que queiram controlar que palavras possas ou não usar? É liberal que queiram controlar quem pode ou não entrar em actos (quer sociais, quer económicos) consensuais e 100% voluntários? É liberal que queiram literalmente controlar?


É apenas desonesto chamar-lhes liberais porque concordas com a liberalização de XYZ. Não estou a fazer qualquer juízo de valor em relação à liberalização de XYZ, estou apenas a dizer que isso não é ser liberal: Se apenas liberalizas as coisas que concordas e continuas a proibir as outras (ou tentas proibir coisas novas) isso não é ser liberal, é substituir o que tu concordas pelo que discordas. Hipócrita como o caralho dizer que isso é liberal.

In Brazil Italians were brought for two reasons: 1) to substitute blacks as paid laborers in Coffee plantations in the Southeast after slavery was outlawed, and 2) to populate areas in the South that were largely unpopulated.

However, contrary to the US where Italian immigrants had a generally lower level of education than other Americans, here they were considerably more educated than Brazilians, even though the Italians who came were poor for Italian standards. They were also much lighter than the average Brazilian, which was a mix of Portuguese, Spanish, Blacks and native Americans. That meant they were seen as more socially desirable. In fact, in the late Brazilian empire, the administration effectively sought to bring Italians and Austrians to ""whiten"" the population.

Combining better education and social desirability, they quickly went from poor laborers to skilled workers and then to form a significant portion of Brazilian economic elites. Much of the Brazilian push towards industrialization in the early 20th century is commonly attributed to Italian immigration. In the densely populated southeast, they quickly mixed with the Brazilian population.

However, in the south of Brazil, which was very lightly populated back then, they did not come as laborers but as settlers. In this region they received land to farm and later formed a lot of towns and small cities which to this day are mostly populated by people of Italian descent. There, Italian traditions subsisted for a long time, and the population is mostly white, as opposed to the rest of the country. The same thing happened to Austrian/Germans a couple decades later. 

So here in Brazil Italian descendents are seen as hardworking, entrepreneurial and efficient. Same goes for German and Austrian descendents. Also, some people make sure to highlight their European descent and cheer for Italian and German national teams, as they want to be seen as ""European"" to increase their own status and self-esteem. 

As a teenager I used to pay attention to these things and feel proud of being of families descending from Italians with a little bit of Austrian and German mixed in. Now I just think it's silly and feel embarassed when other people do that. There's nothing special about where your great grandparents were born. 

But it sure is advantageous to be white of European descent when you travel and live abroad. I lived in Sweden and my Italian name and skin color made it easier to integrate compared to other Brazilians. The same goes on here in the US, though in the summer depending on how much sun I get people mistake me for middle-eastern or something (I have quite fair skin but dark curly hair and brown eyes).",True,False,False,,,0,1585845409,,False,0,{},fm89p62,False,t3_dm0til,False,True,t3_dm0til,/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/dm0til/how_are_italian_americans_viewed_in_usa/fm89p62/,False,,1592885790,1,True,False,AskAnAmerican,t5_2uah7,r/AskAnAmerican,public,,0,[],

1) Ars Magica - Ars Magica is based firmly in ""Mythic Europe"" - Europe largely as *people thought it was*. The time frame is very close (mid 13th century is the default, IIRC). There is ample support for demonic influence and Christian faith, because see above ""Mythic Europe"". And the [4th Edition Core Book](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/ars-magica-4th-edition-core-rulebook) is **free** and has been for years. Ars Magica, of course, puts its focus on *Magi*, but there is plenty there to support a band of adventurers without a Covenant to form their base and core. And like I said, **free**.

2) Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne - this game is based on King Arthur Pendragon and shares its narrow focus. Instead of Arthur's knights though, they're Charlemagne's. Now, Charlemagne is too early for you but as the book says:

&gt; The game starts off in the feudal Dark Ages, but thanks to an acceleration of time, the Carolingian setting evolves into a later medieval world, playing out the entire Middle Ages in the 47 years of Charlemagne’s reign. To represent this fast-forward evolution of the Franks, the Paladin chronology is not static. Customs change, armor improves, new weapons and better hors- es become available, as well as new troop types and fortifications. The pace of these changes is such that 11 years of game time approximates a century of history, bringing the campaign not just through the Carolingian legends, but through the history of the entire European Middle Ages.

That ought to be plenty for you to get to 1205. Like KAP, Paladin is lethal and focuses on a knight's family as a solution to mortality. This book isn't free, but for [a 460+ page high-quality PDF, the $20](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234701/PALADIN-Warriors-of-Charlemagne) isn't steep.

3) For all historical and realistic gaming, we must acknowledge the king - GURPS. [The free, lite version](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/236828/GURPS-Lite-Fourth-Edition) will a) tell you if you like it and b) probably have *everything you really need* for the game you described. If you need more, there are a huge range of excellent period and geographical historical sourcebooks.

4) Finally - you might like Mythras - formerly RQ6. This finely-honed d100 system *also* has a pretty high emphasis on historicity, including a [Mythic Constantinople book](http://thedesignmechanism.com/Mythic-Earth.php).

On the one hand it makes sense that the EU is not so active in this discussion. The EU doesn't have that much of a mandate here because healthcare systems are governed on the national level. Trying to set up EU-wide measures doesn't work because our countries' healthcare systems are so different. For example, Germany has 7x more IC beds per capita than the Netherlands, so 'flattening the curve' in Germany means something very different than here.

Antonescu nu putea să oprească legionarii pentru că ei erau sursa principală de recrutări, iar fără soldați ne-ar fi învins rușii. Antonescu în schimb a pedepsit aspru toți generalii care își scăpau batalioanele din mână.

Nu știu dacă ai citit în întregime ce ți-am scris eu. Am explicat mai sus că Legionarii, deși fuseseră ilegalizați de Antonescu, încă aveau mulți adepți, iar masacrele de care îmi povestești au fost făcute fără acordul lui Antonescu, acesta a dat ordine de acoperire ca să o pățească el și nu soldații scăpați de sub control.

Deportările de la Transnistria? I-a trimis în Transnistria pe deportați ca să nu i-i trimită lui Hitler în diverse lagăre. 

Evreii nu au fost uciși de Antonescu. Antonescu a avut un acord cu liderul comunității evreiești de atunci: evreii donau bani pentru război și Antonescu îi proteja de naziști. Antonescu nu avea nici un motiv să dea în evrei că nu mai avea bani pentru război. Nu i-a omorât! El a încercat să-i protejeze cât a putut, văzându-și în același timp de interesele țării lui.

Argumentul cu ""păpușa lui Hitler"" nu e valid. Antonescu s-a opus lui Hitler și dominației germane în România! Antonescu a refuzat ajutor din partea lui Hitler în Rusia, pe motiv că armata română se descurca și nu voia să pară că depinde de Hitler. Este extrem de eronat să spui că Antonescu era mai puțin decât egal cu Hitler în această privință.

Antonescu nu avea ce crime să oprească deoarece el nu comitea aceste crime. Este de apreciat că a făcut negocieri, pentru că se vede că punea interesul național înaintea propriei persoane. Era evident chiar și în vremea aceea că pe noi ne iau rușii, și oricum cu toate ordinele de acoperire, Antonescu nu avea cum să pună propria viață pe primul loc. S-a sacrificat de mai multe ori pentru țară. Știa cât de gravă este situația de când a luat puterea de la Carol II.

Fără Antonescu,  pățeam și noi ca polonezii: de o parte Rusia, de alta Germania.

That's because we didn't evolve to engage in capitalism, but that doesn't mean capitalism isn't better. We need to be logical, not emotional or instinctual.

And we're not. ""If humans were different, capitalism would work"" has no basis in argument. Unhappiness is bad, income inequality leads to it, that means income inequality is bad.

&gt;Hording resources doesn't take value away from others in capitalism. Pretty much everything that is valuable is created or formed by people's labor. Any system that encourages more people to work harder or smarter will create value. If hoarding resources are a part of that system, then it creates value.

This isn't true. Unfortunately, capitalism doesn't encourage work nearly as much as something like socialism does. Capitalism encourages ""having money"". Most money is produced not through work, but through simply having capital that makes you money.

That's why rich people don't arise from doing a job really, really well, but just supplying wealth to businesses.

But of course, hoarding resources does objectively take away value from others... because they can't have those resources. You've just presumed that capitalism encourages better work, with no basis for it, to justify the objective fact that one person having something means another cannot.

&gt;Capitalism is that system. China and India GREATLY increased quality of life after adopting capitalism. 

Sure, capitalism's better than the feudalistic system we had beforehand.

&gt;The dichotomy between west and east Berlin, and North and South Korea also show the superiority of capitalism. 

The superiority of democracy over autocracy. Hardly capitalism over other economic models, because we already knew autocracy was bad and leads to shitty countries.

&gt;The Nordic countries you mentioned are not less capitalist than America or other European countries. It's a complicated amalgamation of some regulations other countries don't have, and some other countries do. They have high taxes, welfare, and work week restrictions, but no minimum wages, nor many hoops to jump through to start a business.

And limiting the free market and reducing it is by its nature, anti-capitalist. They might not have a minimum wage, but they have far, far more regulation than the US, which scored a 6 on the Ease of Business Index, compared to a 9 and 10 for Norway and Sweden, respectively.",True,False,False,,,0,1585850395,,False,0,{},fm8ja23,False,t3_ftdcg9,False,True,t1_fm8i8tl,/r/AskReddit/comments/ftdcg9/thoughts_on_democracyrepublics_are_they_in_your/fm8ja23/,False,,1592890341,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,,0,[],

What you're assuming is that some differance in genetics has caused europeans to be more ""supreme"", which there is no scientific reason to assume.

European societies are some of the best places to live in the world rivaled only by the Koreans and the Japanese. Societies are obviously a product of both the people and the environment and if it's not entirely environmental then it's obvious that genetics plays a large part since people are the products of their genes and the environment. So when you say there is no genetic component, you are effectively saying that the outcomes of these societies are the product of only environmental factors. 

&gt;That was never my point. My point was that you can't claim that europeans are genetically superior to africans when the evidence shows that there is no such thing as being genetically african.

Wow you are actually dumber than I thought, I apologize for not making this even simpler for you. YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DETERMINE SOMEONES ANCESTRY FROM THEIR GENETICS, NOT ONLY IS THIS SETTLED SCIENCE WE LITERALLY HAVE INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE MONEY DOING EXACTLY THAT. You are beyond ignorant. 

&gt;You claimed that the studies were flawed because they weighed all variance equally, so if you think that's a problem you're gonna have to go against what all scientists think and post evidence that there are some genes whose variations matter much more in determinging if a race is going to exhibit ""supremacy"" than usual.

I never said the studies are flawed what I said was YOUR takeaway from those studies is wrong. As for *post evidence that there are some genes whos variations matter much more in determining if a race is going to exhibit ""supremacy""* you once again show that you don't even have two brain cells to rub together. Lets say once cluster of genes determines how long your toes will be and the other determines your intelligence. Obviously the cluster that determines intelligence is much more important that the one that determines toe size for ""supremacy.""

People like that are basically traitors in my opinion, who have no place in Belgian politics. I welcome laws or consitutional amendments meant to block those people from have any further influence in our institutions.

I do not have a problem with an EU-double nationality though. The EU is a union of certain fundamental values, so there shouldn't be big ideological differences when it comes to a Belgian with the nationality of another EU member state.

An important asterisk is the non-EU countries that make it impossible for their citizens to renounce their nationality.

The hoard was infamous for a reason. Their mayhem stretched over vast continents like a plague. They aren't just responsible for the murder and subjugation of countless people, they also reset the development of certain parts of the world.

Back in Islamic history there was a period called the Islamic Golden Age. This age was a middle eastern equivalent to the Renaissance period in Europe. It was a beautiful time for the development of art and science and culture. 

The caliphate was located in present day Baghdad, Iraq and within this caliphate was one of the original university systems in the world. **It was referred to as the House of Wisdom or the House of Knowledge.**

___
**The scholars from this place are actually responsible for why we know about Socrates and Plato and other famous philosophers from ancient Greece. They translated all of the old texts from ancient Greek to Arabic and then from Arabic to other languages which we could study. They literally saved Greek philosophy from being lost to history after ancient Greece fell.**
___

Individuals from around the world traveled to this place to study science and philosophy and to discuss ideas in a scholarly way. 

This came to an end when the Monguls invaded. They swept through the region and they DECIMATED it. The stories about their crimes are heartbreaking and it isn't known for sure how much was lost to their mayhem.

It was said that they threw so many scrolls and books into the surrounding rivers that they ran black with ink. 

Some historians actually argue that much of the instability in the middle east today can be traced back to this conquest. Their argument is that a leadership structure which took so long to develop and perfect had collapsed into itself and the region never really found a replacement. People who lived in rural areas and weren't in the major cities when the monguls invaded were the ones who survived. The end result is the undereducated and those without leadership experience tried to replace something they just couldn't. 

Imagine if you had no idea what engineering was after society collapsed and you didn't have a reference for where to start to rebuild. Similar idea.

The Ottomans established SOMETHING but even they failed. The region has been unstable for so long primarily because it hasn't been allowed to establish a natural order within its own politics. 

Much like Europe took hundreds of years to eventually reach their natural order, the middle east needs to be allowed to figure out a strategy which works best for them. 

This is arguably traced back to the loss of that original order.",True,False,False,,,0,1585851973,,1585852291,0,{},fm8mbsv,False,t3_ftremm,False,True,t3_ftremm,/r/AskReddit/comments/ftremm/which_historical_figure_has_effected_our_current/fm8mbsv/,False,,1592891781,2,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,,0,[],

I remember when you could only buy them for gold; they were much rarer, obviously, and barely an issue. If someone wanted to (arguably) waste 30 gold every battle spamming them, that was fine. They were literally paying the price for no longer needing to deal with armour. Still a questionable ability to begin with, though. If it were up to me there'd be no gold ammo, or their additional penetrative power would be severely reduced so you still had to have a brain to use them, and heavy tanks remained, y'know, powerful. The whole point of armour is to force enemies to think around you; flank you, team up against you, outsmart or outplay you in any way. That should really be the case for all tanks, but in different ways, of course. But with gold ammo, which retains its name despite being available for credits, suddenly you're lugging all this heavy armour around and it's not doing you any good because every enemy and their dog is shooting gold, if not constantly then at least they switch as soon as they see you in your O-I or your Maus.

&gt;I'm not convinced.

Ok. I'll be clearer. You can't read. Check your link again. Perhaps look at the date. 

&gt;Most of the countries on that list I provided, since you can't fucking source anything yourself, have higher mortality rates per 1 million people than the US while starting afterwards and have had higher mortality rates for 2 weeks now.

Yawn. Your metric is still dumb. Comparing the United states with a population of 330 million and large parts of the country that doesn't have significant traffic with the rest of the world is not all comparable to any single country in the European Union. If you want to be comparable, try doing the numbers for the EU as a whole. That would be more analogous to the USA. 

You know what is also comparable though? Single States. Let's look at New York. 

New York State on its own. Let's use your metrics.

Thomas Jefferson:
Although Jefferson was a follower of Jesus at one point in his life, he despised what Christianity had become as he explains below.

""To the corruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense he wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others; ascribing to himself every human excellence; &amp; believing he never claimed any other."" - Letter to Benjamin Rush (12 April 1803)

Even though he was a follower of Jesus he didn't want religion in our government, and he makes that very clear in the quotes below.

""I am for freedom of religion, &amp; against all maneuvres to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect over another."" - Letter to Elbridge Gerry 1799

""Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the Common Law."" -letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper, 1814
""History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose."" - to Baron von Humboldt, 1813

""Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a Censor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."" -- Notes on the State of Virginia, Query XVII

---

George Washington:
""Religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause. Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind, those which are caused by the difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing, and ought most to be depreciated. I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy, which has marked the present age, would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see the religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society."" - letter to Edward Newenham, 1792

""Gouverneur Morris had often told me that General Washington believed no more of that system (Christianity) than did he himself."" -Thomas Jefferson, in his private journal, Feb. 1800

---

James Madison:
""Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise."" -letter to Wm. Bradford, April 1, 1774

""The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries."" -1803 letter objecting use of gov. land for churches

""During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.""

As for the government taking someone down or not. The discussion began with me outlaying how I think the connection between the people  and the state should be.

we arrived at me stating that good state run schools and free university would benefit social upward mobility and help prevent the isolation of the upper crust as well as help make laws that benefitted not only the upper class, but the whole society.

Yasmin at this point decided to stop repeating that everything the state touched would eventually go to shit. I assume he sees the same problems I do, but he failed to tell me how a lean state would fight them. He also saw, probably just like you, that it was not the job of the state to help its worse off citizens, convinced that to the state, to the population as a whole, helping them would not be beneficial. they should help themselves.

Now, I don't see it that way. In my opinion, no state has the right to exist that doesn't try to care for all its citizens. You see it different. And usually, I would like to ask you, why. or what you think the legitimization of a state is. What i would have liked Yasmin to ask.

The immediate benefit to the wearer of a mask is the social pressure for others to also wear the mask - that a stigma is created for those who selfishly choose to not wear any face covering.

Going outside without one is frowned on as an antisocial action that puts your community at risk. In fact, the community reaction has been so strong that the government has responded by making it illegal to go out in public without a mask.

\- The way the paragraphs are divided can make the story confusing for the reader and make them miss the main point. For instance, in the paragraph below - the main point is not about the weather, it's about the meeting with the boss. If you're reading the story quite quickly, you might miss this incredibly important set-up entirely.

""It was a torrid night, with not even the slightest hint of wind to blow a little air over my face. Mr. Willman - my boss at Shanghai Tonight - had just given me an earful about the last article I wrote, a great piece in my opinion about the horrid drinking habits of the German community infesting our concession, and had sent me to look into some scoop he’d found.""

\- Building off this point - there's a lot of description where I'm not sure what is the point. For instance - why does it matter that it is a stormy night? Why is the Soviet Union's absence important? Why is there so much description of the attractive women? It makes sense to describe the man as he is important later, but will she be as important later in the story?

\- Is there some description you could add to the latter half of the story/ the gambling scene that reminds the reader that they are in Shanghai?

&amp;#x200B;

Franklin D. Roosevelt, nor the congress or senate, would ever had allowed the British Isles or huge parts of Europe to fall to the Germans. They would´t have accepted that. Therefore there were always going to supply Europe with tanks, oil and guns. We also saw this after the second world war, with the Monroe Doctrine, but with communism instead of Nazism.

&amp;#x200B;

While it´s true that Japan also had plans against the USSR, i just don´t see the USSR having that big of a regard when it comes to Japan, when they also need to face the Germans.  Besides I suspect the USA to intervene if they also saw that the Japanese were gaining land in the USSR. I have never said that the Japanese only had something the USA, because that´s a false statement. I just only mentioned the USA due to them being the primary enemy of Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

I don´t see the USSR falling due to missing recruitable population. The USSR raised 200 divisions two months after the start of Operation Barbarossa ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II/Invasion-of-the-Soviet-Union-1941)).  Those sudden divisions were 50 more divisions than at the start of Barbarossa. All in all the USSR had a 110 more divisions than the Germans. By the end of 1941 the Soviets had give or take 700.000 more men than the Germans ([Source](https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/was-the-russian-military-a-steamroller-from-world-war-ii-to-today/)). The Germans were doomed to fail before them even starting. While it´s true the Soviets had problems with providing it´s population with food, it clearly wasn´t big enough of a problem in our timeline to make the USSR fall.

&amp;#x200B;

The estimate that Germany would run out of oil in autumn 1941, was an estimate made i May 1941. That was before the Germans secured many more oilfield in Romania, by buying out the competition. This securing of oil in Romania of course led the Germans to extend their oil depots to 1942, which was when the war turned in the Soviets favour.

&amp;#x200B;

Fall Blau failed massively, and were the final push to the Germans, pushing them all the way to Berlin. I still don´t believe that the Americans would simply put a blind a eye to the Germans (and the rest of  the axis powers) taking over half the globe, and leaving them to do as they pleases. The USA had to intervene in some way or form. And I firmly believe that even the population of the USA would see the need to intervene, just as they did during The Great War.

&amp;#x200B;

Rommel and the rest of the Afrika Korps didn´t stand a chance against the British and French in North Africa. Germany had to intervene again, again, again, to stop the British advance due to an incompetent Italy. Rommel simply didn´t have a chance to prepare against the British due to his sudden involvement in theater.

&amp;#x200B;

On the subject of the Italian ships. I made a mistake. They were of course supposed to go from Europe to Africa, not the other way around. Derp :P. Page 370, around the end of the Italy segment. ([Source](https://books.google.dk/books?id=tdbEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;hl=da&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false))

&amp;#x200B;

After Dunkirk Churchill took a decision. He chose not to surrender to the Germans. That was a crucial decision because it showed where the British stood in the war. As long as the supplies continued to arrive, the rest of empire wasn´t too important to the British population. The British population trusted Churchill and knew that he would lead them out of war in one piece. The British population stood closer than ever before, and social classes were demolished because the British needed to stand united. ([Source](https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_People_s_War.html?id=Wim0UKS5HNwC&amp;redir_esc=y))

&amp;#x200B;

It´s true that the Germans didn´t leave equipment behind while there were on the offensive. I meant during retreat they left equipment behind. That´s my mistake for not being precise enough.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I don´t think a German victory is possible. I don´t think the U.S. not supporting Europe during The Second World War are realistic either. They couldn´t just turn a blind eye to the rest of the world, while the world were taken over by a Nazi/fascist ideology, that were miles away from the U.S. ideology. I think you just need to look at the cold war, before we see a pattern were the U.S. wants to do anything in it´s power to stop a foreign enemy.

Hungary joins EU member states' statement - a statement [released](https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-justice/news/statement-of-hungary-02042020) on the Ministry of Justice website begins Thursday evening .

The statement [came out Wednesday night](https://444.hu/2020/04/01/13-nyugat-europai-kormany-kozos-nyilatkozatban-figyelmeztet-hogy-veszhelyzetre-hivatkozva-sem-lehet-fellepni-a-jogallamisag-es-a-szabad-sajto-ellen) , first from 13 Western European governments (more have since joined) and said that

&gt;nor can the rule of law and the free press be invoked on grounds of emergency.

The text of the statement made clear reference to the Hungarian Authorization Act (eg  *signatories are deeply concerned that certain emergency measures adopted may jeopardize the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights* ), but have never explicitly stated that they are taking action by the Hungarian government. .

&gt;Thus, the Hungarian government sparked a troll diplomatic counterattack and joined itself.

'Emergency measures should be limited to what is strictly necessary, should be proportionate and temporary, subject to periodic review and in accordance with the principles and international law obligations referred to above. In addition, they should not restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

The signatory governments believe that we must overcome this crisis together, standing up to European principles and values, and therefore support the European Commission's initiative to examine and implement emergency measures in each Member State and to call on the General Affairs Council to consider it necessary. , deal with the issue, ”the Hungarian government now says.

If we drastically increased taxes on middle class people, it would kill us. Most people haven’t budgeted for an extra 15-30% expense.

3-  Many of the countries already have protectionist policies in force. the EU has protectionist policies in force and it seems to work for them. China manipulates its currency and uses near slave labor. (I am not that familiar with japans business practices so can’t speak to it.)

Now till that point she had shown pictures of stabbings, gang violence and a person who died in a fire. So some people were smart enough to leave, but morbid curiosity is a bitch. She showed pictures of the inside of a shed with tools, a workbench with some blood on it, meat hooks etc... She wasn't allowed to show all of the pictures, but she started to tell the story of a serial killer who killed people who went camping in the nearby wilderness.

The last pictures were of his trophy case. A shelf of small children shoes. She had to take photo's of every pair.

You are wrong about the science, women don't care way more. It's a lot narrower of a gap than you think. I have university books on this, multiple. As someone interested in solving mysteries of course I'm drawn to psychology. What you are talking about is referred to as the evolutionary model of attraction and is an old idea which has now been mostly discarded for other ones.

The textbooks are all in complete agreement and are very current.

Women have a few more caveats of things they also want, such as extroversion and confidence. And also we can like someone MORE from things like similarity of personality/attitudes, proximity which means being around them often, and there was something else I have forgotten but could get if you really wanted to know.

To be unattractive to the point that you are actually sexually repulsive is unusual. Few men look that beta and ugly etc. most of the ones who do you'll see in the crowds at pickup bootcamps or on incel forums.

To substantially reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, we need to put a price on pollution. If this price is combined with a dividend, it would make most people better off.

* The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is 100% private, but it is not 100% a political party. Political parties exist at the state (and territory) level in the US. The purpose of the DNC is to keep the state level parties aligned onto a cohesive national-level strategy.

* The DNC keeps these parties aligned through the Democratic National Convention (also called the DNC), which is where delegates are sent in by all the state (and territory) democratic parties. The delegates vote on a national platform (manifesto), DNC bylaws, and most importantly, nominate a presidential candidate.

* The state (and territory) parties are 100% political parties, but they are not 100% private, at least compared to European political parties.

Freesync takes care of that, running a game at 90fps will automatically run the monitor at 90Hz as well, so you don't get any screen tearing. I have noticed zero tears on my 144Hz Freesync display, while they were constant on my previous standard 60Hz monitor without Freesync.

AGI? Or gross income?

&gt; Bill builder pays 37% Fed Income 

According to [this](https://taxna.wolterskluwer.com/whole-ball-of-tax-2019/average-itemized-deductions) someone making more than $250,000 per year will have deductions of approximately $122,347...at the same time Bill Builder probably contributes to his IRA/401k which would lower that taxable income even more, but let's pretend he doesn't save for retirement, isn't married, and has no kids. What do his taxes [look like](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#XyDzZN2DWm)? 

\- $103,224 in Federal

\- FICA $15,323

\- State $23,988

Total tax bill of $142,535 which is a ton of money to most folks, but his income tax bill for the year is 28.5%. 

&gt;  Albany has a State income tax of 8.82 

That, again, is the top marginal rate so you would pay 8.82% on income above above $1 Million so this guy wouldn't qualify. 

I'm assuming you don't honestly know how taxes work, which is ok, but you shouldn't be out here blabbering about things you don't understand. 

&gt; His property tax is 2.08% 

As you mentioned, he's going to pay another $10,415 on his home in property taxes so we are up to $153,000 in taxes and in reality it would be even lower with realistic contributions and deductions.

&gt; in his life at a combined city/state sales tax rate of 8% resulting in a net tax of 55.88%. 

Perhaps you are not aware, but you can deduct other taxes paid. So Bill Builder would have deducted every penny in sales tax, vehicle registration fees, property taxes etc from his income to begin with so you cannot just *add together marginal rate numbers to determine his total tax rate.*

The site I linked to before said that those earning &gt; $250k deduct taxes of $50,000 so using that number combined with his actual income taxes brings us to a total of $193,000 or 38%. 

Your initial figure of 37% of Bill Builder's income is probably pretty accurate. In total. 

&gt; (it's worse if he dies where the rate goes up). 

Say what? 

LMFAO let me guess you think he has to automatically pay X% of his estate to the gov't don't you? 

&gt; That is not counting the 5 types of permits he has to hold to do his job in NY plus the required courses he has to take which all are purchased from the state...(And would be deductible so they aren't included but they still decreased his net pay.) 

No, like you said they would be deducted. Those are the cost of doing business - those have nothing to do with income taxes and are not relevant to this conversation. 

&gt; He uses and receives the same services as the bums panhandling on the subway. 

Does he?

When was the last time the bum on the corner needed a contract enforced? 

When did the bum rely on the Sherrif to ensure that the house he has under construction is protected from thieves and vandals? 

&gt;  He is self-employed in privately funded industry and employs crews numbering about 40 people on a rotating basis after you count framers, carpenters, electricians and plumbers and day-labor plus the money he brings into the economy in the form of sales to all the local business who supply home-building. 

That's awesome. So he's running a multi-million dollar business and I hope building nice houses. 

&gt; What, pray tell, is he getting in return? 

He has a pool of people to hire from that were almost exclusively educated by public dollars.

Him, and his 40 employees, are using the roads 40 times as much as the bum on the corner. 

He has the state/city/county to enforce contracts he makes with subs and with customers. 

&gt; for his $279,400? 

Again, your math doesn't work. 

&gt; Especially given that the McDonald's burger flipper gets exactly the same thing and pays zero. 

The McDonald's flipper still has to pay the same sales tax, property tax, FICA, etc. 

Bill Builder stops contributing to Social Security after his first $120k whereas McDonalds Flipper will contribute a portion of every dollar they earn. 

Assuming the burger flipper works full-time and is in any metro area they are going to make $20k+/yr so the same site has their total income taxes at $3,722 on $24,000 in income. 

&gt; The original statement is that America is..""shit for health care and education and social safety nets and the bulk of Europe is far more desirable a place to live 

I never saw that statement, I simply was correcting whoever claimed that average folks pay 60% in taxes. 

&gt; And the original poster seems oblivious to the fact that the U.S. pays taxes at all, and in some cases comparable to European rates. 

I've never seen a situation where we paid comparable taxes, but if you add in the cost of our healthcare then I'm sure you can find countries where you get a lot more for the same percentage of your income. 

That isn't a tax issue, in my opinion, as much as it is that our healthcare system is super inefficient and designed to make money, not heal the sick. 

&gt; .""Both places pay taxes. There are states in the U.S. where \~60% of your income goes to taxes."" 

But that statement is still utter bullshit. In order to get anywhere near 60% of your income you would have to be literally making millions, be stupid with your finances, and be an absolute edge case of a hypothetical scenario. 

In reality, the wealthy in this country often pay similar tax percentages as you and I do --- that is the fact. The system is rigged in favor of the investor class at the cost of the labor class. 

Imagine a scenario where you make $80k/yr in Albany and are paying an effective rate of 26% on your income taxes while someone making $25M in ""business deals"" can pay 14% on their income.

A giant google/wikipedia rabbit hole. I learned that the rhyme or story or whatever you’d call it was written by a Rabbi but because Jews would not be published, he found someone willing to publish it under his own name. The original story was distorted by the rabbi to allay suspicion. For example he used pigs (which are unclean in the Jewish religion) instead of a more common animal used to refer to Jews like sheep. But the story was a warning to younger Jews to hold to the teachings of their elders and tradition rather than taking shortcuts to wealth like living among non-Jews and hiding their heritage. It is very strongly taught that Jews must live separate and follow tradition in order to enjoy protection from God. Mixing in with other nations and people was separation from God. The weaker building materials representing the shortcuts and the exposure to the wolf. The bricks representing being true to heritage. In the original story, the wolf ate the compromising piggies. In later renditions, they fled to the safety of their brothers. Both hold true to the intention if you think about it.  But anyway, from there I wanted to know why and how far back Jews were treated with hostility and suspicion. Which lead to like 5 hours of finding information leading to information.  One of the things that I learned was that Jews followed a strict set of hygiene rules which were required to be “clean” and allowed to live in the community. Anyone who was for whatever reason “unclean” were required to live on the outskirts of the community for a prescribed period of time.  Because of this, the Jews who separated themselves as per their tradition were largely untouched when the Black Plague raged through Europe in the Middle Ages. Instead of looking at why the Jews were not being infected and maybe even copying them, most of Europe persecuted them. They accused them of witchcraft, then tortured and murdered them. In an effort to save people and to make their hygiene rules more common, the Jews, who didn’t choose to move as far away from the morons as possible and hide, started folklore style stories of cleanliness and food safety. It was the only way for them to be heard without people immediately dismissing them as a whole people for the charges of witchcraft being brought against the uninfected communities.   
Obviously not all folklore stories are from the Jews, some are absurd versions of real stories designed to keep them from being forgotten after talking about what happened was declared treasonous. Like the Pied Piper. That is the story of a dude (German I think but don’t hold me to it) who decided he had heard personally from God and that if he led an army of literally children to the holy land, he would single handedly end whatever particular stage of the crusades that was responsible for the loss of insane numbers of young men. People were so desperate for the war to end, they were being taxed to pay for it and we are talking about villagers and surfs who were already literally dirt poor. They were so desperate that they sent their children with him voluntarily.  He traveled with his child army through European towns and cities preaching his message and people believed him. Not only did he never reach the holy lands, but he and the children given to him died of starvation and disease on the way down. I don’t remember well enough to be more specific, but once people realized how stupid they had been they vilified him. Obviously. But they didn’t take responsibility for their stupidity and the leaders who had found out what was going on and did nothing wanted to hide what they had allowed to happen so it was heretical to even talk about it. Then the rhyme was written and it evolved heavily depending on where it was told into what we have today. That was another rabbit hole. Omg. 
But anyway, if you’re interested in specifics and such you’ll have to go down the rabbit hole I went down. Lol my best sources of information were websites of Jewish history. With the Internet, anything you question can be verified. Sometimes there is inconclusive information, but it doesn’t take much critical thinking to piece it together.

These claims are based on reports made by the American Association of Pediatrics. [**But there is a lot of criticism regarding their research.**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796) The important points are mentioned below:

* **It takes around 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI, and UTIs can be treated easily by other less invasive ways, like antibiotics. Not to mention, it is easily prevented with basic hygiene. 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of haemorrhage, infection, or, in [rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death.](http://www.cirp.org/library/death/)** This negates whatever minuscule protective benefit circumcision might have against UTIs. And it should be noted that girls are about 10 times more likely to get UTIs and yet we do not alter their bodies to reduce their risk of infection
* **Penile cancer** is one of the rarest forms of cancer in the Western world **(∼1 case in 100,000 men per year, rarer than male breast cancer)**, almost always occurring at a later age with the average being 68. When diagnosed early, the disease generally has a good survival rate. According to the AAP report, between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer. [Penile cancer is linked to infection with HPV, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic inoculation.](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/) **Incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised**
* **The studies that claim circumcision prevents STDs often confuse correlation with causation.** [In fact, circumcision might increase the risk of contracting STDs](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/alleged-medical-benefits/sexually-transmitted-infections/), because it can cause pain and bleeding, increasing the risk of infection. The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for any STD

Another common claim is that circumcision reduces the risk of men contracting **HIV** by 60%. These were the results of some trials done in Africa, which found that **2.5% of intact men and 1.3% of circumcised men got HIV.** The 60% figure is the **relative risk** (2.5%-1.2%)÷2.5%. The AAP also ignored the statistics showing that there was a 61% relative increase (6% absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men. It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed

Moreover, there were several methodological errors in these trials:

* The circumcised experimental group got more medical care, including education on the proper use of condoms
* The trials were terminated early when statistical significance was reached
* In one study, circumcised men's infection rates were increasing faster than the intact men's, until the study was terminated early
* The circumcised group could not have sex for 4-6 weeks after the circumcision; this was excluded from the analysis and distorts the results
* HIV was contracted through means other than sex
* Many researchers had cultural and religious biases

The findings are also not in line with the fact that **the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with high circumcision rates. The situation in most European countries is the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates.** Therefore, other factors play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This also shows that there are alternate, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs

Further criticism of the African RCTs:

[Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278023840_Critique_of_African_RCTs_into_Male_Circumcision_and_HIV_Sexual_Transmission)

[Circumcision of male infants and children as a public health measure in developed countries: A critical assessment of recent evidence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441692.2016.1184292#)

[Sexually Transmitted Infections and Male Circumcision: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/109846/)

Even if circumcision did reduce rates of HIV transmission, which it doesn't, it would be a small reduction. [“The number needed to \[circumcise\] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298. The model did not account for the cost of complications of circumcision. In addition, there is a risk that men may overestimate the protective effect of being circumcised and be less likely to adopt safe sex practices.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

And besides all of that, **babies are not having sex.** They are not transmitting **ANY** STDs to anyone. By the time a person is old enough to engage in sexual activities, they are old enough to decide about such body modifications for themselves

**Balanitis** is extremely rare. Having a surgical incision in a dirty diaper increases the risk of balanitis. This risk decreases in all males drastically after puberty. It is easily preventable with good hygiene and most cases respond to treatment in under a week

**Phimosis** doesn't warrant circumcision. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, steroid creams can also be used. If stretching doesn't work, surgery like Z-plasty and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments results in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis

[""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow\[ing\] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

**Smegma and hygiene** are ridiculous reasons for circumcision. Properly washing the penis is enough. If you don't wash your junk, it will get dirty, period. Foreskins aren't releasing a constant ooze of smegma. You would have to neglect your basic hygiene for some time to get a significant buildup. And even then, washing takes maybe a second or two. It's not rocket science

**The legitimacy of research supporting circumcision**

The literature review by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which supports circumcision, does not mention any of the functions of the foreskin, implying that it is useless

Ethicist Brian Earp [shows how scientific literature can be filled with bias,](https://quillette.com/2016/02/15/the-unbearable-asymmetry-of-bullshit/) how [medical literature can get biased with controversial opinions disguised as systematic reviews,](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1078529309478838272.html) and [how a small group of researchers with an agenda can rig a systematic review in medicine to make it say whatever they want.](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1079164114784714752.html)

**Opposition to circumcision by foreign medical organizations**

Other medical associations and doctors in the world, from [the Netherlands](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf), [Canada](https://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision), [the United Kingdom](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/children-and-young-people/male-circumcision), [Australia and New Zealand](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-of-infant-males.pdf), [Germany](http://arclaw.org/sites/default/files/BVKJ_Statement_Official_Translation.pdf), Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Slovenia and South Africa have stated that circumcision causes complications, have also said that the evidence supporting circumcision is insufficient and flawed, and consider the AAP's views scientifically unsound. Some of them have gone on record in opposition to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys. Some doctors in the US oppose it too

**Functions of the Foreskin** 

[The foreskin has several unique physiological functions.](https://youtu.be/D_dzeDvx2QA) The foreskin represents at least a third of the penile skin. It protects the glans from abrasion and contact with clothes. It also increases sexual pleasure by sliding up and down on the shaft, stimulating the glans by alternately covering and exposing it. Not to mention that it is [highly erogenous tissue in and of itself.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif)

**Attempts to legitimize FGM**

Another issue with using ""health benefits"" to justify infant male circumcision is that the same poor reasons given for baby boys are the same reasons being used [in attempts to legalize and legitimize FGM on girls](https://youtu.be/GBH0g_Cl7Rk). They will try and use the logic that: ""If it is legal on boys because there are slight medical benefits, then it should be legal and acceptable for girls as well.""",True,False,False,,,0,1585866869,,False,0,{},fm9e47e,False,t3_ftvb7d,False,False,t3_ftvb7d,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ftvb7d/anticircumcision_people_are_the_most_laughably/fm9e47e/,False,,1592904973,157,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,,1,[],

Is it though? They've still made progress from last season and have made changes, which is why they're top and not third.

&gt;Most teams cant bring in the likes of Krovinovic and Pereira though, or get Diangana on loan 

To be honest I don't think it was that difficult. Krovi was coming off a huge injury layoff and Benfica wanted him to get games, that's why it took him half a season to bed in. As for Pereira, Sporting were desperate to get rid of him for some reason and we were the only team interested in signing him so I don't think it was that difficult. Diangana was a bit surprising and no doubt Bilic's West Ham knowledge helped us out with that one but West Ham weren't planning on using him and several Championship sides enquired about him. The only loanee that no other team aside from Leeds would have been able to bring in was Robinson, and that was more to do with us being in the top two.

&gt;Would you really put yourself out of the top 2 squads? 

No, not at this stage of the season in hindsight. Aside from Watkins/Mitrovic and Brice Samba there's nobody else in the league that I'd say would walk in our team. The thing is though barely anyone thought we'd finish in the automatics at the start of the season; Fulham were favourites for obvious reasons, Leeds finished above us and Cardiff had Colin yet Leeds aside we've been untroubled for the automatics even when we had that shocking run around New Years.

&gt;Maybe its the bias of the games of yours ive watched, inckuding the 1-1 at yours. 

Yes, we were poor that day and Brentford looked good. We outplayed Leeds twice this season though and the fact that we only have one point to show for it is mind boggling to me. We twatted Swansea at home when they had the best away record at the time, a 7-1 aggregate margin over Bristol City is frankly flattering Lee Johnson, we beat Preston at home when they were unbeaten (albeit fortunately) before thrashing them at our place and we went Millwall who have a solid home record and were in good form and put them to the sword. That's not to mention the way we completely battered a full strength West Ham at their place with our reserves and being down to 10 men for most of the second half.

&gt;They say it was all working nicely in the 6th place season, but when it came to evolving the team tactically, he couldnt do it. 

That's consistently been Bielsa's biggest criticism in Europe as well though, this is the first season in Europe that he's managed to overturn a result rut. He led a very good Athletic side that he took to a European final the season before to 12th and was let go, he completely failed to stop the results rut at Marseille after he'd been found out there as well as losing both cup games that season and at Lille they got dumped out of the Europa League by some random Azerbaijani team IIRC before losing 9 of 13 games in the league.",True,False,False,,,1,1585867899,,False,0,{},fm9fvyd,False,t3_ftufgx,False,True,t1_fm9am7g,/r/Championship/comments/ftufgx/who_will_do_the_best_in_the_premier_league_next/fm9fvyd/,False,,1592905820,3,True,False,Championship,t5_2t0f0,r/Championship,public,,0,[],

I'll add quickly some factual arguments here. I wanted to show that a letter fancily signed by politicians can easily make its way to the top and deceive thousands and thousands very quickly. Some facts:

-	FIDESZ had the highest percentage of votes among all EPP member parties (with all time record turnout in Hungary in 2019), 
-	that the 'big guys' (CDU-CSU, PO-PSL, etc) do not support expulsion of Orbán's FIDESZ as we see here, 
-	that the parties for the expulsion form only a smaller minority,
-	that FIDESZ with its 1,824,220 votes equals to 4.49% in EPP group by the votes received while Hungary's population is only 2.20% of the EU's.",True,False,False,,,0,1585868826,,1585871384,2,"{'gid_1': 2, 'gid_2': 2}",fm9hgwk,False,t3_ftp1to,False,False,t1_fm8k988,/r/europe/comments/ftp1to/13_parties_of_the_epp_write_to_epp_president_tusk/fm9hgwk/,False,,1592906571,394,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,,5,[],

I really don't care if America gets shit, because it brings attention to real issues that need to be resolved. That's it, that's the point. Every nation on the planet has issues and steps should be taken to work towards fixing them. Ironically enough, is practically every issue you are concerned about with the American system has been exposed by American journalists trying to bring attention to a system that needs to be fixed.

And no, you don't need to go back 75 years to illustrate the point. I was trying to show you how bad things were in Europe, things my grandmother is young enough to have lived through and remember. If you go back 75 years, you get some of the most legitimately evil regimes that have ever walked the planet... in Europe. Regimes that the US has never even come close to being as bad as. Funnily enough, the biggest stain in American history is the slaughter of the Native Americans, which ironically enough was done by the Spanish and other European settlers.

[As many as 90% of natives were wiped out by European conquest and disease](https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html)

But let's not discuss the past, because in your mind it doesn't count, and there's plenty of current issues. Because the point being, Europeans didn't evolve into another species of human that just solved the problems of human nature, you can really see the same problems every where if you pay attention. The point isn't that the US is better, its that the US and Europe are facing similar issues.

One of my driving instructors once had no idea how to drive an automatic car. Our dialogue went like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Instructor: Wait, so the gas pedal is controlled by the right foot, right?

Me: That is correct.

Instructor: And the brakes...also with the right foot?

Me: That is correct.

Instructor: Oh, so just like in a manual car.

Me: Exactly.

Instructor: And the left foot, does nothing?

Me: No. And in fact, there is a foot rest right here, exactly meant for when your left foot does nothing.

Instructor: And your left hand goes on the steering wheel. What about your right?

Me: Also on the steering wheel.

Instructor: Oh yes, of course! Because you see, I'm a very fidgety person and I need all my limbs to be doing something at all times. (r/Thathappened)

I thought to myself ""well, just go to a gym!"" I didn't say that, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Trust me, automatic cars never stall and you feel enough like you are driving. I'll admit, manual looks cool, but automatic is a lot more simple. Never got why here in Europe, automatic cars are more expensive than manual cars.

Also, I later learnt that the foot rest is actually called a ""dead pedal"" and has a much more important purpose: to be used as a reference to the driver to know where the front left wheel is in relation to the car.

\- Get used, make sure it's passed by a mechanic of your choice

\- Get it preferably from a private party on CL 

\- Make sure it FITS ALL YOUR needs and can haul whatever you want to haul (for ex. dont buy a smart car when you have bikes or not to haul) cuz it wont meet your needs, you'll regret your purchase and have to sell at a loss and waste time &amp; energy shopping for another vehicle

\- Make sure as best as possible it's got a recent clutch (for manual transmission) change, tires are at least 50% or more (of cuz the higher the better), engine mounts replaced (if too old or high mileage like more than 120k miles or more than 7/8 years old), timing belts done (if applicable again more than 100k miles and more than 7/8 yrs old), head gaskets replaced (for models that tend to fail), brake &amp; brake rotors have sufficient life (the mechanic should be able to tell you). 

\- Look at carcomplaints to get an idea of what potential problems you might face and google for how much it will cost to fix

\- Buy if you feel comfortable, cognizant of the above bullet points 

&amp;#x200B;

**What brands to stay away from**

\- Anything turbo charged/AWD will tend to have more maintenance requirements down the line (they will usually require premium gas which cost more)

\- Parts for european cars tend to be more expensive

\- I'd tell you to look at Mazda/Honda/Toyota/Mitsubishi/Nissan? for reliability, better MPGs. That is just a generalization. There will be exceptions - I had a V6 Honda Accord 07 and the transmission died at 70k+ miles. So just take note that there are lots of V6 Hondas &amp; Acuras that are affected as they use the same transmission. TL;DR - Don't buy a used honda/acura with a v6 engine (Odyssey/MDX/Accord/Pilot/TL) since they usually have auto transmission issues down the line. 

\- Subarus 2.5L NA engines prior to 2012 IIRC - famous for head gasket issues, please make sure they have been replaced prior to buying if the car has a relatively high mileage.

\- If getting hybrids, please make sure you're still covered by the warranty cuz the replacement cost if the battery goes south is really high

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get the lowest insurance rates**

\- Compose 1 email, send it to as many auto insurance agents as you can find with your details, insurance requirements and car you would like to buy. 

\- Wait for replies and compare pricing given all should provide you your stated requirements

\- Oh yeah garaging zip code is important -&gt; park it (if you have to) in a zip code where there's lower crime or is safer (think in terms of good schools as a generalization)

É um caroço de ácido nucleico e proteína que nem sequer está totalmente vivo: é como o zumbi dos agentes infecciosos. E essa ninharia derrubou o planeta. A humildade deve ser nosso primeiro aprendizado.

 Às vezes, sobretudo quando jovem, quando ainda ignorava muito de mim mesma, eu me perguntava [como teria reagido em certas situações históricas críticas](//brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-30/um-mundo-em-quarentena-busca-saidas-para-a-crise.html). Na [Alemanha nazista](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/10/06/opinion/1538852257_174248.html), por exemplo: teria sido capaz de esconder um judeu, com o perigo que isso representava? Pois bem, agora estamos enfrentando nossa circunstância crítica. É uma prova tremenda, inesperada. É a nossa prova. O resto de nossos dias ficará marcado pelo que fizemos ou não fizemos, pela forma como nos comportamos nesta anomalia colossal.

 Falo desses descerebrados, nada solidários, que se foram a abarrotar e infectar praias como se estivessem de férias (a propósito: eram uma minoria da população de [Madri](//brasil.elpais.com/noticias/madrid/); cair no estereótipo do ódio ao madrilenho é outra atitude descerebrada); esses garotos ignorantes que brincam de burlar a autoridade e se reúnem nos apartamentos dos amigos (vocês são potenciais assassinos); esses espertalhões egoístas que esvaziam os supermercados; esses canalhas que se disfarçam de médicos para entrar nas casas para roubar. Ou esses miseráveis que criam [notícias falsas](//brasil.elpais.com/noticias/noticias-falsas/) sobre a Covid (acabo de escutar o áudio de uma suposta doutora despejando torrentes de dados mentirosos para justificar que devemos abandonar o isolamento). Todos esses indivíduos, em suma, cada um na sua medida, escolheram passar à história, sua própria história e memória, como uns porcos.

 Mas não me refiro apenas à esfera social. O maior desafio é o interior. Como viver a vida quando você fica sem truques defensivos ou disfarces? A vida crua e limpa no lento e incandescente tempo da peste. Entre os piadas maravilhosas e reconfortantes que circulam nas redes ([bendita tecnologia que nos une)](//brasil.elpais.com/noticias/redes-sociales/), recebi esta: ""Uma amiga diz que, com este isolamento em casa, tem conversado um bom tempo com o marido e o achou muito simpático"".

 Esta é a questão: tentemos achar-nos simpáticos. Ou tentemos simplesmente nos achar. Quando o barulho e o movimento incessante param, fica o real. Aguentar semanas com crianças que você costuma encostar em algum lugar. Conviver de verdade com o seu companheiro em um espaço estreito e aprender não só a escutá-lo, mas também a respeitar sua ausência na presença. Suportar a sua solidão, se você mora sozinho, e conseguir se sentir confortável nela. E, acima de tudo, gerenciar bem o tempo. Em vez de perdê-lo, queimá-lo, jogá-lo fora (a vida é isso que acontece enquanto nos ocupamos com outra coisa, de acordo com uma suposta frase de [John Lennon](//brasil.elpais.com/noticias/john_lennon)), como fazíamos na agitação da *normalidade*, agora temos uma oportunidade única para habitar o presente. Para preencher de consciência e vontade cada minuto. Para discernir entre o essencial e o supérfluo.

Além disso, elas atuam com base em arcabouços legais que dão maior ou menos margem de manobra. 

Portanto, uma explicação é que as medidas que facilitaram ao setor financeiro emprestar dinheiro para ajudar a população a enfrentar essa bronca (porque foi isso, nada desse dinheiro foi “dado” para os bancos) saíram da autoridade que conseguiu implementar rápido. Obviamente você vai concordar que não faz sentido as autarquias que conseguem entregar as medidas para sua caixinha esperarem até todos os outros N órgãos do governo completarem a missão pra aí implementar.

Outra explicação é que, sabendo que o setor financeiro está com liquidez e disponibilidade pra emprestar, isso ajuda empresários e as pessoas indiretamente, pois eles sabem que se o bicho pegar, tem uma chance grande de eles conseguirem crédito para passar por esse período.

Ainda outra explicação é que distribuir dinheiro diretamente para a população é algo que eu imagino ser extremamente complicado do ponto de vista operacional. Muita gente não tem nem mesmo conta em banco. Muita gente não tem nem endereço. Muita gente vive em situação muito mais precária que nós e não faz sentido eles ficarem de fora.

Detalhe: não estou defendendo ninguém, governo ou fora. Estou apenas apresentando várias razões bastante razoáveis pelas quais a liquidez para os bancos emprestarem às pessoas e as empresas conseguiu ser implementada antes de outras medidas, como essa citada.

""Cholo"" is indeed a word: it means someone of mixed blood, with european and native parents/ancestors: https://dle.rae.es/?w=cholo

In Spanish, the word ""negro"" does not entail so many racial connotations as in English, although it may sometimes. To refer to a black person, you can use ""negro"" and it won't be offensive as long as you are just using it without any double meaning, to describe their race.

Yes, ""pa qué"" is ""por qué"" in colloquial speech.

The ""interviewer"" asks: ¿Tú que preferirías: un negro, un cholo, un indio o un colorao? Basically asking for their racial preference on something (we don't know what, although the tone of the question and the subsequent response make it very clear). ""Colorado"" means ""of a reddish colour"", and in some parts of Andalucía is directly a synonym for ""red"", but in Domincan Republic apparently it means ""tanned"", so I'm guessing that's the meaning here.

It says:

¿Pa qué? Pa que me **desbarate**. ""desbaratar"" means something akin to ""ruin"" or ""undo"", so you can imagine what they mean with that.

¿Pa qué? Pa que me **dé con el bate**. ""So that he hits me with the bat"". Again, you can clearly imagine what the wooden bat is representing here.

Segundo ele, pode-se ampliar o número de profissões que voltarão a atuar normalmente durante a **quarentena**. Ele também pediu aos governadores que ""revissem suas posições"" no combate ao novo coronavírus.

- Eu tenho um decreto pronto para assinar na minha frente, se eu quiser assinar, considerando ampliar as categorias que são indispensáveis para a economia. Eu, como chefe de Estado, tenho que decidir. Se chegar o momento, vou assinar a MP. Tem ameaça de todo lugar se eu assinar essa medida - disse, em entrevista a rádio Jovem Pan, na noite desta quinta-feira.

Eu apelo aos governadores e prefeitos que revejam as suas posições.

Questionado sobre o motivo de não ter ainda assinado o decreto para reabrir o comércio, Bolsonaro respondeu que ""um presidente pode muito, mas não pode tudo"", e que está ""esperando o povo pedir mais"".

- Nós temos ali gente poderosa em Brasília que espera um tropeção meu. Eu estou esperando o povo pedir mais. O que eu tenho de base de apoio são alguns parlamentares, não são maioria, mas o povo está do meu lado. Tem que ser responsável. O que muitos governadores mais querem é que eu tome a decisão para trazer o problema para o meu colo, e se tiver alguma morte, me crucificar. Na semana que vem, se não voltar o comércio, eu vou ter que tomar uma decisão. Seja o que o povo quiser.

 Bolsonaro voltou a alimentar a batalha com os governadores, em especial o de São Paulo, João Doria (PSDB), e do Rio de Janeiro, Wilson Witzel (PSC). Afirmou que os governadores fazem um ""trabalho irresponsável"" e sugeriu que agem com motivações políticas para tirá-lo do cargo.

- Primeiro, com todo o respeito aos governadores, vocês estão muito mal de porta-voz. Ele porta-voz que vocês elegeram aí é muito ruim em todos os aspectos, vocês sabem quem é. Faz demagogia barata o tempo todo, que é o (governador) de São Paulo. Agora não venha esse porta-voz de discursinho barato, ginasial, falando que o governo tem dinheiro, que tem a Casa Moeda para rodar. Se rodar a moeda, vem a inflação. Nós não queremos o caos no Brasil.

Em seguida, partiu para cima de Witzel. Bolsonaro criticou recentes declarações do governador pedindo que a população não saísse às ruas.

- Agora, não podem alguns governadores, como o do Rio de Janeiro, na televisão falando: Fiquem em casa, é uma ordem. Está pensando que é o quê? É ditadura esse negócio aqui, pô?

&gt;  I remember the people who said this was just the flu, that people are overreacting, or the government is overexerting it’s power etc where usually more right wing. 

There was common underestimation sure, but not abnormal given that we've had SARS and MERS and H1N1 before and all of them were either easy to control (SARS), not affecting the west (MERS) or basically harmless (H1N1)

China had a chance to warn that this one was different when they noticed it was. They didn't.

There were plenty that thought Trump's China travel ban in January was just racially motivated. It probably was the only correct move Trump made in the entire ordeal.

Hell, the WHO itself advised against such measures at that time and therefore has blood on their hands.

Eu já vi esse vídeo e o Sr. Baboo não está errado em dizer que ativadores podem inserir malwares em seu computador, pois, você está dando acesso de administrador para um programa de origem duvidosa acessar qualquer pasta e arquivo do mesmo. 

Porém, nem todo o [método de ""ativação""](https://gearchunk.com/activate-windows-10/) do Windows hoje é tão intrusivo. O que um ativador faz no campo do acesso nada mais é que inserir uma chave ""fake"" dentro do Windows e mudar o caminho pelo qual o sistema busca a ativação, levando para muitas vezes um servidor local com a chave de confirmação, fazendo o sistema entender que foi ativado corretamente. 

Existe, também a possibilidade de se ""[comprar](https://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-1486578770-windows-10-pro-key-original-entrega-imediata-_JM)"" (lê-se receptar, mas quem liga?) uma senha OEM da Microsoft vendida por valores pífios no Mercado Livre e afins.

Eu mesmo uso uma senha dessas em meu Windows 10 Pro (só porque falei que pode não ser certo, não significa que eu não use). E eu estou totalmente ciente das consequências de se usar uma senha dessas. Mas, sinceramente, mesmo usando a mesma chave OEM há três anos já sem nenhum problema, caso a mesma deixe de funcionar por problemas com o partner de quem eu comprei, basta gastar mais 10 Reais no seu site favorito de muambas e utilizar por mais um tempo X indeterminado.

This is study that is based on non-Italian data, which demonstrates that the mortality is likely much higher than predicted. Because most often individuals are comparing the number of deaths against the number of currently infected. However, it takes time for people to die. So it’s more accurate to compare the dead vs the infected two weeks ago. This study from the lancet further takes into account the likelihood that the number of infected is probably double the official numbers ( due to asymptomatic cases) and produces a mortality rate of 5.6% with a 95% CI of 5.4-5.8%.

Looking at real world history, there are have been many cultures where clothing was minimal.  This is especially true when people are doing hard physical and fighting in particular.   There are tribes across Europe (Germany, Gaul and Britain) who were reported by the Romans to have fought in little or no clothing.   There is also no shortage of artwork from ancient Greece depicting athletes and warriors either naked or wearing minimal armor and nothing covering their genitals.  This does not even get into the native warriors of areas like Africa, Australia and America.

There's an interesting case study on this, I'll link it in an edit if I can find it, where they took one picture of a family sitting around. Westerners saw them as inside a room, under a window. The global south tended to interpret it as under a tree, with one woman that had a box on her head.


Neither answer was inherently wrong, of course. It all came down to spacial reasoning and where people would most likely see a similar situation. People in Africa don't tend to socialize inside as much as we do.


This is perfectly analogous to the modern IQ test, because it's all based on very subjective spacial reasoning. When people are specially socialized in completely different ways than the white westerners that make the test, they tend to perform worse.


This is why even on one continent, Northern and Western Africa, with more European influence in their culture and education, tends to perform better than southern Africa. Their schooling is more designed to match eurocentric quality standards.

Similarly, China outperforms the rest of Asia, simply because of their cultural and educational reforms of the 80s, and their extremely rigorous system. It has nothing to do with ethnicity.

But here's some paraphrased highlights with a couple actual quotes (sorry for any mistakes):

* **Khabib still wants to fight Tony April 18th, or August or September** (San Francisco, Abu Dhabi) once this dies down. Ramadan ends late May, he needs June and July to be ready for August.

* **He still truly believes they're gonna fight, and texts Dana every day asking for a lokation. Okamoto asks him if Dana gave him one today, would he still fight April 18 and Khabib says 100%**

* Okamoto asks him if he'd fight Tony in the fall or if there's a chance he'd fight Conor. He emphasizes Tony, calls it his dream fight.

* He repeatedly bemoans the lack of lokation, calls it ""not professional"", especially for such a big fight, for one of their biggest superstars, just 16 days out.

* He recaps his timeline:

    * he's been training for this fight since December

    * he was training at AKA for 40 days when police came and shut them down, saying even small groups can't train.

    * he group texted Dana and Ali telling them he was leaving the US. Dana told him 99% chance the fight would be in Abu Dhabi.

    * he flew to Dubai on March 17th or 18th at 8pm. He says the UAE had locked down at midnight and wouldn't let him in.

    * he stayed in an airport hotel for 23 hours, then flew to Moscow, then to Dagestan

    * he has a gym in his home and is still training

* Okamoto asks him if he ever considered flying back to the US instead of Dagestan, Khabib says why would he and makes several points:

    * the March 28 and April 11 (and actually the March 21 as well) events in the US were cancelled

    * their April 18 event in NYC was canceled (Okamoto points out NYC is now the epicenter in the US)

    * he thinks it's unlikely the fight happens in the US, so why should he go there? (plus as already pointed out, he couldn't even train there)

* Okamoto asks about rumors about taking a private plane to enter the US. Khabib counters by asking what special treatment did the cops give Jon Jones? **Calls Jon ""one of the greatest fighters of all time... But he is greatest fighter of all time!** Because I am good fighter, I am champion, they have to give me private plane?""

* **Says people are crazy for expecting him and Dana to call up their presidents and get special exceptions made** for them, when thousands of people are dying every day, everything is closed, entire countries are closed, all celebrities are urging people to stay at home.

* He says Moscow is closed and even the big city in Dagestan near his village is closed. He has to stay in his village, but is still training and waiting to hear from Dana.

* When he points out all sports are closed (NBA, NFL, NHL, Olympics, tennis, soccer European championships), he pronounces the H in NHL gutturally (""enn akhell""). Just thought that was a little amusing.

* He emphasizes this is not his mistake (""I am Khabib, I am not coronavirus""), even does a V thing with his fingers to demonstrate these 2 things are separate

* He calls Tony ""stupid guy"" for saying he's running and that he should be stripped. ""Why you hide in US? Come Russia. Same thing."" Points out Tony also said he wouldn't sign a contract without a set location. Says April 2018 was Tony's fault but this April is coronavirus's fault, not Khabib's.

* Okamoto asks him about Tony/Gaethje for an interim title. Khabib laughs and says he wouldn't begrudge Dana for this, he's in a tough spot. Seems unconcerned with an interim title, even says Tony deserves this.

*  **He says while he is in the UFC, Tony's maximum is interim champion and Conor's maximum is number 2.** Fans know who is the best.

* Says the UFC tried to make Conor rematch, ""I tell hey this guy not deserve. Bye bye. **I can make with this chicken 5 time more money than with Tony Ferguson.**""

* He says Conor is very popular but most people (read: ""filthy casuals"") just know names, not skills. **They want to see ""name vs name, not skill vs skills.""** The fans know which is why this is the biggest fight in the UFC right now, a dream fight. 

* He chose Tony over Conor because it is the hard fight, the legacy fight. He wants to fight Tony to show there is no one on his level. ""My ground game, my striking game, my timing, my wrestling, my top control, my spirit, my fighting IQ""

* He says Conor is fake for saying his foot was hurt/he was out of shape when they fought despite having a 6 month camp to get in shape, but now he's in shape while on coronavirus quarantine and making concerned social media videos. Says he had nothing for him even though he stood with him for a whole round.

* **He calls Conor ""an old prostitute who wants attention."" ""His time is done, just tell him.""**

* Okamoto asks him if Khabib would advise Tony to take a Gaethje fight. Khabib doesn't really answer, he just repeats send me lokation and reiterates Tony will always be interim champion and Conor will always be number 2.

* He seems to dismiss Gaethje's chances of beating Tony, since he never acknowledges that possibility and basically only talks about Tony and Conor.

I believe that social media age restrictions are set to 13+ to not break COPPA and GDPR laws. By setting up these age restrictions, asking for a birth date, these laws are not broken. However, the birth date is stupidly easy to lie on, even to the point where my main (parent made) google account's age is 44ish.

The only thing I don’t agree with is the notion of romanticising pre-Islamic past. I get where you’re coming from- it’s definitely a practical way to look at things, and maybe at least partly true. 
But, there is no shame in accepting a failure to fight invading marauding cultures. A civilisation that only has books and no weapons won’t survive long, practically speaking. You need warriors and scholars both.
History has shown the pattern that civilisation comes in ebbs and flows. Indian civilisation had flowed for thousands of years; it had to ebb at some point.
I think the anomaly with Indian civilisation is it didn’t just die away into hieroglyphics of the ancient past like Mesopotamian, Egyptian, ancient Greek and ancient Chinese civilisations did. They were gobbled up by Abrahamic invasion or somehow even worse: Maoism (🤮).

Indian civilisation has a continuous thread, similar to Japanese civilisation, except Japan didn’t have to deal with exclusivist, marauding invasions and basically two waves of colonialism: first Turkic-Persian-Muslim then European. Again, no shame in admitting weaknesses in the Indian kingdoms that could be easily exploited. So many Indian kings and queens were defeated by internal betrayal.
I think the “nostalgia” you see can be attributed in part to an attempt by the so called “Right Wing” to reclaim the Narrative. Congi-JNU government controlled history textbooks have fed a defeatist narrative to our school children, and there is a growing need to reclaim the wins/victories of the past. 
Of course, I agree we can have a more practical lens about it all. Then again, I think dharmic civilisation WAS superior morally because even war had shastras on respecting the enemy as an opponent and giving bodies of fallen enemy soldiers a full ritual funeral.

Inactivated vaccines (1976 swine flu vaccine in the US, and one of the 1009 swine flu vacicnes in the EU) have in the past caused autoimmune disease, even after testing, although these reactions weren't common (eg 1 in 100,000 for the US vaccine)

Some other inactivated vaccines have caused you to basically become allergic to the disease, and get it worse, rather than become immune, including an early version of the SARS vaccine, and one of the first measles vaccines 

Viruses that infect white blood cells (eg dengue) can in some cases use your immune response against you, meaning that immunization could make you more susceptible (COVID-19 doesn't infect white blood cells, so no worries about this with this vaccine)

Live vaccines (which is not what is being proposed to fight COVID-19) can infect you with the disease they are supposed to prevent if not made right, or if you are immune compromised, or, rarely, just by chance, but these vaccines may have additional benefits that outweigh such risks

DTP vaccine could cause brain injury, although this is controversial, this may be because of the pertussis toxin in the vaccine

and lastly, DNA vaccines could theoretically genetically engineer you in some undesirable way, leading to genetic illness in you or your kids

&gt; The Latest on the coronavirus&lt;!-- --&gt; pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

&gt; TOP OF THE HOUR:

&gt; — Asian Development Bank forecasts pandemic will cost world economy as much as $4.1 trillion

&gt; — India’s PM urges citizens to light candles Sunday night to boost morale, spirit

&gt; — South Korea says more than 27,000 people are under self-quarantine

&gt; ___

&gt; MANILA, Philippines — The Asian Development Bank forecasts that the coronavirus pandemic will cost the world economy as much as $4.1 trillion, or nearly 5% of all economic activity. 

&gt; In an update Friday, the regional lender said growth in developing Asia would likely fall to 2.2% in 2020 from 5.2% last year. The Manila, Philippines-based bank said that Southeast Asia, a market of more than 600 million that has been rapidly growing, will likely log 1% growth this year.

&gt; The report said China, the region’s biggest economy, saw double-digit contractions in business activity in January-February and will likely see growth fall to 2.3% this year from a three-decade low of 6.1% in 2019. China, which is trying to get its economy back on track after unprecedented shutdowns in Wuhan, where the virus was first reported, and other parts of the country could suffer losses amounting to up to $692 billion if containment efforts drag on. But the ADB estimated that growth would bounce back next year to more than 7%.

&gt; ___

&gt; NEW DELHI — To bolster morale and spirit, India’s prime minister urges the country’s 1.3 billion people to switch off lights of their home for nine minutes Sunday night and light candles, lamps and even use mobile torches standing in their balconies.

&gt; In a video message broadcast Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said such a gesture will dispel the darkness created by the coronavirus and show that people are together in their fight against the epidemic.

&gt; He said social distancing was the only way to break the chain of coronavirus, which has so far claimed 53 lives in India with 1,860 positive cases.

&gt; Modi ordered a three-week lockdown across the country on March 24 to stop a massive outbreak of coronavirus infections.

&gt; On Friday, he acknowledged the hardships caused by the world’s biggest shutdown to millions of people who have been left jobless and forced tens of thousands of migrants workers to flee to their villages for food and shelter.

&gt; Indian officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence yet of community spread, but have conducted relatively scant testing for the disease in a country where tens of millions live in dense urban areas with irregular access to clean water.

&gt; ___

&gt; SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea says more than 27,000 people are under self-quarantine in the country after it strengthened border controls to slow coronavirus infections linked to international arrivals.

&gt; Park Jong-hyun, an official from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, said Friday that 19,567 of those under self-quarantine have recently returned from overseas while another 7,499 were isolated after contacting virus carriers.

&gt; South Korea has been enforcing 14-day quarantines on all passengers arriving from overseas since Wednesday, expanding measures that had already been applied to South Korean nationals and long-term stay foreigners coming from Europe and the United States.

&gt; Health Ministry official Koh Deuk-young said 266 short-term visitors have so far been quarantined at designated facilities after the quarantines were expanded Wednesday.

&gt; Authorities are isolating and testing passengers arriving with symptoms at airports while denying entry of anyone refusing to accept quarantines or download an app that requires users to report their daily health conditions and alerts officials when they leave their homes or facilities.

Sexism is kind of a dealbreaker if you ask me if the ground idea was equality.

So either these people want more, meaning exclusive rights (which is not equality) or they want to force their specific opinion on people.

The thing is in the western world we already have equality of the sexes in front of the law but that doesn't mean there are people around you that still think different. Let it be questionable if that is good or bad but it is like that. You won't find a country or village or even family where everyone has exactly the same opinion on everything, that's just how it is.


Since they already reached their goal (only speaking for my country) they allocate to what's left and that is forcing the opinion on the rest that thinks otherwise or that is all they want to do because creating actual change needs some effort. Maybe talking is all these people want to do.



Per defintion feminism is the advocacy for women's rights on the grounds of equality of the sexes.

So yes it was originally thought out for women's rights because of the fact that woman in the past had less rights than men, not only in the form of laws but also strong expectations.


But at least where I live in central-europe that is not the case anymore.

Sure some expectations are still there but they are smaller and not as important anymore but in front of the law everyone is the same, so we have equal rights. It's a lot different in some other countries that still desperately need this ideology.



What these type of ""feminists"" like to forget is that there are also still aspects where we should fight for men's rights and make them heard.

For example when men show feelings we view it as weakness or if it comes to violence against men, we have so much stigma in society that a man can not get really hurt or raped by a woman when that's obviously bullshit.

There are next to no shelters for men that need to escape a violent home or are victims of other crimes.

Per capita rates will completely erase the difference between a small country with a significant but contained outbreak and a larger country that is on a disastrous course to total infection, but where only a few outlying regions have been infected so far.

&gt; Mark Eitzel (born January 30, 1959) is best known as lead singer of the San Francisco band american music club.  He was voted Rolling Stone's Songwriter of the Year in 1991.

&gt; Eitzel's first solo album was the (now elusive) cassette-only 'Mean Mark Eitzel Gets Fat' (1982), which pre-dates his AMC work.  He released a solo live album, songs of love live in 1991, featuring raw and emotional acoustic versions of his best AMC songs. His first solo album proper was 1996's 60 Watt Silver Lining, a highly personal, jazz-inflected work.

&gt; He went on to release albums of varying styles and quality, including another difficult-to-find effort in Lover's Leap USA, produced as a tour-only CD and notable for including two songs which Eitzel's own sleeve notes instruct the listener to skip past.  This was followed by 1997's West, a collaboration with REM's Peter Buck, and the stark and harrowing Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much, Baby in 1998.  2001 saw him take a new electronic direction with The Invisible Man, followed in 2002 by two covers projects: Music for courage &amp; confidence and The Ugly American, which included re-interpretations of American Music Club songs by Eitzel and a traditional Greek band!

&gt; american music club reformed in 2003, and released an album, Love Songs for Patriots, as well as touring the United States and Europe. Eitzel released new solo material in 2005, candy ass, which saw a return to the electronic experimentation of the invisible man. A new AMC record, The Golden Age was released in February 2008.
