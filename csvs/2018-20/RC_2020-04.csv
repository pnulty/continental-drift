[],,bbynug,1524515156.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_10irg672,False,False,[],"98% of all residents in Massachusetts are insured. MA has a single payer system that is subsidized for low income folks. Below a certain income you will pay $0 for insurance, prescriptions are a few bucks and you certainly will not pay for an ambulance. Full dental and vision coverage as well. There is substantial coverage for things like mental healthcare for those under 18. MA was the first state to implement a single payer insurance system and its model is what the ACA (Obamacare) and other state systems are based on. Is it perfect? No. But it’s approaching as close to perfect as is possible under the insurance system.  Private hospitals are exceptional in Massachusetts, among the best in the world. And the cost? Well, if you’re insured...which nearly the entire state is...the cost is very affordable.

As for free public schools, that’s K-12 in the US, again, [Massachusetts](http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=24050).  This is the yearly, international [PISA assessment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment). The only country to outperform this state in science scores was Singapore. In Math, the European countries MA was outperformed by were Estonia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. No Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Germany to be found on this list I’m afraid...So weird, right? And in Reading? Massachusetts had the highest test scores *in the world* outperforming not only Finland but Singapore, Japan, Korea and...everyone else. So there you go, there’s a state. Granted, this was from 2016 so perhaps the rankings have fluctuated a bit. 

As for universities, I think you’re aware of some of the universities that exist in Massachusetts so I won’t get into that. Beyond just those school, there are really too many top-ranking universities in the US to list but a Google search should help you out. Are they free? No, definitely not. And that’s certainly a problem that there’s no excuse for. I do know that at Ivy League school, students below a certain income level will get a completely free ride and they have dedicated admission spots for low-income and community college transfer students so there’s that. But I won’t argue that affordable higher education isn’t an issue. 

I am not trying to argue that the US does not have problems. Nor am I going to pretend that one state is representative of the entire country (but you *did* ask for one state so). It isn’t. I won’t argue that European countries, as a whole, are superior in a number of ways. 

But I’m also sick of people on Reddit who have clearly never set foot in the US claiming that it is “literally a third world country” and “a complete shithole” full of uneducated, gun-toting lunatics who worship Trump and who will be tossed out of hospitals and left to die in the streets if they don’t have insurance. 

I’m sick of the glee that people from other countries seem to take in pointing out the problems we have in the US, as if it’s enjoyable to gloat about  having “free” healthcare, as if we don’t already know that and aren’t aware that we don’t have it, as if they’re doing us a great service by pointing it out. Would it be hilarious to constantly point out the [alcoholism death rate](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alcohol/by-country/) in European utopias like Denmark? Or that 47% of Australians are [functionally illiterate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/illiteracy-rates-australias-national-shame)? Germanys atrocious [infrastructure](https://www.theglobalist.com/germany-angela-merkel-government-spending/)? Id the US is truly a third world nation, as so many claim, isn’t it kind of in poor taste to take pleasure in making fun of the problems in developing country? 

I suspect this behavior some sort of “payback” for those Americans who participate in unbridled patriotism.

Dacă nu ți-ai găsit oamenii care să te înțeleagă și accepte, asta nu înseamnă că ei nu există sau că cei care sunt acum în viața ta au dreptate.

Ce încerc să spun este că nu trebuie să lași oamenii din jur să determine cine ești tu. Dacă ești împăcat cu tine și încerci să fii o persoană cât mai bună, lucrurile bune își vor găsi drumul către tine. Important este, cum spuneam din start, să nu stai supărat, cu mâinile în sân.

Ăsta e primul pas: propune-ți un proiect - care să dureze măcar vreo două săptămâni, să zicem - și vezi cum merge. Dacă ești absolut sigur că nu te atrage, caută altceva. Dacă nu, termină proiectul, cere niște feedback eventual și caută apoi ceva mai complicat de făcut.

&gt; Dear Chancellor,

&gt; As Emeritus of the Johannes-Gutenberg-University in Mainz and longtime director of the Institute for Medical Microbiology, I feel obliged to critically question the far-reaching restrictions on public life that we are currently taking on ourselves in order to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

&gt; It is expressly not my intention to play down the dangers of the virus or to spread a political message. However, I feel it is my duty to make a scientific contribution to putting the current data and facts into perspective – and, in addition, to ask questions that are in danger of being lost in the heated debate.

&gt; The reason for my concern lies above all in the truly unforeseeable socio-economic consequences of the drastic containment measures which are currently being applied in large parts of Europe and which are also already being practiced on a large scale in Germany.

&gt; My wish is to discuss critically – and with the necessary foresight – the advantages and disadvantages of restricting public life and the resulting long-term effects.

&gt; To this end, I am confronted with five questions which have not been answered sufficiently so far, but which are indispensable for a balanced analysis.

&gt; I would like to ask you to comment quickly and, at the same time, appeal to the Federal Government to develop strategies that effectively protect risk groups without restricting public life across the board and sow the seeds for an even more intensive polarization of society than is already taking place.

&gt; With the utmost respect,

&gt; Prof. em. Dr. med. Sucharit Bhakdi

&gt; 1. Statistics
&gt; In infectiology – founded by Robert Koch himself – a traditional distinction is made between infection and disease. An illness requires a clinical manifestation. Therefore, only patients with symptoms such as fever or cough should be included in the statistics as new cases.

&gt; In other words, a new infection – as measured by the COVID-19 test – does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with a newly ill patient who needs a hospital bed. However, it is currently assumed that five percent of all infected people become seriously ill and require ventilation. Projections based on this estimate suggest that the healthcare system could be overburdened.

&gt; My question: Did the projections make a distinction between symptom-free infected people and actual, sick patients – i.e. people who develop symptoms?

&gt; 2. Dangerousness
A number of coronaviruses have been circulating for a long time – largely unnoticed by the media. If it should turn out that the COVID-19 virus should not be ascribed a significantly higher risk potential than the already circulating corona viruses, all countermeasures would obviously become unnecessary.

&gt; The internationally recognized International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents will soon publish a paper that addresses exactly this question. Preliminary results of the study can already be seen today and lead to the conclusion that the new virus is NOT different from traditional corona viruses in terms of dangerousness. The authors express this in the title of their paper „SARS-CoV-2: Fear versus Data“. 

&gt; My question: How does the current workload of intensive care units with patients with diagnosed COVID-19 compare to other coronavirus infections, and to what extent will this data be taken into account in further decision-making by the federal government? In addition: Has the above study been taken into account in the planning so far?  Here too, of course, „diagnosed“ means that the virus plays a decisive role in the patient’s state of illness, and not that previous illnesses play a greater role.

&gt; 3. Dissemination
According to a report in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, not even the much-cited Robert Koch Institute knows exactly how much is tested for COVID-19. It is a fact, however, that a rapid increase in the number of cases has recently been observed in Germany as the volume of tests increases. 

&gt; It is therefore reasonable to suspect that the virus has already spread unnoticed in the healthy population. This would have two consequences: firstly, it would mean that the official death rate – on 26 March 2020, for example, there were 206 deaths from around 37,300 infections, or 0.55 percent – is too high; and secondly, it would mean that it would hardly be possible to prevent the virus from spreading in the healthy population.

&gt; My question: Has there already been a random sample of the healthy general population to validate the real spread of the virus, or is this planned in the near future?

&gt; 4. Mortality
The fear of a rise in the death rate in Germany (currently 0.55 percent) is currently the subject of particularly intense media attention. Many people are worried that it could shoot up like in Italy (10 percent) and Spain (7 percent) if action is not taken in time.

&gt; At the same time, the mistake is being made worldwide to report virus-related deaths as soon as it is established that the virus was present at the time of death – regardless of other factors. This violates a basic principle of infectiology: only when it is certain that an agent has played a significant role in the disease or death may a diagnosis be made. The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies of Germany expressly writes in its guidelines: „In addition to the cause of death, a causal chain must be stated, with the corresponding underlying disease in third place on the death certificate. Occasionally, four-linked causal chains must also be stated.“ 

&gt; At present there is no official information on whether, at least in retrospect, more critical analyses of medical records have been undertaken to determine how many deaths were actually caused by the virus.

&gt; My question: Has Germany simply followed this trend of a COVID-19 general suspicion? And: is it intended to continue this categorisation uncritically as in other countries? How, then, is a distinction to be made between genuine corona-related deaths and accidental virus presence at the time of death?

&gt; 5. Comparability
The appalling situation in Italy is repeatedly used as a reference scenario. However, the true role of the virus in that country is completely unclear for many reasons – not only because points 3 and 4 above also apply here, but also because exceptional external factors exist which make these regions particularly vulnerable.

&gt; One of these factors is the increased air pollution in the north of Italy. According to WHO estimates, this situation, even without the virus, led to over 8,000 additional deaths per year in 2006 in the 13 largest cities in Italy alone. The situation has not changed significantly since then. Finally, it has also been shown that air pollution greatly increases the risk of viral lung diseases in very young and elderly people.

Germany has more ICU beds per capita than any other European country at nearly 5 times the UK per 100,000. 

Also, if you look at a graph of NHS funding increases/decreases, the increases all coincide with years with labour in power (admittedly bar ‘new Labour’ which was just lite Toryism), and the decreases all coincide with years the Tories were in power. It’s not a coincidence. 

Conservatives make these same arguments over and over in all western countries, that funding education and healthcare won’t work, it has nothing to do with parties, both sides yadda yadda while conveniently ignoring or downplaying the success of scandanavia and Germany at implementing these practices.

It was a braindead response to modern and contemporary architecture and how it's destroying European building aesthetics. 

For a group of people who claim to not want to consume for fear of becoming slaves to the producer's ideologies they seem to have done the same to themselves just by inundating themselves with ""traditional"" (read: fascist) rhetoric. It's an absolutely brainless approach to beauty, aesthetics, and values. 

Many of the cathedrals, museums, and other buildings they worship were inspired by principles of mathematics and sciences that were available at the time. That has not changed. The source of inspiration is actually the same, but the complexities and development of the fields architects (and other designers/artists) draw on have in turn created development in the craft.

I think fascists should utilise striking and stuff until we get power but then obviously the state will be a people's state with all the classes integrated and working together. Private ownership will be retained but all industry will be organised, many forms of non-productive economic activity will be banned or limited to the state IE usury and speculation.

2) Any state that isn't increasing its power is by default decreasing its power because other states are going to be increasing their power. Isolationism, limiting your population etc are only going to leave you open to being conquered by other states. I am personally very eco-fascist but I can't get on board with anti-natalism even though I am against global overpopulation. In our friend-enemy distinction it's not the Europeans that are the problem. We are the only race that is environmentally conscious and we're the race with the smallest number. Indians, Africans and Asians all outnumber us, each of them about 2:1.

3) Nah the best solution is to make it impossible for them to hold office, own property, work in societal and cultural institutions etc in the country. Offer them repatriation sums to go to Israel where they belong.

The guy was the typical oversocialised shitlib who thinks he's a communist. Most 'Marxist-Leninist'/MLs are actually OLs, Oversocialised-Libertines. Credit to him for at least letting CT speak, CT definitely should have pointed out the humiliation, genocides, atrocities etc committed by communists though. But not in the 'hur dur commies bad too' way but just as a way of neutralising the childish 'a fascist did a bad thing ergo fascism bad' nonsense. Yeah the Germans made Jews work in concentration camps but the Jews created 'reeducation' prisons where they forced Romanian prisoners to eat human shit in a mockery of the Orthodox church procession where they eat the bread or whatever. Let's quit with the moralising bullshit and talk about how we're going to get international finance out of power, the 'left' never wants to have that conversation though because they're not actual dissidents.

&gt;Anyway there should definitely be more fascist vs communist debates IMO.

I'd like to see real marxists, especially the anti-idpol ones, talk to fascists. Richard Spencer and Eric Striker talking to Jason Unruhe was pretty good as an example.

The big problem with the UK healthcare system, at a really high level, is similar to the problems that Obamacare has and is facing. Right wingers are trying to hollow it out and reduce funding constantly. While M4A is not immune to this, the elimination of private healthcare would certainly reduce the massive level of healthcare lobbyists fighting against *any* move leftward in terms of healthcare.

I also do not understand the strategic argument at all for multi-step plans to enact M4A through a public option phase. You're changing the system completely at least twice, with at least two major legislative battles which will probably occur under different presidents. All while Republican and even some neoliberals will be desperate to undermine the system the whole time. Realistically you are waiting 12-24 years for even a chance to fight for M4A if we keep compromising at this rate. On top of all of this, if you make the starting point of the argument public option then you absolutely are still going to have to compromise rightward. At that point, it's not even a newsworthy legislative move IMO. 

If Bernie or other progressives in Congress start extremely strong on M4A and then get negotiated down to a generous public option or some other form of single payer then that's awesome.

[],,iowaboy,1243723352.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3hwpo,False,True,[],"Well, there is a big “if.”

First, you keep saying that rich people work more efficiently than poor people, but you haven’t provided any explanation or evidence of this (all your statistics as the about time spent working, not production).

Second, you don’t explain what counts as “work.” I’m a lawyer, so I work on the bus ride into the office, I “work” by attending lunches to hear speeches, I count time at the office as “work” even when it is talking to my coworkers about TV shows. I also know people who fudge their bills, saying they spent .8 hours on something that took them .2 hours. Compare that to a guy working at Subway or Wal-Mart who can only count the time he is clocked in. I would say that, on average, our “work” is about the same. I may work more on weekends/nights, but I also get paid a lot more.

Third, you are only counting paid labor. Because I make a butt-load of money, I pay for dry-cleaning, I pay a bunch for a gym next door to my office, I buy lunch instead of prepping, I have a cleaner come in each month, and I pay a bunch for a downtown apartment so my commute is shorter. My brother, who is a high school teacher, spends 2 hours on the weekend prepping lunch, has to go to the YMCA that’s out of his way, doesn’t have a cleaner, has a 30 minute commute each way, and doesn’t often get to just grab take-out after a long day. He probably works as much as I do, he just doesn’t get paid for a lot of it.

Fourth, I can work more because my time is more flexible. Shift workers have to be at their job at set times, and they have to get special permission to do other things. For example, I’m planning a wedding. If I need to talk to a caterer or visit a jeweler to see a ring, I don’t have to “take time off work.” I just leave. Same thing in case of emergencies (like my car breaking down or needing to go to a relative’s parole hearing or a doctor’s appointment). Someone at Target would have to take time off work for that, and lose 2-8 hours of work.

Fifth, my earning potential (and that of most wealthy people) is based largely on my “soft skills,” and not as much on how hard or efficiently I work. For example, as a young lawyer, I got a lot of my opportunities through luck or privilege. Like, I was asked to second-chair a trial because the client was sexist and said he didn’t want a woman associate working on his case and he liked me because I went to a football game with him (paid for by the firm). Because of that, I got valuable trial experience and a fat bonus while my female coworker (who was 3 years ahead of me and a much better lawyer) didn’t.

Sixth, the multiple income thing is BS. I have three streams of income: my job, my investment portfolio, and a side-gig selling wine to friends (I shop in crates from Europe, keep a few bottles myself, and mark up the rest). I can only do this because I have a lot of expendable cash and rich friends. It’s not fair to tell a guy working three part-time jobs that he should have passive income, when he barely gets paid enough to make rent and basics.

Lastly, and this is not related to earning potential, this stuff about “spending less time on the internet and watching TV” is absolute crap. Yeah, I probably watch less TV than a lot of poor people, but that’s because I spend my free time going to the theater, eating at nice restaurants, going to galas (which my firm pays for), or working late so I can go on a 2-week trip to Paris or Rome or a safari or India or a cruise or Mexico (all of which I did in the past 2.5 years). If I made $40,000/year and couldn’t afford to randomly spend $50 on a whim, I would definitely be spending more time on the TV or internet.

The point is that, yeah, a lot of relatively rich people work hard. But that’s not the secret to their success. The secret is a mix of luck, connections, privileged upbringing, along with intelligence and hard work. The last two are also not that important if you’re rich enough (I once worked at family foundation run by a dumbass who couldn’t get a real job, so his dad put him in charge of the foundation and paid him $150,000 to give away money). It is cruel to tell poor people that they are poor because of some moral failure or Oman’s work ethic. Sure, encourage poor people, and give them a leg-up if you can, but it’s patronizing to say “you just don’t work hard enough.” Like, if I’ve had paralegals and legal assistants who are smarter than me and work harder, but will never make 50% of my starting salary because they had to work to support their family instead of going to college. If I ever heard another lawyer belittling them for not working hard enough or being dumb, I would go straight to the managing partner and demand that lawyer be fired.",True,False,False,,,0,1585705014,,False,0,{},fm2tf77,False,t3_fsgz5l,False,True,t1_fm1tsas,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/fsgz5l/the_rich_work_harder_really/fm2tf77/,False,,1592791031,0,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,r/CapitalismVSocialism,public,,0,[],

Ideologia politica e fix cauza esecului gestionarii crizei cu corona. Nu ma mira haosul gestionarii acestei crize, cand toata lumea e interesata de profit. Acum 2 saptamani, Trump era interesat sa fie unemployment minim in SUA ca sa castige alegerile. Acum o luna, Orban era interesat sa faca alegeri anticipate ca are mult in sondaje.

Acum 2 luni, se dadeau SUME IMENSE salarii bancherilor din risk management de pe wall street si city si etc, ca sa faca analize complet inutile (Absolut complet), le-a stricat corona toata analiza, efectiv au primit bani degeaba, ca sa poata dupa sa mearga in vacanta in Alpi si  croaziere si sa raspandeasca corona prin lume.

Mai mult, toata preocuparea economiei din ultimii 10 ani a fost growth at all costs. Expandarea excesiva a industriei de travel, reclame, IT asociat cu reclame, trading, etc. La research long-term si not-for-profit mai putin, ca deh, de acolo nu vin vacante de lux. Sau la investitii in spitale la fel, mai putin. In SUA profiturile merg la expertii in sanatate privata, doar nu vroiai sa testeze pe bune de la inceput, le pica profitul. (iar trump a avut interesele lui personale, asa cum am mai zis).

Normal ca nu ai spitale pregatite pentru o epidemie generala cand sanatatea globala in capitalism e focusata pe tratarea preferentiala a bogatilor si lasarea in urma a saracilor, pentru a stoarce un profit cat mai mare, nu pentru a stoarce cat mai multe boli. Partea proasta e ca virusului nu ii pasa de contul bancar.

Nu ti se pare interesant ca tarile cele mai pregatite in lupta cu corona au fost Germania, Norvegia, Japonia, Coreea de Sud, Islanda? Adica fix tari care au sisteme sanitare cel mai bine finantate via taxe. Japonia anul trecut a avut GDP growth negativ ca sa creasca taxa pe consum.

Norvegia a testat 90.000 oameni pana azi. SUA, cu o populatie de 60 ori mai mare, a testat vreo 800k :))). (nu mai zic cum arata situatia acum 10 zile, ca era dezastruos, in conditiile in care tara colcaia de corona).

Dar e ok, SUA cuantifica competitia foarte bine, e un sistem meritocratic! Nu avem alternativa!!!!!! E cea mai buna solutie existenta! :)))

Cercetarea si achizitionarea de materiale in vest ar fi putut porni extrem de in forta inca din ianuarie, in loc sa inceapa in forta in martie, daca prioritatile ar fi fost binele comun si apararea binelui comun, in loc sa fie ''hai sa mergem la Zermatt, Aosta, Verbier, Ischgl, Solden etc etc etc in vacanta sa ne aratam statusul si sa punem poze pe Instagram"" sau cine stie ce activitati pe wall st unde s-au facut bani din nimic  (inca se fac bani din nimic si acum, iti confirm eu ca m-am jucat un pic cu cursul la monede care au fluctuat tare pe revolut :))))  )

Gandeste-te numai cate tranzactii de arme s-au facut in ianuarie si februarie. Noi aveam nevoie de arme pentru razboaie facute pentru certuri inutile intre niste natiuni istorice pt orgolii si profituri ale unor anumite regiuni, nu aveam nevoie de fabrici noi de masti de corona. E foarte bine ca am dat 2% din PIB la armata (SUA chiar 4%) in ianuarie-februarie! Extrem de util pentru spitale! 

Concluzia, daca ai citit tot: Eu sunt socialist. (si sa stii ca gresesti; si tie ti-as recomanda sa lasi ideologiile politice)

Faptul ca spun ce e rau in capitalism nu inseamna ca e socialism. Daca ti se pare ca e socialism, inseamna ca pur si simplu esti tu pollarizat de o parte si ignori problemele partii aleia pentru ca stii ca orgoliul tau e direct conectat cu acea parte. :)))

Husband's co-worker and family have all been diagnosed after traveling to Europe for Spring Break (at a point when they probably should have known better). Another, older co-worker has it, evidently from community transmission. I haven't heard about anyone from my organization being diagnosed, but it's such a huge place, it's inevitable. They issued a policy that we're not supposed to tell anyone except admin if we or someone we know gets it.

My relative is a physician in NYC. She had traveled to Africa to do medical service work just before things went south, and had to return early. Since she had a layover in Europe, she had to self-quarantine when she got back. The hospital has her scheduled for basically the second she can return and every second thereafter. 

I know it's her job and they need her, but I'm freaking out, and I usually don't freak out. Neither does she, but she's pretty somber about all of this, and actually got onto me about not using public transit, going downtown, or even going to stores if I can help it. I have a heart condition (feels weird to say but it's true) and I'm not sure if it makes me more susceptible to serious complications, but I'd rather not find out the hard way.

I don't mind staying home, and my job is pretty secure and easy to do remotely, so I can't complain.

Italy is an ideal outpost for China’s wide-reaching propaganda effort to cover up its own responsibility for the global spread of the new coronavirus, all the while presenting itself as a compassionate power aiding Western countries in need.

The government has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy that carefully combines sending medical supplies to assert its relevance in a leaderless world—call it mask diplomacy—while at the same time spreading conspiracy theories to conceal the true origin of the virus. In this “global battle of narratives,” as the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, [called it](https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/china/76401/eu-hrvp-josep-borrell-coronavirus-pandemic-and-new-world-it-creating_en), “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”

Italy provides the perfect environment to test Beijing’s strategy. It was the first Western country to be hit by a large coronavirus outbreak, and it is therefore urgently in need of medical supplies to support a health care system on the brink of collapse. But it’s also led by a government coalition that includes the Five Star Movement, a Euroskeptic and increasingly pro-Chinese party that has for years relentlessly promoted a stronger relationship with Beijing while downplaying the traditional trans-Atlantic alliance and fueling suspicion toward NATO. As a result, last year Italy was the first G-7 country to join the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure project.

Italy provides the perfect environment to test Beijing’s strategy. It was the first Western country to be hit by a large coronavirus outbreak; it’s also led by a coalition that includes the Five Star Movement, a Euroskeptic and increasingly pro-Chinese party.

Recently, China’s state media outlets suggested the new coronavirus originated in Italy, not in Wuhan, by shrewdly twisting the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi, the director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan. In an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/817974987) on March 19, Remuzzi said some doctors in northern Italy “remember having seen very strange pneumonias, very severe, particularly in old people in December and even in November,” an anecdotal fact that potentially suggested that the virus that originated in China had spread elsewhere even before commonly suspected.

The state-controlled *Global Times* [wrote](https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1241559268190343168) on Twitter that “#Italy may have had an unexplained strain of pneumonia as early as November and December 2019 with highly suspected symptoms of #COVID19, reports said.” A misleading version of Remuzzi’s statement was then broadcast by other arms of the Chinese government’s propaganda apparatus, such as China Central Television, and became a trending topic on the popular microblogging platform Weibo.

The Italian doctor, for his part, never even hinted that the coronavirus originated anywhere but China. “We can be certain that the virus emerged in Wuhan first, where it had probably been circulating for some time before it was made public in China,” Remuzzi told *Foreign Policy*, explaining that, if anything, the unconfirmed observations regarding previous cases of pneumonia in northern Italy would worsen—rather than ease—the burden of Chinese responsibility in covering up the early cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Genetic tests confirmed that the virus originated in China “beyond a shadow of a doubt,” said Remuzzi, who has recently been inundated with requests from Chinese journalists attempting to politicize his expertise to corroborate Beijing’s narrative.

### At the same time, Italy was the first beneficiary of China’s mask diplomacy. On March 12, a Chinese cargo plane bringing nine doctors, masks, respirators, and other medical equipment landed in Rome. The material displayed the words “The friendship road knows no borders” and was presented as a gift to the country going through the emergency. But it was not really a gift at all.

Italy was buying medical equipment from China, but the government took advantage of a parallel donation made by China’s Red Cross to make it look like an instance of its “politics of generosity.”

As the Italian reporter Giulia Pompili [explained](https://twitter.com/giuliapompili/status/1238508200938352640) in the [newspaper ](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/)[*Il Foglio*](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/), it was part of a commercial deal formalized a few days before in a phone call between the foreign ministers of China and Italy, Luigi di Maio and Wang Yi. Italy was buying medical equipment from China, but the government took advantage of a [parallel donation](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2020/03/13/news/che-cosa-c-e-dietro-il-mistero-della-donazione-cinese-all-italia-306507/) made by China’s Red Cross to make it look like an instance of its “politics of generosity.” A few days later, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the phone that he was willing to cooperate on a “Health Silk Road” to combat the pandemic.

Di Maio, who recently resigned as the leader of the Five Star Movement, is the point person for the Chinese initiatives in Italy and was instrumental in consolidating the partnership even under the previous government, when Five Star was the junior partner in the unorthodox, all-populist coalition with Matteo Salvini’s League.

“Those who scoffed at our participation in the Belt and Road Initiative now have to admit that investing in that friendship allowed us to save lives in Italy,” Di Maio [declared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7JRf6qaog) glowingly in an interview, sparking reactions from some of his Democratic Party colleagues in government, who are growing tired of seeing their political ally selectively praising China’s generous efforts while downplaying the belated solidarity coming from EU members.

“Many Euroskeptic leaders are acting as China enablers,” said Lucrezia Poggetti, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban personally welcomed a flight from China transporting nearly 70 tons of medical supplies, and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic theatrically kissed China’s flag when a team of doctors landed in Belgrade last week. “China is the only friend who can help us,” Vucic said, complaining about the lack of support from the EU.

“In Italy’s case, we can talk of ‘useful idiots’ fueling China’s propaganda,” Poggetti argues, insisting the term aptly describes Di Maio’s attitude toward China. “In part, he’s unaware of what he’s doing, in part he’s just trying to please the Five Star Movement electorate,” Poggetti told *Foreign Policy*. Meanwhile, the far-right League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, didn’t miss the opportunity to bash Beijing in order to hurt his former political ally (and now sworn enemy) Di Maio: “If the Chinese government knew \[about the virus\] and didn’t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity,” he [said](https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/politica/2020/03/26/coronavirus-salvini-cina-sapeva-crimine-contro-umanita_FGXtiR1tB3yPv9LIy313SJ.html?refresh_ce) during a debate session in the Senate, just a few days after re-upping on his social media an old [clickbait hoax](https://www.facebook.com/salviniofficial/videos/2752303571489985/) claiming that China was actively committed to engineering new viruses in its labs.

Southern Germany is Bavaria/Wuertemberg/Austria/Switzerland/etc. Those regions are not in Northern Europe.

- France: Your first obvious stop is pâtés. Fluffy, light, fatty and ridiculously sumptuous, you have the country style with chunks of meat and the straight up liver pâtés that are basically a cooked emulsion of fat and liver. In several different flavours, you can't go wrong. The summum (and costliest) item in French charcuterie is foie gras, fatty goose/duck liver, preferably seared and sprinkled with finishing salt, it'll make you slap your momma. Look up a local french butcher if you're in a large city, or the next best thing.

- Italian: Masters of pork and all its declinations, you could fill volumes (and it's been done numerous times) with all that Italian charcuterie has to offer with pork products. Beyond the obvious prosciutto and pancetta, I recommend guanciale (cured pork jowl) as an addition to various pasta sauces (specifically carbonara and all'amatriciana) and dry sausages such as the spicy calabrese, to start. These are personal preferences and account for less than .1% of what's available, just saying. Your local variant of Little Italy has you covered.

- Spain/Portugal/Brazil: Chorizo, duh. But beyond this wonderful, spicy sausage, Spain is the low-key king of the cured ham. While everyone is busy wrapping their cantalope in common prosciutto, Spain is out there feeding pigs with acorns and producing the world's most refined (and astronomically priced) leg of ham, Jamon Iberico de Bellota. Your snootiest deli will have it, it will cost you a fortune, and you will forever brag about the taste.

- British++: We're gonna go wide with this one and include Commonwealth products, such as South African biltong (basically beef jerky but, you know, exotic), Scottish haggis (it sounds gross but is amazing on toast or stuffed in a chicken breast) and Canadian bacon (no one in Canada calls it that, it's back bacon or peameal bacon and is made with the loin). Other than the above, the Brits specialize in breakfast sausages, fatty bacon and blood pudding. Americans only wish their breakfasts were this cholesterol-inducing good and all of it is available in most of the English-speaking world. Speaking of...

- America: Jerky and corned beef are the obvious frontier products from the good ol' US of A, but the innate advantage of America is its access to all the world's charcuterie innovations thanks to its immigrant population. But more, much more than this, they do it their way! America has done what many of the old countries would not dare and experimented with the old world recipes to give them new twists and flavour profiles. Once you've gotten a feel for the original recipe, do give the American Franken-creations a try.

- Eastern Europe: Poland, Czechia, Ukraine and Russia all rely heavily on garlic and paprika for their creations. They're not wrong. If you have a Polish butcher in your area, God bless you son.

- East Asia and Scandinavia: They salt fish and crustaceans. I'm not familiar with their products, but from my understanding, they are as good as they sound gross. Start yourself off with easy flavours like kimchi, salt cod, and prawn chips. Then dive into the deep end with surstromming and hakarl (fermented herring and shark). Go boldly where few men have gone before.

- Quebec: A short note of the products from my homeland; they're mostly like what you'll find in America, but with an obviously heavier influence from France, but there are a few special items. Cretons (a pork and breadcrumb breakfast spread) and Montreal-style smoked meat (very much like pastrami, but with different curing spices and exclusively made with brisket meat) are worth the detour.

However, I'd argue both the book and game don't go all the way with this. Basically, for a guy who's arc is supposed to be about growing past his anger and need for revenge, there's very little anger or lust for revenge from Ezio. He's mostly the same chill guy throughout the same game. We almost never see him actually get angry or emotional about his actions. Even his assassinations are mostly respectful and to the point (With Veri as one you mentioned but that's only one). As a result, there's not much of an actual growth or progression in his character. It feels like the game just says he's grown. His speech to Rosa about how he's grown falls flat because he's been the same person all this time.

The novelization makes some improvements here where Ezio kills 2 more of his targets in very brutal and angry ways before feeling guilty over what he did. Even Mario chews him out for it rather just say ""show respect"" and Ezio feels legitimately even more guilty about that. 

The problem is that these instances seem few and far between if at all. The game as a whole goes out of its way to make Ezio seem cool and likeable. As a result, his actual overcoming of his anger and need for revenge is hardly a factor. Most of the targets Ezio faces are just bad guys who happened to be on the list of people who killed his family. He doesn't really face any emotional challenge or grows from facing most of them. When his father and brothers are killed, Ezio's first concern is helping his remaining family get to safety. He needs extra assurance from his allies in Florence that his family are safe and he needs to kill the guy who betrayed them before he can leave with his family. When he's at Montergioni, Ezio refuses to go along with Mario's plan to become an Assassin to fight back, instead planning on taking his remaining family to Spain for their own safety. He barely agrees to get more training.

The end result is that it feels that Ezio is already that wise assassin who's overcome his anger and need for revenge. Think about it, if he had anger issues, wouldn't he drop everything to go after his targets which puts his family in even more danger and/or jeopardizes his missions? That would be far more interesting than Perfect Ezio where everything is fine and actually give him a path to improve. Imagine if when going to assassinate targets, he butts heads with the other assassins and learns to become more mature and wise as he sees how his anger messes stuff up. Now when he gives his speeches and is inducted into the order, it feels earned because we have seen that progress and it was actual progress.

And just at the last moment, he decided everything was simply not worth it, despite knowing Rodrigo is a Pope and has the army of the whole Europe under his command to seek vengeance on him and everyone he loves?

&lt;&lt;Thus Enver’s decision to launch a wintertime offensive with ill-clothed troops in the mountains is often presented as the epitome of stupidity and fanaticism. Total Ottoman losses were crippling but closer to 60,000 than the 130,000–140,000 of popular legend. One explanation advanced for Enver’s otherwise seemingly ineffable heedlessness for entering both the war and the offensive at Sarikamish is a deep-seated pan-Turanism, a grand desire to unite the Turkic and Muslim peoples of the Caucasus, Russia, and Central Asia with those of the Ottoman empire. Such an explanation is not convincing.   


As noted earlier, Ottoman mobilization plans deployed the army in the west, not on the Caucasian front. Despite the fact that an invasion of the Caucasus was the most obvious and straightforward way to bring the war to Russia, Enver settled on a Caucasian offensive only after discarding for geographic and logistical reasons other options of attack through the Balkans or across the Black Sea.79 The military stalemate in Europe led Germany and Austria-Hungary to press the Ottomans to launch an offensive against Russia sooner. Enver’s concept of encircling Russian units at Sarikamish and cutting them off from their rear was daring but not hare-brained and in accord with standard military doctrine.  \*Finally, the Ottomans made no effort even to present the operation as pan-Turanist.\*  


The tactical blunder committed by Enver at Sarikamish emphasized so often to underscore the alleged irrational pull of pan-Turanism upon Enver and the Ottomans in general – islessremarkablewhencomparedwiththerecordofBritish, French, and German generals ﬁghting on the western front in France, who sacriﬁced far greater numbers of lives over a longer period of time for no strategic advantage.&gt;&gt;

1. Obsessively loyal
2. Loyal and willing to overlook negatives
3. Loyal but judgemental
4. Judgemental
5. Obsessively judgemental




&gt;
1. Are the type of people to ship characters together and accuse any form of criticism as ""hating"" on the series
2. Are the people who use contrived EU details to explain away faults/plotholes in the series.
3. Are the people who who are willing to look past the clear faults and plotholes because they either suspend disbelief enough to enjoy what they're watching or just plain don't care about any of the plotholes etc
4. People who probably still enjoy what they're watching but especially enjoy pointing out what's wrong with it
5. People who find fault with every scene and character and find no enjoyment in watching our critiquing the movies at all.

I'm leaving out most people with this scale and purely ranking ""fans"" in the literally sense of the word. This isn't meant to be a serious scale, just a general one. The good thing about Star Wars fandom that keeps it from being stale is that everyone sort of disagrees with each other. It helps that Rick and Morty as a television show isn't taking itself as seriously as Star Wars is, which makes it harder to be passionate about.

With R&amp;M fans (and once again I mean fanatics), they're pretty much either obsessively into the show, or annoyed with the people who are obsessively into the show.

I can only speak as a Czech person who has travelled quite a lot and who has met many different people from many different countries. The reality is that we are a small country and so most people around the world are ignorant about us and that's fine. I am ignorant about many countries as well.

When it comes Western Europeans, it's a bit different though. They have an ignorant portion of the society as well however these people typically do not think they are ignorant about us. People from the rest of the world are aware they know close to nothing, but people in the Western Europe think they know quite some information about our countries. I guess this is because we are on the same continent and from time to time, they hear something about us in the media, or they know someone who travelled here etc. So this gives them a sense of familiarity and unfortunately it also gives them the confidence to spew ignorant bullshit.

It's like a combination of ignorance and arrogance. And because we are white just like them, they say it without the fear of being accused of racism. You would be surprised how casually they can say such things to you, even directly to your face and expect you to either agree with them (if it's some wannabe serious analysis/observation about our country) or laugh at it (if it's an attempted joke even if it's insulting as fuck). To give you an example, I was once given a long lecture by a British getleman who explained to me how nowadays, Prague is not a destination for sophisticated people (like him) because it's just a place where people go get shit faced drunk. When I tried to explain to him that Prague has way more to offer than just cheap booze and that many tourists in fact come for those purposes and it's just groups of young men from the UK/Scandinavia/Netherlands etc. who come here to get shit faced drunk, he got dismissive and did not want to hear it. I also stopped counting how many times I heard the ""joke"" from numerous Western European guys that because I am Czech, I must have been in porn or know someone who has. How hilarious right? 

But I am of course not saying similar stuff doesn't happen to other ethnic groups or that it doesn't happen in my country as well.

I guess what stinks about this whole thing is that you guys think of yourself as being these very open-minded tolerant societies and I feel like you are a little bit in denial about the portion of your society that can be downright xenophobic.

I like how that is the only response to anything you tell people that they don't want to hear.  The reality is that an iPhone or the latest Samsung Galaxy isn't worth £800 in parts. The reality is that we shouldn't be creating disposable smartphones that cost ~£20. 

We could easily let African countries (+Mongolia) control their own resources and we could a) pay a fair wage and b) build things to last. The fact that the bigger countries use a variety of hidden (to anyone who doesn't know where to look) neocolonial tactics to essentially be the ones controlling the leash and resources should horrify people. 

So, when African countries were struggling, they took out loans from the IMF and the IMF gave them huge, unsustainable loans. Europe and the USA essentially flooded the countries with huge amounts of clothes, inappropriate farming equipment (requiring gasoline) and this destroyed clothing industries etc. Of course, they were struggling off the backs of being decolonised in the wake of WW2. So when your people are suffering from famines and struggling for clothes because native people were often pushed into the undesirable parts of their countries...

The IMF (+Europe/America) and charities also didn't do any due diligence and essentially gave stuff to warlords.  Or actively sabotaged anything resembling stability if it was leaning towards communist/socialist/a bit of pink compared to the UK/USA especially. I have no doubt that the SU did the same to countries in Africa - it's one of the few parts of SU stuff I don't know much about. 

On top of this, missionaries continued their plague upon the African continent. They massively helped the spread of AIDS, helped in making sure African families stayed big e.g. no condoms, no birth control, no abortions for you. Convert and follow our rules or else. 

Oh, and also, getting involved with the UN and then refusing to actually help, using African countries to extract, dump, make, mine and refine hazardous chemicals. There's the selling of weapons and explicit support of dictators (similar to South America and Saudi Arabia) and fucked up policies (South Africa).  There was some debt relief, a whopping $76 billion for 30 countries in the last 24 years. 

For reference, Bezos is worth 119 billion dollars. 

Then the West, now with China/Russia in the mix essentially told Africa as part of debt relief that they needed to increase social spending. They continued the same bad practices.  Sadly, it's easier for the citizens EU/Russia/China/the USA to just assume that African countries naturally struggle because keeping them dependent is the idea. 

Just look at how the same thing applies to Mongolia &amp; South America. Are those countries naturally fucked up? No. It's also fucked up that people have trained themselves to just shrug. :/",True,False,False,,,0,1585724107,,False,2,{'gid_2': 2},fm3hwwu,False,t3_fspne1,False,True,t1_fm3a80x,/r/worldnews/comments/fspne1/the_trump_administration_is_ramping_up_airstrikes/fm3hwwu/,False,,1592802680,666,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,,4,[],

I personally think the film should have been less about finding Relic Maps (which was kinda the plot of the first sequel film anyway) and more about the gathering of forces for the final battle that they just skimmed over.



Show us Lando trying to convince old lady Hera to lead Twi'leks into battle, give us Sabine Wren as Mand'alor leading her people to battle. The Droid Gotra. Actual visible force ghosts for Anakin and Obi-Wan. Shriv and Zaya. The Chiss, even. Make it feel truly connected and have this whole build up as the main characters (Finn, Poe, Rey, and Rose) try and set up for this attack.



Have them infiltrate like Luke and Han and Leia on Endor perhaps.

That is pretty ridiculous and hyperbole, as is evident to anyone who knows anything about the death tolls, so I will admit that I didn't read the title.

&gt; Germany, after world war 1 was forced to demilitarise and was not allowed to build certain weapons of war. From memory I believe key ones were stealth warships, tanks and heavy artillery.

Actually, the provisions were more sweeping; the total amount of soldiers in the Reichswehr was to be no more than 100,000 men in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions; the Großer Generalstab (the Great General Staff) and ""all similar organizations"" were to be dissolved, and the Reichswehr was permitted only 4,000 officers; the Rhineland was to be demilitarized, and all military structures and fortifications 50km (31 miles) East of the Rhine were to be demolished, with a forbiddance on making new ones; military structures on Heligoland and Düne were to be demolished; they were forbidden from the arms trade; their navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and a maximum of six light cruisers not exceeding 6,000 long tons each, and a maximum of twelve destroyers not exceeding 800 long tons each (at a time when the average was around 1,000 long tons), twelve torpedo boats not exceeding 200 long tons each, and no submarines; naval personnel was limited to 15,000 men; officer count was not to exceed 1,500 men; Germany was forbidden an air force, and Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft for a period of six months.

&gt; Except Germany remilitarised pretty much right away.

Actually, the Germans began remilitarization of areas such as the Rhineland and (un)officially began violating the Versailles Treaty around 1935-6, when the Wehrmacht was established and replaced the Reichswehr.

For example, of the 100,000 allowed, the Wehrmacht recruited ~3.7 million people into its army, violating the treaty by a narrow ~3.6 million people, within the period of 1935-1939.

Now, I know how you are wondering. How the *fuck* did they keep that under the table? The answer? Appallingly bad investigation on part of the soon-to-be Allies, and such excellent cover-ups as renaming the *VsKfz 31* to the *""Leichttraktor""* (aka, ""light tractor""). They later introduced the *SdKfz 101* (""special purpose vehicle 101""), better known as the Panzer I. These excellent deception strategies worked masterfully on the soon-to-be Allies, because the soon-to-be Allies thought that if they bowed down to Mr. Hitler and gave him what he wanted (to an extent), he'd stop being so mean and play along with everyone else. That is why Neville Chamberlain (the sheer raw bucket of competence he was) decided to put in place the policy of appeasement, which prevented another war. Oh wait, it did nothing.

&gt; And even though AF LEAST the UK and America knew about it, they did nothing.

You really are overestimating how much the UK genuinely knew about German remilitarization, or even what Germany wanted. Anthony Eden, British Foreign Secretary, seriously thought that by ***1940*** they could persuade Germany to return to the League of Nations, accept armament limitations, and renounce territorial claims in Europe in exchange for remilitarization of the Rhineland, return of former German African colonies, and German ""economic priority along the Danube"" *(Crozier, Andrew; Appeasement and Germany's Last Bid for Colonies; 1988)*. 

The ones who *did* figure it out was the NKVD, which reported accurately in 1936 that Germany was going to remilitarize the Rhineland. Stalin, wisely enough, decided ***not to*** pass this information on to the Western (S.T.B.) Allies *(Shore, Zach; Hitler, Intelligence, and the Decision to Remilitarize the Rhine; 1999)*.

Besides, America wanted nothing to do with Europe at the time, so why would they give two fucks about Germany?

&gt; Because both of them WANTED another world war. Especially America.

You do know that British Appeasement policies were designed to ***avoid*** another war, right?

Also, America was in the middle of its isolationist phase at the time, and the, as you described it, war-hungry Americans waited until ***1941, two whole fucking years*** to enter World War II, and did so on December 8th, after being ***attacked by surprise in the infamous ""Hawaii Operation"", also known as the Attack on Pearl Harbor,*** which was later judged to be, oh, look at that, a ***fucking war crime*** *(Totani, Yuma; The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II; 2009)*.",True,False,False,,,0,1585726106,,False,0,{},fm3jvvu,False,t3_fsojt9,False,True,t1_fm3gc0b,/r/Trumpvirus/comments/fsojt9/while_other_countries_prepared_for_the_pandemic/fm3jvvu/,False,,1592803615,1,True,False,Trumpvirus,t5_2gg7fd,r/Trumpvirus,public,,0,[],

I think the major argument for global indices not being at the end - or close in my opinion - of the bear run is the timing for Q1 reporting. IMO the markets are trading off of sentiment (poor and worsening) and responding to fiscal and monetary stimuli from global governments. The tightening of the Indian labour market, Q1 reporting lag, worsening Covid situation in the US, UK, India and EU and rising unemployment leading to hugely reduced output are all reasons why the markets will worsen into the next quarter. Given the timing of lockdowns and damage to consumer finances, I’d say we have at least another 6 months of pain to go.

* The ECJ, alongside strong competition and anti-monopoly regulations (you would be surprised how many companies get sanctioned millions of euros for blatant cartel-formation, from air cargo to the people who build and maintain escalators and elevators (yes, really))
* Social security reciprocity (aka why you can retire in another EU country and keep your pension)
* An elimination of geographical discrimination in the internal market (aka why you can watch VRT while on the beach in Spain now)
* No roaming costs
* Defending our interests as a cohesive unit on par with the US and China

Among many many more! For example the EU also funds a plethora of NGO/civil society actors that occupy roles the EU is too cumbersome to fully address. These include everything from a European-level cyclist's rights NGO, to disabled rights groups, to even things like the European Cross Border Car Rental conciliation service (aka if you ever rent a car in another European country and they try to rip you off, as a European these guys will take them to court for you, at no cost).

 Doesn't make you right for doing it too though.

Most people here aren't saying stuff like that because the subject is a woman. They are saying it because the subject is a hypocrite. You can't seem to comprehend this, no matter how many times I say it. Most comments above would have been exactly the same, with different insults, if the subject were a man. ""White Knight"" is a term used exclusively for people who overprotect women even when they are in the wrong, but If a person tried to protect someone for the sole reason of let's say, their sexuality; they would have gotten similar reactions in another theoretical situation. Have you ever been to a fighting sub? ""That guy fucking deserved it"", ""That dude had it coming"" etc. So why should it be different for women specifically? Because they have a vagina? This is the nature of humanking in general. We inherently like watching people fight, that's why in schools or other places, when there is a fight you see people encircling it. I'm not a fan of violence IRL to be honest, haven't been in a fight since middle school. I usually ignore inferior people. That doesn't mean I hate seeing hypocrites getting spanked though. 

So in the end, this is just the same reaction people give to a male-male fight. Except people like you get butthurt because the subject here happens to be a woman. There is litterally zero difference. If you want to ban this subreddit for this reason only, you also have the obligation to ask for the banning of all the other subs that involve any kind of violence. Because comments there will be similar, just ignored because the subject is a male. 

Other than that, like I said, I once posted about how I parked to a all-women parking lot. I didn't know back in the day that they actually had a logical purpose. I got really aggressive replies of people calling me all sorts of insults, just for parking to somewhere I shouldn't have. I just can't see how this sub is still seen as a ""bastion of r/beatingwomen"". probably because of confirmation bias. 

Another sidenote, if we are doing generalizations, I'm gonig to go ahead and say that this whole site is racist, sexsist and possibly xenophobic. They are just ignored because the subjects to these are usually people other people don't care about.  I have been to r/europe a few times, and just because of my Turkish origin, people there insulted me, called me slurs etc. But I have never generalized the entire sub by saying it's racist.

&gt;The current spending on social protection is 21.3 billion. To give everyone 100 a week would cost 25.1 billion. But you can't cut all types of social protections and you would no longer need tax credits in this system so let's break it down a bit. If you gave everyone €100 per week it would cost 25.1billion assuming Google Irish population number is correct.

Seems about right to me 

&gt;Now if you get rid of tax credits. People in other categories get more but let's assume everyone who works is a single adult with no kids. A single person in Ireland gets 3300 in tax credits. So if everyone started paying tax from the first bit of employment they have that would make the state 11.15 billion assuming government numbers on employment rates are correct. It would also simplify the paperwork done by government for taxes lowering the need for certain civil servant jobs which could be redirected to somewhere they're more needed or terminated which would save the state more tax money.

While i agree on the financials, i don't see the cost saving for admin being all that much. Revenue are exceptionally lean and efficient as it is, and the payroll filing system is mostly automated. 

&gt;Supplementary payments could be stopped (electricity, gas, telephone, fuel allowance, ect.), people should budget for basic bills, just like how employed people currently do. Saving 813 million. Cut the community employment scheme, if all you want is work experience and not a job then volunteer rather than being cheaper labor to businesses at the government's cost. Saving 335 million

I think you're into some issues here. That 813m also includes rent supplement (but not HAP). Given that the UBI you suggest is €5000, you have the problem that some people will already now be worse off if you remove all of those supports. 

&gt;Admin of social welfare is currently 300million for pay and 266 million in non pay costs an 142 million in transfer costs. People are no longer signing off or on so that lessens the amount of admin needed. You are automatically registered when you're born and un-registered when you die. You have to set up a bank account once and after that if you change bank accounts it's the bank that deals with a movement of debits You still need a team to deal with new citizens and original sign on but you don't need regular meetings so 1 to 2 offices in the country would work. Let's assume the employees are all either kept or put to other civil servant jobs. You save 142 in transfer costs. Let's say you save 1/5th of non pay costs since you're no longer doing drop ins or regular meetings. You save 53 million.

People are going to have to sign on and off though because the state will still have to provide benefits above the €5200 per year UBI, as it is we provide more than €10,000 for those on welfare, those costs are still going to remain, all you'll do is reduce the payments due to UBI, not necessarily the workload, but in general i would suggest there is some saving to be made here, just not to such an extent. 

&gt;Pensioners and people on income supports are still getting money as usual as are illness disability and careers. Now the illness disability and careers supports (4.68billion) can't really be touched without damaging the disadvantaged. State pensions (8.43 billion) and Income support (3.29 billion) could be altered. Especially the latter. In many countries you only get income supports for the first 6months on unemployment, an amount that slowly decreases so you can adjust to living on less money or give you that boost to get another job. Ireland actually has this as job seekers benefit (3.54 million) let's keep this but half it since we now have BI. In fact let's keep all the other income supports (1.69billion) other than job seekers allowance (1.6 billion)

So it seems here you're reducing job seekers but again we can't leave people with less money that the get now, so we aren't really saving anything from what i can gather. I don't see the 3.54 billion figure anywhere either. Job seekers only makes 1.6 of the welfare spend so halving it would be possible but elimination isn't. 

&gt;Let's look outside of social protection spending. Education 11.2 billion 3rd level students no longer need the means tested grant supports as the have their basic income. Saving 376 million.
Skills development 589 million. Solas is mostly grants and free course for unemployed but some of it is handling internal money. Let's leave 89million for office work and pull the free classes. Most courses are either not fit for purpose or cost little enough the you should afford it from the basic income. Save 500 million Let's leave everything else as it is in education, our general system is pretty alright as it is.

That figure covers more than SUSI and the top rate for SUSI is also more than the proposed UBI. 

&gt;Agriculture 1.6 billion Farm sector supports are 864 million. If you can't make a profit what are in business, many farms in Ireland operate at a loss due to cost of machinery and not having enough land to profit off the machinery. If you want to tip away making nothing you can with the BI. If you operate at a loss you're a leach and making it harder for others to expand. Cut the supports. Saving 864 million You'd also save on administration no longer giving so many individual supports but we'll ignore that. Let's leave the rest

Agriculture is subsidised across the EU as part of the EUs policy of food security, without that payment we'd be overly reliant on imports of food. As it stands Ireland is the second most secure food nation in the world. I don't agree that agriculture supports can be scrapped, its also a massive employer and the loss of jobs and the cost those have to the exchequer needs to be considered also. 

&gt;Let's also leave health, transport and justice alone.

Absolutely agree

&gt;So cost for bi is 6.585 billion. State pensions 8.43. billion. Take €100 a week from each pensioner as they're now getting that much as bi. Number of pensioners approx 630,000

a huge amount from that pensions figure is made up from amounts paid in by teachers, Gardai etc.. that afaik are constitutionally protected as private property so i don't think you can just take €100 away but i'd need to check 

&gt; it'd cost 3.2 billion increased spending but a massive overhaul of systems. The most needy would get the exact same. Those long-term unemployed would be hit badly. Businesses operating at a regular yearly loss would be hit badly.

While i think your figures aren't accurate, i agree that it would require a major overhaul were it to be introduced and it simply wouldn't work with the system we have now.

I am less familiar with the situation in the US, but if it were true that all that counted were corporate interests and also that corporate interests were by their nature misaligned with the interests of the public then I don’t see how one could explain the massive expansion of social and environmental regulation over the last decades in many European countries. Or take as an example, Germany’s nuclear phase out decided in 2011. This is a policy decision with massive detrimental ramnifications for the vast majority of key industries in Germany, yet it was taken by a conservative government.

In my view, the reality is much more complex. In particular, corporations or rich investors do sometimes fight for some interests of a significant portion of the public and the resources they have available are not always due to rent seeking or exploitation, but sometimes because they excelled at promoting, servicing and/or harnessing these interests. 

Further there are perfectly valid reasons why supply driven subsidies are preferred by policy makers rather than demand driven aids to the public. Supply based subsidies can be much better targeted at the industries (including all people that work in these industries) that are most severely affected and what’s more the state often gets a return on these investments. Government bailouts to companies do not typically come in the form of free subsidies, but rather in exchange for titles (obligations, shares, etc.) and need to be paid back with interests. It is thus not meaningful to directly compare these to handouts.

First post, sorry for the long question.

In the U.S., Social Distancing is not strongly enforced.  So how well it works comes down to a measure of how scared the populous is.  The majority of people, at least where I am, are scared and staying at home and avoiding contact.

With fewer people exposed to the virus, it can’t spread as fast and we flatten the curve, limiting the number of infected and thus the number of deaths.  All good.  But aren’t we simply going to start over whenever we relax the mitigation?  With lax enforcement of Social Distancing, the chances of COVID19 cases being removed from the population is basically zero.  Thus the rate of spread accelerates again once the uninfected population comes into contact with the virus again.

My mental image is a very long period of on-again/off-again Social Distancing measures going on indefinitely, with an end (unless something changes\*) only when enough of a percentage of the population has been infected (and thus gained immunity) for the virus to die out, basically running its course.  Does the modeling suggest this ends anywhere other than a large percentage of the population (say 30%) eventually getting the virus?

Self-imposed Social Distancing out of fear in this case will be pervasive and long lasting, rather than going back to “normal” at the end of April, right?

\* I’m intentionally ignoring unknowns, such as if the virus will die down over the summer, and dramatic changes, like discovering a vaccine.

Certainly once people have isolated for 4-5 weeks we will have significantly reduced the number of contagious people, and the chances of any one person getting infected are low.  But that increases over time, just like it did when the cases originally came in to the U.S. from China and Europe.  As I understand it, mathematically this stops when a large enough percentage of the population has eventually gotten the virus, no matter how long that takes.

I’d like to be wrong and have Social Distancing fundamentally change the model outcome, but it isn’t clear why it would.",True,False,False,,,0,1585734466,,False,0,{},fm3rpd5,False,t3_frr754,False,True,t3_frr754,/r/COVID19/comments/frr754/weekly_question_thread_week_of_march_30/fm3rpd5/,False,,1592807324,2,True,False,COVID19,t5_2f4l19,r/COVID19,public,,0,[],

Ne doit-on pas admettre que certaines personnes pensent différemment et que ça ne changera pas et que pour le bien de nos relations on peut éviter certains sujets?

Personnellement, après des années passées à me disputer avec mes parents toujours sur les mêmes histoires, j'ai décidé d'arrêter de me prendre la tête. Je préfère éviter certains sujets et admettre que certaines personnes font des trucs que je considère bête. A l'inverse, certaines personnes trouvent surement ce que je fais bête. Je suppose que c'est inhérent à la vie, et si on pensait tous la même chose on s'emmerderait grave. Je pense aussi qu'en famille parfois l'atmosphère n'est pas bonne pour réussir à convaincre les gens (on est plus borné avec ces parents, on sera plus à l'écoute d'une personne extérieure etc.).

A l'inverse, j'ai déjà eu la discussion avec des potes à moi qui considèrent que j'ai abandonné. Et que c'est un peu ""lâche"" ce que je fais. Moi personnellement, je me dis que la vie est courte et que j'ai envie de profiter de ma famille d'une manière positive.

Un ex-voisin m'a un jour dit: pour pouvoir débattre, il faut que les deux partis soient disposés à dialoguer et à se convaincre mutuellement, sinon c'est juste exposer ses opinions. Et je finirai avec cette phrase d'Orelsan: ""Désolé si y'a pas que des experts à ta table"". Ben ouais, t'as peut-être un BAC S donc tu trouve que ce que ta mère fait est naze. Mais quelqu'un à côté a un doctorat en biologie médicale et il trouve ce que toi tu fais naze :D.

Sadly the positive comments stops there.

Yes China censored information and information got out late. But South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong received this information the same that everybody else did, and they are (or were) doing fine. Malaysia was doing incredibly well until a few religious gatherings led to the virus spreading out of control.The reason the situation is so dire in Europe and America is because your governments fucked up. 

Singapore was doing fine handling the virus when China was the centre of the outbreak. We were incredibly annoyed at having to deal with this shit because China tried to cover it up in late Dec, but we were dealing well with it, as were the other countries indicated above. 

But 2 weeks ago we had a sudden explosion in cases, most of them imported from the UK and America, and now the number of local cases is on the rise. It's not just Singapore, [it's South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong too](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/coronavirus-china-hong-kong-singapore-south-korea.html).

We probably would've kept it under control if Europe/ America contained the situation but nooooooooo now we gotta deal with the possibility of widespread community transmission because these other Western countries didn't give a shit because it's 'just a flu' and we in Asia didn't realise how fucking incompetent they were till it was too late. So why dont you all take a good look at yourselves first.

**Edit**: The other common argument I see is that China lied to WHO and western countries believed what WHO told them. 

You can blame China for lying to WHO all you want, but if you have a foreign affairs department, intelligence agency and health ministry, then the only reason you can be unprepared is because your country is incompetent. Or in the case of the US none of them are functioning but either way the blame lies on your government for not acting and letting the virus sweep your country. 

Also before someone goes MUH AUTHORITARIAN ASIAN REGIMES Im pretty sure Taiwan is more democratic than your beloved country so shut the fuck up.

Nothing prior to you converting will be held against you. When you became Muslim you started fresh, like a newborn baby. 

&gt;My husband has never been able to provide for me

Not a very Muslim thing to do. The man is duty-bound to provide basics for his wife and children.

&gt;He does not want me to work and had been very clear about that

But he won't either? I'm so, so sorry sis. I'm responding to each and every point of yours with a heavier and heavier heart... you should not have gone through any of this. I feel for you and completely understand that you are feeling hurt and confused. I don't like this man one bit. 

&gt;So currently we are relying on my mother and grandmother to help is out which makes me feel horrible to say the least.

Which self respecting man does that??? 

&gt;i'm starting to feel resentment towards him.

Not surprised at all.

&gt;i am not allowed to and have to say sorry. So i say sorry

What the hell? Why wouldn't you be allowed to speak your mind? A spouse is supposed to be a source if mercy and comfort, not someone you have to hide from or be under the thumb of. 

&gt;He starts screaming at me and pushing me in a corner and threatens me to beat me up,

He's threatening abuse... 

&gt;Now, he has decided to act like a baby and ignore me, not sleeping next to me, not speaking to me. When i ask for a hug he refuses when i hug him he's standing like a statue.

Blames *you* for *his own voluntary behavior*...

&gt;, a few weeks ago we had a fight where he hit me in the face (lightly) and pulled my hair on the bus where everyone could see it. I've lost count how many times he treathened to get a second wife to hurt me and i am in islam not allowed to leave him, and how many times he has treathed he would kill me.

Never mind, not only is he abusive but he isn't safe for you and your child to be with at all ... 



&gt;for the sake of Allah i want to work things out.

Allah swt does not demand us to, though. Why would you want to remain with a man clearly who isn't a good one, who endangers you and is a danger to your child? Sweetheart you have every right and every reason to leave. None at all, I repeat, none at *all*, to stay. 

&gt;i have no saying in this marriage, according to him. 

Scumbag is an abuser just using Islam as his manipulation tactic. He's a scumbag though, whatever flag he wants to wave at you to justify his scummy actions. 

I'm so sorry. But I don't see reason for you to stay. I'm afraid this man has already threatened you and has previously hurt you, you need to develop a plan and leave. I'm going to ask others to chime in since your post looks European and I'm halfway across the world with no idea how things work there but you need to speak to family and social services which will help you get out of this. You deserve to feel safe and you deserve peace of mind and spirit. You deserve the freedom entitled to every human. Not this. 

Start saving whatever cash you can. Can you talk to your mother and grandma? Get them on board, would they not be supportive of getting rid of this unemployed mooch? What about community? 

Kinda rambling now since I'm getting more and more upset for this sis' sake. Chime in please, let's help her get the help she needs?

20% zinc oxide is supposed to provide UVA protection that is on par with the UVA protection imparted by the new generation chemical UVA filters.

Amongst mineral sunscreens, the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc SPF 50 is likely the one that provides the most robust UVA protection. I say that because the company (Neutrogena) has actually released a UVA Protection Value for this sunscreen. It's 32, which is VERY high. 

Unfortunately, in my experience, this sunscreen is unwearable because of the white cast, thickness, greasiness and shininess.

Like you, I used mineral sunscreens EXCLUSIVELY for many years. I swore by mineral sunscreens and to this day I absolutely LOVE the low irritation profile and photostability afforded by mineral sunscreens.

Since I couldn't make the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc work for me, I eventually started experimenting with newer generation chemical sunscreens. These are NOTHING like the old school chemical sunscreens that use Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octinoxate, etc.. in the sense that they are NOT irritating at all and are very, very photostable. The filters I'm talking about are Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, and Uvinul A Plus for UVA protection and Uvinul T150 for UVB protection.

I'm currently using a couple of Bioderma sunscreens. Namely, the Bioderma Photoderm Kids Spray SPF 50+ and Photoderm Max Family Milk SPF 50+. The UVA Protection Value for these sunscreens is 39 and 42, respectively.

In contrast, most mineral sunscreens and old school chemical sunscreens have UVA Protection Values under 10. So as you can see, that is a HUGE difference.

I have to import these sunscreens from Europe to the US because the FDA is about 30 years behind on UV filter approval than (literally) the rest of the world. American sunscreens, for this reason, ""by definition/default,"" are HIGHLY inferior to European, Asian or Australian sunscreens. 

If you want to continue using mineral sunscreens, I've found a couple lately that I think are promising. 

Coppertone Pure &amp; Simple SPF 50 (this has a whopping 24.08% zinc oxide content)

And

Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 (20% zinc oxide)

And 

Ethical Zinc SPF 50+ (22% zinc oxide)

I haven't used any of these so I can't speak to the elegance or application, but they look promising.

The takeaway is, look for a mineral sunscreen that is SPF 50 AND contains 20% plus zinc oxide. The zinc oxide should ideally be ""non nano."" Those are the key things. I think you'll find that there aren't that many on the market, as I did. Zinc oxide is just extremely difficult to formulate with and 20% zinc oxide often renders a sunscreen completely unwearable.

Another thing to consider is using a tinted sunscreen, either as your primary sunscreen or a second layer. Tinted sunscreens usually contain iron oxides (this ingredient will start with ""CI"" on the ingredients list.) Iron oxides protect against wavelengths of visible light that play a role in the development of pigmentation.

More seriously, the USA have a real problem with a lack of real democracy.

Even if you ignore the legal bribes that are the campaign contributions, the gerimanderring, the electoral college, all of them big major issues, there is another major problem that is hidden in plain sight : the fact that there is only one round for the big election.

How many time have I read someone says that they had to vote for the lesser evil because a vote for a 3rd party would be a vote wasted ?

Two things about that : eitheir it is true, or it is not.

If it's false, then we have a system where people believe incorrectly that you can only vote for the 2 major parties.

Even worse, if it's true, then it means that you can only vote effectively by chosing the candidate of one of the two major parties.

Remember back during the soviet era when it used to be a joke saying that you could you wanted vote for any candidate as long as it was a candidate vested by the communist Party ? It wasn't real democracy back then, and only being able to vote for candidates for two different partie is only marginally better. Having old parties die and new parties emerge is part of a healthy democracy, it means that when you are really fed up and ""none of the above"" is your choice, new -viable- options can emerge.

But here in the good old USA, when you want ""none of the above"" and want to try to vote for another option, the very system tell you ""no it will have the opposite result of helping the worst candidate according to your belief""

The only way to break this for a start is to still vote 3rd party if you really are fed up with both main parties (of course, if one party still provide a decent candidate then go on), then you can fall back to another option.

Sure it's not perfect, but it would be much better that the current system.
With 2 rounds, the Dems and Reps would nto be able to just say ""I am slightly less worse that the other guy"" because if they do (like they are currently doing) and none of their options are even remotly good, then you can use the first round to send a clear support to a 3rd party, hopefully removing one of the worst option, and if not you would still be able to vote for the lesser evil during the second round, but here in Europe when this happen, the lesser evil (or lesser good when the candidate is at least semi decent) would have to begociate between the rounds with the 3rd party candidate if he wants his official support

A good democracy means that you vote for the candidate you believe is the better option.

Barring that, we owe it to ourselves to ensure they have enough power to halt any further erosion of rights or benefits. This ""we don't owe the Democrats anything"" nonsense is social media propaganda, designed specifically to get people like you to give up and ceding control to the manipulators. Putin loves that activists like you are disillusioned.

I don't owe the democrats anything. Nothing. There has not been a single progressive legislative win in my lifetime. Your party dead-ends progressive policies to protect the business class of this country. Lieberman is a fantastic example. One sacrificial lamb to stamp out progress and your party does not lift a finger the challenge that insubordination, how convenient. 

&gt;""The base"" is a meaningless term in FPTP. Winning swing voters wins elections. Unfortunately, there are plenty of on-the-fence Democrats or conservative Democrats who identify with Blue Dogs. We are a big-tent party and so we have to find common ground with folks like the Blue Dogs. That's how it always has been.

Mhmm. This is why I don't owe your party anything. Your party does not fight for progressives. This is why the republicans can hold so much power. The republican policy makers always throw red meat at their base. Racism laced laws, lower taxes, less social-safety net, wars or what ever you want to cite, Republicans deliver the policies their base wants.

I can count off A Santa-Clause sized list of policies the modern Republicans have accomplished for their base.
I can count on one hand the list of policies the modern Democrats have accomplished for their base.
I can count off numerous times your party has alienated my progressive values. 
It's not worth it anymore

That's why people don't turn out. Give Drumpf and the red hatters a simple majority and they ruin so many things in such a short span of time. That is what political conviction looks like. Disagree with their policies all you like, Republican politicians move the core party agenda forward and with great haste. Just look at the rate McConnell approves of judges and contrast that to 2008-2012. 

&gt;Because most of the party isn't involved in the nitty gritty details at that level. We have to defend weak Democrats. Winning purple states was the key to victory in the last midterm and it must continue going forward. Purity tests and drawing lines is how you dissolve the big tent coalition that is the Democratic party and end up with even less power.

Then why did Claire Mccaskill lose? She was a weak democrat that leaned far right instead of left, a very Machin-esque senator, and lost. The coalition dissolved itself when the country gave your party power and leadership did very little with it. Again, I will cite how hard republicans fight for shit, even with a simple majority. There is politicking involved in politics ya know? Look how Trump passed his historically awful tax bill, where was the republican super majority?

&gt;We gave them a tenuous and fleeting majority, and they gave us the health care plan that could pass with that majority. Again, why do you expect them to deliver more than what is within their power? They are not magicians. If we couldn't get it done (give them a strong majority), we cannot expect them to get it done.

There is plenty that can be done in the executive branch to change things in very influential ways. One example would be to mandate that all federal supply contracts for items like office supplies to first aid kits be purchased from US producers when available. That is something that is currently not mandated and that is in the executives jurisdiction, Trump did it for a single day or month? I don't remember the length. 

Again, I do expect Dems to fight when they have power, just like the Republicans do. Trump's tax cuts were passed with a simple majority through budget reconciliation. Do you expect change if one party is full of tenacious ruthless politicians and the other party is filled with conflicting views and no sense of unifying message? Good luck with that.

&gt;This ""bully pulpit"" shit is more social media propaganda. This aint the 1940s, the inherent power of the presidential pulpit is all but gone given the media environment.

Not bullshit, we see the republicans do it all the time. Look what happen to Republicans who oppose Trump. It works. When the president threatens to help any primary challenger against a dissenting incumbent, politicians fall in line. Democrats don't really support challenging incumbents. Just look at the AoC-Crowley, they were even going to try and run him anyways after he lost the primary until the story blew up.  

&gt;He didn't actually say he would veto it. He said he would ask how is it paid for, a common criticism of Sanders' plan. And that he wouldn't do anything that would jeopardize people's access to health care. Which sounds to me like he's in favor of a combined public and private system like many European countries have. It's just that progressives have planted their flag behind medicare for all and nuance is seen as defeat.

Sounds like a pocket Veto to me. If he does not agree with the bill, which he has said he does not because M4A will get rid of everyone's insurance and he does not want to gamble on that right now. 

&gt;Don't you see the problem here? It was youthful exuberance disconnected from the reality of what was possible. Being young and thinking you are going to change the world seem to go hand in hand. It turns out that the world is a lot bigger and a lot more immovable than it seemed. But this isn't a failure of the Democrats, this is just the fact that progress tends to happen one funeral at a time. Activism can be the difference in enacting policies that are razor close to passing. But its not going to change hearts and minds to any large degree.

I don't think you see the problem. I am not asking to change the world. I am asking for us to keep up with the rest of the modern world and we are falling behind. I know politics is a lot of sausage making, hence my political activism from an early age. The majority of Americans want M4A 

https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480719-poll-narrow-majority-favors-medicare-for-all

This is not pie in the sky and unpopular. Other countries have it and most of us want it! Pretty simple and straight forward. The problem is that the party that should be fighting for M4A as a core proposition, with unblinking conviction, is also sold out to the healthcare industry and compromises even a public option away. 

This is why I owe your party nothing. It gives scraps to it's base while asking for political loyalty. The republicans score policy win after policy win and cross another bullet off of the policy list. I never thought in my lifetime Abortion rights were on the chopping block, look how far McConnell has pushed that item. There is no single one issue the Democrats where they move mountains to accomplish a dearly held goal. The ACA was the closest thing and it was originally the Republican solution to healthcare in the 80's:

&gt;I admit you've done far more than I ever have or will ever do. It's because of people like you that we have the progress we do. But one thing to note about major progress is that it tends to coincide with social upheaval. The new deal would not have passed without the great depression, for example.

While I appreciate that you say that, I don't feel that we have progressed at all from a legislative perspective. Do you honestly think a NAFTA supporting candidate will be able to recover the rust belt at all? It's such a huge damn liability in crucial swing states and now we have a real crisis on our hands. I am honestly in favor of super delegates putting anyone in that did not vote for NAFTA, dealer's choice!

We need major progress and we are going down the 2003 path all over again. How do you not see this? Biden is Kerry all over again. 

&gt;This is just to misdiagnose the problem. ""The DNC"" didn't do anything against you. Democrats simply are not as progressive as you would hope, despite what you read on social media. There are far more Democrats or potential Democrats like Biden than there are Bernie. This is the reality of the electorate, and thus our politicians and policies are a reflection of that.

Amy and Pete both dropped out within two days of Super Tuesday and both endorsed Biden. Warren left Bernie high and dry weeks after ST and will most likely be in Biden's cabinet for her services. That was a unified establishment left vs a divided progressive left. Looked damn intentional to me. I would think the establishment wing of the party were stupid if they did not do that. It was the most logical path forward to help a moderate win.

If I was magically advising both Warren and Sanders, I would have had them rally together at some point, who ever was in the lead after super Tuesday. It's a smart political strategy and if you don't think that is what happened, I have a bridge to sell you. Plenty of backroom dealing going on for those day-before endorsements.

Jesus fulfils perhaps the most specific prophecy of the Messiah in Daniel 9:27 -&gt; ""And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,""

There is no question that Daniel 9 references Jesus the Christ. How do I know this? He came at the exact time prophesied. Let me back up a little bit.

24Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.25Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.26And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.27And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.

This command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem met its ultimate fulfilment in the arrival of Ezra in 457 BC with the decree of Artaxerxes. The sabbatical cycle was restarted at that time. The prophecy specifies 70 weeks. Now from 457 BC until Messiah the Prince would be 69 weeks. Using the well established prophetic day year principle, 69 weeks is 483 days which means 483 years. That brings us to the fall of AD 27, when Jesus began His ministry at the age of 30. In the midst of the final week, the Messiah would be cut off but not for Himself - His life was given for fallen man. Jesus died in the middle of the 70th week. The end of the 70th week brings us to AD 34 when Stephen was stoned with one Saul later called Paul assenting. This Saul is later given word from God that ""he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel."" Before then Jesus had given the command to go only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel. Now the command was given to spread the gospel among the Gentiles but God did not forget His chosen people. Paul was still to preach the gospel to the children of Israel but no longer was the command to largely restrict it to them but to preach the gospel to all.

This also fulfills Isaiah 49:6 - ""And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth"" Truly salvation has come to every nation on Earth not through OT Judaism which is largely restricted to Israel, Europe and Western nations with only 17 million adherents (the vast majority not being converted Gentiles) but through Christ who is preached in every nation on Earth, sometimes in secret to avoid the government, but with billions of followers of all ethnic backgrounds.",True,False,False,,,0,1585748138,,False,0,{},fm476k6,False,t3_fspa62,False,True,t3_fspa62,/r/DebateReligion/comments/fspa62/jesus_is_not_the_messiah/fm476k6/,False,,1592814687,1,True,False,DebateReligion,t5_2snuc,r/DebateReligion,public,,0,[],

What really got me to understand what's happening in China is this: 

Sure, China has 2 billion people. But it's not just a pile of people, it's people living on a territory, in different provinces. Imagine China is the equivalent of the whole of Europe, and every province is like a country. Under normal circumstances, people travel freely between provinces. But when they locked down Wuhan, they also put a stop to inter-provincial travel, which really reduced the spread of cases. 

The equivalent would be if the EU, for instance, would've closed all country borders at the beginning of the outbreak. 

Now, how early did China react? If you check out this really good [video from Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk), they have a graph with numbers of cases and the timeline. And according to that graph, they shut down the city on January 23, after only seeing 440 confirmed cases. The video also shows that by then, there were already over 12,000 infected people (who only got tested later, when they started showing symptoms.)

In comparison, Germany shut down borders around March 15, when there was already over 20,000 confirmed cases in Italy and 4,000 cases in Germany. 

That's for the numbers. The other part is how effective the lockdown was. On top of all the technological stuff like scanning health codes and mass SMS alerting residents of positive cases, there's also a social aspect. 

I don't think it's easy to understand to what extent people stayed home, if you've never been in China and understand how people live. 

The lockdown happened around Chinese New Year's, which like christmas and new year's in the West in that it's almost a full week of holiday. People were already off work, and the holiday got extended. They couldn't travel back to their hometowns because of the lockdown (thank god). 

Chinese people in big cities live in ""apartment blocks"", which is basically a gated community of multiple buildings on a giant block. These blocks have security, and the security guards would send you back home if you were out for no reason. Possibly even fever checks at the gate. Where my relatives live, there was only one gate open to get in/out of the block (of like 20 buildings). My grandma, for instance, goes out daily to walk the dog but hasn't gone out of the gates in weeks. 

People wear face masks, which is may not be the best tool to protect yourself, but really reduces the risk of you infecting others in case you're asymptomatic. (Ironically Chinese people do believe the masks protect themselves which is why they wear them.) 

Temperature checks at supermarkets, and at work once people started going back to work (outside of Wuhan). My uncle and aunt's office would issue face masks for workers, and that's in a province with only about 150 confirmed cases. 

Also, people have gone through other big outbreaks and know how deadly these infections can be. On top of that, China is just generally gross and people are much more careful about hygiene (like, don't eat anything off the floor even in your own house, only squat toilets in public places because people think it's gross to sit where other people sat, etc.)

it's demonstrably false. Falcon 9 and Heavy barely reached half of Ariane and Proton payloads and a third of delta iv heavy. SpaceX still has to demonstrate their rockets heavy lift capabilities. Same for seats prices, it only holds if you don't include the upfront payment they asked NASA.

Prima di tutto, quando la situazione era ancora molto gestibile da un punto di vista dei numeri hanno lasciato liberi tutti di fare quello che volevano.

The culture card has been pulled on a lot of Turkish kids in Europe as an excuse to not allow them better education.

I have cousins in The Netherlands and how the system works there is as follows:

At primary school they do a test called CITO and according to their scores and a combination of a lot of complicated stuff an ‘advice’ comes out, which determines the high school level. The levels at high school are VMBO (low), HAVO (medium for future bachelor degrees) and VWO (high for future uni degrees). 

Many schools and teachers (not all) abused the ‘advice’ system to give Turkish kids lower high school levels and because the parents didn’t speak Dutch properly and didn’t understand the system, they managed to put Turkish kids at VMBO or HAVO, even though their test scores were more than good enough for them to go to VWO and get a uni degree in the future.

While many Dutch kids went from VWO to uni, Turkish kids had to go to VMBO or HAVO and progressed all the way to uni by jumping through additional hoops which Dutch kids didn’t have to jump through. Often, Dutch parents could discuss with the teachers and get their kids the right education they deserved, but Turkish parents were ignorant and didn’t speak the language because they spent their years cleaning toilets or working in factories while the Dutch parents were well educated and knew the educational system inside and out.

What happened is that you had a whole generation of Dutch kids who quickly progressed from VWO to Uni and a huge group of Turkish youngsters who went to VMBO, progressed to HAVO in their second year at high school and then had a HAVO diploma. With that diploma they had to get a 4 year bachelor degree and on my after that they could go to uni. So the Turkish uni degree holders were always a bit older than the Dutch uni degree holders which had a negative effect on the Turkish uni degree holders who applied to jobs. On top of that, having the name “Abdullah” on your CV instead of “Hans” or “Mark” also had a huge effect.

When I lived in Holland they did a test by sending the exact same CVs with a muslim name and a Dutch name and 90% of the time the Dutch named person was invited but the muslim name person was ignored or turned down right away. Now there are companies in Holland who remove names from CVs to overcome this.

Things are getting better and European countries are not racist all the way, but racist individuals who work in education or HR/hiring departments at companies have lots of power to push their racist agendas.

They were perhaps cunning. But cunning is not synonymous with ""intelligence"". Thieves, for example, are cunning, as are rats. But their cunning often leads them to trouble and their own peril very quickly. 

American military might is inextricably tied to its (stolen) resource base. The notion of using the biggest club the world has ever seen to clobber others is not a sign of intelligence. The biggest idiot in history would have the same impulse. Point of fact,  dropping atomic bombs on millions of civilians during the period in question is probably the greatest act of tactical, military and foreign policy stupidity in history.

The European ability to steal the land from the very peoples that kept them alive for their first many winters is, again, not a sign of the outstanding intelligence that you claim.

I would also argue that the left has always been a champion of individual freedoms more so than the right and history has proven that time and time again (Civil rights, Nazis, Facists) Your idea that the liberal western leftist wants state controlled everything is an ideological farce invented by actual authoritarian figureheads that want to radicalize the right.

YOU can absolutely hate Trump and also hate Xi and the CCP while defending Chinese against hate crimes. I would never defend Xi. But most certainly I would attack trump for just being a complete idiot and using hateful rhetoric as a way to rally his base. There have been hundreds if not thousands of hate crimes that have acquiesced due to Trump saying “China” virus. It’s literally the same crap Xi is pulling in China.

And to be fair, we saw the writing on the wall when China shut down their country and yet we refused to acknowledge how serious this was. Oh yeah it’s easy to blame China now for hiding this crap, and they should get blame for not accurately reporting their numbers, but they literally shut down their entire country and we just blindly accepted it as a way of life there, ignoring the warnings until it got out of control in Europe. And by then it was too late. I wonder why your conspiracy laden articles on Drudge Report won’t report that?

Rather, it would mean mutualising any new debt generated by the fight against the pandemic


But then ESM is the better choice because it can specifically help countries that have been affected. 

It's not as easy as he makes it sound, because Italy's old debts influence the rates at which it can borrow money and it has to pay higher interest rates than countries like Germany or the Netherlands - that's why these countries have an issue with that. 

I definitely don't want to paint Italians and Spanish people as lazy, because that's just not true, but if you think about the European countries as siblings, it's as if some got lucky, some made good investment choices, some made sure the people they rented to paid their rent; and others got a bit unlucky, or an investment fell through, or their rentors refused to pay. 

If all of these siblings go to the bank seperately, the bank will offer them very different interest rates, with the unlucky ones having to pay more interest on their loans, making it even harder to get out of a slump. That's how the market works, but it can be seen as unfair because it keeps someone down who is already not doing so well. 

On the other hand, if all the siblings pool together for a loan, they'll get an average interest rate. That's potentially ""fairer"", but it means that the luckier ones have to pay more interest on their loans than they would have had to normally. 

I understand both sides, but I think shared bonds need one fiscal union. It's not unfair for the siblings with lower interest rates to say ""okay, let's take a loan together, but then let's also find ways to make sure all our rentors pay their rents (/our whole population pays taxes)"".

There are six factions with different relations between themselves. They're basically the merchants, the police, the sailors, natives, science-heavy middle east and religion-heavy europe. The latter two are at war. 

You're the cousin to (and work as a Legate for) a governor who is part of the Congregation of Merchants, who tries to stay neutral to all of them.

I'm curious if anyone else here has read the research that led to this project; I actually remember reading a piece by Hudson back in college while getting my dust-gathering IR degree. Turns out the piece is available on WomenStats site (""The Heart of the Matter: The Security of Women and the Security of States""). I'm pretty sure this is the research at the heart of the project.

I've gone back and re-read it, and there are a couple gaps in the otherwise fascinating introduction that I'm struggling to wrap my head around, chiefly that Hudson and company don't touch at all upon the history of Colonialism as a potential factor in why only Europe provides suitable security for women.

It seems too great of a coincidence to me that the states that managed to lay groundwork for women's security and involvement in civil society/governance - ie the states that come closest to breaking free from the society-wide reproductive strategy of patriarchal violence that then leads to instability, as per the project's thesis - are also the wealthiest and furthest from intra-societal competition over basic resources as well as the beneficiaries of colonialism, imperialism and their legacy in the current global economy.

Interestingly, these researchers seem to intentionally divorce feminism from critiques of capitalism and colonialism. The following quote, for example""

""Interestingly, several theorists believe that the rise ofdemocracy is rooted in the amelioration of violent patriarchy. For example,some have posited that the social imposition of monogamy and later marriage
for women (leading to a lessening of gender inequality) were necessary,though not sufficient, conditions for the rise of democracy and capitalism inthe West"" 

... IMO leads to uncomfortable questions the researchers don't ask. Why did that evolution only occur ""in the West?"" What does it mean that ""the West"" kept gender-equality evolution and democratic evolution solely ""within"" while inflicting debilitating violence - including sexual violence - on societies with which it was at war, up until the last few decades when forms of neoliberal interventionism that don't risk the global flow of resources became feasible? 

I'm a layman who tries to read what he can, so I def don't know the intricacies of how feminist and Marxist theory intertwine or clash, or if feminist theory as a whole is currently moving away from Marxist critique as a complementary framework, but completely avoiding it in your introduction, even if to explain why it's *not* a part of your theoretical framework, seems like an intentional choice given the historical relationship.

There's also the chance that this 10-year old paper isn't completely up to date on the research team's findings, of course. Just curious what others who know more - or can correct me if I'm wrong in my impressions - think. My impression of this sub is that it would not agree with the neoliberal prescriptions the researchers suggest elsewhere on the site, but that doesn't mean their thesis, methods and conclusion - that societal violence is rooted in interpersonal gender violence - isn't true.",True,False,False,,,0,1585753715,,False,0,{},fm4gkg2,False,t3_fsf4a3,False,False,t1_fm10sac,/r/FemmeThoughts/comments/fsf4a3/the_womanstats_project_fate_of_nations_tied_to/fm4gkg2/,False,,1592819146,5,True,False,FemmeThoughts,t5_2ucc3,r/FemmeThoughts,public,,0,[],

&gt; Wednesday 13 is a horror punk band, fronted by Wednesday 13 of Maniac Spider Trash, Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13, Murderdolls, Bourbon Crow  fame. The group formed in 2004 and continue to play.

&gt; The genre of music is a mix of death rock and punk with lyrics heavily inspired by horror movies. All music and lyrics are written by the vocalist Wednesday 13. All guitars, bass, keyboards and vocals on the recordings are by Wednesday 13. Coner drummed on their debut album, whilst Kid Kid and Piggy D provided some back up vocals.

&gt; After Wednesday 13's primary band the Murderdolls went on hiatus, he went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March 2004, called the ""Graveyard A Go-Go"" tour. For his live performances he was joined by members of Florida horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent.

&gt; When Wednesday 13 returned to North Carolina in June 2004 he began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform with under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in a former Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13 member Ikky on guitar. The band took heavily influenced by the likes of KISS and Alice Cooper, while at the same time not straying far from the band members previous horror punk related projects. In September 2004 Ikky was replaced with Matt Montgomery also known as Piggy D.Together the Wednesday 13 band toured Europe in November 2004 on the ""Look What The Bats Dragged In"" tour, some of dated were supported by English rockers Viking Skull.

&gt; In 2005 after touring, they released their debut album ""Transylvania 90210"", and made a promotional video for the track ""I Walked With A Zombie"", the video depicted the band members in footage from the original Night of the Living Dead horror movie. Following the albums release the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom; ""Tour from the Crypt"".

&gt; Also in 2005 they played on the main-stage of Download Festival at Donington, but perhaps the crowning moment for the group so far was when they opened some shows for their idol, Alice Cooper around Halloween.

&gt; Wednesday 13 parted ways with Roadrunner Records, before signing a new deal with Rykodisc, which then released a new album on named Fang Bang on September 12th, 2006.

&gt; During March and April of 2006 all of the members of the band parted ways with Wednesday 13, first the bassist Kid Kid, to concentrate fully on his solo project. It was announced that Argyle Goolsby of Blitzkid would be filling in at three live shows, before the band found a permanent replacement. Then 13 announced that guitarist Piggy D and Ghastly had also left the band, 13 stated that he maintains an amicable relationship with all the former members and wished them luck.

&gt; On the band's official website, 13 wrote that there would be a special Wednesday 13 line-up for a Cancer research benefit concert, and the following gig. This line-up brought Wednesday 13 and his Murderdolls band mate Eric Griffin back together for the first time since 2003. Griffin took on guitar playing duties, also joining him was drummer Racci Shay and bassist Brix from the band Dope . It was later announced that this line-up, aside from Brix would be permanent. After Brix left the band Nato Manor joined the band on bass. And after Eric left the band a much more talented guitarist J-Sin Trioxin joined the band.

&gt; In the middle of Europe tour 2007 Racci's dad died and so he was replaced by CombiChrist drummer until the end of the tour. And because Wednesday was still recovering from injuries they got a second guitarist.

&gt; 
The Band toured in early 2007 with Vains of Jenna, and recently announced a summer US tour with The 69 eyes, Fair to Midland &amp; Night Kills the Day

[],,JasonMadsun,1513723189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ox3g2qj,False,False,[],"Eu já adiantei a conclusão, então vou apresentar as premissas:

1) O discurso no qual o Presidente chamou o Covid-19 de ""gripezinha"" de ""resfriadinho"" foi um desastre total e colocou ele em rota de colisão contra o Ministério da Saúde, Governadores e a maior parte da Sociedade Civil, vide panelaços que incluíram até eleitores bolsonaristas arrependidos, e inclusive coincidiu com a data do discurso no qual o Comandante do Exército, General Pujol, que disse à tropa sobre a seriedade e a gravidade que o desafio do Covid-19 representa para a nação, ou seja, o presidente descreditou o Ministro da Saúde, o Comandante do Exército,  os  Governadores e Prefeitos, criando, assim, uma dissonância cognitiva nacional.

2) O presidente está politicamente isolado, aliados, outrora fervorosos, estão se afastando dele; Quase a totalidade dos governadores estaduais estão contra o presidente. 

3)  O vice-presidente já desautorizou o presidente ao falar que o governo federal só tem uma posição ""isolamento social"", e ao gesticular reprovação da fala do presidente, na qual o Bolsonaro criticou o Dória durante a reunião com os governadores.

4) O Ministério da Saúde comprou a briga e não tergiversou no posicionamento de que o isolamento social horizontal é medida necessária para enfrentar a crise. Os demais ministros também tomaram partido e apresentaram discursos condizentes ao do Ministro Mandetta, vide Sérgio Moro e, até mesmo, Paulo Guedes.

5) O formato dos painéis ministeriais apresentados pelo Ministério da Saúde foi alterado. Agora as apresentações são lideradas pelo Ministério da Casa Civil, que é do General Braga Netto, quem coordena todas as perguntas e respostas da apresentação. Curioso observar que quando a imprensa perguntou ao Ministro Mandetta se  a demissão dele já estava sendo cogitada \[afinal, o próprio Presidente disse que se fosse criticado o demitiria\], o Ministro Braga Netto interrompeu o jornalista, cortou o Min. Mandetta, e respondeu  que ""Não há qualquer conversa no sentido de demissão do Ministro Mandetta"". Só que em seguida, o próprio Ministro Mandetta retrucou: se a imprensa pergunta e governo diz que não existe, é porque existe \[a intensão de demiti-lo\]. Vale conferir esse trecho do painel interministerial.

6) O último discurso do Bolsonaro não tem a assinatura do Carluxo. Na verdade, sequer parece um discurso dele, pois carece de elementos característicos como ofensas, indiretas, acusações e argumentos infundados. Parece uma correção de rumo, o discurso do presidente se amoldou aquele do Ministério da Saúde. Nas palavras de Gilmar Mendes: o rabo abanou o cachorro. Suponho que a ala militar tenha tomado a frente do governo nos bastidores, mormente pela centralização da atuação Ministerial nas mãos do General Braga Netto.

7) Menos importante, porém algo que não deve ser ignorado, é que o próprio Olavo de Carvalho já cogitou ser tarde demais para qualquer reação do governo Bolsonaro.

A minha hipótese é que os militares já assumiram a presidência nos bastidores, porque há claramente um estado de anomia, criado pelo próprio Bolsonaro. O presidente perdeu o governo. A palavra dele caiu em descrédito e a presidência dele, em meio a maior pandemia dos nossos tempos, é uma tragédia anunciada. Em um momento que é preciso coesão nacional, uma voz uníssona que assegure à nação de que ""vamos passar pela crise"", você  tem o presidente contra tudo e todos. Os militares sabem, ou deveriam saber, que o prognóstico para o pico da crise não vai ser nada favorável caso o presidente não caia na real e volte a seguir os mesmos passos que estão sendo tomados pelo Ministério da Saúde, governadores e pelos principais países do mundo. O Presidente tentou, mas perdeu a queda de braço contra tudo e todos.

Enfim, por  se tratar de uma mera suposição, a conclusão de que os  militares já tomaram as rédeas da presidência da república, ainda que implicitamente, deve ser tomada *cum grano salis*. Vamos o discurso que está para sair hoje, quarta-feira, se ele voltar a atacar como fazia antigamente, pode desconsiderar tudo o que eu disse. Mas se o discurso for novamente ""sóbrio"", e em comunhão com o que tem sido dito pelo Ministério da Saúde, então, haverá mais  um reforço à essa hipótese, de que os militares já tomaram as rédeas da presidência.",True,False,False,,,0,1585756180,,False,0,{},fm4l5pb,False,t3_fso6vt,False,True,t1_fm382ux,/r/brasil/comments/fso6vt/em_pronunciamento_bolsonaro_volta_a_distorcer/fm4l5pb/,False,,1592821359,2,True,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,r/brasil,public,,0,[],

Your comment was definitely not entirely wrong or anything, but it's *completely* blindsided to the more violent/negative elements of the spread of Christianity.

And now I see a strawman argument against some ""christianity is literally evil and never did anything positive"" argument I've never made. Won't even respond to that, I'll only show some things that counter your narrative of the christian transition being pretty much peaceful ""like the current atheist transition"".

A one minute Google search is already enough to find at least a few examples  of why your ""christianty spread peacefully, not unlike atheism today"" is complete nonsense.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/catherine-nixey-darkening-age.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/catherine-nixey-darkening-age.html)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_pagans\_in\_the\_late\_Roman\_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_pagans_in_the_late_Roman_Empire)

You're the type of person who'd say things like ""it's due to Christian Monks that most of Roman texts have been preserved"" while completely ignoring that mass book burnings by christians are partly the reason we lost 90% of the texts in the first place. They're disingenuous half-truths. Mixed with blatant untruths like ""temples were not destroyed"".

I also like how you ignore that practicing paganism was punished by death in Christian Rome and instead ""counter"" by asking questions and saying broad things like ""Ancient Rome always had the ability to take influences from other cultures"". Yeah, about that. Rome had freedom of religion, with many pagan religions and also Judaism living together in peace. Christianity first had this freedom too, but later was the only religion to be persecuted. Wonder why... because they *couldn't* live in peace and respect other religions like the rest.

And again these disingenuous half-truths about ""coexisting"" in Northern Europe. There were crusades in which pagans were killed or forcefully converted. Of course this didn't mean the entire population would magically become devout Christians overnight. Pagans endured in the rural areas especially, where Christian governments had less power projection. Christians systematically tried to erase paganism by forbidding traditions where they could and Christianising them where traditions were too popular to be banned. There were also more violent campaigns like ""witch"" hunts (if you didn't know, within Northern paganism, women had the role of keeping pagan traditions alive and teaching them to children. ""Witches""). These were all measures to actively wipe paganism off the map and Christianise the population. Insofar they survived, they didn't ""coexist"", but *endure.*

About the Barbaric invasion, they tried to reinstate pagan rights. Many local pagans that were left actually joined this insurrection. The Eastern Roman Empire launched an assault on them and eventually executed the barbarian leaders that sought to reinstate religious freedom. After the Eastern Roman Emperor installed his own leader in the West, he created very harsh anti-pagan laws.

Your comparison with the current social change towards atheism would work if:- we had an authoritarian atheist government that banned christianity on the punishment of death and actively tried to turn christians atheist.- all churches were closed and either destroyed or transitioned into libraries or something.- the christian population was forced to go underground and persist this way, while still persecuted.- all of christianity was constantly propagandised as ""evil"".Just to name a few things

But sure, this local workshop made pagan stuff too, therefore there wasn't a large scale anti-pagan movement going on lol

I mean, what do you expect from people who actively murdered even christians with different interpretations? People that destroyed catholic art en masse because it was ""too pagan""? What would you expect these people to do with actual pagans and actual pagan art?

Let me just quote a bit from the first:   
 

*So why don’t people like being asked what they do?*

*Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.*

*Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.*  

*Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.*

*Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on divorce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.* ",True,False,False,,,0,1585759400,,False,0,{},fm4rdia,False,t3_ft15nq,False,False,t1_fm4mzod,/r/etiquette/comments/ft15nq/it_is_so_rude_to_ask_about_someones_job_or/fm4rdia/,False,,1592824363,9,True,False,etiquette,t5_2r6p3,r/etiquette,public,,0,[],

* Segundo: se não for circuncidado (se não tiver pele que cobre a glande, que é o capacete do bombeiro), desempacota a cabeça pra não ir mijo pra todo lugar quando/se balançar Isso diminui exposição à urina e melhora a mira.  

  
* Terceiro, depois que acabar de mijar, ao invés de balançar o pinto e espalhar mijo pra todo os lados, você pega na base do pau (bem acima das bolas)e e aperta a uretra (que fica na parte debaixo da rola) e puxa até a ponta. Isso vai diminuir as gotas pós mijo porque você está praticamente esvaziando a mangueira. Igual bombeiro faz com mangueira profissa pra não apodrecer. Pode ser que você acabe com um pouco na mão mas é só mais um motivo pra lavar as mãos de novo. Mesmo se não pingar, por favor lave as mãos.  

  
* Aqui é que o negócio complica. Se for no mictório, nao tem papel higiênico e vai ter que balangar mesmo. Não deve sobrar muito se você der a espremida. Se for no vaso estiver papel higiênico disponível, é melhor secar a ponta do que balançar: menos mijo espalhado e o pau fica seco. Depois de secar não deve ser necessário balançar.  

  
* pau seco é melhor porque fede menos e dá menos problema. Tem nego que tem muita pele ou pele muito apertada e deixar seco evita complicações.  

  
* No banho, lava o pinto direito puxando a pele, com agua corrente e sabão. Pinto não é auto limpante e se não lavar direito vira fábrica de queijo polenguinho (QUE NÃO É NORMAL).  

  
* Pra receber um boquete, o melhor é lavar com sabão e água ANTES do boquete. O(a) dono(a) da boca dando boquete vai apreciar a não ser que tenha fetiche de mijo ou polenguinho.  

  
* Como bônus, você pode pedir pra namorada, esposa ou peguete pra fazer isso pra você. Não é pra qualquer um mas mulher nunca teve que fazer isso e pode achar interessante.

In some cases you reviewed the outcome of your own predictions more favorable than I would. 

I think there's room for improvement wording predictions. Currently some are too vague, giving them a wide bandwidth of interpretations. This renders the judgement of the prediction afterwards tricky. See some [examples highlighted in yellow here](https://i.imgur.com/S7w2NZm.jpg). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some are only loosely supported by the provided sources. Some are stamped as ""came true"" by stretching (or ignoring) the meaning of the quantifying words ""a lot"", ""severe"" and ""massive"". 

I must admit I'm not a up to speed of the situation in the US (I live in Europe), but I've got the impression it's not the general view that above specific quantifiers are currently met. Happy to be corrected on this.

&amp;#x200B;

The prediction on the amount of *deaths by the end of 2020* can obviously not be judged at the moment, and should be made separately from *deaths by the end of March*.

&amp;#x200B;

More in general: editing a post with predictions a few days later potentially makes the (perceived) value of the predictions lower. Incoming first time readers could suspect the predictions have been adjusted in the edit.

Put the predictions in a numbered list. This facilitates ease of discussion. 

Use absolute times/dates (or ranges) instead of relative. Write *before the 1st of May X will have happened* instead of *in a couple of weeks...*. It's more concrete and also facilitates future discussion.

They came to Ireland and mixed with the natives of the South and West, who themselves are supposed to have been of low type and descendants of savages of the Stone Age, who, in consequence of isolation from the rest of the world, had never been out-competed in the healthy struggle of life, and thus made way, according to the laws of nature, for superior races.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Scientific_racism_irish.jpg)

Does this count? It is clearly claiming the ""Irish Iberians"" to be more similar to ""Negroes"" than ""Ango-Teutons"".

What about this bit in Benjamin Franklin's infamous essay:

&gt;Which leads me to add one Remark, that the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny; Asia chiefly tawny; America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians, and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who, with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we, in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? Why increase the Sons of Africa, by planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

It specifies who Ben considered white - Irish is not listed either way, but considering Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians, Swedes and Germans (well, *most* Germans, a convenient exception made to the Germans that conquered England at some earlier point because that would make his whole point a bit awkward by excluding a bunch of Englishmen) don't make the cut I think it's safe to assume he wasn't particularly inclusive of the Irish in his definition, either.

Do you not think it's weird that anti-Irish sentiment invariably connected them to [apes](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8908225c711a8ad58e36e334a4f050a/tumblr_n2l6cg3Sdo1sjg84qo2_640.jpg) and [monkeys](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2dd91ad6afea408b004428bf3635703/tumblr_n2l6cg3Sdo1sjg84qo6_640.jpg)? Do you really think the message here was too subtle?

**Knockwurst, or knackwurst**, is a thick sausage that originated in the Holstein (northern) region of Germany in  the mid-16th century.. Knockwurst contains ground pork, veal, occasionally beef, and garlic. These ingredients are then put into a casing, aged for a few days, and smoked over oak wood.

**Boiling Knockwurst**

1.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a large pot 3/4ths of the way with water. ... 
2.Turn off your stove. Let the boiling water settle for a minute or two. ... 
3.Place the knockwurst in the hot water for 10-15 minutes. ... 
4.Remove the knockwurst from the water. ... 
5.Serve the knockwurst with garnishes

**Pan-Frying Knockwurst**

Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil into a saucepan. You can use olive, canola, or peanut oil to fry your knockwurst. If you want to inject more flavor, sauté onions in the oil before you cook the knockwurst.[12]

 If you sauté onions before cooking the knockwurst, remember to season them with salt and pepper.
 Cook the knockwurst for 10-15 minutes. You can cook the knockwurst whole or cut
 into pieces. As you cook the knockwurst, turn them regularly to ensure an even cook
throughout. The outside of the knockwurst should be brown.

**Sauerkraut**

Sauerkraut is finely cut raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria. It has a long shelf life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid formed when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage leaves. This is done by simply adding salt.

Although ""sauerkraut"" is a German word, the dish did not originate in Germany. Some claim that the Mongol Emperor Genghis Khan brought it to Europe. Others claim that it originally came from China and surrounding areas and that the Tatars brought it to Europe, and improved upon the original Chinese recipe by fermenting it with salt instead of rice wine. It took root mostly in Central and Eastern European cuisines, but also in other countries including the Netherlands, where it is known as zuurkool, and France, where the name became choucroute",True,False,False,,,0,1585760182,,1585771070,0,{},fm4suv7,True,t3_fswa2e,False,True,t3_fswa2e,/r/tonightsdinner/comments/fswa2e/tonight_i_had_knockwurst_with_1747_maille_mustard/fm4suv7/,False,,1592825080,1,True,False,tonightsdinner,t5_2qxea,r/tonightsdinner,public,,0,[],

As i said, israel is thriving. We faced war on all sides from the moment we came  into existence. As the years progressed we became a powerhouse despite being at war, and we also managed to make peace with those that were willing. All the while creating a diverse democratic society with freedom of religion, expression, the press, and political expression. It’s an amazing history we have.

 If they can’t accept that Israel is here to stay, they’ll lose the ability to determine the borders of their two states. We’re sick of the conflict. It’s meaningless. Israel will determine borders unilaterally and that will be the end of it.

Like, what is the point of your argument if we are all related? individual genetic legacy wouldnt be a thing that biology wants to maximize so  evolutionary fitness would not be a reason to monogamy. 

The Khan data is not merely related, it is direct male descendents. This happens due to systemic longlasting legacies of power that monogamy would never achieve. And it isn't just genghis Khan, but even without individual genetic data of powerful men in history, genetic signals of such men reverberate in the population data for centuries and millennia. We dont have genghis Kahn's dna, but we see its clear signal in population genetics. Again, not merely related, but a direct male descendents as a significant proportion of a population as a result of many generations of hundreds of children, systemic depopulation and controlling the sexual access of other men. Turns out to be a good individual strategy for genetic legacy and fitness, generally pretty miserable for society. 

Bloodlines dont last without maintaining that kind of systemic power, including sexual access. Even the european feudal powerhouses of the post-Black death dont boast genetic lineages even fractionally large as khan or other patriarchs because of monogamy and their limited childbirth rate and survival to adulthood  just does not compete for the kind of extent of genetic legacy. Many such powerful families actually go extinct in their patrilineal lines, not form a sustained impact on world population genetics. Like, these are the wealthiest and most powerful people who have fathers that have the most to invest in their limited natural children and they dont survive monogamy.

Individual survival rate of contemporary monogamy (or evolutionary psych theoretical paleo-monogamy bs) doesn't trump hierarchy and patriarchy and murder for genetic dispersal. Again, this doesn't mean patriarchy is good, but it does caution reifying contextual facts like how monogamy materially benefits children in heterosexist capitalist societies (through their exploitation by extremely wealthy families and limiting women's freedom) and turning it into biological fact. 

There is a lot more going on in fitness than raising direct descendants. However, your argument for fitness of monogamy over patriarchy does not stand at the individual decisionmaking level.

In Europe the advantage is less, but in Europe with a Tesla you can also use any CCS charging station too. Tesla still has the largest unified charging network of 100+ kw chargers in Europe.  The closest thing to it is the ionity network which is growing but 224 charging stations with vast majority of them being 4 chargers vs 519 stations in Europe with an average of 9 chargers per station. The distribution is also much better for Tesla. **Compare the maps for Tesla vs ionity for Italy/Spain/Portugal/western/southern France.** https://ionity.eu/ https://supercharge.info/map

Now yes there are many 3rd party chargers and a lot of 50 kw chargers, but 50 kw charging sounds downright miserable, and reliability is a bit spotty. Of course you can use them with Tesla too. 

The other factor is Tesla has extremely cheap rates compared to any other fast charging network in Europe, often 50% less. The difference can be significant, on the order of 7-15 euros per 100 miles or so. 

In America there is only electrify America as a real alternative which is extremely expensive and has mediocre reliability and coverage of less populous areas.

350 kw stations sound cool, but remember for electrify America that’s split between two chargers, and for ionity it’s not 350 kw for any car unless it’s 800V. Otherwise it’s 175 kw. That may or may not be an issue depending on what automakers do. Tesla certainly has more than one v3 in Europe so not sure where that’s coming from but it’s not accurate. Obviously coronavirus is slowing down all infrastructure projects currently.

Of course the biggest thing is having more cars that can charge at 150+ kw. As it stands, very few cars can charge at that speed.

Five cases of coronavirus have now been reported by the health ministry in Syria. The country is subject to a curfew from 6pm to 6am as of March 25. Syria braces itself for a potential medical crisis. 

The Syrian healthcare sector has been crippled under a “maximum pressure” economic sanctions campaign that has collectively punished the Syrian people for the duration of a war waged against them by the same governments inflicting the catastrophic economic damage. Hospitals and medical care centers have been targeted and occupied by the extremist armed groups throughout Syria, further reducing the Syrian state-ability to deal with the looming threat of an apparently rapacious pandemic. 

Sanctions increase the risk of pandemic spread
All measures taken against the Syrian government by the UK, US and EU are ostensibly to “protect” the Syrian people. Of course sanctions never protect the people, they deprive the people of basic needs, they decimate essential infrastructure. They are designed to weaken the target state or leadership, to turn the people against the government, to serve US-led foreign policy agendas in the region. Sanctions enable war and destruction, they are taken to bring resistant nations into line with horrifying consequences for the civilian population. 

Instead of lifting sanctions to allow nations like Iran and Syria to combat what is described as a “global pandemic” that threatens the lives of all Syrians and Iranians according to the media hype – the US-led coalition of “humanitarian” intervention is effectively doubling down on their pro-sanction, pro-war rhetoric, as a recent statement from the UK, US, France and Germany has demonstrated. Former UK Ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, described the statement as a thinly veiled cry of solidarity for Al-Qaeda in Syria, “There is not a word here with which Hayat Tahrir Ash Sham, the dominant jihadi group, would not concur.”

White Helmets weaponize Covid-19 to ensure Syrian people suffer more
The Al-Qaeda-linked White Helmets group have sprung into action to defend the sanctions regime and to effectively condemn the huge majority of Syrian people to further misery should the pandemic take hold in Syria. An organisation with a history of collaboration with the US Coalition-sponsored armed groups in Syria, itself funded by the same governments, has been triggered by the billionaire-manufactured PR complex that manages and directs this shadow state construct.

We have seen a flurry of activity on their Twitter accounts, their primary platform, promoting the White Helmet “coronavirus” campaign. This is nothing short of cynical exploitation of a world crisis to weaponize it against the Syrian government via an entity that has served this purpose since its establishment, in Turkey, by a former British military intelligence officer, James Le Mesurier. 

The White Helmets have published a statement calling for sanctions against Syria to be maintained. The statement is based on misinformation and duplicitous narratives including the claim that Syria and Russia are deliberately targeting hospitals, omitting that these hospitals are invariably taken over by the Al Qaeda-dominated armed groups in areas they control – converted into terrorist triage centers, prisons, courts, military centers and torture chambers. 

Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was recently given a platform in the Senate to “[feed] the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the talking points that it should adopt.” Saleh’s highly politicized speech is echoed in his tweet, instrumentalising the coronavirus crisis to further amplify the talking points historically and fraudulently used to criminalize the Syrian government while airbrushing Nusra Front/Al-Qaeda from the Syrian conflict landscape. 


White Helmets are neither neutral nor humanitarian
So, in summary, the White Helmets, a supposedly “neutral” “humanitarian” organisation are sustaining their donors “maximum pressure” campaign against the Syrian people they claim to support. If the White Helmets were anything other than an extremist, propaganda construct implementing the US Coalition “regime change” policy against Syria, they would have demanded a ban on sanctions to enable the country to collectively deal with the coronavirus crisis. 

The White Helmet organisation should be condemned for effectively enabling mass suffering and death in Syria, not only by providing cover for internationally designated terrorist groups, but, now, for endorsing sanctions that will ensure the perfect conditions for a global pandemic to spread like wildfire through a “hybrid warfare”-decimated nation.

No one thought that Canada would become  a nation that supported globalization and free trade after the first Trudeau. We eventually got politicians like Brian mulroney, Mike Harris, Preston Manning, and Stephen Harper. Now we are at a point where trudeau 2.0 supports free trade and is building pipelines for Alberta (however hesitantly). These would have been unthinkable positions 50 years ago. Politics can shift significantly. It takes time.

&gt;For not personally supporting infanticide, he was slandered. For not personally supporting the price movement, he was slandered

So was Harper. Scheer waffled, and ran what was the weakest campaign put forward by the federal conservative party. 

&gt;Social conservatism is dying in Canada, because the neoliberals SUPPRESS dissent

Most social conservatives in Canada are also very neoliberal economically; they support free trade, low tax and less regulation, and decentralization, giving more power to the provinces. Unlike the US, they recognize the need for some social services.

&gt;Extremist” politics of the left are commonplace in Canada.

Its not extremist compared to the US, europe, or most western democracies.

&gt;he was slandered

Welcome to politics. Do any work for political parties, even on a volunteer level, you'll get used to it. You need a thick skin.

&gt;because the neoliberals SUPPRESS dissent. They control the media. The schools. The narratives. They are in power indefinitely.

Neoliberal is not synonymous with progressive. Most social conservatives won't be onboard if you oppose free market policies. Progressive *social* narratives are common and will take decades to change. Canada has actually.moved right economically in the last 30 years.



&gt;I mean it is merely a neoliberal dictatorship, regardless of whether people recognize this or not.

Canada is the one of the oldest oldest continuous constitutional democracies in the world; number 4, I think. Just because you call it a dictatorship doesn't make it that.


Revolutionary political change fails in Canada every time. Think about the times any actual armed revolution occurred:

* upper and lower Canada rebellions in the 1840s
* Fenians
* Louis Riel 
* FLQ
* OKA crises

Riel wasnt arrested; John A Macdonald sent the police, army and cannons to deal with him. A ten man terrorist cell resulted in martial law and mass arrests of political opponents by Trudeau 1.0. The full.might of the state, backed by public support, was brought out, whenever rule of law was challenged.

&gt; Nicolas Jaar is a Chilean-American composer and recording artist based in New York. Nicolas Jaar was born the 10th of January 1990 in New York but spent most of his childhood in Santiago de Chile, only to return to his place of birth as a teenager. Haunted by Mulatu Astatke, Erik Satie, Ezekiel Honig and Villalobos’ “Thé au Harem d’Archimède”; Nico started to make organic electronic music in 2004 at the age of 14.

&gt; At 17, he debuted with ""The Student EP"" on Wolf + Lamb Music, with remixes by Seth Troxler and Kasper. At 18 he continued producing and played live at Club der Visionäre and Arena in Berlin, at the Marcy in Brooklyn and at Mutek in Mexico City, alongside Deadbeat, Flying Lotus and Guillaume &amp; the Coutu Dumonts, amongst others. At 19 he studied at Brown University in Rhode Island. Nico has many releases coming up, including some on Circus Company, Wolf + Lamb (with remixes by Ryan Crosson) and on his own label, Clown and Sunset, of which he is the owner and founder.

&gt; Jaar then spent four years in underground dance circles, crafting rough, hip hop influenced house music (examples include ""Love you gotta lose again"", ""Angles""). Initially made as jokes to make his mother laugh and dance, Jaar made two songs where he sang in his native Spanish (""Mi Mujer"" and ""El Bandido""). Jaar did not intend for them to come out. He changed his mind in 2010, as he felt the songs were his way of answering to what he deemed as exploitative sampling of Latin American culture by white European DJs.

&gt; He released his debut album, Space Is Only Noise, in January 2011 to critical acclaim, receiving a score of 8.4 and the title of Best New Music from Pitchfork [5] and four stars from the Guardian.[6] It was ranked #1 album of the year by Resident Advisor, Mixmag, and Crack Mag.

&gt; Jaar toured the album for three years with guitarist Dave Harrington (later of Darkside) and keyboardist Will Epstein. Jaar was voted # 1 Live Act on Resident Advisor for the 3 years he toured the record.[7]

&gt; In 2012, he debuted a live concept called From Scratch, where, in front of a live audience, he samples records he bought that day. The first iteration happened in Queens, NY at MOMA PS1; it was a 5-hour concert with collaborator Will Epstein, videographer Ryan Staake, dancer Lizzie Feidelson and singer Sasha Spielberg. He has also performed From Scratch at the Museum of Modern Art in Denver, Colorado and Montreal.

&gt; On May 18, 2012 Nicolas Jaar made his BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix' debut,[8] which was voted Radio 1's Essential Mix Of The Year of 2012.[9]

&gt; On October 4, 2013, the debut album from Darkside, Jaar's project with longtime collaborator Dave Harrington, was released to critical acclaim and a 9.0 score on Pitchfork.[10] The band toured the record for the entirety of 2014.[11]

&gt; In February 2015, Jaar released a largely ambient record entitled Pomegranates, which he intended as an alternate soundtrack to The Color of Pomegranates.[12][13]

&gt; Later that year, Jaar scored the soundtrack to Dheepan, a thriller by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard about a family of Sri Lankan refugees living in the suburbs of Paris. It was the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2015.[2]

&gt; Jaar is the owner and founder of the New York-based imprint Other People. Notable releases include works by Lydia Lunch, DJ Slugo, William Basinski, Valentin Stip, VTGNIKE, Lucretia Dalt and 12z. Although the label predominantly releases vinyl, it also offers a membership where fans can download new releases and gain access to the entire Other People archive for $4 a month. Other People only publishes creator-owned content and splits all profits made from records sales 50/50 with artists. Read more on Last.fm.

I may be wrong, but I think part of why you see this topic differently than most is because, as an Italian, you thankfully come from a country that wasn't heavily involved in post-Enlightenment era slave trading. My goal today is both to differentiate that form of the slave trade from other slave economies that predated it, to explain how racism played a part in its operation, and to discuss how white Europeans were ultimately responsible for driving this trade. 

&gt; Slavery is a basic result of human interaction, is embedded in our innate social strategy...

What you're saying is unfortunately broadly true, as slavery has existed throughout human history, and continues to exist today. However, what's important to consider is how the Trans-Atlantic slave trade (TAST) differed from forms of slavery that preceded it. This institution existed on a scale, and involved a level of brutality and dehumanization, that simply is not matched anywhere else in history. This type of chattel slavery, which treated people as animals and gave slaves no viable route towards freedom, led directly to the torture, rape, and murder of hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions. As much as it might have sucked to be a slave in a place like the Roman Empire, your standard of living, legal protections, and prospects for the future would have been drastically higher than that of a slave in the US or the Caribbean. Making matters worse the TAST was also multi-generational, with the children of slaves also being taken into slavery. This not only increased the numbers of people being impacted by this system, but also created a need for new social systems to justify the continued enslavement, which we'll get to in a second. 

&gt;  ...it's also idiotic to think of slavery as a racist phenomenon and not an economical/social consequence of the structure of the country its established in.

I'll focus on the American South for this part of the discussion, as it's the region I know most about. While you're right that the motivations for slavery were in large part economic, racism played a huge role in allowing this system to survive, and at times outweighed other concerns. To understand why this is the case, we need to first understand that contrary to what many people might understandably think, racism against black people was not why white Europeans took them as slaves, [but instead developed *after* these people were already being enslaved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#Legacy_of_racism). Some early justifications for multi-generational enslavement, like religious and cultural differences, lost their usefulness as the decedents of slaves largely converted to Christianity and began to share the general culture of the people who enslaved them. The rise of racism, and the notion of white racial superiority, became the social tool needed to justify the preservation of the chattel slavery system. Moreover, racism became critical for maintaining the cohesion of slave holding societies, like the American South. The presence of a large slave labor force was actually economically devastating for the majority of white southerners, many of whom were relatively poor as the result of either being forced to economically compete with large slave plantations, or because the only work they could find was assisting on these plantations. Slavery in the US really only directly benefited a small minority of hyper wealthy white slave owners. However, racism provided a social incentive that prevented poor white Americans from trying to dismantle American slavery, despite its existence being to their clear disadvantage. So long as whites were viewed as inherently superior, even the poorest white farmer was given a spot in the social hierarchy above black Americans, and thus they supported slavery, even as it lowered their quality of life. 

The tricky part about this racism, is that at a certain point it stopped being a justification for an economic need, and instead became a freestanding monstrous force. Again looking at the American South, as the industrial revolution began sweeping through the US, Northern American manufacturing economies began to significantly outpace the Southern agrarian slave economy. While cotton growing was still profitable, it would have made sense for the South's economy to make a significant pivot towards industrial production, but it didn't. Giving up the plantation system for industrial plants would have required giving the majority of black slaves more advanced vocational training, at least a limited education, and having them work alongside white laborers as relative equals, all of which went expressly against the South's social system of white supremacy. Moreover, poor white southerners did not push for industrial jobs, despite these possibly being a route towards greater wealth, in part because doing so might have jeopardized their social standing in comparison to black slaves. Economic progress was delayed as a fairly direct result of the slave system and the racism used to perpetuate it. This problem jumped into even sharper relief during the Civil War, when poor white southerns voluntarily fought and died in the thousands to defend slavery in their states, again despite the fact that slavery economically disadvantaged them.            

&gt; Most slave trader outside the us were black , most of the times specific tribes that used the population of nearby territories to use as products to trade with the more developed states since they had no economical product actually competitive with the foreign markets.

I want to try to deconstruct two parts of this view, as I think most people in the US and Europe aren't given a full picture in their schooling of just how dramatically the TAST changed West Africa. Before the slave trade, West Africa was dotted with numerous kingdoms that were wealthy, fairly politically stable, and at the very least self sufficient, if not actively engaged in productive trade. Slavery was a part of this region's economy, but its use was limited, came with legal protections for slaves, and slaves were usually able to earn their freedom in the span of several years. When Europeans began arriving on the West African coast, they were looking for slaves not because the West Africans had nothing else to trade, but because the European powers were facing an absolutely crushing labor shortage in their colonies in the Americas. Native American peoples were dying too quickly to be used as slaves, and European settlers couldn't be enticed to take on physically brutal plantation and mine work. As a result, Europeans were suddenly willing to pay a very high price, and trade highly valuable goods, for human cargo. This sudden economic incentive sparked a cycle that would begin shredding West Africa. 

With the new demand for slaves, Europeans were now willing to trade firearms and gunpowder to African kingdoms that participated in the TAST, which had not been widely made available before. These newly armed kingdoms used their acquired military might to take over their neighbors, thus gaining new slaves that could be traded for further weapons. This rapidly plunged West Africa into a perverse arms race, in which every kingdom needed to engage in the slave trade to obtain the weapons required for their defense, lest they be defeated and enslaved themselves. Hyper-militarized kingdoms sprung up, with economies centered on trading slaves for arms, and ripped through other societies, many of which had existed for centuries. As war became commonplace and a significant part of the population was enslaved, the local economies of West Africa were absolutely devastated. It became extremely difficult to maintain even basic agricultural production under the constant threat of being kidnapped by slavers during a raid. Making matters worse, the TAST led to a huge loss of population in West Africa, with entire regions being stripped of their working age population. The situation was so bad that West Africa's population stagnated during the TAST, and only began to increase again once the trade ended. 

White Europeans benefited from, drove demand for, and at times exacerbated the intensity of slave trading in West Africa. Without their influence, we have little reason to believe that slavery in this region would have grown into the terrifying economic and political force it became. Moreover, it's not as though the Europeans were ignorant of the damage they were causing. African rulers repeatedly reached out to their European compatriots, both to request they cease using slaves in ways that broke the laws of their kingdoms, and later to express the absolute devastation being driven by the slave trade. Many of the European powers had a had at least some understanding of the consequences created by their desire for slaves, but often justified the continuation of the TAST through the use of racism. If the allowed themselves to believe that they were inherently racially superior, it created a permission structure to completely forego normal diplomacy with the kingdoms of West Africa, as engaging in slave trading became their perceived right as a ""superior race"".

What about ALL mass shootings, and what about compared to other countries (taking into account population differences of course). Also what time period is that in?

Sorry for the late reply. Ok let's see some of this wall of text piece by piece. According to WaPo, about 1200 Americans have died in all public mass shootings since 1950 TOTAL. To compare, around 2500 Americans drown each year. Let me know if you need me to find the WaPo article. Compared to other countries per capita, our mass shootings are not extraordinary at all:

[https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-us-leads-the-world-in-mass-shootings/](https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-us-leads-the-world-in-mass-shootings/)

It gets even better for the US when you don't just count mass shootings, but mass killings generally, because then you have to include things like the European truck attacks.

&gt;Defensive gun use per year? Maybe that’s the statistic. Doesn’t take into account whether a gun was necessary, just whether it was used, and also doesn’t take into account times in which with stricter gun control the situation would not have occurred in the first place

But again, we've added millions more guns since 1990, but homicide has fallen by 50%. So you're basic theory that more guns = more crime totally falls apart. I'm not saying I have definitive proof that more guns = less crime, I do not. But the whole premise of the gun control movement is that when guns are plentiful, crime rises. Well, we've added literally tens of millions of guns since 1990, but our crime rates are at historic lows.

&gt;Accidental gun deaths below 500 a year? That’s 500 people first of all, and if the other statistics are questionable as a defence then what did those 500 people every year die for? And again, compare those rates to other countries.

Accidental deaths under 500 a year is incredible considering we have over 100 million gun owners. What other outdoorsy activities have accident rates that low? Think of all the things you could ban that would save lives, using your logic. For example, vehicle offroading kills about 600 people per year, even though far less people do that activity than own guns.  [https://www.rhllaw.com/2016/05/26/6-staggering-statistics-about-off-road-vehicle-a/](https://www.rhllaw.com/2016/05/26/6-staggering-statistics-about-off-road-vehicle-a/)

&gt;But also can we just backtrack a second how many of the people who are shot in self defence die?

You are barking up the wrong tree with this. If it is legitimate self defense, i.e. someone's life was in danger through no fault of their own, then I'm glad that scumbag they had to kill is dead. It means they can't try and hurt anyone else.

&gt;Also, % of population and gun users for everything? What are they. How do I put it into perspective? Numbers mean absolutely nothing unless they are put in context and compared to others.

Polls consistently show 30-40% of Americans report that they own a gun. How many lie to pollsters is unknown.

&gt;Similarly I posted this not because I think people should have the horribly lax access to guns they currently do in America, but because they should know that a government is supposed to serve them and they should do something if it does not and they should not be afraid to do so. Perhaps that was the original purpose behind the second amendment, but time has both passed and changed and it does not serve that purpose in modern society.

And how the hell do you propose forcing a tyrannical government back into compliance with its people without guns? While there have been some bloodless revolutions, they are the exception, not the rule. Venezuela banned guns in 2013, and now only Maduro's thugs have them. Hong Kong is also beaten into submission because they can't shoot back. You literally posted about killing everyone in charge when those in charge abuse democracy, but then started screaming foul when people rightly pointed out that requires an armed populace.

&gt;Again, you are holding on to the illusion of freedom, when the actual picture is horrifying to anyone not brainwashed by your society and I’m sorry you cannot see it.

I have a safe full of guns, have for years, as my father did before me, and we have never hurt ourselves nor anyone else other than some birds in hunting, and some paper and clay targets for recreation.

He wanted to keep her from dying, not being her back from the dead...  which is exactly what Rey did to Kylo (who had a life threatening injury), and she didn’t die.

If such cloaking tech existed on the transports, then why wasn’t it used on other ships; or at least a variant that would prevent tracking.  They had enough “fuel” for another hyperspace jump, so why not prevent the tracking and then jump.  Her plan leads to more plot holes.

Plus, how would Poe’s mutiny ruin Holdo’s cloaking plan?  As if the mutiny suddenly prevented the transport ships’ ability to cloak?

Plus plus...  if Holdo had merely informed Poe of the plan in the first place instead of being vindictive over Poe’s attack, the mutiny wouldn’t have happened.  It’s simple... “Here’s the plan Poe.

Yes they did.  Lucasfilm didn’t abolish Legends entirely until it was owned by Disney.  My point with it is that Lucas respected the EU and allowed it to thrive.  As soon as Disney took over, it was abolished.  Borrowing from the EU to defend Disney is like using Dragonball GT feats to defend things in DBZ.

The reason people have no problems with EU things being adopted under Lucas is the same reason people don’t mind Toriyama adopting EU things in Dragonball.  They are the original creators.  Lucas also used aspects from the EU in planned out stories.  Disney has used them as bandaids for poor writing and severe lack of planning.  People also don’t have problems with powers in the EU because most the EU creators have a lot of respect for Star Wars and don’t trample on it’s legacy for money...  unlike Disney.

2) [What was the national socialist german workers party in the beginning?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f37wtl/what_was_the_national_socialist_german_workers/)

3) [Ideological factions in the NSDAP?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/en2w9p/ideological_factions_in_the_nsdap/)

I have a keen academic and personal interest in National Socialism and 20th century politics in general, though I have a much wider breadth of knowledge in National Socialism than the latter. I also feel it is necessary to disclaim explicitly that I am not a National Socialist in any way.

I believe this qualifies me for the general ""European History"" or perhaps ""Military History"" categories and would like my specific flair to say ""National Socialism | German History 1918 - 1945"".

I hope that you will consider me for flair! If I do not yet meet your criteria, please just let me know what else I can do. I look forward to offering more contributions!

Cheers,

 WHO, the Surgeon General,  American Medical association and their EU equivalents,  aren't doing this because of random fake Chinese statistics (which btw the data from before the lock down is recognized as fake by the WHO as well so you're just comparing fake data against other fake data...).

There's an entire field of study related to it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology

That's the whole goal.   If your local hospital can only treat 100 people and you have 500 susceptible people in your area (just low easy numbers to make a point realistically cities have tens of thousands of susceptible people) the hope is a quarantine will slow it so instead of 170 sick people requiring beds in the first weeks you slow it so your hospital can meet demands.  Because it's been shown time and time again that *emergency triage* have way higher fatality rates then a well operated hospital.

“But experts say exemptions on paper alone are not effective. The broad designations on Iranian banks and companies have made any form of trade with Iran risky and complicated for international companies.”

Which clearly means that, like I said, sanctions make it harder for Iran to buy medical supplies. But it is a by-product, not the function. This is because companies don’t want to go through the special channels that are available if they are unfamiliar with those channels and financial institutions see it as more trouble than its worth. 

Personally, I’m for lifting sanctions until the pandemic is over. But I’m not naive enough to think that Iran is using this pandemic to try and leverage the situation to get the sanctions lifted and as soon as they are lifted they are going to use that time to do whatever the can to strengthen their regime.

trap music meets trapezoids i think might be saying the same thing as dots and lines. geometry = shapes like a trapezoid, makes up the natural laws that we live by. geometry is based off of lines to make those shapes, like a rappers lyrics aka LINES make up the worlds and things they create/promote/glorify etc etc...  So a rapper with lyrics and meaning behind their songs vs dumb trap mumble lazy rap bars.  So if trap music meets geometry, or if trap music and geometry meet you/your ear, do you pretend to give up/not enjoy the trap music anymore even though deep down some dumb trap shit is what you wanna listen to? Is trap music a form of ""sacred geometry"" itself?  Does trap music need to die or evolve?

Not sure exactly what he is trying to hit here but i think its something around these questions, especially since the actual song breaks down to have the trap type beat towards the end paired with the jazz music.  So is lupe himself trying to bridge that gap with this song, or his music as a whole, or is he saying that someone should do it, and combine what he brings with his lyricism and put it over trap beats so that maybe someone who has a bigger audience than lupe can ""save the children"".

If it's not practical, what exactly does that prove? Regarding taming zebras, first of all, eagles are not zebras. There are a handful of examples where people were able to put zebras to work. But these are rare, and only happened when Europeans came who were already on horseback, and thus could catch them in the first place. So to domesticate this creature, you first need to have already domesticated s rideable creature. [Here's the article on found on it](https://thomsonsafaris.com/blog/taming-zebras-domestication-attempts/). 

Regarding Hyenas and foxes, animals needed to be useful to humans for humans to want to domesticate them. Wolves started hanging around people to eat their scraps, and started defacto guarding them, and moved on to help people hunt.  Hyenas are scavengers because they're shitty hunters. They move in after a hunting animal has left, or chase away a cheetah or leopard from it's kill.  They're ill equipped to take down gazelle or wildebeests. 

Foxes are lone hunters, so they don't know how to work in groups, and because they're  small, any prey that a they can kill isn't going to feed your tribe. A possible use would be pest control, but cats were the popular choice because African wild cats(from whom house cats are descended) instinctually bury their waste. It's why cats use litter boxes and dogs don't.  Foxes were only recently domesticated at a Russian fur farm, and it was only possible because they were going through hundreds or thousands of foxes a year.

Trudeau's administration under-estimated the spread of this virus back in January. There were people back in January who were arguing that travel bans to control the spread of this virus was racist. Meanwhile our government backtracked and decided to do it anyway mid-March. In a very connected world with lots of airline travel like we have now, a virus with a R0 of 2-2.5 is inevitably going to spread worldwide if you don't restrict international travel.

My order of preference would be United Biz 100k, then IHG, then Bonvoy.

Reasoning: 

* Under the current award chart, the United 100k is worth 1.5 one-way partner J trips to the EU. Cheapest you could reasonably get away with that paying real money is $1200, likely much higher ($3k+ for some partner airlines like Swiss). And if you fly United with any regularity, the card is effectively free ($95 AF minus $100 credit for booking 7+ United flights). Note that this is the offer ending tomorrow, not Bonvoy (that one ends 4/8).

* IHG is an all-time high offer that's basically worth about 2 free nights at top-of-the-top IHG hotels, or lots more at cheaper ones. The annual free night for $89 makes it a likely long-term keeper too.

* Marriott 100k can take you a good ways, especially in Thailand/Indonesia. The offer just isn't as impressive relatively speaking. They've had 125k offers in the past and the Chase Marriott ($95 AF instead of $450) was just at 100k a couple months ago. If you're comparing number of nights, this is just 1 to 1.5 nights (depending on peak/off peak) at top-of-the-top hotels.

The reason the west has messed with Iran for near 100y while befriending the saudis is very simple: mitigation of viable threat. 

Iran’s leaders and many of her people profoundly want one thing more than any other: to remake Persia that was. That land is now occupied by Iraq, Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. And Iran if left alone is potentially powerful enough to do just that. If not now then within a decade of re-emerging as a free trade partner. 

Whereas comparatively the saudis lived in tents before oil money: comparatively they have proven to present an infinitesimal threat compared to what Iran would and could do with equivalent power, money and freedom. 

Add to this the fact that many Iranians are deeply racist not just towards afghanis (who are genetically indifferent) but also towards Arabs - who they really look down upon - and especially towards black people - who many Iranians view literally as subhuman. It was no coincidence that Hitler held many top level meetings in Iran leading up to the war. He also gifted the-then ruler an entire propaganda library purporting to prove the superiority of the Aryan race. Lest we forget - Iranians are also Aryan - not Arab. Iranians seeded parts of Europe, long ago. 

Thus there is also the threat of Iran wishing to literally overtake the entire Middle East. And it is a viable threat, given enough power, money and freedom to operate. 

This is why America and Europe have always treated Iran so harshly. It is deserved. As for the 1979 Rev - EUR/US were played and fooled. Khomeini was in exile in France at the time. He saw his chance, told the western powers what they needed to hear, then immediately told them to take a hike the moment he stole power. He murdered most of the people who started that revolution. A revolution within a revolution. 

My point is - there are no good guys in this conflict. Both sides deserve real blame and judgement. But it’s the innocent Iranian people who suffer. 

The ideal outcome - fantasy at this point - is a return to pre-Rev freedoms but within a democratic context. Most Iranians desperately want to live a western lifestyle. Islam never really took root in most of Iran, especially the cosmopolitan areas. Just look at pics of life there before the Rev. The ideal outcome, in a nutshell, is for travel to Iran to feel exactly like travel to eg France/Canada. You can say what you want, criticise who you want, worship what you want (if at all), wear what you want and experience zero legal discrimination based on religion or gender or any other protected class. 

If/when Iran does regain her freedom, she will have to wrestle with her toxic, racist but widespread views because they will be fundamentally unpalatable to the civilised world. But one problem at a time. Right now, the IR holds the people literally hostage. That must be resolved first. 

Only the west can help bring this fantasy into reality. But it must be internally incepted and internally mediated. The west’s help, insofar as it is beneficial, is to keep on weakening the regime. Obama handed the regime a golden ticket with his deal, and in doing so showed his utter lack of understanding of what the regime truly is and wants. He made things far, far worse in my opinion. 

Say what you will of trump. I certainly won’t celebrate him. But he truly does understand what the regime are and treats them exactly as they deserve to be treated. He is the best president - from the perspective of the average Iranian - to come around for a long, **long** time. But of course to say this in Iran will literally get you killed, because speaking Truth in Iran will get you killed. That is the regime in its most honest manifestation. 

So please do some reading before internalising your leftist western propaganda. What you wrote does not relate to any strategy that can help Iranian people. It is at best ignorant virtue signalling and leftist-ideological possession. Neither left nor right wing policies alone can save or even help Iran. A balanced mix of both will be necessary in any event.

Tencent is suffering from a shrinking player base - just look at the EU server, which hardly contains any Europeans anymore, but some 90% Arabs of which a staggering number are using hacks.

All Tencent can do is to ban users, and 5 minutes later the hacker is back with a new name.

New hacks are coming out with every update, and they get better at avoiding detection every time.

This will eventually kill the game - and thus the revenue stream for Tencent.

I am pretty sure, that they would LOVE to get an instrument to make a clean game. Which is better for business - having a number of hackers that scare away the majority of players, or losing those guys and preserving a massive player base?

&gt; French (le français [lə fʁɑ̃sɛ] ( listen) or la langue française [la lɑ̃ɡ fʁɑ̃sɛz]) is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted.

Now to top it all off Siam in the south decides they want a piece of me too and heads right for my capital, Rome. So I’m now fighting the 3 front war I didn’t want.

Trump called it fake news and a Democratic hoax, he says he won't return calls to governors that don't sufficiently kow-tow, he said a week ago he wants the country open and churches filled by Easter despite all modelling and all other countries' experiences contradicting that.

If you don't think he's a liar then I don't see how you couldn't think he's at least willingly saying untruths or contradicting experts on a whim simply because he thinks it sounds good for his re-election prospects (or whatever, as you say the motivations aren't particularly important). At the most charitable, he's just the biggest sufferer of the Dunning-Kruger effect US politics has ever seen.

If you believe he's a master thinker then missteps like suggesting in his national address that cargo from Europe would also be subject to bans, which created huge impacts to the stock market are difficult to find a place in your narrative.

It can't be a lack of access to resources, he's the POTUS. So is he either mentally incapable of processing what he's been told... or is he intentionally choosing to not convey it or take the actions that logically follow (which I would personally call lying).

I'm not commenting on what kind of person he is, but I don't think you can dismiss his motivations when in the same breath you're making assumptions of others. When I see that interview I see a reporter asking for accountability for a statement. If he's not going to ask that question, who is? If no one does, then sounds awfully like behaviour of Soviet/Chinese/North Korean/choose your favourite dictatorship in terms of controlling the media.

I get the frustrations with the established two-party system, but Trump has only served to further entrench this, by forcing people to extremes. It's my feeling, anecdotal evidence only though, that people are now gravitating to Biden, as they did with Clinton, simply because they see them as the higher probability option, and they're desperate to stop what they see as extremist positions in Trump. 

This I believe is a natural progression because Dems have needed to be not too far left of Republican stances historically to give greater chances of winning. This is also why Dems of 2020 are now to the right of Nixon from 50 years ago.

You state you don't like being lied to, so can you tell me who is lying to you here in these DC power structures you refer to, and how it's not the guy saying it's a hoax, then just a flu, then that people will be in churches by Easter?

Modifying personal behaviour, be it through social distancing, or hygiene or treatment of symptoms has been shown as the most effective - indeed the only - tool against the coronavirus. If Trump was told of this, which he probably was in January, but definitely was in February, then surely the effectiveness of these are a function of how the President communicates that to the nation. By downplaying it, instead of controlling it as was seen in many other countries, the US now has more than double the next greatest number of cases worldwide, and third most deaths. 

So why is it not reasonable, in your view, to question why he downplayed it as just a flu when worldwide evidence showed the contrary? Why shouldn't he take responsibility for the excess deaths that will result?

I could accept that he decided that economics were more important and to ignore evidence and recommendations in the hope a miracle would occur, or even, if you like a conspiracy theory, because he wanted things to get really bad because then he can use this to change national policies on a whim to his own ends (look to Hungary, which is now ruled by decree, if you think that's absurd).

I mean that even sign language morphemes that are visually motivated retain a degree of arbitrariness, in line with Saussure's arbitrariness of the sign. While KSL, BSL, and ASL signs for Egypt are all visually motivated, what exactly the three languages choose to focus on is completely arbitrary. This is seen in large parts of sign language lexicons. For example:

[ASL ""COFFEE""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=415): Visually motivated by grinding coffee bins

[BSL ""COFFEE""](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/coffee): Visually motivated by drinking a cup of coffee

Or

[ASL ""CAT""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=334): Visually motivated by whiskers

[KSL ""CAT""](http://sldict.korean.go.kr/front/sign/signContentsView.do?origin_no=7524&amp;top_category=CTE&amp;category=&amp;searchKeyword=%EA%B3%A0%EC%96%91%EC%9D%B4&amp;searchCondition=&amp;search_gubun=&amp;museum_type=00&amp;current_pos_index=0): Visually motivated by cats licking paws

This arbitrariness leads to [ASL ""HORSE""](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=1057) and [BSL ""RABBIT""](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/rabbit) being signed exactly the same, because both are visually motivated by ears. Obviously, a BSL monoglot would be unable to intuit ASL ""HORSE.""

In fact, sign language iconicity can be arbitrary even when motivated by the same object, e.g. see [the example of ""TREE.""](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin_Thompson4/publication/24187244/figure/fig2/AS:341483514286080@1458427422044/The-sign-for-TREE-in-three-different-signed-languages-From-The-Signs-of-Language-p-21.png)

&gt;  And where are you getting that evidence from?

There have been surveys of iconicity across sign languages. In ""Iconicity and Transparency in Sign Languages: A Cross-Linguistic Cross-Cultural View,"" Pizzuto and Volterra showed twenty transparent and twenty non-transparent and [LIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Sign_Language) words to thirty-six Deaf people from six Western European countries.

Most of the non-transparent words were also visually motivated, e.g. LIS ""MUSEUM"" (shape of a rectangular building, like [the ASL cognate](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=4446)) or ""MIRROR"" (surface in front of face, see [ASL cognate](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=1393)). The transparent ones were along the lines of LIS ""HEAR,"" which involves tapping the ear, or LIS ""HUNGER,"" which involves tapping the stomach.

The [results](https://i.imgur.com/m9mrUfi.png) were that while the majority of Deaf participants correctly guessed fourteen of the twenty transparent words, they understood only three of the nontransparent ones. So there are clear limits on iconicity, especially for concepts as abstract as country names where a transparent representation is functionally impossible.

&gt; Think critically, if Jews are matrilineally descended, then obviously there would be interracial marriages, and race mixing as well. After all, the Jewish ethnic divisions exist, and that's a fact. You don't think critically, when things are obvious. Just like my fourth source, the Jewish law, Halakha, which can be from Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite, Ethiopians, and other Jewish communities.

Now read what I wrote:

&gt; When one refers to the Jewish “race”, they are referring to the amalgamation of matrilineally descended Jewish subpopulations which have interbred (to an extend) within the populations of gentiles in the societies in which they are living in.

What you wrote:

&gt; then obviously there would be interracial marriages, and race mixing as well

Yes. Are you saying that I am denying this? 

What I wrote:

&gt; which have **interbred** (to an extend) within the populations of gentiles in the societies in which they are living in

What you are trying to delineate as separate ethnic groups among Jews are actually just subgroups of the Jewish ethnicity. These subgroups are a result of interbred Jews retaining some genetic component of the ethnic group they interbred with. You prove this in your response above:

&gt; You don't believe that female Jews can marry other people of other ethnicity?? The Jewish Ethnic Divisions[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18733/) exist.

Do you even know what you cited? I suspect you are randomly linking verbose studies thinking that I won't be able to understand them, when in reality you are the one that is unaware. Let's pull a quote directly from the article:

&gt; Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.

Did you even read this far? What would this imply? Hmm. It's quite clear that Jews, despite having interbred with separate populations, still retain some form of genetic similarity, meaning that they would have been descended from a common ancestral group. Looking more like an ethnicity to me.

&gt; Second, despite their high degree of geographic dispersion, Jewish populations from Europe, North Africa, and the Near East were less diverged genetically from each other than any other group of populations in this study

What does this imply? Ethnicities are defined by their relative genetic similarity, meaning that they wouldn't have significantly genetically divergent populations within them. Basic logic.


Anthropologists determine human ethnic groups and subgroups through the use of best fit genetic clusters. They do this by compiling and comparing the variation in genetic loci among populations (how specific gene markers differ among populations). Let's take a look at the [genetic variation among human geographical populations](https://pjt111.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/li09pca.jpg?w=630). As you can see, there is a significant and quantifiable genetic variation among separate geographical and ethnic populations. This information has been replicated thousands of times and is commonly accepted knowledge among all genetic scientists. Now, let's take a look at the [genetic variation among Jewish populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=3297573_pgen.1002559.g001.jpg) (source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297573/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297573/) ). The distribution of the genetic variation among these Jewish subgroups is similar to the genetic variation between [Finnish and Swedish subpopulations](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PCA_of_Sweden_and_Finland.png), for example. Why do we consider Swedes to be an ethnic group, even though they have an ingroup genetic variation similar to that of Jews, who you claim are not a single ethnicity? Of course there will be some genetic variation among Ashkenazis and Sephardics, but they are genetically similar enough to be considered a single ethnicity. Just as the genetic variation between Swedish subpopulations is marginal enough to render them to be a single ethnicity.


&gt; The source is an article from UK, which shows discrimination against colored people. Does that mean the UK is an ethnostate for white Europeans?

What are you even trying to say here? White is a race, and there are different, **distinct** ethnic groups residing within the UK. Ethnicity is not race, therefore this wouldn't be an ethnostate.

Eventually, a Syrian National Congress was convened in Damascus, and the Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed, with Faisal I as King. Despite this, the French had other plans, and began to prepare for an invasion to secure Syria as the newest addition to their empire. Despite the numerical and technological advantage of the French, a defiant Faisal I refused to surrender, and mustered his forces for a battle in Maysalun. Using the terrain to their advantage, the forces of the young kingdom achieved a narrow victory, forces the French army to fall back. While this battle proved a huge moral victory for the Kingdom, what ultimately saved the Kingdom was disaster on the Western Front. With the collapse of the Front into open revolution, the French were forced to withdraw to defend their nation from the International Red Army. British forces too would soon be forced to withdraw to deal with the revolutions in Europe and North America, and following the Egyptian Revolution, the British garrisons were forcibly expelled from Egypt, allowing Syrian troops to march south and unite Greater Syria.

Aliás por vezes nem consigo apreciar o que gosto por causa disso. Por exemplo chegas a casa queres estar com a tua mulher (no meu caso) ver um filme jogar um jogo ouvir uma musica, uma coisa que gostas de fazer , mas o facto de teres aqueles pensamentos em loop na cabeça não te deixam tirar partido do que estás a fazer e acabas por não ter prazer nenhum, são esses pensamentos de fundo que se dissipam e ajuda-me a estar ali presente a fazer o que gosto quando quero e a retirar muito mais prazer da actividade. Não é bem não pensar em nada é mais remover aqueles resíduos que não te interessam.

por isso é que faço as tais caminhadas e tenho os meus momentos dedicados a introspecção, é mesmo para organizar a cabeça, para nao me tirar foco ou apreciamento desses momentos, onde passas tempo com namorada, no teu caso mulher, ou a ver filmes, que provavelmente é a coisa que mais gosto de fazer, entre outras coisas. para ser sincero eu também nao sou gajo de stressar facilmente portanto também facilita as coisas ,sou chill por natureza.

They have handled this badly as they have had zero restrictions (up until recently) and just bombarded a population that has no immunity with a highly contagious virus. Really the only numbers you can extrapolate out of case numbers are as a sample for positive to negative. Countries that have control have a low positive to negative. Countries that don't have a high ratio. If you want proper data,  look at ICU rates and death rates.

Your question about ""what is a reasonable amount of money for someone who is rich to pay in taxes"" is really interesting.  I mean, Europe (recently) and the USA (in the 1950s) tried a 90% income tax bracket for extreme income levels and it doesn't work.  People find creative ways to shelter their money or just stop working.  If you squeeze rich people too hard they move or cheat.

I am not in favor of a wealth tax (like Warren or Sanders apparently wanted) because I don't think it's fair or practical.  If someone already earned the money it shouldn't erode over time and I suspect rich people will find a way around any wealth tax (or even just leave to avoid it).

I think that one way forward might be to double down on the inheritance tax.  I know there are kinds of special cases but a reasonable contract between society and an individual might be something like: ""If you make billions of dollars by selling a successful company, etc... then so be it.  Great for you.  We're going to tax you at a regular income rate when you make the money and we're going to prevent you from giving billions to your progeny.""  If you think about it, in essence this prevents the establishment of a de facto aristocracy.  It also solves the problem I started ranting about before -- the fact that too much money is being concentrated in the hands of too few people.

That problem will solve itself, in the long run, if unchecked.  It's really up to the rich people whether this happens peacefully or not.  One essay I read about this topic that I thought was interesting was Ray Dalio's ""[Why and How Capitalism Needs to be Reformed](https://economicprinciples.org/Why-and-How-Capitalism-Needs-To-Be-Reformed/)"".  If you're not familiar with the author, he's a hedge fund self-made billionaire and his thesis is basically that there's too much money concentration and that we don't invest enough in the next generation.

To answer your question directly around how much income is reasonable for the state to take from well-paid individuals, I think we could increase the current top federal tax bracket a bit.  It's 37% for married people on dollars earned past 612k.  Your 48% probably factors in things like state income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc...  But what I think is more important than where the federal ordinary income tax bracket boundaries are is to fill in all the loopholes.  e.g. qualified dividends pay no income tax up to like $110k and then a flat 15% thereafter.  Long term capital gains are also taxed at a rate way below ordinary income.  So people with jobs making money by spending time working a good job get taxed at 30%+ but people who invest money and live off dividends enjoy rates less than 15%.  How is that fair?

That said, I know that ~50% of Americans pay a zero effective tax rate.  That's not fair either -- people should have a stake in the system if they want a vote.  So I'd be all in favor of charging everyone who makes some income a small amount of tax.  It's their contribution to society.

Anyway, I just think that if we as a society did a better job extracting money from rich people we would not have to run so much QE to create new money (and use it to buy more newly issued federal debt beyond the 22 trillion dollars we and our children and their children already owe) to stimulate the economy.",True,False,False,,,0,1585797041,,1585797729,0,{},fm6lsjn,False,t3_fsq0i5,False,True,t1_fm657vv,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsq0i5/you_shouldnt_have_to_pay_taxes_on_land_you_own/fm6lsjn/,False,,1592857149,1,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,,0,[],

The general public tends to be idiots, and our health officials told us masks don't work to prevent hoarding.

The advice is now slowly starting to change, but they still aren't being truthful. 

Not only do mask provide some protection to the wearer, the greater benefit of mandatory masks, is for everyone else. It prevents the droplets that can spread from coughing, sneezing and even just talking. Reducing the risk of contaminated surfaces and breathing in the droplets.

These droplets can linger in the air for over 30 minutes, you don't even need to be in the same room as someone, for them to infect you. All you need to do is walk past where they were even minutes after they coughed or sneezed for them to infect you. The only way to prevent this is through everyone wearing masks.

Just like what countries that have their outbreak under control mandate everyone wear, which you have entirely ignored twice now.

Literally any mask is better than nothing, and there is no logical scenario where they increase risk. Even if someone infects themselves through improperly disposing of it, then they would have been infected anyways, because that means droplets landed on their mask, which otherwise would have been directly inhaled if they were not wearing a mask.

So yes, it is just as simple as masks work. And we have clear evidence of that from countries who've controlled their outbreaks.

&gt;Q: What mistakes are other countries making?
A: **The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks.** This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. **If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.**",True,False,False,,,0,1585797828,,1585798133,0,{},fm6mwxk,False,t3_ft18g4,False,True,t1_fm62fq8,/r/Hamilton/comments/ft18g4/materials_for_homemade_masks/fm6mwxk/,False,,1592857696,1,True,False,Hamilton,t5_2reuj,r/Hamilton,public,,0,[],

If you're going for just the scenery, Switzerland is Amazing but there's not lot else to recommend it. I ended up just driving through it and stopping to take pics but moved on. I much preferred Austria. 

I suppose I prefer places that are more off the beaten path. I nixed a well-planned trip to Great Britain (or at least Ireland/Scotland/Wales) for Iceland, and I don't regret it one bit. And I went to Slovenia instead of Croatia, which has become ridiculously expensive since the GOT phenom. It was an amazing trip, btw. Slovenia is still my favorite--the people are all so nice and welcoming of tourists (unlike France), the scenery is beyond beautiful, the rafting and whitewater kayaking on the Soča were world class and it cost a quarter of what it would have if I'd gone to Croatia. The Pot Miru (walk of peace) is amazing, and a real eye opener, if you like history and you're up for a good hike. If asked, my first recommendation will always be Slovenia, hands down, no contest, no hesitation. IMPO, there's no better place to go. 

If you can afford it (as it's just plain expensive to go at all), and you want cold weather, I suggest Iceland--even in July I was freezing (lol). But go outside the capital up the coast. Iceland is very travel friendly without renting a car with bus services from the airport to all the towns on the coasts. Also, hit the AirBnB spots every chance you get no matter where you go. Unlike the U.S, they're very nice in Europe and very cost economical. 

In any case, I tend to travel on a tight budget just because I'm a cheapskate and I go for the ""experience"" rather than the tourist hot spots. I didn't even go near the Blue Lagoon in Iceland--too touristy.
