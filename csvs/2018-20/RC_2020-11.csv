I like the idea of an underground abortion railroad to get women from places where it's illegal to places where it's legal. What about abortion drones to drop pills to women? Some 25, 30 years ago, I read about Women on the Waves, a European organization that would take women in countries where abortion was illegal, go 12 miles out in the ocean or sea (international waters), and then perform abortions. I think they also do pill drops. That won't work in the U.S. because some of the most hostile states are landlocked. Maybe on Gulf Coast states?

If you're up to a quick Rome, I'd just modify that meme light tank a tiny bit and then produce a dozen, which can kill both Yugo and France within 4 months and &lt;50k casualties in the right hands. And then the good-old 10-0 infantry to hold my now extended line as I fight all across Europe, while I slowly add more punch into these meme tanks. Rome by 1940 at the latest (my first try), and sometime in 1939 if you do it well, and 1938 if you do it REALLY well.

For a later war, 20 width inf should be your backbone. In SP you CANNOT rely on allies so you need to go SF doctrine, which obligates you to the 10-0 template as your main division. You can try 14-4 infantry or tanks, mediums or lights are fine. 5-2-2 is a solid light template for micromanagement, 12-8 is a solid 40 width light tank division that can push and run around, and 13-7 is a solid medium division with SF. No need to mix random things in. Add SPAA or at least support AA if you don't have air.

120k casualties is like all I took during my entire Rome run, and that was with... light tanks, motorized, cav, etc. No advanced weaponry, pretty much no airforce. 60k casualties is all I took during my most recent Barbarossa as Germany. Micromanagement and good divisions always triumph. You shouldn't start a battle you cannot win easily, unless there is a reason, i.e. pin. Therefore you should never get into a situation where you need field hospitals to conserve men. If FH cannot repay its expense on each division, it certainly cannot repay itself over your entire army. It's that simple.

Maintenance costs production. And it increases your IC/hp ratio which makes you bleed more. You're probably unaware of this.

Recon company is useless because the recon stat is useless. it only shifts tactics SLIGHTLY in your favor, and you want the RIGHT tactics to be chosen, which are not necessarily the countertactics anyway. Recon also provides speed bonus, which is useless for infantry because infantry needs to defend, not push. It provides a bit of attack with SF but too expensive to justify that. Therefore recon company is worthless on infantry.

You should rush tanks nonetheless. Stay one tech ahead of the AI helps. Only having 1939 armor in 1939 is something to be ashamed of.

Heavy TDs make space marines which is a very questionable concept, except for a few cases. In most cases the expense is unjustified.

Issues that can exist are:
Ingredient causes skin irritation or allergy.
Ingredient is unsafe for environment or marine life.
Ingredient is a hormonal disrupted or estrogenic. 

Most ingredients are restricted due to potential of skin irritation. For example, if 1 in 100 people commonly experience irritation from a substance left on the skin for a period of time, in the EU and via IFRA, thot ingredient would be restricted. It does not mean that ingredient is dangerous. It means it causes skin irritation to 1% of the population.

Yes there are brands that have poor ingredients. It‚Äôs usually brands that use candle oils or fragrance oils meant for other uses. There‚Äôs brands out there that purchase from fake/low quality suppliers and will list reconstitutes of scents like ‚ÄúGardenia Fragrance‚Äù which have no regards for ingredients. I‚Äôve come across it commonly enough. However, I could argue that the fragrance quality in a Bath and Body Works product is usually equally as poor (and not something you want on your body).

Truly unsafe ingredients are not used in fragrances, or are used in such minute amounts that they have no impact on your biology. Most safety tests are done in massive quantities on mice, so if a mouse develops a tumor from an aroma molecule over a 3 month period by being doused in 3x it‚Äôs body weight in it regularly then that molecule will be restricted or have use regulations.

If you are a woman, you do have to be concerned about ingredients that mimic estrogen. There‚Äôs not many, but it‚Äôs better to avoid them. However, it‚Äôs silly for someone to be afraid of the minute amounts in perfume but eat food and apply cosmetics that are mimics.

I would be far more concerned with cosmetic ingredients which stick to your skin overtime than with perfume which doesn‚Äôt really penetrate.

The natural versus synthetic comment above is misguided. You have the exact same irritation concern with both, however, natural ingredients aren‚Äôt disrupting marine life or your body chemistry.  Issues with thujone  are from consumption (injesting via tea or usually drinking essential oils) not diluted topical application if anyone even does that. 

https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/public-statement/draft-public-statement-use-herbal-medicinal-products-containing-thujone_en.pdf

Natural ingredients do have a risk of photosensitivety over synths but it‚Äôs truly rare. It‚Äôs a myth that ‚Äúcitruses‚Äù are photosensitive, it‚Äôs a myth that every single diy perfume blog repeats. Sweet orange/blood orange does not encourage photo sensitivity, nor do many others. Bergamot in its original form does (and is likely the most used citrus in perfume), and due to the high amounts could be an issue, however it is almost always now the non PS version of it that is used, as it‚Äôs quite difficult to obtain anything else, so it no longer is a cause for concern.

Sadly even the penis thing is true, it's called penile subincision and it's graphic.

However the voters themselves are very likely not (besides the loud minority driving around with their Trump flags).

I'm from France, and it's actually very similar there.

The main difference is that France, as opposed to US, has many more prominent parties. Instead of Republican vs Democrats, we got RN (far right), LR (right), LREM (identified as Centrism but mostly right), MODEM/UDI (centrism), PS (left), FI (far left), Communist, Green Party and so on.

However, in the past 20 years, extremists parties managed to get more popular. Part of it is because they managed to soften up their speech and because the traditional left/right parties get more and more disconnected with the people, making extremists parties look more down to earth.

Interestingly, this pushed the traditional parties to adopt more hard line positions, in an attempt to get back the votes from these extremists parties. In the end, it clearly did not work well, and, in the last election, the traditional parties completely exploded and were replaced by a brand new party. This new party was founded by our current president  and is actually the equivalent of the traditional right wing from a few years ago, just marketed differently.

So now, what do we have? Popular extremists parties that soften up their tone, and destroyed traditional left/right parties that are taking more hardline position in vain.

Does that mean french people are becoming more extremists? Actually no. Most of them have the same ideas as 20 years ago. However, they want to express how fed up they are with politics being so distant from their problems. My own mother voted far right in the previous elections, mostly because of this.

If we go back to America, the parallel exists. I'd say it's even worst because America truly only has two main parties with barely any nuance in their position. It baffles me when mainstream medias are unable to understand why Trump was elected at the first place: because people are fed up with politics and feel that Trump understands them. Trump is a political outsider, and he still is! I would even argue that as bad as Trump was during his presidency, he still has chances to be re-elected for the same reasons: people argue that Trump did nothing, but if you take the position of someone voting for Trump, you can see Democrats playing politics in the House to block every of Trump's moves, and that's what matters!

It's similar to France where one party will try to pass a law that the other party would normally submit themselves, but where this other party will vote against just to prevent the first party to be successful, under the cover that the law is not doing enough. It's pure bullshit, and that's what people do not want anymore.

I talked about France and US, but it's equally true in many other countries. Europe has seen extremisms rising in many countries in the past few years, mostly for the same reason: traditional politics failing to understand people's problem, coupled with economic problems related to free market.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604202776,,1604203231,0,{},garfivj,False,t3_jlvmca,False,True,t1_gardey4,/r/changemyview/comments/jlvmca/cmv_if_you_are_voting_for_donald_trump_in_this/garfivj/,False,,1615919683,3,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

Eu continuei falando com ela ap√≥s isso s√≥ que chegou a um dia onde ela tinha dito que ficou com o amigo dela, amigo esse qual eu sempre demonstrei inseguran√ßa. Jurei nunca mais falar com ela e a bloqueei em tudo (menos no Instagram)

Chorei por dois dias e duas noites at√© que ela manda mensagem no instagram dizendo que tava com saudades e n√£o conseguia viver sem mim. Eu, tolo voltei!

A gente voltou a conversar e eu ainda tinha sentimentos por ela, at√© ela come√ßar a ficar seca e parecer n√£o se importar com minha presen√ßa mais. Ela tinha arrumado algu√©m, algu√©m melhor talvez eu n√£o sei.

Ela sempre postava stts de conversas com ele enquanto eu sempre ficava escondido, como se fosse um bot√£o de apoio na qual ela podia apertar sempre que precisasse. Sabe oque eu fiz??

I am not willing to sacrifice anything and everything to mitigate the problem/I do not necessarily think the benefits are worth all of the proposed costs. 

* By extension - urban redesign (including housing) and infrastructure. I literally drive a 50 year old (give or take a few years) car every day. 

* Guns - I do not support any federal ban on any gun that currently is not federally banned - the single politician who is in favor of this that I‚Äôd vote for is Tulsi Gabbard. I do not support any buybacks, limits on the number of guns one can possess, or mandatory payments. I do support greater background checks, more pre-purchase education/training, greater mental health care, and probably other measures that I‚Äôm forgetting currently. I also wish the NRA would return to its more education-focused position of the past, for all gun enthusiasts. 

* PC culture, *somewhat* - I am black but wokeness makes me cringe, white saviorism makes me cringe, and I do not agree with the common argument that being PC = not being an asshole, but I think people should be respectful publicly and I don‚Äôt really mind the social repercussions of today for saying offensive shit publicly. I think this stems from my belief that nobody will ever eradicate racism from any one country, let alone the world, and that sometimes I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth trying to (remembering the past achievements of previous campaigns/our current better position vs. going about civil rights activism the wrong way, i.e. now) 

* Preserving the Electoral College (not the same as uncapping the House, which I‚Äôve become more open to)

* Immigration, *somewhat* - I‚Äôm pro-DACA and think Dreamers and their parents should all be given a path to citizenship. I thought Trump‚Äôs family separation policy as immoral, though I didn‚Äôt seemingly spend every waking moment of my life after learning about it thinking about it. Further asylum seekers should be strictly vetted and/or our legal immigration system should be as restrictive as that of Canada‚Äôs and a few select European countries. 

* By extension - I do not have endless empathy/a bleeding heart. I can‚Äôt spend all of my time thinking about all kinds of human rights violations in the world. I was born black, but I wasn‚Äôt born an activist. Some people are born a certain way but want to live in the shadows, and that‚Äôs perfectly okay. I was a Bernie supporter circa 2015-early 2016 and got burnt the hell out. Likely stems from my basic belief that this world is cruel, it‚Äôs always been cruel, it‚Äôll always be cruel, and it‚Äôs not really worth trying to fix that. 

* Individualism (over collectivism), to an extent and valuing negative freedom over positive freedom, to an extent. 

* Refusal of service when it comes to businesses, though I‚Äôm not set in stone here - I‚Äôve just had my fair share of sketchy experiences and kind of (again, not set in stone) would rather just know not to enter than set foot inside and feel threatened. 

* Criminal justice, *somewhat* - I‚Äôm not in favor of going totally rehabilitative/restorative - we should certainly make our system much more rehabilitative, but we should still have a punitive aspect. And I don‚Äôt care if people‚Äôs mugshots are online before they‚Äôre convicted of anything.

If people should be happy because others have it worse than we should also be sad because others have it better too, it‚Äôs nonsensical and baffling why this is trotted out so frequently as though it makes any sense at all.

Suppose scenario X and Y are both bad, but Y is worse than X. What, should X be happy then because their bad situation is less bad than Y? Nonsense, they will of course both be unhappy.

The US is a dumpster fire for the poor ‚Äî minimum wage hasn‚Äôt budged in 10 years even to keep up with inflation while cost of living continues to rise. [The bottom 80% of the country combined which includes most of the working middle class only has 7% of the country‚Äôs wealth (and this has only worsened since the time of this citation)](https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM). For the average working person, Europe and Canada (even Australia) are going to be better places to live on average. 

For the rich, yes, nothing beats the USA that I‚Äôm aware of, but the vast majority of people aren‚Äôt in that boat. We don‚Äôt even have healthcare which is nuts. Andrew Yang was right and the only candidate to give me real hope in years. But obviously all of the owners who benefit from the current system don‚Äôt want change since it would make their lives slightly more inconvenient. It‚Äôs an irrational use of resources that we allow people like Bezos for example to exist while so much suffering that is not our fault is present. Suppose a CEO makes 60 million in a year ‚Äî his life and the lives of his kids and their kids are set just from that ‚Äî we do not live in a meritocracy, at least not anymore.

As a tangent from that, the truth is not everyone has a net positive life ‚Äî if you‚Äôre poor and you have kids you‚Äôre most likely damning them to a very difficult life of wage slavery, debt, and poverty. For their sake, don‚Äôt do it. For example, if I‚Äôm poverty stricken in India, why the fuck would I have kids? Think about the suffering they‚Äôre likely to endure and how hard their lives will be? Why put that burden on them? I would never have kids unless I could help them and provide for them ‚Äî in the US that means helping them get through the financial void that is university at the very least.

We can examine it in hindsight, and it isn't just that there is incremental progress that is hard to spot.  No, the protests were *entirely* unable to make lasting changes.  As far as I can tell, the movement was not able to get even a single piece of legislation passed. 

While modern media allows people to quickly join movements and get connected to recent events, the quickly spreading nature of memetic material is not a benefit for protests.  It means that protests grow faster than they can be organized and whipped into shape, leading to little direction possible beyond than 'march that way'.   

This is doubly so because grassroots movements grow from many places at once which predisposes them to decentralization. It is no coincidence that the most renowned protest movements have had clear leaders, and it is much harder for such a structure to exist in the age of social medial. 

And I wouldn't even say this is a Western phenomenon.  The Arab Spring was similarly decentralized protest with vague motives, and likewise had little results before resorting to mob violence.  And unlike vague postering en masse, mob violence is unfortunately very effective at achieving its simple goals. 

There are also other worldwide protests to look at, all of which failed.  The Iranian Green Movement.  Failed to achieve reform.  The Spanish Indignados movement, etc.

If you can't be more specific that's impossible to address. We are responsible for Syria. Their ""civil war"" wasn't, it was a terrorist uprising and the government of Syria put it down in under 3 months...then the US got involved and began funding, arming, and training those fighting the Syrian government despite knowing that it was mostly terrorist groups. The war stretched on for years, destroying much of the infrastructure and turning previously peaceful cities into war zones. Before that, Syria was roughly 10% christian, last I checked it was under 1%. Muslims showed up and told them to convert or die. The US is 100% responsible for all of it. 

But what about the first 3 months before we became overtly involved? Where did the fighters come from? Iraq. That we overthrew, for no good reason. Estimates of the death toll reach as high as 1 million as a direct result of our invasion, but after reading the studies I agree with the ones estimating 500k more. What kept all the warlike muslims in check in Iraq? A strongman dictator. We installed him years before, then we removed him. Even the UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, said it was in violation of international law.

Oh, and Libya? Ghaddafi is gone now. Under him he turned Libya into one of the best countries in Africa by most metrics. Access to clean water, education, and so on. Not that he was an angel, but they were stable. Now it's a terrorist shithole, divided up by warlords and constant fighting. You can even find slave markets there, as it's making a comeback. It wasn't like that before. The terrorists who tried to fight Ghaddafi and oust him had no chance without our air support and bombings helping them.

Those three countries are absolutely our fault. Those are the pipeline into europe. If any of those 3 remained intact, some to most of the ""refugees"" wouldn't be in Europe right now.

&gt; Would you support getting involved in other countries to help end war crimes, pogroms and other heinous events? 

Didn't you notice? Our involvement WAS THE WAR CRIMES. If you feel morally obligated to stop events like mass murder, then you should be opposed to the US foreign policy that is killing so many people. If you object to things like the beheadings in France and no go zones in Sweden, consider who set the board for those directly responsible to end up in  Europe in the first place.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604213828,,False,0,{},garrdjg,False,t3_jldfe1,False,True,t1_gap28ar,/r/Libertarian/comments/jldfe1/what_are_your_most_important_issues_right_now/garrdjg/,False,,1615925294,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],

Long story short, their customer service is a joke.

Got my 2018 XPS with 1 year warranty from Dell, plus another years warranty from the British store I bought it from ‚Äî fabulous. I even negated Dells student discount and bought the item full price just to get that extra year, thought that was well worth it. 

My first mistake was 2 months in, dead pixels occurred in the bottom right corner. It wasn‚Äôt enough of a problem for me to send it back and wait **three weeks** while it gets shipped from **Scotland** **to the Netherlands** for repair, as I had important work to do. 

At the 12 month mark, just under my Dell warranty, it all went tits up. Could smell smoke, USBs stopped working. I nuked the devices and got in contact with Dell. 

This was 2 weeks under the first year‚Äôa warranty. 

It gets to Dell, and I am billed ¬£390 for water damage, which includes replacements of the touchscreen(?), motherboard, keyboard, and hard drive. 

So firstly, water damage was a fabrication. Apparently their litmus paper detected it, but nothing had been spilt on this machine. I did some Googling and apparently a change in climate can do this, and this laptop had been from the Tropics to the Arctic within that year (don‚Äôt ask), so maybe that caused it. 

I went full Karen and challenged this. I agreed that maybe the motherboard had fried, hence the smell of smoke, but just couldn‚Äôt work out all of these tertiary problems ‚Äî like the screen(?!). 

‚ÄòThe screen?‚Äô I thought, but then I remembered the dead pixels from before. 

Well, 2 weeks of emails back and forward with somebody higher up; some div lower down **sent back my laptop unchanged**.

I found the Dell number and was furious. They arranged a courier to pick it up **again** in the meantime.

But when I opened the package, it wasn‚Äôt the dead pixels they billed me for, the screen actually had a spider-web crack on it like some Kyle thought it was a toilet wall. I thought, great! I have photos the day I shipped it so Dell or UPS have dropped my device. 

I send it back off and 2 days later, I get another Dell email billing me for **¬£560**.

They decided to add an aluminium casing to the list of repairs. What an actual joke service centre.

They also said my device was now out of warranty. Ergh. 

So I called up the store I bought it from and they just said ‚Äòif they say it‚Äôs water damage, then it‚Äôs water damage. Your warranty is void.‚Äô

I swear I was about to refer myself to my GP at this point. This is 1 month into my original claim at this point by the way. 

After going higher up at the British store, it got to the point where they believed me and my problem, having had photo evidence from the first referral etc. 

The chap took on the challenge, and delegated the task of chatting to Dell to himself. Thank god I thought.

Well that lasted... 1 day. Dell called me direct and complained that every time that they called this British store they had to wait 40 minutes on the line. What a stupid, utterly **stupid** thing to say when I had spend upwards of 24 hours waiting on the shitting lines of both of these companies.

Dell gave me an ultimatum, pay up or we‚Äôll send it back. I said something like ‚Äòlook, no. This device has a problem that has gone up way higher than the others at the service centre. Can you just keep it for now and wait until one of your line managers has taken some time to look at it?‚Äô. 

He reluctantly agreed. But why did I even need to tell him this? Surely alongside a serial number there is a list of past services tickets ‚Äî some still open during that time. 

A week later, I called my contact at the British store, who had actually given me his personal number to avoid the phone queue. We‚Äôd actually become quite good friends I though; he too thought Dell were a bunch of imbeciles. 

While the store was still reluctant to pay of the  entirety of the ¬£560 sum, they offered my to pay half of the original bill (¬£195), because the second bill was so painfully an attempt at getting more money. 

Why send two differently priced bills for the same problem? Who runs the European service centre?

""IMPENETRABLE RUSSIAN TANK ARMOUR STANDS UP TO EXAMINATION

By Richard M. Ogorkiewicz

Claims by NATO testers in the 1990s that the armour of Soviet Cold War tanks was ‚Äúeffectively impenetrable‚Äù have been supported by comments made following similar tests in the US.

Speaking at a conference on ‚ÄúThe Future of Armoured Warfare‚Äù in London on the 30th May, IDR's Pentagon correspondent Leland Ness explained that US Army tests involving firing trials on 25 T-72A1 and 12 T-72B1 tanks (each fitted with Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour [ERA]) had confirmed NATO tests done on other former Soviet tanks left behind in Germany after the end of the Cold War. The tests showed that the ERA and composite Armour of the T-72s was incredibly resilient to 1980s NATO anti-tank weapons.

In contrast to the original, or 'light', type of ERA which is effective only against shaped charge jets, the 'heavy' Kontakt-5 ERA is also effective against the long-rod penetrators of APFSDS tank gun projectiles, anti-tank missiles, and anti-armour rotary cannons. Explosive reactive armour was valued by the Soviet Union and its now-independent component states since the 1970s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the T-55 and T-62 tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units.

""During the tests we used only the weapons which existed with NATO armies during the last decade of the Cold War to determine how effective such weapons would have been against these examples of modern Soviet tank design. Our results were completely unexpected. When fitted to the T-72A1 and B1 the 'heavy' ERA made them immune to the DU (Depleted Uranium) penetrators of the M829A2 APFSDS (used by the 120 mm guns of the Cold War era US M1 Abrams tanks), which are among the most formidable of current tank gun projectiles. We also tested the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger (the gun of the A-10 Thunderbolt II Strike Plane), the 30mm M320 (the gun of the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter) and a range of standard NATO Anti Tank Guided Missiles ‚Äì all with the same result of no penetration or effective destruction of the test vehicles. The combined protection of the standard armour and the ERA gives the Tanks a level of protection equal to our own. The myth of Soviet inferiority in this sector of arms production that has been perpetuated by the failure of downgraded T-72 export tanks in the Gulf Wars has, finally, been laid to rest. The results of these tests show that if a NATO/Warsaw Pact confrontation had erupted in Europe, the Soviets would have had parity (or perhaps even superiority) in armour‚Äù ‚Äì U.S. Army Spokesperson at the show.

Newer KE penetrators have been designed since the Cold War to defeat the Kontakt-5 (although Kontakt-5 has been improved as well). As a response the Russian Army has produced a new type of ERA, ‚ÄúRelikt‚Äù, which is claimed to be two to three times as effective as Kontakt-5 and completely impenetrable against modern Western warheads.

Despite the collapse of the USSR, the Russian Tank industry has managed to maintain itself and its expertise in armour production, resulting in modern designs (such as the T-90, the T-95 and mysterious Black Eagle) to replace the, surprisingly, still effective Soviet era tanks. These tests will do much to discount the argument of the ‚ÄúLion of Babylon‚Äù (the ineffective Iraqi version of the T-72M) and export quality tanks being compared to the more sophisticated and upgraded versions which existed in the Soviet military‚Äôs best Tank formations and continue to be developed in a resurgent Russian military industrial complex.""",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,,0,1604219149,,False,0,{},garvyu8,False,t3_jlyt0g,False,True,t1_garvrnv,/r/Warthunder/comments/jlyt0g/m829a1_silver_bullet/garvyu8/,False,,1615927479,-6,True,False,Warthunder,t5_2uc6j,r/Warthunder,public,,0,[],

We had a few evenings talking in our ""Mannschaftsheim"" (a bar/restaurant open to all ranks within the barracks). We talked about a lot of stuff, military, family, even history, war etc. 
Fascinating man, fascinating (yet sobering and sad) experience. I found out that his family was to be imprisoned by the Nazis and fled to england, later to israel from there on. They used to live in the same area my family comes from (northern Harz region). I was so blown away when i mentioned a few cities and villages and he actually heard of them! Turns out that in a different chain of events we might have been friends (same age, same area, pretty rural - usually you know most people around) or workmates. He told me that his grand parents still ""never arrived in israel with their hearts"", they still mourned their old home - despite the obvious terrible fate that they would have suffered, had they stayed.

My Question: Is this something that older israelis still see in a similar way? Do you (younger generation israelis) still have to cope with the personal traumas (sorry, i don't know enough english to word this any better) of your parents/ grand parents / great grand parents? What's your ""mindset"" when you hear about those ""old places""?

Remember this is *independent* of endangered species ranking.  Some snails are more rare than humpback whales, so ignore conservation status here.   Some vegans and animal rights people like to make a big deal out of sentience, animal that perceive their environment at high levels.  But other vegans oppose [Speciesism](https://www.peta.org/features/what-is-speciesism/) and regard all creatures of equal value. From PETA: 

&gt;Speciesism is a misguided belief that one species is more important than another. This toxic mindset is deeply ingrained in our society, and it results in all kinds of negative consequences. 

The breakdown:

&gt;*1) Top of the list:*   Our beloved pets: dog, cats.  Also whales, elephants, and great apes, said to have higher intelligence (sentience).  These are seen as particularly special animals.

&gt;*2) Second Level:*  Special animals that do not make level 1, though many people believe they should be on level 1).  Horses, eaten in Europe like beef, are a good example.   Many Americans want protection for the West's feral horses. Some people want pigs to be here.  Both are more intelligent than most mammals.

&gt;*3) Third.*  Run-of-the-mill mammals:  deer, raccoons, badgers, kangaroos, wolves, bears, sloths, beavers, bison, skunks, birds, etc. *Also mammals we customarily eat: cow, chickens, pigs, sheep, ducks, etc.*  Many, many dozens of animals under this Category.

I'm sure some Zionists were deliberately ignorant of the needs of locals, out of racism. Racism was wide-spread back then: in the UK, in the US, in Palestinian Arabs and in Jewish Palestinians too. It wouldn't be particularly productive to look back and say ""See, Zionists *were* racists"", when in fact almost everyone in the World was racist back then. 

If you are against British Colonization, then in a sense it also makes sense to be against Zionism: I don't believe Zionism was a colonialist movement itself, but I do believe it piggy-backed on colonialism to succeed.  
That said, incidents of Jews fighting *against* the British Mandate are also well recorded, and the White Paper was a magnificent display of anti-Semitism on behalf of the Brits, in spite of European Jews being in dire need of help during these years in particular.

It's more realistic to look at the Jewish immigrants in the region VS. the Arab population, and their behaviour over the last 100 years. 

Why? Because I don't really subscribe to any religious or racial logic of ""This land is mine and only mine because a book or because my ancient grandfather said so"". The history of humanity has been defined by consistent immigration and emigration, everywhere, and the story of the Israelis and the Palestinians isn't that unique if you look at it at a wider historical scale (although it *is* one of the most interesting cases).  


Although terrorism was initially caused by both sides, against each other and against the British Mandate, there are overwhelming examples of Arabs working with Jews, Jews learning Arabic and Arabs learning Hebrew. Both sides are to blame for the steady escalation of violence.  
What I do blame uniquely on the Palestinian Leadership is their all-or-nothing mentality, that led them to reject every. single. peace deal throughout history, at the expense of their own people. This is where Palestine has failed.

That's why the attitude of the people  of the USA doesn't change suddenly over night when a new government is  in place, or when there is a new election. Like this Tuesday. It changes gradually, year by  year, percent by percent. And those changes rarely end up in headlines,  for all to read about. They happen in the background, quietly. 

&gt;Yes, there's obviously plenty of homophobia in the usa, but it's a very big &amp; diverse nation.  

Indeed, but that doesn't change that the average is quite different from many countries in Western Europe. Because of its size, the USA is quite unique in its huge and stable geographical pockets of homophobia, and huge and stable geographical pockets of tolerance, as many people in this sub have testified about.

&gt;Remember that in a huge part of the european union, gay marriage has no prospects of ever happening. 

Gay marriage or domestic partnership (which is really the same thing) is already in place in almost all EU countries. I can think of six countries out of 28 (27) where this isn't in place, all of them new member states. So what ""huge part""? 

And are you seriously imagining that things won't change, just like they have the last thirty years? Imagine if someone said in 1990 that ""gay marriage has no prospects of ever happening"", because almost no country in the world had it? Every single country in the EU, and the West, have seen huge improvements in public attitudes towards gay people. Poland has seen the biggest improvement in the EU these last ten years, for example, despite, or even because of, the current government. Do you seriously believe this development will somehow magically stop completely for ten years, twenty year, thirty year...? No, my friend, every country in the world will legalise same-sex marriage, it's only a question of time, albeit several decades in some cases. 

In the six EU states I mentioned resistance to gay marriage might have been close to 100 percent not long ago. Now it's down to 70-60 percent or so. In ten years it'll probably be closer to 40-50, if not better, and they will be close to actually enacting gay marriage. It's not rocket science, it's happened lots of time before.

As such, 8 September 1917, the Bolsheviks occupy Petrograd, with the support of other soldiers. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks start to occupy other parts of Russia. The country has entered a civil war. Meanwhile, some parts of Russia become to declare indepedence, includinf Finland, Ukraine, and some little countries in Caucausus. The Bolsheviks began to occupy large parts of Russia(most of the European Russia, parts of Turkestan and Siberia)

Meanwhile, they sign an peace with the Central Powers on 17 November 1917, and a peace treaty on 21 January 1918, ceding large territories to Central Powers. At the same time, Finland enters a civil war.

Trust me non of them must have occurred at all because in the end we are same humans it is ""us"" who are suffering. Another point that I'd like to raise if you open the list of the attacks by those muslims (for sure they aren't) check where they've occurred. Answer: in Muslim countries themselves in my country Pakistan ( which is a Muslim country). 80% of global terrorist attack victims are Muslims. Now u tell me if it's Muslims or Islam who are actually doing these attacks then why the fuck they're bombing themselves most? Why they are causing most casualties in Muslim countries why not in the Europe? Because those dumb people are NOT Muslims at all neither they've anything to with Islam. They've been inflicted upon Muslims and it is us Muslims and Islam who are actually being oppressed: by West on one side and those Terrorists on the other. It's completely insane to say that Muslims are  supporting these attacks at all for what on earth they would? U just need to think about everything with an open mind. 
Besides that even if you wanna compare ( which is pointless because again HUMANS are being attacked ) 30 years in days become 10,950 days so now you can see 300 hundred attacks in 10,950 days is like one attack after months but when u look at 182,000 attacks in 10,950 u need to think about it because there's been more than a lot which your eyes have missed or should I say the entire Media forgot to report. U gotta think that the deaths of countless western human were actually  kept away from you because the attacks were actually done by westerns. You've been reported in very particular way to make u end up with one conclusion that Islam is not a religion of peace. No country, not even mine one, will ever report where it has been wrong.  Why it is that if a white attacks people the event is considered awful and sad and black day for humanity but if it is caused by a Muslim( even if it occurred in a Muslim country) it is said that ""Islam is not a religion of peace""?
In the end I'm sharing a  link and I would highly recommend you to watch the video, in this Mahdi Hassan is talking about a research by an american university on terrorism caused by so called Muslims and Western people:

In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ‚ÄòGod save the King‚Äô than of stealing from a poor box. All through the critical years many left-wingers were chipping away at English morale, trying to spread an outlook that was sometimes squashily pacifist, sometimes violently pro-Russian, but always anti-British.

Ikke fordi jeg ikke mener at diskussionen  kan v√¶re vigtig, men fordi du gang p√• gang skyder mig noget i skoene som jeg hverken mener eller har sagt eller antydet. Det er vildt belastende.

&gt;	For det f√∏rste mener jeg ikke at danske b√∏ger, eller danske film eller danske br√¶tspil eller hvad ved jeg, er s√• ligegyldigt som du pr√∏ver at g√∏re det til. 

Jeg har ikke p√• noget som helst tidspunkt hverken sagt eller antydet at danske b√∏ger, film eller br√¶tspil er ligegyldigt. Det er fuldkommen grebet ud af luften.

Jeg har blot bedt dig om eksempler p√• hvad det er for danske produkter du mener man ikke s√¶lger hos Amazon, og som du tror vil blive solgt hos Amazon hvis og n√•r de ""kommer til Danmark"".
Du bliver ved med at sk√∏jte rundt om det ret simple sp√∏rgsm√•l, og det g√∏r det frustrerende at tale med dig.

Nu kan jeg s√• se at produkterne er ""danske b√∏ger, danske film, danske br√¶tspil og hvad ved jeg"".  S√• er vi da kommet lidt l√¶ngere end f√∏r, og jeg giver dig da ret i at det kan t√¶nkes at Amazon vil begynde at s√¶lge den slags p√• et tidspunkt.  Jeg ved s√• stadig ikke hvad du mener med ""hvad ved jeg"", men jeg antager at det er fordi du reelt ikke kan komme p√• andre s√¶rligt danske produkter.

&gt;	Kommer an p√• hvad du mener med hvorn√•r nogen er p√• det danske marked. 

Amazon har et dansk dom√¶nenavn som i tidernes morgen omstillede til deres UK-baserede butik, og i de senere √•r omstiller til deres tyske butik.
De har udvidet gratis levering til at g√¶lde leverancer til Danmark.

Tager man det i mente skal man virkelig g√∏re en indsats for at p√•st√• at Amazon ikke er p√• det danske marked. Man skal faktisk tale direkte imod bedre vidende.

&gt;	Som sagt er alle verdens webbutikker jo i princippet p√• det danske marked

Nej, det er noget √¶vl og det ved du godt. Butikker der sender deres varer fra ikke-EU lande er ikke p√• det danske marked. De h√∏rer ikke under dansk lovgivning.

&gt;	Hvorvidt de ‚Äúer i Danmark‚Äù virker p√• mig som en ligegyldig teoretisk diskussion du kan have med journalister.

Det er fandeme s√¶rt at du har brugt flere dage p√• at diskutere det med mig s√•. Det er sjovt nok det hele denne snak er g√•et ud p√•.

&gt;	Der findes da butikker der giver gratis levering

Ja. Amazon. Er der andre butikker som leverer gratis hvis du k√∏ber for ‚Ç¨30? Jeg spurgte dig f√∏r, men du har ikke rigtig kunnet komme med et eksempel.


&gt;	Apple er jo for det f√∏rste et hardware brand og ikke en webshop. 

Apple s√¶lger hardware fra egen produktion og fra andres produktion, og s√¶lger derudover en r√¶kke services. Det er faktisk ikke en helt dum sammenligning.

&gt;	Men selv Apple har mig bekendt ogs√• en dansk webshop p√• dansk sprog osv. 

Korrekt. De har en dansksproget side. Jeg forst√•r ikke helt hvad du mener med ""osv.""? Kan du uddybe?


&gt;	Kan godt v√¶re du mener den slags er ligegyldigt, men der er mange i dag der ikke vil handle p√• en amazon.de men godt p√• en amazon.dk p√• dansk.

Hvorfor tror du det?

I hope people remember the political climate, and discussion in the UK, pre 2016.

In   2015 Labour campaigned on a platform of cuts to our public services.   They tried to out-do the Tories in both austerity measures and   anti-immigration rhetoric.

If   Corbyn had never become Labour leader, we'd never have mainstreamed the   question: Why do the working people of Britain have to pay for the   crimes of bankers via cuts to the public services they rely on? Why has   public money been used to secure bankers bonuses when they partook in a   criminal act of malpractice in their debt leveraging and credit  default  swap gambling?

There  would never  have been a mainstream discussion about how a strong  welfare state is  needed to drive up wages, and we'd never have seen a  nuanced discussion  about immigration and how it's used as a scapegoat.  We'd never have seen  a positive force in the mainstream of British  discourse pushing for  house-building, strong wages, public services and  a transformative,  state-led Green New Deal.

We'd   never have had the conversations about how a profit motive will never   ever be sufficient to tackle the climate emergency and how the market   cannot and will not fix it.

Labour   were truly pathetic weathervanes before Corbyn's leadership: too meek   to challenge the Tory hegemony over this country and too comfortable to   invest in understanding policy that works across Europe.

The   problem with taking the easy road is that it cements these archaic and   regressive ideas in the minds of the public. It makes them believe the   only way forward is via the hegemony created by the astronomically   wealthy few who own the media and direct British discourse. When it   comes to actually implementing something progressive, the public are too   subdued and too scared; they no longer believe something better is   possible because nothing is ever really on offer.

Seraphine's case is REALLY sophisticated to explain on the perspective of Koreans. You need to understand the political&amp;historical&amp;cultural backgrounds and relationships of Korea, China and Japan.

Well, I agree with some comments concerning racism. Some reacts are impolite and imply hatred to a certain nationality. However, most of Koreans do not ignore and undermine China and its culture itself as the way they want to be treated.

Korea, China and Japan are neighbors to each other, and also kind of rivals. If someone says those 3 coutries are same or similar, all these ppl from those three will literally mad. Even the details of chopsticks are different. They are influenced by the others, but they also keep their own tradition. Naturally, they compare to the others and assert that 'I am the best among them.' (I think you can find other examples in Europe, America and anywhere in the world.)

It could be just an undesirable competition, but sometimes one of the three lies that it has originalities on tradition songs, dances, pictures and etc from the others.(Even history) These awkward situations make the case worse.

Since 2000, China has grown mega in the aspect of both economic and culture. China's voice in the world also gets more focus. Both Korea and Japan feel that sometimes China steals cultural and historical advantages. 

Recently, Genshin is considered as a 'perfectly copy and paste' of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild by many Asians. As the same way, Koreans think that China takes K-pop throughly from Korea and makes theirs. 

KDA was introduced as a K-Pop group. However, this new KDA's song does not seem like a K-pop to Koreans. It is more like... Riot makes some kind of C-pop to Kr ppl. I think it is because of the language differnces. Chinese and Korean are way different, actually both cannot interact with each other. Grammar, vocabs, and everything. Yeah, it is similat to English but K-pop was born under the influece of English songs. Um, maybe some of you say this is just a brand new style, but even the music video's style is Chinese one.(Colors, style, code... very subtle but Kr ppl can 'understand')

Moreover, most Koreans thought that KDA is a special gift for Korean LOL players from Riot. Like Star Guardians to Japanese players(based on Japanese Mahou girls animations), and new year's skins to Chinese players(based on Chinese tradtional dresses). Even I feel like... my surprised gift goes to other person as a birthday present.

I would not feel disappointed if Riot makes a new singer's group with a Chinese style. I don't know why they pushed Seraphine into KDA. Maybe next then those two groups make a collab, that would be great...

I disagree. Those with Chinese doctor/nurse friends, such as myself, knew very early (because these people, especially nurses, love to gossip/discuss interesting cases in group chats, and they build a very close relationship with their fellow students, including juniors and seniors, which means a nurse will often have friends working at 20+ different hospitals). I was aware of the situation looking really dire back in mid-late December. So were Taiwan, and I suspect many other countries. But the CCP kept downplaying the situation and forced WHO to do the same, so I can understand why people who have no interest in China didn't know.  
  
&gt; Literally no country was going to just close all flights simply due to the discovery of a novel coronavirus. At the start it was still being researched and studied, and nobody even knew if it was human to human, airborne, or anything like that.  
  
The Chinese government and medical workers knew, as they could surge in patients suffering from similar symptoms, as well as their colleagues getting infected. But they were censored by the government before they could warm the population to take caution. When China forced WHO to say there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission then you already had many detected cases, including a Chinese in Thailand - it was such a disastrous statement for WHO to make. There were also many leaked videos of people collapsing on the streets in Wuhan.. I remember seeing videos of at least 10 different incidents.  
  
&gt; Yeah, in hindsight we could have closed all flights in January, but even that wouldn't have been enough given it has seen been detected as early as October in Europe  
  
It would've been enough if China decided to shut down their borders until the situation got under control, but they of course had no interest in doing that (and decided to do the opposite, and even allow people from Wuhan to leave the country). And to make matters worse then they had its companies and citizens buy up all medical equipment all over the world and ship it back to China, and subsequently ban exports of medical equipment.

However, some people exclusively vote becauss they either had their rural roads paved (barely), or they got a job because of them.

So, how does getting a job in the public sector look like?

Well, my friend, you either spend years in college to be extremely qualified only to go abroad for work that pays a decent wage, or you cant find one with your high school (if you even have an education or skill), so you resort to becoming a member of the SNS pyramid scheme in which you do work for a while until they say you finally deserved your below average wage job.

Oh, and the dead can also vote, some parts of the country even had ABOVE 100% turnout rate. AV is like what you might hear about Lukashenko, except he is mild enough in his oppression to not alarm the EU.

There was also ~11%(at a below 50% turnout) support for the socialists, which are the ghouls from the Milosevic era, supporters are either braindead, actually dead, yugonostalgic, communist, or all of the above.


The third party of the govt. coalition is some sort of ""patriotic alliance"" lead by a former vaterpolo player which ironically is more progressive in it's plans than the conservative ""progressive party"". However, all three parties share their values of crony capitalism, nepotism, and liberty measured by your bank account.
This political party barely made the cut with ~3.3%.
Why does this matter? Earlier this year, around January, they reduced the necessary 5% of votes to be able to enter the parliament to a miserable 3%.

The party that almost made the cut with 2.9% were the monarchists, which are satelites, much like every other party. There was one anti-govt/true opposition option and it was a bloke who resolved to conspiracy theories because he was losing support, but they actually participated only so they can report irregularities at the polling places, which is cool of them.

There was another choice of ""opposition"" which was supposed to boycott the elections like the rest of them, the leader is an actor, and he claimed he would boycott, then claimed he was offered half a milion euros by SNS to participate at the elections and declined it, then he participated anyways, meaning he probably accepted a much higher bribe and would not be a true opposition anyways, so people agaist the government literally didnt have an option to vote for.

The neurosis of the virus - or the neurosis virus

J. R. GUZZO OCTOBER 23, 2020

Eight consecutive months of covid are increasingly making it clear that one of the worst side effects of the epidemic was a massive assault on the mental health of people who never had a single real symptom of the infection, nor did they need any kind of medical care because of it. This pathology, barely noticed at the beginning of the wave, and progressively installed in the victims' daily behavior, manifests itself through a basic anomaly: the passive, and then very active, acceptance of irrational convictions in their brain, emotional and psychological system. It is as if the general key that ensures normal functioning - or what was considered normal until some time ago - had been disconnected, somewhere, from the circuits in which human thought moves.

Does it make any sense for the citizen to enter a restaurant, sit at the table and just take off their mask when eating - or, even worse, to put on and take off with each mouthful? Of course not, but anyone who behaves this way is convinced that he is right and the rest are risking their own lives - and his life, in the most radical instances of anti-virus activism. It is not normal, in the same way, that many people consider it essential, in addition to the imported ""bike"", helmet and uniform, to wear a mask to ride a bicycle outdoors. They do as they did in the year 1300, or so, when the barons, doctors and priests convinced people that the black plague came through the air. (His capital advice, 700 years ago: ‚ÄúStay at home‚Äù.) Mothers have been seen to put mini-masks on their babies when they go for a stroll; it is obvious that the only disease present in the case is in their head.

In France, the cradle of Western-Christian-progressive civilization, beacon of wisdom, intelligence, logic and humanism, the authorities have just taken a truly extraordinary step: the country's almost 70 million inhabitants are prohibited from leaving their homes among at 9 pm and 6 am. No restaurant, bar, cafe, concert, theater, club; only the next day. We are like this, then: according to the French government, the virus only catches at night; during the day the citizen can move around at will, as the animal leaves and only returns when it gets dark. Naturally, they say that their action will reduce ‚Äúthe crowding‚Äù of people (being close to their peers, in these days of mental disturbance, is almost a crime against the homeland), but in reality it is nothing like that. Why would ‚Äúcrowding‚Äù at night be worse than ‚Äúcrowding‚Äù at noon? It is pure herd panic on the part of government officials who still have no idea what to do and use, to give their orders, the religious acceptance of ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù.

This is the reality; the same France that gave us Descartes, Voltaire and Balzac today gives us Emmanuel Macron. Do what? C‚Äôest la vie, the French themselves would say - that's all we have to offer at the moment. The problem with the French president, and the agents of his government, is not exactly having wrong ideas. The problem is that they are not able to have any idea - not an original idea, or even simply usable, or for some useful purpose. They just repeat dead ideas; there is no risk of creating anything. It is not just Macron, obviously, or just France. It represents only the average quality of governments that prevails today in the countries of advanced Europe. Even more: Macron is one of the mega-victims, also he and many good people, of the progressive psychological collapse that the epidemic brought to everyone.

In Brazil, possibly because there are at least some 150 million people here who are too poor to have this type of neurasthenia, something that is private to the middle classes upwards, the virus's footprint is more harmless. It is much more in the media, in the high castes of the civil service and in the media where, in general, people don't really have to work to earn a living than in the majority of the population. What involves Brazil in the great mental anomaly brought by the covid is, on the one hand, the medical or scientific superstition that has become curiously common today. This type of superstition is very popular here and around the world. Basically, doctors know about covid not much more than they did in February; as they do not know, they invented the ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù. Most men of science, of course, know perfectly well that the aberrant behaviors described above are very close to insanity. But they don't want to talk about it; they are afraid of being accused of genocide, or something, if they open their mouths to say that two plus two is four. If not even the President of the Republic escaped the accusation of killing 160,000 people, including by the Supreme Federal Court, why would a simple doctor who has to earn his living go against the psychoses that command current thinking?

This on the one hand - on the other hand, and even worse, there is the voluntary behavior of people. A very large number of people decided to take the Gospel of ‚Äúsocial detachment‚Äù to extremes; they want to live in isolation, in the belief that they can postpone the hour of death if they stay ‚Äúat home‚Äù, as mandated by YouTube ‚Äúopinion makers‚Äù and charlatans (light model, but charlatans anyway) of the new scientific belief. They were convinced, by some kind of imbalance in the apparatus where their reasoning is formed, that being free from covid they are also mysteriously free from liver cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction. In this great neurosis, they broke away from the outside world as much as possible and reduced their physical contact with other human beings to a minimum. They have moved away from neighbors, friends and even their own family members - they consider that the worst thing that can happen to them is seeing someone else. They started out of fear, only; then they started to like it and today they think it is better to live like this.

There are a lot of people thinking about a ‚Äúlife change‚Äù: the current life comes out, full of selfishness, inequality, etc. etc. and enters the life of the new millennium, increasingly virtual and increasingly virtuous, where digital communication via WhatsApp, Zoom and other tricks is becoming the ideal way - or worse, the only way - to keep in touch with other beings of flesh, bone, soul and heart. They want to live like this for as long as possible and, in the most extreme cases, forever. There it is not the fault of the precarious governor Wilson Witzel, national champion of pro-confinement dementia and now removed from office, according to official complaints, for being a thief - a thief of money destined to fight the epidemic, by the way. It is the fault of whoever is choosing to live like this. The problem, in these cases, is not with the covid, neither with governments nor with President Macron; is in their heads. The real disease will not be found in the infection of the lungs, but in the brain equipment of each one.

During the¬†unification of Germany¬†in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed by¬†German nationalists¬†as a symbol of German unity and freedom.[9]¬†Following¬†World War II, however, Arminius was¬†omitted¬†from German textbooks due to his association with militaristic nationalism, and many modern Germans are unaware of his story; the 2,000th anniversary of his victory at the Teutoburg Forest was only lightly commemorated in Germany.[9]

That is a quote taken from wikipedia, the article on Arminius.


And what is posted below is a quote from a der spiegel article on the issue:

But Germany is marking the event with noticeable restraint. There's no sense of glory and no program of flag-waving festivals of the sort one would expect in other nations celebrating their creation

In fact, a lot of Germans don't even know about Arminius. Many schools shunned his story after 1945 because he became contaminated by the militant nationalism that led to Hitler.

The book is written in a lighter way and touches on lots of different topics that should be familiar to people. Albert Einstein, the end of the First World War, Hitler's impact (or lack of impact) during the Weimar Republic, Inflation, the Great Depression. It also has a lot of things that most people haven't heard of and goes into detail about a wide variety of aspects of life.

Shirer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich) is one of the most well respected and thorough narratives of the origins, actions and impacts of the Nazi Party. The book itself is over 1,200 pages and is some times split into three parts, focusing on the Rise, the Reign and the Fall of the Third Reich. Shirer starts as early as the unification of modern Germany and describing the impacts of the First World War on the complex populations and politics of central Europe.

Fucked in what sense? I was simply pointing out the Taiwan is staring down the barrel of a much bigger gun. Covid is awful, but it will end, eventually. Your problem isn't going away any time soon. 

&gt; China aside, this statement is full of shit.

It's really not. Every single East Asian government (even the 'democracies') is decidedly more authoritarian than any of the major Western liberal democracies. It's not a controversial fact. Throw that in with the fact that East Asians tend to be more pliant and subservient than Europeans, and that's why you get the comparative difference with respect to handling the current pandemic (never mind the fact that you all had the correct behavior beaten into you during SARS, whereas Europe did not).

I live in London, the vast, vast majority of people wear masks in enclosed spaces, shops, transport, etc... You are about 4 months too late with that point. The contact tracing successes of, say, Korea, rely on a) beginning from a low base, and b) invasions of privacy that would never be accepted in the West. It's true that Europe could have done a much better job in this regard than they did. But to pretend that we could have replicated what was happening half a world a way is ridiculous and belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the different societies and the social contracts we have with our respective governments.

Okay, so I now have one observation and one follow-up question:

**Observation**: I understand the European cultural aversion to paying for things with money you ""don't have"" via credit card. In the U.S. there is a fairly widely accepted idea that you should *always* use a credit card *if possible*, given that U.S. credit cards give you points, perks, etc. *on every/many daily purchases*. By contrast, using a debit card does nothing for you from the standpoint of credit-building, and bonus perks.

Obviously, (and unfortunately) there is a not-insignificant segment of the U.S. population that ends up getting itself into trouble when more in expenses are charged to a credit card than can actually be paid off from a debit/savings/checking account every month. This results in having to pay significant interest on the remaining monthly credit card balance, etc. *However*, assuming you are charging to your credit card responsibly, and paying it off in full every month, you can accrue a boatload of bonus points for things you were going to pay for anyway with your debit card. So credit cards &gt; debit cards.

**Follow-up Question**: Now that I understand the European situation better, what would you all recommend as the best/most intelligent way to earn some amount of points/cash-back/perks on every-day purchases here in the EU? Are there lots of bank-specific European debit cards that give some level of perks? Are there some competitive European credit cards you could recommend to me despite the fact that they might offer fewer perks than US credit cards? Should I continue to use my fancy-shmancy US credit cards for their perks, and then just go through the slight annoyance of exchanging currency ‚Ç¨---&gt;$ in order to pay them off every month?

Here is the study

A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers (2015)
http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751

Conclusions: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

Harvard Study published May 21, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine

""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In  many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.""

CDC study on the use of personal protective face masks against viral influenza transmission found no significant protection against or reduction of viral transmission of influenza among infected and uninfected individuals.

We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility

Masks are to protect other people from the wearer, not the other way around.

Virus particles are smaller than masks pores, meaning that they penetrate the mask and the virus is not airborne, so all measures are pointless and only a false sense of security...

But its cool to see how many people fell for that ‚Äúprotect the others‚Äù narrative... you can be told whatever by the so ‚Äúcalled‚Äù experts and would believe it.

Even more confounding, the study‚Äôs analysis indicates that crowded, dense locations are associated with lower coronavirus death rates.

The below information discusses cloth / face masks for generalized use in public as a proposed means of preventing viral infection.

Please don't conflate this with filtration masks like N95 respirators and higher intended for use by medical professional in hospital or similar environment.


Cloth/surgical face masks overview:

Cloth masks designed to protect wounds, blood splatter etc. Not designed as respiratory protectors - no viral filtration - for context one requires an electron microscope to view viruses. A cloth mask trying to filter viral particles is the equivalent of a soccer net trying to filter sand. No fit or seal on the face Prevents regular filtration through the nose due to imposed new breathing habits when wearing a mask. https://omft.info/en/news-posts/nasal-breathing-as-a-defense-against-the-corona-virus/


No regulation of quality of cloths Inconsistent guidelines for cloth/surgical mask wearers.

Nagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the Kura-Araxes culture, who lived between the two rivers Kura and Araxes.


Nagorno-KarabakhThe ancient population of the region consisted of various autochthonous local and migrant tribes who were mostly non-Indo-Europeans.[12] According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians who came to the region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd or, possibly earlier, in 4th century BC.[13] Other scholars suggest that the Armenians settled in the region as early as in the 7th century BC.[14]

In around 180 BC, Artsakh became one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom and remained so until the 4th century
In 1823 the five districts corresponding roughly to modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh was 90.8% Armenian.[53][54]

Was already in the process of writing this post but with the recent eU news, I decided to finish it now. I am probably going to echo a lot of what other pros and influencers have already said.

Viewership is down overall on all esports titles - this is not just a siege issue. The lack of global competition leads to repetitive games in regions and people get bored of seeing the same 4 teams play each other over and over. Its not all Ubisoft‚Äôs fault however, there are issues that can be solved. 

The scheduling of games. Moving the playdays around so EU doesn‚Äôt play straight into NA, avoiding NA‚Äôs later start time for Europe. Making the NA times earlier would make it more accessible to a larger audience as NA starts at 1/2am for anyone on this side of the world. 

Actual game issues. The boring meta and people not wanting to watch people clear utility for 2 mins every single round. It does get very boring and repetitive fast. I myself am finding it hard to continue to watch EUL. Ubisoft is still yet to publish anything about these issues or act on the issues that people are talking about. It‚Äôs taken 6 months for Ace/Melusi to finally get nerfed, but it‚Äôs not enough - IMO they‚Äôre still very strong. Shields are still on operators that are picked 100% of the time... Just simple changes like moving shields off Wamai and Smoke could make a world of difference, but still nothing.

The Regional Systems

With the switch from ESL to FACEIT, every region got its own system for how to rank each team in a region. LATAM has BO2, NA has BO3, and EU got BO1 with no OT. Viewership wise EU has the best system with each playday every team plays once. In my opinion, if EU added OT it would be the best system overall for viewership and the next best thing to BO3. The greatest issue with the NA system is that if one of the biggest teams in the region is not playing on a specific day, there are so many viewers not tuning in because DZ or TSM is not playing at all. I‚Äôm not against each region having a different format - other esports titles do the same, and it works very well as each region needs a system that works for the needs of the teams as it will not be the same globally.

The eUnited situation... They got very fucked with the current NA system. I am unable to give an exact date for when eU‚Äôs next game is but it is a really long time from now. That amount of time for a team to not compete in anything is not good at all. NA does not have any other regional tournaments to help develop/support a T3 scene like in EU that eU could potentially play in. The system mainly favours the top teams as they have constant games and can make the most money. For middle of the pack teams there‚Äôs very little money in Siege (this is for EU too). T2/T3 teams in the pilot program must wait until the start of next year for their skins to even be released. That is so much money to be missing out on in the meanwhile.

Orgs are not going to be wanting to pick up any bottom of the board teams with the threat of relegation still on the table. Tempo either just have or are reluctant to move their team to Vegas because they‚Äôre last in the league and could get relegated. It‚Äôs a lot of money for an org to invest and very little return or protection for NA teams unless you‚Äôve got big names in your team or a large brand and make content with or sell merch.

The R6 Esports team

~~The guy who ran the Ubisoft esports department (the same guy hyena called out on twitter) was fired and there was no one to replace him and keep his grand vision for what the r6 esports scene could be.~~ Because he was fired a lot of the esports team quit or moved on to other titles. Behind the scenes the department has been left extremely understaffed and they have to run the whole of r6 esports, one of them unfollowed every single R6 pro because he doesn‚Äôt like what the pros say( I can see why but surely not every pro complains 24/7 on twitter). Not sure how you expect to run an esports department and not follow a single professional in the scene.

R6 introduced the pilot program a year ago and the T1 teams just got their skins released. Like I said earlier T2/T3 teams have to wait until next year to get their skins in the game. This means so many teams could be making so much more money to help cover costs of salary. One of the requirements to be eligible is you have to be T1. With ubi adding more and more teams to the pilot program it‚Äôs going to be hard for orgs to keep their spot in T1 without franchising. This forces teams that drop to T2 to drop their teams and buyout the team that took their spot, so they keep the money from the pilot program. With the old vitality skins in the first edition of the pilot program when they dropped to CL the skins were removed from the store instantly.

I‚Äôve been told by pros that their orgs are talking, and the main topic is that they‚Äôre struggling to see the future in the game; the silence from Ubisoft isn‚Äôt helping at all. Even in the pro discord for reporting cheaters, the last time a dev confirmed that they‚Äôre looking into the reports was a month ago. eU was the first of many to leave the scene and I don‚Äôt blame them at all for doing so.

Omdat hij wegens de corona-maatregelen zijn familie in de Verenigde Staten niet kon bezoeken, bedacht Pete Hoekstra (67) deze zomer een alternatief. Hij stapte op de fiets en maakte een reis door de Nederlandse provincies.

Wat je dan zoal leert? ‚ÄûDat de betrekkingen tussen Nederlanders en Amerikanen bijzonder hecht zijn en hartelijk. De mensen die ik ontmoette begonnen niet over politiek, maar over de oorlog en de bevrijding, over hun reizen naar de VS, over hun contacten daar en hun zakelijke activiteiten. Allemaal heel positief. Wat mij zorgen baart is dat in de media een beeld is gecre√´erd alsof Amerika onder president Trump geen betrouwbare bondgenoot zou zijn. Daar is geen sprake van: wij zijn misschien wel betrouwbaarder dan ooit. Zo werken we met Nederland nauw samen op de gebieden van veiligheid en terreur, de veiligheidsdiensten wisselen informatie uit, we hebben hechte economische betrekkingen en we delen allerlei opvattingen over cultuur en identiteit. Onze relaties zijn heel hecht. Het zijn ook de VS die een sterkere NAVO willen. Wij willen bovendien een intensievere handelsrelatie met Europa en we willen samen optrekken met Europa tegen de uitdagingen die China opwerpt.‚Äù

**Het beeld van de Verenigde Staten onder Trump is in de Nederlandse media in het algemeen negatief. Hoe kijkt u daarnaar?**

‚ÄûMijn wortels liggen in Groningen, waar ik ben geboren, en wij komen al heel lang in Nederland. Ik heb persoonlijk diepe wortels in het conservatieve denken en al onder de presidenten Reagan en Bush begreep ik: Nederlanders houden niet van conservatieven. Reagan vonden ze een cowboy en een acteur, ze maakten hem belachelijk; Bush junior werd eveneens belachelijk gemaakt. Ik accepteer dat dit de realiteit is. Nederlanders zijn wie zij zijn, we gaan hen echt niet conservatiever maken. Maar als ambassadeur probeer ik wel de Amerikaanse boodschap uit te dragen, via grassroots bijeenkomsten in verschillende regio‚Äôs en met verschillende politieke partijen.‚Äù

**Dat laatste valt kennelijk nog niet mee: de recente historische doorbraak in het Midden Oosten ‚Äì de Abraham-akkoorden, waarin Isra√´l en enkele Arabische landen de relaties normaliseren ‚Äì werd in sommige media afgedaan als een ‚Äôdiplomatiek succesje‚Äô.**

‚ÄûDaar las ik inderdaad weinig over, tot mijn verbazing. Deze vredesakkoorden zijn baanbrekend en zullen enorme impact hebben op de regio en op de wereld. En het lijkt erop dat er nog meer aankomt, mogelijk een akkoord tussen Isra√´l en Saoedi-Arabi√´. Dat is absoluut huge. Drie jaar lang is onderhandelaar Jared Kushner, de schoonzoon van de president, belachelijk gemaakt: wat kan die nou bereiken, hij heeft geen enkel benul van buitenlandse politiek, was de teneur. En ineens bewerkstelligt Kushner de grootste diplomatieke doorbraak sinds 1979 doordat hij het aandurfde om het conflict van een heel andere kant aan te vliegen. Daar zou je meer lof voor verwachten.‚Äù

**U hamert, net als uw president, veelvuldig op het gevaar van China.**

‚ÄûJa, China zit stevig in onze hoofden. Hun illegale handelspraktijken bedreigen dagelijks Amerikaanse en Europese banen en ondernemingen. Elke dag komen we met de Europeanen dichter bij een begrip van de dreiging uit China. We hanteren misschien verschillende tactieken, maar ik zie een groeiend besef tussen de Europese Unie en de VS dat we een gemeenschappelijk probleem hebben. De volgende stap is: ok√©, laten we geco√∂rdineerde maatregelen nemen, want de VS kunnen dit niet alleen. Wij hebben 330 miljoen inwoners, de EU 445 miljoen, met het Verenigd Koninkrijk erbij is de economie van de EU groter dan de Amerikaanse. China heeft een bevolking van, hoeveel, 1,4 miljard mensen! We willen allemaal met China handeldrijven, maar alleen onder eerlijke voorwaarden en met eerlijke spelregels. We moeten ons goed realiseren dat Amerikanen en Europeanen op cruciale thema‚Äôs, waaronder ook het respect voor de democratische rechtsstaat, veel dichter bij elkaar staan dan Amerikanen en Chinezen of Europeanen en Chinezen. Dat verbindt ons.‚Äù

**Over het respect van Donald Trump voor de verkiezingsuitslag als hij mocht verliezen, maken sommige Nederlandse commentatoren zich zorgen. Zij vrezen dat hij niet zal opstappen.**

,,Zoiets heb ik ook begrepen, maar die gedachte is volstrekte nonsens. Ik weet niet waar de suggestie vandaan komt, maar de president heeft een contract met het Amerikaanse volk onder de constitutie en dat loopt na vier jaar af. Mocht Trump verliezen, dan gaat hij weg. Dan krijgen de Verenigde Staten een nieuwe president. Zo eenvoudig is het.‚Äù

**U zei ooit: op het gebied van islamistische terreur lopen de VS tien tot vijftien jaar achter bij Europa. Wat zeggen de recente terreuraanslagen in Frankrijk u?**

‚ÄûAls voorzitter van de commissie voor de inlichtingendiensten in het Congres had ik al intensieve contacten met de Nederlandse veiligheidsdiensten. Die waren heel goed in het beschermen van de Nederlandse bevolking, viel mij op. Andere landen hadden te kampen met grote terreuraanslagen maar Nederland niet. Ik was van hun werk onder de indruk. Natuurlijk woedt er een verhit debat over wat er in de komende jaren moet gebeuren in de strijd tegen de terreur. Maar kijk wat er al is gedaan: niet eens zo lang geleden was een groot deel van Irak en Syri√´ in handen van Islamitische Staat. Onder president Trump is daar een einde aan gemaakt. Dat is een heel positieve ontwikkeling.‚Äù

**De gemoederen in de VS lijken steeds hoger op te lopen. Bent u niet bang voor meer geweld?**

‚ÄûDe visies die tegenover elkaar staan zijn ook zo enorm verschillend. En hoewel de verkiezingen maar gaan over vier jaar, heeft het presidentschap wel grote gevolgen voor de toekomst. Maar ook toen wij Bill Clinton impeachten was er al sprake van een enorme kloof. Dat was geen gelukkige tijd. En ik herinner me nog die leus ten tijde van de Golfoorlog: ‚ÄôBush lied, our kids died‚Äô (Bush loog, onze kinderen stierven ‚Äì red.). In de Verenigde Staten zijn we eraan gewend om hardball politics te spelen, het gaat er bij ons ruig aan toe. Heel ander dan jullie consensuspolitiek, waarbinnen altijd weer coalities moeten worden gesmeed. Ik kom uit een systeem waarin voortdurend verkiezingen plaatshebben en campagne wordt gevoerd, van burgemeesters en lokale politiechefs tot de president. We weten niet beter.‚Äù

**Op 4 november is corona weg, zei Trump.**

‚ÄûHaha, de president is een bijzonder optimistische vent. Hij wil dingen graag snel voor elkaar krijgen en heeft van alles in gang gezet om zo snel mogelijk een vaccin te kunnen produceren. Overigens, tijdens de coronacrisis is wel gebleken hoe goed wij kunnen samenwerken. Wat het Westen heeft gepresteerd in de afgelopen maanden, de snelheid waarmee we een vaccin zullen hebben, de verbeterde medicatie die we hebben ontwikkeld, dat is ongekend. Neem jullie eigen Philips, dat heeft zijn beademingsapparatuur in de VS versneld kunnen produceren doordat president Trump een oorlogswet uit de jaren vijftig van stal haalde. Die zakelijke relaties waren er natuurlijk al, maar we hebben ze in deze moeilijke tijden snel weten te intensiveren.‚Äù

**Keert u na de verkiezingen terug?**

‚ÄûLaten we eerst maar eens de uitkomst van de verkiezingen afwachten. Maar normaal gesproken blijft een ambassadeur zo‚Äôn drie jaar en die zitten er voor mij bijna op. We gaan nu eerst naar huis, naar onze familie die we wegens corona al zo lang niet hebben gezien en we blijven in de VS om er Thanksgiving te vieren.‚Äù

**Wat gaat u missen aan Nederland?**

‚ÄûDe vele vriendelijke mensen natuurlijk en de schoonheid van het land. Als je op de fiets, in dat trage tempo, door het land reist, valt extra op hoe mooi het is: Flevoland, de Veluwe, Friesland, Zeeland. Mijn ouders spraken altijd over Paterswolde bij Groningen. Ik was daar als kind van nog geen 3, en nu was ik er op de fiets, op een zondagmiddag in de zomer, en reed rond het Paterswoldse meer.

*The 43rd Panzergrenadier-Battalion is a modern-era, NATO (Bundeswehr) vs Russia Cold-War themed unit. We are located in central Europe and have a diverse and friendly international playerbase.*

We don't have a mandatory attendance but would like you to sign out if you know you will not be able to make it. We play on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 2000/2100 CEST.

**What we offer**

*&gt; A new experience involving factions that you‚Äôve likely not played as before.*

*&gt; You are new to Arma 3 or Milsim? No problem! We are looking forward to teach you the things you need to know.*

*&gt; People that will be able to teach you new capabilities all around Arma's possibilities.*

*&gt; Learning new roles. We have experienced Squad Leaders that will train you to lead, we have experienced Milsim medics that will teach you how to properly use the ace medical system to full extense, etc. The range is vast and opens new doors for people looking for a newgrounds.*

*&gt; Plenty of space to progress throughout our ranks as we have a large spectrum of roles from Infantry to Tanking, from Rifleman to commanding officer.*

**Our playstyle**

*We strive to achieve a relatively realistic setting while also having very tight and fun community. This means we are perfectly fine with people having a laugh as long as they can switch back to a serious note once needed. We like to play Operations as tactically and strategically as possible without constant formations and the like. We play in First Person and use Advanced ACE Medical (We can teach you how to use it!).*

**What roles you can apply to**

*Of course no one wants to play a role they do not like, but fortunately you will not have that problem with us. We are still quite small and try to grow as fast as we can. This means you will be able to apply to advanced roles like pilots, vehicle crew, squadleader, teamleader, etc. quite fast. Also if you like zeusing we will probably have a slot for you doing that as well.*

**Requirements**

*&gt; Microphone*

Both Poland and Turkey were suppose to grow to great power status while the United Kingdom Italy and France would fall behind relative to their current status at the time. If you noticed, in reality both France and Germany have grown while both the Anglo sphere , the East Asian sphere, and the new great powers have lost. You pose an interesting comment, and worthy of research of what was going on in foreign affairs at the time of Edrogans election. Especially the United States and France would be worthy of studying. Maybe this was a power play by Germany and France, to the benefit of Russia as well. A great power in Poland and Turkey would limit or destroy their influence in Eastern Europe. I absolve the United States of knowing what Edorgan was, mostly because America only benefits from a stronger Poland/Turkish state. 

I also need to explain France and Germany so I am not downvoted to oblivion. French and German leadership have always been suspect of an American led world, with good reason. However they do not want a strong Russia, but rather a strong Europe. Poland and Turkey being great powers would do more damage to that vision because of nationalism in new world powers usually being stronger. Not always but usually. So if that report would have been correct, you would have a split Eastern Europe between Turkey and Poland, with France and Germany relegated into playing a game where American leadership could use Poland and Turkey to outweigh any French-German alliance inside the EU, thus making the EU a tool of the Anglo sphere or having an incoherent strategy between international rivals. 

Russia is also easy to explain, they want a strong enough EU to fight the US, but not strong enough to meddle in Russia 
‚ÄòS sphere of influence. So Russia has been pushing right winged society in both Poland and Turkey weakening them, while France and Germany have only made moves on paper to counter these moves. So why has n‚Äôt the United States tried to counter the Russian moves in either of these, either under Obama or Bush? Simple- no one cared. I think it‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious that America is sliding back to isolationism since the end of the Cold War. Whether that‚Äôs good or not is up to the reader. A multipolar world often means more conflict, but a unipolar world often means less mobility for nations. Of course you can also say that a Stronger more independent EU fits with in that vision of an isolation of the US. Allowing the traditional Western and central EU powers to dominate the affairs allows for a predictable and quiet Europe. 

So in conclusion, I-have little doubt that most of the intelligence agencies knew what edrogan was both politically and economically, but the real questions really are at the diplomatic level- who did or did not make moves to counter him and to what capacity.

Don't like reality, huh?

&gt;Two in three British Muslims would not give police terror tip-offs

behind a paywall before it goes into the detail of the survey.  I don't buy it.

&gt;Poll: 40% of UK Muslims want Sharia

Sharia isn't legal law.  Sharia is ""go to the mosque for a marriage contract"" to most Muslims.  Or personal law.  The survey itself is bias in it's questions.

&gt;Muslims in Britain have zero tolerance of homosexuality, says poll 2009

Just like many other religious groups.  They polled people at the mosque, when they polls Muslims outside of the mosques in France:

&gt;By comparison, 35% of French Muslims found homosexual acts to be acceptable

which follows a lot of the same patterns found in almost all religious groups.  Also, ""acceptable"" means a lot of things.  You can think it should be legal, but not accept it as a practice.  Muslims are no different from most westerners, who only about 50% of which started accepting homosexuality in the last 2 or so decades.

&gt; after a poll of 300 showed 80% saw nothing wrong in jihad, or holy war, against non-believers.

This is a bias question in itself.  the way Europeans see ""jihad"" is vastly different from the way Muslims do.  A ""jihad"" against non-believers implies the non-believers are trying to stop Muslims from being Muslims.  ""Jihad"" literally means ""struggle"", not ""holy war"" as the article claims.  This is why pregnancy and labor is considered a ""jihad"".  This is why literally going to work is considered a ""jihad"".  

&gt;52% of Sweden Muslims believe that Sharia is more important than Swedish law. 2015

All religious people believe their divine rules are more important than government rules.  This isn't unique to Muslims.  

&gt;Six out of ten mosques in Sweden gave women advice about how to deal with spousal abuse and polygamy that contradicted Swedish law, a media investigation has revealed. 2012

People are allowed to try to solve their problems with their communities and families before going to the law.  This is normal across ALL societies, including secular and atheist ones.

&gt;62 percent of Turks in Germany say that they prefer to be with Turks only. Almost half (46 percent) would like to see more Muslims than Christians living in Germany at some point.

This is also the same of every other people.  Germans prefer to be with germans.  Atheists prefer there were more atheists in their countries.  

&gt;42 per cent of Canadian Muslims believe the contrast between the West and Islamic cultures was irreconcilable.

CULTURES, not religion.  Islam has already westernized across the world.  There are mosques that accept the LGBT people, mosques that lecture in the native tongue, etc.  Yes, the culture of say, the Saudis doesn't mesh with the culture of Canadians.  But immigrants become the the native culture in just 1 generation.

&gt;So many memers doing these studies, right?

yes, you applied your memes to the studies to promote your bias.  You're insisting this is a problem with Islam or Muslims in general, and it's not.  You're insisting very human issues are worse when Muslims do it, and twisting surveys to fit your own bias.

&gt;Muslims are integrating/assimilating to western societies as fast as anybody else... right? You are a clown.

&gt;For instance, the vast majority of U.S. Muslims say they are proud to be American (92%), while nearly all say they are proud to be Muslim (97%). Indeed, about nine-in-ten (89%) say they are proud to be both Muslim and American.

&gt;Alan Manning and Sanchari Roy, economists at the London School of Economics, kick-started the literature on cultural assimilation with their 2007 paper testing whether Muslim immigrants in the U.K. assimilated any more slowly than other immigrants. Maybe, they conceded, policy interventions were needed if cultural assimilation of some groups was not fast enough. 

&gt;They concluded, however, that ‚Äúwe find no evidence for a culture clash in general, and one connected with Muslims in particular.‚Äù In other words, Muslim immigrants assimilate no slower than do any other immigrants.

&gt;Rigorous studies in other countries are unfortunately sparse. A study by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka looking at religiousness and other indicators of difference between Muslims and non-Muslims across Europe led the authors to conclude that ‚Äúdifferences[‚Ä¶]will continue to diminish‚Äù and that the data ‚Äúshows signs of convergence over time.‚Äù The sociologist Sabine Pokorny conducted a representative survey of immigrants in Germany for the CDU-affiliated Konrad Adenauer Foundation. She paid special attention to Muslim immigrants. Again it was found that assimilation was coming along apace and, interestingly, that Muslims were not more religious than Christians in Germany.

&gt;In 2014, German men between the ages of 14 and 30 made up 9% of the population and were responsible for half of all the country's violent crimes.

&gt;When it comes to the new arrivals, men aged 16 to 30 made up 27% of all asylum-seekers who came in 2015.

&gt;""It is because of the demographics,"" claims Dr Dominic Kudlacek, from the Criminological Research Unit of Lower Saxony. ""Whether they're asylum seekers or EU migrants, they are younger than the average population and mostly male. Young men commit more crimes in every society.""

""Black"" is absolutely not meant *specifically* for african americans. You can just as well call any african black. White literally just means european or of european descent. It's really, truly, not a difficult concept to grasp and I think you're being wilfully ignorant in not seeing it. The ""concept"" of being white didn't start anywhere because it's not a fucking concept, it's just reality. Some people ARE white, some people ARE black, some people ARE asian. This is observable reality, clear as day. 

The genetic differences between races *are* small in some areas. Generally speaking we are very similar, though as pointed out things like skull shape, melanin content, average height, hair colour and texture, etc are observably different. The main area where we differ is in IQ. The **average** (and this word is important) IQ of Ashkenazi jews tends to be the highest, followed by east asians, then whites, then hispanics and then blacks at the bottom. Whether you like it or not, IQ is one of the current best predictors for future success, and black people (and hispanics) generally have very low IQ's. This means that they don't integrate well into societies that place more importance on intelligence and the ability to perform intellectually. This is observable reality; majority black countries are shitholes and are almost unanimously third world (yes, even places that haven't been touched by any form of colonialism) and white countries are first world. There's also the issue of crime rates, which pretty much on-the-dot match IQ averages. Blacks commit vastly disproportionate amounts of crime wherever they go and hispanics commit a lot of crime too. Literally just look at FBI crime statistics, I don't have to read them out for you. Regarding black americans specifically, there is a large percentage of them that have the MAOA 2 gene that has been linked to aggressive and impulsive behaviour. 

The point of all this is that blacks are genetically pre-disposed to being more stupid, aggressive and impulsive than other races which links perfectly with how much crime they commit. Ergo they don't mesh well with western society and societal values. I can go on but you've likely heard all this before and are just unable to comprehend it. Also, your ""Sapiens"" link isn't a source of any kind. It's basically an opinion piece with some dates thrown around. No studies, no data.

I really, truly don't know how to explain to you how retarded you sound when you ask why it sucks to become a minority in your own country. Seriously, the only way I can explain you asking this question is if you yourself are not white (and therefore stand to benefit from becoming a more powerful majority in white countries), or if you're some self-hating white liberal college student who has been fed bullshit for 18 years.

I think this framing is acceptable because you would be hard pressed to find anyone in the current shadow cabinet admittig the prevalence of antisemitism within labour doesn't exceed that of the general population. 

The intention behind mentioning this fact isn't to downplay the hurt and fear of discrimination felt by the jewish community by the minority of labour members that somehow remained active for so long, but to counter the right wing press narrative that has successfully led the general public to believe 1/3 of labour members were under investigation for antisemitism. It is not fair to have to submit pver and over again, feeding the perception that labour is the antisemetoc party when time and time again we have had labour zionists and jewish intellectuals and academics come forward and claim  that this scandal has been blown out of all proportions for political reasons. 

That doesn't mean any jewish complainant is a bad actor(I don't think even 1% of them are) but that authoritative and prominent likud associated publications and community members have used the scandal to refer to Corbyn and his allies as the greatest threat to British Jews since Hitler and Enoch Powell, stirring up an already deeply traumatised community who can be forgiven for being extremely cautious. Which is a gross lie and heinous utilisation of the memory of the holocaust for political reasons(those reasons being to block the ascension of a Palestinian sympathiser to the highest office of one of Israel's most powerful allies) made by the far right religious wing of the UK zionist movement - which is of course a UK ally of Likud. Where people like me, and those who believe the things I do would normally advocate for the Labour zionist movement. You can question my intentions behind referring to these organisations and people all you like.

The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353[15] Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 4] and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. The surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[18][19] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, ""a date which will live in infamy"". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.Ôªø",True,False,False,,,,0,1604251233,,False,0,{},gat4mtj,False,t3_bvvfqg,False,True,t3_bvvfqg,/r/u_MalboMX/comments/bvvfqg/try_suicide_guy_on_steam/gat4mtj/,False,,1615948676,1,True,False,u_MalboMX,t5_cb7kc,u/MalboMX,user,,0,[],

Just forbid immigrants from getting welfare. That's how the Arab oil states currently work: they take a portion of the oil money and dole it out to native citizens, so they can be fat lazy and happy, having to do no work of any kind (and don't revolt against the monarchy) and then they bring in scads and scads of foreign ""guest workers"" who do all the work in the country and get no welfare.

The US already has laws on the books forbidding legal immigrants from receiving most forms of means-tested welfare. Why then can't we have open borders and immigration at the same time, if immigrants are barred from receiving welfare?

Secondly: how do you propose we abolish the welfare state? Do you know how popular Social Security is among Americans? How about Medicare? 

You'll find super-majorities of voters support the continued existence of these programs, super-majorities oppose *any* reform or reduction of these programs, and a slim majority would make them *even more generous.*

Saying ""We need to abolish welfare first, then open the borders"" is just a smokescreen for ""We should never open the borders, so we can have a perpetual welfare state.""---carrying water for Progressives and Conservatives alike! A libertarian should be ashamed of such a thing.

Voters like welfare. It's an unbreakable cycle. You steal voters' money in a hidden way and then give some back in an ostentatious way, thus convincing them perpetually of the need for welfare and how good and beneficial welfare is. The only way to get rid of welfare is either to go bankrupt (but even here, as we've seen in Greece or Venezuela, voters continue to demand welfare even as the country literally goes bankrupt).....*or* to change the demographics of *who* is receiving welfare.

Open the borders first, and the abolition of welfare will follow. It makes perfect sense, because more homogeneous societies have, on average, [more generous welfare states.](https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d19/d1972.pdf) Why? Because people support welfare only if they think their money is being taken from themselves and being given to people similar to themselves. When you bring in a bunch of damn dirty foreigners into your country, support for welfare declines. When people perceive welfare as mainly benefiting an out-group instead of their own in-group, they are more likely to oppose welfare.

When asked about budget cuts and what government program needs to be reduced or eliminated, why do you think Americans consistently name foreign aid as the No. 1 choice? Why do you think Americans think foreign aid comprises 10% of all spending when it's less than half of one percent?

Why do you think Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society"" coincided with the moment in American history when immigration to the US was nearly at an all-time low and the percentage of foreign-born people living in the US *was* the lowest it has ever been in US history?

Why do you think the US refrained from building a welfare state in the 1900s, when we had open borders, and yet all the European countries were beginning to construct welfare states?

Americans, and most people, are prejudiced against outsiders and intrinsically resent the idea of having their tax money taken from them and given to an outsider. Furthermore, if we have open borders, then we can get conservatives to get serious about abolishing welfare. Currently, conservatives actually *like* welfare and, in a way, are the biggest defenders of the welfare state. Open the borders and that will change, because their No. 1 priority will be trying to stop those ""damn dirty foreigners"" from coming here at all, and in their warped world-view, they think welfare is the main reason why immigrants come here.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604251736,,1604260768,0,{},gat5ljz,False,t3_jm0a0k,False,True,t1_gat2kli,/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/jm0a0k/trump_is_both_abusing_his_power_and_not_doing/gat5ljz/,False,,1615949142,3,True,False,Anarcho_Capitalism,t5_2qorf,r/Anarcho_Capitalism,public,,0,[],

My place is limited to an L shape, 2.40mX2.30m. My scale is HO and I'll use old Marklin M track, because that's what I have and I actually like those (also, I don't want to invest in new track).

I'm not interested in switching operations, I mainly want a nice layout to run my trains in a not-too-boring way, and to make a nice scenery over the time. It'll be a European scenery, quite rural, but without a very precise era because I have trains from a BR81 to an ICE :)

If you guys have any suggestion, I'll be happy to take some ideas !

This would be done in stages from Labrador to the UK, via Greenland and Iceland. There are more refined plans for a line from Iceland to Europe, and this would probably have to be built well before a connection to Labrador is ever considered. Iceland has the potential for excess clean power, and the political and financial apatite in Europe, both from the public and private sectors favour getting off fossil fuel energy. With Germany on track to decommission their nuclear plants in the near future, they are ramping up coal generation as a stop gap.

Of course it would be much closer and easier to export to the US, but there's a possibility for both in a perfect world. The demand peaks of North America and Europe differ by 5-6 hours so there is a pretty large window in which Newfoundland could sell clean power to meet demand. This would also make a strong case for building Gull Island.

Director: Francis Ford Coppola

&gt; This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name. A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. In Britain, Dracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 58 critics with an average rating of 6\.6\/10\. The site's consensus reads, ""Overblown in the best sense of the word, Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Bram Stoker's Dracula rescues the character from decades of campy interpretations‚Äîand features some terrific performances to boot."" Vincent Canby described the film as having been created with the ""enthusiasm of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master's command of his craft."" Richard Corliss said, ""Coppola brings the old spook story alive...Everyone knows that Dracula has a heart; Coppola knows that it is more than an organ to drive a stake into. To the director, the count is a restless spirit who has been condemned for too many years to interment in cruddy movies. This luscious film restores the creature's nobility and gives him peace."" Alan Jones in Radio Times said, ""Eerie, romantic and operatic, this exquisitely mounted revamp of the undead legend is a supreme artistic achievement...as the tired count who has overdosed on immortality, Gary Oldman's towering performance holds centre stage and burns itself into the memory.""

Africa did have wheels, even earlier than Europe in some parts, but wheels really aren't that great.

In Europe's mild climate, it's easy to maintain roads, but in Africa's harsh climate and terrain, wheels are useless. Add to that that the continent has a massive jungle in the middle, and massive deserts, and it's easy to see why wheels didn't catch on. So they did have wheels, they just abandoned them because they are useless in Africa.

Similarly, Africa did have written languages and cities, but most got destroyed during colonialism.

Lots of reasons. Look at America. If the Native Americans had resistance to smallpox, they'd probably still own this land. Or if you reversed the diseases, and the Natives gave untreatable infectious disease to the Europeans, they may well have conquered the Old World. 

Having immunity to smallpox isn't like some function of brainpower. It's luck. 

Likewise, for centuries Poland was overrun by the Mongols, while England wasn't. Is that because England had some super smart Mongol-fighting technology? No. They're just farther away from Mongolia. Whether or not a country got conquered by the Mongols has very little to do with brainpower and much more to do with 1) proximity to Mongolia, 2) water barriers between you and Mongolia and 3) mountains between you and Mongolia.

That's it.

So yeah, if human intelligence was the only way to become the 'greatest country on Earth' then sure, you'd make a lot of sense. But that's usually not the case.

I completely disagree with a lot of this! Maybe this is just from the perspective of an FSO, and maybe you lived in different places than I did, but I wanted to just give another opinion on a couple of the things you said.

1. Generally wages are higher in places that are more expensive. You talk about Switzerland will bankrupt people, but I don't know anyone making less than 20 CHF/hr. My friend working at a gas station earned 25 an hour.
2. I agree housing here is on a different scale than many other places, but the obvious reason for that is that we have a lot less space in Europe. This is a drawback, but saying that smaller places mean lower quality of life is not an opinion I agree with. A lot of people raise families in apartments.
3. VAT changes depending on the country. In Italy, it is 22%, in Germany 19% but in Switzerland it is only 7.7%. This also only applies to stuff like electronics, etc, food and drink is taxed at a way lower rate. Usually prices are higher due to the exchange rate, but taxes have little to do with the bottom-line price usually.
4. Europe wasn't built with cars in mind. Public transportation and biking are the normal ways of getting around here. My experience with these things has been a lot better than yours. In CH everything is immaculately clean, in Germany everything is also very clean, and France/Italy are far from what I would describe as dirty. Public transport is also no longer confusing in the age of smartphones, where all the information is available on Google Maps/the respective transport apps. The transportation is also very punctual.
5. Using the term ""underdeveloped"" to describe a lack of air conditioning is grossly overstating the reality. In France, Spain and Italy (the warmer places) I have yet to be anywhere without A/C. In CH and Germany, it is not required, because it is only hot enough for it a couple weeks out of a year.
6. My experience with medicine here has been great. I have always gotten great doctors and my wait has never been long. The only bad experiences I have had were in Germany, and that is because instead of completely socializing the medicine they have a stupid system in which private insurance is more accepted than the public option.
7. Hospitals have the same, if not better tech and techniques than in the USA. I had a knee surgery in the US a couple years ago, and when I went to the doctor in Germany for a checkup he laughed, saying the technique they used had not been used in Germany for 10 years.

However, the austerity measures were counterproductive and if the goal was for Greece to reform its institutions sustainably and pay back its debt, the ECB, IMF, and the EC did the equivalent of trying to put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it. 

Probably the best illustration of this is that Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio [rose from 126.7% to 175.2% from 2009 to 2011](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en) on account of the austerity measures that [reduced Greek GDP significantly](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=GR) and therefore made the debt problem worse as lower consumption and incomes on account of the tax increases and public spending cuts resulted in a [decrease in government revenue](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REVGRC). All the austerity measures did was lead to widespread suffering and unemployment for the Greek people, it didn't help Greece reform its institutions of the structural factors that caused the crisis to occur and it actually made it *more difficult* for Greece to pay back its debt. 

To draw a comparison to the U.S. and the current economic fallout from COVID-19, imagine if there was an external body that prevented the U.S. from passing the CARES Act and any and all other forms of fiscal stimulus, and handicapped the Federal Reserve to prevent it from engaging in any form of open market operations (Greece, as a member of the Eurozone, had no independence in setting monetary policy), and not only that but we were forced to raise taxes and cut spending at the same time people were losing their jobs en masse and would thus have less of a means to support them during the downturn.

First, go to scryfall.com and browse legends by typing in ""t:legend t:creature"". You can look on scryfall for a bunch of other modifiers if you've already got an idea. 

Once you've picked a commander it's time to set a budget. Whatever you feel like spending you can make it work. I've built decks for less than 5 dollars, they're not the best, but they can still be fun. 

Okay, now I would go to edhrec and startup a deck list on another site like untapped. Just start throwing in cards that you think are cool. Don't worry about the budget yet, or going over 100 cards, just throw stuff in. Scryfall is also useful here, let's say you wanna look at cards for [[teysa karlov]], start digging with a search term like ""o:die commander:WB t:creature"" to find cards that have death triggers and are the right colors.

Okay, next I think about the manabase. Conventional EDH wisdom says you should probably have around 37 lands in the deck. And unless you're mono colored you probably don't wanna play all basics. Scryfall is super helpful if you're on a budget, you can type in ""t:land usd&lt;5"" for all lands less than 5 dollars. Whatever number works. Then sort the cards by their edhrec rank. Pick a bunch of lands till you've got a decent looking manabase. Make sure to leave maybe 2-5 basics of each color in though.

Okay, now we start thinking what we'll need. This deck's more flavour than flame, so we're gonna take a look at the massive list of potential cards you've already made. Firstly sort them into these categories. Ramp, spot removal, board wipes, card advantage, endgame, other. Strategy depending, you want 2-5 board wipes, 3-7 spot removals (spot removal should be either efficient i.e. path to exile or versatile i.e. anguished unmaking, not so much value generation). You want maybe 7-12 ramp sources, there's plenty to find in edhreca top cards list https://edhrec.com/top. Next we want some card generation i.e phyrexian arena, this can be anywhere from 2-10 cards strategy depending.

All EDH decks need all of those things. You fill those up, and then you start adding in your spicy cards. Ideally you find cards that are in budget, fit the role and have synergy with your commander. Then start cutting to fit budget and card limits until you have something. Finally, export your deck list to txt and stick it into an online store like cardmarket.eu for european or tcgplayer for americans (many alternatives exist).

&gt; 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Europe&amp;#039;s new COVID-19 cases have doubled in five weeks, propelling the region on Sunday across the bleak milestone of 10 million total infections, according to a Reuters tally.

&gt; While Europe almost took nine months to record its first 5 million COVID-19 cases, the next 5 million cases were reported in slightly over a month, according to a Reuters analysis.

&gt; Within the region, Eastern Europe has nearly one-third of the total reported COVID-19 cases, the highest number of cases, while Southern Europe leads the death toll with about 32% of the total coronavirus-related deaths in Europe, according to a Reuters analysis.

When people criticize racism in western europe or the usa. You see that's as criticism against ""white people"" or western culture. Because you look at the world through that lense.   

You use racist logic to explain the crimes of certain  black individuals as somehow reflecting some kind of characteristic intrinsic to some fictional idea of ""black identity"" .

When people talk about racism in western europe. Then obviously ""white"" people will get most of the blame. Because they are the majority and hold the most power. That's just a fact. Not some kind of conspiracy made to attack people of a certain skin colour.

&gt;The untold story of a heroic band of Caribbean pirates whose defiance of imperial rule inspired revolt in colonial outposts across the world. In the early eighteenth century, the Pirate Republic was home to some of the great pirate captains, including Blackbeard, ""Black Sam"" Bellamy, and Charles Vane. Along with their fellow pirates‚Äîformer sailors, indentured servants, and runaway slaves‚Äîthis ""Flying Gang"" established a crude but distinctive democracy in the Bahamas, carving out their own zone of freedom in which servants were free, blacks could be equal citizens, and leaders were chosen or deposed by a vote. They cut off trade routes, sacked slave ships, and severed Europe from its New World empires, and for a brief, glorious period the Republic was a success.

I have been working from home since March and so the isolation is really starting to kick in with the restrictions.  I live on the outskirts so don‚Äôt get into town much but last week I cycled to Leith and can‚Äôt believe the number of people around.  Stockbridge was also hellish.  

I booked a week of annual leave just as Nicola Sturgeon announced the current circuit breaker a few weeks ago.  Gutted as I had been working long weeks for the months running up to it and needed to get out and enjoy myself!   But glad we did.  Watching England once again go into a lockdown too late is frightening. It‚Äôs going to be a long winter.  

The US election has myself (and my friends) nervous right now as a Trump victory would not be good for our ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù trade deal post Brexit in January.  Also what happens in the US tends to cross the Atlantic.  The shift to more right wing and fascist views are worrying.  Though when trump announced Farage as the ‚ÄúKing of Europe‚Äù it made me chuckle- I think that was the last thing Farage would ever want to be called! It just shows Trumps lack of geopolitical awareness.

Oh, et quand on dit ""lib√©ral"", ""conservateur"", ""d√©mocrate"", ""r√©publicain"", leur significations ne sont absolument pas les m√™mes en France qu'aux USA.

Pour √ßa, lire le sublimissime texte de R√©gis Debray, ""[√ätes-vous D√©mocrate ou R√©publicain ?](https://www.les-crises.fr/etes-vous-democrate-ou-republicain-par-regis-debray/)"", o√π on s'aper√ßoit qu'aux USA, les R√©publicains sont en r√©alit√© d√©mocrates, et les D√©mocrates sont en r√©alit√© r√©publicains...

Cela dit, pour revenir au Japon, toute soci√©t√© est profond√©ment ancr√©e dans sa culture, laquelle est form√©e par l'Histoire, qui est fa√ßonn√©e par la g√©ographie (pas moyen d'√©chapper √† l'Histoire-G√©o!).

Une soci√©t√© Anglo-Saxonne sera individualiste (lire ""petite-bourgeoise"") et √† terme, puritaine.

Commen√ßons avec l'Angleterre, que je comparerai √† la Doulce France.

On a du monde pris sur une petite √Æle assez pauvre, en comp√©tition avec (pour la noblesse) la M√®re Patrie (le regrett√© prof. Robitaille de l'institut de Recherches Nucl√©aires* de Saclay disait ""L'Angleterre est une colonie Fran√ßaise qui a mal tourn√©""...). √âtant tr√®s pauvre, cette √Æle a t√¥t du commercer avec l'√©tranger, voire √† √©tablir des colonies. Comparativement, la France, ce doulx pays de cocagne a toujours eu ce dont elle avait besoin, et n'a donc pas d√©velopp√© cette mentalit√© petite bourgeoise.

Durant l'√¢ge des d√©couvertes, l'Angleterre a √©tendu un empire colonial (que la France n'a sing√© que parce que c'√©tait √† la mode) rapidement devenu indispensable √† sa survie. Et la mont√©e du protestantisme et ses valeurs ax√©es sur l'ancien testament, dont notamment la responsabilit√© individuelle a entra√Æn√© une hausse d'influence pour la bourgeoisie, qui s'enrichissait constamment.

Faisons un moment un pas en arri√®re, en 1215, quand une poign√©e de barons v√©reux ont arrach√© √† un roi faible, Jean Sans-Terre (j'ai eu, une ann√©e, un instituteur nomm√© Robert Santerre), la ""magna carta"", qui √©tablissait des droits pour les nobles tout en sapant l'autorit√© du roi et de l'√âtat. Rien de tel en France, o√π le roi pouvait proclamer sans rire ""l'√âtat, c'est moi!"". Alors, petit √† petit, la notion s'est faite que les ""droits"" des barons pouvaient √™tre progressivement √©tablis √† tout le monde, du moins ceux qui peuvent se permettre de payer pour faire respecter ses droits. 

C'est ainsi que la bourgeoisie a pu compl√®tement subvertir le gouvernement Britannique. On peut le voir par leur syst√®me √©lectoral o√π, jusqu'il y a un si√®cle environ, seuls les propri√©taires terriens poss√©dant plus d'une certaine valeur (qui m'√©chappe et dont j'ai compl√®tement la flemme de rechercher vu que √ßa a pas vraiment rap) avaient le droit de vote.

C'est ainsi que les Anglo-Saxons, dont l'√©volution sociale a pu prendre tout son essor aux USA, sont devenus une soci√©t√© tr√®s petite-bourgeoise, o√π les individus sont responsables d'eux-m√™mes. 

Cette soci√©t√© petite-bourgeoise en est venu a absolument d√©tester les pauvres, car les consid√©rant d√©nu√©s de morale (sans morale, on ne travaille pas, d'o√π pauvret√©), et en tant que tels, ils doivent absolument √™tre punis, d'o√π la myriade de lois sp√©cialement √©dict√©es contre les pauvres. On y trouve le paroxysme aux USA o√π les pauvres sont absolument submerg√©s par les amendes donn√©es par un syst√®me punitif √©rig√© par l'administration (par exemple: on ne peut pas payer son assurance, hop! contredanse! Il faut passer au tribunal, mais si on se pr√©sence, on perd son boulot. Et hop! Mandat d'arr√™t, et quand on se fait alpaguer, hop! Prison, tant qu'on ne paye pas les amendes dues. Et pour empirer les choses, beaucoup de prisons font payer leur s√©jour aux d√©tenus!!!)

Par contre, les riches ont toute la latitude voulue pour exploiter leurs employ√©s, car les lois cens√©es les prot√©ger ne sont, √©videmment, pas claironn√©es sur les toits, mais pour entreprende une action, il faut se payer un avocat.

Aux USA, le racisme a toujours √©t√© utilis√© pour diviser la population.

Dans une telle soci√©t√©, les pauvres blancs ne sont pas porter √† voter √† gauche, parce que la propagande leur fait croire que la gauche va les taxer pour donner aux noirs qui ne foutent rien; cette m√™me propagande qui leur fait croire que si ils ""travaillent fort"", ils vont devenir millionnaires.

C'est un syst√®me extr√™mement pourri par une mentalit√© rapace et √©go√Øste qui, √† cause de la magna carta, en vient √† penser que les individus sont plus importants que la Soci√©t√©, et que les riches ont raison, parce qu'ils sont b√©nis par Dieu car ils ont la moralit√© requise pour travailler beaucoup plus que les pauvres.

Une autre constante d'une soci√©t√© Anglo-Saxonne est l'assomption imm√©diate que l'√âtat est mauvais, que le gouvernement est inapte et que tout ce qui vient de l'√âtat doit √™tre vu avec la plus extr√™me suspiction.

L'aboutissment logique est une administration compl√®tement d√©ficiente et incomp√©tente, car les gens intelligents travailleront pour eux-m√™mes, ou pour une compagnie qui les r√©num√©rera √† leur juste valeur. 

C'est diam√©tralement oppos√© √† la France et ses Grandes √âcoles, et o√π travailler pour l'√©tat n'est pas consid√©r√© comme une tare sociale. Ce n'est donc pas √©tonnant que la France, comme √©tat, soit g√©r√©e plus efficacement; je mettrai en exemple le TGV, produit pas la SNCF et tout son r√©seau de polytechniciens qui ont su produire le TGV, qui a montr√© au monde que le chemin-de-fer n'√©tait pas un cul-de-sac technologique, comme la pens√©e bagnolarde et avionneuse des ann√©es 60 le faisait penser, mais une technologie promise √† un bel avenir.

35 ans plus tard, la Chine avait plus de 10,000 kilom√®tres de lignes nouvelles √† grande vitesse; l'une d'elle que j'empruntais r√©guli√®rement se targue m√™me d'avoir le plus long viaduc du monde: plus de 160 kilom√®tres!

Ce n'est pas pour rien que les USA et les Rosbifs ont des r√©seaux ferroviaires archi-nuls: l'entreprise priv√©e qui y domine, adepte de la solution la moins ch√®re √† court terme, n'aurais jamais accept√© l'investissement √† long terme n√©c√©ssaire.

Par exemple, la SNCF a enti√®rement financ√© elle-m√™me le TGV sans la moindre aide de l'√âtat. Une fois la ligne Paris_Lyon ouverte, il n'a fallu que NEUF ANS pour repayer le co√ªt des 30 ann√©es de recherche n√©c√©ssaires pour mettre au point la technologie, l'achat des terrains n√©c√©ssaires, la construction des voies-ferr√©es et l'achat des rames de TGV. Depuis 1990, donc, tout le fric qui rentre dans les poches de la SNCF avec le TGV sont du profit pur et simple. Quand on raconte √ßa √† au p√©kin lambda Amerlok, son cerveau ne peut absolument pas comprendre, parce que son cerveau a √©t√© engraiss√© √† la propagande petite-bourgeoise o√π n'importe-quoi qui appartient √† l'√âtat ne peut rien faire de bon.

Ce qui m'a le plus fait rire, ce sont les autobus Londoniens exploit√©s par... la RATP! Suite √† la privatisation des transports, le march√© a √©t√© pris par la RATP, cr√©ature √©tatique par excellence; c'est pour dire non-seulement l'incomp√©tence des haut-fonctionnaires rosbifs, mais √©galement des entrepreneurs priv√©s, qui se font damer le pion par une compagnie appartenant √† l'√âtat Fran√ßais!!! Et la SNCF tire aussi son jeu dans ce march√© l√†.

Et maintenant, la gangr√®ne petite-bourgoise envahit la France et pourrit toutes les institutions en les subvertissant une apr√®s-l'autre, et le paroxysme est atteint sous Maqueron qui veut mordicus instaurer un syst√®me petit-bourgreois directement calqu√© sur les Amerloks.

J'ai vraiment peur pour la France o√π la menace islamique fait compl√®tement le jeu des bougreois en instaurant une peur que les islamo-gauchistes ne seront jamais capable de venir √† bout, vu leur insistance √† ne pas comprendre la menace islamique et leur aveuglement qui ne les fait plus conspuer l'opium du peuple.

You‚Äôve created a bit of a straw man here‚Äîwho has said that criticism of Islam should be banned? 

Second, among Islamic scholars who prohibited and punished blasphemy, they themselves made a distinction between criticism of religion and blasphemy.

A Christian who calls Jesus the ‚Äúson of God‚Äù has made a blasphemous statement from the perspective of Islam. But Muslim scholars have defended their right to do so, since they are allowed to practice their religion. Meaning, simply making a statement that is in contradiction to Islam is not ‚Äúblasphemy.‚Äù There is also a long tradition going back to the founding of Islam of actively debating people of other religions, which implies that those non-Muslims will necessarily make ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù statements. But this is protected speech under shariah law. Point here simply being that the issue is not really about protecting the right to criticize a religion, but about a certain type of speech. 

The current backlash is against intentionally antagonistic and insulting speech, such as the caricatures of Muhammad. French Muslims are a vulnerable minority in France‚Äîpoor, segregated, and largely the descendants of former colonial subjects‚Äîare actively discriminated against, antagonized, and limited in their practice of their religion (French secularism, which is very strict). 

To ignore the social and political context‚Äîand place the debate in a sanitized arena where different groups are on equal footing‚Äîis to ignore the root of the issue. There is a perception‚Äîright or wrong‚Äîthat the West is at war with Islam and Islamic values. France was the last European power to relinquish control of its Arab colonies, and was arguably the most brutal‚Äîactively suppressing Islam and destroying mosques. Last month Macron announced a massive crackdown on the Muslim community‚Äîthat was before the latest cartoon-related attack. This is the context in which these cartoons are made, and this is the context in which people are angry about them. 

And it‚Äôs hard to argue that these cartoons and other racist, denigrating speech is not fueling violence and discrimination. A healthy society is one where people can share their opinions but also one in which the racial and religious majority is not using the media and organs of the state to assault a religious and ethnic minority. 

There is also tension between the individualist perspective‚Äîwhere there are no communities but only individuals with varying identities‚Äîand the communitarian one. Individualists break down hate speech and free speech based on whether it is focused on an individual or group. A man who calls all African Americans the N-word is using free speech; but a man who calls a specific individual African American the N-word can be punished for using so-called ‚Äúfighting words.‚Äù 

But people who are part of a minority group might perceive attacks on the group as an attack at the individual level. It‚Äôs easier for one who is in the majority to separate themselves from the group; an individual in the minority doesn‚Äôt enjoy the same privilege.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604265175,,False,0,{},gatx7kh,False,t3_jm4k4i,False,False,t3_jm4k4i,/r/changemyview/comments/jm4k4i/cmv_blasphemy_or_criticism_of_religion_is_not/gatx7kh/,False,,1615962238,13,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,1,[],

Por que h√° mais homens gays do que mulheres gays? Conversei esses dias com meu psic√≥logo sobre esse assunto por cima, e acho que o que realmente acontece √© que se d√° mais ""holofote"" para os homens gays do que para as mulheres, j√° que um relacionamento entre dois homens choca mais a sociedade, um pouco diferente de um relacionamento entre mulheres. N√£o estou dizendo que mulheres l√©sbicas est√£o isentas de ""chocar"" a sociedade, mas nossa sociedade j√° enxerga as mulheres como pessoas ""naturalmente"" mais afetuosas do que homens, por isso algumas coisas podem passar despercebidas. O impacto parece ser maior entre homens.


O mesmo pode se aplicar √† quest√£o das mulheres e homens trans. N√£o √© porque se fala menos em homens trans que necessariamente h√° menos homens do que mulheres trans, s√≥ n√£o h√° a mesma ""visibilidade"" talvez. Uso a palavra visibilidade entre aspas porque o que ocorre n√£o √© bem uma visibilidade de mulheres trans, j√° que muitas vezes elas s√£o retratadas de forma c√¥mica/estereotipada, mas elas s√£o mais retratadas e conhecidas do que os homens trans.


Um relato pessoal como exemplo: eu nunca tinha ouvido falar sobre homens trans. Sempre achei que eu era uma menina l√©sbica de trejeitos masculinos. S√≥ com meus 18 anos (uns 5 anos atr√°s) √© que ouvi falar no Tumblr pela primeira vez e fui pesquisar mais sobre, e s√≥ depois disso √© que eu descobri o que eu realmente era. Foi estranho no come√ßo, me autodenominar como ""trans"" porque, pra mim, s√≥ existiam mulheres trans (e daquele jeito estereotipado ainda).

Initial Process : 

Upon acceptance of IG request, got verified with ID selfie (all but name &amp; DOB redacted); directed to text a number to text for meetup appointments in NE DC.

Service Review : 

IG and Text reps were both punctual and friendly, answered questions on strains and donations without judgement. Meetup was speedy yet efficient, and Entourage was flexible around travel schedule. No delivery fee, no mix match fee (within same tiers), no service fee. 

As an added bonus, for the first meetup Entourage provided a complimentary king-size pre-roll gift üéÅ which contained Grape Ape üçáüêí. Surprise favorite, keeping my eye out for that one next time. This is how prerolls should be done, generously packed, expertly rolled, with flower selections from their lineup instead of with shake or stemmy by-product. 

Overall positive first &amp; second meetup experiences (1 week apart), overall customer service is good, I would rank it below DC Direct, DistrictFlorist, BBB &amp; DC Dabbler in terms of meetup flexibility, accessibility, response speed &amp; friendliness. 

Flower Review : 

Entourage's flower quality was certainly impressive across the board considering its West Coast imported nature, but overall they weren't as fresh or as pungent as locally sourced flower. 

On my first run, I tried four flavors in the bottom two tiers: Bubba &amp; Blueberry Cough in Premium (40/70/130/240) and Lemon OG &amp; Creamsicle in Top Shelf (50/90/160/280). 

For my second run a week later, I settled on their NYC Sour Diesel in the Exotic Tier (60/110/200/380). 

Ultimately, I would rank them numerically in the following order : NYC Diesel &gt; Bubba &gt; Creamsicle &gt; Blueberry Cough &gt; Lemon OG.

Bubba was a great value pick, BB Cough &amp; Creamsicle were nice, Lemon OG was just ok. The NYC Diesel, while really nice flavor, imo belongs in the Top Shelf tier; at nearly 400 a zip, it doesn't beat DF's, DC Dabbler's, or BBB's flower at similar price points. At least with those three, they run smaller, more focused operations, so I trust the QC/QA to ensure the flower is organic and PGR-free. Best comparison I can draw for NYC Diesel is DCD's Runtz Jack &amp; Runtz offerings from the other month, which were priced at around 60/120/150/300 &amp; 65/130/175/350, respectively. Emphasis on maximizing bag appeal &amp; aroma over potency, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

In Heathenry, moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse sagas. Evoking a life-affirming ethos, Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor, courage, integrity, hospitality, and hard work, and strongly emphasize loyalty to family. It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word, particularly sworn oaths. There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility, and a common motto within the Heathen community is that ""We are our deeds"".

https://i.imgur.com/85tkZXX.png

I can log in and have the address automatically taken from my address list or I can select a country other than Japan in the drop-down list. Previously I could also set the country to Japan by entering a valid Japanese postal number, for example 100-0001 for the imperial palace or 100-2100 for [Okinotorishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinotorishima) and various other uninhabited islands. It's no longer possible to enter a Japanese postal number and Japan does not appear in the drop-down list. How do I set the address to Japan without having to log in?

I need to set the address to Japan in two situations. First, there's an issue with Amazon being unable to send books to Europe if the weight is unknown and the weight of pre-order books is always unknown. The shipping cost depends on the weight and the shipping cost is unknown if the weight is unknown. The search engine won't find books which Amazon won't ship internationally unless I set the country to Japan. I want to be able to keep track of soon to be published books and if it's a limited edition then I may have to order it to a freight forwarder instead as it could sell out before the weight becomes known to Amazon.

Secondly, if I'm ordering used items, then Amazon won't list marketplace sellers which don't ship to my country. Unless the items are fulfilled by Amazon, I need to send them to a freight forwarder anyway and then it doesn't matter if they ship to my country or not. Due to high costs for the postal service to submit a customs declaration, I need to combine multiple small items to a single big shipment using a freight forwarder so that I don't pay the postal service's customs clearance handling fee more than once. The few sellers which are shown, if any, often charge high prices.

The first problem can be solved by using a Japanese proxy server or VPN. If it's a product which has an ISBN, I could find the item from a different shop, convert the ISBN-13 to ISBN-10 format and manually create an Amazon URL. However, both solutions are unnecessarily cumbersome.

I don't want to use a VPN to hide my country of residence in the second situation as I'm worried that Amazon could suspect fraud if the IP address belongs to a VPN. I don't wish to log in until I'm placing the order as it's much easier to empty the shopping basket (if I add the wrong item to it) if I'm not logged in. Then I can simply clear all cookies and the shopping basket is empty. If I'm logged in, then I have to click on a delete link for each item.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604268376,,False,0,{},gau3jce,False,t3_jicl3z,False,True,t3_jicl3z,/r/amazon/comments/jicl3z/weekly_help_and_discussion_thread_for_the_week_of/gau3jce/,False,,1615965234,1,True,False,amazon,t5_2qjnx,r/amazon,public,,0,[],

I live in south east Asia.  Grew up in Europe. Am Chinese.  Growing up everyday we had bone broth, either chicken or pork with vegetables. Every meal would be rice and other dishes. Salt fish, fried fish, stir fry vegetables, stews, there‚Äôs meat in everything. Mostly chicken and pork and fish.  With my parents we never had lamb, sheep, hardly ever beef (only few times per year).  We were kind of poor.  We didn‚Äôt have fast food. 
Every meal had meat, once a week we would have a whole snapper fish, a whole chicken and a book size piece of belly pork with the ribs on.  This is for 9 people but 7 were kids. We didn‚Äôt roast or bake anything, the oven was never used. Everything was either steamed, boiled, stir fried or stewed.  We never really had anything deep fried either. For snacks we would have peanut butter or jam sandwiches or cereal but I never saw my parent eat these things and we never had curry at home. Food was flavoured with salt, soy sauce, msg and fish sauce. Ginger, garlic and spring onions were the herbs.  Strangely growing up we didn‚Äôt really have any tofu because we couldn‚Äôt buy any, the chineseshops were pretty far. My dad went shopping weekly and bought can food, milk, bread and cereal from the supermarket and everything else from the outdoor market. We had fruit after every meal. 

Now, I eat fast food as a treat. Have biscuits and chocolate in the house.  Meals are porridge, fruits, smoothies, coffee.  Pasta, stir fries, rice, curries (we never had curries as a kid). Mash potatoes meal, roast potatoes meal. I try to limit vegan sausages and nuggets etc.  
I don‚Äôt have to have designated breakfast foods for breakfast, I can have noodles and curry and pizza for breakfast. I live with western partner so that would influence my home food, i like to cook meals they miss and/or can‚Äôt buy easily.  We bake cakes because it‚Äôs hard to find vegan cakes here. 


 I never would have thought I would go vegan but I read some books and oh - that‚Äôs not good at all! And made a change.  I tell my dad not to eat meat, he says he doesn‚Äôt eat much.

Maybe there's something to be said about class or historical trends of colonization and cultural loss we can talk about when it comes to African and indigenous populations but to describe it as in terms of just whiteness also takes away a lot of the picture. For example, epigenetics might explain some aspects in terms of a heightened stress response over generations of those trends I talked about above---and if you've ever been anxious then you know that you too would have a certain attitude if it meant the protection of your self esteem. Maybe the indigenous/black folks who survived colonization were the ones who fought back and focused on themselves and their local communities, which would be a selective pressure to distrust white people and to have a self-first approach to problem solving. We just don't know until we do more research. Your explanation ignores how lighter skinned people end up being treated as better, expected to act of a ""higher class"" than browner folks, and your Eurocentric examples don't justify the rest of your arguments. 

For a counter example I think of Cuba, a place i've been to. The majority of the population is black, very black with little Europeans or indigenous folks that I could see. The historical reasons are twofold: the Indians were wiped out and their DNA barely survive through admixture, and white landowners fled the country when the communist revolution happened. This is where we get a large segment of the ""Latinos por Trump"" people, and why American Cubans have little in common with Cubans on the island. You also massively underestimate the impact of racism and larger Eurocentric ideals, as culture implicitly teaches children that people who look a certain way (like them) do not go far in life. It's the reason that I, as a mestizo man who passes for white, still struggle with hating some of my indigenous features and my racial ambiguity. My lips and my nose point to a history that not a lot of Americans like to think about, which was the enslavement and cultural erasure of indigenous communities under New Spain. Genocides and hispancization even within the past century guarantee that I will never know which of my ancestors were black or indigenous.

Split the country into Group A and Group B. Make sure half the employees at any given location are in each group, accounting for those who have two employees in a single household. Register them all in a central system so there's consistency per household.

Send each household a letter confirming which group they're in, even make a unified checker available online that confirms which group you're in without any need for a login etc. Make it public information.

For two weeks, absolute lockdown of anyone in Group A. Not allowed to leave the house except for absolute emergency. They all get given priority booking for online shopping, contact numbers for help during that period, etc.

After two weeks, switch groups, but anyone who has developed symptoms must keep isolating for 10 days from symptoms start (as per govt guidelines).

Rinse and repeat for Group B.

Do this with enough advanced warning, say, four weeks after the letters and website go live, with.the obvious prep time for forming the groups etc.

Yes. This should be fairly obvious since northern peoples (now) often have higher genotypic IQ and higher quality environments.

&gt;I saw someone a few months ago talk about how europeans were smarter than africans because they were in a ""cold climate"" 

It's due to a multitude of evolutionary reasons. This isn't as simple as 1 cause. We know for example that the cold winters theory can't be the only cause since selection still impacts intelligence while CWT predicts selection has stopped.

&gt;I know that the difference in IQ between races nowadays is due to the environmental reasons

1. Piata din Romania, de orice tip, este restransa. In plus de asta, tu poti sa ai o idee solida de business dar ai nevoie de bani la inceput ca sa o pui pe picioare.

Da, stiu problema - de unde luam fonduri? Nu am decat un salariu lunar. Corect, este o problema semnificativa.

Dar din fericire traim in 2020. Iar pe langa fonduri europene (desi si acolo e o problema - pentru multe programe trebuie sa dai tu banii pana cand ii primesti inapoi nerambursabil), exista acces la piata de capital, seed investing, crowdfunding si alte optiuni posibile. 

Banca in Romania nu investeste - bancile romane fac bani cu statul, cu titluri de stat, si dau credite de consum. Lasa banca.

2. Multi antreprenori nu cunosc ideea de business plan. Cu aia se mananca un business la inceput. Ai nevoie de o structura de baza pentru a intelege ce vrei sa faci, la cine o prezinti, cum faci banii in piata... practic e codul companiei.

1: what do you mean with ‚Äútoo late‚Äù? For the running semester: yes. Our semesters go from oktober (or september, depending on the type of college) to the end of january, and from march to the end of june. You‚Äôll have to apply until a little before the semester starts (though it might defer for some special courses). 

2: the application process is completely online at the moment. As you don‚Äôt have a BSc from the university of vienna, you‚Äôll have to submit yours and have it accepted (that process will most likely be the same for other unis, too). 
English is usually enough, there should be no language requirements. 

3: for non EU, the uni vienna can cost up to ‚Ç¨750 per semester, but there are a lot of ways to either get down to ‚Ç¨360 (typical amount for foreign students) or maybe even to ‚Ç¨20 (paid by EU students as long as they are fast enough). With some exceptions, most Universities in Austria and Germany will be in that prize category, I think. But! Always be sure to check what is included: in vienna, you‚Äôll have to find your own housing (~‚Ç¨400 per month) and probably need a traffic pass (‚Ç¨150 per semester). Other unis might have some of that included already. 

4: We have a lot of english only degree programs, and even the ones that are not categorized as such have a LOT of english courses. Plus, most citizens have a really good english level as well. At some point, learning the language would probably be nice for you, but no starting requirement. 

5: as far as I know, you will be granted a student visa if you were accepted into a university program in the country. That should not lead to many complications (but be sure to check the webpage of the embassy). 

6: In one of my courses the teacher was from india as well, and in his opinion it was very helpful to do his masters in europe, as he felt it gave him bigger chances for a good PhD position. I guess it is good to meet many different people if you want to stay in academia, and studying indifferent countries heightens your chances to impress some important people.

&gt; Italy, 1944\. As the war takes its toll on Allied forces in Europe, a squadron of black pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen are finally given the chance to prove themselves in the sky - even as they battle discrimination on the ground. It's a tribute to the unsung heroes who rose above extraordinary challenges and ultimately soared into history.

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator reports that 40% of 133 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5\.2\/10\. The site's consensus reads\: ""Despite a worthy fact-based story and obvious good intentions, Red Tails suffers from one-dimensional characters, corny dialogue, and heaps of clich√©s.""

**321** (three to one) is a Eurorack Modular adapter that I designed following the Intellijel 1U panel size. The adapter lets you install 3U modules (4HP max) horizontally on the 1U row of you case. You can install one 4HP module or two 2HP modules or one 1HP and one 3HP module. Since there is no threaded strip or slide nuts underneath to secure the M3 screws, I use M3 hex nuts.¬†The adapter is **26HP** wide.

The panel is pcb with matte black solder mask. The exposed copper is coated using the ENIG-RoHS (Nickel and Gold) finish for extra durability and nice golden color.

I kept a couple for personal use but I have a few extra to sell (Europe only). They come with 4 x M3 black screws, 8 x transparent washers and 4 x M3 black hex nuts.

&gt;United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years, the populations of virtually all countries of Europe as well as Japan will face population decline and population ageing. The new challenges of declining and ageing populations will require comprehensive reassessments of many established policies and programmes, including those relating to international migration.

&gt;Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union). Replacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.

They aren't taking white people out of the US, all that plan is to use migration to shore up the population so it stays net constant or growing.

&gt;The US was also a country of European immigrants not 3rd world immigrants there's a difference. And its a big difference importing people who hate white people. Look at South Africa where whites are a minority they are being genocided.

O.o What are you saying the 'difference' is?

People of other races don't just hate white people you know. The violence in South Africa is because of policies that discriminated against non-white people (only whites could own farms, etc.). There is a lot less violence now than when that policy was still enacted.

&gt;My culture and heritage are not for sale for the sake of a few extra GDP points thats sick globalist talk.

No culture is being sold here, it's more like other cultures are being brought in for free. Also, some people think they shouldn't have kids because of climate etc. Typically these are people who are very educated and believe in trying to reduce the burden of people on the planet etc. As for why the US is then taking in immigrants from third world countries? Because the US needs the people and population exodus from other countries creates a supply to meet that demand. The US also doesn't control the population growth of other countries, so there isn't much pressure to put onto other countries on that aspect yet.

The US doesn't incentivize births (beyond what is done in health care, which isn't much) of a particular racial subset because that would be pretty messed up.

Many of the states released in the treaty of Brest-Livotsk are its puppets either *de jure* or *de facto.* It starts AuthDem in the beginning of the story, with an authoritarian regime over Belgium and an evil administration in Mittelafrika. 

On the other hand, Germany also plays a very important role as the defender of the status quo. As bitter as it might be to admit by the other nations, Germany is the leader of the Interwar world, and dozens of smaller economies depend on its own.

Consumer goods are produced at an all-time high as much of Germany's militarism has been quenched following the suffering at the hands of WW1. 

What's worse, there is no path that leads Germany to avoiding the inevitable confrontation with its two neighbours.

Germany, Russia, and the CoF all cannot be called the good guys because they all have huge flaws that send them tumbling down the path of war.

It would be impossible for nations in subsaharan African to conduct reliable tests, count deaths or even estimate excess deaths.

To get a more reliable picture, let‚Äôs compare the US to Europe excluding Russia. Europe would have 239000 deaths while the US would have 237000, which may still seem bad for the US considering Europe nearly has double the population but keep in mind that Europe isn‚Äôt a single entity, some nations did better than others. We can selectively choose countries worst hit by covid there any they would be much worse than the US. Europe also currently accelerating in terms of more cases and deaths, so those numbers are likely to shift worse to Europe.

What is the point of all of this? Stop comparing how some countries did to other countries performance. Try seeing if we could have done better in this current conditions.

No, you just copied the incorrect definition which pops up when you google communism. You'd have gotten a way more accurate definition if you'd just looked at Wikipedia. Communism is an ideology who's adherents want to establish a communist society which is one that has no money, not state and no classes.

&gt; See also Marxism ‚ÄòIn Eastern Europe it was abolished with the fall of communism and adoption of democracy.‚Äô

Communism was never established in Eastern Europe and democracy hasn't been adopted there.

&gt; The most familiar form of communism is that established by the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution of 1917,

The Bolsheviks didn't establish communism in Russia, that was never even their intention. They established state capitalism which Lenin believed was necessary to eventually establish communism, which is bollocks and the reason for that is very apparent with how the USSR liberalised the longer it went on.

&gt; and it has generally been understood in terms of the system practised by the former Soviet Union and its allies in eastern Europe, in China since 1949, and in some developing countries such as Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea.

Generally understood by people who don't understand communism, capitalism, socialism or anything about those countries.

&gt; In this form of communism it was held that the state would wither away after the overthrow of the capitalist system. In practice, however, the state grew to control all aspects of communist society. Communism in eastern Europe collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s against a background of failure to meet people's economic expectations, a shift to more democracy in political life, and increasing nationalism such as that which led to the break-up of the Soviet Union

Hey, some of what you said there was actually correct. Marxism-Leninism, what you would call communism despite it not being communist in the slightest, was the ideology they followed and it was profoundly anti-communist from its inception, which was by design. Stalin, the guy who ""founded"" this ideology based on an intentional misinterpretation of both Marx and Lenin, never wanted to impliment communism and just wanted to have a strong state that he was the head of. Actual Marxists along with Anarcho-Communists have been calling out the innate problems with this ideology since its inception because empowering the state and taking control from the workers is anti-Marxist and anti-communist.

&gt; Please tell me how Communism can be taken from theory to practice without humanity fucking it up?

Because it has been done successfully several times in the Paris Commune, the Ukranian Free Territory and Revolutionary Catalonia. These are the most notable examples, at least to me, of communism being enacted in modernity.

&gt; Would you be confident that if we were Communist and Trump was placed in power that we could trust the system to keep us from complete fascist dictatorship if things go as they did in the USSR?

People wouldn't be in power in communism, positions of power wouldn't exist on account of the state being gone. Things wouldn't go as they did in the USSR because a) I'm an anarcho-communist and I want the state to be dissolved right away and b) the USSR wasn't communist and no communist worth their salt would want to do anything they did, aside from the revolution bit.

&gt; I understand that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not real communism‚Äù but it was a great example of how the theory requires utopian conditions to succeed and can be that slippery slope into complete dictatorship when the government controls all things.

It was a good example of what happens when you let the state have unlimited power and how it needs to be dissolved right away.

Germany had a 3,500,000 standing army in 1914, Austro-Hungary had 3,000,000, Russia 6,000,000 and France with 4,000,000.

UK is expected to announce lock downs.  
Europe is locking down in many places.  
Canada is experiencing an upsurge.

All of those locations involve significant amounts of artists in the industry who will probably need to settle in to continue working from home for the next 6+ months at least.

Similarly, schools in those regions are more likely to be locked down that not, especially jurisdictions close down as hospitalisations ramp up.

They both were part of same military block, of course they were obliged to defend it.

&gt;German concern about Trump has very little to do with Trump pursuing  only American interests, it's about the crumbling of American democracy  and the western alliance and the effects of that on Europe and the rest  of the world.

You probably noticed that so called ""western alliance"" is very asymmetric. It's basically US defending the rest (with some minor exceptions).

What Trump is doing to Germany was basically same as what Germany was doing to Ukraine. He said, ""it's not our problem"".

When you say, you are concerned about what he will do to ""western alliance"", you are arguing with yourself, because as you said ""geopolitics isn't driven by emotion. This is a question of strategy. "".

It's just for some odd reason you believe that defending Germany is in US best interests, but not for example Ukraine. And Trump is simply disagreeing with you, he believes that defending both Germany and Ukraine is not in US interests.

And that's the point that you disagree with, not with the principle, but with the fact that he put Germany to same list as Ukraine, lol.

&gt;‚ÄúIf we consider the period 1989-2016 as a whole, average per adult national income has increased by 41% according to our benchmark estimates, i.e. at about 1.3% per year. As noted, the different income groups have enjoyed widely different growth experiences. The bottom 50% earners benefited from very small or negative growth, the middle 40% from positive but relatively modest growth, and the top 10% from very large growth rates (see Figure 4).‚Äù

&gt;https://voxeu.org/article/inequality-and-property-russia-1905-2016

&gt;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/620225/EPRS_ATA(2018)620225_EN.pdf

&gt;‚ÄúIn the Soviet Union, average income in the top 1% was only 4-5 times higher than that of society as a whole (since then, that ratio has risen to over 20).‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúMeanwhile, at the other end of society, ordinary Russians saw their savings wiped out by hyperinflation (between 1990 and 1996, prices rose nearly 5000 times). Salaries, often paid late or not at all, did not keep up, falling by 36% in real terms. The result was a catastrophic drop in living standards and a widening gap between rich and poor.‚Äù

&gt;	‚ÄúIn the seventeen years between 1992 and 2009, the Russian population declined by almost seven million people, or nearly 5 percent‚Äîa rate of loss unheard of in Europe since World War II. Moreover, much of this appears to be caused by rising mortality. By the mid-1990s, the average St. Petersburg man lived for seven fewer years than he did at the end of the Communist period; in Moscow, the dip was even greater, with death coming nearly eight years sooner.‚Äù

&gt;https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/09/02/dying-russians/

Similar dynamics are seen in Bulgaria:


&gt;Bulgarians remember a time not so long ago when they could rely on their health and education systems, and when their holidays were guaranteed,"" said political analyst Kolio Kolev of the Mediana Institute in Sofia. 
""Thirteen years after the fall of communism this is no longer the case, and Bulgarians have become angry, radical and unhappy with their lot,"" he added.

Poverty and economic insecurity exploded in most of Eastern Europe and the former USSR: 

&gt;	When Easterners made their first steps on the new road they had dreamed of for decades, they also met the first bumps. All of a sudden, people met with negative features of capitalism such as uncertainty, unemployment, and social polarization, which many did not like. I heard remarks such as, ‚ÄúEverything we were told about socialism was wrong but everything we were taught on capitalism was true.‚Äù The heroic Polish workers who revolted in 1956, 1970, 1976, and 1980, and who finally forced the regime to its knees with their uprisings, strikes, and organization, were, as Michnik noted, ‚Äúthe first who become the victims of the transformation‚Äù (1999). Many people lost their jobs and ended up peering into brightened shop windows with empty pockets. The workers of the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard, the cradle of resistance in Poland, declared no reason to celebrate at the anniversary celebration of the collapse of the regime they helped bring down, and they demonstrated against the transformation instead.

&gt;	At the time of the regime change in 1989, only a single homeless shelter existed in Budapest. Located on Dobozi Street, it had sixteen beds. In 1990, this situation dramatically changed. Most of the workers‚Äô hostels were closed down, and several big companies either slashed employment or closed down completely. Unemployment jumped from virtually zero to a double-digit figure. As a social worker put it in an interview, ‚Äúfrom one day to the next, 2,000 to 3,000 workers hostel places were closed in the capital.‚Äù Within a few years, 6,000 of the original 60,000 beds remained. Temporary workers from the countryside did not return to their villages but waited for work opportunities. The police force, which lost self-confidence under the new democratic rules and political environment, lost control as well. According to the calculations of social workers‚Äô organizations, between 10,000 and 15,000 people were thrown onto the streets. Beggars appeared, and homeless people slept on benches and in house entrances. More fright- eningly, according to official evaluations, about 300,000 people, roughly 15 percent of the population of Budapest, were at risk of becoming homeless, including those who rented beds or rooms and lived in unused shops and stores. All it would take was the loss of a job for them to become unable to afford basic shelter and be thrown out.

&gt;	On the other hand, social security, one of the advantages of state socialism, disappeared. Unemployment decimated the workforce, and people in their late fifties had tremendous difficulties finding jobs. The retirement age, which had been set at age 55 for women and 60 for men in most of the countries, began to rise. The Czech parliament introduced a gradual rise in the retirement age over the course of a decade: for men from 60 years to 62, and for women from 53‚Äì57 to 57‚Äì61. A gradual increase in the retirement age became a general pattern in the region, and reached a uniform 62 years in Hungary. Market prices immediately increased, and before governments were forced to cut expenditures, severe inflation eroded welfare subsidies built into the price of basic food products, children‚Äôs clothing, books, rents, entertainment, and transportation fees. The process was hastened by new regulations that replaced the old ones. 

&gt;	Poverty, according to UNICEF, became widespread. There are different ways to measure poverty. The World Bank used a poverty line of purchasing power parity of $4 per day ($120/month) per head. Using this index, in seven Central European countries, poverty increased from 3.3% to 25.5%, and in the three Baltic countries from 1% to 38%. In Lithuania, the decline into poverty was dramatic and reached nearly half of the population. In Estonia and Romania, this percentage was roughly 40 percent. During the first transformation years, 19 million people slipped into poverty in the region. A totally different definition of poverty is what is called relative poverty, which measures the layer of the population that earns less than 35% to 45% of the country‚Äôs average wage level. Between 1989 and the mid-1990s, people living below the relative poverty line increased in Czechoslovakia from 4% to 25%, in Hungary from 10% to 30%, in Poland from 25% to 44%, in Slovakia from 6% to 34%, in Bulgaria from 14% to 54%, in Romania from 34% to 52%, and in Croatia between 20% to 30% (figure 6.1). In Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, poverty had increased by the mid-1990s from 1% to 37%, 30%, and 22%, respectively. Children living in poverty reached 50% to 60% of the child population in the region (Milanovic, 1996: 93‚Äì94; UNICEF, 1994: 2).

Polling data shows that such sentiments are in fact widespread. If that‚Äôs not enough for you, communist parties actually won elections in Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, but I guess that‚Äôs fake, too? You are clueless and in fact very closed minded.

Communism turned most of Eastern Europe from a highly impoverished, economically backwards backwater to the most economically successful region on the planet: 

&gt;‚ÄúBetween 1913 and 1950, the Central and Eastern European countries comprised one of the slowest growing regions of the world. Their average 1 percent per capita GNP growth rate remained behind the growth of the advanced European ‚ÄúCore"" countries (1.3 percent), the non-¬≠European ‚ÄúCore"" countries (1.4 percent), Latin America (1.4 percent), and even Africa (1.2 percent)Õæ only Asia had slower growth (with its -0.1 percent). In contrast, between 1950 and 1973, Central and Eastern Europe could boast the best performance: its unprecedented 3.9 percent average annual per capita growth surpassed the growth rate of the European and non¬≠-European ‚ÄúCore"" (3.8 and 2.2 percent respectively), and was also better than the very rapid Asian (3.7 percent) and the less impressive Latin¬≠ American (2.5 percent) and African (1.7 percent) growth rates. According to these calculations, the region almost quadrupled its interwar rate of growth.‚Äù

Communism also eliminated food insecurity and saw the attainment similar variety in diet to the Western capitalist countries: 


&gt;‚ÄúFrom the more prosperous sixties on, the consumption of the typical foodstuffs of poor people, such as potatoes, decreased by one quarter in Poland, one fifth in Czechoslovakia, and dropped to a half in Hungary. Consumption of cereals declined by 20 percent in Hungary and Bulgaria, 33 percent in Poland, and by about 40 percent in Yugoslavia.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúPer capita meat, sugar, and egg consumption, an indication of high level nutrition, reached Western standards. The 7090 kg. meat consumption in Central and Eastern Europe was at the same level as in West Germany, Great Britain, and Denmark (74¬≠98 kg.) in the 1980s. The 40¬≠46 kg. of sugar consumption of the late eighties was rather similar to the West (36¬≠44 kg.). The annual 250 eggs consumed in West Germany was the same as the Czechoslovak and Hungarian level of the same year, but in the late eighties the latter region's standard reached 350 pieces. Fruit and vegetables were as often on the table in these countries as in the West. Bulgaria's per capita consumption was 223 kg., West Germany's level was 188 kg., Hungary consumed 155 kg., Denmark and the United States 122 kg. and 175 kg. respectively, Czechoslovakia's and Poland's fruit and vegetable consumption reached 128 kg. and 141 kg. respectively, the British level was 139 kg. in the 1980s.‚Äù",True,False,False,,,,0,1604287699,,1604289677,0,{},gav2oyl,False,t3_jmcynu,False,False,t1_gauwtq3,/r/DebateCommunism/comments/jmcynu/im_kinda_open_minded/gav2oyl/,False,,1615981921,10,True,False,DebateCommunism,t5_2vkao,r/DebateCommunism,public,,0,[],

But the COP I quoted is the heating seasonally adjusted value of a $4000 mini split, and it is far from a fantasy. It heats my home quite well.

I live North of you, where it is colder and my real COP varies from 5-6 in the shoulder season running at part load, to around 2.75 at -15f.  But it's rarely that cold.  Mean January temps in Chicago is around -5C, or 22 F. At those temps, a heat pump will definitely hit rated efficiency.

As gas gets more expensive over the next few years, when North America starts shipping it to China like crazy, heat pumps will become the dominate form of newly installed heating just like in Europe and Japan.

Anyways, back to the math, that still puts us at 19 kwh vs 28, so gas is still cheaper, but not 3x.  I also can't find gas for 25 cents a therm.  Must be a hell of a contract.  Cheapest I found was $.42 + 0.20

The blower argument isn't specious btw.  The COP includes the energy used by the blower in its calculation, but the energy efficiency of the furnace disregards it.  It adds up...

According to economist Gabriel Felbermayr, the decision to impose the lockdown nationwide has side effects. ""This makes the lockdown more expensive than it should be,"" says the head of the Institute for World Economics (IfW) in an interview with the Tagesspiegel. ""Germany is a big country. We have the advantages of federalism, but we don't use them in this situation,"" he says. ""It is not understandable that communities with very different infection rates are treated equally.
 
He would also like to see more explanations from politicians: ""Why, for example, are barbershops allowed to stay open, but gyms have to close? This is also incomprehensible. In principle, however, Felbermayr understands the need for a lockdown: ""There has to be the insight that we are in a dangerous situation. And you can achieve this with a lockdown.
 
Reimbursement for loss of sales is correct
 
The economist considers it right that entrepreneurs are now reimbursed for 75 percent of their lost sales. This is a better solution than the aid paid by the state in March. ""Back then, it was mainly the fixed costs such as rent or leasing installments that were replaced,"" says Felbermayr. ""Now, on the other hand, to a certain extent, you also have the entrepreneur's salary included. After all, managing directors would also have to live on something. However, he criticizes: ""Such a solution should have existed much earlier.
 
Biden has a balanced program
 
In the upcoming presidential election in the USA, Felbermayr hopes for a victory for Joe Biden. ""From a European point of view, of course, there is a lot in favor of Biden, simply because you can talk to him,"" he says. Especially since Biden has a balanced program. ""He wants to increase taxes, especially for the richer ones, but we don't assume that this would put too much of a strain on the economy. In addition, his goals overlapped in part with those of the EU. ""So Biden, like the EU, is aiming for a net zero emissions by 2050,"" says Felbermayr.

Regarding values and the treatment of women? Acceptance of others?  

Yeah. I don't think so.  

Islam out of all promotes what you see today on the media, hatred and killings, in the name of the advancement of their religion, revered heroes is what they become.  

All religions are fucked up but islam in particular is more of a cult cause that's how people are raised in it AND it promotes violence.  

Christianity at its heart promotes hate against gay people and so does judaism, they do address stoning and such, but they incite violence less than islam does.  

The biggest issue with islam is how literally they take the everything and how their raise their children.  

I am no fan of the pacifists either. They don't really read what they ""practice"". They're just fence setters and they'd join in the game once extremism grows or they are the majority.  

This is the problem EU will face many many years from now and it's already facing it in small numbers.  

What is considered islamophobia is just a simple concern over the well being of humanity and the world. Yeah. It bothers me to see all this fucked up shit and wonder how it'll all play out. Will the west be blinded by values that are inherently disrespected by these groups?

More like operation long shot, World beating test and trace system? Its a joke, won't sell the NHS? Refused to make that a law. Despite your thoughts on if those were good ideas in the first place, you have to admit it looks exceedingly questionable 

Secondly, I think the whole ""wanting to go through established systems thing"" is utter shite. I've looked at all the reasoning given and nowhere have I seen that. Its all ""its the parents responsibility"" and other reasons. I think they're just pulling at straws with that argument to try and cover for the fact it is them being arseholes plain and simple. 

Its such an odd hill to die on for the Tories. If you want to prove you're the party that cares, voting down a bill that'll make you look obviously heartless isn't really a good plan.

The irish lobby and the fact the US is the guarantor of the GF agreement means they aren't gonna bend over backwards for us.

Hylli is straight-up bad (he plays four champions, and hard feeds &gt;50% of games), and had a single good tournament after a year of looking like a D2 autofill. Vander *is* hilariously the third best Support in your region, and Kaiser was forgettable. Teams that want to compete which are not named Fnatic or G2 have to import Supports next split (Fnatic should import, they just won't). I expect Wadid to pick up a contract, I'm betting we see at least one LPL Support player (ppgod, maybe, if people buy into the hype), and I'd be amazed if we didn't see someone try to get Viper and LeHends as a duo lane. That would bring you up to around five competitive Supports, depending on how Wadid looks after a year mostly off. 

Thing is, you could literally import a mid-tier LCK mid-laner like Fly, teach them Support (and English) for a month, and have the second best Support in the region. Fly can already play Lux, Karma, Morgana, Lulu, Swain, and a half-dozen other non-tank Supports that your region cannot execute. [This is your second best Support player](https://gol.gg/players/player-stats/237/season-ALL/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/champion-ALL/), and he plays one Enchanter (Morgana) at an acceptable level. Come Season 11 he'll have a second one in Annie, maybe, if she doesn't get nerfed into the ground (she will get some nerfs, it just depends how severe they are).

The LPL and LCK are interesting to watch because players like Kiin warp games around them. Kiin is continually on rosters that are not viable. They cannot compete for the title. HE, however, is so good that he pulls Afreeca to 4th/5th nearly every split. It's interesting to watch Afreeca play DRX because Deft is not stable and Rascal gets demolished by Kiin, which gives Afreeca two openings. There is nothing compelling about a Fnatic versus Schalke game. If Fnatic loses, it's because [Hylisang](https://gol.gg/game/stats/24670/page-game/) and/or [Bwipo](https://gol.gg/game/stats/25855/page-game/) were even less stable than usual and gave over too much gold. It's not because someone on Schalke is actually a good enough player to solo carry games against top-tier talent (and, again, I don't consider Fnatic to be a top-tier team). Until you have players like Kiin on all your bottom-tier teams (and, theoretically in the same role), there is no reason to expand the league. 

I quit watching LEC because the results were obvious after three weeks of Spring. G2 &gt; Fnatic &gt; everyone else, and no one other than those two teams mattered. You didn't build a third competitive roster. I don't even count Fnatic, to be honest, but with enough substitutions I could kinda build a second roster from among all the EU teams. I can't come close to building three. You don't have enough good players to field even a third competitive team, let alone an ELEVENTH. The only thing that adding more teams does is dilute the data pool when we go to scrub for things like champion matchup statistics. Wunder winning a Renekton versus Ornn lane doesn't mean Renekton actually beats Ornn, or that he found some secret tech to flip the lane. It means Wunder is so much better than his opponent, he defied the matchup. He already does this to seven players in his region. We don't need him to do it twice more.

But it turns out that foreign firms already own a big slice of British fishing rights and will continue to do so permanently. 

Why? 

Because British companies sold their quotas. Spanish firms own 88 per cent of Welsh fishing rights and most of the quota from the Bristol Channel to the Scottish border.

Dutch and Icelandic firms control most of our East Coast fishing. European seas are split into sectors and governments hand out quotas specifying how much of each type of fish can be caught.

Tickets have been sold for each of the 61 fixtures across the men's, women's and wheelchair tournaments, starting on October 23, and RLWC2021 CEO Jon Dutton said postponing the World Cup would only be considered as a last resort.

Tournament organisers have done financial modelling for a socially distanced World Cup with attendances capped at 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent ground capacity, as well as for full stadiums and believe it remains viable under each scenario.

Officials are reluctant to postpone the tournament by 12 months as the FIFA World Cup is scheduled in 2022 and have also ruled out moving it from England as the UK Government has committed significant funding.

""We have been very clear that although we remain realistic about the significant challenges relating to the pandemic, particularly in England, our position remains unchanged,"" Dutton said.

""We are 12 months away from the tournament and remain confident that RLWC2021 will take place as planned next year.""

If the World Cup was postponed, it is likely that the Oceania Cup or a similar event would be held in Australia and/or New Zealand to ensure the game did not go without any international fixtures for two years.

However, no decision is expected until after winter in northern hemisphere and the fate of other major sporting events in England, such as the rescheduled European Championships next June and July, is known.

""We‚Äôre not aware of any discussions between the IRL or any other nations about alternative options and any significant decisions will be made by our board following consultation with our partners in the New Year,"" Dutton said.

Dutton told a media briefing before the UK Government announced a lockdown starting on Thursday until December 2 that fans would be guaranteed a full refund on pre-purchased tickets if the World Cup was impacted by COVID-19. 

""The period between January and March is going to be critical because the first thing we have to do is look at what the world looks like,"" he said.

""We have to be agile and adapt to the challenges that are out there, but obviously the ideal is for this to be delivered in front of full stadia.

""I still feel incredibly positive that the tournament will happen in a year‚Äôs time like we‚Äôre planning.

As for your question... Our system of care here in Europe is way different, so I can't immediately say that what I'd do in my situation is the same as I'd do in hers.
However, I would've done what she also did - go to someone else. If her daughter really had an irregular high pulse (something I cannot imagine you miss as a medical professional, and also cannot imagine they don't measure upon admittance to urgent care) and they ignored it, best thing to do is to take her daughter somewhere they don't do that. In virtually any country but America, where costs literally cost lives, there wouldn't be a barrier to getting the care you need. 

The thing is, there's bad doctors out there. We all know it. I'm just a little bit tired of a lot of people assuming that when they run into one of them, that's immediately proof that all doctors everywhere won't take them seriously. That in a situation like this, *no one* will listen, because *one* person didn't listen.

We don't know how this mother went into urgent care. We don't know what she said. We don't know if her daughter's ""high pulse"" was 90 or 200 beats per minute. Hell, I once had a patient come in to urgent (!) care with a headache that had already lasted 6 weeks. I'm willing to bet that patient also said we denied her care, fully ignoring how she said herself that it wasn't urgent (at an urgent care facility) but she was ""suddenly scared it was cancer"". In the same vein, we don't know what that doctor said, only how OP took it.

And that's okay, because care is meant to be human. If OP didn't feel helped, that's a valid experience and it deserves attention. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's *wrong*.

**Die Geoblocking-Verordnung (EU) 2018/302 kn√ºpft an die Dienstleistungsrichtlinie 2006/123/EG an. Sie verbietet allen, die Dienstleistungen erbringen, z. B. Handwerkern, ihre Kunden aufgrund der Staatsangeh√∂rigkeit oder des Wohnsitzes zu diskriminieren. Die Geoblocking-Verordnung weitet diese Regelung explizit auf den Online-Handel aus.** 

**Unternehmer d√ºrfen selbst entscheiden, in welche L√§nder sie liefern und in welche nicht. Falls aber ein Kunde aus einem EU-Land bestellen m√∂chte, in das der H√§ndler normalerweise nicht liefert, muss ihm dennoch die M√∂glichkeit einger√§umt werden, eine Bestellung aufzugeben.** Und zwar zu den selben Liefer- und AbholopWEITERLEITUNG, SPERRUNG, BEGRENZUNG DES ZUGANGS KURZ UND KNAPP Anbietern ist es grunds√§tzlich nicht erlaubt, den Zugang zu ihrer Internetseite aufgrund der Staatsangeh√∂rigkeit, des Wohn- oder Firmensitzes des Kunden zu sperren oder zu beschr√§nken. Ausnahmen 1. Die Weiterleitung ist nach Europ√§ischem Recht oder nationalem Recht erforderlich. So kann beispielsweise ein H√§ndler, der Feuerwerksk√∂rper verkauft, den Zugang zu seiner Internetseite f√ºr Kunden eines Landes blockieren, in das keine Feuerwerksk√∂rper aus einem anderen Land eingef√ºhrt werden d√ºrfen. 2. Der Kunde hat ausdr√ºcklich seine Zustimmung zur Weiterleitung auf eine andere Internetseite gegeben. Er wurde z. B. in einem Fenster auf der Seite gefragt, ob er weitergeleitet werden m√∂chte. Der Kunde hat dann das K√§stchen ‚Äûja‚Äú angeklickt. Res√ºmee tionen wie sie einem Kunden in einem Land angeboten werden, in das der H√§ndler liefert. **Der Kunde hat dann zwei M√∂glichkeiten: ‚Äì Er l√§sst sich die Ware an eine Adresse liefern, die in einem EU-Mitgliedstaat liegt, f√ºr den der H√§ndler in seinen AGB die Lieferung anbietet. Dann muss der Kunde in der Konsequenz die Ware dort abholen oder den Weitertransport nach Hause selbst organisieren**. oder er holt die Ware an einem zwischen ihm und dem H√§ndler vereinbarten Lieferort ab. Dieser liegt in einem EU-Mitgliedstaat, f√ºr den der H√§ndler in seinen AGB die Abholung anbietet. (Art. 4)

No, this is like city announcing it is changing certain area into no-parking zone and you not wanting to move your car. This change was known well in advance, even the box says ""Facebook account needed"". Your failure to pay attention is not fault of Facebook.

&gt;Nope in every single way if you‚Äôre banned you must still have access to your purchases by EU law. The fact that you don‚Äôt anymore or can‚Äôt use the device anymore as originally intended is a clear violation of that. Especially since we didn‚Äôt agree to those terms at time of purchase. 

Then take Steam to court too, since they have exact same policy. Should your account get suspended you lose access to all games on it, even ones you purchased elsewhere.

&gt;A lot of us did not agree to any facebook integration or their TOS at the time of purchase. This is why its being investigated in the EU. And A LOT of people here wouldn‚Äôt have bought one if they knew in advance. 

Companies generally reserve right to change TOS whenever they want, in case you ahve missed. And Facebook integration with Quest 2 was known *months* in advance to release of Quest 2, you really have no excuse to not know about it.

We already know Quest 2 has been jailbroken, but we no easy-to-use tools yet.

&gt;And you also couldn‚Äôt be further off the mark, its pretty fucking illegal to make a device useless in the EU because you were banned. You can deny online access or access to your platform, but the device you payed for MUST still work. 

It's not, since the device itself is not useless. You are still allowed to jailbreak it, you just lose access to the operating system and store. Just like Microsoft is allowed to close your Windows installation, rendering the computer ""useless"". Or Google is allowed to block your access to Play Store and it's content, making the phone ""useless"".

&gt;Add to that that Steam bans only partial access like social features or online access to a specific game and none of what you say holds water.

Nope, you are thinking of VAC Bans/Game Bans. I am talking about Account Suspensions. Those fully close down your account. See my edited posts, since the one who I originally was going to respond removed their post.

&gt;Do you jnow if this is anything like the flu? Flu has a different strain of virus every season doesnt ut?

Flu naturally has multiple strains and it's genome has 8 major parts and the virus can swap it with other strains to create a new strain. However even here the vaccines developed against the various strains have shown a good amount of longetivity (Eg: H1N1 vaccine has basically been the same since 2009). The challenge with flu is identifying which strain to produce the vaccines for - every year manufacturers have to choose 2-3 strains for which they vaccinate. If they make a mistake it usually turns out to be a bad year in terms of flu deaths.

The worry for coronavirus mutating to escape the vaccine is a little alarmist since it is much more stable due to error correction. Another advantage of our immune system is we develop many many antibodies - lab experiments have shown multiple anti-bodies can prevent immune escape that is sometimes seen in single antibody response.

[Antibody cocktail to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevents rapid mutational escape seen with individual antibodies ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540904/)

&gt; Antibodies targeting the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present a promising approach to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, concerns remain that mutations can yield antibody resistance

&gt; We investigated the development of resistance against four antibodies to the spike protein that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, individually as well as when combined into cocktails. These antibodies remain effective against spike variants that have arisen in the human population.

&gt; However, novel spike mutants rapidly appeared after in vitro passaging in the presence of individual antibodies, resulting in loss of neutralization; such escape also occurred with combinations of antibodies binding diverse but overlapping regions of the spike protein.

&gt; Escape mutants were not generated after treatment with a noncompeting antibody cocktail.

\-I do regularly have space left in the KS50, so it might be worth looking into getting a smaller pack.  


\-Thank you for the advice on the fleece. I put the Peloton 97 Fleece Zip-T Hoodie on the ¬¥wishlist¬¥ because I¬¥ve read that its a nice material to sleep in. Do you have experience with the OMM Core Hoodie, and if so, is the material nice enough as a sleeping layer?  


\-Thank you for the advice regarding the rain jacket. I¬¥ve been trying to find the Norrona Bitihorn Shakedry GTX, however after contacting them I found out that they dont make it anymore. Getting a shakedry jacket seems difficult in Scandinavia/Europe so far, but ill keep looking.  


\- Your¬¥e lighterpack really helps to look at.

Sure I spent my teenage years in a poor part of England being called ""sheep shagger"" and other abusive terms by English people, and yeah the town was full of racist people, but it's hardly their fault they've been abandoned by their government and are poorly educated. 

That's what I used to tell myself anyway. 

I moved to London and love it here. Everyone is so open and welcoming, I moved after the 2012 Olympics so obviously didn't experience all that, but this open Britain where we had a sense of in it togetherness etc seemed real and what I loved about being British. 

More and more though I became to just realise that as great as London is, it's the exception rather than the rule. Most of England is the xenophobic, small minded towns and cities long abandoned by their government which they keep voting for in a weird sort of abusive relationship. 

This combined with how the Tories have increasingly been treating the Welsh Government as a total after thought, the fact that English people keep treating Wales as an extension of their back garden to dip into and spread covid to, and the fact that Scotland is almost certainly going to leave has just lead me more and more to being open to Welsh independence. 

It would be tough and it would mean totally overhauling the Welsh economy, but I don't see much prospect for things getting better under increasingly English dominated governments being voted for by a country where the population is increasingly xenophobic, small minded, and poorly educated.

Europeans have something called the ""hate for Russians""  
Reason being? When they see cryllic text they assume they are Russian and most Russian players spam texts no one can read, tend to play horribly and some other things that ruins the game. This a stereotype of a Russian player, but since the concentration of cryllic writing players being bad, annoying, toxic and such... most will get annoyed the moment they see it.

Now luckily we won't say stuff like: ""Commie pig"" or ""You live in povety"", but more or less we make slight passive aggresive remarks to them. Not nice.

I have expirenced Bronze a few times, but I can safely say in EU, most Bronze aren't fucking garbage humans. So this seems like a US server issue.. and I do believe US players have HEAVY RACISM PROBLEMS. I do remember in online games that Brazilians tended to be targeted for similiar reasons EU players target Russians. ""Rude, do not want to cooperate, only speaks their own language to a point of flooding the text and tend to be toxic towards others.""

Eitherway... how do we fix this? You don't.. These people are simply unavoidable. No matter what we do... there is no main consiquence to their acts. 

We ban them.. they make a smurf and go back in. 

You put in an auto filter... normal players will suffer from it in communication

You try to take their rank points, they are already ROCK BOTTOM!

So.. what is the true fix? Well reward good behaviour.. insted of punishing, reward good behaviour. Insted of: ""You can just play the game if you are nice.""

[],,Chocolaty_Kiki,,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ez5h0dk,False,False,[],"Olha, esse tipo de pensamento √© bem comum atualmente e bem perigoso

1- Primeiro, a forma como fala d√° a entender que voc√™ quer s√≥ a estabilidade. Voc√™ n√£o parece possuir um interesse pessoal em determinada √°rea o suficiente pra querer estudar ela.

2- Faculdade n√£o √© t√£o objetivo assim. √â normal a pessoa decidir mudar de curso/√°rea durante a gradua√ß√£o. Ou at√© mesmo ir fazendo meio sem saber o que realmente quer e s√≥ depois escolher uma √°rea pra se especializar.

3- Talvez, no seu caso, fosse melhor escolher um curso t√©cnico (muitos s√£o curtos, gratuitos e com v√°√°√°√°rias √°reas de atua√ß√£o), fazer e a partir da√≠ ir vendo o que te desperta interesse.

4- Ent√£o....o nosso pa√≠s sofre de um s√©rio ""d√©ficit de m√£o de obra"" especializada. Tem muita vaga de emprego, mas s√£o pra √°reas mais altas e espec√≠ficas e complexas.
Significa que n√£o h√° pessoas qualificadas para ocupar aquele cargo, ent√£o ele fica vazio por meses ou anos inclusive.

5- √â chato dizer isso, mas.....j√° parou pra pensar que o zezinho que tem diploma, bem....ele simplesmente seja um profissional ruim na √°rea que ele atua?
Ter diploma n√£o significa que seja bom no que ele fez, nem significa que ele v√° se especializar numa √°rea. Nem significa que ele estudou realmente.

6- Felizmente, as pol√≠ticas de trabalho nos √∫ltimos anos colocaram muuuita gente na Universidade. Mas se for ver de uma forma geral, √© o ""m√≠nimo da obriga√ß√£o"" na educa√ß√£o.
√â como o ingl√™s. Hoje em dia, n√£o √© visto mais como um diferencial, mas como o m√≠nimo que se espera. O diferencial atual mesmo √© ser tril√≠ngue (justamente por conta da competitividade, o patamar m√≠nimo t√° elevado)

7- Outro equ√≠voco bem comum que vejo: pessoal acha que bandido n√£o precisa estudar. Hahaha
Sim, √© meio esquisito isso, mas deixa eu explicar: at√© pra ser um bandido foda hoje em dia, TEM que estudar.
Dependendo da √°rea de ""atua√ß√£o em criminalidade"" que for atuar, vai precisar estudar T.I., at√© engenharia reversa se for aplicar golpes, ou ser muito bom em contabilidade pra aplicar fraudes em m√©dia e grande escala, log√≠stica pra fazer a distribui√ß√£o de drogas ou trabalhar com carga roubada etc. Pra roubar t√° mais dif√≠cil, e o cara tem que t√° preparado.
Pra voc√™ ter no√ß√£o, no in√≠cio da pandemia, tinha golpista que aplicava golpe do bilhete premiado (precisa ser presencial pra ser aplicado) tava reclamando que n√£o conseguia ""trabalhar"" a semanas porque os idosos em especial tinham sumido das ruas e as transa√ß√µes tavam sendo feitas online!
C√™ imagina s√≥: o cara era um golpista que n√£o estudou, n√£o tentou mudar a estrat√©gia e ficou obsoleto. E como ele s√≥ conhece golpes do tipo, t√° passando fome!
A√≠ quem se reinventou e foi pros golpes digitais na pandemia t√° rachando de ganhar dinheiro hahahaha
Eu acho fascinante essa necessidade de se adaptar ao mercado!

8- ""Concurseiro"" n√£o √© mais carreira...
Antigamente, realmente tinha gente que passava at√© 5, 10 anos se dedicando pra passar.
Gente, isso n√£o existe mais. At√© pra ser concurseiro a m√©dia caiu pra uns 2,5/3 anos.
N√£o sei se acompanha coisa de concurseiro e tals, mas at√© o m√©todo deles mudou.
Tem o Fernando Mesquita, daqui de Bras√≠lia, por exemplo que ele fala muito sobre isso.
E que fazer concurso sem faculdade √© coisa que t√° morrendo (vide a quest√£o do estado-minimo que foi citado no t√≥pico).

9- T√° cada dia mais competitivo. O que n√£o significa uma coisa ruim.
E sempre se precisa elevar o patamar m√≠nimo pra diferenciar o joio do trigo.

10- N√£o espere a faculdade pra estudar. Faculdade e estudo hoje s√£o coisas diferentes.
Faculdade vai ter dar um norte pra onde e o qu√™ estudar, mas vai n√£o vai conseguir ver tudo l√° dentro. Vai ter que correr e estudar coisas por fora, especialmente se for afunilar. Faculdade √© a base.....base m√≠nima. Voc√™ mesmo que vai ter que afunilar seus estudos.

Enfim, espero que fique bem e que possa refletir com mais carinho sobre sua decis√£o. Te desejo boa sorte e espero que encontre algo que te desperte o interesse!

Legend books are also available for 44.99 USD per pack which is the cheapest it's ever been, but that's also $45 that you could be spending on other things.

If you only got into this game a week ago, I'd say play it for a bit more and see how you feel. I think you may enjoy the PvE content (which gives a massive load of goodies). If you like it from there, buy some Lulu deals whenever they have diamonds or the occasional flash deals.

Aims

The risk of mortality from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is increased by comorbidity from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Air pollution also causes excess mortality from these conditions. Analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outcomes in 2003, and preliminary investigations of those for SARS-CoV-2 since 2019, provide evidence that the incidence and severity are related to ambient air pollution. We estimated the fraction of COVID-19 mortality that is attributable to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution.
Methods and results

We characterized global exposure to fine particulates based on satellite data, and calculated the anthropogenic fraction with an atmospheric chemistry model. The degree to which air pollution influences COVID-19 mortality was derived from epidemiological data in the USA and China. We estimate that particulate air pollution contributed ‚àº15% (95% confidence interval 7‚Äì33%) to COVID-19 mortality worldwide, 27% (13 ‚Äì 46%) in East Asia, 19% (8‚Äì41%) in Europe, and 17% (6‚Äì39%) in North America. Globally, ‚àº50‚Äì60% of the attributable, anthropogenic fraction is related to fossil fuel use, up to 70‚Äì80% in Europe, West Asia, and North America.
Conclusion

Our results suggest that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604320695,,False,0,{},gaw2jgy,False,t3_jmaao1,False,False,t3_jmaao1,/r/COVID19/comments/jmaao1/regional_and_global_contributions_of_air/gaw2jgy/,False,,1615998908,1,True,False,COVID19,t5_2f4l19,r/COVID19,public,,0,[],

Bravo. I could stop there, but fuck it.

your talking about a one page summary of a CIA report. The full thing is here

. Now for starters, some important things. This CIA report is not looking at what Soviet citizens ingest, it is about food supply. This is very important. Secondly, even within this report you can see there are some huge inequalities across the Soviet Union. Meat consumption in Estonia was 81kg per capita per year, in Uzbekistan it was 31kg. Fruit consumption had an average of 40kg per person per year, but across Siberia it was 12kg.

The report indicates that the Soviets had slightly lower calorie in take than America. This understates things considerably.

Firstly, Soviet citizens conducted vastly more strenuous work in a significantly colder climate. They did not have the luxury of things like personal cars, or working 9-5 jobs in comfortable offices. The total recommended daily amount of calories

for a Soviet person ranged from 2,800 to 3,600 for men and from 2,400 to 3,100 for women, depending on their occupation. In the United States, estimates range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for adult men. So right away, it is very important to remember that the Soviets need higher calories than Americans.

Adding to this, the Soviet Union was notoriously ineffective at getting food into its citizens. The Soviet Union was the world's largest milk producer, but only 60% of that actually ended up in people. In the United States, 90% of milk produced was consumed by humans. General Secretary Gorbachev noted that reducing field and farm product losses during harvest, transportation, storage and processing could increase food consumption in general by 20%. So any of those figures you see in CIA reports, you can basically take down by one-fifth.

If you read this dissertation you get some useful points:

per capita consumption figures likely overstate actually available amounts, given that the Soviet Union‚Äôs inadequate transportation and storage infrastructure led to frequent shortages in stores, as well as significant loss of foodstuffs and raw products due to spoilage... In 1988, at the height of perestroika, it was revealed that Soviet authorities had been inflating meat consumption statistics; it moreover transpired that there existed considerable inequalities in meat consumption, with the intake of the poorest socioeconomic strata actually declining by over 30 percent since 1970... Government experts estimated that the elimination of waste and spoilage in the production, storage, and distribution of food could have increased the availability of grain by 25 percent, of fruits and vegetables by 40 percent, and of meat products by 15 percent.

Despite subsidising food by something like 10% of GDP food was still more expensive than in the West

If you actually read about the daily life in the USSR  you will find assessment such as ""The prevailing system of food distribution is clearly a major source of dissatisfaction for essentially all income classes, even the best off and even the most privileged of these."" As you love CIA reports, here is another one which warns against the sunny outlook in the Wester literature:

In summary, I went to the USSR with a set of notions about what to expect that I had formed over the years from reading and research on the Soviet economy. I also had a collection of judgment factors,partly intuitive and partly derived from this same research and reading, that I applied in drawing conclusions and speculating about probable future developments in the Soviet economy. My four months of living in the country itself, however, greatly altered these preconceptions and modified the implicit judgment factors in many respects. No amount of reading about the Soviet economy in Washington could substitute for the summer in Moscow as I spent it. As a result of this experience I think that our measurements of the position of Soviet consumers in relation to those of the United States (and Western Europe) favor the USSR to a much greater extent than I had thought. The ruble-dollar ratios are far too low for most consumer goods. Cabbages are not cabbages in both countries. The cotton dress worn by the average Soviet woman is not equivalent to the cheapest one in a Sears catalogue; the latter is of better quality and more stylish. The arbitrary 20 percent adjustment that was made in some of the ratios is clearly too little. The difference in variety and assortment of goods available in the two countries is enormous‚Äîfar greater than I had thought. Queues and spot shortages were far more in evidence than I expected. Shoddy goods were shoddier. And I obtained a totally new impression of the behavior of ordinary Soviet people toward one another. One of the true experts on consumption and nutrition in the USSR is Igor Birman who wrote the book on this topic. You get some interesting stats, like the USSR consume 229% the amount of potatoes as the United States but 39% the amount of meat. He also shows that the Soviets were not hitting their own ""Rational Norms"" for the consumption of meat, milk milk products, eggs, vegetables, fruits or berries. For example, while the Soviet Rational Norm for for fruit was 113kg, the actual consumption was 38. The US actual was smack bang on 113kg. You get some other fun facts like potato consumption in Tsarist Russia, 1913 was 113kg and after all of Stalin's industrialisation and collectivisation and decades of development, this increased to... 119kg in 1976 Just an extra study I've found: In areas of the Soviet Union, 93% of men were Vitamin C deficient while in neighbouring Finland this was 2%.",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,,1,1604320775,,False,0,{},gaw2n48,False,t3_jmdty9,False,True,t1_gav2ocx,/r/teenagers/comments/jmdty9/for_all_my_communist_homies_out_there/gaw2n48/,False,,1615998952,-6,True,False,teenagers,t5_2rjli,r/teenagers,public,,0,[],

All the other interval names are literally ordinal number, in Italian (so if you know intervals in that language you also know ordinals, and vice versa).

Since Italy was among the most influential countries where western music was developed in the past, I assume that the names sticked, and were translated into several other languages.

Hence the translation ""prime"" in English... which might have a slightly different meaning, but it's a calque from the Italian.

I can't speak for the entirety of the continent, but we learned about the US as a whole. In terms of political geography, we learn it's made up of 50 states, one colony and few territories and that's it. The focus is on economic, demographic and physical geography.

One is that the UK is a victor of WWII, and while I think that ""History is written by the winners"" is a lame oversimplification, it holds some truth. Another important difference is that colonialism and human atrocities are part of British history, but just that - part, not the entirety.

Nazi Germany, on the other hand, only existed for just over twelve years. For half its existence, it fought the most destructive war humanity has ever seen. This war, and the Holocaust tied to it, aren't just some thing among things that the Nazis did, it was their endgame. Extermination of all Jews are there from day one on, and so was world domination (or at least domination of Europe and becoming the world's most powerful nation, even if that was a fantasy).

That said, I feel this question may well be better answered by those over in r/linguistics, unless there are any historians in the sub who specialise in language history. 

Essentially, the short answer is no, not at all, but this myth seems ever-present for whatever reason, so there's no shame in being lead to believe such a thing. The long answer is of course a little more complex, but still a firm no. Before even getting into any history, one has to understand that there is no ""original"" accent for British English, in much the same way as there is no standard accent for everyone who lives in North America. Accents can often change over here from one town to the next, as well as each individual having their own affectations that affect their speech. 

As well as this, language and accents change over time, as your question suggests, but this fact is true both in the UK and in the US/CA. When settlers from the UK and Europe left for America, they took with them whatever accent they held at the time. Often, you will find that groups of people from areas of the UK will have made the crossing at the same time, choosing to stick together once in America to start their new lives, as well as successive journeys made by friends/relatives to join them at a later date. This may have caused the basis for a particular area of America being lingustically distinct from another area, but one also has to consider that not all immigrants to NA were from the UK, and as such, linguistic quirks may have come about as a result of this mixing of cultures. 

Once settled, accents in a given area will have begun to homogonise, as an area solidifies its identity, but then these accents will have developed in their own way, much in the same way as ""back home"" in the UK, changing into something altogether different to whatever accent they held when the original settlers arrived. Whilst an accent may hold some similarities with accents from back in the UK (such as some southern US accents having a striking similarity to some west country dialects), the hundreds of years that have passed between the settling of the Americas by British settlers and now, means that dialects and accents have had plenty of time to change on their own. 

In short, just because settlers will have been isolsted from much UK linguistic influence does not mean that their accents simply stagnated and remained ""pure"". Differing accents will have merged with one another, or perhaps fell out of favour altogether in favour of another more prominent one, and all of these accents will have seen some level of change since the settling of NA by Europeans.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604321900,,False,0,{},gaw43pu,False,t3_jmhbw3,False,False,t3_jmhbw3,/r/AskHistorians/comments/jmhbw3/is_the_north_american_accent_really_the_original/gaw43pu/,False,,1615999639,27,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,,0,[],

Start with 1 cucumber, 7 apples, 500g macaroni, 1 loaf of bread, 1kg of oats, 250g cheese (cheapest you can fine, but make sure it‚Äôs real, not artificial), 5 onions, 5 big carrots, 500g doctor sausage, butter for butter bread, 10 eggs (if they are expensive, get less), and most importantly, at least 10 potatoes.

I‚Äôm not sure how much it would cost in Russia, but it‚Äôs about 12 ‚Ç¨ in most of Eastern Europe for all of these.

For first meal: take about 100ml/50g oat flakes, and boil with 250ml water. Maybe add some salt/sugar so you are less miserable eating this 5 times a week. This will keep your stomach happy for about 4 hours. You can add some butter, or jam (if you have it), for flavor, but be careful to not use so much.

Always remember to never combine more than 3 ingredients that you have. 

Meal idea 2
Butter, bread, and egg

Those are two breakfast ideas

Lunch idea 
Butter, bread, some cheese, doctor sausage, boom.

Remember those seven apples you bought? There are seven for a reason. Eat one everyday with lunch. It will keep you full until dinner time.


Dinner time. Remember, idea is to live, not impress friends and family.
Make macaron, add salt
Take soft macaron, throw to pan, make hard again. 
Trick brain into thinking you eat different thing everyday.
Add egg and cheese to pan with macaron, add some seasoning

Make too much? Save til next day. But eat next day, or it will taste like feet.

Dinner idea number two.
Take orange stick (carrot), lower dirt content of orange stick (remove skin), cut to small shapes, take sausage, cut to shape you need
Boil more macaroni.
Fry carrot and sausage before adding macaron

Next idea
Cut potato into small pieces 
Fry potato in low heat
When potato is soft, add some doctor sausage.
Then add egg. Now you have Three components.


Idea 4
Save for end of week, celebratory meal for surviving
Add potato, carrot, onion, doctor sausage, cheese, and egg to pan (all cut to pieces, of course)
Boom.

These are basic recipes that will help you survive, and give all nutrition you need

Fantastic work by Amtoj - woke up today to email notification that the petition had been submitted!  Apologies on the length below, wanted to bring the full community of r/CANZUK contributors together for quick democratic discussion on the presentation of the pending petition.

I would like to propose to the group of supporters above, as well as the contributors to r/CANZUK, that we make some updates to the petition currently pending, and follow the below initial outline a little more closely.

&gt;The contents of the petition could probably be kept to CANZUK at its most basic to not scare off whoever might be writing up the government response.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe there can be a mention of greater security cooperation, but no more than that to avoid this looking like a request for a political union.

**The proposed and pending Canadian petition received this morning is as follows -**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whereas:  
&gt;  
&gt;Canada has found itself without a reliable ally due to an isolationist United States;  
&gt;  
&gt;The United Kingdom is experiencing a similar kind of loneliness after leaving the European Union;  
&gt;  
&gt;Australia and New Zealand are in need of stronger partners due to Chinese aggression in their region;  
&gt;  
&gt;None of these nations can muster effective support from others in matters of security and trade like groups such as the EU, ASEAN, and Mercosur;  
&gt;  
&gt;This has led to situations such as the US placing unfair tariffs on Canada and Chinese attempts to economically sanction Australia;  
&gt;  
&gt;All four Commonwealth nations enjoyed a special relationship until the UK joined the European Community in 1973;  
&gt;  
&gt;Only Australia and New Zealand continue that relationship themselves through free movement and a mutual recognition of professional qualifications  
&gt;  
&gt;An opportunity for a new relationship between these four nations has been presented by Brexit but the Government of Canada is currently not acting on it;  
&gt;  
&gt;This is despite widespread support seen in an online petition by CANZUK International that has over 300,000 signatures to date; and  
&gt;  
&gt;Inaction may lead to future struggles in navigating through ongoing shifts in the global balance of power.  
&gt;  
&gt;We, the undersigned, **citizens and residents of Canada**, call upon the Government of Canada to negotiate with counterparts in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom to form a new CANZUK alliance with benefits similar to those found in the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. Canada must build on the strong bonds with its foremost Commonwealth partners to present its people with new economic opportunities and ensure the values of the nation remain upheld globally.

Loving the last paragraph, and I support the emphasis on the positive relationship between Australia and New Zealand. Great job noting the introduction of Brexit and how this grounds the initiative as a real opportunity for positive change.

I do not believe that it is for the good of the movement to include the initial 5 points, as they use emotional and aggressive language which holds the potential to polarize would be supporters,  as well as aggravate international relations with countries outside of CANZUK. (Should be avoiding terms like 'without an ally due to isolationist United States', 'Chinese aggression', 'experiencing a similar kind of loneliness'.) Avoidance of these in **international level bipartisan politics** (which we are hoping this will spur) is crucial in the success of this petition. An example would be the currently successful UK petition, which avoids any finger pointing at other international countries, and instead strives to focus on the ideals of the movement as a group focal point.

It is my suggestion that we change the petition before final signatures are submitted, to very closely mirror the existing petitions by CANZUK International or that submitted to the UK Government and Parliament - thereby emphasizing both clarity of idea and unity within the supporters of the CANZUK community internationally. Both of those petitions listed below.

Fleyfel explique aussi son hypoth√®se concernent la rapidit√© pour l'administration Trump de reconna√Ætre J√©rusalem comme capitale d'Isra√´l, li√© √† ce mouvement. 

La o√π par contre il semble avoir un angle mort, c'est sa lecture des √©v√®nements aux √âtats-Unis.

""This trend toward Trump is driven overwhelmingly by men. The gender gap among nonwhite voters is wider today than it was in 2016, with Black and Hispanic men supporting the president at higher rates than four years ago. In interviews on the subject, several of these men express admiration for Trump‚Äôs performance of masculinity ‚Äî namely his assertiveness, his refusal to be apologetic, his flouting of health and safety protocols amid the coronavirus pandemic, and his association with wealth, which in decades past has made him a pop culture reference point from hip-hop to Gilmore Girls.

""For men of all racial backgrounds who‚Äôve bought into the ideal the president embodies ‚Äî a rich businessman who isn‚Äôt accountable to anyone but himself ‚Äî his appeal might have been predicted. It also illustrates trends that have characterized the past several decades in politics, not just in the U.S. but globally. As my colleague Eric Levitz writes, male voters in the U.S. and Europe in particular have been trending more conservative and women more liberal since the late 1970s. The wrinkle for Black male voters is that their longtime loyalty to one party, the Democrats, has failed to meaningfully reduce racial inequality, and in the case of Biden, played a central role in devising a criminal-legal system that routinely abuses them. The resulting disaffection has led to a sense of political ‚Äúhomelessness,‚Äù as the Associated Press‚Äôs Aaron Morrison reports ‚Äî a recognition that neither party is a consistent ally, manifesting at times as a kind of mercenary relativism. As a result, Trump has narrowed the support gap and racked up Black male celebrity supporters. Kanye West and Lil Wayne have offered cosigns; Ice Cube is not a supporter, but advised Trump on his Platinum Plan for Black America, which drew elements from Cube‚Äôs business-focused Contract with Black America.

""At this point, we‚Äôre still talking minor shifts in the grand scheme. Black men overall are still backing Biden at rates nearing 80 percent, and if Trump wins, it will be primarily because a coalition of white voters wished it so. The GOP stands to remain committed to the interests of its white constituents, first and foremost, for the foreseeable future. But it seems significant that a Black and Hispanic male shift toward the GOP is occurring during the presidency of a bigot who derides women he doesn‚Äôt like as stupid or ugly, boasts about sexually assaulting them, and has described his own daughter as a ‚Äúpiece of ass‚Äù whom he would date if they weren‚Äôt related ‚Äî and that this shift has been observed most clearly among the youngest generations of voters. The same can be said of the GOP‚Äôs stance on issues like abortion ‚Äî a battle for legal control over women‚Äôs bodily autonomy waged by an overwhelmingly male cohort of elected officials. Declining loyalty among Black men toward Democrats seems likely to open the door to similar appeals in the years to come. In an unequal society marked by social and economic hypercompetition, it stands to reason that offering vessels for men to perform their power ‚Äî including by subjugating women ‚Äî would be appealing across racial lines.""

I‚Äôm sure others here could offer better advice, but maybe this can help.

* It helps to have all-wheel drive, only because of the combination of hills and snow/ice.  (Ithaca, the surrounding towns, and NYS do a decent job with plowing and salting, but you might be on the roads before the plows and salting trucks are out.). That‚Äôs one reason why you see so many Subarus here ‚Äî same thing in the New England states and Colorado.

* if you don‚Äôt get a car with AWD, get snow tires, if you have space to store your normal all-season tires.  If your car has regular non-all-season tires, swap them for all-season tires  ‚Äî trust me.

* Any car made in the past 10 years will start reliably in cold temperatures (below -10 c), as long as your battery is charged.

* Used cars in the US and Canada tend to be somewhat more expensive than in Europe.  (Check out a car blog for the reasons why.). In Ithaca, good used cars will be even more expensive than what you‚Äôll find in Syracuse or Rochester.  A lot of locals buy cars in Pennsylvania; for some reason, prices are much lower than in Ithaca or New York State.

* We don‚Äôt have French or Chinese cars, SEAT, Skoda, Dacia, or Lada in the US.  Suzuki is now an orphan brand.   A few Nissan models in the US are rebadged Renaults.  

* Volvos remain very popular among the hippie/crunchy crowd in town.  Despite their reputation as good winter cars, repairs can be costly.  Same thing with the Saabs that are still around.

* If you‚Äôre going to sell your car fast when you leave the US, it‚Äôs best to get a Subaru.  A warning about Subarus ‚Äî after about 100,000 miles (160K km), you may have to replace the head gaskets, depending on the engine and how the previous owner maintained the car.  Cost to replace - about $1200-$2000.

* For something that‚Äôs bulletproof but boring, a Toyota Camry or Corolla, or Honda Accord Civic, will be your best bet.  No AWD, but maintenance is inexpensive, and you probably won‚Äôt have any problems reselling it.

The economy was different -- you began to see peasants tied to their land to combat rural depopulation, so the first shoots of feudalism are being laid down; there's a general shift to monotheism (Sol, Mithras) before Christianity wins out and is finally adopted; art and portrait styles are different, you start to see medieval words like diocese, count, duke used to organize things. You can really see the sun going down on classical civilization once and for all, and for me it's just a cool place to hang around.

&gt;Well then it is down to the EU

It's up to both sides - as it always was.

&gt;Boris Johnson has said time and time again

Boris Johnson says a lot of things and then says different later.

&gt;we must be able to trade outside of the EU

Which you could, and did, prior to leaving even.

&gt;he was elected on the promise to negotiate on this basis

He also was elected on his oven-ready deal that he now needs to break international law to repudiate. This included the political declaration which, while non-bindning, was supposed to reflect the intensions of both sides.

&gt;if the EU decide they do not want to have a free trade agreement because we refuse to meet their demands

The EU has always been clear and consistent on the various requirements for various levels of deal. Other countries have had to face the same. 

&gt;which by the way are only designed to prevent us trading elsewhere and to make a failure of Brexit

They aren't. It is however not the EU's job to make a ""success"" of Brexit and certainly not to provide for the unrealistic promises of UK politicians.

&gt;there are plenty of developed nations outside the EU I‚Äôm sure would love to have quota free trading with us

All of which, like the EU, will have conditions attached. You'll note that the UK's deal with Japan contains provisions as to state aid and a level playing field. 

&gt;there‚Äôs very little the EU produce which can not be found outside the EU

Which is even more true in the reverse though the tyranny of distance is still a thing.

&gt;Europe refusing to trade with us to prevent our success

The EU is not refusing to trade with the UK, the question is what the terms of trade would be. If no agreement is reached the current default is WTO-rules.

&gt;nothing short of bitter self destruction.

Nope, Im arguing with you because you make no sense

&gt;Grow up, go to school, stop arguing on reddit just because you're annoyed American culture has taken over the US

Isn't that to be expected?

&gt;Yes, Europe gave birth to America, but does that mean George Washington's mother is more important than George Washington himself

Oh please, what a stupid comparison, Europe has lived for thousands more years and has been the center of the world up until America's discovery and it wasn't until 1776 that it wasn't no longer at the center, but then the Industrial revolution happened

&gt;In the timespan of 300 years, America has done more in the world than any European country, save maybe England, I mean, most European countries in their present form didn't really even exist in the past

That's what happens as technology advances. Also ,no that is wrong.

&gt;Stop trying to claim stuff that isn't yours lol, Europe was a cultural backwater for 1000 years and got lucky they found the new world. Europe managed to exist for a thousand years as a bunch of fifedoms, getting bullied by the Ottomans and by each other.

And making a shit ton of achivements.

My statement still holds, go study history or hell even current economy. The US might still be number 1 in terms of global economy but we're talking about culture here.

[],,sub_temple,,,,[],,,,text,t2_7f4xke98,False,False,[],"Playing the Angel was the first DM album I bought.  As a 17 year old, I had been aware of several of their singles and liked them, but I hadn't been drawn in beyond that.  I heard ""Precious"" somewhere and this was what caught my attention and brought me to the record store.  What I heard was an alchemy of velvety dark atmosphere and seductive melodies and that set me digging back into the discography.  PtA still stands out as a strong album, not in the ""best album since ..."" manner, but on its own merits.

I've heard a number of times that the European only vinyl release was the finest way to hear the album, as it had the best mastering of the versions.  So, a couple years ago I set about looking for a copy in the US at a reasonable price.  Last week my patience paid off and I came into possession of this lovely copy.  The following is a summary of my impressions after a couple listens.

First off: though I am a collector and fan of the format, I am by no means one of those who believes that vinyl is the master format.  I have plenty of CDs and files, and there are too many factors to consider here that affect this stuff.  Second: I am aware that there is a 2017 repress on 180 gram discs.  I have a copy of Ultra from this series that sounds good, but I haven't heard that version of PtA to compare.  Onto the thing itself.

The album comes in a 2 LP set, which works in favor of the sound because it gives the grooves plenty of room to breathe.  Side C has the most tracks at four, and that is only due to the short transition track ""Introspectre"".  As below, so it is above: the low end is very well served by this and the listener gets the impression of space in these songs; there is an airiness in the space between the beats that really allows for all the layers of sound to thrive.  On side D, the 2 track load creates conditions akin to a 12"" EP, with similarly pleasing results.

Is the good sound just a product of a groove economy which plays on the strengths inherent in vinyl playback?  I don't believe so.  The mastering on the cd and digital releases suffers from practices of the ""loudness wars"" which pushed the levels in the mix up to the max, resulting in distortion and a brickwalled effect on some tracks.  It creates a sensation of ""loud"" to the ears that catches attention in the short run but can be fatiguing over the course of an album.  This equalization cannot be achieved in the same manner on an LP, due to the physical limitations of the medium, so it requires a different mastering.  The alternative eq here tames the loudness of the CD well enough to let the music shine through.  

All in all, I have to agree that this is the way to hear the original PtA release.  It's deep and powerful and feels like I'm rediscovering my initial entry point to this great band.

What he meant was that modern people can‚Äôt get along without drums, flags and loyalty parades, and that it is better that they should tie their leader-worship on to some figure who has no real power. In a dictatorship the power and the glory belong to the same person.In England the real power belongs to unprepossessing men in bowler hats: the creature who rides in a gilded coach behind soldiers in steel breastplates is really a waxwork. It is at any rate possible that while this division of function exists a Hitler or a Stalin cannot come to power.On the whole the European countries which have most successfully avoided fascism have been constitutional monarchies. The conditions seemingly are that the royal family shall be long-established and taken for granted, shall understand its own position and shall not produce strong characters with political ambitions. These have been fulfilled in Britain, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, but not in, say, Spain or Romania.If you point these facts out to the average left-winger he gets very angry, but only because he has not examined the nature of his own feelings toward Stalin.

&gt;Today, after two decades of access to Eastern European archives, and  thanks to the work of German, Russian, Israeli, and other scholars, we  can resolve the question of numbers. The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans‚Äîabout 11  million‚Äîis roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians  killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had  believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the  Soviets did.

I'm having a hard time finding a non-paywalled version of the article, but from what I recall the gist of it is that while Stalin's murders did have a stronger racial bias than what was previously known, it wasn't as terrible as the Nazi genocides because Stalin didn't go full wipe-entire-races-off-the-face-of-the-earth genocidal like Hitler did.

Meanwhile, in the EU and the US you still have a large amount of people who think they wear masks to protect themselves and not others, and thus, masks aren't really necessary, or who will selfishly do the nth 'fuck corona and the lockdown and the system' party whilst simultaneously feeding the system by consooming. I mean, fuck, in one city we just had a mass outbreak because people thought a mega wedding without masks was a good idea, woops, +140 cases. We can surely enjoy another spike in 2 weeks after Halloween.

We are culturally taught to only care about ourselves and our own well being, our own careers, and ignore others problems. You could call it hedonism, but to me its just cultural stupidity in the fact that we are taught that there is someone to blame for every problem, just never yourself.

The first floating semi-submersible wind farm in the world, located in Portugal, entered its final stretch, about six months after being connected to the national electricity grid, by submarine cable, of the first turbine over 30 meters high to the lake on the Portuguese coast. . At the end of this week, there will already be three, in total, floating wind towers producing clean electricity in the middle of the national sea.

With an installed capacity of 25 MW, when it is 100% operational, the wind farm will be able to generate enough energy to supply the equivalent of 60 thousand families per year. WindFloat Atlantic will save almost 1.1 million tonnes of CO2.

The project is led by the Windplus consortium, consisting of EDP Renov√°veis ‚Äã‚Äã(54.4%), Engie (25%), Repsol (19.4%) and Principle Power Inc. (1.2%) and had financial support from the Government Portuguese, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank. Project partners include Principle Power, the joint venture between Navantia / Windar, the A. Silva Matos Group, Bourbon, the wind turbine supplier MHI Vestas and the dynamic cable supplier, JDR Cables.

This Thursday, at the end of the morning, it left the port of Ferrol, in Galicia, the third and last platform of the central Windfloat Atlantic, towards the coast of Viana do Castelo. The wind tower will now take three days to reach its destination, 20 kilometers off the Portuguese coast, where the first floating offshore wind farm in continental Europe is being built. ‚ÄúThe operation will be concluded when this last platform is connected to the mooring system created in that area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ocean and is connected to the other two structures already existing in the offshore wind farm‚Äù, explains EDP.

Anchored since July at its final address, about 20 kilometers from the coast of Viana do Castelo, the first turbine based on a floating platform (out of a total of three) was connected to the national electricity grid on December 31, 2019, through a marine cable that allows to flow the electricity from a renewable source produced by the wind turbine on the high seas. In early 2020, the second platform arrived on the site. The third and final turbine is scheduled to arrive on Sunday.

The floating wind power plant in the Portuguese sea will then consist of three towers 30 meters high, with a distance of 50 meters between each column resting on the platforms, and with the largest wind turbines in the world installed on a floating surface, each with a capacity of 8.4 MW production. The three floating platforms were built in an Iberian cooperation work: two left the shipyards of Set√∫bal (Portugal) and the third of the shipyards of Avil√©s and Ferrol (Spain).

The project uses the innovative WindFloat technology, which allows the three platforms to be anchored to a depth of 100 meters, minimizing the environmental impact and facilitating access to wind resources without exploring deep waters. The turbines are assembled on land and then towed to their final destination, without depending on complex offshore operations associated with the installation of the traditional fixed structures of offshore wind farms that exist in other European countries, such as Denmark or the United Kingdom, among others.

The Windfloat Atlantic is the result of the prototype WindFloat1 that was in operation from 2011 to 2016. The 2 MW pilot project successfully produced energy without interruption over five years, surviving completely unhurt in extreme weather conditions, including waves up to 17 meters in height and winds of 60 knots, in the same week that the American surfer Garrett McNamara broke the record for the biggest wave surfed in Nazar√©.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604334743,,False,0,{},gawr6qg,False,t3_jmjsks,False,False,t3_jmjsks,/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/jmjsks/portugal_builds_the_first_wind_farm_offshore_in/gawr6qg/,False,,1616010609,15,True,False,ClimateActionPlan,t5_ne8p6,r/ClimateActionPlan,public,,0,[],

If out of troubleshooting options, consider:

Threads Apr/May 1999 page 47:

""Singer needles work perfectly for Singer machines, but the shafts of these needles are slightly **thicker** than those intended for other brands. As a result, although they may seem to fit, the distance between the needle and hook (the rotating or oscillating part of the bobbin) is shortened just a frac¬≠tion of a millimeter, which is enough to cause skipped stitches, broken threads, jamming, and costly repairs. Likewise, a needle designed for a European machine does not have a shaft thick enough for a Singer. ""

Now, lots of folks use different brands: Singer, Schmetz, Organ are what I've seen around.  And most machines can use all of them no problems.  But I'd try a Singer brand, ball point or stretch or jersey, size 10 or 12.  Here is an example of using Singer needles in a Singer machine; read the comments by the OP:

https://www.reddit.com/r/sewhelp/comments/fsg68f/why\_is\_this\_happening\_from\_the\_bobbin\_side/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share

Now, you're using a well-known thread brand, but I notice a lot of fuzz on the thread and as a result a lot on your machine.  Clean out the bobbin casing area and under the needle plate with the vacuum and then rubbing alcohol on a swab to get the final pieces out.

If you didn't, take a look at the link above about thread.  Notice the non-fuzzy and fuzzy threads are the same brand, made in different countries.  Be picky about your thread.

I never addressed your issue with the top thread flopping around.  One of my machines does this too.  I would check the top threading, make sure it's in the tension assembly (#3 on your machine threading guide).  

Also your top tension is set at 3.  Have you tried adjusting, testing, and adjusting?

Anyway: capitalism is responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths.

This is before we consider the capitalist motivations behind European imperial expansion, which killed far more than Stalin or Hitler could have dreamed. And, of course, the upcoming climate crisis which could easily kill billions that is mainly driven by capitalism.

You only see the ""good"" of capitalism because it is so diffused through our society, and because you are so taken by propaganda, that you do not see the pall of death it has cast over the world for centuries. It has been an engine of great production, but we will need to break it and leave it behind lest our entire civilization die due to its rapacious, bottomless hunger for profit.

It wasn't published today, just *updated* today (likely to change the list of green list countries and/or revise the expiration date of the current policy).

This has been a common ""loophole"" that many people have been using when traveling from countries that are not permitted direct entry into European countries. Schengen countries typically permit entry from the UK, and the UK permits entry from anywhere.

Because of the exploitation of this loophole, some countries have tightened their restrictions to specify those who hold a resident permit or have otherwise spent a certain amount of time in the UK. Others remain open-ended, indicating they'll accept anyone traveling from the UK.

At the end of the day, though, this is up to the immigration agent.

This is the plan of globalists, they did so in Europe, neutered the public to the point they have NOTHING to prevent the erosion of whatever liberty they once had.  I've had countless discussions with liberals (of which I consider myself, largely) who keep trying to talk nonsense about the 2nd Amendment and how it was written back when muskets were around and they would've never written it if they'd have seen today's firearms, or, they'll say you can't even hunt with ""assault rifles.""  Both are completely moronic notions.  The intention of the 2nd Amendment was to NOT INFRINGE upon the rights of the citizens to have arms so that they could prevent a tyrannical govt. from infringing on the other rights.  To do that a citizenry would obviously need the latest and greatest, which we don't even have today, frankly.  Second, where the F is ""hunting"" in the Second Amendment?  It's not, yet nobody ever brings this fact up.

You want to truly lessen violent crime?  Try f'ing locking up those who use handguns to commit violent crime for 20 years for a first offense, no early release, full 20 years.  Nah, today we're letting them out on $0 bail so they can shoot someone else before they even have time to not show up for court.  We have Leftist DAs, Leftist Mayors and liberal Governors who prefer willful ignorance because to truly lessen crime it would take telling those committing the constant violent crime that they have a severe cultural problem, starting within the family, or lack thereof, and it would require career politicians to say things that won't get them reelected.  No, can't do that, better to paint the big bad black guns as the problem, LOL, sure, because that's even remotely logical!

[Check graphs, tables and other data in the article itself]

Only Romania and the Czech Republic have registered more Covid-19 deaths per inhabitant. If the trend continues, there will be 8,000 more official victims by Christmas
-

Spain has added 7,100 coronavirus fatalities to the official death toll since July. This equates to 15 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants ‚Äì the third-highest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe. In Germany, this figure is 10 times lower, and in Italy, it is just one-third of the rate in Spain. Portugal (eight), France (nine) and Belgium (12) are the European countries with the closest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants. What‚Äôs more, Spain reported an average of 150 daily Covid-19 related fatalities last week, making the virus the leading cause of death.

The only two European countries with a higher coronavirus fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants are Romania and the Czech Republic, which both saw a relatively low number of deaths in the first wave of the pandemic between March and June. But the number of coronavirus victims must be considered with care: the figure Spain reports to European institutions is based on information from the Health Ministry, which has had ongoing problems with underreporting and notification delays. For example, the Health Ministry‚Äôs official death count is 30% lower than the number reported by Spain‚Äôs regions.

Yet even with these problems, Spain recorded a daily average of 150 official coronavirus deaths last week. This figure is equal to all the deaths caused by respiratory illnesses in 2019 and is 10 times higher than the number of fatalities caused by traffic accidents in 1996, which was one of the worst years on record. If the rate does not slow, Spain will have recorded 8,000 more Covid-19 fatalities by Christmas. Spain only adds victims to the official toll if they have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The second wave of the pandemic has not hit all of Europe at the same time. Spain was one of the first to be affected. In France and Italy, coronavirus cases began to rise two to three weeks later. Typically, the number of fatalities start after a spike in cases, which leads to more hospital admissions and later deaths. Both France and Italy are trying to stop this from happening with new restrictions, the former with a total lockdown, and the latter by closing all establishments at 6pm. The next graphic shows how the number of daily reported coronavirus deaths has risen in 16 European countries, with the European average in grey.

The epidemiological curve in Spain is following a pattern that is very different from most countries in Europe. In August, the number of coronavirus infections rose more quickly than any other territory and by the beginning of September, the Madrid region had the highest cumulative number of cases in the continent. But just as France and Belgium began to report more cases, the number dropped in Madrid and plateaued nationally. This has been attributed to the first round of coronavirus restrictions introduced during the second wave and also to fear: perhaps the alarming data from August made Spaniards more cautious in September. The weather may have also played a role: if the cold and more indoor activity is behind the rise in Europe, it is not a surprise that Spain‚Äôs warm weather has delayed these effects. But since October, the number of hospital admissions and deaths has once again spiked: coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have nearly doubled.

Case fatality rate
-

The first table also shows the case fatality ratio or rate (CFR) in each European country since July. This represents the number of deaths out of all confirmed cases. In Spain, this figure has been around 0.8% since July. In other words, for every 100 confirmed diagnoses, nearly one person has died. The CFR in Spain is slightly higher than the average. Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary have worse figures, given that it is likely that many coronavirus cases are going undetected in these countries. Spain, however, is still a long way off from Germany, where the CFR has been 0.4% since July. These figures are an approximation: the CFR will rise in Spain as many recently contracted coronavirus infections have not yet had the time to cause deaths. Covid-19 fatalities also tend to be reported with more delays than new cases.

It‚Äôs also important to differentiate between the case fatality ratio and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). The IFR addresses an important question: what percentage of infected people will end up losing their lives to the disease? To determine this figure, one must know how many infections have not been detected, because they are asymptomatic or have not gone to the doctor. Last week, the Imperial College London published a detailed study that estimated the IFR in high-income countries during the first wave of the pandemic. According to the researchers, this figure was around 1.1% of all infections, taking into account undetected cases, based on seroprevalence studies. The study also points out that the IFR of the flu is at least 10 times lower, standing at less than 0.1%, according to data from the United States.
Differences between Spain‚Äôs regions

The coronavirus fatality rate since July varies greatly between each region in Spain. Arag√≥n was hit by the second wave earlier, with outbreaks among seasonal workers in July. The incidence rate has since stabilized, but has never truly dropped. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the region has continued to rise. Since July, Arag√≥n has had the worst fatality rate per population of Spain‚Äôs 17 regions: 54 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This is nearly double the figure in Castilla y Le√≥n (32), Madrid (30), La Rioja (29), Navarre (26) and Basque Country (23). At the other end of the spectrum are the Canary Islands and Valencia, where the fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants has been four to five times lower.

It is also important to remember that the official coronavirus death toll does not reflect the entire impact of the pandemic. This is firstly due to the aforementioned problems with reporting Covid-19 deaths. The most extreme case is Catalonia: the region has only reported to the Health Ministry 306 coronavirus deaths confirmed by PCR tests since July. This represents only 20% of the 1,400 fatalities ‚Äúsuspected‚Äù to have been caused by Covid-19, a figure that is likely to be more accurate as it is in line with the fatality rate of other European regions.

The other point to consider is the number of excess deaths according to the civil registries. During the second wave, the National Statistics Institute (INE) recorded 13,000 more deaths than in 2019 and 2010. This figure accounts for deaths from all causes, but is likely to include coronavirus fatalities that were not added to the official toll, as well as the likely rise in victims from other diseases, who were not diagnosed or received worse treatment as a result of the coronavirus crisis. They are excess deaths that, while not all attributable to Covid-19, are likely to have been caused by the health crisis provoked by the pandemic.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604340286,,False,0,{},gax328f,True,t3_jmskr6,False,False,t3_jmskr6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jmskr6/spain_has_recorded_thirdhighest_coronavirus/gax328f/,False,,1616016237,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

No ano passado entrei nesse curso, e apesar de estar na mesma faculdade, com a mesma intensidade de trabalho, consegui melhorar consider√°velmente as minhas notas e agora estou finalmente a gostar do curso!

Agora que j√° contei a minha hist√≥ria, vou te dar algumas dicas que aprendi com a minha situa√ß√£o:

1 - N√£o te compares aos outros. Tu √©s √∫nico, foste criado num ambiente √∫nico, tens um c√≥digo gen√©tico √∫nico, uma personalidade √∫nica, etc... Tu n√£o tens que ser igual aos outros que est√£o inseridos no teu meio, tens √© que estar preocupado em dar o melhor que consegues, e se isso for um 14 e n√£o um 18 n√£o √© o fim do mundo.  
2 - N√£o fa√ßas o curso s√≥ porque te sentes obrigado. Um dos maiores entraves que eu tinha √© que eu n√£o me conseguia ver a ter aquela profiss√£o, ou seja eu n√£o tinha motiva√ß√£o para estudar. Mesmo que por algum milagre te massacres completamente e consigas acabar o curso, vais ter que passar 40 anos da tua vida a fazer algo que n√£o gostas e provavelmente vais ter uma vida miser√°vel.

3 - Decide o que √© que tu queres. Com isto dito, n√£o te quero encorajar a desistires do curso e que te v√°s esconder para a cave da casa dos teus pais. Tens que explorar diferentes √°reas e seguir aquilo que realmente te interessa e que te consigas ver a fazer no futuro (mas tamb√©m n√£o escolhas algo irrealista)

You have disaffected Republicans who have abandoned their party but they are still conservative at heart, they just don't like the ruffians running the show at the RNC right now (Tea Party Trump Cultists). Warren is smart but she's too progressive for too many people. She has the same likeability scale that has maligned Hillary Clinton. The RNC always needs a bogeyman- Warren and AOC are the boogeyman of the day. Before it was Al Sharpton or Maxine Waters. I'm part of the 1%, I voted Joe Biden and dragged my husband too. My mantra has always been country over party any day. Plus it's a no brainer, constant drama and disasters of Trump's own making, it gets tiring. You can't underestimate what norms people are willing to break for 45. He's broken all the rules because he knows he doesn't have to suffer the consequences. He doesn't care. All these years where politicians have abided by unspoken rules and stuff, he doesn't. The politicians who tried to stand up to him, the moderates and stuff, got eviserated by the rapid trump cultists. That's why even if it was a republican governor, he's going to pick a republican centrist for senator. It doesn't matter- we keep hoping Collins, lisa Murkowski, mitt Romney do the right thing and they keep failing us. You need a majority. Manchin in West Virginia votes often times with his republican colleagues even though he is a Democrat. Manchin has voted with Trump more than any other Democratic Senator- 60.5 percent of the time. Doug Jones of Alabama though a D votes often times with the Republicans because his constituents are largely conservative in nature. Also warren can't bring out the black vote. That was the problem with Hillary. 

Harris has her problems but I would rather put her to the task about police reform since she was a prosecutor and knows the ins and outs of that area. Warren talking to the black community would seem out of touch. We need a centrist to try to heal both sides which is what Biden will do. Then he steps aside and has whoever wants to run in 2024. He didn't have to run, he had just lost his son Beau but I think the narrative from the DNC was none of the candidates running would be able to stand against Trump.

We still have a long ways to go. Warren is smart but she's seen as too shrill and condescending unfortunately. I'm hoping enough time will pass and maybe we 'll get AOC one day.

[],,vitormadureira,,,,[],,,,text,t2_68hp54al,False,False,[],"Obrigado por compartilhar sua experi√™ncia e sinto muito que esteja passando por isso. Parece estar sendo horr√≠vel.

Eu sou terapeuta e vejo muitos casos assim. Vou fazer alguns coment√°rios com base no que escreveu e na minha experi√™ncia.

Ao contr√°rio do que a maioria pensa, passar a vida inteira sem brigar √© sinal de um relacionamento p√©ssimo, n√£o bom. Indicativo forte de comunica√ß√£o ruim e supress√£o de emo√ß√µes.

Pelo seu texto, tenho a impress√£o de que isso aconteceu. Voc√™ ficou esperando a aten√ß√£o dele, esperando o carinho e isso nunca aconteceu. Ser√° que ele sabia disso? Sabia exatamente o qu√™ e como voc√™ queria?

Me parece que voc√™ relevava por causa do trabalho e da m√£e dele. Mas voc√™ ainda tem a necessidade e merece receber aten√ß√£o e carinho. Relacionamento √© para isso.

Se voc√™s realmente conversaram e ele n√£o levou em considera√ß√£o ou ele n√£o √© capaz de fazer, isso mostra incompatibilidade e/ou desrespeito.

Sua autoestima baixa pode at√© te dizer que voc√™ n√£o precisa ter respeito de um homem bonito, inteligente, trabalhador e cheio de amigos. Mas precisa sim.

Agora, sobre o v√≠cio de checar as seguidoras dele. Vou explicar um pouquinho como o c√©rebro funciona.

O c√©rebro est√° sempre tentando prever o que vai acontecer em seguida. Quando ele sente que pode acertar o futuro, ele libera umas sensa√ß√µes prazerosas. E quando esse futuro vai de acordo com nossas cren√ßas, o comportamento √© refor√ßado.

Existe uma expectativa quando voc√™ clica na aba de seguidores do seu ex. O prazer est√° na hora do CLIQUE, na expectativa de que o que voc√™ vai ver a seguir √© uma confirma√ß√£o que voc√™ √© pior que todo mundo. E adivinha? Voc√™ v√™ isso.

Cada vez que voc√™ faz isso, seu c√©rebro pensa ""t√° vendo? Estava certo mais uma vez!"". E ele continua.

Outra coisa, eu n√£o consigo acreditar que voc√™ quer proteg√™-lo de voc√™. Acho que voc√™ est√° mentindo para si mesma. Talvez de forma inconsciente, mas mentindo.

Me parece mais uma tentativa desesperada para ter uma sensa√ß√£o de controle na situa√ß√£o. ""Bom, se EU terminar, eu n√£o vou ser trocada por essas garotas melhores"". A mente costuma fazer isso.

Se voc√™ quer ter um relacionamento com ele, acho importante que voc√™ busque ser feliz individualmente. Fa√ßa as coisas que voc√™ gosta, com seus amigos, foque no seu trabalho, estudo, nas suas coisas.

Seja uma pessoa feliz e ele vai gostar mais de voc√™ do que qualquer outra garota.

Tamb√©m acho importante que voc√™ resolva a raiz da sua autoestima baixa porque seu problema n√£o √© sobre seu ex. √â sobre aquelas experi√™ncias que te ensinaram a n√£o se valorizar.

Voc√™ n√£o tem culpa de terem feito essas coisas contigo. Mas a responsabilidade de curar elas dentro de voc√™ √© s√≥ sua.

Ent√£o, em resumo, na minha opini√£o, s√£o essas coisas que v√£o te ajudar:

- mudar suas cren√ßas de valor;
- tomar consci√™ncia e questionar os pensamentos autom√°ticos que voc√™ tem na hora das compara√ß√µes;
- Ressignificar e superar suas experi√™ncias do passado;
- Criar estrat√©gias para adotar novos comportamentos (aproveitar a vida + combater o v√≠cio de ver os seguidores)

Como fazer isso? Terapia.

""J√° procurei um profissional"" n√£o √© bem uma desculpa. Voc√™ pode ter sido atendida por um profissional ruim, ou por um profissional com o qual voc√™ n√£o se identificou.

Para terapia surtir efeito √© MUITO importante ter confian√ßa e uma boa rela√ß√£o com o(a) terapeuta.

Eu tenho muita esperan√ßa que voc√™ consegue melhorar porque voc√™ me parece bem inteligente e j√° sabe que, racionalmente, n√£o faz sentido o que tem feito e sentido. E tamb√©m sabe que em um poss√≠vel pr√≥ximo relacionamento isso tamb√©m aconteceria.

Procure um terapeuta que se adeque a voc√™, e logo logo voc√™ estar√° √≥tima.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604340631,,False,0,{},gax3sfb,False,t3_jmi9u4,False,False,t3_jmi9u4,/r/desabafos/comments/jmi9u4/autoestimarelacionamentoinstagram/gax3sfb/,False,,1616016562,6,True,False,desabafos,t5_395lw,r/desabafos,public,,0,[],

Yes, and small businesses are suffering as a result. The economic damage as a result of lockdowns will be catastrophic. 

Mixed messages about masks and the vaccine and whatnot did not help but the fact of the matter, whether you want to accept it or not, is that had Trump not issued a travel ban on China and the EU there would have been a lot more cases and deaths than there are now. I dunno if you noticed but there was a delay in the US getting the virus there, and that's because of the travel ban. In multiple press conferences he repeatedly said ""I strongly urge the use of masks when necessary and if you can't socially distance"". Meanwhile Fauci, at the start of the pandemic, told us masks were useless. Then he told us we should all be wearing one. Whatever the reasons behind that were, he messed up big time and it's understandable that a lot of people dont exactly trust every statement he makes, similar to the WHO. 

While Trump was issuing travel bans, Nancy Pelosi was telling everyone to go and fraternise in Chinatown because ""xenophobia"" or something. 

Yes, there's been a lot of deaths in the US as a result of COVID. But again, the fact is that Trump acted based on the advice he was given by Fauci and the CDC at the beginning, it's understandable that people dont trust Fauci given the flip-flopping and had Trump not issued a travel ban there would have been a lot more deaths.

Contrast the history of the Middle East to the history of Europe and the West since 1945. We have experienced absolutely unprecedented wealth, prosperity, peace and development in that timeperiod. The ME on the other hand saw social decline, collapse of the old governing structures, a rise in authoritarianism, economic hardship, and was (and still is) the stage for proxy wars between various powers, notably during the entire cold war in which we supported autocrats to ensure longer term allegiance.

It is no coincidence that violent terrorism, religious or otherwise, is born in that environment and not here. But it is worth noting that this specific strand of religious terrorism is also a relatively new phenomenon. A (very short, non referenced and top of my head) rundown:

As you may know, in the decolonisation of the Middle East and the world at large many of the wars for independence (like in Algeria) were primarily borne out of nationalism rather than any religious affiliation. So how then did religion later start to play an ever more important role in government and society after independence? Much of it was bottom-up initially, in many places in resistance to western secularism and culture that was harshly imposed by increasingly impopular autocrat governments on a culturally middle eastern and decidedly religious (but not yet radically so) population. For reference look no further than Iran, and how the Shah's impopular governance created a dynamic of rising up against a perceived oppressor, helping the succesful claim to power of fanatics like Khomeini who had already been engaged in activism against the Shah for the longest time and who through his religious ties had greater organisational ability than most anyone.

While that situation was specific to Iran, the organisation of religious resistance to near if not completely dictatorial regimes with reform fantasies that were not at all consulted with the public at large can be recognised in multiple countries in the ME. Khomeini's power grab in Iran, as a succesful example of overthrowing an impopular government, also greatly helped the argument for a return to more purist Islamic traditions/values in the wider ME. As the role of religion in public life increased in importance, and the role of religion in government also increased when the autocrats were succesfully deposed, fanaticism increased. Both top down and bottom up. Saudi Arabia for one was actually (very) slowly on its way to liberalise before the Iranian revolution, but did a U-turn afterwards into far stricter Islamic governance. The organised religious rise against impopular governments also happened against the 'far oppressors' the West and the Soviet Union, who were far too busy using the ME as pawns on a chessboard than to care for the grievances of the people who actually lived there.

Enter Sayyid Qutb, a contemporary of Khomeini who was born in Egypt and who was raised as an Islamic scholar and school teacher. His life really is one I won't go into in much detail, as you should read up on it yourself, but suffice to say that his descent into religious radicalism was in no small part caused by his own fight against a despotic government and rather negative experiences with Western powers. One of which being repeatedly tortured by the CIA, an unfortunate affair which helped him rationalise the need for violent terror against the west to free the Middle East from the political, cultural and social influence of our society on theirs. Which, while terrible, wasn't really that irrational a sentiment given the context of his life. Unlike Khomeini though, Qutb was not succesful and instead summarily executed by the Egyptian government in 1966, but not before greatly influencing much of the Islamic world on the need for organised (violent) religious resistance against both domestic and foreign actors. One of those he influenced, none other than Osama bin Laden.

Now as I've written down this very brief history of the recent rise of Islamic radicalism in the heart of the religion, the Middle East, I hope you will all be a little more understanding to what contextual factors helped create that monster. Not at all the irrationality of its followers, or just simply the contents of the Qu'ran and Hadiths, but the lives led by people who had to endure tragic and harsh circumstances, finding in religion the necessary social organisation and mental fortitude to overcome. But, as we know now, with great consequences. To get back to the original point, it is worth noting that it is NOT simply religion which you can fault for the actions of people, that the violence in Islam has very rational contextual explanations, and that the solutions to our problems can't be in hating and othering the religious but in addressing the human circumstances that dramatically helped the rise of radicalism in the first place.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604342119,,1604358858,0,{},gax6yua,False,t3_jmn2em,False,True,t3_jmn2em,/r/atheism/comments/jmn2em/when_people_say_there_are_a_13_billion_muslims/gax6yua/,False,,1616018073,2,True,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,r/atheism,public,,0,[],

A great example is gun rights. In the US we can own a large variety of guns while in many countries in Europe there is no right to own a fire arm. So when you compare gun rights the US seems like a crazy dystopian society but traditionally in the US it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been. We have long traditions around hunting, shooting competitions, and in rural areas many people always have a fire arm on their properties because of exploding boar populations. 

I think what many people are worried about isn‚Äôt simple tax rates or anything like that. It‚Äôs usually a change to the system of government we have. An example of that could be the idea of removing the filibuster. In the US a senator can talk through an entire session to interupt as a way of suppressing the majority opinion (not exclusively, anyone can). This might seem like an outdated political tactic but in my opinion it does a great job of giving minority political parties slightly more influence than they would have otherwise.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"There is no shortage of writing from the last four years detailing the ways in which Trump himself, his supporters, and the Republican Party more broadly, have drawn on fascist ideologies and tactics. It is the overwhelming presence of such writing that makes me dubious as to whether you are actually curious or just feigning ignorance to be annoying. It saddens me that our political discourse has reached the point where I have to say that, so I am going to take you at your word that you are genuinely curious, and not just being a troll.

I made a throwaway account to write this, because, well, that's the internet.

Let me start by making it very clear that I do not think that every person who votes for Trump is a racist, a fascist, etc. I do think, however, that Trump and his core supporters display behaviors and traits that are accurately described as fascist, and I am personally disheartened and discouraged that so many people in this country, who are not themselves racists or fascists, fail to recognize these traits in Trump and vote accordingly.

I want to try and focus on precisely why many people (myself included) view Trump's ""convoys"" as especially obvious signs of fascism, while also pointing toward why ""Trumpism"" more broadly is fascist. The short version is that of course, there is nothing fascist per se about driving around showing support for your candidate. There is, however, something very fascist about the way in which these convoys behave. The open carrying of firearms, the over-the-top machismo, the vague threat of violence, the attempt to tie themselves to law enforcement. These are fascist traits. I'll steal a quote from Robert O. Paxton, a historian of fascism, from his book *The Anatomy of Fascism*:
&gt;Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

Okay, let's pick that apart. How does Trump's behavior and that of his supporters fit this description?

**obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood**: I hope this one is obvious: MAGA. Trump ran his campaign talking about the ""forgotten man"", drawing on grievances (many of which are entirely warranted, I should add) expressed by (mostly) white (mostly) rural voters, promising to rebuild all the rusting factories, etc.

**compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity**: Paxton's ""compensatory"" here means compensating for the perceived decline, humiliation or victimhood. I would point to the machismo and gun/flag-waving of the convoys as illustration of this. QAnon is of course the best example of this, more broadly, but see also the way that the Republican party has changed to revolve around Trump, instead of being built around specific policy points.

**mass-based party of committed nationalist militants**: ""mass-based"" here refers to the masses, in the sense of *not* the political/social/economic elite. The folks you see driving pickup trucks flying thin blue line flags and yelling about how much they love their guns and their country? Paxton is talking about those guys (and they are always guys).

**working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites**: see the way in which business leaders were not especially keen on Trump, but since his election they have mostly decided they're fine with him. See also the traditional Republicans who were initially vehemently opposed to Trump but have since come around (Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz are the best examples of this). Indeed, this way in which fascism emerges as a reaction by conservative parties and moneyed interests against the left is a common occurrence in places where fascism has arisen previously; refer to Paxton's book for details.

**abandons democratic liberties**: ""democratic liberties"" mean here the basic rights afforded to citizens of democracies, like free expression, the right to petition the government, the right to vote, etc., but also, more broadly, the norms and informal structures that ensure that political systems continue to function. Trump's repeated ""jokes"" about running for more than two terms are a simple example of this latter point. See also his refusal to commit unequivocally to a peaceful transition of power and his frequent unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Examples of disregard for the democratic liberties of the first amendment: Trump's hostility to the media, calling them ""enemy of the people""; his supporters' use of the term ""lying press"" (a direct English translation of Hitler's [L√ºgenpresse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_press)); Trump's support for applying sedition laws to journalists who write negative stories. Trump's hostility to protest (e.g., his frequent outbursts against kneeling football players, or threats against flag burners).

**pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints**: By ""redemptive violence"", Paxton means violence that allows the movement to recover from the humiliation, decline or victimhood referenced earlier. The militia and related movements that support Trump are the most blatant example of this, but this ""redemptive violence"" was also on display during Trump's rallies at which he encouraged his supporters and/or security to ""beat the crap out of"" protestors. Similar language has been present since Trump's 2016 campaign. Less overtly violent, but nonetheless illustrative, think about the idea of ""owning the libs"". The idea here is not to convince another group of some matter, but rather merely to cause them psychological distress. I claim that this is also the main purpose of these Trump convoys. What do they expect to achieve by these actions other than to antagonize and threaten citizens of liberal cities? The recent incident in Texas, in which a convoy antagonized a Biden campaign bus is a fitting illustration ([here's CBS's reporting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-launches-investigation-biden-bus-incident-texas-trump-supporters/), but feel free to google around; the basic facts of the incident are being reported pretty consistently by every outlet). Here was a group of Trump supporters who decided to intimidate and threaten their political opponents, endangering the lives of those on the Biden campaign bus and also the lives of other motorists on the highway (ethical restraints) and seemingly without any fear of legal repercussions (legal restraints).

**goals of internal cleansing**: Trump launched his campaign based on 1) Birtherism, 2) reducing immigration 3) increasing deportations. Enough said?

**and external expansion**: this is the only aspect of Paxton's definition that doesn't obviously fit Trump's Republican Party, in light of his isolationism, but see, for example, his offers to buy Greenland, or his tough talk about (I'm paraphrasing) ""taking all the oil"" when we invaded Iraq.

So, all told, of course there's room to quibble, but I think the most charitable reading one can give is that Trump and his core supporters have a number of fascist characteristics. Unless your definition of fascism requires that people be in the streets wearing swastika arm bands, there is a case to be made that Trump and his most vocal supporters are fascists.

[Here](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/02/is-donald-trump-a-fascist-an-expert-on-fascism-weighs-in.html) is an interview from 2016 with Robert O. Paxton. I find it especially interesting to read this now that we've had four years of Trump. *The Anatomy of Fascism*, is very much worth a read if you want a deeper look at why many folks who study this see Trump and Trumpism as clearly fascist.

[This](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/fascist-tactics-trump-wisconsin/) is a nice discussion of how Trump's response to the demonstrations over the summer were fascist, with some focus, conveniently for us, on Wisconsin (This article is behind a paywall, sadly, but you're a savvy internet user, I'm sure you'll find a way around it, and DM me if not). The Nation is a rather left-wing magazine, but there just aren't a lot of Trump-friendly news sources with discussions of the history of fascism. A key point raised by several of the people quoted in the piece is Trump's willingness to use violence against protestors, including tactics that are very unusual for the US. For example (all from over the summer): law enforcement using unmarked cars to apprehend protestors in Portland; law enforcement refusing to advertise their affiliations (police vs military police vs DHS etc) during crackdowns in Portland and DC; law enforcement's chumminess, for lack of a better word, with paramilitary groups (e.g., the group that Kyle Rittenhouse was associated with). Among the people quoted in the piece is Timothy Snyder, a historian specializing in 20th century Central and Eastern Europe, whose [article from over the summer](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/23/portland-fascism-trump-election/) touches on similar points.

^(By: Sonia Purnell | 368 pages | Published: 2019 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, history, nonfiction, biography, wwii | )[^(Search ""A Woman of No Importance"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=A Woman of No Importance&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;
&gt;  The never-before-told story of one woman's heroism that changed the course of the Second World War
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In 1942, the Gestapo sent out an urgent transmission: ""She is the most dangerous of all Allied spies. We must find and destroy her.""
&gt;
&gt;This spy was Virginia Hall, a young American woman--rejected from the foreign service because of her gender and her prosthetic leg--who talked her way into the spy organization deemed Churchill's ""ministry of ungentlemanly warfare,"" and, before the United States had even entered the war, became the first woman to deploy to occupied France.
&gt;
&gt;Virginia Hall was one of the greatest spies in American history, yet her story remains untold. Just as she did in Clementine, Sonia Purnell uncovers the captivating story of a powerful, influential, yet shockingly overlooked heroine of the Second World War. At a time when sending female secret agents into enemy territory was still strictly forbidden, Virginia Hall came to be known as the ""Madonna of the Resistance,"" coordinating a network of spies to blow up bridges, report on German troop movements, arrange equipment drops for Resistance agents, and recruit and train guerilla fighters. Even as her face covered WANTED posters throughout Europe, Virginia refused order after order to evacuate. She finally escaped with her life in a grueling hike over the Pyrenees into Spain, her cover blown, and her associates all imprisoned or executed. But, adamant that she had ""more lives to save,"" she dove back in as soon as she could, organizing forces to sabotage enemy lines and back up Allied forces landing on Normandy beaches. Told with Purnell's signature insight and novelistic flare, A Woman of No Importance is the breathtaking story of how one woman's fierce persistence helped win the war.

Some quotes from published work :  
-  There were 17 eligible studies. ‚Ä¶ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask‚ÅÑrespirator use and protection against influenza infection     
-  We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection  
-  Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant  
-  None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either Health Care Workers or community members in households . .   

There are lots more. The second one is kind of interesting. It's from a 2020 article in the New England Journal of Medicine. What's interesting is the bald statement ""We know that . . ."" That's a curious thing to write if it wasn't an established consensus view.

&gt;I literally just gave my reasoning, including practically all of Europe, North America, Brazil, India, JP, SK, AU/NZ etc. Every new country I look up shows me the same fucking thing 

You've eyeballed a few graphs. I'm talking about something much more technical and detailed. For example, if you look at the shapes of the curves for Europe they pretty much all have the same form. A steep rise followed by a slower decay. For different climates the curves look like a broader hump. 

So looking at the data for Europe my first question might be ""is there a correlation between the curve maximum and the date of lockdown?"". Another way of stating this is to ask how long after lockdown do we expect to see its impact on the mortality curve? I would suggest this is about 4 weeks - do we see this? In the UK, for example, we reached the turnover point (the maximum) before we might expect lockdown to have had any impact.

Another thing to note is that Sweden's mortality curve follows exactly the same shape - without lockdown - which indicates that for the European climate the shape of the curve is naturally 'baked in'. And Sweden's rolling 7-day average for deaths stands currently at 2 - and has been around this level since the pandemic ended there several months ago.

&gt;Do you not understand that if the virus continues on the current trajectory we will run out of space in our hospitals,

We didn't the first time around. Anyway - every winter we almost always have a bed crisis. This year will be no different - it's just that this year people will be tearing their hair and beating their breasts screaming ""cooooooooooooovid""

Technically no, practically, eh. Sure you can decide to not act on it, but clinical equipoise is often still not enough to find a reg or consultant that's willing to not play defensively. And then try batting off each time seniors change over as pt moves from AMU to ward, or the consultant/reg of the day changes over. It's exhausting and eventually someone will ignore what the previous senior has said and the patient will end up with a scan or on tx LMWH. Hence the easiest way to prevent all of this to not do the test to begin with.

&gt; formally PERC and 2 level wells had no validation as inpatient setting and use there was discouraged,but happy to be corrected otherwise.

For PERC my offhanded comment was just trying to suggest that one should think about and use it (and other tools) in the appropriate context talking about PE in general rather than suggest it was relevant in the OP's example. But you're right, even the [European validation](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(17\)30210-7/fulltext) excluded patients hospitalised more than 2 days, which makes sense given you're unlikely to have a sufficiently low pre-test probability if you're in hospital any longer for that alone to be enough to r/o PE.

As for Wells core, yes it was also originally developed and validated for the OP/ED population, but it has been looked at in the inpatient population too, although admittedly not as well studied ([[1](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-129-12-199812150-00002)] and [[2](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1160/TH07-05-0321)]). 

&gt; CTPA doesn‚Äôt sound unreasonable in someone with a procoagulant state who begins presenting with haemoptysis. It could be progression of COIVD. It could be PE

My point with the OP was about the utility of the d-dimer in all of this, not that one cannot or shouldn't order a CTPA in covid patients.

Sure it can be a PE, but I don't think a pro-coagulant state is, imo, alone a good enough justification to suspect it, all else being equal. We don't CTPA every ITU patient when we have a good alternative explanation for their hypoxia. There needs to be more than just haemoptysis. Why would a PE be a more likely explanation when they already came in with in a bleeding/coagulopathic state with that haematemesis? PE isn't the only thing that causes haemoptysis, certainly not if you've got a horrible viral pneumonia causing ARDS.

Moreover, having widespread ground glass opacities all over your chest makes it a lot harder to interpret a CTPA scan vs someone with clear lung fields. If after all that you get a report that says ""suboptimal scan, no major PE but unable to conclusively rule out segmental or subsegmental thrombus"" what have you achieved?

Punishing speed by removing someones car is also, already done here in Australia, if you get caught doing 40pkh over any posted limit you generally lose your car for over a month (or sometimes the Cop can decide to impound it no matter what speed you were doing). Do you know who this ends up hurting most? Lower socioeconomic people, families who rely on one car to get to and from work, and a study of all the cars impounded in one year showed they were ''shit box beaters'' that were not worth the polices time to even bother trying to re-sell them because of their worth. 

There are much, much better ways to tackle the road toll, driver education and training being the main one, mandatory defensive driving should be a must as should a very thorougher license test (unlike what we have here in Australia currently), there's a reason why alot of European countries have much much higher speed limits with less fatalities, education.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604350070,,False,0,{},gaxno9t,False,t3_jmufmg,False,False,t1_gaxkc5j,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jmufmg/the_govt_should_take_your_car_if_you_go_way_too/gaxno9t/,False,,1616025986,3,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,,0,[],

Your little brother may have a learning disability. I see that dyslexia has been mentioned but it can be more complex than that. He could have visual processing disorder, auditory processing disorder, etc. Reading is not something that comes naturally to humans, which is why it has to be taught and when we learn to read our brain takes all five senses to learn how to do it.

You will want to talk to his teachers and ask if there are tests that they can perform to narrow down what's going on. Let them know that grandma comes from a time and place where people who had a little bit of a harder time learning were brushed off as 'stupid' and that she has no concept of how to handle a situation like this. By being open and upfront with his teachers, you are ensuring that they have all the information that they need to proceed on how best to approach grandma.

Here are some programs that I used with my kiddos and which his teachers may or may not have on hand (these are for English though... I just saw that you're living in an Eastern European country; sorry I assumed you'd immigrated to an English speaking country, but I'll leave them up in case any English speakers need these programs):

1. Zoophonics: A-Z and a-z flashcard set with fun rhymes that help the kids learn the alphabet letters. If he's stuck on basic alphabet letters, this may be the place to start but you must follow the tutorial that comes with the package.
2. Barton System: For the most dyslexic children, to be used after learning the alphabet. This one must be administered by someone who knows how to use it in order for him to learn effectively.
3. Sonday System: For children who are closer to their own reading level or who are learning rapidly after going through some other remedial program.
4. Seeing Stars Sight Words: For learning tips and tricks on how to read words that don't follow spelling rules.

Again it doesn't have to be those three or four exactly. There are many wonderful programs out there. Also, it will help if you read to him a story each night. Make it fun and don't expect him to read to you at first. You want to build up reading as something that is exciting and fun otherwise he will resist reading his whole life.

O presidente dos EUA, [Donald Trump](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2020/10/conheca-12-livros-recentes-para-entender-era-trump-e-eleicoes-nos-eua.shtml), √© famoso por usar o recurso nas redes sociais. Em outra plataforma, a de disparos de emails a eleitores, o comportamento do republicano n√£o √© diferente.

 ""Vamos GANHAR essa disputa"", ""PRAZO FINAL: HOJE √Ä NOITE"" e, claro, ""FA√áA A AM√âRICA GRANDE OUTRA VEZ"" s√£o apenas alguns exemplos de t√≠tulos de mensagens enviadas pelo [candidato √† reelei√ß√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/10/reeleicao-de-trump-e-maior-teste-de-estresse-da-democracia-dos-eua-desde-guerra-civil.shtml).

 Emails s√£o utilizados em larga escala por pol√≠ticos nos EUA. Com uma base consolidada de apoiadores da elei√ß√£o de quatro anos atr√°s, Trump saiu na frente em rela√ß√£o ao seu advers√°rio, [o democrata Joe Biden](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/10/politico-profissional-habil-negociador-e-rei-da-gafe-biden-teve-vida-marcada-por-tragedia.shtml), no in√≠cio dessa disputa.

   
 Mais de 15 milh√µes de pessoas assinaram o cadastro para receber emails da campanha do presidente, o dobro do registrado pela candidatura democrata. Em n√∫mero de disparos, Trump tamb√©m supera o rival. Mandou em m√©dia 17 mensagens por dia em outubro, ante 5,7 de Biden, de acordo com dados do Sendview, site especializado em dados de marketing digital.

 O envio de emails √© um dos canais usados para impulsionar a [arrecada√ß√£o de campanha](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/09/durante-debate-biden-arrecada-doacao-recorde-de-r-21-mi.shtml), assim como mensagens de SMS, an√∫ncios na [televis√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/11/e-o-fim-de-uma-era-para-a-midia-nao-importa-quem-venca-a-eleicao.shtml) e nas redes sociais, al√©m da a√ß√£o de volunt√°rios na rua. As mensagens digitais, por computador ou telefone, s√£o mais eficientes por facilitarem o processo. Com alguns cliques √© poss√≠vel doar rapidamente.

  Nesse cen√°rio, a estrat√©gia agressiva de Trump para convencer eleitores por email parece ter sido menos eficiente. Desde abril, 2,7 milh√µes de apoiadores fizeram contribui√ß√µes √† candidatura de Trump. J√° o rival recebeu aportes de 4,9 milh√µes de pessoas e soma mais de US$ 1 bilh√£o (R$ 5,7 bilh√µes) arrecadado at√© o dia 25 de outubro. J√° o republicano conseguiu US$ 734 milh√µes (R$ 4,1 bilh√µes). Os dados s√£o do New York Times.

 ‚ÄãDiferentes empresas de monitoramento de email comerciais apontam que as mensagens da campanha republicana caem com mais frequ√™ncia na caixa de spam, destinada a mensagens indesejadas.

 Segundo a plataforma de an√°lise de dados SparkPost, os emails de Biden acabam sendo mais abertos pelos destinat√°rios. A diferen√ßa √© de 40% a favor do democrata, de acordo com o analista John Landsman.

 Uma explica√ß√£o para uma margem t√£o alta √© que n√£o s√£o apenas as pessoas que autorizaram o envio dos emails que recebem os comunicados dos candidatos. Muitas campanhas compram listas com endere√ßos eletr√¥nicos para envio de mensagens ‚Äîna maioria das vezes indesejadas para quem recebe.

 O uso desse tipo de pr√°tica foi regulado para fins comerciais nos EUA. A Federal Trade Commission, org√£o de prote√ß√£o dos consumidores, veta o envio de emails com ofertas a pessoas que n√£o aprovaram o envio.

 No caso de propaganda pol√≠tica, por√©m, a regra n√£o vale. A interpreta√ß√£o corrente √© de que, se a norma fosse aplicada na elei√ß√£o, haveria descumprimento da primeira Emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o dos Estados Unidos, que garante liberdade de express√£o.

  

 ""Essa lei s√≥ se aplica a mensagens comerciais. As mensagens pol√≠ticas n√£o podem ser classificadas assim, mesmo as de pedido de doa√ß√£o. N√£o h√° uma proposta comercial nesse caso"", afirma Hugh Brady, professor de direito constitucional da Universidade do Texas em Austin.  
   
 A reportagem da **Folha** assinou o servi√ßo para receber emails dos dois candidatos na √∫ltima semana de campanha. Ao ler as mensagens dos advers√°rios √© f√°cil identificar caracter√≠sticas do perfil de cada um ‚Äî ou, melhor, da imagem que tentam passar para o eleitor.

 Biden aposta num tom s√≥brio e informal. Dirige-se aos eleitores com ""folks"" (pessoal) e evita cita√ß√µes e ataques ao advers√°rio. O candidato n√£o √© o √∫nico a assinar as mensagens enviadas.

 H√° textos assinados por colaboradores da campanha e por figur√µes de seu partido, incluindo o ex-presidente [Barack Obama](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/10/minha-eleicao-obama-ganhou-mas-trump-ja-estava-ali.shtml) e ex-rivais na disputa pela nomea√ß√£o democrata para concorrer √† Casa Branca, como Bernie Sanders e Elizabeth Warren, todos endossando o ex-vice e pedindo doa√ß√µes para ele.

 ""Preciso ser honesto, as doa√ß√µes ca√≠ram"" √© o assunto de um dos emails do democrata em que pede ajuda financeira aos apoiadores. Em outro, quase se desculpa por mandar uma mensagem √†s 22h, no hor√°rio de Washington. ""Se voc√™ for ler um email hoje √† noite, espero que seja esse.""

 Enquanto isso, [a campanha de Trump apela para um tom mais agressivo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/10/perfil-mediano-e-tedioso-tornou-biden-alvo-complicado-para-trump.shtml) j√° no t√≠tulo do email. ""ALERTA ELEITORAL"", ""Joe Biden √© um pol√≠tico corrupto"", ""China Joe"" e ""America, I love you"".

 Nos textos, [o republicano segue o tom que o levou √† vit√≥ria na elei√ß√£o de 2016](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/10/em-2016-pesquisas-nao-indicaram-vitoria-de-trump-da-para-confiar-nelas-em-2020.shtml), com ataques ao que define como pol√≠tica tradicional. ""Eu n√£o me pare√ßo com um pol√≠tico t√≠pico de Washington, pois eu N√ÉO sou um pol√≠tico"", escreve o presidente, que acusa o rival de ser lobista da China e um ""exemplo de corrup√ß√£o"".  
   
 Trump recorre menos a endossos de pol√≠ticos. Sua campanha at√© envia emails assinados por outros republicanos, mas, al√©m dele, quem mais subscreve textos s√£o seu filho Donald Jr. e a nora Lara Trump.

 Com estilos distintos, os advers√°rios se igualaram em um ponto na campanha digital. Ambos fizeram chegar a eleitores mensagens comentando debates que ainda nem haviam ocorrido.

Ayant pris connaissance de votre annonce de stage de fin d‚Äô√©tudes de data science au sein de votre entreprise, je vous adresse ma candidature.

Durant mon cursus universitaire, j'ai pu √©tudier en deuxi√®me ann√©e l‚Äôintelligence artificielle et les algorithmes de machine learning, concr√©tis√© par un projet de fin d'ann√©e en reconnaissance faciale. Lors de mon stage de fin de deuxi√®me ann√©e r√©alis√© √† ESI, j'ai particip√© √† la d√©tection des pi√©tons. 

Actuellement, j'√©tudie le deep learning ainsi que les techniques de traitement d‚Äôimages classiques (eg. Classification, d√©tection, segmentation). 

Parall√®lement aux √©tudes acad√©miques, j‚Äôai eu √©galement l‚Äôoccasion de r√©aliser des projets personnels pour mieux ma√Ætriser les outils d‚Äôanalyse de donn√©es, de machine learning, de deep learning et de vision par ordinateur tels que NumPy/Pandas, scikit-Learn, matplotlib et TensorFlow/Keras.

Ces exp√©riences m‚Äôont permis d‚Äôacqu√©rir de nombreuses comp√©tences que l‚Äôon ne peut apprendre √† l‚Äô√©cole : capacit√© √† travailler sur l‚Äôanalyse des donn√©es et les visualiser afin d‚Äôen extraire une valeur ajout√©e, capacit√© √† travailler en √©quipe, √† organiser des priorit√©s, √† communiquer, √† respecter les d√©lais, √† pr√©senter des r√©sultats exploitables, etc.. Autant de comp√©tences qui me permettront de vous proposer des analyses utiles pour le d√©veloppement de votre entreprise.

Je vous remercie de l‚Äôattention que vous voudrez bien apporter √† mon dossier et reste √† votre disposition pour tout renseignement suppl√©mentaire ou entretien qu‚Äôil vous conviendra de me proposer.

&gt; Highlights:

&gt; * Citizens under 18 may lack the motivation and ability to participate in elections.

&gt; * We examine the political motivation and ability and their impact on turnout and vote choice quality for citizens under 18. 

&gt; * We use a survey from Austria, the only country with a voting age of 16. 

&gt; * Their reasons for not voting are not based on a lack of political motivation and political ability.

&gt; * Their quality of vote choice is no lower than among older voter cohorts.

They go into detail on how they measure ""quality of vote choice"":

&gt; We examine vote choice quality directly, though of course this is a concept that is difficult to estimate. We operationalise it as the ideological congruence between voters and the party they want to vote for: the greater the ideological similarity between a voter and the party she chooses, the higher the quality of vote choice.

&gt; ...

&gt; We measure congruence on the left‚Äìright dimension as the absolute distance of the voter from the party she voted for. Voter positions are measured using respondent self-assessments on a 0‚Äì10 left‚Äìright scale. Our first version of the left‚Äìright congruence measure compares this self-assessment with the voter's own placement of the party she voted for. Second, we compared respondent self-placements with expert survey scores from Hooghe et al. (2010), who asked their respondents to place Austrian parties on a general 0‚Äì10 left‚Äìright scales.

&gt; We can see that there are no significant differences between the different groups of voters for either left‚Äìright measure. While the mean distance is slightly higher among the younger voters, the difference is minimal.

&gt; In sum, when considering the precise choices made, we have no convincing evidence that the voting decisions of voters under 18 are in any way of lesser quality, that is, less congruent, than that of older groups of voters.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604353529,,False,0,{},gaxurpl,False,t3_jmszmo,False,True,t3_jmszmo,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jmszmo/should_teens_be_allowed_to_vote/gaxurpl/,False,,1616029363,1,False,False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,,0,[],
