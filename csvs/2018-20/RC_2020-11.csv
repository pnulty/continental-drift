I like the idea of an underground abortion railroad to get women from places where it's illegal to places where it's legal. What about abortion drones to drop pills to women? Some 25, 30 years ago, I read about Women on the Waves, a European organization that would take women in countries where abortion was illegal, go 12 miles out in the ocean or sea (international waters), and then perform abortions. I think they also do pill drops. That won't work in the U.S. because some of the most hostile states are landlocked. Maybe on Gulf Coast states?

If you're up to a quick Rome, I'd just modify that meme light tank a tiny bit and then produce a dozen, which can kill both Yugo and France within 4 months and &lt;50k casualties in the right hands. And then the good-old 10-0 infantry to hold my now extended line as I fight all across Europe, while I slowly add more punch into these meme tanks. Rome by 1940 at the latest (my first try), and sometime in 1939 if you do it well, and 1938 if you do it REALLY well.

For a later war, 20 width inf should be your backbone. In SP you CANNOT rely on allies so you need to go SF doctrine, which obligates you to the 10-0 template as your main division. You can try 14-4 infantry or tanks, mediums or lights are fine. 5-2-2 is a solid light template for micromanagement, 12-8 is a solid 40 width light tank division that can push and run around, and 13-7 is a solid medium division with SF. No need to mix random things in. Add SPAA or at least support AA if you don't have air.

120k casualties is like all I took during my entire Rome run, and that was with... light tanks, motorized, cav, etc. No advanced weaponry, pretty much no airforce. 60k casualties is all I took during my most recent Barbarossa as Germany. Micromanagement and good divisions always triumph. You shouldn't start a battle you cannot win easily, unless there is a reason, i.e. pin. Therefore you should never get into a situation where you need field hospitals to conserve men. If FH cannot repay its expense on each division, it certainly cannot repay itself over your entire army. It's that simple.

Maintenance costs production. And it increases your IC/hp ratio which makes you bleed more. You're probably unaware of this.

Recon company is useless because the recon stat is useless. it only shifts tactics SLIGHTLY in your favor, and you want the RIGHT tactics to be chosen, which are not necessarily the countertactics anyway. Recon also provides speed bonus, which is useless for infantry because infantry needs to defend, not push. It provides a bit of attack with SF but too expensive to justify that. Therefore recon company is worthless on infantry.

You should rush tanks nonetheless. Stay one tech ahead of the AI helps. Only having 1939 armor in 1939 is something to be ashamed of.

Heavy TDs make space marines which is a very questionable concept, except for a few cases. In most cases the expense is unjustified.

Issues that can exist are:
Ingredient causes skin irritation or allergy.
Ingredient is unsafe for environment or marine life.
Ingredient is a hormonal disrupted or estrogenic. 

Most ingredients are restricted due to potential of skin irritation. For example, if 1 in 100 people commonly experience irritation from a substance left on the skin for a period of time, in the EU and via IFRA, thot ingredient would be restricted. It does not mean that ingredient is dangerous. It means it causes skin irritation to 1% of the population.

Yes there are brands that have poor ingredients. It‚Äôs usually brands that use candle oils or fragrance oils meant for other uses. There‚Äôs brands out there that purchase from fake/low quality suppliers and will list reconstitutes of scents like ‚ÄúGardenia Fragrance‚Äù which have no regards for ingredients. I‚Äôve come across it commonly enough. However, I could argue that the fragrance quality in a Bath and Body Works product is usually equally as poor (and not something you want on your body).

Truly unsafe ingredients are not used in fragrances, or are used in such minute amounts that they have no impact on your biology. Most safety tests are done in massive quantities on mice, so if a mouse develops a tumor from an aroma molecule over a 3 month period by being doused in 3x it‚Äôs body weight in it regularly then that molecule will be restricted or have use regulations.

If you are a woman, you do have to be concerned about ingredients that mimic estrogen. There‚Äôs not many, but it‚Äôs better to avoid them. However, it‚Äôs silly for someone to be afraid of the minute amounts in perfume but eat food and apply cosmetics that are mimics.

I would be far more concerned with cosmetic ingredients which stick to your skin overtime than with perfume which doesn‚Äôt really penetrate.

The natural versus synthetic comment above is misguided. You have the exact same irritation concern with both, however, natural ingredients aren‚Äôt disrupting marine life or your body chemistry.  Issues with thujone  are from consumption (injesting via tea or usually drinking essential oils) not diluted topical application if anyone even does that. 

https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/public-statement/draft-public-statement-use-herbal-medicinal-products-containing-thujone_en.pdf

Natural ingredients do have a risk of photosensitivety over synths but it‚Äôs truly rare. It‚Äôs a myth that ‚Äúcitruses‚Äù are photosensitive, it‚Äôs a myth that every single diy perfume blog repeats. Sweet orange/blood orange does not encourage photo sensitivity, nor do many others. Bergamot in its original form does (and is likely the most used citrus in perfume), and due to the high amounts could be an issue, however it is almost always now the non PS version of it that is used, as it‚Äôs quite difficult to obtain anything else, so it no longer is a cause for concern.

Sadly even the penis thing is true, it's called penile subincision and it's graphic.

However the voters themselves are very likely not (besides the loud minority driving around with their Trump flags).

I'm from France, and it's actually very similar there.

The main difference is that France, as opposed to US, has many more prominent parties. Instead of Republican vs Democrats, we got RN (far right), LR (right), LREM (identified as Centrism but mostly right), MODEM/UDI (centrism), PS (left), FI (far left), Communist, Green Party and so on.

However, in the past 20 years, extremists parties managed to get more popular. Part of it is because they managed to soften up their speech and because the traditional left/right parties get more and more disconnected with the people, making extremists parties look more down to earth.

Interestingly, this pushed the traditional parties to adopt more hard line positions, in an attempt to get back the votes from these extremists parties. In the end, it clearly did not work well, and, in the last election, the traditional parties completely exploded and were replaced by a brand new party. This new party was founded by our current president  and is actually the equivalent of the traditional right wing from a few years ago, just marketed differently.

So now, what do we have? Popular extremists parties that soften up their tone, and destroyed traditional left/right parties that are taking more hardline position in vain.

Does that mean french people are becoming more extremists? Actually no. Most of them have the same ideas as 20 years ago. However, they want to express how fed up they are with politics being so distant from their problems. My own mother voted far right in the previous elections, mostly because of this.

If we go back to America, the parallel exists. I'd say it's even worst because America truly only has two main parties with barely any nuance in their position. It baffles me when mainstream medias are unable to understand why Trump was elected at the first place: because people are fed up with politics and feel that Trump understands them. Trump is a political outsider, and he still is! I would even argue that as bad as Trump was during his presidency, he still has chances to be re-elected for the same reasons: people argue that Trump did nothing, but if you take the position of someone voting for Trump, you can see Democrats playing politics in the House to block every of Trump's moves, and that's what matters!

It's similar to France where one party will try to pass a law that the other party would normally submit themselves, but where this other party will vote against just to prevent the first party to be successful, under the cover that the law is not doing enough. It's pure bullshit, and that's what people do not want anymore.

I talked about France and US, but it's equally true in many other countries. Europe has seen extremisms rising in many countries in the past few years, mostly for the same reason: traditional politics failing to understand people's problem, coupled with economic problems related to free market.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604202776,,1604203231,0,{},garfivj,False,t3_jlvmca,False,True,t1_gardey4,/r/changemyview/comments/jlvmca/cmv_if_you_are_voting_for_donald_trump_in_this/garfivj/,False,,1615919683,3,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

Eu continuei falando com ela ap√≥s isso s√≥ que chegou a um dia onde ela tinha dito que ficou com o amigo dela, amigo esse qual eu sempre demonstrei inseguran√ßa. Jurei nunca mais falar com ela e a bloqueei em tudo (menos no Instagram)

Chorei por dois dias e duas noites at√© que ela manda mensagem no instagram dizendo que tava com saudades e n√£o conseguia viver sem mim. Eu, tolo voltei!

A gente voltou a conversar e eu ainda tinha sentimentos por ela, at√© ela come√ßar a ficar seca e parecer n√£o se importar com minha presen√ßa mais. Ela tinha arrumado algu√©m, algu√©m melhor talvez eu n√£o sei.

Ela sempre postava stts de conversas com ele enquanto eu sempre ficava escondido, como se fosse um bot√£o de apoio na qual ela podia apertar sempre que precisasse. Sabe oque eu fiz??

I am not willing to sacrifice anything and everything to mitigate the problem/I do not necessarily think the benefits are worth all of the proposed costs. 

* By extension - urban redesign (including housing) and infrastructure. I literally drive a 50 year old (give or take a few years) car every day. 

* Guns - I do not support any federal ban on any gun that currently is not federally banned - the single politician who is in favor of this that I‚Äôd vote for is Tulsi Gabbard. I do not support any buybacks, limits on the number of guns one can possess, or mandatory payments. I do support greater background checks, more pre-purchase education/training, greater mental health care, and probably other measures that I‚Äôm forgetting currently. I also wish the NRA would return to its more education-focused position of the past, for all gun enthusiasts. 

* PC culture, *somewhat* - I am black but wokeness makes me cringe, white saviorism makes me cringe, and I do not agree with the common argument that being PC = not being an asshole, but I think people should be respectful publicly and I don‚Äôt really mind the social repercussions of today for saying offensive shit publicly. I think this stems from my belief that nobody will ever eradicate racism from any one country, let alone the world, and that sometimes I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth trying to (remembering the past achievements of previous campaigns/our current better position vs. going about civil rights activism the wrong way, i.e. now) 

* Preserving the Electoral College (not the same as uncapping the House, which I‚Äôve become more open to)

* Immigration, *somewhat* - I‚Äôm pro-DACA and think Dreamers and their parents should all be given a path to citizenship. I thought Trump‚Äôs family separation policy as immoral, though I didn‚Äôt seemingly spend every waking moment of my life after learning about it thinking about it. Further asylum seekers should be strictly vetted and/or our legal immigration system should be as restrictive as that of Canada‚Äôs and a few select European countries. 

* By extension - I do not have endless empathy/a bleeding heart. I can‚Äôt spend all of my time thinking about all kinds of human rights violations in the world. I was born black, but I wasn‚Äôt born an activist. Some people are born a certain way but want to live in the shadows, and that‚Äôs perfectly okay. I was a Bernie supporter circa 2015-early 2016 and got burnt the hell out. Likely stems from my basic belief that this world is cruel, it‚Äôs always been cruel, it‚Äôll always be cruel, and it‚Äôs not really worth trying to fix that. 

* Individualism (over collectivism), to an extent and valuing negative freedom over positive freedom, to an extent. 

* Refusal of service when it comes to businesses, though I‚Äôm not set in stone here - I‚Äôve just had my fair share of sketchy experiences and kind of (again, not set in stone) would rather just know not to enter than set foot inside and feel threatened. 

* Criminal justice, *somewhat* - I‚Äôm not in favor of going totally rehabilitative/restorative - we should certainly make our system much more rehabilitative, but we should still have a punitive aspect. And I don‚Äôt care if people‚Äôs mugshots are online before they‚Äôre convicted of anything.

If people should be happy because others have it worse than we should also be sad because others have it better too, it‚Äôs nonsensical and baffling why this is trotted out so frequently as though it makes any sense at all.

Suppose scenario X and Y are both bad, but Y is worse than X. What, should X be happy then because their bad situation is less bad than Y? Nonsense, they will of course both be unhappy.

The US is a dumpster fire for the poor ‚Äî minimum wage hasn‚Äôt budged in 10 years even to keep up with inflation while cost of living continues to rise. [The bottom 80% of the country combined which includes most of the working middle class only has 7% of the country‚Äôs wealth (and this has only worsened since the time of this citation)](https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM). For the average working person, Europe and Canada (even Australia) are going to be better places to live on average. 

For the rich, yes, nothing beats the USA that I‚Äôm aware of, but the vast majority of people aren‚Äôt in that boat. We don‚Äôt even have healthcare which is nuts. Andrew Yang was right and the only candidate to give me real hope in years. But obviously all of the owners who benefit from the current system don‚Äôt want change since it would make their lives slightly more inconvenient. It‚Äôs an irrational use of resources that we allow people like Bezos for example to exist while so much suffering that is not our fault is present. Suppose a CEO makes 60 million in a year ‚Äî his life and the lives of his kids and their kids are set just from that ‚Äî we do not live in a meritocracy, at least not anymore.

As a tangent from that, the truth is not everyone has a net positive life ‚Äî if you‚Äôre poor and you have kids you‚Äôre most likely damning them to a very difficult life of wage slavery, debt, and poverty. For their sake, don‚Äôt do it. For example, if I‚Äôm poverty stricken in India, why the fuck would I have kids? Think about the suffering they‚Äôre likely to endure and how hard their lives will be? Why put that burden on them? I would never have kids unless I could help them and provide for them ‚Äî in the US that means helping them get through the financial void that is university at the very least.

We can examine it in hindsight, and it isn't just that there is incremental progress that is hard to spot.  No, the protests were *entirely* unable to make lasting changes.  As far as I can tell, the movement was not able to get even a single piece of legislation passed. 

While modern media allows people to quickly join movements and get connected to recent events, the quickly spreading nature of memetic material is not a benefit for protests.  It means that protests grow faster than they can be organized and whipped into shape, leading to little direction possible beyond than 'march that way'.   

This is doubly so because grassroots movements grow from many places at once which predisposes them to decentralization. It is no coincidence that the most renowned protest movements have had clear leaders, and it is much harder for such a structure to exist in the age of social medial. 

And I wouldn't even say this is a Western phenomenon.  The Arab Spring was similarly decentralized protest with vague motives, and likewise had little results before resorting to mob violence.  And unlike vague postering en masse, mob violence is unfortunately very effective at achieving its simple goals. 

There are also other worldwide protests to look at, all of which failed.  The Iranian Green Movement.  Failed to achieve reform.  The Spanish Indignados movement, etc.

If you can't be more specific that's impossible to address. We are responsible for Syria. Their ""civil war"" wasn't, it was a terrorist uprising and the government of Syria put it down in under 3 months...then the US got involved and began funding, arming, and training those fighting the Syrian government despite knowing that it was mostly terrorist groups. The war stretched on for years, destroying much of the infrastructure and turning previously peaceful cities into war zones. Before that, Syria was roughly 10% christian, last I checked it was under 1%. Muslims showed up and told them to convert or die. The US is 100% responsible for all of it. 

But what about the first 3 months before we became overtly involved? Where did the fighters come from? Iraq. That we overthrew, for no good reason. Estimates of the death toll reach as high as 1 million as a direct result of our invasion, but after reading the studies I agree with the ones estimating 500k more. What kept all the warlike muslims in check in Iraq? A strongman dictator. We installed him years before, then we removed him. Even the UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, said it was in violation of international law.

Oh, and Libya? Ghaddafi is gone now. Under him he turned Libya into one of the best countries in Africa by most metrics. Access to clean water, education, and so on. Not that he was an angel, but they were stable. Now it's a terrorist shithole, divided up by warlords and constant fighting. You can even find slave markets there, as it's making a comeback. It wasn't like that before. The terrorists who tried to fight Ghaddafi and oust him had no chance without our air support and bombings helping them.

Those three countries are absolutely our fault. Those are the pipeline into europe. If any of those 3 remained intact, some to most of the ""refugees"" wouldn't be in Europe right now.

&gt; Would you support getting involved in other countries to help end war crimes, pogroms and other heinous events? 

Didn't you notice? Our involvement WAS THE WAR CRIMES. If you feel morally obligated to stop events like mass murder, then you should be opposed to the US foreign policy that is killing so many people. If you object to things like the beheadings in France and no go zones in Sweden, consider who set the board for those directly responsible to end up in  Europe in the first place.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604213828,,False,0,{},garrdjg,False,t3_jldfe1,False,True,t1_gap28ar,/r/Libertarian/comments/jldfe1/what_are_your_most_important_issues_right_now/garrdjg/,False,,1615925294,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],

Long story short, their customer service is a joke.

Got my 2018 XPS with 1 year warranty from Dell, plus another years warranty from the British store I bought it from ‚Äî fabulous. I even negated Dells student discount and bought the item full price just to get that extra year, thought that was well worth it. 

My first mistake was 2 months in, dead pixels occurred in the bottom right corner. It wasn‚Äôt enough of a problem for me to send it back and wait **three weeks** while it gets shipped from **Scotland** **to the Netherlands** for repair, as I had important work to do. 

At the 12 month mark, just under my Dell warranty, it all went tits up. Could smell smoke, USBs stopped working. I nuked the devices and got in contact with Dell. 

This was 2 weeks under the first year‚Äôa warranty. 

It gets to Dell, and I am billed ¬£390 for water damage, which includes replacements of the touchscreen(?), motherboard, keyboard, and hard drive. 

So firstly, water damage was a fabrication. Apparently their litmus paper detected it, but nothing had been spilt on this machine. I did some Googling and apparently a change in climate can do this, and this laptop had been from the Tropics to the Arctic within that year (don‚Äôt ask), so maybe that caused it. 

I went full Karen and challenged this. I agreed that maybe the motherboard had fried, hence the smell of smoke, but just couldn‚Äôt work out all of these tertiary problems ‚Äî like the screen(?!). 

‚ÄòThe screen?‚Äô I thought, but then I remembered the dead pixels from before. 

Well, 2 weeks of emails back and forward with somebody higher up; some div lower down **sent back my laptop unchanged**.

I found the Dell number and was furious. They arranged a courier to pick it up **again** in the meantime.

But when I opened the package, it wasn‚Äôt the dead pixels they billed me for, the screen actually had a spider-web crack on it like some Kyle thought it was a toilet wall. I thought, great! I have photos the day I shipped it so Dell or UPS have dropped my device. 

I send it back off and 2 days later, I get another Dell email billing me for **¬£560**.

They decided to add an aluminium casing to the list of repairs. What an actual joke service centre.

They also said my device was now out of warranty. Ergh. 

So I called up the store I bought it from and they just said ‚Äòif they say it‚Äôs water damage, then it‚Äôs water damage. Your warranty is void.‚Äô

I swear I was about to refer myself to my GP at this point. This is 1 month into my original claim at this point by the way. 

After going higher up at the British store, it got to the point where they believed me and my problem, having had photo evidence from the first referral etc. 

The chap took on the challenge, and delegated the task of chatting to Dell to himself. Thank god I thought.

Well that lasted... 1 day. Dell called me direct and complained that every time that they called this British store they had to wait 40 minutes on the line. What a stupid, utterly **stupid** thing to say when I had spend upwards of 24 hours waiting on the shitting lines of both of these companies.

Dell gave me an ultimatum, pay up or we‚Äôll send it back. I said something like ‚Äòlook, no. This device has a problem that has gone up way higher than the others at the service centre. Can you just keep it for now and wait until one of your line managers has taken some time to look at it?‚Äô. 

He reluctantly agreed. But why did I even need to tell him this? Surely alongside a serial number there is a list of past services tickets ‚Äî some still open during that time. 

A week later, I called my contact at the British store, who had actually given me his personal number to avoid the phone queue. We‚Äôd actually become quite good friends I though; he too thought Dell were a bunch of imbeciles. 

While the store was still reluctant to pay of the  entirety of the ¬£560 sum, they offered my to pay half of the original bill (¬£195), because the second bill was so painfully an attempt at getting more money. 

Why send two differently priced bills for the same problem? Who runs the European service centre?

""IMPENETRABLE RUSSIAN TANK ARMOUR STANDS UP TO EXAMINATION

By Richard M. Ogorkiewicz

Claims by NATO testers in the 1990s that the armour of Soviet Cold War tanks was ‚Äúeffectively impenetrable‚Äù have been supported by comments made following similar tests in the US.

Speaking at a conference on ‚ÄúThe Future of Armoured Warfare‚Äù in London on the 30th May, IDR's Pentagon correspondent Leland Ness explained that US Army tests involving firing trials on 25 T-72A1 and 12 T-72B1 tanks (each fitted with Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour [ERA]) had confirmed NATO tests done on other former Soviet tanks left behind in Germany after the end of the Cold War. The tests showed that the ERA and composite Armour of the T-72s was incredibly resilient to 1980s NATO anti-tank weapons.

In contrast to the original, or 'light', type of ERA which is effective only against shaped charge jets, the 'heavy' Kontakt-5 ERA is also effective against the long-rod penetrators of APFSDS tank gun projectiles, anti-tank missiles, and anti-armour rotary cannons. Explosive reactive armour was valued by the Soviet Union and its now-independent component states since the 1970s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the T-55 and T-62 tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units.

""During the tests we used only the weapons which existed with NATO armies during the last decade of the Cold War to determine how effective such weapons would have been against these examples of modern Soviet tank design. Our results were completely unexpected. When fitted to the T-72A1 and B1 the 'heavy' ERA made them immune to the DU (Depleted Uranium) penetrators of the M829A2 APFSDS (used by the 120 mm guns of the Cold War era US M1 Abrams tanks), which are among the most formidable of current tank gun projectiles. We also tested the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger (the gun of the A-10 Thunderbolt II Strike Plane), the 30mm M320 (the gun of the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter) and a range of standard NATO Anti Tank Guided Missiles ‚Äì all with the same result of no penetration or effective destruction of the test vehicles. The combined protection of the standard armour and the ERA gives the Tanks a level of protection equal to our own. The myth of Soviet inferiority in this sector of arms production that has been perpetuated by the failure of downgraded T-72 export tanks in the Gulf Wars has, finally, been laid to rest. The results of these tests show that if a NATO/Warsaw Pact confrontation had erupted in Europe, the Soviets would have had parity (or perhaps even superiority) in armour‚Äù ‚Äì U.S. Army Spokesperson at the show.

Newer KE penetrators have been designed since the Cold War to defeat the Kontakt-5 (although Kontakt-5 has been improved as well). As a response the Russian Army has produced a new type of ERA, ‚ÄúRelikt‚Äù, which is claimed to be two to three times as effective as Kontakt-5 and completely impenetrable against modern Western warheads.

Despite the collapse of the USSR, the Russian Tank industry has managed to maintain itself and its expertise in armour production, resulting in modern designs (such as the T-90, the T-95 and mysterious Black Eagle) to replace the, surprisingly, still effective Soviet era tanks. These tests will do much to discount the argument of the ‚ÄúLion of Babylon‚Äù (the ineffective Iraqi version of the T-72M) and export quality tanks being compared to the more sophisticated and upgraded versions which existed in the Soviet military‚Äôs best Tank formations and continue to be developed in a resurgent Russian military industrial complex.""",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,,0,1604219149,,False,0,{},garvyu8,False,t3_jlyt0g,False,True,t1_garvrnv,/r/Warthunder/comments/jlyt0g/m829a1_silver_bullet/garvyu8/,False,,1615927479,-6,True,False,Warthunder,t5_2uc6j,r/Warthunder,public,,0,[],

We had a few evenings talking in our ""Mannschaftsheim"" (a bar/restaurant open to all ranks within the barracks). We talked about a lot of stuff, military, family, even history, war etc. 
Fascinating man, fascinating (yet sobering and sad) experience. I found out that his family was to be imprisoned by the Nazis and fled to england, later to israel from there on. They used to live in the same area my family comes from (northern Harz region). I was so blown away when i mentioned a few cities and villages and he actually heard of them! Turns out that in a different chain of events we might have been friends (same age, same area, pretty rural - usually you know most people around) or workmates. He told me that his grand parents still ""never arrived in israel with their hearts"", they still mourned their old home - despite the obvious terrible fate that they would have suffered, had they stayed.

My Question: Is this something that older israelis still see in a similar way? Do you (younger generation israelis) still have to cope with the personal traumas (sorry, i don't know enough english to word this any better) of your parents/ grand parents / great grand parents? What's your ""mindset"" when you hear about those ""old places""?

Remember this is *independent* of endangered species ranking.  Some snails are more rare than humpback whales, so ignore conservation status here.   Some vegans and animal rights people like to make a big deal out of sentience, animal that perceive their environment at high levels.  But other vegans oppose [Speciesism](https://www.peta.org/features/what-is-speciesism/) and regard all creatures of equal value. From PETA: 

&gt;Speciesism is a misguided belief that one species is more important than another. This toxic mindset is deeply ingrained in our society, and it results in all kinds of negative consequences. 

The breakdown:

&gt;*1) Top of the list:*   Our beloved pets: dog, cats.  Also whales, elephants, and great apes, said to have higher intelligence (sentience).  These are seen as particularly special animals.

&gt;*2) Second Level:*  Special animals that do not make level 1, though many people believe they should be on level 1).  Horses, eaten in Europe like beef, are a good example.   Many Americans want protection for the West's feral horses. Some people want pigs to be here.  Both are more intelligent than most mammals.

&gt;*3) Third.*  Run-of-the-mill mammals:  deer, raccoons, badgers, kangaroos, wolves, bears, sloths, beavers, bison, skunks, birds, etc. *Also mammals we customarily eat: cow, chickens, pigs, sheep, ducks, etc.*  Many, many dozens of animals under this Category.

I'm sure some Zionists were deliberately ignorant of the needs of locals, out of racism. Racism was wide-spread back then: in the UK, in the US, in Palestinian Arabs and in Jewish Palestinians too. It wouldn't be particularly productive to look back and say ""See, Zionists *were* racists"", when in fact almost everyone in the World was racist back then. 

If you are against British Colonization, then in a sense it also makes sense to be against Zionism: I don't believe Zionism was a colonialist movement itself, but I do believe it piggy-backed on colonialism to succeed.  
That said, incidents of Jews fighting *against* the British Mandate are also well recorded, and the White Paper was a magnificent display of anti-Semitism on behalf of the Brits, in spite of European Jews being in dire need of help during these years in particular.

It's more realistic to look at the Jewish immigrants in the region VS. the Arab population, and their behaviour over the last 100 years. 

Why? Because I don't really subscribe to any religious or racial logic of ""This land is mine and only mine because a book or because my ancient grandfather said so"". The history of humanity has been defined by consistent immigration and emigration, everywhere, and the story of the Israelis and the Palestinians isn't that unique if you look at it at a wider historical scale (although it *is* one of the most interesting cases).  


Although terrorism was initially caused by both sides, against each other and against the British Mandate, there are overwhelming examples of Arabs working with Jews, Jews learning Arabic and Arabs learning Hebrew. Both sides are to blame for the steady escalation of violence.  
What I do blame uniquely on the Palestinian Leadership is their all-or-nothing mentality, that led them to reject every. single. peace deal throughout history, at the expense of their own people. This is where Palestine has failed.

That's why the attitude of the people  of the USA doesn't change suddenly over night when a new government is  in place, or when there is a new election. Like this Tuesday. It changes gradually, year by  year, percent by percent. And those changes rarely end up in headlines,  for all to read about. They happen in the background, quietly. 

&gt;Yes, there's obviously plenty of homophobia in the usa, but it's a very big &amp; diverse nation.  

Indeed, but that doesn't change that the average is quite different from many countries in Western Europe. Because of its size, the USA is quite unique in its huge and stable geographical pockets of homophobia, and huge and stable geographical pockets of tolerance, as many people in this sub have testified about.

&gt;Remember that in a huge part of the european union, gay marriage has no prospects of ever happening. 

Gay marriage or domestic partnership (which is really the same thing) is already in place in almost all EU countries. I can think of six countries out of 28 (27) where this isn't in place, all of them new member states. So what ""huge part""? 

And are you seriously imagining that things won't change, just like they have the last thirty years? Imagine if someone said in 1990 that ""gay marriage has no prospects of ever happening"", because almost no country in the world had it? Every single country in the EU, and the West, have seen huge improvements in public attitudes towards gay people. Poland has seen the biggest improvement in the EU these last ten years, for example, despite, or even because of, the current government. Do you seriously believe this development will somehow magically stop completely for ten years, twenty year, thirty year...? No, my friend, every country in the world will legalise same-sex marriage, it's only a question of time, albeit several decades in some cases. 

In the six EU states I mentioned resistance to gay marriage might have been close to 100 percent not long ago. Now it's down to 70-60 percent or so. In ten years it'll probably be closer to 40-50, if not better, and they will be close to actually enacting gay marriage. It's not rocket science, it's happened lots of time before.

As such, 8 September 1917, the Bolsheviks occupy Petrograd, with the support of other soldiers. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks start to occupy other parts of Russia. The country has entered a civil war. Meanwhile, some parts of Russia become to declare indepedence, includinf Finland, Ukraine, and some little countries in Caucausus. The Bolsheviks began to occupy large parts of Russia(most of the European Russia, parts of Turkestan and Siberia)

Meanwhile, they sign an peace with the Central Powers on 17 November 1917, and a peace treaty on 21 January 1918, ceding large territories to Central Powers. At the same time, Finland enters a civil war.

Trust me non of them must have occurred at all because in the end we are same humans it is ""us"" who are suffering. Another point that I'd like to raise if you open the list of the attacks by those muslims (for sure they aren't) check where they've occurred. Answer: in Muslim countries themselves in my country Pakistan ( which is a Muslim country). 80% of global terrorist attack victims are Muslims. Now u tell me if it's Muslims or Islam who are actually doing these attacks then why the fuck they're bombing themselves most? Why they are causing most casualties in Muslim countries why not in the Europe? Because those dumb people are NOT Muslims at all neither they've anything to with Islam. They've been inflicted upon Muslims and it is us Muslims and Islam who are actually being oppressed: by West on one side and those Terrorists on the other. It's completely insane to say that Muslims are  supporting these attacks at all for what on earth they would? U just need to think about everything with an open mind. 
Besides that even if you wanna compare ( which is pointless because again HUMANS are being attacked ) 30 years in days become 10,950 days so now you can see 300 hundred attacks in 10,950 days is like one attack after months but when u look at 182,000 attacks in 10,950 u need to think about it because there's been more than a lot which your eyes have missed or should I say the entire Media forgot to report. U gotta think that the deaths of countless western human were actually  kept away from you because the attacks were actually done by westerns. You've been reported in very particular way to make u end up with one conclusion that Islam is not a religion of peace. No country, not even mine one, will ever report where it has been wrong.  Why it is that if a white attacks people the event is considered awful and sad and black day for humanity but if it is caused by a Muslim( even if it occurred in a Muslim country) it is said that ""Islam is not a religion of peace""?
In the end I'm sharing a  link and I would highly recommend you to watch the video, in this Mahdi Hassan is talking about a research by an american university on terrorism caused by so called Muslims and Western people:

In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ‚ÄòGod save the King‚Äô than of stealing from a poor box. All through the critical years many left-wingers were chipping away at English morale, trying to spread an outlook that was sometimes squashily pacifist, sometimes violently pro-Russian, but always anti-British.

Ikke fordi jeg ikke mener at diskussionen  kan v√¶re vigtig, men fordi du gang p√• gang skyder mig noget i skoene som jeg hverken mener eller har sagt eller antydet. Det er vildt belastende.

&gt;	For det f√∏rste mener jeg ikke at danske b√∏ger, eller danske film eller danske br√¶tspil eller hvad ved jeg, er s√• ligegyldigt som du pr√∏ver at g√∏re det til. 

Jeg har ikke p√• noget som helst tidspunkt hverken sagt eller antydet at danske b√∏ger, film eller br√¶tspil er ligegyldigt. Det er fuldkommen grebet ud af luften.

Jeg har blot bedt dig om eksempler p√• hvad det er for danske produkter du mener man ikke s√¶lger hos Amazon, og som du tror vil blive solgt hos Amazon hvis og n√•r de ""kommer til Danmark"".
Du bliver ved med at sk√∏jte rundt om det ret simple sp√∏rgsm√•l, og det g√∏r det frustrerende at tale med dig.

Nu kan jeg s√• se at produkterne er ""danske b√∏ger, danske film, danske br√¶tspil og hvad ved jeg"".  S√• er vi da kommet lidt l√¶ngere end f√∏r, og jeg giver dig da ret i at det kan t√¶nkes at Amazon vil begynde at s√¶lge den slags p√• et tidspunkt.  Jeg ved s√• stadig ikke hvad du mener med ""hvad ved jeg"", men jeg antager at det er fordi du reelt ikke kan komme p√• andre s√¶rligt danske produkter.

&gt;	Kommer an p√• hvad du mener med hvorn√•r nogen er p√• det danske marked. 

Amazon har et dansk dom√¶nenavn som i tidernes morgen omstillede til deres UK-baserede butik, og i de senere √•r omstiller til deres tyske butik.
De har udvidet gratis levering til at g√¶lde leverancer til Danmark.

Tager man det i mente skal man virkelig g√∏re en indsats for at p√•st√• at Amazon ikke er p√• det danske marked. Man skal faktisk tale direkte imod bedre vidende.

&gt;	Som sagt er alle verdens webbutikker jo i princippet p√• det danske marked

Nej, det er noget √¶vl og det ved du godt. Butikker der sender deres varer fra ikke-EU lande er ikke p√• det danske marked. De h√∏rer ikke under dansk lovgivning.

&gt;	Hvorvidt de ‚Äúer i Danmark‚Äù virker p√• mig som en ligegyldig teoretisk diskussion du kan have med journalister.

Det er fandeme s√¶rt at du har brugt flere dage p√• at diskutere det med mig s√•. Det er sjovt nok det hele denne snak er g√•et ud p√•.

&gt;	Der findes da butikker der giver gratis levering

Ja. Amazon. Er der andre butikker som leverer gratis hvis du k√∏ber for ‚Ç¨30? Jeg spurgte dig f√∏r, men du har ikke rigtig kunnet komme med et eksempel.


&gt;	Apple er jo for det f√∏rste et hardware brand og ikke en webshop. 

Apple s√¶lger hardware fra egen produktion og fra andres produktion, og s√¶lger derudover en r√¶kke services. Det er faktisk ikke en helt dum sammenligning.

&gt;	Men selv Apple har mig bekendt ogs√• en dansk webshop p√• dansk sprog osv. 

Korrekt. De har en dansksproget side. Jeg forst√•r ikke helt hvad du mener med ""osv.""? Kan du uddybe?


&gt;	Kan godt v√¶re du mener den slags er ligegyldigt, men der er mange i dag der ikke vil handle p√• en amazon.de men godt p√• en amazon.dk p√• dansk.

Hvorfor tror du det?

I hope people remember the political climate, and discussion in the UK, pre 2016.

In   2015 Labour campaigned on a platform of cuts to our public services.   They tried to out-do the Tories in both austerity measures and   anti-immigration rhetoric.

If   Corbyn had never become Labour leader, we'd never have mainstreamed the   question: Why do the working people of Britain have to pay for the   crimes of bankers via cuts to the public services they rely on? Why has   public money been used to secure bankers bonuses when they partook in a   criminal act of malpractice in their debt leveraging and credit  default  swap gambling?

There  would never  have been a mainstream discussion about how a strong  welfare state is  needed to drive up wages, and we'd never have seen a  nuanced discussion  about immigration and how it's used as a scapegoat.  We'd never have seen  a positive force in the mainstream of British  discourse pushing for  house-building, strong wages, public services and  a transformative,  state-led Green New Deal.

We'd   never have had the conversations about how a profit motive will never   ever be sufficient to tackle the climate emergency and how the market   cannot and will not fix it.

Labour   were truly pathetic weathervanes before Corbyn's leadership: too meek   to challenge the Tory hegemony over this country and too comfortable to   invest in understanding policy that works across Europe.

The   problem with taking the easy road is that it cements these archaic and   regressive ideas in the minds of the public. It makes them believe the   only way forward is via the hegemony created by the astronomically   wealthy few who own the media and direct British discourse. When it   comes to actually implementing something progressive, the public are too   subdued and too scared; they no longer believe something better is   possible because nothing is ever really on offer.

Seraphine's case is REALLY sophisticated to explain on the perspective of Koreans. You need to understand the political&amp;historical&amp;cultural backgrounds and relationships of Korea, China and Japan.

Well, I agree with some comments concerning racism. Some reacts are impolite and imply hatred to a certain nationality. However, most of Koreans do not ignore and undermine China and its culture itself as the way they want to be treated.

Korea, China and Japan are neighbors to each other, and also kind of rivals. If someone says those 3 coutries are same or similar, all these ppl from those three will literally mad. Even the details of chopsticks are different. They are influenced by the others, but they also keep their own tradition. Naturally, they compare to the others and assert that 'I am the best among them.' (I think you can find other examples in Europe, America and anywhere in the world.)

It could be just an undesirable competition, but sometimes one of the three lies that it has originalities on tradition songs, dances, pictures and etc from the others.(Even history) These awkward situations make the case worse.

Since 2000, China has grown mega in the aspect of both economic and culture. China's voice in the world also gets more focus. Both Korea and Japan feel that sometimes China steals cultural and historical advantages. 

Recently, Genshin is considered as a 'perfectly copy and paste' of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild by many Asians. As the same way, Koreans think that China takes K-pop throughly from Korea and makes theirs. 

KDA was introduced as a K-Pop group. However, this new KDA's song does not seem like a K-pop to Koreans. It is more like... Riot makes some kind of C-pop to Kr ppl. I think it is because of the language differnces. Chinese and Korean are way different, actually both cannot interact with each other. Grammar, vocabs, and everything. Yeah, it is similat to English but K-pop was born under the influece of English songs. Um, maybe some of you say this is just a brand new style, but even the music video's style is Chinese one.(Colors, style, code... very subtle but Kr ppl can 'understand')

Moreover, most Koreans thought that KDA is a special gift for Korean LOL players from Riot. Like Star Guardians to Japanese players(based on Japanese Mahou girls animations), and new year's skins to Chinese players(based on Chinese tradtional dresses). Even I feel like... my surprised gift goes to other person as a birthday present.

I would not feel disappointed if Riot makes a new singer's group with a Chinese style. I don't know why they pushed Seraphine into KDA. Maybe next then those two groups make a collab, that would be great...

I disagree. Those with Chinese doctor/nurse friends, such as myself, knew very early (because these people, especially nurses, love to gossip/discuss interesting cases in group chats, and they build a very close relationship with their fellow students, including juniors and seniors, which means a nurse will often have friends working at 20+ different hospitals). I was aware of the situation looking really dire back in mid-late December. So were Taiwan, and I suspect many other countries. But the CCP kept downplaying the situation and forced WHO to do the same, so I can understand why people who have no interest in China didn't know.  
  
&gt; Literally no country was going to just close all flights simply due to the discovery of a novel coronavirus. At the start it was still being researched and studied, and nobody even knew if it was human to human, airborne, or anything like that.  
  
The Chinese government and medical workers knew, as they could surge in patients suffering from similar symptoms, as well as their colleagues getting infected. But they were censored by the government before they could warm the population to take caution. When China forced WHO to say there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission then you already had many detected cases, including a Chinese in Thailand - it was such a disastrous statement for WHO to make. There were also many leaked videos of people collapsing on the streets in Wuhan.. I remember seeing videos of at least 10 different incidents.  
  
&gt; Yeah, in hindsight we could have closed all flights in January, but even that wouldn't have been enough given it has seen been detected as early as October in Europe  
  
It would've been enough if China decided to shut down their borders until the situation got under control, but they of course had no interest in doing that (and decided to do the opposite, and even allow people from Wuhan to leave the country). And to make matters worse then they had its companies and citizens buy up all medical equipment all over the world and ship it back to China, and subsequently ban exports of medical equipment.

However, some people exclusively vote becauss they either had their rural roads paved (barely), or they got a job because of them.

So, how does getting a job in the public sector look like?

Well, my friend, you either spend years in college to be extremely qualified only to go abroad for work that pays a decent wage, or you cant find one with your high school (if you even have an education or skill), so you resort to becoming a member of the SNS pyramid scheme in which you do work for a while until they say you finally deserved your below average wage job.

Oh, and the dead can also vote, some parts of the country even had ABOVE 100% turnout rate. AV is like what you might hear about Lukashenko, except he is mild enough in his oppression to not alarm the EU.

There was also ~11%(at a below 50% turnout) support for the socialists, which are the ghouls from the Milosevic era, supporters are either braindead, actually dead, yugonostalgic, communist, or all of the above.


The third party of the govt. coalition is some sort of ""patriotic alliance"" lead by a former vaterpolo player which ironically is more progressive in it's plans than the conservative ""progressive party"". However, all three parties share their values of crony capitalism, nepotism, and liberty measured by your bank account.
This political party barely made the cut with ~3.3%.
Why does this matter? Earlier this year, around January, they reduced the necessary 5% of votes to be able to enter the parliament to a miserable 3%.

The party that almost made the cut with 2.9% were the monarchists, which are satelites, much like every other party. There was one anti-govt/true opposition option and it was a bloke who resolved to conspiracy theories because he was losing support, but they actually participated only so they can report irregularities at the polling places, which is cool of them.

There was another choice of ""opposition"" which was supposed to boycott the elections like the rest of them, the leader is an actor, and he claimed he would boycott, then claimed he was offered half a milion euros by SNS to participate at the elections and declined it, then he participated anyways, meaning he probably accepted a much higher bribe and would not be a true opposition anyways, so people agaist the government literally didnt have an option to vote for.

The neurosis of the virus - or the neurosis virus

J. R. GUZZO OCTOBER 23, 2020

Eight consecutive months of covid are increasingly making it clear that one of the worst side effects of the epidemic was a massive assault on the mental health of people who never had a single real symptom of the infection, nor did they need any kind of medical care because of it. This pathology, barely noticed at the beginning of the wave, and progressively installed in the victims' daily behavior, manifests itself through a basic anomaly: the passive, and then very active, acceptance of irrational convictions in their brain, emotional and psychological system. It is as if the general key that ensures normal functioning - or what was considered normal until some time ago - had been disconnected, somewhere, from the circuits in which human thought moves.

Does it make any sense for the citizen to enter a restaurant, sit at the table and just take off their mask when eating - or, even worse, to put on and take off with each mouthful? Of course not, but anyone who behaves this way is convinced that he is right and the rest are risking their own lives - and his life, in the most radical instances of anti-virus activism. It is not normal, in the same way, that many people consider it essential, in addition to the imported ""bike"", helmet and uniform, to wear a mask to ride a bicycle outdoors. They do as they did in the year 1300, or so, when the barons, doctors and priests convinced people that the black plague came through the air. (His capital advice, 700 years ago: ‚ÄúStay at home‚Äù.) Mothers have been seen to put mini-masks on their babies when they go for a stroll; it is obvious that the only disease present in the case is in their head.

In France, the cradle of Western-Christian-progressive civilization, beacon of wisdom, intelligence, logic and humanism, the authorities have just taken a truly extraordinary step: the country's almost 70 million inhabitants are prohibited from leaving their homes among at 9 pm and 6 am. No restaurant, bar, cafe, concert, theater, club; only the next day. We are like this, then: according to the French government, the virus only catches at night; during the day the citizen can move around at will, as the animal leaves and only returns when it gets dark. Naturally, they say that their action will reduce ‚Äúthe crowding‚Äù of people (being close to their peers, in these days of mental disturbance, is almost a crime against the homeland), but in reality it is nothing like that. Why would ‚Äúcrowding‚Äù at night be worse than ‚Äúcrowding‚Äù at noon? It is pure herd panic on the part of government officials who still have no idea what to do and use, to give their orders, the religious acceptance of ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù.

This is the reality; the same France that gave us Descartes, Voltaire and Balzac today gives us Emmanuel Macron. Do what? C‚Äôest la vie, the French themselves would say - that's all we have to offer at the moment. The problem with the French president, and the agents of his government, is not exactly having wrong ideas. The problem is that they are not able to have any idea - not an original idea, or even simply usable, or for some useful purpose. They just repeat dead ideas; there is no risk of creating anything. It is not just Macron, obviously, or just France. It represents only the average quality of governments that prevails today in the countries of advanced Europe. Even more: Macron is one of the mega-victims, also he and many good people, of the progressive psychological collapse that the epidemic brought to everyone.

In Brazil, possibly because there are at least some 150 million people here who are too poor to have this type of neurasthenia, something that is private to the middle classes upwards, the virus's footprint is more harmless. It is much more in the media, in the high castes of the civil service and in the media where, in general, people don't really have to work to earn a living than in the majority of the population. What involves Brazil in the great mental anomaly brought by the covid is, on the one hand, the medical or scientific superstition that has become curiously common today. This type of superstition is very popular here and around the world. Basically, doctors know about covid not much more than they did in February; as they do not know, they invented the ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù. Most men of science, of course, know perfectly well that the aberrant behaviors described above are very close to insanity. But they don't want to talk about it; they are afraid of being accused of genocide, or something, if they open their mouths to say that two plus two is four. If not even the President of the Republic escaped the accusation of killing 160,000 people, including by the Supreme Federal Court, why would a simple doctor who has to earn his living go against the psychoses that command current thinking?

This on the one hand - on the other hand, and even worse, there is the voluntary behavior of people. A very large number of people decided to take the Gospel of ‚Äúsocial detachment‚Äù to extremes; they want to live in isolation, in the belief that they can postpone the hour of death if they stay ‚Äúat home‚Äù, as mandated by YouTube ‚Äúopinion makers‚Äù and charlatans (light model, but charlatans anyway) of the new scientific belief. They were convinced, by some kind of imbalance in the apparatus where their reasoning is formed, that being free from covid they are also mysteriously free from liver cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction. In this great neurosis, they broke away from the outside world as much as possible and reduced their physical contact with other human beings to a minimum. They have moved away from neighbors, friends and even their own family members - they consider that the worst thing that can happen to them is seeing someone else. They started out of fear, only; then they started to like it and today they think it is better to live like this.

There are a lot of people thinking about a ‚Äúlife change‚Äù: the current life comes out, full of selfishness, inequality, etc. etc. and enters the life of the new millennium, increasingly virtual and increasingly virtuous, where digital communication via WhatsApp, Zoom and other tricks is becoming the ideal way - or worse, the only way - to keep in touch with other beings of flesh, bone, soul and heart. They want to live like this for as long as possible and, in the most extreme cases, forever. There it is not the fault of the precarious governor Wilson Witzel, national champion of pro-confinement dementia and now removed from office, according to official complaints, for being a thief - a thief of money destined to fight the epidemic, by the way. It is the fault of whoever is choosing to live like this. The problem, in these cases, is not with the covid, neither with governments nor with President Macron; is in their heads. The real disease will not be found in the infection of the lungs, but in the brain equipment of each one.

During the¬†unification of Germany¬†in the 19th century, Arminius was hailed by¬†German nationalists¬†as a symbol of German unity and freedom.[9]¬†Following¬†World War II, however, Arminius was¬†omitted¬†from German textbooks due to his association with militaristic nationalism, and many modern Germans are unaware of his story; the 2,000th anniversary of his victory at the Teutoburg Forest was only lightly commemorated in Germany.[9]

That is a quote taken from wikipedia, the article on Arminius.


And what is posted below is a quote from a der spiegel article on the issue:

But Germany is marking the event with noticeable restraint. There's no sense of glory and no program of flag-waving festivals of the sort one would expect in other nations celebrating their creation

In fact, a lot of Germans don't even know about Arminius. Many schools shunned his story after 1945 because he became contaminated by the militant nationalism that led to Hitler.

The book is written in a lighter way and touches on lots of different topics that should be familiar to people. Albert Einstein, the end of the First World War, Hitler's impact (or lack of impact) during the Weimar Republic, Inflation, the Great Depression. It also has a lot of things that most people haven't heard of and goes into detail about a wide variety of aspects of life.

Shirer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich) is one of the most well respected and thorough narratives of the origins, actions and impacts of the Nazi Party. The book itself is over 1,200 pages and is some times split into three parts, focusing on the Rise, the Reign and the Fall of the Third Reich. Shirer starts as early as the unification of modern Germany and describing the impacts of the First World War on the complex populations and politics of central Europe.

Fucked in what sense? I was simply pointing out the Taiwan is staring down the barrel of a much bigger gun. Covid is awful, but it will end, eventually. Your problem isn't going away any time soon. 

&gt; China aside, this statement is full of shit.

It's really not. Every single East Asian government (even the 'democracies') is decidedly more authoritarian than any of the major Western liberal democracies. It's not a controversial fact. Throw that in with the fact that East Asians tend to be more pliant and subservient than Europeans, and that's why you get the comparative difference with respect to handling the current pandemic (never mind the fact that you all had the correct behavior beaten into you during SARS, whereas Europe did not).

I live in London, the vast, vast majority of people wear masks in enclosed spaces, shops, transport, etc... You are about 4 months too late with that point. The contact tracing successes of, say, Korea, rely on a) beginning from a low base, and b) invasions of privacy that would never be accepted in the West. It's true that Europe could have done a much better job in this regard than they did. But to pretend that we could have replicated what was happening half a world a way is ridiculous and belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the different societies and the social contracts we have with our respective governments.

Okay, so I now have one observation and one follow-up question:

**Observation**: I understand the European cultural aversion to paying for things with money you ""don't have"" via credit card. In the U.S. there is a fairly widely accepted idea that you should *always* use a credit card *if possible*, given that U.S. credit cards give you points, perks, etc. *on every/many daily purchases*. By contrast, using a debit card does nothing for you from the standpoint of credit-building, and bonus perks.

Obviously, (and unfortunately) there is a not-insignificant segment of the U.S. population that ends up getting itself into trouble when more in expenses are charged to a credit card than can actually be paid off from a debit/savings/checking account every month. This results in having to pay significant interest on the remaining monthly credit card balance, etc. *However*, assuming you are charging to your credit card responsibly, and paying it off in full every month, you can accrue a boatload of bonus points for things you were going to pay for anyway with your debit card. So credit cards &gt; debit cards.

**Follow-up Question**: Now that I understand the European situation better, what would you all recommend as the best/most intelligent way to earn some amount of points/cash-back/perks on every-day purchases here in the EU? Are there lots of bank-specific European debit cards that give some level of perks? Are there some competitive European credit cards you could recommend to me despite the fact that they might offer fewer perks than US credit cards? Should I continue to use my fancy-shmancy US credit cards for their perks, and then just go through the slight annoyance of exchanging currency ‚Ç¨---&gt;$ in order to pay them off every month?

Here is the study

A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers (2015)
http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751

Conclusions: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

Harvard Study published May 21, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine

""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In  many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.""

CDC study on the use of personal protective face masks against viral influenza transmission found no significant protection against or reduction of viral transmission of influenza among infected and uninfected individuals.

We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility

Masks are to protect other people from the wearer, not the other way around.

Virus particles are smaller than masks pores, meaning that they penetrate the mask and the virus is not airborne, so all measures are pointless and only a false sense of security...

But its cool to see how many people fell for that ‚Äúprotect the others‚Äù narrative... you can be told whatever by the so ‚Äúcalled‚Äù experts and would believe it.

Even more confounding, the study‚Äôs analysis indicates that crowded, dense locations are associated with lower coronavirus death rates.

The below information discusses cloth / face masks for generalized use in public as a proposed means of preventing viral infection.

Please don't conflate this with filtration masks like N95 respirators and higher intended for use by medical professional in hospital or similar environment.


Cloth/surgical face masks overview:

Cloth masks designed to protect wounds, blood splatter etc. Not designed as respiratory protectors - no viral filtration - for context one requires an electron microscope to view viruses. A cloth mask trying to filter viral particles is the equivalent of a soccer net trying to filter sand. No fit or seal on the face Prevents regular filtration through the nose due to imposed new breathing habits when wearing a mask. https://omft.info/en/news-posts/nasal-breathing-as-a-defense-against-the-corona-virus/


No regulation of quality of cloths Inconsistent guidelines for cloth/surgical mask wearers.

Nagorno-Karabakh falls within the lands occupied by peoples known to modern archaeologists as the Kura-Araxes culture, who lived between the two rivers Kura and Araxes.


Nagorno-KarabakhThe ancient population of the region consisted of various autochthonous local and migrant tribes who were mostly non-Indo-Europeans.[12] According to the prevailing western theory, these natives intermarried with Armenians who came to the region after its inclusion into Armenia in the 2nd or, possibly earlier, in 4th century BC.[13] Other scholars suggest that the Armenians settled in the region as early as in the 7th century BC.[14]

In around 180 BC, Artsakh became one of the 15 provinces of the Armenian Kingdom and remained so until the 4th century
In 1823 the five districts corresponding roughly to modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh was 90.8% Armenian.[53][54]

Was already in the process of writing this post but with the recent eU news, I decided to finish it now. I am probably going to echo a lot of what other pros and influencers have already said.

Viewership is down overall on all esports titles - this is not just a siege issue. The lack of global competition leads to repetitive games in regions and people get bored of seeing the same 4 teams play each other over and over. Its not all Ubisoft‚Äôs fault however, there are issues that can be solved. 

The scheduling of games. Moving the playdays around so EU doesn‚Äôt play straight into NA, avoiding NA‚Äôs later start time for Europe. Making the NA times earlier would make it more accessible to a larger audience as NA starts at 1/2am for anyone on this side of the world. 

Actual game issues. The boring meta and people not wanting to watch people clear utility for 2 mins every single round. It does get very boring and repetitive fast. I myself am finding it hard to continue to watch EUL. Ubisoft is still yet to publish anything about these issues or act on the issues that people are talking about. It‚Äôs taken 6 months for Ace/Melusi to finally get nerfed, but it‚Äôs not enough - IMO they‚Äôre still very strong. Shields are still on operators that are picked 100% of the time... Just simple changes like moving shields off Wamai and Smoke could make a world of difference, but still nothing.

The Regional Systems

With the switch from ESL to FACEIT, every region got its own system for how to rank each team in a region. LATAM has BO2, NA has BO3, and EU got BO1 with no OT. Viewership wise EU has the best system with each playday every team plays once. In my opinion, if EU added OT it would be the best system overall for viewership and the next best thing to BO3. The greatest issue with the NA system is that if one of the biggest teams in the region is not playing on a specific day, there are so many viewers not tuning in because DZ or TSM is not playing at all. I‚Äôm not against each region having a different format - other esports titles do the same, and it works very well as each region needs a system that works for the needs of the teams as it will not be the same globally.

The eUnited situation... They got very fucked with the current NA system. I am unable to give an exact date for when eU‚Äôs next game is but it is a really long time from now. That amount of time for a team to not compete in anything is not good at all. NA does not have any other regional tournaments to help develop/support a T3 scene like in EU that eU could potentially play in. The system mainly favours the top teams as they have constant games and can make the most money. For middle of the pack teams there‚Äôs very little money in Siege (this is for EU too). T2/T3 teams in the pilot program must wait until the start of next year for their skins to even be released. That is so much money to be missing out on in the meanwhile.

Orgs are not going to be wanting to pick up any bottom of the board teams with the threat of relegation still on the table. Tempo either just have or are reluctant to move their team to Vegas because they‚Äôre last in the league and could get relegated. It‚Äôs a lot of money for an org to invest and very little return or protection for NA teams unless you‚Äôve got big names in your team or a large brand and make content with or sell merch.

The R6 Esports team

~~The guy who ran the Ubisoft esports department (the same guy hyena called out on twitter) was fired and there was no one to replace him and keep his grand vision for what the r6 esports scene could be.~~ Because he was fired a lot of the esports team quit or moved on to other titles. Behind the scenes the department has been left extremely understaffed and they have to run the whole of r6 esports, one of them unfollowed every single R6 pro because he doesn‚Äôt like what the pros say( I can see why but surely not every pro complains 24/7 on twitter). Not sure how you expect to run an esports department and not follow a single professional in the scene.

R6 introduced the pilot program a year ago and the T1 teams just got their skins released. Like I said earlier T2/T3 teams have to wait until next year to get their skins in the game. This means so many teams could be making so much more money to help cover costs of salary. One of the requirements to be eligible is you have to be T1. With ubi adding more and more teams to the pilot program it‚Äôs going to be hard for orgs to keep their spot in T1 without franchising. This forces teams that drop to T2 to drop their teams and buyout the team that took their spot, so they keep the money from the pilot program. With the old vitality skins in the first edition of the pilot program when they dropped to CL the skins were removed from the store instantly.

I‚Äôve been told by pros that their orgs are talking, and the main topic is that they‚Äôre struggling to see the future in the game; the silence from Ubisoft isn‚Äôt helping at all. Even in the pro discord for reporting cheaters, the last time a dev confirmed that they‚Äôre looking into the reports was a month ago. eU was the first of many to leave the scene and I don‚Äôt blame them at all for doing so.

Omdat hij wegens de corona-maatregelen zijn familie in de Verenigde Staten niet kon bezoeken, bedacht Pete Hoekstra (67) deze zomer een alternatief. Hij stapte op de fiets en maakte een reis door de Nederlandse provincies.

Wat je dan zoal leert? ‚ÄûDat de betrekkingen tussen Nederlanders en Amerikanen bijzonder hecht zijn en hartelijk. De mensen die ik ontmoette begonnen niet over politiek, maar over de oorlog en de bevrijding, over hun reizen naar de VS, over hun contacten daar en hun zakelijke activiteiten. Allemaal heel positief. Wat mij zorgen baart is dat in de media een beeld is gecre√´erd alsof Amerika onder president Trump geen betrouwbare bondgenoot zou zijn. Daar is geen sprake van: wij zijn misschien wel betrouwbaarder dan ooit. Zo werken we met Nederland nauw samen op de gebieden van veiligheid en terreur, de veiligheidsdiensten wisselen informatie uit, we hebben hechte economische betrekkingen en we delen allerlei opvattingen over cultuur en identiteit. Onze relaties zijn heel hecht. Het zijn ook de VS die een sterkere NAVO willen. Wij willen bovendien een intensievere handelsrelatie met Europa en we willen samen optrekken met Europa tegen de uitdagingen die China opwerpt.‚Äù

**Het beeld van de Verenigde Staten onder Trump is in de Nederlandse media in het algemeen negatief. Hoe kijkt u daarnaar?**

‚ÄûMijn wortels liggen in Groningen, waar ik ben geboren, en wij komen al heel lang in Nederland. Ik heb persoonlijk diepe wortels in het conservatieve denken en al onder de presidenten Reagan en Bush begreep ik: Nederlanders houden niet van conservatieven. Reagan vonden ze een cowboy en een acteur, ze maakten hem belachelijk; Bush junior werd eveneens belachelijk gemaakt. Ik accepteer dat dit de realiteit is. Nederlanders zijn wie zij zijn, we gaan hen echt niet conservatiever maken. Maar als ambassadeur probeer ik wel de Amerikaanse boodschap uit te dragen, via grassroots bijeenkomsten in verschillende regio‚Äôs en met verschillende politieke partijen.‚Äù

**Dat laatste valt kennelijk nog niet mee: de recente historische doorbraak in het Midden Oosten ‚Äì de Abraham-akkoorden, waarin Isra√´l en enkele Arabische landen de relaties normaliseren ‚Äì werd in sommige media afgedaan als een ‚Äôdiplomatiek succesje‚Äô.**

‚ÄûDaar las ik inderdaad weinig over, tot mijn verbazing. Deze vredesakkoorden zijn baanbrekend en zullen enorme impact hebben op de regio en op de wereld. En het lijkt erop dat er nog meer aankomt, mogelijk een akkoord tussen Isra√´l en Saoedi-Arabi√´. Dat is absoluut huge. Drie jaar lang is onderhandelaar Jared Kushner, de schoonzoon van de president, belachelijk gemaakt: wat kan die nou bereiken, hij heeft geen enkel benul van buitenlandse politiek, was de teneur. En ineens bewerkstelligt Kushner de grootste diplomatieke doorbraak sinds 1979 doordat hij het aandurfde om het conflict van een heel andere kant aan te vliegen. Daar zou je meer lof voor verwachten.‚Äù

**U hamert, net als uw president, veelvuldig op het gevaar van China.**

‚ÄûJa, China zit stevig in onze hoofden. Hun illegale handelspraktijken bedreigen dagelijks Amerikaanse en Europese banen en ondernemingen. Elke dag komen we met de Europeanen dichter bij een begrip van de dreiging uit China. We hanteren misschien verschillende tactieken, maar ik zie een groeiend besef tussen de Europese Unie en de VS dat we een gemeenschappelijk probleem hebben. De volgende stap is: ok√©, laten we geco√∂rdineerde maatregelen nemen, want de VS kunnen dit niet alleen. Wij hebben 330 miljoen inwoners, de EU 445 miljoen, met het Verenigd Koninkrijk erbij is de economie van de EU groter dan de Amerikaanse. China heeft een bevolking van, hoeveel, 1,4 miljard mensen! We willen allemaal met China handeldrijven, maar alleen onder eerlijke voorwaarden en met eerlijke spelregels. We moeten ons goed realiseren dat Amerikanen en Europeanen op cruciale thema‚Äôs, waaronder ook het respect voor de democratische rechtsstaat, veel dichter bij elkaar staan dan Amerikanen en Chinezen of Europeanen en Chinezen. Dat verbindt ons.‚Äù

**Over het respect van Donald Trump voor de verkiezingsuitslag als hij mocht verliezen, maken sommige Nederlandse commentatoren zich zorgen. Zij vrezen dat hij niet zal opstappen.**

,,Zoiets heb ik ook begrepen, maar die gedachte is volstrekte nonsens. Ik weet niet waar de suggestie vandaan komt, maar de president heeft een contract met het Amerikaanse volk onder de constitutie en dat loopt na vier jaar af. Mocht Trump verliezen, dan gaat hij weg. Dan krijgen de Verenigde Staten een nieuwe president. Zo eenvoudig is het.‚Äù

**U zei ooit: op het gebied van islamistische terreur lopen de VS tien tot vijftien jaar achter bij Europa. Wat zeggen de recente terreuraanslagen in Frankrijk u?**

‚ÄûAls voorzitter van de commissie voor de inlichtingendiensten in het Congres had ik al intensieve contacten met de Nederlandse veiligheidsdiensten. Die waren heel goed in het beschermen van de Nederlandse bevolking, viel mij op. Andere landen hadden te kampen met grote terreuraanslagen maar Nederland niet. Ik was van hun werk onder de indruk. Natuurlijk woedt er een verhit debat over wat er in de komende jaren moet gebeuren in de strijd tegen de terreur. Maar kijk wat er al is gedaan: niet eens zo lang geleden was een groot deel van Irak en Syri√´ in handen van Islamitische Staat. Onder president Trump is daar een einde aan gemaakt. Dat is een heel positieve ontwikkeling.‚Äù

**De gemoederen in de VS lijken steeds hoger op te lopen. Bent u niet bang voor meer geweld?**

‚ÄûDe visies die tegenover elkaar staan zijn ook zo enorm verschillend. En hoewel de verkiezingen maar gaan over vier jaar, heeft het presidentschap wel grote gevolgen voor de toekomst. Maar ook toen wij Bill Clinton impeachten was er al sprake van een enorme kloof. Dat was geen gelukkige tijd. En ik herinner me nog die leus ten tijde van de Golfoorlog: ‚ÄôBush lied, our kids died‚Äô (Bush loog, onze kinderen stierven ‚Äì red.). In de Verenigde Staten zijn we eraan gewend om hardball politics te spelen, het gaat er bij ons ruig aan toe. Heel ander dan jullie consensuspolitiek, waarbinnen altijd weer coalities moeten worden gesmeed. Ik kom uit een systeem waarin voortdurend verkiezingen plaatshebben en campagne wordt gevoerd, van burgemeesters en lokale politiechefs tot de president. We weten niet beter.‚Äù

**Op 4 november is corona weg, zei Trump.**

‚ÄûHaha, de president is een bijzonder optimistische vent. Hij wil dingen graag snel voor elkaar krijgen en heeft van alles in gang gezet om zo snel mogelijk een vaccin te kunnen produceren. Overigens, tijdens de coronacrisis is wel gebleken hoe goed wij kunnen samenwerken. Wat het Westen heeft gepresteerd in de afgelopen maanden, de snelheid waarmee we een vaccin zullen hebben, de verbeterde medicatie die we hebben ontwikkeld, dat is ongekend. Neem jullie eigen Philips, dat heeft zijn beademingsapparatuur in de VS versneld kunnen produceren doordat president Trump een oorlogswet uit de jaren vijftig van stal haalde. Die zakelijke relaties waren er natuurlijk al, maar we hebben ze in deze moeilijke tijden snel weten te intensiveren.‚Äù

**Keert u na de verkiezingen terug?**

‚ÄûLaten we eerst maar eens de uitkomst van de verkiezingen afwachten. Maar normaal gesproken blijft een ambassadeur zo‚Äôn drie jaar en die zitten er voor mij bijna op. We gaan nu eerst naar huis, naar onze familie die we wegens corona al zo lang niet hebben gezien en we blijven in de VS om er Thanksgiving te vieren.‚Äù

**Wat gaat u missen aan Nederland?**

‚ÄûDe vele vriendelijke mensen natuurlijk en de schoonheid van het land. Als je op de fiets, in dat trage tempo, door het land reist, valt extra op hoe mooi het is: Flevoland, de Veluwe, Friesland, Zeeland. Mijn ouders spraken altijd over Paterswolde bij Groningen. Ik was daar als kind van nog geen 3, en nu was ik er op de fiets, op een zondagmiddag in de zomer, en reed rond het Paterswoldse meer.

*The 43rd Panzergrenadier-Battalion is a modern-era, NATO (Bundeswehr) vs Russia Cold-War themed unit. We are located in central Europe and have a diverse and friendly international playerbase.*

We don't have a mandatory attendance but would like you to sign out if you know you will not be able to make it. We play on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 2000/2100 CEST.

**What we offer**

*&gt; A new experience involving factions that you‚Äôve likely not played as before.*

*&gt; You are new to Arma 3 or Milsim? No problem! We are looking forward to teach you the things you need to know.*

*&gt; People that will be able to teach you new capabilities all around Arma's possibilities.*

*&gt; Learning new roles. We have experienced Squad Leaders that will train you to lead, we have experienced Milsim medics that will teach you how to properly use the ace medical system to full extense, etc. The range is vast and opens new doors for people looking for a newgrounds.*

*&gt; Plenty of space to progress throughout our ranks as we have a large spectrum of roles from Infantry to Tanking, from Rifleman to commanding officer.*

**Our playstyle**

*We strive to achieve a relatively realistic setting while also having very tight and fun community. This means we are perfectly fine with people having a laugh as long as they can switch back to a serious note once needed. We like to play Operations as tactically and strategically as possible without constant formations and the like. We play in First Person and use Advanced ACE Medical (We can teach you how to use it!).*

**What roles you can apply to**

*Of course no one wants to play a role they do not like, but fortunately you will not have that problem with us. We are still quite small and try to grow as fast as we can. This means you will be able to apply to advanced roles like pilots, vehicle crew, squadleader, teamleader, etc. quite fast. Also if you like zeusing we will probably have a slot for you doing that as well.*

**Requirements**

*&gt; Microphone*

Both Poland and Turkey were suppose to grow to great power status while the United Kingdom Italy and France would fall behind relative to their current status at the time. If you noticed, in reality both France and Germany have grown while both the Anglo sphere , the East Asian sphere, and the new great powers have lost. You pose an interesting comment, and worthy of research of what was going on in foreign affairs at the time of Edrogans election. Especially the United States and France would be worthy of studying. Maybe this was a power play by Germany and France, to the benefit of Russia as well. A great power in Poland and Turkey would limit or destroy their influence in Eastern Europe. I absolve the United States of knowing what Edorgan was, mostly because America only benefits from a stronger Poland/Turkish state. 

I also need to explain France and Germany so I am not downvoted to oblivion. French and German leadership have always been suspect of an American led world, with good reason. However they do not want a strong Russia, but rather a strong Europe. Poland and Turkey being great powers would do more damage to that vision because of nationalism in new world powers usually being stronger. Not always but usually. So if that report would have been correct, you would have a split Eastern Europe between Turkey and Poland, with France and Germany relegated into playing a game where American leadership could use Poland and Turkey to outweigh any French-German alliance inside the EU, thus making the EU a tool of the Anglo sphere or having an incoherent strategy between international rivals. 

Russia is also easy to explain, they want a strong enough EU to fight the US, but not strong enough to meddle in Russia 
‚ÄòS sphere of influence. So Russia has been pushing right winged society in both Poland and Turkey weakening them, while France and Germany have only made moves on paper to counter these moves. So why has n‚Äôt the United States tried to counter the Russian moves in either of these, either under Obama or Bush? Simple- no one cared. I think it‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious that America is sliding back to isolationism since the end of the Cold War. Whether that‚Äôs good or not is up to the reader. A multipolar world often means more conflict, but a unipolar world often means less mobility for nations. Of course you can also say that a Stronger more independent EU fits with in that vision of an isolation of the US. Allowing the traditional Western and central EU powers to dominate the affairs allows for a predictable and quiet Europe. 

So in conclusion, I-have little doubt that most of the intelligence agencies knew what edrogan was both politically and economically, but the real questions really are at the diplomatic level- who did or did not make moves to counter him and to what capacity.

Don't like reality, huh?

&gt;Two in three British Muslims would not give police terror tip-offs

behind a paywall before it goes into the detail of the survey.  I don't buy it.

&gt;Poll: 40% of UK Muslims want Sharia

Sharia isn't legal law.  Sharia is ""go to the mosque for a marriage contract"" to most Muslims.  Or personal law.  The survey itself is bias in it's questions.

&gt;Muslims in Britain have zero tolerance of homosexuality, says poll 2009

Just like many other religious groups.  They polled people at the mosque, when they polls Muslims outside of the mosques in France:

&gt;By comparison, 35% of French Muslims found homosexual acts to be acceptable

which follows a lot of the same patterns found in almost all religious groups.  Also, ""acceptable"" means a lot of things.  You can think it should be legal, but not accept it as a practice.  Muslims are no different from most westerners, who only about 50% of which started accepting homosexuality in the last 2 or so decades.

&gt; after a poll of 300 showed 80% saw nothing wrong in jihad, or holy war, against non-believers.

This is a bias question in itself.  the way Europeans see ""jihad"" is vastly different from the way Muslims do.  A ""jihad"" against non-believers implies the non-believers are trying to stop Muslims from being Muslims.  ""Jihad"" literally means ""struggle"", not ""holy war"" as the article claims.  This is why pregnancy and labor is considered a ""jihad"".  This is why literally going to work is considered a ""jihad"".  

&gt;52% of Sweden Muslims believe that Sharia is more important than Swedish law. 2015

All religious people believe their divine rules are more important than government rules.  This isn't unique to Muslims.  

&gt;Six out of ten mosques in Sweden gave women advice about how to deal with spousal abuse and polygamy that contradicted Swedish law, a media investigation has revealed. 2012

People are allowed to try to solve their problems with their communities and families before going to the law.  This is normal across ALL societies, including secular and atheist ones.

&gt;62 percent of Turks in Germany say that they prefer to be with Turks only. Almost half (46 percent) would like to see more Muslims than Christians living in Germany at some point.

This is also the same of every other people.  Germans prefer to be with germans.  Atheists prefer there were more atheists in their countries.  

&gt;42 per cent of Canadian Muslims believe the contrast between the West and Islamic cultures was irreconcilable.

CULTURES, not religion.  Islam has already westernized across the world.  There are mosques that accept the LGBT people, mosques that lecture in the native tongue, etc.  Yes, the culture of say, the Saudis doesn't mesh with the culture of Canadians.  But immigrants become the the native culture in just 1 generation.

&gt;So many memers doing these studies, right?

yes, you applied your memes to the studies to promote your bias.  You're insisting this is a problem with Islam or Muslims in general, and it's not.  You're insisting very human issues are worse when Muslims do it, and twisting surveys to fit your own bias.

&gt;Muslims are integrating/assimilating to western societies as fast as anybody else... right? You are a clown.

&gt;For instance, the vast majority of U.S. Muslims say they are proud to be American (92%), while nearly all say they are proud to be Muslim (97%). Indeed, about nine-in-ten (89%) say they are proud to be both Muslim and American.

&gt;Alan Manning and Sanchari Roy, economists at the London School of Economics, kick-started the literature on cultural assimilation with their 2007 paper testing whether Muslim immigrants in the U.K. assimilated any more slowly than other immigrants. Maybe, they conceded, policy interventions were needed if cultural assimilation of some groups was not fast enough. 

&gt;They concluded, however, that ‚Äúwe find no evidence for a culture clash in general, and one connected with Muslims in particular.‚Äù In other words, Muslim immigrants assimilate no slower than do any other immigrants.

&gt;Rigorous studies in other countries are unfortunately sparse. A study by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka looking at religiousness and other indicators of difference between Muslims and non-Muslims across Europe led the authors to conclude that ‚Äúdifferences[‚Ä¶]will continue to diminish‚Äù and that the data ‚Äúshows signs of convergence over time.‚Äù The sociologist Sabine Pokorny conducted a representative survey of immigrants in Germany for the CDU-affiliated Konrad Adenauer Foundation. She paid special attention to Muslim immigrants. Again it was found that assimilation was coming along apace and, interestingly, that Muslims were not more religious than Christians in Germany.

&gt;In 2014, German men between the ages of 14 and 30 made up 9% of the population and were responsible for half of all the country's violent crimes.

&gt;When it comes to the new arrivals, men aged 16 to 30 made up 27% of all asylum-seekers who came in 2015.

&gt;""It is because of the demographics,"" claims Dr Dominic Kudlacek, from the Criminological Research Unit of Lower Saxony. ""Whether they're asylum seekers or EU migrants, they are younger than the average population and mostly male. Young men commit more crimes in every society.""

""Black"" is absolutely not meant *specifically* for african americans. You can just as well call any african black. White literally just means european or of european descent. It's really, truly, not a difficult concept to grasp and I think you're being wilfully ignorant in not seeing it. The ""concept"" of being white didn't start anywhere because it's not a fucking concept, it's just reality. Some people ARE white, some people ARE black, some people ARE asian. This is observable reality, clear as day. 

The genetic differences between races *are* small in some areas. Generally speaking we are very similar, though as pointed out things like skull shape, melanin content, average height, hair colour and texture, etc are observably different. The main area where we differ is in IQ. The **average** (and this word is important) IQ of Ashkenazi jews tends to be the highest, followed by east asians, then whites, then hispanics and then blacks at the bottom. Whether you like it or not, IQ is one of the current best predictors for future success, and black people (and hispanics) generally have very low IQ's. This means that they don't integrate well into societies that place more importance on intelligence and the ability to perform intellectually. This is observable reality; majority black countries are shitholes and are almost unanimously third world (yes, even places that haven't been touched by any form of colonialism) and white countries are first world. There's also the issue of crime rates, which pretty much on-the-dot match IQ averages. Blacks commit vastly disproportionate amounts of crime wherever they go and hispanics commit a lot of crime too. Literally just look at FBI crime statistics, I don't have to read them out for you. Regarding black americans specifically, there is a large percentage of them that have the MAOA 2 gene that has been linked to aggressive and impulsive behaviour. 

The point of all this is that blacks are genetically pre-disposed to being more stupid, aggressive and impulsive than other races which links perfectly with how much crime they commit. Ergo they don't mesh well with western society and societal values. I can go on but you've likely heard all this before and are just unable to comprehend it. Also, your ""Sapiens"" link isn't a source of any kind. It's basically an opinion piece with some dates thrown around. No studies, no data.

I really, truly don't know how to explain to you how retarded you sound when you ask why it sucks to become a minority in your own country. Seriously, the only way I can explain you asking this question is if you yourself are not white (and therefore stand to benefit from becoming a more powerful majority in white countries), or if you're some self-hating white liberal college student who has been fed bullshit for 18 years.

I think this framing is acceptable because you would be hard pressed to find anyone in the current shadow cabinet admittig the prevalence of antisemitism within labour doesn't exceed that of the general population. 

The intention behind mentioning this fact isn't to downplay the hurt and fear of discrimination felt by the jewish community by the minority of labour members that somehow remained active for so long, but to counter the right wing press narrative that has successfully led the general public to believe 1/3 of labour members were under investigation for antisemitism. It is not fair to have to submit pver and over again, feeding the perception that labour is the antisemetoc party when time and time again we have had labour zionists and jewish intellectuals and academics come forward and claim  that this scandal has been blown out of all proportions for political reasons. 

That doesn't mean any jewish complainant is a bad actor(I don't think even 1% of them are) but that authoritative and prominent likud associated publications and community members have used the scandal to refer to Corbyn and his allies as the greatest threat to British Jews since Hitler and Enoch Powell, stirring up an already deeply traumatised community who can be forgiven for being extremely cautious. Which is a gross lie and heinous utilisation of the memory of the holocaust for political reasons(those reasons being to block the ascension of a Palestinian sympathiser to the highest office of one of Israel's most powerful allies) made by the far right religious wing of the UK zionist movement - which is of course a UK ally of Likud. Where people like me, and those who believe the things I do would normally advocate for the Labour zionist movement. You can question my intentions behind referring to these organisations and people all you like.

The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI, and as Operation Z during its planning. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353[15] Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 4] and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. The surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[18][19] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, ""a date which will live in infamy"". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.Ôªø",True,False,False,,,,0,1604251233,,False,0,{},gat4mtj,False,t3_bvvfqg,False,True,t3_bvvfqg,/r/u_MalboMX/comments/bvvfqg/try_suicide_guy_on_steam/gat4mtj/,False,,1615948676,1,True,False,u_MalboMX,t5_cb7kc,u/MalboMX,user,,0,[],

Just forbid immigrants from getting welfare. That's how the Arab oil states currently work: they take a portion of the oil money and dole it out to native citizens, so they can be fat lazy and happy, having to do no work of any kind (and don't revolt against the monarchy) and then they bring in scads and scads of foreign ""guest workers"" who do all the work in the country and get no welfare.

The US already has laws on the books forbidding legal immigrants from receiving most forms of means-tested welfare. Why then can't we have open borders and immigration at the same time, if immigrants are barred from receiving welfare?

Secondly: how do you propose we abolish the welfare state? Do you know how popular Social Security is among Americans? How about Medicare? 

You'll find super-majorities of voters support the continued existence of these programs, super-majorities oppose *any* reform or reduction of these programs, and a slim majority would make them *even more generous.*

Saying ""We need to abolish welfare first, then open the borders"" is just a smokescreen for ""We should never open the borders, so we can have a perpetual welfare state.""---carrying water for Progressives and Conservatives alike! A libertarian should be ashamed of such a thing.

Voters like welfare. It's an unbreakable cycle. You steal voters' money in a hidden way and then give some back in an ostentatious way, thus convincing them perpetually of the need for welfare and how good and beneficial welfare is. The only way to get rid of welfare is either to go bankrupt (but even here, as we've seen in Greece or Venezuela, voters continue to demand welfare even as the country literally goes bankrupt).....*or* to change the demographics of *who* is receiving welfare.

Open the borders first, and the abolition of welfare will follow. It makes perfect sense, because more homogeneous societies have, on average, [more generous welfare states.](https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d19/d1972.pdf) Why? Because people support welfare only if they think their money is being taken from themselves and being given to people similar to themselves. When you bring in a bunch of damn dirty foreigners into your country, support for welfare declines. When people perceive welfare as mainly benefiting an out-group instead of their own in-group, they are more likely to oppose welfare.

When asked about budget cuts and what government program needs to be reduced or eliminated, why do you think Americans consistently name foreign aid as the No. 1 choice? Why do you think Americans think foreign aid comprises 10% of all spending when it's less than half of one percent?

Why do you think Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society"" coincided with the moment in American history when immigration to the US was nearly at an all-time low and the percentage of foreign-born people living in the US *was* the lowest it has ever been in US history?

Why do you think the US refrained from building a welfare state in the 1900s, when we had open borders, and yet all the European countries were beginning to construct welfare states?

Americans, and most people, are prejudiced against outsiders and intrinsically resent the idea of having their tax money taken from them and given to an outsider. Furthermore, if we have open borders, then we can get conservatives to get serious about abolishing welfare. Currently, conservatives actually *like* welfare and, in a way, are the biggest defenders of the welfare state. Open the borders and that will change, because their No. 1 priority will be trying to stop those ""damn dirty foreigners"" from coming here at all, and in their warped world-view, they think welfare is the main reason why immigrants come here.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604251736,,1604260768,0,{},gat5ljz,False,t3_jm0a0k,False,True,t1_gat2kli,/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/jm0a0k/trump_is_both_abusing_his_power_and_not_doing/gat5ljz/,False,,1615949142,3,True,False,Anarcho_Capitalism,t5_2qorf,r/Anarcho_Capitalism,public,,0,[],

My place is limited to an L shape, 2.40mX2.30m. My scale is HO and I'll use old Marklin M track, because that's what I have and I actually like those (also, I don't want to invest in new track).

I'm not interested in switching operations, I mainly want a nice layout to run my trains in a not-too-boring way, and to make a nice scenery over the time. It'll be a European scenery, quite rural, but without a very precise era because I have trains from a BR81 to an ICE :)

If you guys have any suggestion, I'll be happy to take some ideas !

This would be done in stages from Labrador to the UK, via Greenland and Iceland. There are more refined plans for a line from Iceland to Europe, and this would probably have to be built well before a connection to Labrador is ever considered. Iceland has the potential for excess clean power, and the political and financial apatite in Europe, both from the public and private sectors favour getting off fossil fuel energy. With Germany on track to decommission their nuclear plants in the near future, they are ramping up coal generation as a stop gap.

Of course it would be much closer and easier to export to the US, but there's a possibility for both in a perfect world. The demand peaks of North America and Europe differ by 5-6 hours so there is a pretty large window in which Newfoundland could sell clean power to meet demand. This would also make a strong case for building Gull Island.

Director: Francis Ford Coppola

&gt; This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name. A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. In Britain, Dracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 58 critics with an average rating of 6\.6\/10\. The site's consensus reads, ""Overblown in the best sense of the word, Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Bram Stoker's Dracula rescues the character from decades of campy interpretations‚Äîand features some terrific performances to boot."" Vincent Canby described the film as having been created with the ""enthusiasm of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master's command of his craft."" Richard Corliss said, ""Coppola brings the old spook story alive...Everyone knows that Dracula has a heart; Coppola knows that it is more than an organ to drive a stake into. To the director, the count is a restless spirit who has been condemned for too many years to interment in cruddy movies. This luscious film restores the creature's nobility and gives him peace."" Alan Jones in Radio Times said, ""Eerie, romantic and operatic, this exquisitely mounted revamp of the undead legend is a supreme artistic achievement...as the tired count who has overdosed on immortality, Gary Oldman's towering performance holds centre stage and burns itself into the memory.""

Africa did have wheels, even earlier than Europe in some parts, but wheels really aren't that great.

In Europe's mild climate, it's easy to maintain roads, but in Africa's harsh climate and terrain, wheels are useless. Add to that that the continent has a massive jungle in the middle, and massive deserts, and it's easy to see why wheels didn't catch on. So they did have wheels, they just abandoned them because they are useless in Africa.

Similarly, Africa did have written languages and cities, but most got destroyed during colonialism.

Lots of reasons. Look at America. If the Native Americans had resistance to smallpox, they'd probably still own this land. Or if you reversed the diseases, and the Natives gave untreatable infectious disease to the Europeans, they may well have conquered the Old World. 

Having immunity to smallpox isn't like some function of brainpower. It's luck. 

Likewise, for centuries Poland was overrun by the Mongols, while England wasn't. Is that because England had some super smart Mongol-fighting technology? No. They're just farther away from Mongolia. Whether or not a country got conquered by the Mongols has very little to do with brainpower and much more to do with 1) proximity to Mongolia, 2) water barriers between you and Mongolia and 3) mountains between you and Mongolia.

That's it.

So yeah, if human intelligence was the only way to become the 'greatest country on Earth' then sure, you'd make a lot of sense. But that's usually not the case.

I completely disagree with a lot of this! Maybe this is just from the perspective of an FSO, and maybe you lived in different places than I did, but I wanted to just give another opinion on a couple of the things you said.

1. Generally wages are higher in places that are more expensive. You talk about Switzerland will bankrupt people, but I don't know anyone making less than 20 CHF/hr. My friend working at a gas station earned 25 an hour.
2. I agree housing here is on a different scale than many other places, but the obvious reason for that is that we have a lot less space in Europe. This is a drawback, but saying that smaller places mean lower quality of life is not an opinion I agree with. A lot of people raise families in apartments.
3. VAT changes depending on the country. In Italy, it is 22%, in Germany 19% but in Switzerland it is only 7.7%. This also only applies to stuff like electronics, etc, food and drink is taxed at a way lower rate. Usually prices are higher due to the exchange rate, but taxes have little to do with the bottom-line price usually.
4. Europe wasn't built with cars in mind. Public transportation and biking are the normal ways of getting around here. My experience with these things has been a lot better than yours. In CH everything is immaculately clean, in Germany everything is also very clean, and France/Italy are far from what I would describe as dirty. Public transport is also no longer confusing in the age of smartphones, where all the information is available on Google Maps/the respective transport apps. The transportation is also very punctual.
5. Using the term ""underdeveloped"" to describe a lack of air conditioning is grossly overstating the reality. In France, Spain and Italy (the warmer places) I have yet to be anywhere without A/C. In CH and Germany, it is not required, because it is only hot enough for it a couple weeks out of a year.
6. My experience with medicine here has been great. I have always gotten great doctors and my wait has never been long. The only bad experiences I have had were in Germany, and that is because instead of completely socializing the medicine they have a stupid system in which private insurance is more accepted than the public option.
7. Hospitals have the same, if not better tech and techniques than in the USA. I had a knee surgery in the US a couple years ago, and when I went to the doctor in Germany for a checkup he laughed, saying the technique they used had not been used in Germany for 10 years.

However, the austerity measures were counterproductive and if the goal was for Greece to reform its institutions sustainably and pay back its debt, the ECB, IMF, and the EC did the equivalent of trying to put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it. 

Probably the best illustration of this is that Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio [rose from 126.7% to 175.2% from 2009 to 2011](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en) on account of the austerity measures that [reduced Greek GDP significantly](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=GR) and therefore made the debt problem worse as lower consumption and incomes on account of the tax increases and public spending cuts resulted in a [decrease in government revenue](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REVGRC). All the austerity measures did was lead to widespread suffering and unemployment for the Greek people, it didn't help Greece reform its institutions of the structural factors that caused the crisis to occur and it actually made it *more difficult* for Greece to pay back its debt. 

To draw a comparison to the U.S. and the current economic fallout from COVID-19, imagine if there was an external body that prevented the U.S. from passing the CARES Act and any and all other forms of fiscal stimulus, and handicapped the Federal Reserve to prevent it from engaging in any form of open market operations (Greece, as a member of the Eurozone, had no independence in setting monetary policy), and not only that but we were forced to raise taxes and cut spending at the same time people were losing their jobs en masse and would thus have less of a means to support them during the downturn.

First, go to scryfall.com and browse legends by typing in ""t:legend t:creature"". You can look on scryfall for a bunch of other modifiers if you've already got an idea. 

Once you've picked a commander it's time to set a budget. Whatever you feel like spending you can make it work. I've built decks for less than 5 dollars, they're not the best, but they can still be fun. 

Okay, now I would go to edhrec and startup a deck list on another site like untapped. Just start throwing in cards that you think are cool. Don't worry about the budget yet, or going over 100 cards, just throw stuff in. Scryfall is also useful here, let's say you wanna look at cards for [[teysa karlov]], start digging with a search term like ""o:die commander:WB t:creature"" to find cards that have death triggers and are the right colors.

Okay, next I think about the manabase. Conventional EDH wisdom says you should probably have around 37 lands in the deck. And unless you're mono colored you probably don't wanna play all basics. Scryfall is super helpful if you're on a budget, you can type in ""t:land usd&lt;5"" for all lands less than 5 dollars. Whatever number works. Then sort the cards by their edhrec rank. Pick a bunch of lands till you've got a decent looking manabase. Make sure to leave maybe 2-5 basics of each color in though.

Okay, now we start thinking what we'll need. This deck's more flavour than flame, so we're gonna take a look at the massive list of potential cards you've already made. Firstly sort them into these categories. Ramp, spot removal, board wipes, card advantage, endgame, other. Strategy depending, you want 2-5 board wipes, 3-7 spot removals (spot removal should be either efficient i.e. path to exile or versatile i.e. anguished unmaking, not so much value generation). You want maybe 7-12 ramp sources, there's plenty to find in edhreca top cards list https://edhrec.com/top. Next we want some card generation i.e phyrexian arena, this can be anywhere from 2-10 cards strategy depending.

All EDH decks need all of those things. You fill those up, and then you start adding in your spicy cards. Ideally you find cards that are in budget, fit the role and have synergy with your commander. Then start cutting to fit budget and card limits until you have something. Finally, export your deck list to txt and stick it into an online store like cardmarket.eu for european or tcgplayer for americans (many alternatives exist).

&gt; 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Europe&amp;#039;s new COVID-19 cases have doubled in five weeks, propelling the region on Sunday across the bleak milestone of 10 million total infections, according to a Reuters tally.

&gt; While Europe almost took nine months to record its first 5 million COVID-19 cases, the next 5 million cases were reported in slightly over a month, according to a Reuters analysis.

&gt; Within the region, Eastern Europe has nearly one-third of the total reported COVID-19 cases, the highest number of cases, while Southern Europe leads the death toll with about 32% of the total coronavirus-related deaths in Europe, according to a Reuters analysis.

When people criticize racism in western europe or the usa. You see that's as criticism against ""white people"" or western culture. Because you look at the world through that lense.   

You use racist logic to explain the crimes of certain  black individuals as somehow reflecting some kind of characteristic intrinsic to some fictional idea of ""black identity"" .

When people talk about racism in western europe. Then obviously ""white"" people will get most of the blame. Because they are the majority and hold the most power. That's just a fact. Not some kind of conspiracy made to attack people of a certain skin colour.

&gt;The untold story of a heroic band of Caribbean pirates whose defiance of imperial rule inspired revolt in colonial outposts across the world. In the early eighteenth century, the Pirate Republic was home to some of the great pirate captains, including Blackbeard, ""Black Sam"" Bellamy, and Charles Vane. Along with their fellow pirates‚Äîformer sailors, indentured servants, and runaway slaves‚Äîthis ""Flying Gang"" established a crude but distinctive democracy in the Bahamas, carving out their own zone of freedom in which servants were free, blacks could be equal citizens, and leaders were chosen or deposed by a vote. They cut off trade routes, sacked slave ships, and severed Europe from its New World empires, and for a brief, glorious period the Republic was a success.

I have been working from home since March and so the isolation is really starting to kick in with the restrictions.  I live on the outskirts so don‚Äôt get into town much but last week I cycled to Leith and can‚Äôt believe the number of people around.  Stockbridge was also hellish.  

I booked a week of annual leave just as Nicola Sturgeon announced the current circuit breaker a few weeks ago.  Gutted as I had been working long weeks for the months running up to it and needed to get out and enjoy myself!   But glad we did.  Watching England once again go into a lockdown too late is frightening. It‚Äôs going to be a long winter.  

The US election has myself (and my friends) nervous right now as a Trump victory would not be good for our ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù trade deal post Brexit in January.  Also what happens in the US tends to cross the Atlantic.  The shift to more right wing and fascist views are worrying.  Though when trump announced Farage as the ‚ÄúKing of Europe‚Äù it made me chuckle- I think that was the last thing Farage would ever want to be called! It just shows Trumps lack of geopolitical awareness.

Oh, et quand on dit ""lib√©ral"", ""conservateur"", ""d√©mocrate"", ""r√©publicain"", leur significations ne sont absolument pas les m√™mes en France qu'aux USA.

Pour √ßa, lire le sublimissime texte de R√©gis Debray, ""[√ätes-vous D√©mocrate ou R√©publicain ?](https://www.les-crises.fr/etes-vous-democrate-ou-republicain-par-regis-debray/)"", o√π on s'aper√ßoit qu'aux USA, les R√©publicains sont en r√©alit√© d√©mocrates, et les D√©mocrates sont en r√©alit√© r√©publicains...

Cela dit, pour revenir au Japon, toute soci√©t√© est profond√©ment ancr√©e dans sa culture, laquelle est form√©e par l'Histoire, qui est fa√ßonn√©e par la g√©ographie (pas moyen d'√©chapper √† l'Histoire-G√©o!).

Une soci√©t√© Anglo-Saxonne sera individualiste (lire ""petite-bourgeoise"") et √† terme, puritaine.

Commen√ßons avec l'Angleterre, que je comparerai √† la Doulce France.

On a du monde pris sur une petite √Æle assez pauvre, en comp√©tition avec (pour la noblesse) la M√®re Patrie (le regrett√© prof. Robitaille de l'institut de Recherches Nucl√©aires* de Saclay disait ""L'Angleterre est une colonie Fran√ßaise qui a mal tourn√©""...). √âtant tr√®s pauvre, cette √Æle a t√¥t du commercer avec l'√©tranger, voire √† √©tablir des colonies. Comparativement, la France, ce doulx pays de cocagne a toujours eu ce dont elle avait besoin, et n'a donc pas d√©velopp√© cette mentalit√© petite bourgeoise.

Durant l'√¢ge des d√©couvertes, l'Angleterre a √©tendu un empire colonial (que la France n'a sing√© que parce que c'√©tait √† la mode) rapidement devenu indispensable √† sa survie. Et la mont√©e du protestantisme et ses valeurs ax√©es sur l'ancien testament, dont notamment la responsabilit√© individuelle a entra√Æn√© une hausse d'influence pour la bourgeoisie, qui s'enrichissait constamment.

Faisons un moment un pas en arri√®re, en 1215, quand une poign√©e de barons v√©reux ont arrach√© √† un roi faible, Jean Sans-Terre (j'ai eu, une ann√©e, un instituteur nomm√© Robert Santerre), la ""magna carta"", qui √©tablissait des droits pour les nobles tout en sapant l'autorit√© du roi et de l'√âtat. Rien de tel en France, o√π le roi pouvait proclamer sans rire ""l'√âtat, c'est moi!"". Alors, petit √† petit, la notion s'est faite que les ""droits"" des barons pouvaient √™tre progressivement √©tablis √† tout le monde, du moins ceux qui peuvent se permettre de payer pour faire respecter ses droits. 

C'est ainsi que la bourgeoisie a pu compl√®tement subvertir le gouvernement Britannique. On peut le voir par leur syst√®me √©lectoral o√π, jusqu'il y a un si√®cle environ, seuls les propri√©taires terriens poss√©dant plus d'une certaine valeur (qui m'√©chappe et dont j'ai compl√®tement la flemme de rechercher vu que √ßa a pas vraiment rap) avaient le droit de vote.

C'est ainsi que les Anglo-Saxons, dont l'√©volution sociale a pu prendre tout son essor aux USA, sont devenus une soci√©t√© tr√®s petite-bourgeoise, o√π les individus sont responsables d'eux-m√™mes. 

Cette soci√©t√© petite-bourgeoise en est venu a absolument d√©tester les pauvres, car les consid√©rant d√©nu√©s de morale (sans morale, on ne travaille pas, d'o√π pauvret√©), et en tant que tels, ils doivent absolument √™tre punis, d'o√π la myriade de lois sp√©cialement √©dict√©es contre les pauvres. On y trouve le paroxysme aux USA o√π les pauvres sont absolument submerg√©s par les amendes donn√©es par un syst√®me punitif √©rig√© par l'administration (par exemple: on ne peut pas payer son assurance, hop! contredanse! Il faut passer au tribunal, mais si on se pr√©sence, on perd son boulot. Et hop! Mandat d'arr√™t, et quand on se fait alpaguer, hop! Prison, tant qu'on ne paye pas les amendes dues. Et pour empirer les choses, beaucoup de prisons font payer leur s√©jour aux d√©tenus!!!)

Par contre, les riches ont toute la latitude voulue pour exploiter leurs employ√©s, car les lois cens√©es les prot√©ger ne sont, √©videmment, pas claironn√©es sur les toits, mais pour entreprende une action, il faut se payer un avocat.

Aux USA, le racisme a toujours √©t√© utilis√© pour diviser la population.

Dans une telle soci√©t√©, les pauvres blancs ne sont pas porter √† voter √† gauche, parce que la propagande leur fait croire que la gauche va les taxer pour donner aux noirs qui ne foutent rien; cette m√™me propagande qui leur fait croire que si ils ""travaillent fort"", ils vont devenir millionnaires.

C'est un syst√®me extr√™mement pourri par une mentalit√© rapace et √©go√Øste qui, √† cause de la magna carta, en vient √† penser que les individus sont plus importants que la Soci√©t√©, et que les riches ont raison, parce qu'ils sont b√©nis par Dieu car ils ont la moralit√© requise pour travailler beaucoup plus que les pauvres.

Une autre constante d'une soci√©t√© Anglo-Saxonne est l'assomption imm√©diate que l'√âtat est mauvais, que le gouvernement est inapte et que tout ce qui vient de l'√âtat doit √™tre vu avec la plus extr√™me suspiction.

L'aboutissment logique est une administration compl√®tement d√©ficiente et incomp√©tente, car les gens intelligents travailleront pour eux-m√™mes, ou pour une compagnie qui les r√©num√©rera √† leur juste valeur. 

C'est diam√©tralement oppos√© √† la France et ses Grandes √âcoles, et o√π travailler pour l'√©tat n'est pas consid√©r√© comme une tare sociale. Ce n'est donc pas √©tonnant que la France, comme √©tat, soit g√©r√©e plus efficacement; je mettrai en exemple le TGV, produit pas la SNCF et tout son r√©seau de polytechniciens qui ont su produire le TGV, qui a montr√© au monde que le chemin-de-fer n'√©tait pas un cul-de-sac technologique, comme la pens√©e bagnolarde et avionneuse des ann√©es 60 le faisait penser, mais une technologie promise √† un bel avenir.

35 ans plus tard, la Chine avait plus de 10,000 kilom√®tres de lignes nouvelles √† grande vitesse; l'une d'elle que j'empruntais r√©guli√®rement se targue m√™me d'avoir le plus long viaduc du monde: plus de 160 kilom√®tres!

Ce n'est pas pour rien que les USA et les Rosbifs ont des r√©seaux ferroviaires archi-nuls: l'entreprise priv√©e qui y domine, adepte de la solution la moins ch√®re √† court terme, n'aurais jamais accept√© l'investissement √† long terme n√©c√©ssaire.

Par exemple, la SNCF a enti√®rement financ√© elle-m√™me le TGV sans la moindre aide de l'√âtat. Une fois la ligne Paris_Lyon ouverte, il n'a fallu que NEUF ANS pour repayer le co√ªt des 30 ann√©es de recherche n√©c√©ssaires pour mettre au point la technologie, l'achat des terrains n√©c√©ssaires, la construction des voies-ferr√©es et l'achat des rames de TGV. Depuis 1990, donc, tout le fric qui rentre dans les poches de la SNCF avec le TGV sont du profit pur et simple. Quand on raconte √ßa √† au p√©kin lambda Amerlok, son cerveau ne peut absolument pas comprendre, parce que son cerveau a √©t√© engraiss√© √† la propagande petite-bourgeoise o√π n'importe-quoi qui appartient √† l'√âtat ne peut rien faire de bon.

Ce qui m'a le plus fait rire, ce sont les autobus Londoniens exploit√©s par... la RATP! Suite √† la privatisation des transports, le march√© a √©t√© pris par la RATP, cr√©ature √©tatique par excellence; c'est pour dire non-seulement l'incomp√©tence des haut-fonctionnaires rosbifs, mais √©galement des entrepreneurs priv√©s, qui se font damer le pion par une compagnie appartenant √† l'√âtat Fran√ßais!!! Et la SNCF tire aussi son jeu dans ce march√© l√†.

Et maintenant, la gangr√®ne petite-bourgoise envahit la France et pourrit toutes les institutions en les subvertissant une apr√®s-l'autre, et le paroxysme est atteint sous Maqueron qui veut mordicus instaurer un syst√®me petit-bourgreois directement calqu√© sur les Amerloks.

J'ai vraiment peur pour la France o√π la menace islamique fait compl√®tement le jeu des bougreois en instaurant une peur que les islamo-gauchistes ne seront jamais capable de venir √† bout, vu leur insistance √† ne pas comprendre la menace islamique et leur aveuglement qui ne les fait plus conspuer l'opium du peuple.

You‚Äôve created a bit of a straw man here‚Äîwho has said that criticism of Islam should be banned? 

Second, among Islamic scholars who prohibited and punished blasphemy, they themselves made a distinction between criticism of religion and blasphemy.

A Christian who calls Jesus the ‚Äúson of God‚Äù has made a blasphemous statement from the perspective of Islam. But Muslim scholars have defended their right to do so, since they are allowed to practice their religion. Meaning, simply making a statement that is in contradiction to Islam is not ‚Äúblasphemy.‚Äù There is also a long tradition going back to the founding of Islam of actively debating people of other religions, which implies that those non-Muslims will necessarily make ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù statements. But this is protected speech under shariah law. Point here simply being that the issue is not really about protecting the right to criticize a religion, but about a certain type of speech. 

The current backlash is against intentionally antagonistic and insulting speech, such as the caricatures of Muhammad. French Muslims are a vulnerable minority in France‚Äîpoor, segregated, and largely the descendants of former colonial subjects‚Äîare actively discriminated against, antagonized, and limited in their practice of their religion (French secularism, which is very strict). 

To ignore the social and political context‚Äîand place the debate in a sanitized arena where different groups are on equal footing‚Äîis to ignore the root of the issue. There is a perception‚Äîright or wrong‚Äîthat the West is at war with Islam and Islamic values. France was the last European power to relinquish control of its Arab colonies, and was arguably the most brutal‚Äîactively suppressing Islam and destroying mosques. Last month Macron announced a massive crackdown on the Muslim community‚Äîthat was before the latest cartoon-related attack. This is the context in which these cartoons are made, and this is the context in which people are angry about them. 

And it‚Äôs hard to argue that these cartoons and other racist, denigrating speech is not fueling violence and discrimination. A healthy society is one where people can share their opinions but also one in which the racial and religious majority is not using the media and organs of the state to assault a religious and ethnic minority. 

There is also tension between the individualist perspective‚Äîwhere there are no communities but only individuals with varying identities‚Äîand the communitarian one. Individualists break down hate speech and free speech based on whether it is focused on an individual or group. A man who calls all African Americans the N-word is using free speech; but a man who calls a specific individual African American the N-word can be punished for using so-called ‚Äúfighting words.‚Äù 

But people who are part of a minority group might perceive attacks on the group as an attack at the individual level. It‚Äôs easier for one who is in the majority to separate themselves from the group; an individual in the minority doesn‚Äôt enjoy the same privilege.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604265175,,False,0,{},gatx7kh,False,t3_jm4k4i,False,False,t3_jm4k4i,/r/changemyview/comments/jm4k4i/cmv_blasphemy_or_criticism_of_religion_is_not/gatx7kh/,False,,1615962238,13,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,1,[],

Por que h√° mais homens gays do que mulheres gays? Conversei esses dias com meu psic√≥logo sobre esse assunto por cima, e acho que o que realmente acontece √© que se d√° mais ""holofote"" para os homens gays do que para as mulheres, j√° que um relacionamento entre dois homens choca mais a sociedade, um pouco diferente de um relacionamento entre mulheres. N√£o estou dizendo que mulheres l√©sbicas est√£o isentas de ""chocar"" a sociedade, mas nossa sociedade j√° enxerga as mulheres como pessoas ""naturalmente"" mais afetuosas do que homens, por isso algumas coisas podem passar despercebidas. O impacto parece ser maior entre homens.


O mesmo pode se aplicar √† quest√£o das mulheres e homens trans. N√£o √© porque se fala menos em homens trans que necessariamente h√° menos homens do que mulheres trans, s√≥ n√£o h√° a mesma ""visibilidade"" talvez. Uso a palavra visibilidade entre aspas porque o que ocorre n√£o √© bem uma visibilidade de mulheres trans, j√° que muitas vezes elas s√£o retratadas de forma c√¥mica/estereotipada, mas elas s√£o mais retratadas e conhecidas do que os homens trans.


Um relato pessoal como exemplo: eu nunca tinha ouvido falar sobre homens trans. Sempre achei que eu era uma menina l√©sbica de trejeitos masculinos. S√≥ com meus 18 anos (uns 5 anos atr√°s) √© que ouvi falar no Tumblr pela primeira vez e fui pesquisar mais sobre, e s√≥ depois disso √© que eu descobri o que eu realmente era. Foi estranho no come√ßo, me autodenominar como ""trans"" porque, pra mim, s√≥ existiam mulheres trans (e daquele jeito estereotipado ainda).

Initial Process : 

Upon acceptance of IG request, got verified with ID selfie (all but name &amp; DOB redacted); directed to text a number to text for meetup appointments in NE DC.

Service Review : 

IG and Text reps were both punctual and friendly, answered questions on strains and donations without judgement. Meetup was speedy yet efficient, and Entourage was flexible around travel schedule. No delivery fee, no mix match fee (within same tiers), no service fee. 

As an added bonus, for the first meetup Entourage provided a complimentary king-size pre-roll gift üéÅ which contained Grape Ape üçáüêí. Surprise favorite, keeping my eye out for that one next time. This is how prerolls should be done, generously packed, expertly rolled, with flower selections from their lineup instead of with shake or stemmy by-product. 

Overall positive first &amp; second meetup experiences (1 week apart), overall customer service is good, I would rank it below DC Direct, DistrictFlorist, BBB &amp; DC Dabbler in terms of meetup flexibility, accessibility, response speed &amp; friendliness. 

Flower Review : 

Entourage's flower quality was certainly impressive across the board considering its West Coast imported nature, but overall they weren't as fresh or as pungent as locally sourced flower. 

On my first run, I tried four flavors in the bottom two tiers: Bubba &amp; Blueberry Cough in Premium (40/70/130/240) and Lemon OG &amp; Creamsicle in Top Shelf (50/90/160/280). 

For my second run a week later, I settled on their NYC Sour Diesel in the Exotic Tier (60/110/200/380). 

Ultimately, I would rank them numerically in the following order : NYC Diesel &gt; Bubba &gt; Creamsicle &gt; Blueberry Cough &gt; Lemon OG.

Bubba was a great value pick, BB Cough &amp; Creamsicle were nice, Lemon OG was just ok. The NYC Diesel, while really nice flavor, imo belongs in the Top Shelf tier; at nearly 400 a zip, it doesn't beat DF's, DC Dabbler's, or BBB's flower at similar price points. At least with those three, they run smaller, more focused operations, so I trust the QC/QA to ensure the flower is organic and PGR-free. Best comparison I can draw for NYC Diesel is DCD's Runtz Jack &amp; Runtz offerings from the other month, which were priced at around 60/120/150/300 &amp; 65/130/175/350, respectively. Emphasis on maximizing bag appeal &amp; aroma over potency, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

In Heathenry, moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse sagas. Evoking a life-affirming ethos, Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor, courage, integrity, hospitality, and hard work, and strongly emphasize loyalty to family. It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word, particularly sworn oaths. There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility, and a common motto within the Heathen community is that ""We are our deeds"".

https://i.imgur.com/85tkZXX.png

I can log in and have the address automatically taken from my address list or I can select a country other than Japan in the drop-down list. Previously I could also set the country to Japan by entering a valid Japanese postal number, for example 100-0001 for the imperial palace or 100-2100 for [Okinotorishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinotorishima) and various other uninhabited islands. It's no longer possible to enter a Japanese postal number and Japan does not appear in the drop-down list. How do I set the address to Japan without having to log in?

I need to set the address to Japan in two situations. First, there's an issue with Amazon being unable to send books to Europe if the weight is unknown and the weight of pre-order books is always unknown. The shipping cost depends on the weight and the shipping cost is unknown if the weight is unknown. The search engine won't find books which Amazon won't ship internationally unless I set the country to Japan. I want to be able to keep track of soon to be published books and if it's a limited edition then I may have to order it to a freight forwarder instead as it could sell out before the weight becomes known to Amazon.

Secondly, if I'm ordering used items, then Amazon won't list marketplace sellers which don't ship to my country. Unless the items are fulfilled by Amazon, I need to send them to a freight forwarder anyway and then it doesn't matter if they ship to my country or not. Due to high costs for the postal service to submit a customs declaration, I need to combine multiple small items to a single big shipment using a freight forwarder so that I don't pay the postal service's customs clearance handling fee more than once. The few sellers which are shown, if any, often charge high prices.

The first problem can be solved by using a Japanese proxy server or VPN. If it's a product which has an ISBN, I could find the item from a different shop, convert the ISBN-13 to ISBN-10 format and manually create an Amazon URL. However, both solutions are unnecessarily cumbersome.

I don't want to use a VPN to hide my country of residence in the second situation as I'm worried that Amazon could suspect fraud if the IP address belongs to a VPN. I don't wish to log in until I'm placing the order as it's much easier to empty the shopping basket (if I add the wrong item to it) if I'm not logged in. Then I can simply clear all cookies and the shopping basket is empty. If I'm logged in, then I have to click on a delete link for each item.",True,False,False,,,,0,1604268376,,False,0,{},gau3jce,False,t3_jicl3z,False,True,t3_jicl3z,/r/amazon/comments/jicl3z/weekly_help_and_discussion_thread_for_the_week_of/gau3jce/,False,,1615965234,1,True,False,amazon,t5_2qjnx,r/amazon,public,,0,[],

I live in south east Asia.  Grew up in Europe. Am Chinese.  Growing up everyday we had bone broth, either chicken or pork with vegetables. Every meal would be rice and other dishes. Salt fish, fried fish, stir fry vegetables, stews, there‚Äôs meat in everything. Mostly chicken and pork and fish.  With my parents we never had lamb, sheep, hardly ever beef (only few times per year).  We were kind of poor.  We didn‚Äôt have fast food. 
Every meal had meat, once a week we would have a whole snapper fish, a whole chicken and a book size piece of belly pork with the ribs on.  This is for 9 people but 7 were kids. We didn‚Äôt roast or bake anything, the oven was never used. Everything was either steamed, boiled, stir fried or stewed.  We never really had anything deep fried either. For snacks we would have peanut butter or jam sandwiches or cereal but I never saw my parent eat these things and we never had curry at home. Food was flavoured with salt, soy sauce, msg and fish sauce. Ginger, garlic and spring onions were the herbs.  Strangely growing up we didn‚Äôt really have any tofu because we couldn‚Äôt buy any, the chineseshops were pretty far. My dad went shopping weekly and bought can food, milk, bread and cereal from the supermarket and everything else from the outdoor market. We had fruit after every meal. 

Now, I eat fast food as a treat. Have biscuits and chocolate in the house.  Meals are porridge, fruits, smoothies, coffee.  Pasta, stir fries, rice, curries (we never had curries as a kid). Mash potatoes meal, roast potatoes meal. I try to limit vegan sausages and nuggets etc.  
I don‚Äôt have to have designated breakfast foods for breakfast, I can have noodles and curry and pizza for breakfast. I live with western partner so that would influence my home food, i like to cook meals they miss and/or can‚Äôt buy easily.  We bake cakes because it‚Äôs hard to find vegan cakes here. 


 I never would have thought I would go vegan but I read some books and oh - that‚Äôs not good at all! And made a change.  I tell my dad not to eat meat, he says he doesn‚Äôt eat much.

Maybe there's something to be said about class or historical trends of colonization and cultural loss we can talk about when it comes to African and indigenous populations but to describe it as in terms of just whiteness also takes away a lot of the picture. For example, epigenetics might explain some aspects in terms of a heightened stress response over generations of those trends I talked about above---and if you've ever been anxious then you know that you too would have a certain attitude if it meant the protection of your self esteem. Maybe the indigenous/black folks who survived colonization were the ones who fought back and focused on themselves and their local communities, which would be a selective pressure to distrust white people and to have a self-first approach to problem solving. We just don't know until we do more research. Your explanation ignores how lighter skinned people end up being treated as better, expected to act of a ""higher class"" than browner folks, and your Eurocentric examples don't justify the rest of your arguments. 

For a counter example I think of Cuba, a place i've been to. The majority of the population is black, very black with little Europeans or indigenous folks that I could see. The historical reasons are twofold: the Indians were wiped out and their DNA barely survive through admixture, and white landowners fled the country when the communist revolution happened. This is where we get a large segment of the ""Latinos por Trump"" people, and why American Cubans have little in common with Cubans on the island. You also massively underestimate the impact of racism and larger Eurocentric ideals, as culture implicitly teaches children that people who look a certain way (like them) do not go far in life. It's the reason that I, as a mestizo man who passes for white, still struggle with hating some of my indigenous features and my racial ambiguity. My lips and my nose point to a history that not a lot of Americans like to think about, which was the enslavement and cultural erasure of indigenous communities under New Spain. Genocides and hispancization even within the past century guarantee that I will never know which of my ancestors were black or indigenous.

Split the country into Group A and Group B. Make sure half the employees at any given location are in each group, accounting for those who have two employees in a single household. Register them all in a central system so there's consistency per household.

Send each household a letter confirming which group they're in, even make a unified checker available online that confirms which group you're in without any need for a login etc. Make it public information.

For two weeks, absolute lockdown of anyone in Group A. Not allowed to leave the house except for absolute emergency. They all get given priority booking for online shopping, contact numbers for help during that period, etc.

After two weeks, switch groups, but anyone who has developed symptoms must keep isolating for 10 days from symptoms start (as per govt guidelines).

Rinse and repeat for Group B.

Do this with enough advanced warning, say, four weeks after the letters and website go live, with.the obvious prep time for forming the groups etc.

Yes. This should be fairly obvious since northern peoples (now) often have higher genotypic IQ and higher quality environments.

&gt;I saw someone a few months ago talk about how europeans were smarter than africans because they were in a ""cold climate"" 

It's due to a multitude of evolutionary reasons. This isn't as simple as 1 cause. We know for example that the cold winters theory can't be the only cause since selection still impacts intelligence while CWT predicts selection has stopped.

&gt;I know that the difference in IQ between races nowadays is due to the environmental reasons
