B: Characters that were explicitly white in the source material got cast to black actors. Which is a great opportunity- because adaptations don't technically owe anything to their source material- to inject some diversity and diverge from the source material to create an original work but just the fact that this sounds great tells me they wont commit to it and will instead just sit there with a dumb look on their faces while they insist that the character can be black and completely missing the point. 


C: At one point they were genuinely considering making characters that really shouldn't be black, black for no clear reason. As in, ""My dad's white as bird shit, and my mom's from a blood line of people who are basically humanoid mayonnaise so of course I'm black, why do you ask?"" no reason. 


And they did this in lieu of fleshing out the lore for an element of the universe that isn't well explained- Witcher's extended lore describes an explicitly African coded continent, and we already have people who are basically coded as Middle Eastern- and building a reason for what would compel brown and black people to move to the ass-end of racist Europe. Like, we know how Turks ended up in Germany- they came as cheap labor after the Second World War. We know how Indians speak English- there was that whole Colonial affair.

This is the exact racism and alarmism I am talking about. Economic migrants are not refugees. 

&gt;Why is that portion of the Convention along with the requirement to seek asylum in the first safe country so quickly cast aside?

Why isn't there some right to self-determination? 

&gt;Most in Spain, Italy, and Greece yes but refugees in Northern and Western Europe typically travelled over land across borders to claim asylum in more desirable states. Those people are no longer refugees, they are economic migrants.

So, you are lumping economic migrants in with refugees but then saying they are distinct. (which they are)

&gt;Refugees should be properly claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.

Yes, or apply for refugee status in a country of their choosing prior to leaving. And those that do not follow the laws should be and are denied asylum. 

&gt;Further to that, the international community needs to step in and start putting its foot down (and offering support) to countries, particularly in the middle east, that refuse to accept refugees. 

The West supports them by funding their wars and supplying their weapons. That is a great idealistic view and something that we should strive for but does absolutely nothing in the short term. When there are literal boatloads of actual refugees (and not economic migrants) who are showing up daily.

The Norway–Russia border barrier is an international border barrier built by Norway on the Norway–Russia border. Construction of the barrier began in September 2016 and took a few months. The intent of the project was to prevent the smuggling and illegal crossing of migrants from the Middle East, mainly from Syria, who have used Russia as a route of entry into Norway (and thus into the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone).

**Inner German border**

The Inner German border (German: Innerdeutsche Grenze pronounced [ˈɪnɐdɔʏtʃə ˈgʁɛntsə] or Deutsch-deutsche Grenze pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃɐˌdɔʏtʃən ˈgʁɛntsə]; initially also Zonengrenze pronounced [ˈtsɔnənˌgʁɛntsə]) was the border between the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) from 1949 to 1990. Not including the similar and physically separate Berlin Wall, the border was 1,393 kilometres (866 mi) long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.

It was formally established on 1 July 1945 as the boundary between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of former Nazi Germany. On the eastern side, it was made one of the world's most heavily fortified frontiers, defined by a continuous line of high metal fences and walls, barbed wire, alarms, anti-vehicle ditches, watchtowers, automatic booby traps, and minefields.

Also, if you were a Catholic ruler, the Church could excommunicate you and that would mean you could now be a target. Example :

&gt;When King John of England refused to accept Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury, he seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Pope Innocent III first sent a commission to negotiate with the king, and when that failed, place the kingdom under interdict. This prohibited the clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and last rites for the dying. King John responded by taking more church lands and their revenues. **Innocent threatened the king with excommunication and in 1209 proceeded to excommunicate the King**. Papal legate Pandulf Verraccio served John with notice of his excommunication in the summer of 1211. **The excommunication absolved the King's subjects from their oaths of allegiance, gave the Barons reason to revolt if they should so choose**, and allowed the King of France a pretext to invade England to remove John from power.

OB Prince of Zenobia- Same situation as above, but never got a translation patch yet.
Recommend emulation via SNES9x or Retroarch, if using a PS Vita
                 
OB64- For 3 limbs and a liver, you can probably get an original copy off Ebay. Same as above, got a Wii and Wii U release in JP and EU, but the US didn't get it. Supposedly some US versions will still download it anyway, but I haven't been able to borrow a Wii to check, meant to do that last week.

Knight of Lodis- Unlikely to get ported or remade, but runs on dang near anything. God dang this thing deserves a remake or sequel.
GBAsp (PSP, Vita), Retroarch (Vita, PC), My Boy! (Android), or just about anything will emulate it without problems. 
                          
LUCT (Old)- SNES or PS1, both of which will run you a preposterous amount of money. Release on the Japanese Playstation store allegedly, but we never got it here. PS1 version is drastically more stable if you're into challenge runs. SNES version has the CV mod.
SNES9X or Retroarch works fine, standard ISO emulation works for the PS1 version. 
                    
LUCT (New)- Available for PSP, Vita, and PSTV for $9.99. That took a while. Japanese version features 10x higher stat growth, but reduced crafting rates and...kinda improved AI, which also spends a billion years buffing. 
Download off PSN, or use a hacked verison of any of the above. Android also has emulators. OV mod works fine with all of the above as well.
                                 
To be frank, this series is obscure enough that I doubt the legality of it will ever be an issue.

&gt; Initial disputes concerning gas debts and non-payment appeared immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union.[citation needed] As a result of disputes over non-payments by Ukraine, Russia suspended natural gas exports several times between 1992 and 1994. This led to the illicit diversion of Russian natural gas exports from transit pipelines by Ukrainian companies and institutions in September 1993 and November 1994.[citation needed] The diversion of gas was acknowledged by Ukraine, while accusations of other diversions were disputed.[18]

...

&gt; A serious dispute began in March 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit. During this conflict, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation,[2][3] but later Naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached a high point on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory.

...

The system has eliminated some risk for the organisations with an intended trickle-down effect on the players, notably increasing the upper end of salaries. 

However in terms of NA rookie development, there probably isn't enough pointers toward definitively coming to the conclusion that either system particularly contributes to the development of NA rookie talent. 

Similar to when Challenger series was around there are usually one or two teams that are a clear distinction above the rest and it is debatable whether the natural skill progression of Challenger/Academy level players wouldn't have carried over to the same level of the level visible in the present, because it is a hypothetical. 

Also thinking it out logically can give rise to different conclusions based on the outset. 

E.g. ""when asking about a league dedicated to rookies and giving rookies experience or a league dedicated to imports and bottom tier veterans?"" predicates that the intent of franchising was for the rookie development and not a direct result of Reginald and co.'s organisations pressure to make the e-sport a finance and US organisation viable ecosystem. Also the beginning of the NA LCS franchising brought about the EU version of the 'korean exodus' and would have potentially happened again had not the LEC increased the spending power of European organisations by adopting the same model. Going off of the attraction of the safe-havens that western Franchised systems provide, they appear to be more-so a league dedicated to imports than their predecessor. 

Also, as mentioned previously, something currently being observed by Sebastian Park while the roster enquiries, mentioned in Hotline League, is that there seems to be a drowning out of middle-class wage/talent in the NA LCS and not the bottom. Leading to the 'Either you're a star-player, rookie (not necessarily even NA, referencing Broken Blade) or low-wage/skill tier. 

So one could also ask: A league dedicated to wage and skill inequalities or a league of uncertainty in many ways?

I will say, I agree that franchising is less flawed than the relegation system and it's good the move was made. It provides stability in many aspects. However it can be argued that this is for the organisations and that the total net benefit to the players in many aspects is arguable and uncertain until the system has been around long enough to draw proper conclusions.",True,False,False,,0,1543638341,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eau2nr2,False,t3_a1ujkl,True,t1_eatzkq9,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/a1ujkl/the_amount_of_midlane_rookie_talent_coming_into/eau2nr2/,,1546266020,1,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,[],text,False,

The network that airs Big Brother in Canada, and the production company that produces it, probably can't even do a deal with BBUS without involving Endemol in Europe.  That's my guess anyway.  It's probably much more complicated than the Canadian show saying ""hey, purchase the rights to air us in the USA"".

Another thing that people don't understand about the networks that have aired BBCan, is that GlobalTV and SliceTV fall under the same big corporation.  Originally it was Shaw Communications, but they were purchased by Corus Entertainment, I believe in Season 5.  Slice is a pay channel on cable with a very small audience, while Global is an over-the-air channel with a much wider reach.

When people say that the show was better on Slice, or Slice should make the show again, that means absolutely nothing.  Insight Productions is the company that has made the show through the entire run.  On Global, BBCan now has a much wider audience, and sponsorships now play a major part of the program.   It can never go back to cable because the audience will disappear, because Slice has such a small reach.

None are correct, none are wrong. I worked as a therapist to the elderly and although I don't have all the answers, I'll share my approach in hopes it helps you somehow.

A. So you don't want to go to the doctor.  Ok. I get that. I can think of a thousand ways I'd rather spend my time. But here's the deal. You aren't 20, 30, 40, whatever anymore and you now have health problems. So you have two paths. Go to the doctor, spare a few hours of this very long life, to make sure everything is as good as it can be so you can continue doing the things you love. A few hours here and there can ensure you live life to the fullest. I mean, think of all the time we waste in life, whats a few hours spent ensuring your life is as good as possible? Or, path 2, let your health conditions go unmonitored. CHF can lead to shortness of breath, dependence on oxygen, inability to walk, dementia, sudden death? Do you want to risk that? How many places are you going if you can't breathe and your legs are swollen?

No sale?

B. I respect your decision. I understand it takes a lot of time to prepare, the doctor is usually stressful, (or whatever fits) so here's option B. We can get a nurse to come to the home. *You may have to visit the proper doctor one more time to get this referral, depending on insurance. If you live in the EU, this should already be an option.* That way, you don't have to leave, waste much time, or get gussied up, and you still get to keep your goal of looking after your health so that you can live the best life possible.

No sale? 

C. What can I/we do for you? I'm worried about you because your conditions have some serious consequences and I can't predict how things are going or how they'll play out without a doctor's advice. What is your goal? What does your future look like? How are you going to get your prescriptions refilled? What do you want us to do if you get critically ill and...well... are suffering?

At ""C"" some people will fold and go for options A or B. Some will give you their final wishes (in that case, respect how they want to spend their final years). Some will be so far in denial they won't admit any of this is necessary.  If the latter...

D. Call whatever social service agencies are available in your state/area for the aging. Again, I'm US...so here we have a specific agency for aging in each state. You/your mom will get assigned a caseworker.  This person will help you. You need to plan for the worst and you need additional support coming in to try to reason with her. Sometimes people won't listen to family, but invite a friendly stranger over to say the exact same stuff you've been saying and suddenly it all makes sense. They never thought of it that way. Lets go to the Dr. Don't take it personal. 

There's also the possibility mom doesn't have a good connection with her doctors. I'm assuming she has a cardiologist, probably the most important one at this point. Figure out if she even likes the person and their staff. If so, trouble shoot with them. My mom can't stand waiting around. Her oxygen gets low and she's cranky in general. They try to schedule her at times there should be no problem getting in. They don't lecture her *too* hard about her diet. They do things to ensure she keeps coming back.

All I really knew of him was that he was the 41st President and previously President Reagan's VP. He may not have been the greatest, but many believed him to be a decent person. In asking this question I found a fantastic (and very long) article by the New York Times that expands on why many American approve of the 41^st president as well as his faults;^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/george-hw-bush-dies.html)

&gt;As the elder Mr. Bush watched troubles envelop the eight-year presidency of his son, however, what had been a source of pride became a cause of distress, friends said. The contrast between the two President Bushes — 41 and 43, as they came to call each other — served to burnish the father’s reputation in later years. As the younger Mr. Bush’s popularity fell, the elder Mr. Bush’s public standing rose. Many Americans came to appreciate the restrained, seasoned leadership the 41st president had displayed; in an opinion poll in 2012, 59 percent expressed approval. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, praised the father as a way of rebuking the son.

&gt;It was a subject Mr. Bush avoided discussing in public but one he finally addressed in conversations with Jon Meacham, his biographer, in a book published in 2015. Mr. Bush was quoted as saying that his son’s administration had been harmed by a “hard line” atmosphere that pushed an aggressive and ultimately self-destructive use of force around the world, and he placed the blame for that on men who had long been part of his own life and who became key figures in his son’s orbit — Dick Cheney, his son’s vice president, and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his son’s secretary of defense, with whom the elder Mr. Bush had feuded.

&gt;“I do worry about some of the rhetoric that was out there — some of it his, maybe, and some of it the people around him,” Mr. Bush said in the Meacham book, “Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.”

&gt;He was particularly critical of Mr. Rumsfeld. “I don’t like what he did, and I think it hurt the president, having his iron-ass view of everything,” he said, adding, “Rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow and self-assured, swagger.”

&gt;Mr. Bush and his sons did not attend the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate in 2016, and he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton.

&gt;...Mr. Bush was president during a shift in the world order that had begun under Reagan. His measured response to upheaval in Eastern Europe drew complaints that he was not seizing the reins of history. But he chose a collaborative approach, working with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to allow for the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The two leaders signed treaties mandating historic reductions in their countries’ nuclear and chemical weapons.

&gt;...His signal domestic decision was almost certainly the 1990 budget deal, which sought to address deepening deficits by raising taxes on the wealthy. If it helped put the nation back on solid financial footing, it nevertheless reversed one of the most explicit campaign pledges ever uttered by a major-party presidential candidate: “Read my lips. No new taxes.”

&gt;...*A Measured Aristocrat*

&gt;By any yardstick, Mr. Bush was an aristocrat, a product of moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he was instilled with an enduring sense of noblesse oblige.

&gt;As a candidate, he was known to ask his Secret Service detail to stop at traffic lights. He wrote enough thank-you notes, courtesy cards and letters of sympathy — Mr. Bush seemed to know someone in every town in America — to fill a book, literally.

&gt;That book’s title was his customary signoff, “All the Best, George Bush.” Published in 1999, it appeared in lieu of a traditional presidential memoir, which he thought would be unseemly for a man whose mother, Dorothy W. Bush, had taught him the importance of modesty.

It seems like most of the 'information' that you have gathered to build your notion of what America must be like to live in is in fact based on things that you may have seen or read in the news media. And I do not blame you. Only bad news sells and that is what CNN and other outlets make their living off of.

But until and unless you have lived here personally (and no anecdotes from your relatives or friends don't count), you do not have the right to judge what living here must be like. Yes , living in US has its downsides, such as relatively higher crime rate compared to Europe and Australia but there is nothing else, not a single freaking thing that makes US less desirable to live in than other countries including Nepal. The US state of California has a higher GDP than the entire country of Russia. The state of Texas has a higher GDP than Australia. You know what that means right? The career or job opportunities that you can get in the whole country of Australia is available just in the state of Texas. You're talking about having healthier food options in Nepal?

There's at least one public wartime assessment of Allied tanks by German troops This from the 27 June 1943 of the (Goebbels-founded) German weekly newspaper ""Das Reich."" It was later reproduced in a US Army Tactical and Technical Trends bulletin for the benefit of American officers. So, it's been filtered through quite a bit of military bureaucracy and propaganda.

http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/enemy-tanks.html

But for all that, it's an interesting read (imo, it makes it even more interesting, given its assessment of the Sherman). 

There's a bit of tank-based pop psychology: ""[the German tank testing officer] contends that the various types of tanks reflect psychological traits of the nations that produced them."" 

It's rather harsh on French tanks: ""The French have produced a number of unmaneuverable but thickly armored ""chars"" embodying the French doctrine of defense. They are conceived as solid blocks of iron to assist the troops in rendering the solidified defensive front even more rigid.""

It's bit more charitable to British tanks: ""English tanks of the cruiser class come much nearer to satisfying requirements of a proper tank for practical use in the present war."" But it's not too generous: ""The English tank is an Africa tank. It has a narrow tread chain. It did not come much into the foreground on the European continent. A tank for use in Europe, apparently, is something for which the English don't show so much talent.""

American tanks come off a bit better. The Lee ""possesses commendable motor qualities, its contours are not well balanced, and its silhouette is bizarre and too tall."" But the Sherman gets quite a bit of praise. The writer says it ""must be regarded as quite a praiseworthy product of the North American steel industry."" 

It's given good marks for ""serial construction and fulfillment of the almost arrogant requirements of the North American automobile industry as regards speed, smooth riding, and streamlined contour of the ensemble.""  Other praiseworthy features are that, ""It is spacious inside. Its aeroplane motor is of light weight. It is a series product, the same as its cast-steel coat, the latter being modeled into an almost artistic-looking contour, in such manner as to offer invariably a curved, that is a deflecting surface to an approaching bullet."" The gun stabilizer gets special attention as an ""imposing innovation.""

All in all, the Sherman of 1943 is said to ""represent the climax of the enemy's accomplishments in this line of production."" Not too bad, eh?

The T-34 is also given good grades. The author even says, ""the T-34 used by the Russians at the opening of hostilities in 1941 was at that time the best tank produced anywhere."" 

Of course, since this is a propaganda piece, the propagandist has to let the Germans win at the end, by saying, ""in Tunis, German soldiers have demonstrated their ability to deal with this tank [the Sherman]."" 

But here's the part I find really fascinating. Even that optimistic statement in the Nazi's official propaganda mouthpiece gets tempered with another admission. ""But they [German soldiers] know the danger represented by these tanks [Shermans] when they appear in large herds.""

 Feto | Foto: Thinkstock Nas últimas duas décadas, dezenas de artigos científicos sobre as origens biológicas da homossexualidade foram publicados – um deles, divulgado na semana passada, reacendeu a polêmica sobre o assunto. Mas como esta constatação se encaixa na teoria de seleção natural de Charles Darwin?

 Na música *Same Love*, que se tornou um hino não-oficial de apoio ao casamento gay nos Estados Unidos, a dupla Macklemore e Ryan Lewis, vencedores do prêmio Grammy de Melhor Artista Revelação na última edição do prêmio musical, ironiza quem diz acreditar que a homossexualidade é fruto de uma ""escolha"".

 A opinião científica parece estar do lado deles. Desde o início da década de 90, pesquisadores vêm mostrando que a homossexualidade é mais comum em irmãos e parentes da mesma linhagem materna.

 Segundo esses cientistas, isso se deve a um fator genético. Também relevantes – apesar de ainda não amplamente comprovadas – são as pesquisas que identificam diferenças fisiológicas nos cérebros de heterossexuais e de gays, assim como os estudos que afirmam que o comportamento homossexual também está presente em animais.

 Mas, como gays e lésbicas têm normalmente menos filhos biológicos do que os heterossexuais, uma questão continua intrigando pesquisadores de todo o mundo.

 ""Se a homossexualidade masculina, por exemplo, é um traço genético, como teria perdurado ao longo do tempo se os indíviduos que carregam 'esses genes' não se reproduzem?"", indaga o pesquisador Paul Vasey, da Universidade de Lethbridge, no Canadá.

 ""Trata-se de um paradoxo do ponto de vista evolucionário.""

 Muitas das teorias envolvem pesquisas realizadas sobre a homossexualidade masculina. A evolução do lesbianismo permanece muito pouco estudada. Ela pode ser semelhante ou muito diferente.

 Os cientistas ainda não sabem a resposta para esse quebra-cabeça darwinista, mas há muitas teorias em jogo e é possível que diferentes mecanismos atuem em cada pessoa.

 Conheça algumas das principais teorias a respeito do assunto:

 Genes que definem a homossexualidade também ajudam na reprodução
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Image caption  O alelo – um grupo de genes - que às vezes influencia a orientação homossexual também pode trazer vantagens reprodutivas. Isso compensaria a falta de reprodução da população gay e asseguraria a continuação dessa característica, uma vez que não-homossexuais também poderiam herdar esses genes e transmiti-los a seus descendentes.

 Há duas ou mais maneiras pelas quais esta transmissão dos genes pode acontecer. Uma possibilidade é que este grupo de genes crie um traço psicológico que torne os homens heterossexuais mais atraentes para mulheres, ou as mulheres heterossexuais mais atraentes para os homens.

 ""Sabemos que as mulheres tendem a gostar de traços e comportamentos mais femininos nos homens e isso pode estar associado com coisas como o talento para ser pai e a empatia"", diz Qazi Rahman, coautor do livro *Born Gay; The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation* (""Nascido Gay, A Psicobiologia da Orientação Sexual"", em tradução livre).

 De acordo com essa teoria, uma quantidade pequena desses alelos aumentaria as chances de sucesso reprodutivo do portador desses genes, porque o torna atraente para o sexo oposto.

 De vez em quando, um membro da família recebe uma ""porção"" maior destes genes, que se reflete na sua orientação sexual. Mas porque este alelo traz vantagens reprodutivas, ele permanece no DNA humano através das gerações.

 Gays seriam 'ajudantes no ninho'
--------------------------------

 Alguns pesquisadores acreditam que, para entender a evolução dos homossexuais, é preciso observar qual é o papel que os gays têm nas sociedades humanas.

 A pesquisa de Paul Vasey em Samoa, na Polinésia, baseou-se na teoria da seleção de parentesco ou hipótese do ""ajudante no ninho"".

 A ideia é que os homossexuais compensariam a falta de filhos ao promover a aptidão reprodutiva de irmãos e irmãs, contribuindo financeiramente ou cuidando dos sobrinhos. Partes do código genético de um gay são compartilhadas com sobrinhas e sobrinhos e, segundo a teoria, os genes que determinam a orientação sexual também podem ser transmitidos.

 Vasey ainda não mediu o quanto que ser homossexual aumenta a taxa de reprodução dos irmãos, mas comprovou que em Samoa, homens gays passam mais tempo fazendo ""atividades de tio"" do que homens heterossexuais.

 ""Ninguém ficou mais surpreso que eu"", disse Vasey sobre suas descobertas. Seu laboratório já havia comprovado que homens gays no Japão não eram mais atenciosos ou generosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas do que homens e mulheres heterossexuais sem filhos. O mesmo resultado foi encontrado na Grã-Bretanha, nos Estados Unidos e no Canadá.

 Vasey acredita que o resultado em Samoa foi diferente porque os homens que ele estudou lá eram diferentes. Ele pesquisou os fa'afafine, que se identificam como um terceiro gênero, vestindo-se como mulheres e tendo relações sexuais com homens que se consideram heterossexuais. Os fa'afafine são parte de um grupo transgênero e não gostam de ser chamados de gays nem de homossexuais.

 O pesquisador especulam que parte da razão pela qual os fa'afafine são mais atenciosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas é sua aceitação na cultura de Samoa, em comparação com os gays no Ocidente e no Japão. A lógica é a de que gays que são rejeitados tendem a ajudar menos os familiares a criarem seus filhos.

 Mas ele também acredita que há alguma coisa no estilo de vida dos fa'afafine que os torna mais propensos a serem carinhosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas. E especula que encontrará resultados semelhantes em outros grupos de ""terceiro gênero"" ao redor do mundo.

 Se isso for comprovado, a teoria do ""ajudante no ninho"" pode explicar em parte como um traço genético da atração pelo mesmo sexo não foi excluído dos humanos ao longo da evolução.

 Mesmo com uma menor capacidade de se reproduzir, homossexuais que se identificam como um ""terceiro gênero"" ajudariam a aumentar a capacidade reprodutiva de seus parentes heterossexuais, ao assumirem cuidados com as crianças.

 Homossexuais também têm filhos
------------------------------

  Image caption  Nos Estados Unidos, cerca de 37% da população lésbica, gay, bissexual e transsexual [ têm filhos](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/lgbt-parenting-in-the-united-states/), 60% dos quais são biológicos. De acordo com o Instituto Williams, casais gays com filhos têm, em média, dois.

 Estes números podem não ser altos o suficiente para sustentar que traços genéticos específicos ao grupo sejam passados adiante, mas o biólogo evolucionista Jeremy Yoder lembra que durante boa parte da história moderna, pessoas gays não viveram vidas abertamente homossexuais.

 Obrigadas pela sociedade a casarem e terem filhos, suas taxas reprodutivas devem ter sido mais altas do que são hoje.

 Medir a quantidade de gays que têm filhos também depende de como você define ""ser gay"". Muitos dos homens heterossexuais que têm relações sexuais com os fa'afafine em Samoa casam-se com mulheres e têm filhos.

 ""A categoria da atração pelo mesmo sexo se torna muito difusa quando temos uma perspectiva multicultural"", diz Joan Roughgarden, um biólogo evolucionista na Universidade do Havaí.

 No Ocidente há indícios de que muitas pessoas passam por uma fase de atividade homossexual, mesmo que sejam principalmente heterossexuais.

 Isso tornaria mais complicado afirmar que somente pais que levam uma vida homossexual poderiam passar ""genes gays"" adiante.

 Nos anos 1940, o pesquisador de sexo americano Alfred Kinsey descobriu que apenas 4% dos homens brancos eram exclusivamente gays após a adolescência, mas 10% dos homens tiveram um período de atividade gay de 3 anos e 37% tiveram relações com alguém do mesmo sexo em algum momento de suas vidas.

 Uma pesquisa nacional de atitudes em relação ao sexo feita na Grã-Bretanha em 2013 apresentou número mais baixos. Cerca de 16% das mulheres disseram ter tido alguma experiência sexual com outra mulher (8% tiveram contato genital) e 7% dos homens disseram ter tido alguma experiência sexual com um homem (5% tiveram contato genital).

 Mas a maior parte dos cientistas pesquisando a evolução gay estão mais interessados na existência de um padrão de desejo interno contínuo. Identificar-se como gay ou heterossexual não é tão importante, nem ter relações homossexuais com maior ou menor frequência.

 ""A identidade sexual e os comportamentos sexuais não são boas medidas da orientação sexual. Os sentimentos sexuais, sim"", diz Paul Vasey.

 Nem tudo está no DNA
--------------------

 Qazi Rahmandiz afirma que grupos de genes que determinam a atração pelo mesmo sexo só explicam parte da variedade da sexualidade humana.

 Outros fatores biológicos que variam naturalmente também interferem. Um em cada sete homens, por exemplo, devem sua sexualidade ao ""Efeito Big Brother"": observou-se que garotos com irmãos mais velhos têm maiores chances de serem gays - cada irmão mais velho aumentaria as chances de homossexualidade em cerca de um terço.

 Ainda não se sabe o porquê, mas uma teoria é a de que a cada gravidez de um bebê do sexo masculino, o corpo da mulher desenvolve uma reação imunológica a proteínas que tem um papel no desenvolvimento do cérebro masculino.

 Como isto só interfere de alguma forma no bebê depois que muitos irmãos já nasceram - a maioria dos quais serão heterossexuais e terão filhos - esta peculiaridade pré-natal não foi descartada pela evolução.

We know that offering a small reward for basically nothing (like logging in) and then offering a bigger reward for a significant investement is a standard gambling mechanic.

They start by giving shit with playing naturally, to ensure you will either a) spend thousands of hours or b) spend hundreds of dollar. Blizzard uses the same tactic with Diablo for instance. There's a reason some of their games are under investigation from the EU gambling commission. It's immoral business practice, and it's why I refuse to buy anything from them. To be fair, Valve had the same problem with lootboxes for Dota in the Netherlands, and they changed their lootboxes (luckily, those are just cosmetic). 

Valve just doesn't want to go down that road, period. They've said so in several video's that they don't want to have a gambling game. 

I agree that it's not ideal to have a system that rewards people who invest money in a skill-based game. However, the competitive players will win free card packs AND free tickets. Plus, the 'investment' needed to get a competitive deck is not that high from what I've seen. So I disagree that there's no slow progress.

Você falou que eu não pago nada pra ir no posto de saúde. Mas claro que eu pago, eu pago imposto.

Seria o mesmo que dizer que eu não pago nada ao usar meu plano de saúde privado, só porque paguei antes de usá-lo.

Ou nunca usou um plano de saúde privado sem participação? Eu já fiz inúmeros exames e consultas sem pagar ""nada, 0, free"", porque tava pagando mensal.

&gt;E quando eu falei de o custo do tratamento ser barato não to falando de quanto a pessoa tem que desbancar, mas os custos totais, contabilizando o que é pago por impostos, o SUS gasta 1/8 do preço que um plano privado diz gastar num tratamento de AIDS.

E eu te dei as razões do porque eu vejo isso acontecer, e to esperando o seu caso.

Não existe ""livre mercado"" de tratamento de AIDS quando todo mundo é obrigado a pagar pra alguém que oferece subsidiado (sem custos nesse caso).

Seria como o governo abrir uma entregadora de cartas, subisidá-la e falar ""tá vendo as outas entregadoras de cartas, são bem mais caras"". Claro que são, elas não conseguem crescer e atingir economia de escala porque não há demanda pra isso.

&gt;porque isso tornaria o preço mais barato? se é feito por imposto e licitação publica eles não poderiam simplesmente inventar um custo alto pra superfaturar as coisas, como é ""feito em tudo que envolve o governo""?

Três motivos:

1- dinheiro da saúde é mais escasso do que em outras áreas do governo

2- é mais fácil otimizar um processo rigido como esse

3- é algo que chama muita atenção, tanto que você defende isso

&gt;Se o seu argumento é que ""sem sermos roubados pelos impostos as coisas seriam mais baratas"" tome um pouco de cuidado, porque o barato sempre sai caro.

Repara que eu não to pedindo pelas coisas baratas. Eu to pedindo pra ter opção e pagar o preço real delas.

&gt;Inclusive, eu sei que você ficou com preguiça de pesquisar mas eu repito pra você:

É uma questão completamente irrelevante. Não existe nada que uma iniciativa Estatal pode fazer que uma iniciativa privada não pode, exceto cobrar imposto e mudar as regras em seu favor.

Se você quer argumentar em favor do Estado, tem que me mostrar ou algo que o Estado pode fazer pra baratear o custo que uma iniciativa privado não é capaz, ou como cobrar imposto ou mudar as regras em seu favor é bom pra nós.

E pra te saciar, eu cheguei a fazer uma pesquisa rápida na hora, mas encontrei só um PDF sobre os custos do SUS em 1996, se você acha que essa informação contribui em algo pra discussão você pode trazer ela ao invés de criar esforço desnecessário.",True,False,False,,0,1543663178,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eauj75p,False,t3_a1thvq,True,t1_eatffnb,/r/brasilivre/comments/a1thvq/mamãefalei_errou_e_feio/eauj75p/,,1546273730,1,True,False,brasilivre,t5_351wl,r/brasilivre,public,[],text,False,

French &amp; German MEP's, (who have the largest block in the EU Parliament - about to get larger due to Brexit), are also pushing a law that would **ban** EU companies and financial institutions from complying with US sanctions on Iran, just to protect their business interests and keep the cheap oil flowing. Whatever you think of Trump, the US and Iran - This will fuck EU companies because they now have to decide who they want to be permanently banned for trading with for life **and** have billions in fines placed on them, the US or EU? Wow what a great economic choice.

The UK meanwhile spearheaded the sanctions against Russia, even ahead of the US, and even despite our financial industry being the biggest EU industry to take the first hit, and we're even pushing for more harsher sanctions on an EU / UN level, which guess who... Germany and France are vetoing. The UK was also the first country to place a battalion of infantry in Eastern Europe in response to Russia's invasion and illegal annexation of part of Ukraine, we had soldiers and aircraft in Poland within weeks.. What did Germany do? Oh that's right, complain we are provoking Russia and everyone needs to ""calm down"", the identical statement they just gave about the recent illegal actions last weekend by Russia in the Azov Sea.

With friends like that, who needs enemies?

3. We use *race* to describe appearance and that's it. Some records use the word ""tez"". The words white, black, trigueño, jabao, and moreno are used as rough informal descriptors of physical appearance. Many of those terms don't appear on the census.

4. Most Puerto Ricans are predominantly European in terms of genetic composition so most Puerto Ricans default to *white* even if by some standards they're *light brown*.

 Sessão do STF durante julgamento de ação direta de constitucionalidade sobre indulto natalino - Pedro Ladeira/Folhapress A lista de 22 condenados que seriam beneficiados pelo [indulto de Michel Temer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-dara-indulto-na-presidencia.shtml), divulgada pela força-tarefa da Lava Jato, causou controvérsia no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal). Magistrados receberam documentos dizendo que, do total de réus, 14 já estão soltos ou em prisão domiciliar.

 Ministros afirmam que estes condenados já estariam usufruindo de penas mais brandas e até da liberdade não graças a Temer —mas a benefícios que o próprio Ministério Público Federal concedeu a eles, depois de acordos de delação premiada.

 Entre os citados como possíveis perdoados na lista da força-tarefa está o [ex-doleiro Adir ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/ccr-faz-acordo-e-cita-doacao-via-caixa-dois-para-alckmin-e-serra.shtml)[Assad](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/ccr-faz-acordo-e-cita-doacao-via-caixa-dois-para-alckmin-e-serra.shtml). Condenado no total a mais de 30 anos de prisão, no Rio e no Paraná, há dúvida inclusive se ele poderia ser alcançado pelo indulto.

 Assad está solto desde outubro. Ele cumprirá mais dois anos de pena no regime semiaberto, com recolhimento domiciliar noturno e tornozeleira. Depois, prestará cinco anos de serviço comunitário.

 Já Dalton Avancini, ex-executivo da empreiteira Camargo Corrêa, também citado, foi condenado a 15 anos de prisão e ficou na cadeia por apenas quatro meses. Em 2015, celebrou acordo de colaboração. Passou para regime domiciliar. Desde março está solto, sem tornozeleira, prestando serviço uma vez por semana numa vara de Justiça.

 A obrigação que ele terá, por 11 anos, é a de fazer relatórios trimestrais sobre a vida que leva. Se for atingido pelo perdão de Temer, a única mudança prática em sua vida será não ter mais que escrever o documento.

 [Geddel Vieira Lima](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/supremo-adia-para-quinta-julgamento-sobre-indulto-de-temer.shtml), que não está na lista da Lava Jato mas também foi apontado como exemplo de condenado que seria beneficiado, não foi ainda nem sequer julgado. Por isso, não poderia ser perdoado.

 O indulto, de qualquer forma, seria bem-vindo mesmo para os condenados que já estão soltos. Com ele, todos voltariam a ser réus primários e não teriam mais que dar satisfação à Justiça.

 [  ](https://fotografia.folha.uol.com.br/galerias/nova/1618599352692630-bastidores-do-show-de-gilberto-gil-em-sp#foto-1618599352785056)Bastidores do show de Gilberto Gil em SP “Cadê o resto dos musos e das musas?”, perguntou a empresária Flora Gil, no camarim do Teatro Bradesco, em São Paulo, na quinta (29). Poucos minutos antes, seu marido, o cantor Gilberto Gil, tinha deixado o palco depois do show de lançamento do álbum “Ok, Ok, Ok”.

 Os “musos e musas” são os amigos do compositor que inspiraram canções de seu novo CD: os médicos Roberto Kalil (“Kalil”) e Roberta Saretta (“Quatro Pedacinhos”) e a jornalista Andréia Sadi (“Lia e Deia”).

 “Você viu que ele cantou a sua musiquinha por 30 segundos e a minha foi o show inteiro, né?”, brincou Kalil com Saretta. O médico gravou com seu celular o momento em que Gil tocou a faixa na apresentação.

 O artista falou com a coluna sobre a cultura no Brasil no futuro governo.

 “Já houve experiências nesse sentido [sobre o fim do MinC como ministério isolado]. A articulação com as secretarias de cultura nos estados e municípios é muito importante, acho que até mais importante do que ter um ministério para chamar de seu [risos]. É preciso uma gestão para chamar de sua.

 Eu entendo que há uma certa decepção na classe, no setor, porque isso [fim do MinC] soa como um ‘downgrade’, né. Acho que vai depender muito da sensibilidade do ministro e da visão que o presidente tenha da questão cultural. Todo mundo da cultura vai estar prestando atenção.”

 Mais uma mudança no secretariado do prefeito Bruno Covas: Caio Megale deixa a secretaria da Fazenda. Philippe Duchateau assume em seu lugar.

 Antonio Palocci deixou Curitiba por volta das 21h da quinta (29). O motorista do ex-ministro foi buscá-lo de carro e ele chegou em seu apartamento, no bairro dos Jardins, em SP, na madrugada desta sexta (30). Palocci ficou preso por dois anos na capital paranaense.

 A possível vinda do presidente americano, [Donald Trump, para a posse de Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/11/bolsonaro-tem-alinhamento-internacional-cego-a-gestao-trump-critica-haddad.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/11/bolsonaro-tem-alinhamento-internacional-cego-a-gestao-trump-critica-haddad.shtml) será confirmada perto do dia 18 de dezembro. Essa é a data em que está prevista a vinda da equipe do FBI ao Brasil para reconhecer o espaço do evento.

 Bolsonaro pode não dar a volta na Esplanada dos Ministérios a bordo do Rolls Royce presidencial, como fizeram os outros ex-presidentes no dia da posse. A equipe que prepara a festa analisa a possibilidade de ele sair da residência oficial em carro fechado e ir direto subir a pé a rampa do Congresso Nacional.

 Militantes da Marcha da Maconha de SP pediram asilo político ao Consulado do Uruguai, que [regulamentou a venda da droga em 2017](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/sobe-66-o-numero-de-homicidios-no-uruguai-por-causa-do-narcotrafico.shtml). “Se eles aceitarem que brasileiros pacientes terapêuticos da maconha podem viver lá em condições de asilados políticos, tem gente da marcha que gostaria de ir”, afirma Gabriela Moncau, integrante do movimento.

 “Nos fazemos aqui presentes para solicitar asilo político em seu país, uma vez que nosso Estado nos persegue politicamente e ameaça nossas vidas ao não permitir o acesso legal e regulamentado ao uso terapêutico da maconha”, diz o documento.

 A professora de arte contemporânea Julia Bryan-Wilson, os curadores Thomas J. Lax e Mathieu Copeland, o coreógrafo Ismael Ivo e as artistas Carmen Luz e Cláudia Müller vão participar do seminário internacional “Histórias da Dança”, que ocorre no dia 12 de dezembro, no Masp, em São Paulo.

 O bloco carnavalesco Acadêmicos do Baixo Augusta será homenageado com a Salva de Prata, uma das comendas mais importantes do município, que é concedida pela Câmara Municipal. A entrega será feita na abertura do Festival do Baixo Augusta, no dia 2 de fevereiro.

 O crítico Amir Labaki esteve no lançamento do livro “Faz Pouco Tempo”, do jornalista Roberto Muylaert, realizada no Itaú Cultural, na quinta (29). O diretor do Itaú Cultural, Eduardo Saron, também passou por lá.

1. The Wall
2. Level the internet playing field by forcing tech companies to either own their content or stop censoring conservatives 
3. Strike the final blow against the failing mainstream media by showing they are leftist shills who hate everyday Americans
4. Tell America who was behind WTC7 collapsing when it wasn’t hit by an airplane 
5. Enforce the law on hiring illegal aliens (how many of you filled out those forms establishing your legal right to work, and backed it up with a driver’s license, Social Security card, and birth certificate)
6. Investigate and stop both voter fraud (illegal alien voting) and election fraud (deliberately miscounting or creating fraudulent ballots)

Assume these things don’t happen because of the Democrats and GOPe deep state allies. Then assume the leftists win in 2020 or 2024. Now imagine the laws and 1984-type state they will impose. We will see the FBI and IRS working with “helpful tips” from Google (your search history) and Facebook / Google / Amazon / Apple (your social media activity and text messaging), all in line with what the ACLU and SPLC say is hateful speech against THEIR VIEW of American values. Oh yeah, they will come for your weapons, too. 

The doubters need only watch what’s happening around us. The Clinton Foundation whistleblower’s home is raided. ANTIFA publishes Tucker’s home address. More and more conservative accounts on social media or YouTube (read: Google) are dropped or lose their ability to make money. 

The response to this police state won’t be pretty. Watch Europe over the next few years for a preview. At some point, Germany will fracture. Shit’s gonna look really ugly when it does. 

President Trump has one good opportunity in the best two years to reverse these trends. After watching how the fake Russia investigation with Mueller and Rosenstein have tied his hands, the future doesn’t look good. We would be wise to prepare for leftist control and mob violence.

The third match of the Zula Europe Pro League took place against the VirtuE, the first classified for the Pro League through the Qualifying Tournaments, against the aliens of the Spanish Esports Organization, x6tence.The maps chosen were Old Town and China.In the first map the Polish players showed a great level against the Spanish organization obtaining a result of 10 - 3. The MVP of this game was b07a, which carried out key kills for the victory of his team and obtained a KDA of 2.37 (15/8/4). The team of x6tence carried out a quite bad defense turn in which they conceded 6 rounds to VirtuE, which meant the defeat in the match after 3 attacks in vain very well defended by the Polish team.On the second map we could see a completely reversed situation. x6tence, which started attacking, ended up defeating the polish players with a result of 10 - 3. In this case the MVP was hunteR, with a KDA of 2.5 (13/8/7). x6tence managed to score seven rounds in his turn of attack, which put in a very compromised situation the Polish players, who could not do anything against the superb defense of the aliens, who only conceded a round in defense before reaching the victory.The final result was 1 - 1, which means 1 point for each team in the Zula Europe Pro League classification.Videos:VirtuE vs x6tence - Map 1VirtuE vs x6tence - Map 2General statistics:Virtuecontrax6.jpg

2- r/europe makes it sound like Byzantines never disappeared and that they were never conquered by Turks, a nomadic people whose elites were thoroughly Persianized, but instead Turks became them. Which is denying our history. I saw that in the infamous Ottoman thread. A guy literally claimed we were just muslim Byzantines and got 70 upvotes. Not that upvotes here actually have any value. But it showed that a lot of people unironically believe that. And that he actually tried to support his claim with genetics and literally said that Byzantines and Ottomans were the same empires (which was immediately debunked by me).

3- No historian says Ottomans were culturally Byzantine. Instead, Ottomans are seen as the last member of Turko-Persian tradition. 

I wonder. Why is r/Europe so obsessed with us? You say we're not European but at the same time you're constantly trying to link us to our former enemies who were without a doubt European.

La vida de la marroquí Najwa Awane cambió desde que un perro de raza Pitbull la mordió y tuvo que ser amputada su pierna izquierda. Se tomó esa decisión para salvar su vida, después de 17 cirugías que soportó durante 42 días que permaneció en un hospital español.

Awane, de 22 años, compite por primera vez en Sudamérica y lo hace en Cuenca, con motivo del Torneo Internacional Tennis Tour ITF, Ecuador Open 2018. Es siembra uno del certamen tenístico en silla de ruedas y se ubica en el puesto 37 del ranking mundial.

La africana integra el grupo de 25 tenistas que participan en las canchas del Cuenca Tenis y Golf Club, en representación de Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Marruecos, México, Perú y Ecuador. Cada deportista tiene su historia, pero todos luchan por demostrar a la sociedad que no existen límites cuando existe voluntad.

Awane, durante su año de rehabilitación en Cádiz, España, aprendió español. Viajó a ese país en compañía de su madre, Laripa Karam, con la ayuda del club de Atletismo Chiclana. Ella, antes de la agresión del perro, era atleta. A más de español habla árabe, francés e inglés. Tiene el título en la especialidad de Matemáticas.

La tenista marroquí, antes de los cotejos, suele hablar con sus rivales. Lo hizo con las sudamericanas, el 30 de noviembre del 2018. Por ejemplo, dialogaba con la colombiana Zuleiny Rodríguez y la peruana Lucia Isisola Solís. La primera compite por segunda vez en la capital azuaya y la segunda es debutante.

Rodríguez, de 17 años, es novia del chileno Alexander Cataldo, siembra uno del Torneo Internacional de Cuenca y 23 en el escalafón mundial. Se conocieron hace 14 meses en Sao Paulo, Brasil, durante un certamen. Él, antes de su partido de ayer, le brindó algunas indicaciones en la cancha.

La discapacidad de Rodríguez es de nacimiento, tuvo una malformación congénita de los miembros inferiores y al año tres meses le amputaron las piernas. Desde los dos años usa prótesis. “Gracias a Dios he podido salir adelante y he viajado a Holanda, Brasil, Chile, Perú…”. Su sueño es ser la número uno del mundo.

Cataldo, de 20 años, tiene innumerables competencias en el exterior, pero este año se lució al conseguir un título europeo en Holanda. Desde el 2008, cuando empezó jugar tenis en silla de ruedas, ha visitado Japón, Francia, Bélgica, entre otros países. Su objetivo es ubicarse entre los 10 mejores del planeta.

Ecuador, como anfitrión, tiene una delegación de siete tenistas y uno de ellos es Wladimir Alulema, quien se vinculó a este deporte hace siete años. Él jugaba fútbol en la Sub 14 de Liga de Quito, pero un accidente de tránsito registrado hace 10 años en Atacames lo alejó de las canchas.

Sufrió una lesión medular, con fractura completa de la medula espinal. Cuando recibía rehabilitación, en el Ministerio del Deporte de ese entonces, fue invitado a practicar tenis adaptado y aceptó con gusto. A sus 32 años recuerda que “fue duro usar silla de ruedas luego de ser caminante, pero es una oportunidad que me dio la vida”. Es supervisor de la construcción.

Uno de los novatos del torneo es el peruano Jorge Beltrán, de profesión economista. Incursionó hace un año en el tenis adaptado y considera que sus rivales le llevan una gran ventaja. Hace nueve años, haciendo un salto en la nieve cayó mal y quedaron inmovilizadas sus piernas. Antes competía en bicicleta con pedal de mano.

La mayoría de los tenistas que competirá en Cuenca, hasta mañana, llegó con la meta de sumar puntos para los Juegos Parapanamericanos del 2019 en Perú. De allí se proyectarán con miras a los Juegos Paralímpicos en Tokio 2020.

En el caso de la tenista marroquí, después de competir en la capital azuaya viajará a su país. En tres semanas viajará a Málaga, España, en donde hará su cuartel de prácticas para los Juegos Paralímpicos.

He wants to move to Europe forever (which is another issue within itself, I think he wants to escape), and I don’t want that but agreed to move there for under 10 years. That wasn’t good enough for him. So, we had to call it quits because we were both unhappy. I’m focusing on myself and focusing on what I want out of life. I picked up a new hobby: yoga.

Box all of their stuff away, put pictures onto a flash drive, cry until you can’t cry anymore, feel ALL of the feelings that your heart wants you to feel. Grieve. Don’t push the big scary feelings away. My biggest advice is: take the time to grieve. Don’t rush it. Everyone grieves differently. I’m still grieving and frankly, I don’t know when it will end, and that’s okay.

I'm from that interim generation who grew up with Star Wars on TV and in video but who only got to see them in a cinema when the Special Editions came out. The EU was important to me as that's where ALL of the Star Wars stories outside the films lay. 

I enjoyed the EU but I'm more thankful that were getting new post-rotj films and I'm  loving them. The Last Jedi was brilliant for me. I absolutely loved it as a Star Wars film which I feel was the first one to really say something (well,  a lot of things) since the originals. Yes, the prequels had their messages. But they were ones I found a bit uninteresting it obvious (perhaps because - especially ROTS - came out in a certain political climate). I feel like TLJ got down to some core humanity rather than societal commentary and I appreciate that.  And arguably (actually unarguably, in my opinion) the weakest part of that film is Canto Bight where the lessons are very obvious (slavery is bad, animal cruelty is bad, war profiteering is bad).

This time though I saw him walk into the bar by himself.  It appeared he had a couple of friends in the bar but I was able to catch him in a moment by himself. I walked right up to him and stuck out my hand and said “i just want to shake your hand and thank you for playing in Bend a couple summers ago” he said “yeah man it was really cool to play here” he then asked me my name and he said “nice to meet you Pat, my name is Chino”  

I asked him if they plan on coming back to Bend and he said “we really want to in the next 1-2 years but nothing is set in stone yet”.  I then said “you guys really set the bar high because Bend never got any rock shows or metal shows before and now Mastodon was here over the summer” he said “I know man i was super bummed I missed that show, we just got back from Europe the next day and I was bummed I missed out on them and Primus”.  A couple more words were exchanged and then I said it was a “pleasure meeting you” and he said “likewise” and he extended his fist out for a fist bump and that was it. It was about a 3 min interaction. I didn’t ask for a photo or autograph and although I was a bit nervous I really did my best to maintain my composure. I hope to see him around town again cause now I’ll just say what’s up and give him a fist bump. If he remembers my name I will die a happy person.

In order to sell a drug in the US, you need a marketing application with extensive info on the product quality, safety, and efficacy. Not only does the mountain of evidence take years (even decades in some cases) to obtain and distill into an organized package, FDA application reviews and inspections can take over a year on top of the time (and money) spent to meet with FDA and respond to questions. Regulatory philosophies between the US, EU, CAN, and JP differ in many ways, so a drug approved and manufactured in Spain might not meet the requirements set forth by FDA. You might be required to conduct additional clinical trials or alter your manufacturing process, which can be particularly burdensome since it would need to be justified to the other countries where a product is marketed.

Without appropriate IP protections, companies would have fewer incentives to develop new drugs as the risk of development and registration might not be worth it if there's no guarantee of some exclusivity. Trying to find a balance between fostering new drug development and ensuring patients are able to afford life saving medications by passing laws without considering the nuances of the regulatory and legal environments can raise more problems than before.

A frequent criticism of our legislature is that lawmakers pass laws on issues they don't fully understand that could hamstring agencies from working with industry and patient advocacy groups to develop policy and enforce existing legislation.

There is no evidence that worship was limited to a single deity associated with a city, although cities did have patron or namesake deities.  In fact, the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians all worshipped basically the same set of deities despite cultural differences.  Likewise, the ancient Egyptians had an incredibly large pantheon of gods.  In Egypt, pharaoh Akhenaten attempted to impose a monotheistic belief in Aten, the sun disc, but this shift from the earlier polytheism to monotheism was not widely accepted by the ancient Egyptians as evidenced by the desecration of Akhenaten's images and capital city, Armana, after his 17 year reign ended.  In ancient history terms, monotheism does not emerge until Judaism and Zoroastrianism in about 1000 BCE.  One thing I do find interesting is the large numbers of small carved female figures found throughout much of Europe, dating back to 30,000 to 22,000 BCE, such as the Woman of Willendorf.  These may represent a belief in a fertility goddess, but it is not known for certain that these figures were meant to represent a deity.

False,xbettel,1418736883.0,,,,,,t2_k2bdl,"&gt; BURLINGTON, Vt. — By now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has gotten used to supporters urging him to run for president in 2020; at rallies, at airports, on his weekday walks to the Capitol. At a Friday night gathering here, Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis went further: Only Bernie Sanders could save the world.

&gt; **“Let me convey a message from all of us in Europe, for all those comrades of yours who are now struggling to reclaim our cities, our world, our world, our environment,” Varoufakis said. “We need Bernie Sanders to run for president.”**

&gt; The senator from Vermont, who is actively discussing whether to mount another campaign, smiled and closed the session. But over three days at the Sanders Institute’s inaugural conference, the senator and his supporters described a democracy under attack by populist right-wing forces as compromise-hungry “neoliberals” lacked a vision to defend it — a dynamic they see as leading to President Trump’s win in 2016.

&gt; Even as Democrats won back the House of Representatives last month, some high-profile left-wing candidates fell short, a dynamic Sanders struggled with; he opened the weekend conference by saying the party could have done better. For the senator and his supporters, it was clear that Democrats had squandered power when they last held it, leading to a surge of right-wing nationalism. To avoid a repeat, the left needed to organize — preferably, many here believe, with Sanders in the White House.

&gt; **“Neoliberal establishments are collapsing, not just here, but around the world,” said Cornel West**, a crusading academic who endorsed Sanders in 2016 and backed the Green Party’s campaign when Sanders lost the primary. “The only thing presented [to people] that has some credibility is vicious, authoritarianism fascism. If we don’t have a left populism that’s credible, we’re running down a fascist road.”

&gt; West, who has encouraged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate, said in an interview that the senator looked to be committed to his work inside the Democratic Party. And even at the conference, an invitation-only affair for around 250 people, there was speculation that another candidate could pick up Sanders’s banner in 2020.

&gt; **Author Naomi Klein told a Friday audience that support for a “Green New Deal,” a jobs plan based on a transition away from fossil fuels, would be essential for “any candidate who wanted to run as a progressive in 2020,”** Sanders or otherwise. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who spoke at the conference Saturday, is actively exploring her own presidential bid. No Democrat seen as a potential nominee, said West, came with as much “baggage,” where the left was concerned, as Hillary Clinton had.

&gt; Sanders, 77, has frequently praised the ways Democrats adopted his “really radical ideas” — he uses the term sarcastically — during and after the 2016 election. It started with the drafting of a more left-wing platform and continued this year as a record number of House and Senate Democrats and Democratic candidates endorsed the main planks of the Sanders movement — Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage.

&gt; Several candidates who had lost races this year also made it to Burlington, saying they would come away thinking that the movement had been dealt a temporary defeat and was still reshaping the Democratic Party, while potentially allowing other candidates to compete in the same 2020 lane as Sanders.

&gt; “Some [potential presidential] candidates have reached out to me since the midterms,” said Randy Bryce, a union organizer who lost an expensive and closely watched House race in Wisconsin, running on a Sanders-style platform of universal Medicare and abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. **“They’re interested in the message. Once people are educated on what Medicare-for-all involves, it can be popular throughout the country.”**

&gt; But for many at the conference, the only clear way to pull that off was to nominate Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries with nearly 14 million votes and with high favorable ratings. In October, a Gallup poll put Sanders’s favorable rating at 53 percent; it has been above 50 percent ever since his primary bid gained steam three years ago. Polls that test Sanders against President Trump consistently show Sanders with a lead.

&gt; **“Since we need to take such bold steps forward, it might be that we need someone who’s been clear and consistent for 40 years,” said John Cusack, an actor and activist. **“I hope to God that he runs and wins. What makes me hopeful is that when I talk to millennials and younger people, they get it. They love Bernie. They want a future.”

&gt; The risk, said Sanders’s supporters, was bigger than one more lost election. A major theme of the weekend was that the international left had failed to organize as effectively as the nationalist right. Varoufakis’s remarks Friday ended with the launch of Progressive International, an effort to build ties and share strategies between left-wing activists and parties across the world. Sanders campaign veterans, separately, had already been training left-wing parties in Europe on the tactics used in the 2016 campaign.

&gt; **“After the [2008 economic] crisis, two kinds of people united internationally: bankers and fascists,” Varoufakis said in a short interview. “The only people who never bound together were progressives.”**

&gt; Sanders himself has argued that the “post-World War II global order,” which in many countries responded to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 by cutting back social services. This, he says, enabled the rise of candidates who appealed to fear of changes both economic and demographic, like Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and of right-wing governments in countries like Italy and Hungary. While Sanders’s flock was gathering, Bolsonaro was at the international Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires, meeting with Trump national security adviser John Bolton.

&gt; **Fernando Haddad, the left-wing politician who lost to Bolsonaro after courts barred popular former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from running, said in an interview that his country was “harvesting the consequences of the neoliberal project’s failure.”** At weekend panels, Sanders supporters argued that Democrats had created the opening for Trump by failing to crack down on industries, like health insurance and banking, that many voters saw as exploitative.

&gt; “Right now the racist, violent, homophobic, and sexist far right is organizing,” said Ada Colau, the left-wing mayor of Barcelona. “We need to amplify all the alternatives we are building out in the world.”

&gt; For Sanders die-hards, there was no longer any question that he would be the best possible candidate to reverse the gains of right-wing nationalists. RoseAnn DeMoro, who had turned National Nurses United into the biggest labor backer of Sanders’s 2016 bid, took every chance she could to urge the senator to run again. Asked if she had been contacted by other presidential hopefuls, DeMoro was incredulous.

When I saw TFA I didn't really care about Snoke, I saw him and was like ""oh, creepy dark side guy, probably an old sith or something"" and moved on. What made him interesting was his relationship with Kylo, how he leveraged the boy's angst and obviously conflicted feelings about his family legacy and turned him.

Snoke saying he was an Inquisitor or from some new group of dark side users wouldn't change that relationship with Kylo and would remove the at least kinda interesting mystery about him. I guess I'm fine with the short ""He found the first order in the unknown regions"" explanation because it leaves the Galaxy feeling larger while still making perfect sense.

This is a bit of an aside, but I feel the frustration that the movies don't make the political situation in the Galaxy 100% clear. It's just that it doesn't really matter because I care about the characters more than grand geopolitics, and the prequels tried to do both ended up bogging down the first two movies with bad exposition and leaving a lot characters kinda underwritten.

If that was the case, shouldn't the countries with the tightest gun control have the lowest homicide rates?

Cyprus probably have the strictest laws in Europe, UK is pretty strict and so is Russia.

Cyprus homicide rate 1.11 in 2016

UK homicide rate 1.20 in 2016

Russia homicide rate 10.82 in 2016

Meanwhile countries like Norway (0.51), Switzerland (0.54), Czech Republic (0.64) and Austria (0.66), are fairly low. Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Austria all have looser gun laws than the European average. (All numbers from 2016).

If you look within the UK itself then it's England and Wales (1.22), Scotland (1.18) and Northern Ireland (0.97), which is interesting since Northern Ireland is the region that still maintains some of the older, looser regulations in the UK - they still allow large caliber semiatuomatic handguns for example where England/Wales/Scotland has restricted that to .22lr only.

As others have said, find yourself a new player friendly guild that can offer up any in-game advice or items - equipment you may need as you enjoy the game your way. 
(If you're on PS4 EU I could send you an invite to a guild that would be perfect for just that) 

My advice is to not grind a spot for xp etc. Just do the story quests and side quests (as you would in Skyrim) so you can get used to your character and the skills your class has. 

There are three main role types available that can be achieved by any race on any class. 

So choose one that feels or looks the most enjoyable to you. 
For questing, you'll need a certain level of damage and survivability as there is a good level of solo content (The main story quests for example) where you might feel a bit of a struggle. But as you level, you get stronger. So if you do feel a little weak, go and find another quest, enjoy it, come back later and smash it! 

There is always a lot of talk about sets and their bonuses and build types. But until you hit CP160. They are pretty much useless unless you're making a certain build for under 50 battlegrounds or under 50 Cyrodill. 
Just use what you can find that helps our play style for now. And that helps you get more out of your character. (More health. More stamina. More magica etc)
The same with food buffs.

Take time to read through your skills, your items, your buffs etc.

Decon all your old gear as you upgrade to newer stuff. Decon is the fastest way to level your skill lines in crafting (aside food and alchemy) 

Sorry if this is a long read. Just trying to offer up as much info as possible that I wish I knew when I first started. 

Ultimately. Enjoy the game for what it is, and don't be afraid to ask for help. There are plenty of people around willing to help in zone chat. 
Just type 
/z followed by your message to ask in zone 
/g If they group with you

False,4now5now6now,1463969048.0,,,,,,t2_y4v2q,"BURLINGTON, Vt. — By now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has gotten used to supporters urging him to run for president in 2020; at rallies, at airports, on his weekday walks to the Capitol. At a Friday night gathering here, Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis went further: Only Bernie Sanders could save the world.

“Let me convey a message from all of us in Europe, for all those comrades of yours who are now struggling to reclaim our cities, our world, our world, our environment,” Varoufakis said. “We need Bernie Sanders to run for president.”

The senator from Vermont, who is actively discussing whether to mount another campaign, smiled and closed the session. But over three days at the Sanders Institute’s inaugural conference, the senator and his supporters described a democracy under attack by populist right-wing forces as compromise-hungry “neoliberals” lacked a vision to defend it — a dynamic they see as leading to President Trump’s win in 2016.

Even as Democrats won back the House of Representatives last month, some high-profile left-wing candidates fell short, a dynamic Sanders struggled with; he opened the weekend conference by saying the party could have done better. For the senator and his supporters, it was clear that Democrats had squandered power when they last held it, leading to a surge of right-wing nationalism. To avoid a repeat, the left needed to organize — preferably, many here believe, with Sanders in the White House.

“Neoliberal establishments are collapsing, not just here, but around the world,” said Cornel West, a crusading academic who endorsed Sanders in 2016 and backed the Green Party’s campaign when Sanders lost the primary. “The only thing presented [to people] that has some credibility is vicious, authoritarianism fascism. If we don’t have a left populism that’s credible, we’re running down a fascist road.”

West, who has encouraged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate, said in an interview that the senator looked to be committed to his work inside the Democratic Party. And even at the conference, an invitation-only affair for around 250 people, there was speculation that another candidate could pick up Sanders’s banner in 2020.

Author Naomi Klein told a Friday audience that support for a “Green New Deal,” a jobs plan based on a transition away from fossil fuels, would be essential for “any candidate who wanted to run as a progressive in 2020,” Sanders or otherwise. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who spoke at the conference Saturday, is actively exploring her own presidential bid. No Democrat seen as a potential nominee, said West, came with as much “baggage,” where the left was concerned, as Hillary Clinton had.

Sanders, 77, has frequently praised the ways Democrats adopted his “really radical ideas” — he uses the term sarcastically — during and after the 2016 election. It started with the drafting of a more left-wing platform and continued this year as a record number of House and Senate Democrats and Democratic candidates endorsed the main planks of the Sanders movement — Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage.

Several candidates who had lost races this year also made it to Burlington, saying they would come away thinking that the movement had been dealt a temporary defeat and was still reshaping the Democratic Party, while potentially allowing other candidates to compete in the same 2020 lane as Sanders.

“Some [potential presidential] candidates have reached out to me since the midterms,” said Randy Bryce, a union organizer who lost an expensive and closely watched House race in Wisconsin, running on a Sanders-style platform of universal Medicare and abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. “They’re interested in the message. Once people are educated on what Medicare-for-all involves, it can be popular throughout the country.”

[Take a look at the possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidates]

But for many at the conference, the only clear way to pull that off was to nominate Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries with nearly 14 million votes and with high favorable ratings. In October, a Gallup poll put Sanders’s favorable rating at 53 percent; it has been above 50 percent ever since his primary bid gained steam three years ago. Polls that test Sanders against President Trump consistently show Sanders with a lead, though at this point in the 2016 cycle, polling showed Trump badly trailing in a matchup with Clinton.

“Since we need to take such bold steps forward, it might be that we need someone who’s been clear and consistent for 40 years,” said John Cusack, an actor and activist. “I hope to God that he runs and wins. What makes me hopeful is that when I talk to millennials and younger people, they get it. They love Bernie. They want a future.”

The risk, said Sanders’s supporters, was bigger than one more lost election. A major theme of the weekend was that the international left had failed to organize as effectively as the nationalist right. Varoufakis’s remarks Friday ended with the launch of Progressive International, an effort to build ties and share strategies between left-wing activists and parties across the world. Sanders campaign veterans, separately, had already been training left-wing parties in Europe on the tactics used in the 2016 campaign.

“After the [2008 economic] crisis, two kinds of people united internationally: bankers and fascists,” Varoufakis said in a short interview. “The only people who never bound together were progressives.”

Sanders himself has argued that the “post-World War II global order,” which in many countries responded to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 by cutting back social services. This, he says, enabled the rise of candidates who appealed to fear of changes both economic and demographic, like Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and of right-wing governments in countries like Italy and Hungary. While Sanders’s flock was gathering, Bolsonaro was at the international Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires, meeting with Trump national security adviser John Bolton.

Fernando Haddad, the left-wing politician who lost to Bolsonaro after courts barred popular former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from running, said in an interview that his country was “harvesting the consequences of the neoliberal project’s failure.” At weekend panels, Sanders supporters argued that Democrats had created the opening for Trump by failing to crack down on industries, like health insurance and banking, that many voters saw as exploitative.

“Right now the racist, violent, homophobic, and sexist far right is organizing,” said Ada Colau, the left-wing mayor of Barcelona. “We need to amplify all the alternatives we are building out in the world.”

The weekend gathering was by far the Institute’s biggest project since its founding last year by Jane O’Meara Sanders, who is married to the senator, and came at an auspicious moment for Sanders’s own prospects. Two weeks earlier, federal investigators closed their investigation of a land deal that O’Meara Sanders made as president of a now-defunct college, a favorite subject of the senator’s political opponents, who had watched an FBI probe sink Clinton’s 2016 campaign.

For Sanders die-hards, there was no longer any question that he would be the best possible candidate to reverse the gains of right-wing nationalists. RoseAnn DeMoro, who had turned National Nurses United into the biggest labor backer of Sanders’s 2016 bid, took every chance she could to urge the senator to run again. Asked if she had been contacted by other presidential hopefuls, DeMoro was incredulous.

“There are no other candidates,” she said.

A fork is a pole weapon which was used in war in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries. Like many polearms, the military fork traces its lineage to an agricultural tool, in this case the pitchfork. 

Unlike a trident used for fishing, the military fork was rarely barbed and normally consisted only of two tines (prongs) which were straight compared to the original pitchfork. The pair of tines usually ran parallel or slightly flared.This weapon was relatively easy to use compared to a sword, which could take years to learn how to wield effectively.

It wouldn't surprise me if UAwire was set up specifically for propaganda purposes (though propaganda comes on a sliding scale - it's not an on/off property). What I objected to was how iceman312 presented his suspicions as *fact*, with no context, and then later, when pressed, was not able to back up such a strong claim.

Your heuristics for determining if a site is a propaganda outlet might be useful shortcuts, but they are dangerous to rely on. A webpage with valuable reporting could have a cheap design because it's made by a single person with few resources. Conversely, a propaganda page could look elegant and professional if somebody is willing to invest in the propaganda. There are similar problems with the social media heuristic: [Twitter likes and followers can be bought in the hundreds of thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html?module=inline). And few followers does not mean it's propaganda either. For example, the Independent Barents Observer, which as far as I know is a reliable, high-quality source of news about the European arctic, has only 4159 followers and 760 likes.

If I interpret your 3rd point correctly, then it sounds like you're saying that it's suspicious that it's a specialized news site covering mainly Ukraine and Russia. If so, then I disagree. People make news sites about things they care about and know about, and such specialized news sites can have higher quality than generic whole-world new sites that have to spread their resources thin. [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com) is an example of a relatively specialized (at least when I read it a few years back - looks like it might have branched out to cover a bit more than Russia/Ukraine over time) news site with much more thorough investigation than generalist news sites. In the case of UAwire, one could imagine that such a site could have been made by somebody living in Ukraine - I'm sure there are many people in Ukraine who are sufficiently interested in that situation to put in the effort to start a news site about it (though in that case I would have expected there to be an Ukrainian language version available too, which there doesn't appear to be).

Actually determining whether something is propaganda or not is a lot more work than looking at superficial features like those. One can look at a representative subset of articles and check their factuality and tone. These can give a good indication of the quality and bias of the source, but that isn't enough to show that it's propaganda. Propaganda differs from mere inaccurate, biased reporting by being purposefully inaccurate and/or biased.

Yes, that is the excuse they constantly trot out. 

However, studies have actually found that the way topics are framed is consistently biased towards right-wing neoliberal economics and political opinions.

&gt;Contrary to dominant ideas that the BBC is biased to the left, our findings suggest that its economic journalism discursively normalises neoliberal economics, not necessarily as desirable, but certainly as inevitable.

[Framing the cuts:  An analysis of the BBC’s discursive framing of the ConDem cuts agenda](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884913501835)


&gt;the author of the 2007 study, Alan Budd, found no ‘evidence of systemic (anti-business) bias’ but he did discover a neglect of news from the perspectives of investors and workers. Indeed, the author noted indifference to the coverage of labour issues:

&gt;Around  29  million  people  work  for  a  living  in  the  UK  and  spend  a  large proportion  of  their  waking  hours  in  the  workplace.  However,  little  of  this important part of UK life is reflected in the BBC’s business coverage The belief that the BBC is ‘anti-business’ or indeed, ‘left-wing’ in general, is often informed by naked opinion and prejudice. 

[Tunnel Vision: the tendency for BBC economic and business news to follow elite opinion and excludeother credible perspectives](http://futureoftv.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Gary-Merrill.pdf) (As pointed out by /u/Yvellkan, although this cites peer review literature, this is not a peer-reviewed source.)

&gt;Tories get more airtime than Labour

&gt;So what about the accusation that the BBC is pro-EU? Again the evidence points in the opposite direction. 

&gt;What about the accusation that the BBC is anti-business? Once again the evidence shows that the opposite is the case. 

&gt;The fact that the City financiers who had caused the crisis were given almost monopoly status to frame debate again demonstrates the prominence of pro-business perspectives.

&gt;So the evidence from the research is clear. The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world, not a left-wing, anti-business agenda.

Zaev was a drug dealer in Strumica for years but Gruevski the patriot is shady ? 

Zaev does not allow recount in elections but Gruevski the patriot is shady ? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Gruevski's crime was caring about the Macedonian people . They ( Soros , EU , liberal elites ) were just getting him out of the way &amp; putting Zaev in for 2 reasons . the first was so he could go to Greece begging and pleading and humiliating our country . The second was so that Zaev would sign the UN compact for Global Migration . After we have been fully humiliated for Greece , we will join the EU , they will give us money , and we will have to spend it all on letting refugees in ( like what they did to Slovenia ) .

[Case 76 - Silk Road - Part 1 of 3](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-76-silk-road-part-1/)  

The Silk Road was an ancient network of trade routes that started in China in the 2nd century B.C. Via a combination of roads, and sea routes, goods like silk, paper and spices were transported from the producers in Asia to markets in Europe. 

Eventually, it wasn’t just goods that were traded – there were also ideas, customs, religions and even diseases. 

The Silk Road expanded throughout different continents and civilizations for several centuries. It connected Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. A marketplace across the world. 

Two major expansions can be traced back to the Silk Road. One of these was the introduction of Buddhism into China. The second was the Black Death. 

Vermin accompanied some of the goods along the silk road – and upon the vermin were fleas. These fleas carried the bubonic plague—also known as the Black Death—and as the fleas entered Europe, so did the plague. It’s estimated that in the 14th century, between 100 and 125 million people died from the Black Death, reducing the world’s population by somewhere between 30 and 60%. 

The Silk Road is recognized as the very first true globalization that the world experienced. The free trade of goods and the passing of ideas and customs from one society to another. It changed everything.  

It would be many centuries later that a very different kind of marketplace would open up on a modern platform, a new trade route – using the same name. 

Silk Road.

Nob and the Dread Pirate Roberts started to communicate regularly. The Dread Pirate Roberts had no idea he was really speaking to a DEA agent. And the DEA agent had no idea about the true identity of the Dread Pirate Roberts. 

But it was a promising start.

[Case 76 - Silk Road -  Part 3 of 3](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-76-silk-road-part-3/)  

As the two agents walked towards the front door of 2260 Fifteenth Avenue, one of them pulled out the fake IDs to have another look before asking questions. 

When they reached the door, the same agent was about to knock when he saw a man standing on the other side of the door wearing nothing but shorts. It was the man whose picture was on the fake identity cards. 

Ross Ulbricht froze, the two men in suits staring at him from outside the front door could only mean one thing. 

He managed to compose himself and slowly opened the door.

&gt; The advantage of punishment is that it may cause sufficient harm to Putin to convince him not to undertake subsequent efforts. But the actual likelihood of these punishment activities succeeding is difficult to assess. It is impossible to know whether the Russian government would have undertaken additional activities against the United States without the existing punishment or whether greater punishment would have led  to greater Russian restraint. Some options for punishment include democracy promotion activities (described in more detail in a later section) or otherwise weakening Putin’s hold on power, echoing Soviet-era U.S. tactics of political warfare. One participant recommended a U.S. policy of putting “Russia back to where it belongs, a nation with minimal economic footprint and appropriate with its post–Cold War position. Russia is trying to hit above its weight right now.”

&gt; Punishment has several disadvantages and risks. First, as one participant noted, sanctions may not be effective because, from his perspective, the impact of sanctions is small, relative to other incentives shaping Russia’s decisions. By his account, the Ukraine sanctions, which have been in place for years, were a “blunt, ineffective tool,” and the “the prices have to be very high” to convince Russia to change its  policy. Another participant similarly observed that sanctions have affected the Russian economy, but not necessarily its policies.

&gt; Second, punishment requires attribution, which is currently quite difficult and time-intensive and likely to grow more difficult. Obfuscation techniques continually evolve and improve, and a nation-state with sufficient motivation and expertise, such as Russia, is likely to avidly pursue such technologies.

&gt; A third disadvantage of punishment is that it could lead Russia to escalate its activities against the United States. Accounts of Russian foreign policy highlight how Russia is motivated to undertake aggressive actions toward the West because of the perceived threat of Western actions. Any additional Western punishments, especially actions targeted toward weakening Putin’s hold on power, are likely to be taken as a direct threat to the regime and lead to escalation. Further, Russia may not distinguish between actions intended as a response to its specific activities on social media and actions intended as a larger Western intent to weaken or cause harm to Russian interests. One workshop participant suggested that the United States could make the link-age clear through informal communications. But many participants observed that the current lack of clear coordination among U.S. gov-ernment bodies could undermine the impact of deterrence by punishment. Mutual  distrust between Russia and the United States could similarly undermine the clarity of message associated with punishment.

&gt; A final disadvantage is that U.S. allies may not support punishing Russia, especially European countries who seek to maintain a positive relationship  with Russia and who may perceive U.S. actions against Russia as unnecessarily aggressive.",True,False,False,,0,1543708413,,1543720680,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eavyan6,True,t3_a27p5d,True,t3_a27p5d,/r/ActiveMeasures/comments/a27p5d/countering_russian_social_media_influence/eavyan6/,,1546297607,2,True,False,ActiveMeasures,t5_3jror,r/ActiveMeasures,public,[],text,False,

False,Panda-eats,1538476962.0,,,,,,t2_2bwgzvzq,"A few thoughts that may help identify why you are feeling uncomfortable with this film. 

1.	The categorisation of “asians”. It’s meant to be predominantly Singaporean Chinese, but the film features stars and characters from all over Asia. These countries don’t share a language or culture. All they shares is an “otherness” when perceived by western audiences. It’s like making a film called “crazy rich Europeans” and lumping Latvian, German, Italian, English and Russian millionaires together as though they are an homogenous group. 
2.	It plays to the western idea that Asia has a lot of idle wealth. While the former colonies inherited a landed gentry, it is not the typical Asian experience that one can contribute nothing to society and still live in luxury. 
3.	It relies on yellow faces and not story. I understand why this works well for the diaspora. They’re sick of movies where no one looks like them or has any related cultural values. Finally this film presents some Asian faces. The culture is homogenous Asian and nothing is quite right, but people will overlook it because it gives them a sense of representation and belonging. To a Chinese native, who speaks mandarin and has access to hundreds of high quality Chinese movies that speak to their aesthetic and culture, crazy rich Asians offers nothing. The flaws in representation become evident, rather than the accuracies. 
4.	it’s generally a pretty crappy film. It lacks any problem to solve. The closest thing to a problem is “my mother doesn’t like you”. This is character, not story. There are clear and immediate resolutions (e.g. tell your mother you’re marrying her anyway). These can’t be explored because there is nothing else to drive the story line. If this were called “crazy rich people” and had the typically mostly white cast, no one would watch it.

Overall, for the diaspora I think it’s great that films like this are getting made. Representation and visibility help with what is likely a difficult journey of finding an identity. For local Chinese, these films will probably remain slightly insulting or at least generally off putting for a long time.

Isso é que eu acho impressionando, e isso é que destoa do resto dos partidos políticos. Veja se tem gente defendendo o Pezão, por exemplo. Tirando o advogado dele, até agora não achei um.

The British Isles are an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and over six thousand smaller isles. They have a total area of about 315,159 km2 and a combined population of just under 70 million, and include two sovereign states, the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island of Ireland) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The islands of Alderney, Jersey, Guernsey and Sark, and their neighbouring smaller islands, are sometimes also taken to be part of the British Isles, even though, as islands off the coast of France, they do not form part of the archipelago.The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2.7 billion years old. During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass.

Korea's movable type was made in 1234. Bi Sheng invented it in 1040. 

King Sejeong, the man who invented the Korean alphabet, was born in 1397.  The Korean alphabet was nowhere nearly as widely used as today. As recent as the 1970s, Korean newspapers were filled with Hanja. In the 1930s, Hanja was everywhere. The Korean alphabet system was extremely new in the 15th century, not widely used like it was in Europe. The Korean alphabet also doesn't move simply from left to right. Each square ""character"" can have its consonant or vowel shift in position, making it more difficult to implement. 

Your very 1st sentence is already wrong in so many ways. 

&gt;Also you are completely ingnoring the press component of the printing press. AKA the part of the invention that was actually revolutionary. This is besides the point. I have never claimed that the Gutenberg press is inferior. You're attacking the straw man. 

Gutenberg's version is of course superior. It's an improvement, not an invention. It isn't surprising that nations that use the Latin Alphabet improved upon it. 

&gt;In fact if we really want to go back far enough, the Minoans of Crete had invented Movable Type in the 16th century BC

This is interesting. I've never heard of it. It seems like it's disputed though and definitely not done on a mass scale.

They hear how inexpensive they are, and how all these younger people stay in them.  How they can avoid paying a larger hotel rate and what not. In reality hostels are simply not for everyone. One hostel I stayed at was quite possibly the filthiest place I've ever been in my life, and I felt dirtier after take a shower there.

Typically genders are split up and rooms are filled with 4-8 bunks. So you aren't going to be sleeping in the same room as your girlfriend/boyfriend (unless you've done research and ensured they had private rooms). I've stayed in hostels that only had a single shower/bathroom yet had 18 bunks.  Rarely is there anywhere to securely lock belongings, and bunk areas aren't typically locked. You'll be potentially sharing the room with homeless people or drug addicts who've saved up enough money sleep there for the night. This makes ensuring security of your belongings even harder. Always keep your passport/money on your person, especially when you are sleeping.

Many hostels make you leave during the day so they can clean, and also so there is less chance that a guest stays back to steal everyone's stuff. Some even have curfews where you aren't allowed back in if you don't get back by a certain time. Many have set time where you have to be in bed with the lights out. Definitely all factors you need to research before booking any extended period of time. Being drugged and/or raped is also something you should be on guard for, regardless of your gender.

I'm against hostels in any way. They serve a really good purpose and allow people to have a cheap place to stay. I just know too many people who have never been to one that book a two week hostel stay because of how much money they are going to save on their trip. They get there not realizing all the things I mentioned above. If you want privacy, a secure place to store your luggage, and freedom to come and go as you please, I'd recommend avoiding hostels then.

I went outside to find a crowded street filled with people just walking around, the street floor was made of old stone and it went down a hill, houses on either side.

In the middle of the crowd was one of my old teachers, except he had glowing red eyes and I got the feeling he was looking for me, so I snuck around him through the crowd and managed to make my way into antiheroes house similar to the one I started in.

This second house had a cabinet at the back wall, which when pushed aside revealed a large crack in the wall. I went into the crack to find a crawl space sized tunnel, which lead to an underground cliff.

At the bottom of the cliff there was a giant arena with a stage at the end that had a pedestal on it. There was also banners with strange markings on them.

I followed the cliff edge to a bridge which lead to a large industrial metal door. When I opened it, I met a British bald man who lead me through the rest of the room. After a certain point in this factory-like place, we tripped an alarm. 

All the lights went out, then started glowing red as a loud blaring noise began. Me and the British guy hid in there concrete tubes, and right when we did that, a bunch of naked guys wearing goat skulls broke down the back door of the room. They had donkey jaw axes. They found the British guy, pulled him out of the tube, and proceeded to dismember him as I watched.

Then they found me, and I had a similar fate. But then I woke up, back in the first house.

I went outside the house to find the street again, but it was empty this time, and my teacher was still there, searching. His eyes emitted a spotlight that I had to sneak around to get down to the second house.

After I opened the door to the second house, I was confronted by a bunch of my classmates and I showed them the cracked wall behind the dresser.

We went through to get to the cliff again, and when we looked down we saw the arena. It was filled this time, with a bunch of men wearing brown robes and hoods. Really priest-like.

On the stage was a man wearing the same robes and hood except in red, in front of the pedestal, and there were two other men wearing white robes and hoods to each of his sides.

The banners were still there, and the man with red robes had the same mark that were on them.

He said something in an unknown language, and then a giant rumbling started as all the brown-robed men started climbing up the cliff side like spiders. 

They crawled on the walls and started running towards me and my classmates. When they got to us they started climbing on us and biting into our flesh, like straight out of a zombie movie. I watched as my friends being eaten alive and when they got to me, I shit you not, I felt every bite into my skin.

I woke up (for real this time) at like 3 am.

False,TheLastMgtow,1535862332.0,,,,,,t2_249bssbi,"&gt; There are different habitation models around the world. As a child, I remember visiting 'hill tribes' (in the tropics) where all the men lived in a 'long house' and I think the women and children lived in extended matriachial groups in separate houses.

Thats genius. Thanks for telling me that. Can you tell me the exact tribe it was?

&gt; In the mixed flats I learnt how much more sensitive to 'interrelationships' women could be. I was going to say 'offence' as it was more around perceived 'slights' but the reverse were also important to them. This preoccupation is the inverse of the equity thing (equal sharing of resources) that women also feel and which is all the current rage.

I didnt understand this sentence, because you are using lots of obscure words and vague. 'Slights'? So women want to share equally resources in that tribe? The current rage you mean in the west or in the tribe. Sorry i dont understand.

&gt;When we (wife and family) moved city, my wife was keen to get a second house or flat for herself (she likes peace and quiet) as the kids were growing up. I was fine with that as she is pretty messy (from my perspective) but I decided the mortgage was going to be too high (I was the one paying most of it off).

My academic background is very related to this. I concluded that the home must be divided into two spaces and then have a common space. Both spaces should be relatively independent. On the other hand two different houses, will just make it unfeasible for a family. And in the present day it is very hard, and im not accusing you of nothing. But distance today means cheating or at least lack of trust. Its the culture we were raised in. It becomes a open relationship, and open relationships are always a bad deal for the male (unless he is a cuck).

&gt;However, my wife has made much bigger and more changes to her life for the 'good of our family' than I have.

Nobody is saying women dont work for their families. Actually some of the most damaged women with some bad pasts are the ones who then try to compensate. What is always ignored is, what is in for us men? Nothing. Not only we are happy alone, we have nothing in it for us. Men use to have standards in the past. Right now, men are weak and soft, and so needy that hoe just needs to give them some affection, and they cuck. Sorry for my language. Her affections aren't enough, and no man in his right mind would accept a deal based on emotions and feelings, thats right only weak men would accept that. The romantic era is over, mgtow is ending it.

What im trying to say is that you as a man will always bring more into the family. Because you as a man, forming a family, and staying around is not a natural imperative of your biology. The fatherhood was always a sacrifice we did with our good hearted altruism for society and for the weak women we wanted to protect, if you dont understand this then i have to just assume you are on the same level as women, and thats ok. In the wild, men have sex and leave women to fend for themselves, and thats what i always felt like doing, but they always manipulate you to stay with them.

&gt;In many ways, while my opportunities have been constrained by family I would have been much less productive (for society) if I had only needed to support myself.

Thats because most men need a whip. They need something or else they have no motivation. Most men indeed are slaves. Look at how many men go to war for scraps. Do you think women would do that? Look at how good they feel dying for someone else. This is something that mgtow and single selfactualized men see as cheese or mediocre.

&gt;That 'man alone' feeling can be strong because I'm not a team player, as such, but I like contributing to / being part of something that is bigger than myself.

Alone is what 90% of people in the world are in this precise moment. Mgtows are not ""alone"". Mgtows have families and male friends. They only refuse relationships where men will actually feel even more alone and conditioned. As a male you need companionship from the pack of hunters not females...

&gt;I like to focus on applying my skills rather than being in with a bunch of others. I'm the cliched 'loner' which I imagine is kind of Mgtow.

Not at all loneliness is different than being alone. Being alone is good if you love yourself. This is what the bluepill men dont realize because they have been lowered down to a shadow of their former selves. They have been indoctrinated to feel incomplete, to work, buy, marry and have kids who will go through the same pattern. 

&gt;I'm with JBP on this. One man, one wife seems to be the most content society. 

For society im with you too. But for the individual it is not. See? You are starting to see why JBP is a collectivist. His argument is all about fixing society and the collective, while not giving a fuck about men. He forgets that responsability comes with authority, no authority then no responsability, those willing to take responsability without authority are cowards and sellout slaves.

I call things by the names. Im sorry...

&gt;Had to google this. So women desire men they perceive to be 'powerful'. Yep.

Hybristophilia is not about power, its about love of a violent man. This is the reason why 87% of women orgasm during rape. The average sex she has with her husband that she is bored with has no comparison with the free mgtow man she has sex with no strings attached, its much more exciting. You should look at what women did when France was occupied by the nazis. And what they are pushing now in Europe welcoming islamic migrants. Thats female nature for you.

&gt;This isn't so as I gather young women are having less sexual partners now.

They are just sharing the same sexual partners. They are having more. They evolved to share a few alpha males. Its men who try to cope by being cucks and still marry. Women are having more sex and earlier than ever. Its fine. Just dont ask me to marry them.

&gt;My daughters are certainly not sleeping around.

Sure. And you sure know that. And its sure not going to give them FOMO, and unleash a cock carousel at all. Even if they are not, because they wouldnt tell you that, they would be an exception.

&gt; Neither did my wife.

She would tell you everything, especially in the wedding day. /s.

&gt;Rollo Tomassi did a recent post where he mentioned that the more sexual partners a women has the less likely she is to 'commit' to a relationship with a given man. I suspect there is truth in this but I don't have the experience to say. 

Its absolutely true. But its not because she is more likely to commit or stay longer, its because she is less of a mess and has less baggage, so the guy stays longer with her and she doesnt screw around. Most virgins have FOMO now, because of all the media and etc... They grow up listening to music telling them to be sluts.

&gt; I have been acquainted with plenty of women in their 30's who have focused on their career (while not 'sleeping around') then found it hard to impossible to establish a reliable relationship. T

It is very easy for women to hide their sex experience and partners. Not so easy for men. Men must go and do. Women can be very discrete.

&gt;I've got 2 sons both living at home and without girlfriends so they are kind of Mgtow

If they are mgtow, they will stand on their feet and won't get cucked or enslaved. Things are not looking good, and the system is deperate for men to enslave. 

&gt;especially one of them as he is pursuing his studies and tells me 'girls are too distracting' 

Yeah. He is not a cuck. Congrats.

&gt;""Mgtow but he doesn't agree with the politics""

There is no politics in mgtow. We have no leaders and no objectives. We are not feminism we are men, we are not here to bargain.

&gt; My younger brother could be described as Mgtow as he's never married (succession of relationships), works a seasonal job and goes travelling the other 4 months. 

With all these mgtows. You wonder why women will get in trouble. They will be desperate to get a beta cuck to help them raise some other men kids. They are all having sex with the same men, and ridden with stds.

Good luck bro.

Why are you copy/pasting the same propoganda all through the thread?

Why cherry pick. What's your actual motive here and do you actually care about emissions or are you just being cynically jingoistic?

The EU has been making intentional moves away from the usage of fossil fuels for 35 years. The CO2 emmisions for the US and EU where pretty much equal and locked togather on, moved largley by broader global forces all the way up through to  the start of the 80's and have gone in the exact opposite direction of each other once the EU started to make willfull policy changes. Up v Down respectively. [Please, take a look at the numbers.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?end=2014&amp;locations=US-EU&amp;start=1960) It's undeniable.

In absolute numbers: The US today, emits a touch over 5 million KT of CO2 annually. That's up about ~25% on the early 80's. The EU emits a touch over 3 million KT. Down ~25% of the early 80's

It's worse when you realise the EU encompasses over half a billion people.

On a per capita basis the US emits 2.5 times that of the EU. They also hold the record for highest accumulated emission by a wide margin. They have an extremely long way to go.

As above, I strongly welcome the decreases the US has made of the last decade. This is greatly welcomed (even if it is from outsourced manufacturing).

My big fear is that positions like hers are toxic knee jerk reactions that want to use reductive logic and whittle down the debate to us vs the establishment and only tearing down the establishment works. And the argument I hear all the time is : well the current system doesnt work! I get it. But no one, not Bernie, Not her not anyone on their side has come up with a workable plan for medicare for all. Instead, they just say they will make it work some how.  How? How do you plan to do this? Do you think we can just switch our system for europe just like that by a law? Its not easy. It requires a lot of sacrifice on OUR part that many of US are not ready for.  

1No fault clauses- we are a sue happy nation.  A lot but not all of the european countries dont hold doctors liable.  A lot of patients want to see doctors for everything, insist on procedures and so forth.  Only one major study looked at the cost of liability (Gawande et al) and it was a poorly done study (that more or less admitted that they picked a number out of  a hat) and this gets cited everywhere. 

2. This type of care would not be possible in Europe.  People argue doctors make too much- yet their pay here is 80 billion out of 3 trillion.  Even changing that doesnt make a difference.  

3.And besides, europe in general pays very little for professionals.  Salaried engineers make half of what people in America do.  Same with lawyers, etc.  Doctors are still among the highest paid there but that wouldnt happen here. Why would a physician want to work? You might say -so what, I dont care they make too much.  Ok but again, why would they want to work? If a doctor here is given the chance to make 90-100k as they do in Europe why wouldnt they just move to Europe where there is a shortage as well? Why would anyone spend this time training?(I know I know tehre are some countries like Switzerland that pay better- but really - look at their cost of living and their population size and all the other factors that make them very very very different from us)

4. Some here claim that its young people who are in most touch. I am a young person. 32 years. but I worked very very hard in this country and she wants hard working professionals to pay more in taxes.  Tell me why a bartender with almost no real work experience that requires a lot of hard work should lead us? Why does she get to tell us what to do?  Im not saying the current generation is correct- but this knee jerk reaction to pick someone like her rubs many of us the wrong way.  

5. Outcomes are hotly contested.  A lot of papers and reports claim that healthcare is no better in the US but this is based only lies, more lies, and statistics that mislead.  They fail to consider whether poorer outcomes in the US are due to soy and corn subsidies that make us fat or whether its really due to poorer care in the clinics.  There are very few studies out there that do look at this and when they do they find that american healthout comes are superior.  5 year survival rate for prostate ca in the US is 95%. In UK its 55%.  Is this what we want? (look up on google  UPenn economic research healthoutcomes europe vs usa)

6. Did you know that in Europe countries simply say to drug makers that if they dont like the price they will null their patent and simply remake it and sell? Did you know that almost all drug research comes out of the US? On occasion I hear about novel therapies from elsewhere like Cuba but its not as common as I wish it were.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fixes: 

1. Medicare for All is not a workable solution until one is PRESENTED. Which it hasnt been. Right now its just a statement. 
2. To pay for healthcare, why do liberals want to tax professionals? Why do they insist on this but are willing to hobnob with the ultra wealthy? Why wont they instead propose a tax against billionares and stock? Why not tax stock sales at the same income rate as salaried? I know some argue that people will just transfer wealth but thats an argument for later- there are ways to deal with this- but NO ONE wants to.  Did cynthia nixon agree to part with her many millions now and give it away? Will she live in a small 1 br apartment? What happens to her royalties today? There are so many like her - who simply want to grasp for quick fixes but find nothing. 
3. How about fixing malpractice and tort? CYA related healthcare is a large part of medical practice. If suing doctors is  really not that expensive then why not at least fund further research to truly evaluate this instead of guessing? 

I wish the responses were not: 'pah conservative blowhard nonsense' but rather a substantive conversation. I never get it.  I wish a good dialog could actually take place.

Since, if there is a subconscious racist reaction people may tend to ignore the racist intents if there are less of the individuals they are racist against, perhaps they already feel empowered and know that their views will always push ahead of the smaller ""tribes"". If their tribe is able to do well first, then they can help the smaller percent? Whereas, in the United States there are sufficient enough ""outsiders"", ""mixed outsiders"", or individuals who seem to combat the subconscious racism by supporting the ""outsiders"" to create tension in ideas with these instinctive ""own tribe before others"" individuals.

Truth is different from fact. Truth can be valid even if it’s not factual, even if it’s not ethical, because truth is subjective and fact is not. And since those of us who are not experts in a given field use truth to explain facts, things can get weird really quickly without us even realizing. 

For example, it was accepted as truth for a long time that Napoleon was super short, and because of this, he tried to conquer Europe to compensate. (I’m for sure generalizing, apologies) Now, it’s accepted that he was probably only slightly below average height for the time. Whether or not either of these ideas are factual, the term “Napoleonic Complex” exists and persists regardless. The truth behind this particular bit of history can never be categorically confirmed, but nevertheless has birthed a concept that has persisted despite its dubious origins. Such is the power of subjective truth— in the right circumstances it can virtually create something out of nothing.

I do agree with you that this is a teaching point for our culture. But maybe we disagree on the lesson.

Show me one audit of M3 money [since 2006](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M3). I really want to know who is issued money or at least how much is issued in loans. I think progressives in Congress would also like to know. It's certainly not on any public website. Oh wait, [not all loans require collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_deposit&amp;oldid=853625446) fractional-reserve deposits from the bank. With fractional-reserve, central banks can issue nine times the money they receive (also a major problem in the EU). Without fractional-reserve, they can issue infinite money.

&gt; petroleum markets are not going to somehow remove the USD as an international reserve currency.

Yet US allies are forced to reject all other currencies when selling oil, which means the buyers need USD. The strength of the USD is pinned to oil. Countries need USD to buy oil or trade with the USA. Institutional investors (bankers) and hedge funds use trading bots to constantly do arbitrage between currencies on the stock markets and crypto market. They control the market, so if they don't like that the euro is gaining dominance they can easily dump the euro to bring it down 2% within days. For a few days in October the euro/usd exchange rate stayed at 1.337 with zero fluctuation, because 1337 is a meme-level and investors thought it would be funny. Heck, I make a living by scalping 1337, 420, 666, 777 and 1000.

&gt; Oil is big, but not bigger than everything else combined.

Even though I cannot comprehend the idea behind the new GT2 category, I do think Ratel is doing a great job in running his championships. After all, he is the person responsible for the resurrection of the GT racing in the 90s, and it's continued stability ever since.

[Early next year](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/10/25/inenglish/1540464607_998634.html). Ironically, the main reason why the trial could be delayed is need to properly [address all the appeals](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/tribunales/20181201/tc-huelga-turull-sanchez-falsoque-recursos-bloqueados/357465322_0.html)

&gt; That is, what the Spanish Constitutional Court does is admit all the appeals presented (something exceptional) and then not solve them. In this way, the Court blocks the possibility that they can go to the European Court of Human Rights. Because they know perfectly well that Strasbourg would not accept this in any way, and that it would condemn Spain and force the immediate release of the prisoners.

Your affirmation that the Constitutional Court is acting in bad faith does not have any solid basis. In fact, it can be simply explained as the result of the Constitutional Court being very careful about protecting the rights of the accused. According to [this article](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/tribunales/20181201/tc-huelga-turull-sanchez-falsoque-recursos-bloqueados/357465322_0.html), they are studying all the appeals, which lack precedent, are complex and include multiple claims not only about pre-trial prison, but also about not related aspects such as freedom of ideology and the right of representation. It seems secessionists would prefer the Constitutional Court to be sloppy and not protect the rights of the accused now, so they can score a political win in a few years when the case is taken to the ECHR.

All the while labour costs are rising and robotic solutions getting better and cheaper by the minute.
Also where is agriculture from that chart? Isn't that one of the biggest sector that's going to be hit by the epidemic the hardest?

Sure be sceptical, I am sceptical too. I do think the doomsday saying that happens here often doesn't help either and it's okay to look at other sides of the coin/perspectives.

UNHCR hat ewig lang gesagt, dass sie die lokalen Flüchtlingslager nicht mehr finanzieren können, weil die europäischen Staaten ihnen kein Geld mehr schicken - ich hab dazu eh grad einen anderen Kommentar geschrieben. Die Lage in den lokalen Flüchtlingslagern war halt total unter jeder Sau - du hast aber recht, dass es dort gut möglich _sicher_ war. Ich kenn aber auch viele Fälle von Menschen, die dort absolut nicht in Sicherheit waren, und so oder so das Gefühl hatten, weiter fliehen zu müssen - ob die jetzt aber wirklich weiter _nach Ö oder D_ fliehen hätten müssen, kann ich natürlich nicht beantworten. Ich vermute natürlich, das wäre nicht notwendig gewesen. Aber nehmen wir zB Afghanen: wenn ich schon mal nach Iran fliehen musste, und dann in noch ein Land, und dann in die Türkei - wie oft will ich nochmal fliehen bis ich eine Ruhe hab? Ich kann es persönlich nicht gutheißen, aber ich kann es ein Stück weit nachvollziehen, dass ich einfach nur _weit_ weg will, irgendwo hin, wo ich ""weiß"", dass eine Ruhe ist. Und gerade Afghanistan ist halt eines dieser Atommüllendlager der internationalen Politik auf das _alle_ scheißen, seit ewig.  
Ich finde es einfach so schwierig, weil wir halt einerseits nicht die Lösung für alle Probleme finden können, aber ich finde wir können auch nicht so tun, als hätten wir nirgendwo eine Verantwortung.

Sadly it is not just us suffering on the IP piece of this. Many European countries suffer this as much, if not more than us. Countries like Germany, world renown for their Engineering, suffer greatly. 

We as a country have the most “power” to do anything about it. Sadly, I still think it’s 10 years too late. 

We created this monster and didn’t deal with it early on. Our Bankers taught China how to fund their government, businesses and how global trade actually works. The greed of our own people created China out of a need for a more sustainable manufacturing base to support our economy and we didn’t put any guide-rails in place to prevent it from becoming a larger problem. 

Simply stated the Chinese education system is just now at the point from Elementary through University where they are producing qualified and capable Scientists, Engineers and A population capable of producing unique IP. It won’t be long until it will become a race to create it first instead of a “we made it now we must keep them from finding out how” espionage issue. More pathetic than anything is they have closer to the 1.7B people than the 1.3-1.4B people they claim to have on their census due to the single child rules, so we will never win the race to IP long term if we don’t properly invest in our education system now. Think about it, at those populations they have 5 people to our 1 working on each problem. 

This “trade war” isn’t over, it is just the first step in securing our sovereignty and long term capability to succeed and sustain. 

BTW- sorry for the ones that are actually naive enough to think any of that manufacturing shift is coming back here. It ain’t happening. Unions and otherwise inflated manufacturing costs will just drive any shifts from China to other countries. It takes too long and costs way too much to setup factories here in the US. Then you add the labor costs on......here we come Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, India and Taiwan. We need your cheap labor and factories backed by Chinese banks and business owners to keep our costs down and yes you read that right. Most of these businesses in these other countries are backed by Chinese banks or investors. I’ve seen it myself for many years sourcing materials for various businesses all over the world.

Only if they took the view that brexit was a steaming pile of shit in any and all possible circumstances.  If they believed that they had been instructed to carry out brexit or, at any rate, not making a good-faith effort to do so would hurt them electorally *and* they believed that a tolerable brexit were possible then, strategically, they're more likely to get what they consider to be a tolerable brexit as government than as opposition.

(Alternatively, it's conceivable that May actually was trying to lose the '17 GE, which means she both failed to lose it convincingly and failed to win the consolation of an increased majority.)

If they believed the former but not the latter, then I would expect them to prosecute a strategy that gave the appearance of a good-faith effort to reach a reasonable compromise but one which they hoped would fail to get through Parliament in which case they'd be able to blame Labour for defeating ""the best feasible offer available"".  It'd be the only way to avoid a spanking at the polls.  Well, a worse one than they'll already get.

&gt; Perhaps they were deluded enough that they thought they could handle it and only now has the shit hit the fan are they in full panic mode. December 11th can't come soon enough.

Alternatively, May might actually think that it's a reasonable compromise in view of the referendum result which provided no strong mandate either for leaving or remaining completely.

Hard-core remainers hate it because it's not remain, hard-core leavers hate it because it doesn't cut ties with the CU, but moderates of both sides might be willing to accept it as the least worst option — ""well, at least it's not no-deal/remain [as applicable]"".

I voted leave, but I consider the May-deal to be as reasonable a compromise as I could hope to get, so I support it.  I'd rather its imperfections than remain within the Commission's political grasp.  And crucially, it is the only alternative, short of remain, that doesn't fuck up Ireland.  It also goes a long way to protecting jobs; at least, many more jobs will be lost under a no-deal scenario.

I keep hearing from hard-core leavers that we would need the EU's permission to leave the CU, but last I looked I wasn't able to find out any explanation amongst the noise of exactly why or how that would be.  I hear a lot of complaints from same to the effect that it doesn't repatriate any sovereignty, but then neither would remaining a full member state (and would expose us to future cession of competences, something I think very likely if not inevitable).

I can understand why remainers don't like it, but I can't see any good reason for leavers to object to it unless they're actually happy with the idea of no-deal chaos and WTO terms.  I'm sceptical that there's a majority within leavers for WTO terms or no deal, but then it's only the noisy hard-core that seem to be objecting at the moment.

The rest of us are just hanging onto our hats and hoping that the moderate leavers don't let the extremists make the perfect the enemy of the good, and few speak up because (as my experience in this sub shows) few will admit to voting leave or otherwise engage because it's very difficult to have a reasonable, good-faith conversation with remain supporters (or, at least, the ones who're motivated to talk about it).",True,False,False,,0,1543753610,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eax18an,False,t3_a26jwd,True,t1_eawz21i,/r/ukpolitics/comments/a26jwd/close_colleagues_of_the_pm_say_that_on_current/eax18an/,,1546315828,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,[],text,False,

At the time the Russians were too weak at to derail NATOs eastwards movement. At the time none of the countries shared a border with Russia except the Baltics. 

Then NATO considered allowing Georgia and Ukraine to enter (though France and Germany were against because they feared it would antagonize Russia)

Russia’s deputy foreign minister at the time said as much “Georgia and Ukraines membership is a huge strategic mistake which would have most serious consequences for pan-European security”/ Putin remained that admitting the two to NATO would represent a direct threat to Russia. Putin hinted “very transparently” that if Ukraine was accepted into NATO, it would cease to exist. Russia’s invasion of Georgia in ’08 should have dispelled any remaining doubts about Putin’s determination to prevent the two from joining NATO. 

Further, the West funded pro-western individuals and organizations in Ukraine in order to try and export their values to the country such as democracy promotion and civil society strengthening

When Russian leaders look at Western social engineering in Ukraine they worry that their country might be next, and such fears are not groundless. “Ukraines choice to join Europe will accelerate the demise of the ideology of Russian imperialism that Putin represents. Russians, too, face a choice, and Putin may find himself on the losing side not just in the near abroad but within Russia itself.”

This triple package – NATO enlargement, EU expansion and democracy promotion – added fuel to a fire waiting to ignite. The spark came in 2013 when Yanukovych rejected a major economic deal with the EU and decided to accept the Russian counteroffer instead. That gave rise to antigovernment demonstration that escalated over the following three months. Yanukovych fled to Russia, new government was pro-Western and anti-Russian o the core. IT is clear that Washington backed this Coup. Shortly after, Putin incorporated Crimea into Russia – Easy because there were already thousands of Russian troops in Crimea and because the majority of inhabitants in Crimea are ethnic Russians, most of whom already wanted out of Ukraine.

Putin next put pressure on the new government in Kiev to discourage it from siding with the West against Russia, making clear that he would wreck Ukraine as a functioning states before he would allow it to become a Western stronghold. Provided advisers, arms and diplomatic support to Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and massing a large army ion the Ukrainian border. Also raised the price of gas that Russia sells to Ukraine.

Putin’s actions should be easy to comprehend. Ukraine is a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia. No Russian leader would tolerate a military alliance that was Moscow’s mortal enemy with moving into Ukraine, nor would they stand idly by while the West installs a government that was determined to integrate Ukraine into the West.

This is Geopolitics 101, you may not like it but you should understand the logic to it. Great powers are sensitive to potential threats.

 **Citations on the transition's dramatic reduction of suicide risk while improving mental health and quality of life, with trans people able to transition young and spared abuse and discrimination having mental health and suicide risk on par with the general public:**

* [**Bauer, et al., 2015**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.
* [**Moody, et al., 2013**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/): The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.
* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**
* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0). Trans kids who socially transition early and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health.
* [**Dr. Ryan Gorton**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”
* [**Murad, et al., 2010**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181): ""Significant decrease in suicidality post-treatment. The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ... A meta-analysis of 28 studies showed that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment.""
* [**De Cuypere, et al., 2006**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.
* [**UK study**](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

While Sauron (a Maiar like Gandalf) and Feanor ('most talented and fiery of all the elves') could be seen as 'Luciferian' figures:

* http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sauron
* http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Feanor

When the Elves first awake in Middle-earth, the Valar propose (via emmissaries) that they depart from their origin in the East and North of the world and come to Valinor in the Uttermost West (land of the 'gods') (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacsayhuam%C3%A1n ?). Eventually, Melkor stirs up trouble within 'Heaven' itself, steals Feanor's gems and escapes - and so Feanor leads a host of exiles back east to attempt a recovery, or die in the attempt (which he does)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Rebel_Angels_%28Bruegel%29

The writer I linked to in the OP (Anand, 'Men of Renown') makes the point that he believes(-ed) the 'bringing elves west' (into the 'garden' of the Undying Lands of the Valar, represents slavery (even sex-slavery)...

* https://stolenhistory.org/threads/foundlings-and-the-orphan-trains-video-by-conspiracy-r-us.641/

...and the character complex of 'Melkor'/'Sauron'/'Feanor' represent a righteous escape from tyranny (the exile from the Garden, as it were, in a new light) - and thus 'defamed' by Tolkien's work.

* The 'Wild Hunt' of Oromë *finds* the Elves, and he then runs off to tell the Valar in the west, which then convince a good portion of Elf-kind to 'go west, young man'...

Of Feanor:

&gt; Fëanor's skills began to blossom and other than a skilled smith, he was a **linguist** and a **Loremaster**. In 1250 he devised the **lettering system** of Tengwar, improving the work of Rúmil. He then turned his mind to the study of **gems**

 ""Russian behavior in Ukraine is clearly illegal under international law. In particular, the President must make clear that the annexation of Crimea is a crime, and that sanctions will continue until Russia modifies its stance and chooses to work with the international community to resolve the situation through the process determined by the Minsk Protocol in 2014. Allowing a frozen conflict, like Georgia and Moldovia (both essentially occupied by Russia), is untenable — Ukraine is too large, important and nationalistic to permit a long-term annexation of a further chunk of their state. The President must show zero daylight between the U.S. and our NATO and European allies on this issue, or Putin will exploit the seams to continue toward achieving his ultimate strategic goal of unraveling the trans-Atlantic alliance.""

If tourism and “shopping” slow, that has a direct impact on the tourism industry’s profits. It is natural and understandable that they ask for a quick resolution to this crisis.

Lower tourism profits equals lower government tax revenues on what is 10% of GDP and 11% of jobs in France. 

That means the government would need to raise revenues elsewhere or cut services further to remain on target for EU directives. Both outcomes are essentially neutral for the government, but are very bad outcomes for what the gilets jaunes claim to represent. 

That is why I think the tourism industry is being very careful on how they phrased their points. also, keep in mind Roland Héguy is the head of UMiH, and as such is a politician responsible for the welfare of his union members. He too is worried about the impact on jobs.

Further, I think the gilets jaunes are working against their stated goals in the medium and longer term by allowing violent protests. 

You are saying the government risks further protests if they raise taxes elsewhere. I agree with you. Nonetheless, it’s precisely the past 30 years of successive governments caving in to protestors which has put France in its current difficult spot. The “rich”are already taxed more in France than most other OECD countries, and there are structural budgetary deficits that are getting worse, primarily because of creeping increases in benefits, especially “avantages acquis” for civil servants (fonctionnaires”. 

Currently, fonctionnaires make more money than similar job levels in the private sector, have job security, and often benefits or retirement packages not available to the private sector.  

Given how large the public sector is in France and how wages in the private sector have already fallen, it’s fairly clear where the cuts need to come from.

On the other hand, Luka’s natural level of talent is just too immense. Basically all kids start early in a professional setting outside the US, yet you only see one Luka Doncic. He’s one of a kind. You can’t be this skilled and cerebral at such a young age only through training hard. European greats such as Petrovic, Dirk, Gasol, Kirilenko, and Ginobili were nowhere near this level when they were 19-20. Luka just has so many shades of talent. A superhero comp would the Legion. He just needs to learn how to put all things together and become better at the same time.

As for the Lakers, I’m not sure about their superteam. I think they can be one if Ingram becomes a top 10 player.

&amp;#x200B;

Lowered expectations are just kind of the nature of global soccer, so this doesn't bother me. There are the top global teams... Bayern and Barca and Liverpool... and then there is everyone else on a sliding scale of worse-ness. For this reason, most soccer fans have the club they support through thick-and-thin, but then they have their ""big teams"". Take fans whose local teams are in the lower levels of the English system. They likely still have an association with one of the top teams, to root for when their team isn't on. CPL will be like this. Halifax will be my team, but I recognize it is a lower level of global soccer. I'll continue to root for Liverpool in European competitions and TFC in MLS, but HFX will always be the team when competing against anyone else. I dunno. Being a fan of any team that is not a top global team requires lowered expectations, and I think most soccer fans know this. Might make recruitment difficult, but in terms of lowered fan expectations I think that's very much the nature of the game in most places.

&amp;#x200B;

Long-term players, sure, but again that's the nature of soccer. Hell, that's kind of what makes soccer fun - the international nature of transfers. I do believe that there will be consistency to CPL rosters. There absolutely WILL be guys who will play a large chunk of their career with the same team. They likely won't be the superstars. But superstars leave every team in soccer. Suarez left Liverpool. Neymar left Barca. Again, it's the nature of the game. CPL definitely will struggle to keep its top talent, particularly top talent that it developed. There will be players who stay for long stints though... guys like Drew Moor and Nat Borchers in the MLS. They aren't the stars of their team, but they are of a level of quality that fits well into a CPL squad. They fill in around your superstars, and I think you'll be surprised when a few of those types of players stick around longer term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Paying for a streaming service is par for the course. I used to spend $50 every year on MLS live. I'd happily pay something similar.   


So yeah, I mean, I don't think you're wrong necessarily but I also don't think any of the problems are that different than what fans of the vast majority of global soccer teams face. The fun part of the game is that you exist in an international arena with thousands of teams at various levels, as opposed to a closed league like the NHL where you only have to worry about 31 other teams. It means that your club is unlikely to EVER be ""the best"" and that's okay.

Edit: Pasting here for easier visibility:

 **Citations on the transition's dramatic reduction of suicide risk while improving mental health and quality of life, with trans people able to transition young and spared abuse and discrimination having mental health and suicide risk on par with the general public:**

* [**Bauer, et al., 2015**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.
* [**Moody, et al., 2013**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/): The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.
* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**
* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0). Trans kids who socially transition early and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health.
* [**Dr. Ryan Gorton**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”
* [**Murad, et al., 2010**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181): ""Significant decrease in suicidality post-treatment. The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ... A meta-analysis of 28 studies showed that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment.""
* [**De Cuypere, et al., 2006**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.
* [**UK study**](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

Crimea (and Sevastopol) belonged to Ukraine, but Russia rented a port there, basically. This was essential to the Russian navy as it's their only major warm water port in the west. As Ukraine began to move closer to the EU/NATO, Russia got worried that their access to the port would disappear, hence them moving troops in there. It helps Russia's cause that the population in Crimea is 65% Russian, so they're saying they're doing it to ""protect"" the locals. 

As for what happens now: Russia is basically pushing the envelope to see how much they can get away with. To be clear, those Ukrainian boats are legally allowed to move through that strait (maritime law dictates it would be illegal to prevent access as that would constitute a blockade). Russia seizing those boats is them tightening their grip on the region, as well as seeing how strong the backlash is.

In America, after the declaration of the Mason-Dixon Line, something like 65% of slaves were owned by the Virginia Royalty, this group being comprised of our early presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, etcetera). This was until Eli Whitney invented the Steel Plow and Cotton Gin, which caused a boom in the cotton industry in the early 19th century. The slave owners began to move their plantations to the Deep South for its richer soil and better climate, as well as how they could have a larger amount of land.

These plantation owners were all white due to the fact that it would not be for another 100 years that minorities could own land.

Also, the Jewish community did not even have a substantial population in the US until _after_ the Civil War, when slavery had already been outlawed.

As for Europe, while slavery was not as common there as it was in the States, the people who owned the most slaves were _white_, and the slaves weren’t in Europe, as you can see by looking at places like Haiti.

The place that _did_ have a big problem with slavery was the early Arab (not Jewish) world, where slavery had been integrated for years.

In conclusion, the Jews were not even in America in time to have slaves, and even if they were, they wouldn’t be allowed to since they were minorities, and in Europe, the Jews didn’t touch the slave trade with a ten-foot-pole.

Diesel is the favorite fuel of transport trucks. As in Brazil about a year ago, the truckers protested the high price of diesel, practically stopping the transportation of goods within Brazil. In France they may have been undergoing something similar. Compounded by other facts though. In France and in Europe in general with the Euro zone, you have truckers taking goods across countries.

Add to it the efforts to help fight climate change and reduce the dependency on others for fossil fuel. As a country you can add subsidies to help make change.

&amp;#x200B;

PSD2 is the primary reason I became involved with ChainLink and co-founded this subreddit. For context, I work in the Financial Services sector in the EMEA region, and I can tell you it is all about PSD2. In 2019, every European Financial Institution must provide API support for payment initiation and account enquiry made by the incoming onslaught of new Fintechs.

The banking landscape in Europe will change radically in a short period as Europeans begin to take advantage of the latest technology offered by Fintechs to meet their banking needs in today's world. Blockchain technology has come along at precisely the right time, and DLT has become almost as big of a buzz-word as Fintech itself. Also, in extraordinarily good timing comes ChainLink, a service that bridges the gap between Fintechs using DLT and Financial Institution APIs.

Behind the shiny new APIs lies the prize that SmartContract have evidently positioned themselves on - legacy payment systems that will accept nothing but the payment formats they were originally designed for. This format is likely to be the new (actually &gt;15 years old) ISO 20022 XML format. Any Fintechs wishing to make use of the new APIs can bet for sure that the Banks will not be converting formats on their behalf and instead will need to submit instructions in ISO 20022 format. Through their PoC with SWIFT, ChainLink has proven themselves as being capable of not just bridging the gap, but supporting the very formats that will run the post-PSD2 banking world.

There is a lot of speculation since the PoC about a partnership with SWIFT. For me, SWIFT has already given ChainLink something very valuable; a platform on the closed stage of the Financial Services Industry. SWIFT is seen in the sector as the keeper and enforcer of best practice for financial messaging standards so when Fintechs and Banks decide which Oracle services to use, ChainLink stands poised as a service made credible by SWIFT.

It's important to note that after the introduction of PSD2 APIs, Banks and Fintechs will not require SWIFT's telecommunications to communicate and therefore can work directly with ChainLink to connect to on-chain/off-chain data.

Often people suggest firms will just build their own oracles, but the reality is Banks will not be providing this service as, unsurprisingly, they aren't going to make the job any easier for 3rd party Fintechs. Meanwhile, Fintechs are often brand new companies who are not going to be spending their start-up funds re-writing Microsoft Outlook just because they can - they will simply engage with the industry standard oracle; ChainLink.

As you can tell, I am bullish about ChainLink. Often in crypto, the old saying about how the guy selling shovels in a gold rush is the one to get rich. Well, I believe PSD2 is another gold rush and ChainLink is the first in the door selling the shovels, the diggers, and the whole wash plant.",True,False,False,,0,1543766969,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaxf397,False,t3_a2edk9,False,t3_a2edk9,/r/LINKTrader/comments/a2edk9/what_is_iso_20022_and_how_is_it_realted_to/eaxf397/,,1546322296,19,True,False,LINKTrader,t5_3om2u,r/LINKTrader,public,[],text,False,

Consensus ne veut pas non plus dire majorité.

Oui j'ai bien compris que tu n'aimait pas Zucman, mais je note aussi que tu te garde bien de parler du second papier qui montre que les fonds d'origine scandinaves ne représentent guère plus de quelques pourcents de leur PIB, alors que c'est environ 15% pour les pays d'europe continentale, et 60% pour la Russie.

Pourtant la Russie n'a pas d'ISF, et un taux d'imposition très bas, alors que les pays Scandinaves ont un taux très élevé, et pour la plupart d'entre eux un équivalent de l'ISF. Ce simple fait suffit à démontrer que l'exil fiscal ne peut être entièrement imputé à l'ISF.

Ensuite on peut regarder [ce graphique](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pO_yr6TLJPUA2sNHtKmoaG4rez-tvcp139XaFEK968KDbPmNa1KZjtmXio40flBes5aynwfhV4N46Ra9idcZdPbr4VZsotbJMttcn5SIbVdPlrncXFwKQMcosR7cWBUJFMfIwtWD

Est-ce que certains contribuables s'exilent à cause de l'ISF ? Sans aucun doute.

Est-ce que tous les exilés fiscaux sont partis à cause de l'ISF ? Ce serait très étonnant, et plus ou moins impossible à démontrer.

Est-ce que supprimer l'ISF stoppera les départs ? J'imagine qu'on le saura bientôt, mais j'en doute.

Est-ce que la suppression de l'ISF a fait revenir revenir des contribuables et à contribué à l'économie française ? [Même des députés de la majorité en doute](https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/bonnell-l-argent-de-l-isf-a-t-il-vraiment-servi-a-l-economie-29-11-2018-2275225_20.php).

True, but it's improved a *lot* since even the late 90s. I'm not saying it's perfect or there aren't areas for improvement still, but it's gone from an F-grade to a B- or maybe C+. It's not *unimportant* to me, it's just not ranked #1 or #2 anymore.

Healthcare *can* be fixed, but the only scenario in which I think we end up with single-payer is with Democrats at a 60+ majority in the Senate and control of the House and presidency. In which case they'd be shitting on our 2A rights with AWBs, mag-cap restrictions, and unconstitutional red-flag laws. I don't think we end up with single-payer in any scenario where Democrats and Republicans have to work on a bipartisan agreement. 

So, realistically, we'd be paying for single-payer with our 2A rights, and that's too high a price to pay IMO. I'd take the current system and gun rights over single-payer with CA-style gun rights to be honest. If I wanted to live somewhere with restrictive gun rights and single-payer I'd move to Europe, but that's strictly not something I'm interested in doing.

Either way, it's apparent that this sub is pretty divided between ""liberal-first, guns secondary"" people and ""guns first, liberal secondary"" folk and I fall into the latter. I've been moving more and more conservative as liberals have been proving to be just as hysterical and uninformed on issues as they believe conservatives to be. They treat gun rights just like Republicans treat abortion rights, and I believe both to be of equal importance - right to equal self defense is an aspect of bodily autonomy just as reproductive rights are. 

That's why I won't just bow down and vote Democrat across the board just because Trump is an idiot. Doing that just gives us idiots of another ilk.

I think the most interesting things are that the movement is not purely national; with propagation to Belgium and ripple effects in other EU countries, and that it is completely outside of the trade union frameworks, and not quite respectful of laws etc..., which is quite exceptional in France, although more common for protest movements in anglo countries. But yeah, the lack of leadership or organisation seems to mean the movement is like a headless chicken, and there's a lack of clear demands. There's also a lack of internal control, which makes it potentially dangerous, and it's a testimony to the state of society in France imo, a lot of people feel they aren't represented and are angry, especially against all the bodies which they feel are meant to represent them (the state, the political parties, the media, the trade unions, etc).

It's clearly due to much more structural causes than just the last taxes on gas.

Como disse, o que os estudos mostram é que raramente uma linha terapêutica é melhor do que a outra, o que é muito mais importante é a competência do profissional abordando determinada linha terapêutica. 

Quando falamos da utilização de substâncias para auxiliar no processo terapêutico me parece algo muito mais interessante em termos de medir e quantificar os resultados e até potencializar a psicologia. 

Por exemplo, os resultados do MDMA para pacientes com transtorno de estresse pós traumático são muito promissores e muitos dos pacientes que passaram pelo estudo sequer são considerados como portando TEPT 14 meses depois da terapia assistida com MDMA. 

Citei o caso do MDMA por que quando você tem um substância acelerando o processo a quantificação da melhora do paciente é significativa e aí sim pode ser realmente vista como um modelo a ser explorado pela ciência. 

É muito difícil você mensurar o resultado por exemplo de uma terapia de longo prazo por que as variáveis são tantas que chegar a conclusão de que psicanálise reduz sintomas de X% ou a terapia Junguina reduz sintomas ansioso em y% se torna impossível.

By Dag Herbjørnsrud

‘I rise to challenge you, Yajnavalkya, with two questions, much as a fierce warrior … stringing his unstrung bow and taking two deadly arrows in his hand, would rise to challenge an enemy. Give me answers to them!’ With these daring words, Gargi Vachaknavi, a Vedic female sage, launched into philosophical debate with Yajnavalkya, the semi-legendary philosopher king and the greatest sage of his day. She repeatedly confronts him with existential questions about the fundamental ontology of the world: what is it that holds the Universe together? Yajnavalkya eventually proclaims it to be ‘the imperishable [and] on this very imperishable, Gargi, space is woven back and forth’. Vachaknavi is satisfied, and she declares to the other Brahmins: ‘You should consider yourself lucky if you escape from this man by merely paying him your respects. None of you will ever defeat him in a philosophical debate.

The story of Vachaknavi’s debate is from chapter three of the oldest of the Upanishads, the Bṛihadaraṇyaka, a diverse and complex Sanskrit text on metaphysics and ethics from about 700 BCE. Vachaknavi is one of the many ‘hidden figures’ of women in the history of philosophy in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America — what is often called the Global South. Philosophers today increasingly recognise the contributions that female philosophers have made to the history of European philosophy, such as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway in the 17th century. (Indeed, the new Oxford University Press series Oxford New Histories of Philosophy might revolutionise how we look upon the history of philosophy.) But beyond Europe, female philosophers in general continue to get short shrift, and their contributions go largely unrecognised.

Vachaknavi is not the only female thinker that helped to shape the world’s oldest philosophy. Already in chapter two of the Upanishad, it is a woman, Maitreyi, who launches a discussion on the importance of one’s self (atman) to gain ‘the knowledge of this whole world’. She begins by asking Yajnavalkya (often described as her husband, but better thought of as her philosophical companion) a basic existential question of human beings: ‘If I were to possess the entire world filled with wealth, would it make me immortal?’ When he denies this, Maitreyi asks rhetorically: ‘What is the point in getting something that will not make me immortal?’ With that, the first foundation stone for the investigation of the relationship of knowledge to materialism is laid.

And then there is Sulabha, an ascetic Yogic wanderer, who wins a lengthy philosophical debate against the philosopher king Janaka in the epic Mahabharata (4th century BCE-4th century CE). The king goes quiet after Sulabha sets the record straight: ‘My body is different from yours. But my soul is not different from your soul.’

Indian male philosophers relied on their female counterparts throughout the centuries. The most famous classical Indian philosopher is perhaps Adi Shankara (788–820 CE), who formed the monistic school of Advaita Vedanta, a vital part of Hinduism that bases its arguments on the Upanishads. In biographies of him, we read how Shankara engaged in a competitive philosophical debate with Mandana Mishra of the rival school of Mimamsa, which uses only the four early Vedas. The verdict of the debate came from Ubhaya Bharati, Mishra’s wife. She, perhaps surprisingly, judged Shankara to be the champion, which had the unusual consequence of compelling her husband to submit to Shankara’s philosophical school. But then Bharati addresses Shankara: ‘You cannot claim complete success over my husband until I, his better half, have been defeated by you. Though you are an embodiment of divinity, I have a desire to debate with you.’

Shankara obeys. They debated the Vedas and the different philosophical schools for 17 days. Bharati could not beat him, but then she struck on the idea of questioning him on the Kama Sutra, the science and art of love, knowing that Shankara had been a celibate from boyhood. Shankara accepted the challenge, but requested a month-long break to the discussion so that he could study these corporeal matters to perfection. He was successful, Bharati concludes, in the manner of Vachaknavi from the Upanishads:

&gt; You took all the trouble to master the science of sex just to conform to the ways of the world. That we have met with defeat at your hands is not a matter of shame for us, just like moon and stars do not go into disrepute when the sun suppresses their light.

After the debate, Ubhaya Bharati reportedly founded her own influential school of thought.

Akka Mahadevi (c1130–60 CE) is another significant female Indian thinker. She was born in the town of Udutadi, in Karnataka, southwest India, and belonged to the Virasaiva movement, which argued for female equality, and opposed all that divides humankind, be it caste, sex, language or dress. Her radical philosophy confronted all priests, and perhaps still provokes today: ‘All the Vedas, scriptures and sacred lore, canons and codes, are but grist and husk ground in the mill.’",True,False,False,,0,1543771743,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaxn4y1,True,t3_a2cm1e,False,t3_a2cm1e,/r/Feminism/comments/a2cm1e/before_the_canon_the_noneuropean_women_who/eaxn4y1/,,1546326082,6,False,False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,r/Feminism,public,[],text,False,
