B: Characters that were explicitly white in the source material got cast to black actors. Which is a great opportunity- because adaptations don't technically owe anything to their source material- to inject some diversity and diverge from the source material to create an original work but just the fact that this sounds great tells me they wont commit to it and will instead just sit there with a dumb look on their faces while they insist that the character can be black and completely missing the point. 


C: At one point they were genuinely considering making characters that really shouldn't be black, black for no clear reason. As in, ""My dad's white as bird shit, and my mom's from a blood line of people who are basically humanoid mayonnaise so of course I'm black, why do you ask?"" no reason. 


And they did this in lieu of fleshing out the lore for an element of the universe that isn't well explained- Witcher's extended lore describes an explicitly African coded continent, and we already have people who are basically coded as Middle Eastern- and building a reason for what would compel brown and black people to move to the ass-end of racist Europe. Like, we know how Turks ended up in Germany- they came as cheap labor after the Second World War. We know how Indians speak English- there was that whole Colonial affair.

This is the exact racism and alarmism I am talking about. Economic migrants are not refugees. 

&gt;Why is that portion of the Convention along with the requirement to seek asylum in the first safe country so quickly cast aside?

Why isn't there some right to self-determination? 

&gt;Most in Spain, Italy, and Greece yes but refugees in Northern and Western Europe typically travelled over land across borders to claim asylum in more desirable states. Those people are no longer refugees, they are economic migrants.

So, you are lumping economic migrants in with refugees but then saying they are distinct. (which they are)

&gt;Refugees should be properly claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.

Yes, or apply for refugee status in a country of their choosing prior to leaving. And those that do not follow the laws should be and are denied asylum. 

&gt;Further to that, the international community needs to step in and start putting its foot down (and offering support) to countries, particularly in the middle east, that refuse to accept refugees. 

The West supports them by funding their wars and supplying their weapons. That is a great idealistic view and something that we should strive for but does absolutely nothing in the short term. When there are literal boatloads of actual refugees (and not economic migrants) who are showing up daily.

The Norway–Russia border barrier is an international border barrier built by Norway on the Norway–Russia border. Construction of the barrier began in September 2016 and took a few months. The intent of the project was to prevent the smuggling and illegal crossing of migrants from the Middle East, mainly from Syria, who have used Russia as a route of entry into Norway (and thus into the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone).

**Inner German border**

The Inner German border (German: Innerdeutsche Grenze pronounced [ˈɪnɐdɔʏtʃə ˈgʁɛntsə] or Deutsch-deutsche Grenze pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃɐˌdɔʏtʃən ˈgʁɛntsə]; initially also Zonengrenze pronounced [ˈtsɔnənˌgʁɛntsə]) was the border between the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) from 1949 to 1990. Not including the similar and physically separate Berlin Wall, the border was 1,393 kilometres (866 mi) long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.

It was formally established on 1 July 1945 as the boundary between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of former Nazi Germany. On the eastern side, it was made one of the world's most heavily fortified frontiers, defined by a continuous line of high metal fences and walls, barbed wire, alarms, anti-vehicle ditches, watchtowers, automatic booby traps, and minefields.

Also, if you were a Catholic ruler, the Church could excommunicate you and that would mean you could now be a target. Example :

&gt;When King John of England refused to accept Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury, he seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Pope Innocent III first sent a commission to negotiate with the king, and when that failed, place the kingdom under interdict. This prohibited the clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and last rites for the dying. King John responded by taking more church lands and their revenues. **Innocent threatened the king with excommunication and in 1209 proceeded to excommunicate the King**. Papal legate Pandulf Verraccio served John with notice of his excommunication in the summer of 1211. **The excommunication absolved the King's subjects from their oaths of allegiance, gave the Barons reason to revolt if they should so choose**, and allowed the King of France a pretext to invade England to remove John from power.

OB Prince of Zenobia- Same situation as above, but never got a translation patch yet.
Recommend emulation via SNES9x or Retroarch, if using a PS Vita
                 
OB64- For 3 limbs and a liver, you can probably get an original copy off Ebay. Same as above, got a Wii and Wii U release in JP and EU, but the US didn't get it. Supposedly some US versions will still download it anyway, but I haven't been able to borrow a Wii to check, meant to do that last week.

Knight of Lodis- Unlikely to get ported or remade, but runs on dang near anything. God dang this thing deserves a remake or sequel.
GBAsp (PSP, Vita), Retroarch (Vita, PC), My Boy! (Android), or just about anything will emulate it without problems. 
                          
LUCT (Old)- SNES or PS1, both of which will run you a preposterous amount of money. Release on the Japanese Playstation store allegedly, but we never got it here. PS1 version is drastically more stable if you're into challenge runs. SNES version has the CV mod.
SNES9X or Retroarch works fine, standard ISO emulation works for the PS1 version. 
                    
LUCT (New)- Available for PSP, Vita, and PSTV for $9.99. That took a while. Japanese version features 10x higher stat growth, but reduced crafting rates and...kinda improved AI, which also spends a billion years buffing. 
Download off PSN, or use a hacked verison of any of the above. Android also has emulators. OV mod works fine with all of the above as well.
                                 
To be frank, this series is obscure enough that I doubt the legality of it will ever be an issue.

&gt; Initial disputes concerning gas debts and non-payment appeared immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union.[citation needed] As a result of disputes over non-payments by Ukraine, Russia suspended natural gas exports several times between 1992 and 1994. This led to the illicit diversion of Russian natural gas exports from transit pipelines by Ukrainian companies and institutions in September 1993 and November 1994.[citation needed] The diversion of gas was acknowledged by Ukraine, while accusations of other diversions were disputed.[18]

...

&gt; A serious dispute began in March 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit. During this conflict, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation,[2][3] but later Naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached a high point on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory.

...

The system has eliminated some risk for the organisations with an intended trickle-down effect on the players, notably increasing the upper end of salaries. 

However in terms of NA rookie development, there probably isn't enough pointers toward definitively coming to the conclusion that either system particularly contributes to the development of NA rookie talent. 

Similar to when Challenger series was around there are usually one or two teams that are a clear distinction above the rest and it is debatable whether the natural skill progression of Challenger/Academy level players wouldn't have carried over to the same level of the level visible in the present, because it is a hypothetical. 

Also thinking it out logically can give rise to different conclusions based on the outset. 

E.g. ""when asking about a league dedicated to rookies and giving rookies experience or a league dedicated to imports and bottom tier veterans?"" predicates that the intent of franchising was for the rookie development and not a direct result of Reginald and co.'s organisations pressure to make the e-sport a finance and US organisation viable ecosystem. Also the beginning of the NA LCS franchising brought about the EU version of the 'korean exodus' and would have potentially happened again had not the LEC increased the spending power of European organisations by adopting the same model. Going off of the attraction of the safe-havens that western Franchised systems provide, they appear to be more-so a league dedicated to imports than their predecessor. 

Also, as mentioned previously, something currently being observed by Sebastian Park while the roster enquiries, mentioned in Hotline League, is that there seems to be a drowning out of middle-class wage/talent in the NA LCS and not the bottom. Leading to the 'Either you're a star-player, rookie (not necessarily even NA, referencing Broken Blade) or low-wage/skill tier. 

So one could also ask: A league dedicated to wage and skill inequalities or a league of uncertainty in many ways?

I will say, I agree that franchising is less flawed than the relegation system and it's good the move was made. It provides stability in many aspects. However it can be argued that this is for the organisations and that the total net benefit to the players in many aspects is arguable and uncertain until the system has been around long enough to draw proper conclusions.",True,False,False,,0,1543638341,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eau2nr2,False,t3_a1ujkl,True,t1_eatzkq9,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/a1ujkl/the_amount_of_midlane_rookie_talent_coming_into/eau2nr2/,,1546266020,1,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,[],text,False,

The network that airs Big Brother in Canada, and the production company that produces it, probably can't even do a deal with BBUS without involving Endemol in Europe.  That's my guess anyway.  It's probably much more complicated than the Canadian show saying ""hey, purchase the rights to air us in the USA"".

Another thing that people don't understand about the networks that have aired BBCan, is that GlobalTV and SliceTV fall under the same big corporation.  Originally it was Shaw Communications, but they were purchased by Corus Entertainment, I believe in Season 5.  Slice is a pay channel on cable with a very small audience, while Global is an over-the-air channel with a much wider reach.

When people say that the show was better on Slice, or Slice should make the show again, that means absolutely nothing.  Insight Productions is the company that has made the show through the entire run.  On Global, BBCan now has a much wider audience, and sponsorships now play a major part of the program.   It can never go back to cable because the audience will disappear, because Slice has such a small reach.

None are correct, none are wrong. I worked as a therapist to the elderly and although I don't have all the answers, I'll share my approach in hopes it helps you somehow.

A. So you don't want to go to the doctor.  Ok. I get that. I can think of a thousand ways I'd rather spend my time. But here's the deal. You aren't 20, 30, 40, whatever anymore and you now have health problems. So you have two paths. Go to the doctor, spare a few hours of this very long life, to make sure everything is as good as it can be so you can continue doing the things you love. A few hours here and there can ensure you live life to the fullest. I mean, think of all the time we waste in life, whats a few hours spent ensuring your life is as good as possible? Or, path 2, let your health conditions go unmonitored. CHF can lead to shortness of breath, dependence on oxygen, inability to walk, dementia, sudden death? Do you want to risk that? How many places are you going if you can't breathe and your legs are swollen?

No sale?

B. I respect your decision. I understand it takes a lot of time to prepare, the doctor is usually stressful, (or whatever fits) so here's option B. We can get a nurse to come to the home. *You may have to visit the proper doctor one more time to get this referral, depending on insurance. If you live in the EU, this should already be an option.* That way, you don't have to leave, waste much time, or get gussied up, and you still get to keep your goal of looking after your health so that you can live the best life possible.

No sale? 

C. What can I/we do for you? I'm worried about you because your conditions have some serious consequences and I can't predict how things are going or how they'll play out without a doctor's advice. What is your goal? What does your future look like? How are you going to get your prescriptions refilled? What do you want us to do if you get critically ill and...well... are suffering?

At ""C"" some people will fold and go for options A or B. Some will give you their final wishes (in that case, respect how they want to spend their final years). Some will be so far in denial they won't admit any of this is necessary.  If the latter...

D. Call whatever social service agencies are available in your state/area for the aging. Again, I'm US...so here we have a specific agency for aging in each state. You/your mom will get assigned a caseworker.  This person will help you. You need to plan for the worst and you need additional support coming in to try to reason with her. Sometimes people won't listen to family, but invite a friendly stranger over to say the exact same stuff you've been saying and suddenly it all makes sense. They never thought of it that way. Lets go to the Dr. Don't take it personal. 

There's also the possibility mom doesn't have a good connection with her doctors. I'm assuming she has a cardiologist, probably the most important one at this point. Figure out if she even likes the person and their staff. If so, trouble shoot with them. My mom can't stand waiting around. Her oxygen gets low and she's cranky in general. They try to schedule her at times there should be no problem getting in. They don't lecture her *too* hard about her diet. They do things to ensure she keeps coming back.

All I really knew of him was that he was the 41st President and previously President Reagan's VP. He may not have been the greatest, but many believed him to be a decent person. In asking this question I found a fantastic (and very long) article by the New York Times that expands on why many American approve of the 41^st president as well as his faults;^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/george-hw-bush-dies.html)

&gt;As the elder Mr. Bush watched troubles envelop the eight-year presidency of his son, however, what had been a source of pride became a cause of distress, friends said. The contrast between the two President Bushes — 41 and 43, as they came to call each other — served to burnish the father’s reputation in later years. As the younger Mr. Bush’s popularity fell, the elder Mr. Bush’s public standing rose. Many Americans came to appreciate the restrained, seasoned leadership the 41st president had displayed; in an opinion poll in 2012, 59 percent expressed approval. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, praised the father as a way of rebuking the son.

&gt;It was a subject Mr. Bush avoided discussing in public but one he finally addressed in conversations with Jon Meacham, his biographer, in a book published in 2015. Mr. Bush was quoted as saying that his son’s administration had been harmed by a “hard line” atmosphere that pushed an aggressive and ultimately self-destructive use of force around the world, and he placed the blame for that on men who had long been part of his own life and who became key figures in his son’s orbit — Dick Cheney, his son’s vice president, and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his son’s secretary of defense, with whom the elder Mr. Bush had feuded.

&gt;“I do worry about some of the rhetoric that was out there — some of it his, maybe, and some of it the people around him,” Mr. Bush said in the Meacham book, “Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.”

&gt;He was particularly critical of Mr. Rumsfeld. “I don’t like what he did, and I think it hurt the president, having his iron-ass view of everything,” he said, adding, “Rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow and self-assured, swagger.”

&gt;Mr. Bush and his sons did not attend the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate in 2016, and he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton.

&gt;...Mr. Bush was president during a shift in the world order that had begun under Reagan. His measured response to upheaval in Eastern Europe drew complaints that he was not seizing the reins of history. But he chose a collaborative approach, working with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to allow for the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The two leaders signed treaties mandating historic reductions in their countries’ nuclear and chemical weapons.

&gt;...His signal domestic decision was almost certainly the 1990 budget deal, which sought to address deepening deficits by raising taxes on the wealthy. If it helped put the nation back on solid financial footing, it nevertheless reversed one of the most explicit campaign pledges ever uttered by a major-party presidential candidate: “Read my lips. No new taxes.”

&gt;...*A Measured Aristocrat*

&gt;By any yardstick, Mr. Bush was an aristocrat, a product of moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he was instilled with an enduring sense of noblesse oblige.

&gt;As a candidate, he was known to ask his Secret Service detail to stop at traffic lights. He wrote enough thank-you notes, courtesy cards and letters of sympathy — Mr. Bush seemed to know someone in every town in America — to fill a book, literally.

&gt;That book’s title was his customary signoff, “All the Best, George Bush.” Published in 1999, it appeared in lieu of a traditional presidential memoir, which he thought would be unseemly for a man whose mother, Dorothy W. Bush, had taught him the importance of modesty.

It seems like most of the 'information' that you have gathered to build your notion of what America must be like to live in is in fact based on things that you may have seen or read in the news media. And I do not blame you. Only bad news sells and that is what CNN and other outlets make their living off of.

But until and unless you have lived here personally (and no anecdotes from your relatives or friends don't count), you do not have the right to judge what living here must be like. Yes , living in US has its downsides, such as relatively higher crime rate compared to Europe and Australia but there is nothing else, not a single freaking thing that makes US less desirable to live in than other countries including Nepal. The US state of California has a higher GDP than the entire country of Russia. The state of Texas has a higher GDP than Australia. You know what that means right? The career or job opportunities that you can get in the whole country of Australia is available just in the state of Texas. You're talking about having healthier food options in Nepal?

There's at least one public wartime assessment of Allied tanks by German troops This from the 27 June 1943 of the (Goebbels-founded) German weekly newspaper ""Das Reich."" It was later reproduced in a US Army Tactical and Technical Trends bulletin for the benefit of American officers. So, it's been filtered through quite a bit of military bureaucracy and propaganda.

http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/enemy-tanks.html

But for all that, it's an interesting read (imo, it makes it even more interesting, given its assessment of the Sherman). 

There's a bit of tank-based pop psychology: ""[the German tank testing officer] contends that the various types of tanks reflect psychological traits of the nations that produced them."" 

It's rather harsh on French tanks: ""The French have produced a number of unmaneuverable but thickly armored ""chars"" embodying the French doctrine of defense. They are conceived as solid blocks of iron to assist the troops in rendering the solidified defensive front even more rigid.""

It's bit more charitable to British tanks: ""English tanks of the cruiser class come much nearer to satisfying requirements of a proper tank for practical use in the present war."" But it's not too generous: ""The English tank is an Africa tank. It has a narrow tread chain. It did not come much into the foreground on the European continent. A tank for use in Europe, apparently, is something for which the English don't show so much talent.""

American tanks come off a bit better. The Lee ""possesses commendable motor qualities, its contours are not well balanced, and its silhouette is bizarre and too tall."" But the Sherman gets quite a bit of praise. The writer says it ""must be regarded as quite a praiseworthy product of the North American steel industry."" 

It's given good marks for ""serial construction and fulfillment of the almost arrogant requirements of the North American automobile industry as regards speed, smooth riding, and streamlined contour of the ensemble.""  Other praiseworthy features are that, ""It is spacious inside. Its aeroplane motor is of light weight. It is a series product, the same as its cast-steel coat, the latter being modeled into an almost artistic-looking contour, in such manner as to offer invariably a curved, that is a deflecting surface to an approaching bullet."" The gun stabilizer gets special attention as an ""imposing innovation.""

All in all, the Sherman of 1943 is said to ""represent the climax of the enemy's accomplishments in this line of production."" Not too bad, eh?

The T-34 is also given good grades. The author even says, ""the T-34 used by the Russians at the opening of hostilities in 1941 was at that time the best tank produced anywhere."" 

Of course, since this is a propaganda piece, the propagandist has to let the Germans win at the end, by saying, ""in Tunis, German soldiers have demonstrated their ability to deal with this tank [the Sherman]."" 

But here's the part I find really fascinating. Even that optimistic statement in the Nazi's official propaganda mouthpiece gets tempered with another admission. ""But they [German soldiers] know the danger represented by these tanks [Shermans] when they appear in large herds.""

 Feto | Foto: Thinkstock Nas últimas duas décadas, dezenas de artigos científicos sobre as origens biológicas da homossexualidade foram publicados – um deles, divulgado na semana passada, reacendeu a polêmica sobre o assunto. Mas como esta constatação se encaixa na teoria de seleção natural de Charles Darwin?

 Na música *Same Love*, que se tornou um hino não-oficial de apoio ao casamento gay nos Estados Unidos, a dupla Macklemore e Ryan Lewis, vencedores do prêmio Grammy de Melhor Artista Revelação na última edição do prêmio musical, ironiza quem diz acreditar que a homossexualidade é fruto de uma ""escolha"".

 A opinião científica parece estar do lado deles. Desde o início da década de 90, pesquisadores vêm mostrando que a homossexualidade é mais comum em irmãos e parentes da mesma linhagem materna.

 Segundo esses cientistas, isso se deve a um fator genético. Também relevantes – apesar de ainda não amplamente comprovadas – são as pesquisas que identificam diferenças fisiológicas nos cérebros de heterossexuais e de gays, assim como os estudos que afirmam que o comportamento homossexual também está presente em animais.

 Mas, como gays e lésbicas têm normalmente menos filhos biológicos do que os heterossexuais, uma questão continua intrigando pesquisadores de todo o mundo.

 ""Se a homossexualidade masculina, por exemplo, é um traço genético, como teria perdurado ao longo do tempo se os indíviduos que carregam 'esses genes' não se reproduzem?"", indaga o pesquisador Paul Vasey, da Universidade de Lethbridge, no Canadá.

 ""Trata-se de um paradoxo do ponto de vista evolucionário.""

 Muitas das teorias envolvem pesquisas realizadas sobre a homossexualidade masculina. A evolução do lesbianismo permanece muito pouco estudada. Ela pode ser semelhante ou muito diferente.

 Os cientistas ainda não sabem a resposta para esse quebra-cabeça darwinista, mas há muitas teorias em jogo e é possível que diferentes mecanismos atuem em cada pessoa.

 Conheça algumas das principais teorias a respeito do assunto:

 Genes que definem a homossexualidade também ajudam na reprodução
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Image caption  O alelo – um grupo de genes - que às vezes influencia a orientação homossexual também pode trazer vantagens reprodutivas. Isso compensaria a falta de reprodução da população gay e asseguraria a continuação dessa característica, uma vez que não-homossexuais também poderiam herdar esses genes e transmiti-los a seus descendentes.

 Há duas ou mais maneiras pelas quais esta transmissão dos genes pode acontecer. Uma possibilidade é que este grupo de genes crie um traço psicológico que torne os homens heterossexuais mais atraentes para mulheres, ou as mulheres heterossexuais mais atraentes para os homens.

 ""Sabemos que as mulheres tendem a gostar de traços e comportamentos mais femininos nos homens e isso pode estar associado com coisas como o talento para ser pai e a empatia"", diz Qazi Rahman, coautor do livro *Born Gay; The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation* (""Nascido Gay, A Psicobiologia da Orientação Sexual"", em tradução livre).

 De acordo com essa teoria, uma quantidade pequena desses alelos aumentaria as chances de sucesso reprodutivo do portador desses genes, porque o torna atraente para o sexo oposto.

 De vez em quando, um membro da família recebe uma ""porção"" maior destes genes, que se reflete na sua orientação sexual. Mas porque este alelo traz vantagens reprodutivas, ele permanece no DNA humano através das gerações.

 Gays seriam 'ajudantes no ninho'
--------------------------------

 Alguns pesquisadores acreditam que, para entender a evolução dos homossexuais, é preciso observar qual é o papel que os gays têm nas sociedades humanas.

 A pesquisa de Paul Vasey em Samoa, na Polinésia, baseou-se na teoria da seleção de parentesco ou hipótese do ""ajudante no ninho"".

 A ideia é que os homossexuais compensariam a falta de filhos ao promover a aptidão reprodutiva de irmãos e irmãs, contribuindo financeiramente ou cuidando dos sobrinhos. Partes do código genético de um gay são compartilhadas com sobrinhas e sobrinhos e, segundo a teoria, os genes que determinam a orientação sexual também podem ser transmitidos.

 Vasey ainda não mediu o quanto que ser homossexual aumenta a taxa de reprodução dos irmãos, mas comprovou que em Samoa, homens gays passam mais tempo fazendo ""atividades de tio"" do que homens heterossexuais.

 ""Ninguém ficou mais surpreso que eu"", disse Vasey sobre suas descobertas. Seu laboratório já havia comprovado que homens gays no Japão não eram mais atenciosos ou generosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas do que homens e mulheres heterossexuais sem filhos. O mesmo resultado foi encontrado na Grã-Bretanha, nos Estados Unidos e no Canadá.

 Vasey acredita que o resultado em Samoa foi diferente porque os homens que ele estudou lá eram diferentes. Ele pesquisou os fa'afafine, que se identificam como um terceiro gênero, vestindo-se como mulheres e tendo relações sexuais com homens que se consideram heterossexuais. Os fa'afafine são parte de um grupo transgênero e não gostam de ser chamados de gays nem de homossexuais.

 O pesquisador especulam que parte da razão pela qual os fa'afafine são mais atenciosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas é sua aceitação na cultura de Samoa, em comparação com os gays no Ocidente e no Japão. A lógica é a de que gays que são rejeitados tendem a ajudar menos os familiares a criarem seus filhos.

 Mas ele também acredita que há alguma coisa no estilo de vida dos fa'afafine que os torna mais propensos a serem carinhosos com seus sobrinhos e sobrinhas. E especula que encontrará resultados semelhantes em outros grupos de ""terceiro gênero"" ao redor do mundo.

 Se isso for comprovado, a teoria do ""ajudante no ninho"" pode explicar em parte como um traço genético da atração pelo mesmo sexo não foi excluído dos humanos ao longo da evolução.

 Mesmo com uma menor capacidade de se reproduzir, homossexuais que se identificam como um ""terceiro gênero"" ajudariam a aumentar a capacidade reprodutiva de seus parentes heterossexuais, ao assumirem cuidados com as crianças.

 Homossexuais também têm filhos
------------------------------

  Image caption  Nos Estados Unidos, cerca de 37% da população lésbica, gay, bissexual e transsexual [ têm filhos](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/lgbt-parenting-in-the-united-states/), 60% dos quais são biológicos. De acordo com o Instituto Williams, casais gays com filhos têm, em média, dois.

 Estes números podem não ser altos o suficiente para sustentar que traços genéticos específicos ao grupo sejam passados adiante, mas o biólogo evolucionista Jeremy Yoder lembra que durante boa parte da história moderna, pessoas gays não viveram vidas abertamente homossexuais.

 Obrigadas pela sociedade a casarem e terem filhos, suas taxas reprodutivas devem ter sido mais altas do que são hoje.

 Medir a quantidade de gays que têm filhos também depende de como você define ""ser gay"". Muitos dos homens heterossexuais que têm relações sexuais com os fa'afafine em Samoa casam-se com mulheres e têm filhos.

 ""A categoria da atração pelo mesmo sexo se torna muito difusa quando temos uma perspectiva multicultural"", diz Joan Roughgarden, um biólogo evolucionista na Universidade do Havaí.

 No Ocidente há indícios de que muitas pessoas passam por uma fase de atividade homossexual, mesmo que sejam principalmente heterossexuais.

 Isso tornaria mais complicado afirmar que somente pais que levam uma vida homossexual poderiam passar ""genes gays"" adiante.

 Nos anos 1940, o pesquisador de sexo americano Alfred Kinsey descobriu que apenas 4% dos homens brancos eram exclusivamente gays após a adolescência, mas 10% dos homens tiveram um período de atividade gay de 3 anos e 37% tiveram relações com alguém do mesmo sexo em algum momento de suas vidas.

 Uma pesquisa nacional de atitudes em relação ao sexo feita na Grã-Bretanha em 2013 apresentou número mais baixos. Cerca de 16% das mulheres disseram ter tido alguma experiência sexual com outra mulher (8% tiveram contato genital) e 7% dos homens disseram ter tido alguma experiência sexual com um homem (5% tiveram contato genital).

 Mas a maior parte dos cientistas pesquisando a evolução gay estão mais interessados na existência de um padrão de desejo interno contínuo. Identificar-se como gay ou heterossexual não é tão importante, nem ter relações homossexuais com maior ou menor frequência.

 ""A identidade sexual e os comportamentos sexuais não são boas medidas da orientação sexual. Os sentimentos sexuais, sim"", diz Paul Vasey.

 Nem tudo está no DNA
--------------------

 Qazi Rahmandiz afirma que grupos de genes que determinam a atração pelo mesmo sexo só explicam parte da variedade da sexualidade humana.

 Outros fatores biológicos que variam naturalmente também interferem. Um em cada sete homens, por exemplo, devem sua sexualidade ao ""Efeito Big Brother"": observou-se que garotos com irmãos mais velhos têm maiores chances de serem gays - cada irmão mais velho aumentaria as chances de homossexualidade em cerca de um terço.

 Ainda não se sabe o porquê, mas uma teoria é a de que a cada gravidez de um bebê do sexo masculino, o corpo da mulher desenvolve uma reação imunológica a proteínas que tem um papel no desenvolvimento do cérebro masculino.

 Como isto só interfere de alguma forma no bebê depois que muitos irmãos já nasceram - a maioria dos quais serão heterossexuais e terão filhos - esta peculiaridade pré-natal não foi descartada pela evolução.

We know that offering a small reward for basically nothing (like logging in) and then offering a bigger reward for a significant investement is a standard gambling mechanic.

They start by giving shit with playing naturally, to ensure you will either a) spend thousands of hours or b) spend hundreds of dollar. Blizzard uses the same tactic with Diablo for instance. There's a reason some of their games are under investigation from the EU gambling commission. It's immoral business practice, and it's why I refuse to buy anything from them. To be fair, Valve had the same problem with lootboxes for Dota in the Netherlands, and they changed their lootboxes (luckily, those are just cosmetic). 

Valve just doesn't want to go down that road, period. They've said so in several video's that they don't want to have a gambling game. 

I agree that it's not ideal to have a system that rewards people who invest money in a skill-based game. However, the competitive players will win free card packs AND free tickets. Plus, the 'investment' needed to get a competitive deck is not that high from what I've seen. So I disagree that there's no slow progress.

Você falou que eu não pago nada pra ir no posto de saúde. Mas claro que eu pago, eu pago imposto.

Seria o mesmo que dizer que eu não pago nada ao usar meu plano de saúde privado, só porque paguei antes de usá-lo.

Ou nunca usou um plano de saúde privado sem participação? Eu já fiz inúmeros exames e consultas sem pagar ""nada, 0, free"", porque tava pagando mensal.

&gt;E quando eu falei de o custo do tratamento ser barato não to falando de quanto a pessoa tem que desbancar, mas os custos totais, contabilizando o que é pago por impostos, o SUS gasta 1/8 do preço que um plano privado diz gastar num tratamento de AIDS.

E eu te dei as razões do porque eu vejo isso acontecer, e to esperando o seu caso.

Não existe ""livre mercado"" de tratamento de AIDS quando todo mundo é obrigado a pagar pra alguém que oferece subsidiado (sem custos nesse caso).

Seria como o governo abrir uma entregadora de cartas, subisidá-la e falar ""tá vendo as outas entregadoras de cartas, são bem mais caras"". Claro que são, elas não conseguem crescer e atingir economia de escala porque não há demanda pra isso.

&gt;porque isso tornaria o preço mais barato? se é feito por imposto e licitação publica eles não poderiam simplesmente inventar um custo alto pra superfaturar as coisas, como é ""feito em tudo que envolve o governo""?

Três motivos:

1- dinheiro da saúde é mais escasso do que em outras áreas do governo

2- é mais fácil otimizar um processo rigido como esse

3- é algo que chama muita atenção, tanto que você defende isso

&gt;Se o seu argumento é que ""sem sermos roubados pelos impostos as coisas seriam mais baratas"" tome um pouco de cuidado, porque o barato sempre sai caro.

Repara que eu não to pedindo pelas coisas baratas. Eu to pedindo pra ter opção e pagar o preço real delas.

&gt;Inclusive, eu sei que você ficou com preguiça de pesquisar mas eu repito pra você:

É uma questão completamente irrelevante. Não existe nada que uma iniciativa Estatal pode fazer que uma iniciativa privada não pode, exceto cobrar imposto e mudar as regras em seu favor.

Se você quer argumentar em favor do Estado, tem que me mostrar ou algo que o Estado pode fazer pra baratear o custo que uma iniciativa privado não é capaz, ou como cobrar imposto ou mudar as regras em seu favor é bom pra nós.

E pra te saciar, eu cheguei a fazer uma pesquisa rápida na hora, mas encontrei só um PDF sobre os custos do SUS em 1996, se você acha que essa informação contribui em algo pra discussão você pode trazer ela ao invés de criar esforço desnecessário.",True,False,False,,0,1543663178,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eauj75p,False,t3_a1thvq,True,t1_eatffnb,/r/brasilivre/comments/a1thvq/mamãefalei_errou_e_feio/eauj75p/,,1546273730,1,True,False,brasilivre,t5_351wl,r/brasilivre,public,[],text,False,

French &amp; German MEP's, (who have the largest block in the EU Parliament - about to get larger due to Brexit), are also pushing a law that would **ban** EU companies and financial institutions from complying with US sanctions on Iran, just to protect their business interests and keep the cheap oil flowing. Whatever you think of Trump, the US and Iran - This will fuck EU companies because they now have to decide who they want to be permanently banned for trading with for life **and** have billions in fines placed on them, the US or EU? Wow what a great economic choice.

The UK meanwhile spearheaded the sanctions against Russia, even ahead of the US, and even despite our financial industry being the biggest EU industry to take the first hit, and we're even pushing for more harsher sanctions on an EU / UN level, which guess who... Germany and France are vetoing. The UK was also the first country to place a battalion of infantry in Eastern Europe in response to Russia's invasion and illegal annexation of part of Ukraine, we had soldiers and aircraft in Poland within weeks.. What did Germany do? Oh that's right, complain we are provoking Russia and everyone needs to ""calm down"", the identical statement they just gave about the recent illegal actions last weekend by Russia in the Azov Sea.

With friends like that, who needs enemies?

3. We use *race* to describe appearance and that's it. Some records use the word ""tez"". The words white, black, trigueño, jabao, and moreno are used as rough informal descriptors of physical appearance. Many of those terms don't appear on the census.

4. Most Puerto Ricans are predominantly European in terms of genetic composition so most Puerto Ricans default to *white* even if by some standards they're *light brown*.

 Sessão do STF durante julgamento de ação direta de constitucionalidade sobre indulto natalino - Pedro Ladeira/Folhapress A lista de 22 condenados que seriam beneficiados pelo [indulto de Michel Temer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-dara-indulto-na-presidencia.shtml), divulgada pela força-tarefa da Lava Jato, causou controvérsia no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal). Magistrados receberam documentos dizendo que, do total de réus, 14 já estão soltos ou em prisão domiciliar.

 Ministros afirmam que estes condenados já estariam usufruindo de penas mais brandas e até da liberdade não graças a Temer —mas a benefícios que o próprio Ministério Público Federal concedeu a eles, depois de acordos de delação premiada.

 Entre os citados como possíveis perdoados na lista da força-tarefa está o [ex-doleiro Adir ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/ccr-faz-acordo-e-cita-doacao-via-caixa-dois-para-alckmin-e-serra.shtml)[Assad](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/ccr-faz-acordo-e-cita-doacao-via-caixa-dois-para-alckmin-e-serra.shtml). Condenado no total a mais de 30 anos de prisão, no Rio e no Paraná, há dúvida inclusive se ele poderia ser alcançado pelo indulto.

 Assad está solto desde outubro. Ele cumprirá mais dois anos de pena no regime semiaberto, com recolhimento domiciliar noturno e tornozeleira. Depois, prestará cinco anos de serviço comunitário.

 Já Dalton Avancini, ex-executivo da empreiteira Camargo Corrêa, também citado, foi condenado a 15 anos de prisão e ficou na cadeia por apenas quatro meses. Em 2015, celebrou acordo de colaboração. Passou para regime domiciliar. Desde março está solto, sem tornozeleira, prestando serviço uma vez por semana numa vara de Justiça.

 A obrigação que ele terá, por 11 anos, é a de fazer relatórios trimestrais sobre a vida que leva. Se for atingido pelo perdão de Temer, a única mudança prática em sua vida será não ter mais que escrever o documento.

 [Geddel Vieira Lima](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/11/supremo-adia-para-quinta-julgamento-sobre-indulto-de-temer.shtml), que não está na lista da Lava Jato mas também foi apontado como exemplo de condenado que seria beneficiado, não foi ainda nem sequer julgado. Por isso, não poderia ser perdoado.

 O indulto, de qualquer forma, seria bem-vindo mesmo para os condenados que já estão soltos. Com ele, todos voltariam a ser réus primários e não teriam mais que dar satisfação à Justiça.

 [  ](https://fotografia.folha.uol.com.br/galerias/nova/1618599352692630-bastidores-do-show-de-gilberto-gil-em-sp#foto-1618599352785056)Bastidores do show de Gilberto Gil em SP “Cadê o resto dos musos e das musas?”, perguntou a empresária Flora Gil, no camarim do Teatro Bradesco, em São Paulo, na quinta (29). Poucos minutos antes, seu marido, o cantor Gilberto Gil, tinha deixado o palco depois do show de lançamento do álbum “Ok, Ok, Ok”.

 Os “musos e musas” são os amigos do compositor que inspiraram canções de seu novo CD: os médicos Roberto Kalil (“Kalil”) e Roberta Saretta (“Quatro Pedacinhos”) e a jornalista Andréia Sadi (“Lia e Deia”).

 “Você viu que ele cantou a sua musiquinha por 30 segundos e a minha foi o show inteiro, né?”, brincou Kalil com Saretta. O médico gravou com seu celular o momento em que Gil tocou a faixa na apresentação.

 O artista falou com a coluna sobre a cultura no Brasil no futuro governo.

 “Já houve experiências nesse sentido [sobre o fim do MinC como ministério isolado]. A articulação com as secretarias de cultura nos estados e municípios é muito importante, acho que até mais importante do que ter um ministério para chamar de seu [risos]. É preciso uma gestão para chamar de sua.

 Eu entendo que há uma certa decepção na classe, no setor, porque isso [fim do MinC] soa como um ‘downgrade’, né. Acho que vai depender muito da sensibilidade do ministro e da visão que o presidente tenha da questão cultural. Todo mundo da cultura vai estar prestando atenção.”

 Mais uma mudança no secretariado do prefeito Bruno Covas: Caio Megale deixa a secretaria da Fazenda. Philippe Duchateau assume em seu lugar.

 Antonio Palocci deixou Curitiba por volta das 21h da quinta (29). O motorista do ex-ministro foi buscá-lo de carro e ele chegou em seu apartamento, no bairro dos Jardins, em SP, na madrugada desta sexta (30). Palocci ficou preso por dois anos na capital paranaense.

 A possível vinda do presidente americano, [Donald Trump, para a posse de Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/11/bolsonaro-tem-alinhamento-internacional-cego-a-gestao-trump-critica-haddad.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/11/bolsonaro-tem-alinhamento-internacional-cego-a-gestao-trump-critica-haddad.shtml) será confirmada perto do dia 18 de dezembro. Essa é a data em que está prevista a vinda da equipe do FBI ao Brasil para reconhecer o espaço do evento.

 Bolsonaro pode não dar a volta na Esplanada dos Ministérios a bordo do Rolls Royce presidencial, como fizeram os outros ex-presidentes no dia da posse. A equipe que prepara a festa analisa a possibilidade de ele sair da residência oficial em carro fechado e ir direto subir a pé a rampa do Congresso Nacional.

 Militantes da Marcha da Maconha de SP pediram asilo político ao Consulado do Uruguai, que [regulamentou a venda da droga em 2017](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/sobe-66-o-numero-de-homicidios-no-uruguai-por-causa-do-narcotrafico.shtml). “Se eles aceitarem que brasileiros pacientes terapêuticos da maconha podem viver lá em condições de asilados políticos, tem gente da marcha que gostaria de ir”, afirma Gabriela Moncau, integrante do movimento.

 “Nos fazemos aqui presentes para solicitar asilo político em seu país, uma vez que nosso Estado nos persegue politicamente e ameaça nossas vidas ao não permitir o acesso legal e regulamentado ao uso terapêutico da maconha”, diz o documento.

 A professora de arte contemporânea Julia Bryan-Wilson, os curadores Thomas J. Lax e Mathieu Copeland, o coreógrafo Ismael Ivo e as artistas Carmen Luz e Cláudia Müller vão participar do seminário internacional “Histórias da Dança”, que ocorre no dia 12 de dezembro, no Masp, em São Paulo.

 O bloco carnavalesco Acadêmicos do Baixo Augusta será homenageado com a Salva de Prata, uma das comendas mais importantes do município, que é concedida pela Câmara Municipal. A entrega será feita na abertura do Festival do Baixo Augusta, no dia 2 de fevereiro.

 O crítico Amir Labaki esteve no lançamento do livro “Faz Pouco Tempo”, do jornalista Roberto Muylaert, realizada no Itaú Cultural, na quinta (29). O diretor do Itaú Cultural, Eduardo Saron, também passou por lá.

1. The Wall
2. Level the internet playing field by forcing tech companies to either own their content or stop censoring conservatives 
3. Strike the final blow against the failing mainstream media by showing they are leftist shills who hate everyday Americans
4. Tell America who was behind WTC7 collapsing when it wasn’t hit by an airplane 
5. Enforce the law on hiring illegal aliens (how many of you filled out those forms establishing your legal right to work, and backed it up with a driver’s license, Social Security card, and birth certificate)
6. Investigate and stop both voter fraud (illegal alien voting) and election fraud (deliberately miscounting or creating fraudulent ballots)

Assume these things don’t happen because of the Democrats and GOPe deep state allies. Then assume the leftists win in 2020 or 2024. Now imagine the laws and 1984-type state they will impose. We will see the FBI and IRS working with “helpful tips” from Google (your search history) and Facebook / Google / Amazon / Apple (your social media activity and text messaging), all in line with what the ACLU and SPLC say is hateful speech against THEIR VIEW of American values. Oh yeah, they will come for your weapons, too. 

The doubters need only watch what’s happening around us. The Clinton Foundation whistleblower’s home is raided. ANTIFA publishes Tucker’s home address. More and more conservative accounts on social media or YouTube (read: Google) are dropped or lose their ability to make money. 

The response to this police state won’t be pretty. Watch Europe over the next few years for a preview. At some point, Germany will fracture. Shit’s gonna look really ugly when it does. 

President Trump has one good opportunity in the best two years to reverse these trends. After watching how the fake Russia investigation with Mueller and Rosenstein have tied his hands, the future doesn’t look good. We would be wise to prepare for leftist control and mob violence.

The third match of the Zula Europe Pro League took place against the VirtuE, the first classified for the Pro League through the Qualifying Tournaments, against the aliens of the Spanish Esports Organization, x6tence.The maps chosen were Old Town and China.In the first map the Polish players showed a great level against the Spanish organization obtaining a result of 10 - 3. The MVP of this game was b07a, which carried out key kills for the victory of his team and obtained a KDA of 2.37 (15/8/4). The team of x6tence carried out a quite bad defense turn in which they conceded 6 rounds to VirtuE, which meant the defeat in the match after 3 attacks in vain very well defended by the Polish team.On the second map we could see a completely reversed situation. x6tence, which started attacking, ended up defeating the polish players with a result of 10 - 3. In this case the MVP was hunteR, with a KDA of 2.5 (13/8/7). x6tence managed to score seven rounds in his turn of attack, which put in a very compromised situation the Polish players, who could not do anything against the superb defense of the aliens, who only conceded a round in defense before reaching the victory.The final result was 1 - 1, which means 1 point for each team in the Zula Europe Pro League classification.Videos:VirtuE vs x6tence - Map 1VirtuE vs x6tence - Map 2General statistics:Virtuecontrax6.jpg

2- r/europe makes it sound like Byzantines never disappeared and that they were never conquered by Turks, a nomadic people whose elites were thoroughly Persianized, but instead Turks became them. Which is denying our history. I saw that in the infamous Ottoman thread. A guy literally claimed we were just muslim Byzantines and got 70 upvotes. Not that upvotes here actually have any value. But it showed that a lot of people unironically believe that. And that he actually tried to support his claim with genetics and literally said that Byzantines and Ottomans were the same empires (which was immediately debunked by me).

3- No historian says Ottomans were culturally Byzantine. Instead, Ottomans are seen as the last member of Turko-Persian tradition. 

I wonder. Why is r/Europe so obsessed with us? You say we're not European but at the same time you're constantly trying to link us to our former enemies who were without a doubt European.

La vida de la marroquí Najwa Awane cambió desde que un perro de raza Pitbull la mordió y tuvo que ser amputada su pierna izquierda. Se tomó esa decisión para salvar su vida, después de 17 cirugías que soportó durante 42 días que permaneció en un hospital español.

Awane, de 22 años, compite por primera vez en Sudamérica y lo hace en Cuenca, con motivo del Torneo Internacional Tennis Tour ITF, Ecuador Open 2018. Es siembra uno del certamen tenístico en silla de ruedas y se ubica en el puesto 37 del ranking mundial.

La africana integra el grupo de 25 tenistas que participan en las canchas del Cuenca Tenis y Golf Club, en representación de Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Marruecos, México, Perú y Ecuador. Cada deportista tiene su historia, pero todos luchan por demostrar a la sociedad que no existen límites cuando existe voluntad.

Awane, durante su año de rehabilitación en Cádiz, España, aprendió español. Viajó a ese país en compañía de su madre, Laripa Karam, con la ayuda del club de Atletismo Chiclana. Ella, antes de la agresión del perro, era atleta. A más de español habla árabe, francés e inglés. Tiene el título en la especialidad de Matemáticas.

La tenista marroquí, antes de los cotejos, suele hablar con sus rivales. Lo hizo con las sudamericanas, el 30 de noviembre del 2018. Por ejemplo, dialogaba con la colombiana Zuleiny Rodríguez y la peruana Lucia Isisola Solís. La primera compite por segunda vez en la capital azuaya y la segunda es debutante.

Rodríguez, de 17 años, es novia del chileno Alexander Cataldo, siembra uno del Torneo Internacional de Cuenca y 23 en el escalafón mundial. Se conocieron hace 14 meses en Sao Paulo, Brasil, durante un certamen. Él, antes de su partido de ayer, le brindó algunas indicaciones en la cancha.

La discapacidad de Rodríguez es de nacimiento, tuvo una malformación congénita de los miembros inferiores y al año tres meses le amputaron las piernas. Desde los dos años usa prótesis. “Gracias a Dios he podido salir adelante y he viajado a Holanda, Brasil, Chile, Perú…”. Su sueño es ser la número uno del mundo.

Cataldo, de 20 años, tiene innumerables competencias en el exterior, pero este año se lució al conseguir un título europeo en Holanda. Desde el 2008, cuando empezó jugar tenis en silla de ruedas, ha visitado Japón, Francia, Bélgica, entre otros países. Su objetivo es ubicarse entre los 10 mejores del planeta.

Ecuador, como anfitrión, tiene una delegación de siete tenistas y uno de ellos es Wladimir Alulema, quien se vinculó a este deporte hace siete años. Él jugaba fútbol en la Sub 14 de Liga de Quito, pero un accidente de tránsito registrado hace 10 años en Atacames lo alejó de las canchas.

Sufrió una lesión medular, con fractura completa de la medula espinal. Cuando recibía rehabilitación, en el Ministerio del Deporte de ese entonces, fue invitado a practicar tenis adaptado y aceptó con gusto. A sus 32 años recuerda que “fue duro usar silla de ruedas luego de ser caminante, pero es una oportunidad que me dio la vida”. Es supervisor de la construcción.

Uno de los novatos del torneo es el peruano Jorge Beltrán, de profesión economista. Incursionó hace un año en el tenis adaptado y considera que sus rivales le llevan una gran ventaja. Hace nueve años, haciendo un salto en la nieve cayó mal y quedaron inmovilizadas sus piernas. Antes competía en bicicleta con pedal de mano.

La mayoría de los tenistas que competirá en Cuenca, hasta mañana, llegó con la meta de sumar puntos para los Juegos Parapanamericanos del 2019 en Perú. De allí se proyectarán con miras a los Juegos Paralímpicos en Tokio 2020.

En el caso de la tenista marroquí, después de competir en la capital azuaya viajará a su país. En tres semanas viajará a Málaga, España, en donde hará su cuartel de prácticas para los Juegos Paralímpicos.

He wants to move to Europe forever (which is another issue within itself, I think he wants to escape), and I don’t want that but agreed to move there for under 10 years. That wasn’t good enough for him. So, we had to call it quits because we were both unhappy. I’m focusing on myself and focusing on what I want out of life. I picked up a new hobby: yoga.

Box all of their stuff away, put pictures onto a flash drive, cry until you can’t cry anymore, feel ALL of the feelings that your heart wants you to feel. Grieve. Don’t push the big scary feelings away. My biggest advice is: take the time to grieve. Don’t rush it. Everyone grieves differently. I’m still grieving and frankly, I don’t know when it will end, and that’s okay.

I'm from that interim generation who grew up with Star Wars on TV and in video but who only got to see them in a cinema when the Special Editions came out. The EU was important to me as that's where ALL of the Star Wars stories outside the films lay. 

I enjoyed the EU but I'm more thankful that were getting new post-rotj films and I'm  loving them. The Last Jedi was brilliant for me. I absolutely loved it as a Star Wars film which I feel was the first one to really say something (well,  a lot of things) since the originals. Yes, the prequels had their messages. But they were ones I found a bit uninteresting it obvious (perhaps because - especially ROTS - came out in a certain political climate). I feel like TLJ got down to some core humanity rather than societal commentary and I appreciate that.  And arguably (actually unarguably, in my opinion) the weakest part of that film is Canto Bight where the lessons are very obvious (slavery is bad, animal cruelty is bad, war profiteering is bad).

This time though I saw him walk into the bar by himself.  It appeared he had a couple of friends in the bar but I was able to catch him in a moment by himself. I walked right up to him and stuck out my hand and said “i just want to shake your hand and thank you for playing in Bend a couple summers ago” he said “yeah man it was really cool to play here” he then asked me my name and he said “nice to meet you Pat, my name is Chino”  

I asked him if they plan on coming back to Bend and he said “we really want to in the next 1-2 years but nothing is set in stone yet”.  I then said “you guys really set the bar high because Bend never got any rock shows or metal shows before and now Mastodon was here over the summer” he said “I know man i was super bummed I missed that show, we just got back from Europe the next day and I was bummed I missed out on them and Primus”.  A couple more words were exchanged and then I said it was a “pleasure meeting you” and he said “likewise” and he extended his fist out for a fist bump and that was it. It was about a 3 min interaction. I didn’t ask for a photo or autograph and although I was a bit nervous I really did my best to maintain my composure. I hope to see him around town again cause now I’ll just say what’s up and give him a fist bump. If he remembers my name I will die a happy person.

In order to sell a drug in the US, you need a marketing application with extensive info on the product quality, safety, and efficacy. Not only does the mountain of evidence take years (even decades in some cases) to obtain and distill into an organized package, FDA application reviews and inspections can take over a year on top of the time (and money) spent to meet with FDA and respond to questions. Regulatory philosophies between the US, EU, CAN, and JP differ in many ways, so a drug approved and manufactured in Spain might not meet the requirements set forth by FDA. You might be required to conduct additional clinical trials or alter your manufacturing process, which can be particularly burdensome since it would need to be justified to the other countries where a product is marketed.

Without appropriate IP protections, companies would have fewer incentives to develop new drugs as the risk of development and registration might not be worth it if there's no guarantee of some exclusivity. Trying to find a balance between fostering new drug development and ensuring patients are able to afford life saving medications by passing laws without considering the nuances of the regulatory and legal environments can raise more problems than before.

A frequent criticism of our legislature is that lawmakers pass laws on issues they don't fully understand that could hamstring agencies from working with industry and patient advocacy groups to develop policy and enforce existing legislation.

There is no evidence that worship was limited to a single deity associated with a city, although cities did have patron or namesake deities.  In fact, the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians all worshipped basically the same set of deities despite cultural differences.  Likewise, the ancient Egyptians had an incredibly large pantheon of gods.  In Egypt, pharaoh Akhenaten attempted to impose a monotheistic belief in Aten, the sun disc, but this shift from the earlier polytheism to monotheism was not widely accepted by the ancient Egyptians as evidenced by the desecration of Akhenaten's images and capital city, Armana, after his 17 year reign ended.  In ancient history terms, monotheism does not emerge until Judaism and Zoroastrianism in about 1000 BCE.  One thing I do find interesting is the large numbers of small carved female figures found throughout much of Europe, dating back to 30,000 to 22,000 BCE, such as the Woman of Willendorf.  These may represent a belief in a fertility goddess, but it is not known for certain that these figures were meant to represent a deity.

False,xbettel,1418736883.0,,,,,,t2_k2bdl,"&gt; BURLINGTON, Vt. — By now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has gotten used to supporters urging him to run for president in 2020; at rallies, at airports, on his weekday walks to the Capitol. At a Friday night gathering here, Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis went further: Only Bernie Sanders could save the world.

&gt; **“Let me convey a message from all of us in Europe, for all those comrades of yours who are now struggling to reclaim our cities, our world, our world, our environment,” Varoufakis said. “We need Bernie Sanders to run for president.”**

&gt; The senator from Vermont, who is actively discussing whether to mount another campaign, smiled and closed the session. But over three days at the Sanders Institute’s inaugural conference, the senator and his supporters described a democracy under attack by populist right-wing forces as compromise-hungry “neoliberals” lacked a vision to defend it — a dynamic they see as leading to President Trump’s win in 2016.

&gt; Even as Democrats won back the House of Representatives last month, some high-profile left-wing candidates fell short, a dynamic Sanders struggled with; he opened the weekend conference by saying the party could have done better. For the senator and his supporters, it was clear that Democrats had squandered power when they last held it, leading to a surge of right-wing nationalism. To avoid a repeat, the left needed to organize — preferably, many here believe, with Sanders in the White House.

&gt; **“Neoliberal establishments are collapsing, not just here, but around the world,” said Cornel West**, a crusading academic who endorsed Sanders in 2016 and backed the Green Party’s campaign when Sanders lost the primary. “The only thing presented [to people] that has some credibility is vicious, authoritarianism fascism. If we don’t have a left populism that’s credible, we’re running down a fascist road.”

&gt; West, who has encouraged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate, said in an interview that the senator looked to be committed to his work inside the Democratic Party. And even at the conference, an invitation-only affair for around 250 people, there was speculation that another candidate could pick up Sanders’s banner in 2020.

&gt; **Author Naomi Klein told a Friday audience that support for a “Green New Deal,” a jobs plan based on a transition away from fossil fuels, would be essential for “any candidate who wanted to run as a progressive in 2020,”** Sanders or otherwise. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who spoke at the conference Saturday, is actively exploring her own presidential bid. No Democrat seen as a potential nominee, said West, came with as much “baggage,” where the left was concerned, as Hillary Clinton had.

&gt; Sanders, 77, has frequently praised the ways Democrats adopted his “really radical ideas” — he uses the term sarcastically — during and after the 2016 election. It started with the drafting of a more left-wing platform and continued this year as a record number of House and Senate Democrats and Democratic candidates endorsed the main planks of the Sanders movement — Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage.

&gt; Several candidates who had lost races this year also made it to Burlington, saying they would come away thinking that the movement had been dealt a temporary defeat and was still reshaping the Democratic Party, while potentially allowing other candidates to compete in the same 2020 lane as Sanders.

&gt; “Some [potential presidential] candidates have reached out to me since the midterms,” said Randy Bryce, a union organizer who lost an expensive and closely watched House race in Wisconsin, running on a Sanders-style platform of universal Medicare and abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. **“They’re interested in the message. Once people are educated on what Medicare-for-all involves, it can be popular throughout the country.”**

&gt; But for many at the conference, the only clear way to pull that off was to nominate Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries with nearly 14 million votes and with high favorable ratings. In October, a Gallup poll put Sanders’s favorable rating at 53 percent; it has been above 50 percent ever since his primary bid gained steam three years ago. Polls that test Sanders against President Trump consistently show Sanders with a lead.

&gt; **“Since we need to take such bold steps forward, it might be that we need someone who’s been clear and consistent for 40 years,” said John Cusack, an actor and activist. **“I hope to God that he runs and wins. What makes me hopeful is that when I talk to millennials and younger people, they get it. They love Bernie. They want a future.”

&gt; The risk, said Sanders’s supporters, was bigger than one more lost election. A major theme of the weekend was that the international left had failed to organize as effectively as the nationalist right. Varoufakis’s remarks Friday ended with the launch of Progressive International, an effort to build ties and share strategies between left-wing activists and parties across the world. Sanders campaign veterans, separately, had already been training left-wing parties in Europe on the tactics used in the 2016 campaign.

&gt; **“After the [2008 economic] crisis, two kinds of people united internationally: bankers and fascists,” Varoufakis said in a short interview. “The only people who never bound together were progressives.”**

&gt; Sanders himself has argued that the “post-World War II global order,” which in many countries responded to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 by cutting back social services. This, he says, enabled the rise of candidates who appealed to fear of changes both economic and demographic, like Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and of right-wing governments in countries like Italy and Hungary. While Sanders’s flock was gathering, Bolsonaro was at the international Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires, meeting with Trump national security adviser John Bolton.

&gt; **Fernando Haddad, the left-wing politician who lost to Bolsonaro after courts barred popular former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from running, said in an interview that his country was “harvesting the consequences of the neoliberal project’s failure.”** At weekend panels, Sanders supporters argued that Democrats had created the opening for Trump by failing to crack down on industries, like health insurance and banking, that many voters saw as exploitative.

&gt; “Right now the racist, violent, homophobic, and sexist far right is organizing,” said Ada Colau, the left-wing mayor of Barcelona. “We need to amplify all the alternatives we are building out in the world.”

&gt; For Sanders die-hards, there was no longer any question that he would be the best possible candidate to reverse the gains of right-wing nationalists. RoseAnn DeMoro, who had turned National Nurses United into the biggest labor backer of Sanders’s 2016 bid, took every chance she could to urge the senator to run again. Asked if she had been contacted by other presidential hopefuls, DeMoro was incredulous.

When I saw TFA I didn't really care about Snoke, I saw him and was like ""oh, creepy dark side guy, probably an old sith or something"" and moved on. What made him interesting was his relationship with Kylo, how he leveraged the boy's angst and obviously conflicted feelings about his family legacy and turned him.

Snoke saying he was an Inquisitor or from some new group of dark side users wouldn't change that relationship with Kylo and would remove the at least kinda interesting mystery about him. I guess I'm fine with the short ""He found the first order in the unknown regions"" explanation because it leaves the Galaxy feeling larger while still making perfect sense.

This is a bit of an aside, but I feel the frustration that the movies don't make the political situation in the Galaxy 100% clear. It's just that it doesn't really matter because I care about the characters more than grand geopolitics, and the prequels tried to do both ended up bogging down the first two movies with bad exposition and leaving a lot characters kinda underwritten.

If that was the case, shouldn't the countries with the tightest gun control have the lowest homicide rates?

Cyprus probably have the strictest laws in Europe, UK is pretty strict and so is Russia.

Cyprus homicide rate 1.11 in 2016

UK homicide rate 1.20 in 2016

Russia homicide rate 10.82 in 2016

Meanwhile countries like Norway (0.51), Switzerland (0.54), Czech Republic (0.64) and Austria (0.66), are fairly low. Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Austria all have looser gun laws than the European average. (All numbers from 2016).

If you look within the UK itself then it's England and Wales (1.22), Scotland (1.18) and Northern Ireland (0.97), which is interesting since Northern Ireland is the region that still maintains some of the older, looser regulations in the UK - they still allow large caliber semiatuomatic handguns for example where England/Wales/Scotland has restricted that to .22lr only.

As others have said, find yourself a new player friendly guild that can offer up any in-game advice or items - equipment you may need as you enjoy the game your way. 
(If you're on PS4 EU I could send you an invite to a guild that would be perfect for just that) 

My advice is to not grind a spot for xp etc. Just do the story quests and side quests (as you would in Skyrim) so you can get used to your character and the skills your class has. 

There are three main role types available that can be achieved by any race on any class. 

So choose one that feels or looks the most enjoyable to you. 
For questing, you'll need a certain level of damage and survivability as there is a good level of solo content (The main story quests for example) where you might feel a bit of a struggle. But as you level, you get stronger. So if you do feel a little weak, go and find another quest, enjoy it, come back later and smash it! 

There is always a lot of talk about sets and their bonuses and build types. But until you hit CP160. They are pretty much useless unless you're making a certain build for under 50 battlegrounds or under 50 Cyrodill. 
Just use what you can find that helps our play style for now. And that helps you get more out of your character. (More health. More stamina. More magica etc)
The same with food buffs.

Take time to read through your skills, your items, your buffs etc.

Decon all your old gear as you upgrade to newer stuff. Decon is the fastest way to level your skill lines in crafting (aside food and alchemy) 

Sorry if this is a long read. Just trying to offer up as much info as possible that I wish I knew when I first started. 

Ultimately. Enjoy the game for what it is, and don't be afraid to ask for help. There are plenty of people around willing to help in zone chat. 
Just type 
/z followed by your message to ask in zone 
/g If they group with you

False,4now5now6now,1463969048.0,,,,,,t2_y4v2q,"BURLINGTON, Vt. — By now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has gotten used to supporters urging him to run for president in 2020; at rallies, at airports, on his weekday walks to the Capitol. At a Friday night gathering here, Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis went further: Only Bernie Sanders could save the world.

“Let me convey a message from all of us in Europe, for all those comrades of yours who are now struggling to reclaim our cities, our world, our world, our environment,” Varoufakis said. “We need Bernie Sanders to run for president.”

The senator from Vermont, who is actively discussing whether to mount another campaign, smiled and closed the session. But over three days at the Sanders Institute’s inaugural conference, the senator and his supporters described a democracy under attack by populist right-wing forces as compromise-hungry “neoliberals” lacked a vision to defend it — a dynamic they see as leading to President Trump’s win in 2016.

Even as Democrats won back the House of Representatives last month, some high-profile left-wing candidates fell short, a dynamic Sanders struggled with; he opened the weekend conference by saying the party could have done better. For the senator and his supporters, it was clear that Democrats had squandered power when they last held it, leading to a surge of right-wing nationalism. To avoid a repeat, the left needed to organize — preferably, many here believe, with Sanders in the White House.

“Neoliberal establishments are collapsing, not just here, but around the world,” said Cornel West, a crusading academic who endorsed Sanders in 2016 and backed the Green Party’s campaign when Sanders lost the primary. “The only thing presented [to people] that has some credibility is vicious, authoritarianism fascism. If we don’t have a left populism that’s credible, we’re running down a fascist road.”

West, who has encouraged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate, said in an interview that the senator looked to be committed to his work inside the Democratic Party. And even at the conference, an invitation-only affair for around 250 people, there was speculation that another candidate could pick up Sanders’s banner in 2020.

Author Naomi Klein told a Friday audience that support for a “Green New Deal,” a jobs plan based on a transition away from fossil fuels, would be essential for “any candidate who wanted to run as a progressive in 2020,” Sanders or otherwise. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who spoke at the conference Saturday, is actively exploring her own presidential bid. No Democrat seen as a potential nominee, said West, came with as much “baggage,” where the left was concerned, as Hillary Clinton had.

Sanders, 77, has frequently praised the ways Democrats adopted his “really radical ideas” — he uses the term sarcastically — during and after the 2016 election. It started with the drafting of a more left-wing platform and continued this year as a record number of House and Senate Democrats and Democratic candidates endorsed the main planks of the Sanders movement — Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage.

Several candidates who had lost races this year also made it to Burlington, saying they would come away thinking that the movement had been dealt a temporary defeat and was still reshaping the Democratic Party, while potentially allowing other candidates to compete in the same 2020 lane as Sanders.

“Some [potential presidential] candidates have reached out to me since the midterms,” said Randy Bryce, a union organizer who lost an expensive and closely watched House race in Wisconsin, running on a Sanders-style platform of universal Medicare and abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. “They’re interested in the message. Once people are educated on what Medicare-for-all involves, it can be popular throughout the country.”

[Take a look at the possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidates]

But for many at the conference, the only clear way to pull that off was to nominate Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries with nearly 14 million votes and with high favorable ratings. In October, a Gallup poll put Sanders’s favorable rating at 53 percent; it has been above 50 percent ever since his primary bid gained steam three years ago. Polls that test Sanders against President Trump consistently show Sanders with a lead, though at this point in the 2016 cycle, polling showed Trump badly trailing in a matchup with Clinton.

“Since we need to take such bold steps forward, it might be that we need someone who’s been clear and consistent for 40 years,” said John Cusack, an actor and activist. “I hope to God that he runs and wins. What makes me hopeful is that when I talk to millennials and younger people, they get it. They love Bernie. They want a future.”

The risk, said Sanders’s supporters, was bigger than one more lost election. A major theme of the weekend was that the international left had failed to organize as effectively as the nationalist right. Varoufakis’s remarks Friday ended with the launch of Progressive International, an effort to build ties and share strategies between left-wing activists and parties across the world. Sanders campaign veterans, separately, had already been training left-wing parties in Europe on the tactics used in the 2016 campaign.

“After the [2008 economic] crisis, two kinds of people united internationally: bankers and fascists,” Varoufakis said in a short interview. “The only people who never bound together were progressives.”

Sanders himself has argued that the “post-World War II global order,” which in many countries responded to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 by cutting back social services. This, he says, enabled the rise of candidates who appealed to fear of changes both economic and demographic, like Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and of right-wing governments in countries like Italy and Hungary. While Sanders’s flock was gathering, Bolsonaro was at the international Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires, meeting with Trump national security adviser John Bolton.

Fernando Haddad, the left-wing politician who lost to Bolsonaro after courts barred popular former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from running, said in an interview that his country was “harvesting the consequences of the neoliberal project’s failure.” At weekend panels, Sanders supporters argued that Democrats had created the opening for Trump by failing to crack down on industries, like health insurance and banking, that many voters saw as exploitative.

“Right now the racist, violent, homophobic, and sexist far right is organizing,” said Ada Colau, the left-wing mayor of Barcelona. “We need to amplify all the alternatives we are building out in the world.”

The weekend gathering was by far the Institute’s biggest project since its founding last year by Jane O’Meara Sanders, who is married to the senator, and came at an auspicious moment for Sanders’s own prospects. Two weeks earlier, federal investigators closed their investigation of a land deal that O’Meara Sanders made as president of a now-defunct college, a favorite subject of the senator’s political opponents, who had watched an FBI probe sink Clinton’s 2016 campaign.

For Sanders die-hards, there was no longer any question that he would be the best possible candidate to reverse the gains of right-wing nationalists. RoseAnn DeMoro, who had turned National Nurses United into the biggest labor backer of Sanders’s 2016 bid, took every chance she could to urge the senator to run again. Asked if she had been contacted by other presidential hopefuls, DeMoro was incredulous.

“There are no other candidates,” she said.

A fork is a pole weapon which was used in war in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries. Like many polearms, the military fork traces its lineage to an agricultural tool, in this case the pitchfork. 

Unlike a trident used for fishing, the military fork was rarely barbed and normally consisted only of two tines (prongs) which were straight compared to the original pitchfork. The pair of tines usually ran parallel or slightly flared.This weapon was relatively easy to use compared to a sword, which could take years to learn how to wield effectively.

It wouldn't surprise me if UAwire was set up specifically for propaganda purposes (though propaganda comes on a sliding scale - it's not an on/off property). What I objected to was how iceman312 presented his suspicions as *fact*, with no context, and then later, when pressed, was not able to back up such a strong claim.

Your heuristics for determining if a site is a propaganda outlet might be useful shortcuts, but they are dangerous to rely on. A webpage with valuable reporting could have a cheap design because it's made by a single person with few resources. Conversely, a propaganda page could look elegant and professional if somebody is willing to invest in the propaganda. There are similar problems with the social media heuristic: [Twitter likes and followers can be bought in the hundreds of thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html?module=inline). And few followers does not mean it's propaganda either. For example, the Independent Barents Observer, which as far as I know is a reliable, high-quality source of news about the European arctic, has only 4159 followers and 760 likes.

If I interpret your 3rd point correctly, then it sounds like you're saying that it's suspicious that it's a specialized news site covering mainly Ukraine and Russia. If so, then I disagree. People make news sites about things they care about and know about, and such specialized news sites can have higher quality than generic whole-world new sites that have to spread their resources thin. [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com) is an example of a relatively specialized (at least when I read it a few years back - looks like it might have branched out to cover a bit more than Russia/Ukraine over time) news site with much more thorough investigation than generalist news sites. In the case of UAwire, one could imagine that such a site could have been made by somebody living in Ukraine - I'm sure there are many people in Ukraine who are sufficiently interested in that situation to put in the effort to start a news site about it (though in that case I would have expected there to be an Ukrainian language version available too, which there doesn't appear to be).

Actually determining whether something is propaganda or not is a lot more work than looking at superficial features like those. One can look at a representative subset of articles and check their factuality and tone. These can give a good indication of the quality and bias of the source, but that isn't enough to show that it's propaganda. Propaganda differs from mere inaccurate, biased reporting by being purposefully inaccurate and/or biased.

Yes, that is the excuse they constantly trot out. 

However, studies have actually found that the way topics are framed is consistently biased towards right-wing neoliberal economics and political opinions.

&gt;Contrary to dominant ideas that the BBC is biased to the left, our findings suggest that its economic journalism discursively normalises neoliberal economics, not necessarily as desirable, but certainly as inevitable.

[Framing the cuts:  An analysis of the BBC’s discursive framing of the ConDem cuts agenda](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884913501835)


&gt;the author of the 2007 study, Alan Budd, found no ‘evidence of systemic (anti-business) bias’ but he did discover a neglect of news from the perspectives of investors and workers. Indeed, the author noted indifference to the coverage of labour issues:

&gt;Around  29  million  people  work  for  a  living  in  the  UK  and  spend  a  large proportion  of  their  waking  hours  in  the  workplace.  However,  little  of  this important part of UK life is reflected in the BBC’s business coverage The belief that the BBC is ‘anti-business’ or indeed, ‘left-wing’ in general, is often informed by naked opinion and prejudice. 

[Tunnel Vision: the tendency for BBC economic and business news to follow elite opinion and excludeother credible perspectives](http://futureoftv.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Gary-Merrill.pdf) (As pointed out by /u/Yvellkan, although this cites peer review literature, this is not a peer-reviewed source.)

&gt;Tories get more airtime than Labour

&gt;So what about the accusation that the BBC is pro-EU? Again the evidence points in the opposite direction. 

&gt;What about the accusation that the BBC is anti-business? Once again the evidence shows that the opposite is the case. 

&gt;The fact that the City financiers who had caused the crisis were given almost monopoly status to frame debate again demonstrates the prominence of pro-business perspectives.

&gt;So the evidence from the research is clear. The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world, not a left-wing, anti-business agenda.

Zaev was a drug dealer in Strumica for years but Gruevski the patriot is shady ? 

Zaev does not allow recount in elections but Gruevski the patriot is shady ? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Gruevski's crime was caring about the Macedonian people . They ( Soros , EU , liberal elites ) were just getting him out of the way &amp; putting Zaev in for 2 reasons . the first was so he could go to Greece begging and pleading and humiliating our country . The second was so that Zaev would sign the UN compact for Global Migration . After we have been fully humiliated for Greece , we will join the EU , they will give us money , and we will have to spend it all on letting refugees in ( like what they did to Slovenia ) .

[Case 76 - Silk Road - Part 1 of 3](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-76-silk-road-part-1/)  

The Silk Road was an ancient network of trade routes that started in China in the 2nd century B.C. Via a combination of roads, and sea routes, goods like silk, paper and spices were transported from the producers in Asia to markets in Europe. 

Eventually, it wasn’t just goods that were traded – there were also ideas, customs, religions and even diseases. 

The Silk Road expanded throughout different continents and civilizations for several centuries. It connected Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. A marketplace across the world. 

Two major expansions can be traced back to the Silk Road. One of these was the introduction of Buddhism into China. The second was the Black Death. 

Vermin accompanied some of the goods along the silk road – and upon the vermin were fleas. These fleas carried the bubonic plague—also known as the Black Death—and as the fleas entered Europe, so did the plague. It’s estimated that in the 14th century, between 100 and 125 million people died from the Black Death, reducing the world’s population by somewhere between 30 and 60%. 

The Silk Road is recognized as the very first true globalization that the world experienced. The free trade of goods and the passing of ideas and customs from one society to another. It changed everything.  

It would be many centuries later that a very different kind of marketplace would open up on a modern platform, a new trade route – using the same name. 

Silk Road.

Nob and the Dread Pirate Roberts started to communicate regularly. The Dread Pirate Roberts had no idea he was really speaking to a DEA agent. And the DEA agent had no idea about the true identity of the Dread Pirate Roberts. 

But it was a promising start.

[Case 76 - Silk Road -  Part 3 of 3](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-76-silk-road-part-3/)  

As the two agents walked towards the front door of 2260 Fifteenth Avenue, one of them pulled out the fake IDs to have another look before asking questions. 

When they reached the door, the same agent was about to knock when he saw a man standing on the other side of the door wearing nothing but shorts. It was the man whose picture was on the fake identity cards. 

Ross Ulbricht froze, the two men in suits staring at him from outside the front door could only mean one thing. 

He managed to compose himself and slowly opened the door.

&gt; The advantage of punishment is that it may cause sufficient harm to Putin to convince him not to undertake subsequent efforts. But the actual likelihood of these punishment activities succeeding is difficult to assess. It is impossible to know whether the Russian government would have undertaken additional activities against the United States without the existing punishment or whether greater punishment would have led  to greater Russian restraint. Some options for punishment include democracy promotion activities (described in more detail in a later section) or otherwise weakening Putin’s hold on power, echoing Soviet-era U.S. tactics of political warfare. One participant recommended a U.S. policy of putting “Russia back to where it belongs, a nation with minimal economic footprint and appropriate with its post–Cold War position. Russia is trying to hit above its weight right now.”

&gt; Punishment has several disadvantages and risks. First, as one participant noted, sanctions may not be effective because, from his perspective, the impact of sanctions is small, relative to other incentives shaping Russia’s decisions. By his account, the Ukraine sanctions, which have been in place for years, were a “blunt, ineffective tool,” and the “the prices have to be very high” to convince Russia to change its  policy. Another participant similarly observed that sanctions have affected the Russian economy, but not necessarily its policies.

&gt; Second, punishment requires attribution, which is currently quite difficult and time-intensive and likely to grow more difficult. Obfuscation techniques continually evolve and improve, and a nation-state with sufficient motivation and expertise, such as Russia, is likely to avidly pursue such technologies.

&gt; A third disadvantage of punishment is that it could lead Russia to escalate its activities against the United States. Accounts of Russian foreign policy highlight how Russia is motivated to undertake aggressive actions toward the West because of the perceived threat of Western actions. Any additional Western punishments, especially actions targeted toward weakening Putin’s hold on power, are likely to be taken as a direct threat to the regime and lead to escalation. Further, Russia may not distinguish between actions intended as a response to its specific activities on social media and actions intended as a larger Western intent to weaken or cause harm to Russian interests. One workshop participant suggested that the United States could make the link-age clear through informal communications. But many participants observed that the current lack of clear coordination among U.S. gov-ernment bodies could undermine the impact of deterrence by punishment. Mutual  distrust between Russia and the United States could similarly undermine the clarity of message associated with punishment.

&gt; A final disadvantage is that U.S. allies may not support punishing Russia, especially European countries who seek to maintain a positive relationship  with Russia and who may perceive U.S. actions against Russia as unnecessarily aggressive.",True,False,False,,0,1543708413,,1543720680,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eavyan6,True,t3_a27p5d,True,t3_a27p5d,/r/ActiveMeasures/comments/a27p5d/countering_russian_social_media_influence/eavyan6/,,1546297607,2,True,False,ActiveMeasures,t5_3jror,r/ActiveMeasures,public,[],text,False,

False,Panda-eats,1538476962.0,,,,,,t2_2bwgzvzq,"A few thoughts that may help identify why you are feeling uncomfortable with this film. 

1.	The categorisation of “asians”. It’s meant to be predominantly Singaporean Chinese, but the film features stars and characters from all over Asia. These countries don’t share a language or culture. All they shares is an “otherness” when perceived by western audiences. It’s like making a film called “crazy rich Europeans” and lumping Latvian, German, Italian, English and Russian millionaires together as though they are an homogenous group. 
2.	It plays to the western idea that Asia has a lot of idle wealth. While the former colonies inherited a landed gentry, it is not the typical Asian experience that one can contribute nothing to society and still live in luxury. 
3.	It relies on yellow faces and not story. I understand why this works well for the diaspora. They’re sick of movies where no one looks like them or has any related cultural values. Finally this film presents some Asian faces. The culture is homogenous Asian and nothing is quite right, but people will overlook it because it gives them a sense of representation and belonging. To a Chinese native, who speaks mandarin and has access to hundreds of high quality Chinese movies that speak to their aesthetic and culture, crazy rich Asians offers nothing. The flaws in representation become evident, rather than the accuracies. 
4.	it’s generally a pretty crappy film. It lacks any problem to solve. The closest thing to a problem is “my mother doesn’t like you”. This is character, not story. There are clear and immediate resolutions (e.g. tell your mother you’re marrying her anyway). These can’t be explored because there is nothing else to drive the story line. If this were called “crazy rich people” and had the typically mostly white cast, no one would watch it.

Overall, for the diaspora I think it’s great that films like this are getting made. Representation and visibility help with what is likely a difficult journey of finding an identity. For local Chinese, these films will probably remain slightly insulting or at least generally off putting for a long time.

Isso é que eu acho impressionando, e isso é que destoa do resto dos partidos políticos. Veja se tem gente defendendo o Pezão, por exemplo. Tirando o advogado dele, até agora não achei um.

The British Isles are an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and over six thousand smaller isles. They have a total area of about 315,159 km2 and a combined population of just under 70 million, and include two sovereign states, the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island of Ireland) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The islands of Alderney, Jersey, Guernsey and Sark, and their neighbouring smaller islands, are sometimes also taken to be part of the British Isles, even though, as islands off the coast of France, they do not form part of the archipelago.The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2.7 billion years old. During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass.

Korea's movable type was made in 1234. Bi Sheng invented it in 1040. 

King Sejeong, the man who invented the Korean alphabet, was born in 1397.  The Korean alphabet was nowhere nearly as widely used as today. As recent as the 1970s, Korean newspapers were filled with Hanja. In the 1930s, Hanja was everywhere. The Korean alphabet system was extremely new in the 15th century, not widely used like it was in Europe. The Korean alphabet also doesn't move simply from left to right. Each square ""character"" can have its consonant or vowel shift in position, making it more difficult to implement. 

Your very 1st sentence is already wrong in so many ways. 

&gt;Also you are completely ingnoring the press component of the printing press. AKA the part of the invention that was actually revolutionary. This is besides the point. I have never claimed that the Gutenberg press is inferior. You're attacking the straw man. 

Gutenberg's version is of course superior. It's an improvement, not an invention. It isn't surprising that nations that use the Latin Alphabet improved upon it. 

&gt;In fact if we really want to go back far enough, the Minoans of Crete had invented Movable Type in the 16th century BC

This is interesting. I've never heard of it. It seems like it's disputed though and definitely not done on a mass scale.

They hear how inexpensive they are, and how all these younger people stay in them.  How they can avoid paying a larger hotel rate and what not. In reality hostels are simply not for everyone. One hostel I stayed at was quite possibly the filthiest place I've ever been in my life, and I felt dirtier after take a shower there.

Typically genders are split up and rooms are filled with 4-8 bunks. So you aren't going to be sleeping in the same room as your girlfriend/boyfriend (unless you've done research and ensured they had private rooms). I've stayed in hostels that only had a single shower/bathroom yet had 18 bunks.  Rarely is there anywhere to securely lock belongings, and bunk areas aren't typically locked. You'll be potentially sharing the room with homeless people or drug addicts who've saved up enough money sleep there for the night. This makes ensuring security of your belongings even harder. Always keep your passport/money on your person, especially when you are sleeping.

Many hostels make you leave during the day so they can clean, and also so there is less chance that a guest stays back to steal everyone's stuff. Some even have curfews where you aren't allowed back in if you don't get back by a certain time. Many have set time where you have to be in bed with the lights out. Definitely all factors you need to research before booking any extended period of time. Being drugged and/or raped is also something you should be on guard for, regardless of your gender.

I'm against hostels in any way. They serve a really good purpose and allow people to have a cheap place to stay. I just know too many people who have never been to one that book a two week hostel stay because of how much money they are going to save on their trip. They get there not realizing all the things I mentioned above. If you want privacy, a secure place to store your luggage, and freedom to come and go as you please, I'd recommend avoiding hostels then.

I went outside to find a crowded street filled with people just walking around, the street floor was made of old stone and it went down a hill, houses on either side.

In the middle of the crowd was one of my old teachers, except he had glowing red eyes and I got the feeling he was looking for me, so I snuck around him through the crowd and managed to make my way into antiheroes house similar to the one I started in.

This second house had a cabinet at the back wall, which when pushed aside revealed a large crack in the wall. I went into the crack to find a crawl space sized tunnel, which lead to an underground cliff.

At the bottom of the cliff there was a giant arena with a stage at the end that had a pedestal on it. There was also banners with strange markings on them.

I followed the cliff edge to a bridge which lead to a large industrial metal door. When I opened it, I met a British bald man who lead me through the rest of the room. After a certain point in this factory-like place, we tripped an alarm. 

All the lights went out, then started glowing red as a loud blaring noise began. Me and the British guy hid in there concrete tubes, and right when we did that, a bunch of naked guys wearing goat skulls broke down the back door of the room. They had donkey jaw axes. They found the British guy, pulled him out of the tube, and proceeded to dismember him as I watched.

Then they found me, and I had a similar fate. But then I woke up, back in the first house.

I went outside the house to find the street again, but it was empty this time, and my teacher was still there, searching. His eyes emitted a spotlight that I had to sneak around to get down to the second house.

After I opened the door to the second house, I was confronted by a bunch of my classmates and I showed them the cracked wall behind the dresser.

We went through to get to the cliff again, and when we looked down we saw the arena. It was filled this time, with a bunch of men wearing brown robes and hoods. Really priest-like.

On the stage was a man wearing the same robes and hood except in red, in front of the pedestal, and there were two other men wearing white robes and hoods to each of his sides.

The banners were still there, and the man with red robes had the same mark that were on them.

He said something in an unknown language, and then a giant rumbling started as all the brown-robed men started climbing up the cliff side like spiders. 

They crawled on the walls and started running towards me and my classmates. When they got to us they started climbing on us and biting into our flesh, like straight out of a zombie movie. I watched as my friends being eaten alive and when they got to me, I shit you not, I felt every bite into my skin.

I woke up (for real this time) at like 3 am.

False,TheLastMgtow,1535862332.0,,,,,,t2_249bssbi,"&gt; There are different habitation models around the world. As a child, I remember visiting 'hill tribes' (in the tropics) where all the men lived in a 'long house' and I think the women and children lived in extended matriachial groups in separate houses.

Thats genius. Thanks for telling me that. Can you tell me the exact tribe it was?

&gt; In the mixed flats I learnt how much more sensitive to 'interrelationships' women could be. I was going to say 'offence' as it was more around perceived 'slights' but the reverse were also important to them. This preoccupation is the inverse of the equity thing (equal sharing of resources) that women also feel and which is all the current rage.

I didnt understand this sentence, because you are using lots of obscure words and vague. 'Slights'? So women want to share equally resources in that tribe? The current rage you mean in the west or in the tribe. Sorry i dont understand.

&gt;When we (wife and family) moved city, my wife was keen to get a second house or flat for herself (she likes peace and quiet) as the kids were growing up. I was fine with that as she is pretty messy (from my perspective) but I decided the mortgage was going to be too high (I was the one paying most of it off).

My academic background is very related to this. I concluded that the home must be divided into two spaces and then have a common space. Both spaces should be relatively independent. On the other hand two different houses, will just make it unfeasible for a family. And in the present day it is very hard, and im not accusing you of nothing. But distance today means cheating or at least lack of trust. Its the culture we were raised in. It becomes a open relationship, and open relationships are always a bad deal for the male (unless he is a cuck).

&gt;However, my wife has made much bigger and more changes to her life for the 'good of our family' than I have.

Nobody is saying women dont work for their families. Actually some of the most damaged women with some bad pasts are the ones who then try to compensate. What is always ignored is, what is in for us men? Nothing. Not only we are happy alone, we have nothing in it for us. Men use to have standards in the past. Right now, men are weak and soft, and so needy that hoe just needs to give them some affection, and they cuck. Sorry for my language. Her affections aren't enough, and no man in his right mind would accept a deal based on emotions and feelings, thats right only weak men would accept that. The romantic era is over, mgtow is ending it.

What im trying to say is that you as a man will always bring more into the family. Because you as a man, forming a family, and staying around is not a natural imperative of your biology. The fatherhood was always a sacrifice we did with our good hearted altruism for society and for the weak women we wanted to protect, if you dont understand this then i have to just assume you are on the same level as women, and thats ok. In the wild, men have sex and leave women to fend for themselves, and thats what i always felt like doing, but they always manipulate you to stay with them.

&gt;In many ways, while my opportunities have been constrained by family I would have been much less productive (for society) if I had only needed to support myself.

Thats because most men need a whip. They need something or else they have no motivation. Most men indeed are slaves. Look at how many men go to war for scraps. Do you think women would do that? Look at how good they feel dying for someone else. This is something that mgtow and single selfactualized men see as cheese or mediocre.

&gt;That 'man alone' feeling can be strong because I'm not a team player, as such, but I like contributing to / being part of something that is bigger than myself.

Alone is what 90% of people in the world are in this precise moment. Mgtows are not ""alone"". Mgtows have families and male friends. They only refuse relationships where men will actually feel even more alone and conditioned. As a male you need companionship from the pack of hunters not females...

&gt;I like to focus on applying my skills rather than being in with a bunch of others. I'm the cliched 'loner' which I imagine is kind of Mgtow.

Not at all loneliness is different than being alone. Being alone is good if you love yourself. This is what the bluepill men dont realize because they have been lowered down to a shadow of their former selves. They have been indoctrinated to feel incomplete, to work, buy, marry and have kids who will go through the same pattern. 

&gt;I'm with JBP on this. One man, one wife seems to be the most content society. 

For society im with you too. But for the individual it is not. See? You are starting to see why JBP is a collectivist. His argument is all about fixing society and the collective, while not giving a fuck about men. He forgets that responsability comes with authority, no authority then no responsability, those willing to take responsability without authority are cowards and sellout slaves.

I call things by the names. Im sorry...

&gt;Had to google this. So women desire men they perceive to be 'powerful'. Yep.

Hybristophilia is not about power, its about love of a violent man. This is the reason why 87% of women orgasm during rape. The average sex she has with her husband that she is bored with has no comparison with the free mgtow man she has sex with no strings attached, its much more exciting. You should look at what women did when France was occupied by the nazis. And what they are pushing now in Europe welcoming islamic migrants. Thats female nature for you.

&gt;This isn't so as I gather young women are having less sexual partners now.

They are just sharing the same sexual partners. They are having more. They evolved to share a few alpha males. Its men who try to cope by being cucks and still marry. Women are having more sex and earlier than ever. Its fine. Just dont ask me to marry them.

&gt;My daughters are certainly not sleeping around.

Sure. And you sure know that. And its sure not going to give them FOMO, and unleash a cock carousel at all. Even if they are not, because they wouldnt tell you that, they would be an exception.

&gt; Neither did my wife.

She would tell you everything, especially in the wedding day. /s.

&gt;Rollo Tomassi did a recent post where he mentioned that the more sexual partners a women has the less likely she is to 'commit' to a relationship with a given man. I suspect there is truth in this but I don't have the experience to say. 

Its absolutely true. But its not because she is more likely to commit or stay longer, its because she is less of a mess and has less baggage, so the guy stays longer with her and she doesnt screw around. Most virgins have FOMO now, because of all the media and etc... They grow up listening to music telling them to be sluts.

&gt; I have been acquainted with plenty of women in their 30's who have focused on their career (while not 'sleeping around') then found it hard to impossible to establish a reliable relationship. T

It is very easy for women to hide their sex experience and partners. Not so easy for men. Men must go and do. Women can be very discrete.

&gt;I've got 2 sons both living at home and without girlfriends so they are kind of Mgtow

If they are mgtow, they will stand on their feet and won't get cucked or enslaved. Things are not looking good, and the system is deperate for men to enslave. 

&gt;especially one of them as he is pursuing his studies and tells me 'girls are too distracting' 

Yeah. He is not a cuck. Congrats.

&gt;""Mgtow but he doesn't agree with the politics""

There is no politics in mgtow. We have no leaders and no objectives. We are not feminism we are men, we are not here to bargain.

&gt; My younger brother could be described as Mgtow as he's never married (succession of relationships), works a seasonal job and goes travelling the other 4 months. 

With all these mgtows. You wonder why women will get in trouble. They will be desperate to get a beta cuck to help them raise some other men kids. They are all having sex with the same men, and ridden with stds.

Good luck bro.

Why are you copy/pasting the same propoganda all through the thread?

Why cherry pick. What's your actual motive here and do you actually care about emissions or are you just being cynically jingoistic?

The EU has been making intentional moves away from the usage of fossil fuels for 35 years. The CO2 emmisions for the US and EU where pretty much equal and locked togather on, moved largley by broader global forces all the way up through to  the start of the 80's and have gone in the exact opposite direction of each other once the EU started to make willfull policy changes. Up v Down respectively. [Please, take a look at the numbers.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?end=2014&amp;locations=US-EU&amp;start=1960) It's undeniable.

In absolute numbers: The US today, emits a touch over 5 million KT of CO2 annually. That's up about ~25% on the early 80's. The EU emits a touch over 3 million KT. Down ~25% of the early 80's

It's worse when you realise the EU encompasses over half a billion people.

On a per capita basis the US emits 2.5 times that of the EU. They also hold the record for highest accumulated emission by a wide margin. They have an extremely long way to go.

As above, I strongly welcome the decreases the US has made of the last decade. This is greatly welcomed (even if it is from outsourced manufacturing).

My big fear is that positions like hers are toxic knee jerk reactions that want to use reductive logic and whittle down the debate to us vs the establishment and only tearing down the establishment works. And the argument I hear all the time is : well the current system doesnt work! I get it. But no one, not Bernie, Not her not anyone on their side has come up with a workable plan for medicare for all. Instead, they just say they will make it work some how.  How? How do you plan to do this? Do you think we can just switch our system for europe just like that by a law? Its not easy. It requires a lot of sacrifice on OUR part that many of US are not ready for.  

1No fault clauses- we are a sue happy nation.  A lot but not all of the european countries dont hold doctors liable.  A lot of patients want to see doctors for everything, insist on procedures and so forth.  Only one major study looked at the cost of liability (Gawande et al) and it was a poorly done study (that more or less admitted that they picked a number out of  a hat) and this gets cited everywhere. 

2. This type of care would not be possible in Europe.  People argue doctors make too much- yet their pay here is 80 billion out of 3 trillion.  Even changing that doesnt make a difference.  

3.And besides, europe in general pays very little for professionals.  Salaried engineers make half of what people in America do.  Same with lawyers, etc.  Doctors are still among the highest paid there but that wouldnt happen here. Why would a physician want to work? You might say -so what, I dont care they make too much.  Ok but again, why would they want to work? If a doctor here is given the chance to make 90-100k as they do in Europe why wouldnt they just move to Europe where there is a shortage as well? Why would anyone spend this time training?(I know I know tehre are some countries like Switzerland that pay better- but really - look at their cost of living and their population size and all the other factors that make them very very very different from us)

4. Some here claim that its young people who are in most touch. I am a young person. 32 years. but I worked very very hard in this country and she wants hard working professionals to pay more in taxes.  Tell me why a bartender with almost no real work experience that requires a lot of hard work should lead us? Why does she get to tell us what to do?  Im not saying the current generation is correct- but this knee jerk reaction to pick someone like her rubs many of us the wrong way.  

5. Outcomes are hotly contested.  A lot of papers and reports claim that healthcare is no better in the US but this is based only lies, more lies, and statistics that mislead.  They fail to consider whether poorer outcomes in the US are due to soy and corn subsidies that make us fat or whether its really due to poorer care in the clinics.  There are very few studies out there that do look at this and when they do they find that american healthout comes are superior.  5 year survival rate for prostate ca in the US is 95%. In UK its 55%.  Is this what we want? (look up on google  UPenn economic research healthoutcomes europe vs usa)

6. Did you know that in Europe countries simply say to drug makers that if they dont like the price they will null their patent and simply remake it and sell? Did you know that almost all drug research comes out of the US? On occasion I hear about novel therapies from elsewhere like Cuba but its not as common as I wish it were.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fixes: 

1. Medicare for All is not a workable solution until one is PRESENTED. Which it hasnt been. Right now its just a statement. 
2. To pay for healthcare, why do liberals want to tax professionals? Why do they insist on this but are willing to hobnob with the ultra wealthy? Why wont they instead propose a tax against billionares and stock? Why not tax stock sales at the same income rate as salaried? I know some argue that people will just transfer wealth but thats an argument for later- there are ways to deal with this- but NO ONE wants to.  Did cynthia nixon agree to part with her many millions now and give it away? Will she live in a small 1 br apartment? What happens to her royalties today? There are so many like her - who simply want to grasp for quick fixes but find nothing. 
3. How about fixing malpractice and tort? CYA related healthcare is a large part of medical practice. If suing doctors is  really not that expensive then why not at least fund further research to truly evaluate this instead of guessing? 

I wish the responses were not: 'pah conservative blowhard nonsense' but rather a substantive conversation. I never get it.  I wish a good dialog could actually take place.

Since, if there is a subconscious racist reaction people may tend to ignore the racist intents if there are less of the individuals they are racist against, perhaps they already feel empowered and know that their views will always push ahead of the smaller ""tribes"". If their tribe is able to do well first, then they can help the smaller percent? Whereas, in the United States there are sufficient enough ""outsiders"", ""mixed outsiders"", or individuals who seem to combat the subconscious racism by supporting the ""outsiders"" to create tension in ideas with these instinctive ""own tribe before others"" individuals.

Truth is different from fact. Truth can be valid even if it’s not factual, even if it’s not ethical, because truth is subjective and fact is not. And since those of us who are not experts in a given field use truth to explain facts, things can get weird really quickly without us even realizing. 

For example, it was accepted as truth for a long time that Napoleon was super short, and because of this, he tried to conquer Europe to compensate. (I’m for sure generalizing, apologies) Now, it’s accepted that he was probably only slightly below average height for the time. Whether or not either of these ideas are factual, the term “Napoleonic Complex” exists and persists regardless. The truth behind this particular bit of history can never be categorically confirmed, but nevertheless has birthed a concept that has persisted despite its dubious origins. Such is the power of subjective truth— in the right circumstances it can virtually create something out of nothing.

I do agree with you that this is a teaching point for our culture. But maybe we disagree on the lesson.

Show me one audit of M3 money [since 2006](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M3). I really want to know who is issued money or at least how much is issued in loans. I think progressives in Congress would also like to know. It's certainly not on any public website. Oh wait, [not all loans require collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_deposit&amp;oldid=853625446) fractional-reserve deposits from the bank. With fractional-reserve, central banks can issue nine times the money they receive (also a major problem in the EU). Without fractional-reserve, they can issue infinite money.

&gt; petroleum markets are not going to somehow remove the USD as an international reserve currency.

Yet US allies are forced to reject all other currencies when selling oil, which means the buyers need USD. The strength of the USD is pinned to oil. Countries need USD to buy oil or trade with the USA. Institutional investors (bankers) and hedge funds use trading bots to constantly do arbitrage between currencies on the stock markets and crypto market. They control the market, so if they don't like that the euro is gaining dominance they can easily dump the euro to bring it down 2% within days. For a few days in October the euro/usd exchange rate stayed at 1.337 with zero fluctuation, because 1337 is a meme-level and investors thought it would be funny. Heck, I make a living by scalping 1337, 420, 666, 777 and 1000.

&gt; Oil is big, but not bigger than everything else combined.

Even though I cannot comprehend the idea behind the new GT2 category, I do think Ratel is doing a great job in running his championships. After all, he is the person responsible for the resurrection of the GT racing in the 90s, and it's continued stability ever since.

[Early next year](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/10/25/inenglish/1540464607_998634.html). Ironically, the main reason why the trial could be delayed is need to properly [address all the appeals](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/tribunales/20181201/tc-huelga-turull-sanchez-falsoque-recursos-bloqueados/357465322_0.html)

&gt; That is, what the Spanish Constitutional Court does is admit all the appeals presented (something exceptional) and then not solve them. In this way, the Court blocks the possibility that they can go to the European Court of Human Rights. Because they know perfectly well that Strasbourg would not accept this in any way, and that it would condemn Spain and force the immediate release of the prisoners.

Your affirmation that the Constitutional Court is acting in bad faith does not have any solid basis. In fact, it can be simply explained as the result of the Constitutional Court being very careful about protecting the rights of the accused. According to [this article](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/tribunales/20181201/tc-huelga-turull-sanchez-falsoque-recursos-bloqueados/357465322_0.html), they are studying all the appeals, which lack precedent, are complex and include multiple claims not only about pre-trial prison, but also about not related aspects such as freedom of ideology and the right of representation. It seems secessionists would prefer the Constitutional Court to be sloppy and not protect the rights of the accused now, so they can score a political win in a few years when the case is taken to the ECHR.

All the while labour costs are rising and robotic solutions getting better and cheaper by the minute.
Also where is agriculture from that chart? Isn't that one of the biggest sector that's going to be hit by the epidemic the hardest?

Sure be sceptical, I am sceptical too. I do think the doomsday saying that happens here often doesn't help either and it's okay to look at other sides of the coin/perspectives.

UNHCR hat ewig lang gesagt, dass sie die lokalen Flüchtlingslager nicht mehr finanzieren können, weil die europäischen Staaten ihnen kein Geld mehr schicken - ich hab dazu eh grad einen anderen Kommentar geschrieben. Die Lage in den lokalen Flüchtlingslagern war halt total unter jeder Sau - du hast aber recht, dass es dort gut möglich _sicher_ war. Ich kenn aber auch viele Fälle von Menschen, die dort absolut nicht in Sicherheit waren, und so oder so das Gefühl hatten, weiter fliehen zu müssen - ob die jetzt aber wirklich weiter _nach Ö oder D_ fliehen hätten müssen, kann ich natürlich nicht beantworten. Ich vermute natürlich, das wäre nicht notwendig gewesen. Aber nehmen wir zB Afghanen: wenn ich schon mal nach Iran fliehen musste, und dann in noch ein Land, und dann in die Türkei - wie oft will ich nochmal fliehen bis ich eine Ruhe hab? Ich kann es persönlich nicht gutheißen, aber ich kann es ein Stück weit nachvollziehen, dass ich einfach nur _weit_ weg will, irgendwo hin, wo ich ""weiß"", dass eine Ruhe ist. Und gerade Afghanistan ist halt eines dieser Atommüllendlager der internationalen Politik auf das _alle_ scheißen, seit ewig.  
Ich finde es einfach so schwierig, weil wir halt einerseits nicht die Lösung für alle Probleme finden können, aber ich finde wir können auch nicht so tun, als hätten wir nirgendwo eine Verantwortung.

Sadly it is not just us suffering on the IP piece of this. Many European countries suffer this as much, if not more than us. Countries like Germany, world renown for their Engineering, suffer greatly. 

We as a country have the most “power” to do anything about it. Sadly, I still think it’s 10 years too late. 

We created this monster and didn’t deal with it early on. Our Bankers taught China how to fund their government, businesses and how global trade actually works. The greed of our own people created China out of a need for a more sustainable manufacturing base to support our economy and we didn’t put any guide-rails in place to prevent it from becoming a larger problem. 

Simply stated the Chinese education system is just now at the point from Elementary through University where they are producing qualified and capable Scientists, Engineers and A population capable of producing unique IP. It won’t be long until it will become a race to create it first instead of a “we made it now we must keep them from finding out how” espionage issue. More pathetic than anything is they have closer to the 1.7B people than the 1.3-1.4B people they claim to have on their census due to the single child rules, so we will never win the race to IP long term if we don’t properly invest in our education system now. Think about it, at those populations they have 5 people to our 1 working on each problem. 

This “trade war” isn’t over, it is just the first step in securing our sovereignty and long term capability to succeed and sustain. 

BTW- sorry for the ones that are actually naive enough to think any of that manufacturing shift is coming back here. It ain’t happening. Unions and otherwise inflated manufacturing costs will just drive any shifts from China to other countries. It takes too long and costs way too much to setup factories here in the US. Then you add the labor costs on......here we come Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, India and Taiwan. We need your cheap labor and factories backed by Chinese banks and business owners to keep our costs down and yes you read that right. Most of these businesses in these other countries are backed by Chinese banks or investors. I’ve seen it myself for many years sourcing materials for various businesses all over the world.

Only if they took the view that brexit was a steaming pile of shit in any and all possible circumstances.  If they believed that they had been instructed to carry out brexit or, at any rate, not making a good-faith effort to do so would hurt them electorally *and* they believed that a tolerable brexit were possible then, strategically, they're more likely to get what they consider to be a tolerable brexit as government than as opposition.

(Alternatively, it's conceivable that May actually was trying to lose the '17 GE, which means she both failed to lose it convincingly and failed to win the consolation of an increased majority.)

If they believed the former but not the latter, then I would expect them to prosecute a strategy that gave the appearance of a good-faith effort to reach a reasonable compromise but one which they hoped would fail to get through Parliament in which case they'd be able to blame Labour for defeating ""the best feasible offer available"".  It'd be the only way to avoid a spanking at the polls.  Well, a worse one than they'll already get.

&gt; Perhaps they were deluded enough that they thought they could handle it and only now has the shit hit the fan are they in full panic mode. December 11th can't come soon enough.

Alternatively, May might actually think that it's a reasonable compromise in view of the referendum result which provided no strong mandate either for leaving or remaining completely.

Hard-core remainers hate it because it's not remain, hard-core leavers hate it because it doesn't cut ties with the CU, but moderates of both sides might be willing to accept it as the least worst option — ""well, at least it's not no-deal/remain [as applicable]"".

I voted leave, but I consider the May-deal to be as reasonable a compromise as I could hope to get, so I support it.  I'd rather its imperfections than remain within the Commission's political grasp.  And crucially, it is the only alternative, short of remain, that doesn't fuck up Ireland.  It also goes a long way to protecting jobs; at least, many more jobs will be lost under a no-deal scenario.

I keep hearing from hard-core leavers that we would need the EU's permission to leave the CU, but last I looked I wasn't able to find out any explanation amongst the noise of exactly why or how that would be.  I hear a lot of complaints from same to the effect that it doesn't repatriate any sovereignty, but then neither would remaining a full member state (and would expose us to future cession of competences, something I think very likely if not inevitable).

I can understand why remainers don't like it, but I can't see any good reason for leavers to object to it unless they're actually happy with the idea of no-deal chaos and WTO terms.  I'm sceptical that there's a majority within leavers for WTO terms or no deal, but then it's only the noisy hard-core that seem to be objecting at the moment.

The rest of us are just hanging onto our hats and hoping that the moderate leavers don't let the extremists make the perfect the enemy of the good, and few speak up because (as my experience in this sub shows) few will admit to voting leave or otherwise engage because it's very difficult to have a reasonable, good-faith conversation with remain supporters (or, at least, the ones who're motivated to talk about it).",True,False,False,,0,1543753610,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eax18an,False,t3_a26jwd,True,t1_eawz21i,/r/ukpolitics/comments/a26jwd/close_colleagues_of_the_pm_say_that_on_current/eax18an/,,1546315828,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,[],text,False,

At the time the Russians were too weak at to derail NATOs eastwards movement. At the time none of the countries shared a border with Russia except the Baltics. 

Then NATO considered allowing Georgia and Ukraine to enter (though France and Germany were against because they feared it would antagonize Russia)

Russia’s deputy foreign minister at the time said as much “Georgia and Ukraines membership is a huge strategic mistake which would have most serious consequences for pan-European security”/ Putin remained that admitting the two to NATO would represent a direct threat to Russia. Putin hinted “very transparently” that if Ukraine was accepted into NATO, it would cease to exist. Russia’s invasion of Georgia in ’08 should have dispelled any remaining doubts about Putin’s determination to prevent the two from joining NATO. 

Further, the West funded pro-western individuals and organizations in Ukraine in order to try and export their values to the country such as democracy promotion and civil society strengthening

When Russian leaders look at Western social engineering in Ukraine they worry that their country might be next, and such fears are not groundless. “Ukraines choice to join Europe will accelerate the demise of the ideology of Russian imperialism that Putin represents. Russians, too, face a choice, and Putin may find himself on the losing side not just in the near abroad but within Russia itself.”

This triple package – NATO enlargement, EU expansion and democracy promotion – added fuel to a fire waiting to ignite. The spark came in 2013 when Yanukovych rejected a major economic deal with the EU and decided to accept the Russian counteroffer instead. That gave rise to antigovernment demonstration that escalated over the following three months. Yanukovych fled to Russia, new government was pro-Western and anti-Russian o the core. IT is clear that Washington backed this Coup. Shortly after, Putin incorporated Crimea into Russia – Easy because there were already thousands of Russian troops in Crimea and because the majority of inhabitants in Crimea are ethnic Russians, most of whom already wanted out of Ukraine.

Putin next put pressure on the new government in Kiev to discourage it from siding with the West against Russia, making clear that he would wreck Ukraine as a functioning states before he would allow it to become a Western stronghold. Provided advisers, arms and diplomatic support to Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and massing a large army ion the Ukrainian border. Also raised the price of gas that Russia sells to Ukraine.

Putin’s actions should be easy to comprehend. Ukraine is a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia. No Russian leader would tolerate a military alliance that was Moscow’s mortal enemy with moving into Ukraine, nor would they stand idly by while the West installs a government that was determined to integrate Ukraine into the West.

This is Geopolitics 101, you may not like it but you should understand the logic to it. Great powers are sensitive to potential threats.

 **Citations on the transition's dramatic reduction of suicide risk while improving mental health and quality of life, with trans people able to transition young and spared abuse and discrimination having mental health and suicide risk on par with the general public:**

* [**Bauer, et al., 2015**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.
* [**Moody, et al., 2013**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/): The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.
* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**
* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0). Trans kids who socially transition early and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health.
* [**Dr. Ryan Gorton**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”
* [**Murad, et al., 2010**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181): ""Significant decrease in suicidality post-treatment. The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ... A meta-analysis of 28 studies showed that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment.""
* [**De Cuypere, et al., 2006**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.
* [**UK study**](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

While Sauron (a Maiar like Gandalf) and Feanor ('most talented and fiery of all the elves') could be seen as 'Luciferian' figures:

* http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sauron
* http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Feanor

When the Elves first awake in Middle-earth, the Valar propose (via emmissaries) that they depart from their origin in the East and North of the world and come to Valinor in the Uttermost West (land of the 'gods') (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacsayhuam%C3%A1n ?). Eventually, Melkor stirs up trouble within 'Heaven' itself, steals Feanor's gems and escapes - and so Feanor leads a host of exiles back east to attempt a recovery, or die in the attempt (which he does)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Rebel_Angels_%28Bruegel%29

The writer I linked to in the OP (Anand, 'Men of Renown') makes the point that he believes(-ed) the 'bringing elves west' (into the 'garden' of the Undying Lands of the Valar, represents slavery (even sex-slavery)...

* https://stolenhistory.org/threads/foundlings-and-the-orphan-trains-video-by-conspiracy-r-us.641/

...and the character complex of 'Melkor'/'Sauron'/'Feanor' represent a righteous escape from tyranny (the exile from the Garden, as it were, in a new light) - and thus 'defamed' by Tolkien's work.

* The 'Wild Hunt' of Oromë *finds* the Elves, and he then runs off to tell the Valar in the west, which then convince a good portion of Elf-kind to 'go west, young man'...

Of Feanor:

&gt; Fëanor's skills began to blossom and other than a skilled smith, he was a **linguist** and a **Loremaster**. In 1250 he devised the **lettering system** of Tengwar, improving the work of Rúmil. He then turned his mind to the study of **gems**

 ""Russian behavior in Ukraine is clearly illegal under international law. In particular, the President must make clear that the annexation of Crimea is a crime, and that sanctions will continue until Russia modifies its stance and chooses to work with the international community to resolve the situation through the process determined by the Minsk Protocol in 2014. Allowing a frozen conflict, like Georgia and Moldovia (both essentially occupied by Russia), is untenable — Ukraine is too large, important and nationalistic to permit a long-term annexation of a further chunk of their state. The President must show zero daylight between the U.S. and our NATO and European allies on this issue, or Putin will exploit the seams to continue toward achieving his ultimate strategic goal of unraveling the trans-Atlantic alliance.""

If tourism and “shopping” slow, that has a direct impact on the tourism industry’s profits. It is natural and understandable that they ask for a quick resolution to this crisis.

Lower tourism profits equals lower government tax revenues on what is 10% of GDP and 11% of jobs in France. 

That means the government would need to raise revenues elsewhere or cut services further to remain on target for EU directives. Both outcomes are essentially neutral for the government, but are very bad outcomes for what the gilets jaunes claim to represent. 

That is why I think the tourism industry is being very careful on how they phrased their points. also, keep in mind Roland Héguy is the head of UMiH, and as such is a politician responsible for the welfare of his union members. He too is worried about the impact on jobs.

Further, I think the gilets jaunes are working against their stated goals in the medium and longer term by allowing violent protests. 

You are saying the government risks further protests if they raise taxes elsewhere. I agree with you. Nonetheless, it’s precisely the past 30 years of successive governments caving in to protestors which has put France in its current difficult spot. The “rich”are already taxed more in France than most other OECD countries, and there are structural budgetary deficits that are getting worse, primarily because of creeping increases in benefits, especially “avantages acquis” for civil servants (fonctionnaires”. 

Currently, fonctionnaires make more money than similar job levels in the private sector, have job security, and often benefits or retirement packages not available to the private sector.  

Given how large the public sector is in France and how wages in the private sector have already fallen, it’s fairly clear where the cuts need to come from.

On the other hand, Luka’s natural level of talent is just too immense. Basically all kids start early in a professional setting outside the US, yet you only see one Luka Doncic. He’s one of a kind. You can’t be this skilled and cerebral at such a young age only through training hard. European greats such as Petrovic, Dirk, Gasol, Kirilenko, and Ginobili were nowhere near this level when they were 19-20. Luka just has so many shades of talent. A superhero comp would the Legion. He just needs to learn how to put all things together and become better at the same time.

As for the Lakers, I’m not sure about their superteam. I think they can be one if Ingram becomes a top 10 player.

&amp;#x200B;

Lowered expectations are just kind of the nature of global soccer, so this doesn't bother me. There are the top global teams... Bayern and Barca and Liverpool... and then there is everyone else on a sliding scale of worse-ness. For this reason, most soccer fans have the club they support through thick-and-thin, but then they have their ""big teams"". Take fans whose local teams are in the lower levels of the English system. They likely still have an association with one of the top teams, to root for when their team isn't on. CPL will be like this. Halifax will be my team, but I recognize it is a lower level of global soccer. I'll continue to root for Liverpool in European competitions and TFC in MLS, but HFX will always be the team when competing against anyone else. I dunno. Being a fan of any team that is not a top global team requires lowered expectations, and I think most soccer fans know this. Might make recruitment difficult, but in terms of lowered fan expectations I think that's very much the nature of the game in most places.

&amp;#x200B;

Long-term players, sure, but again that's the nature of soccer. Hell, that's kind of what makes soccer fun - the international nature of transfers. I do believe that there will be consistency to CPL rosters. There absolutely WILL be guys who will play a large chunk of their career with the same team. They likely won't be the superstars. But superstars leave every team in soccer. Suarez left Liverpool. Neymar left Barca. Again, it's the nature of the game. CPL definitely will struggle to keep its top talent, particularly top talent that it developed. There will be players who stay for long stints though... guys like Drew Moor and Nat Borchers in the MLS. They aren't the stars of their team, but they are of a level of quality that fits well into a CPL squad. They fill in around your superstars, and I think you'll be surprised when a few of those types of players stick around longer term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Paying for a streaming service is par for the course. I used to spend $50 every year on MLS live. I'd happily pay something similar.   


So yeah, I mean, I don't think you're wrong necessarily but I also don't think any of the problems are that different than what fans of the vast majority of global soccer teams face. The fun part of the game is that you exist in an international arena with thousands of teams at various levels, as opposed to a closed league like the NHL where you only have to worry about 31 other teams. It means that your club is unlikely to EVER be ""the best"" and that's okay.

Edit: Pasting here for easier visibility:

 **Citations on the transition's dramatic reduction of suicide risk while improving mental health and quality of life, with trans people able to transition young and spared abuse and discrimination having mental health and suicide risk on par with the general public:**

* [**Bauer, et al., 2015**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.
* [**Moody, et al., 2013**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/): The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.
* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**
* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0). Trans kids who socially transition early and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health.
* [**Dr. Ryan Gorton**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”
* [**Murad, et al., 2010**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181): ""Significant decrease in suicidality post-treatment. The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ... A meta-analysis of 28 studies showed that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment.""
* [**De Cuypere, et al., 2006**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.
* [**UK study**](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3&amp;#37; thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

Crimea (and Sevastopol) belonged to Ukraine, but Russia rented a port there, basically. This was essential to the Russian navy as it's their only major warm water port in the west. As Ukraine began to move closer to the EU/NATO, Russia got worried that their access to the port would disappear, hence them moving troops in there. It helps Russia's cause that the population in Crimea is 65% Russian, so they're saying they're doing it to ""protect"" the locals. 

As for what happens now: Russia is basically pushing the envelope to see how much they can get away with. To be clear, those Ukrainian boats are legally allowed to move through that strait (maritime law dictates it would be illegal to prevent access as that would constitute a blockade). Russia seizing those boats is them tightening their grip on the region, as well as seeing how strong the backlash is.

In America, after the declaration of the Mason-Dixon Line, something like 65% of slaves were owned by the Virginia Royalty, this group being comprised of our early presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, etcetera). This was until Eli Whitney invented the Steel Plow and Cotton Gin, which caused a boom in the cotton industry in the early 19th century. The slave owners began to move their plantations to the Deep South for its richer soil and better climate, as well as how they could have a larger amount of land.

These plantation owners were all white due to the fact that it would not be for another 100 years that minorities could own land.

Also, the Jewish community did not even have a substantial population in the US until _after_ the Civil War, when slavery had already been outlawed.

As for Europe, while slavery was not as common there as it was in the States, the people who owned the most slaves were _white_, and the slaves weren’t in Europe, as you can see by looking at places like Haiti.

The place that _did_ have a big problem with slavery was the early Arab (not Jewish) world, where slavery had been integrated for years.

In conclusion, the Jews were not even in America in time to have slaves, and even if they were, they wouldn’t be allowed to since they were minorities, and in Europe, the Jews didn’t touch the slave trade with a ten-foot-pole.

Diesel is the favorite fuel of transport trucks. As in Brazil about a year ago, the truckers protested the high price of diesel, practically stopping the transportation of goods within Brazil. In France they may have been undergoing something similar. Compounded by other facts though. In France and in Europe in general with the Euro zone, you have truckers taking goods across countries.

Add to it the efforts to help fight climate change and reduce the dependency on others for fossil fuel. As a country you can add subsidies to help make change.

&amp;#x200B;

PSD2 is the primary reason I became involved with ChainLink and co-founded this subreddit. For context, I work in the Financial Services sector in the EMEA region, and I can tell you it is all about PSD2. In 2019, every European Financial Institution must provide API support for payment initiation and account enquiry made by the incoming onslaught of new Fintechs.

The banking landscape in Europe will change radically in a short period as Europeans begin to take advantage of the latest technology offered by Fintechs to meet their banking needs in today's world. Blockchain technology has come along at precisely the right time, and DLT has become almost as big of a buzz-word as Fintech itself. Also, in extraordinarily good timing comes ChainLink, a service that bridges the gap between Fintechs using DLT and Financial Institution APIs.

Behind the shiny new APIs lies the prize that SmartContract have evidently positioned themselves on - legacy payment systems that will accept nothing but the payment formats they were originally designed for. This format is likely to be the new (actually &gt;15 years old) ISO 20022 XML format. Any Fintechs wishing to make use of the new APIs can bet for sure that the Banks will not be converting formats on their behalf and instead will need to submit instructions in ISO 20022 format. Through their PoC with SWIFT, ChainLink has proven themselves as being capable of not just bridging the gap, but supporting the very formats that will run the post-PSD2 banking world.

There is a lot of speculation since the PoC about a partnership with SWIFT. For me, SWIFT has already given ChainLink something very valuable; a platform on the closed stage of the Financial Services Industry. SWIFT is seen in the sector as the keeper and enforcer of best practice for financial messaging standards so when Fintechs and Banks decide which Oracle services to use, ChainLink stands poised as a service made credible by SWIFT.

It's important to note that after the introduction of PSD2 APIs, Banks and Fintechs will not require SWIFT's telecommunications to communicate and therefore can work directly with ChainLink to connect to on-chain/off-chain data.

Often people suggest firms will just build their own oracles, but the reality is Banks will not be providing this service as, unsurprisingly, they aren't going to make the job any easier for 3rd party Fintechs. Meanwhile, Fintechs are often brand new companies who are not going to be spending their start-up funds re-writing Microsoft Outlook just because they can - they will simply engage with the industry standard oracle; ChainLink.

As you can tell, I am bullish about ChainLink. Often in crypto, the old saying about how the guy selling shovels in a gold rush is the one to get rich. Well, I believe PSD2 is another gold rush and ChainLink is the first in the door selling the shovels, the diggers, and the whole wash plant.",True,False,False,,0,1543766969,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaxf397,False,t3_a2edk9,False,t3_a2edk9,/r/LINKTrader/comments/a2edk9/what_is_iso_20022_and_how_is_it_realted_to/eaxf397/,,1546322296,19,True,False,LINKTrader,t5_3om2u,r/LINKTrader,public,[],text,False,

Consensus ne veut pas non plus dire majorité.

Oui j'ai bien compris que tu n'aimait pas Zucman, mais je note aussi que tu te garde bien de parler du second papier qui montre que les fonds d'origine scandinaves ne représentent guère plus de quelques pourcents de leur PIB, alors que c'est environ 15% pour les pays d'europe continentale, et 60% pour la Russie.

Pourtant la Russie n'a pas d'ISF, et un taux d'imposition très bas, alors que les pays Scandinaves ont un taux très élevé, et pour la plupart d'entre eux un équivalent de l'ISF. Ce simple fait suffit à démontrer que l'exil fiscal ne peut être entièrement imputé à l'ISF.

Ensuite on peut regarder [ce graphique](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pO_yr6TLJPUA2sNHtKmoaG4rez-tvcp139XaFEK968KDbPmNa1KZjtmXio40flBes5aynwfhV4N46Ra9idcZdPbr4VZsotbJMttcn5SIbVdPlrncXFwKQMcosR7cWBUJFMfIwtWD

Est-ce que certains contribuables s'exilent à cause de l'ISF ? Sans aucun doute.

Est-ce que tous les exilés fiscaux sont partis à cause de l'ISF ? Ce serait très étonnant, et plus ou moins impossible à démontrer.

Est-ce que supprimer l'ISF stoppera les départs ? J'imagine qu'on le saura bientôt, mais j'en doute.

Est-ce que la suppression de l'ISF a fait revenir revenir des contribuables et à contribué à l'économie française ? [Même des députés de la majorité en doute](https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/bonnell-l-argent-de-l-isf-a-t-il-vraiment-servi-a-l-economie-29-11-2018-2275225_20.php).

True, but it's improved a *lot* since even the late 90s. I'm not saying it's perfect or there aren't areas for improvement still, but it's gone from an F-grade to a B- or maybe C+. It's not *unimportant* to me, it's just not ranked #1 or #2 anymore.

Healthcare *can* be fixed, but the only scenario in which I think we end up with single-payer is with Democrats at a 60+ majority in the Senate and control of the House and presidency. In which case they'd be shitting on our 2A rights with AWBs, mag-cap restrictions, and unconstitutional red-flag laws. I don't think we end up with single-payer in any scenario where Democrats and Republicans have to work on a bipartisan agreement. 

So, realistically, we'd be paying for single-payer with our 2A rights, and that's too high a price to pay IMO. I'd take the current system and gun rights over single-payer with CA-style gun rights to be honest. If I wanted to live somewhere with restrictive gun rights and single-payer I'd move to Europe, but that's strictly not something I'm interested in doing.

Either way, it's apparent that this sub is pretty divided between ""liberal-first, guns secondary"" people and ""guns first, liberal secondary"" folk and I fall into the latter. I've been moving more and more conservative as liberals have been proving to be just as hysterical and uninformed on issues as they believe conservatives to be. They treat gun rights just like Republicans treat abortion rights, and I believe both to be of equal importance - right to equal self defense is an aspect of bodily autonomy just as reproductive rights are. 

That's why I won't just bow down and vote Democrat across the board just because Trump is an idiot. Doing that just gives us idiots of another ilk.

I think the most interesting things are that the movement is not purely national; with propagation to Belgium and ripple effects in other EU countries, and that it is completely outside of the trade union frameworks, and not quite respectful of laws etc..., which is quite exceptional in France, although more common for protest movements in anglo countries. But yeah, the lack of leadership or organisation seems to mean the movement is like a headless chicken, and there's a lack of clear demands. There's also a lack of internal control, which makes it potentially dangerous, and it's a testimony to the state of society in France imo, a lot of people feel they aren't represented and are angry, especially against all the bodies which they feel are meant to represent them (the state, the political parties, the media, the trade unions, etc).

It's clearly due to much more structural causes than just the last taxes on gas.

Como disse, o que os estudos mostram é que raramente uma linha terapêutica é melhor do que a outra, o que é muito mais importante é a competência do profissional abordando determinada linha terapêutica. 

Quando falamos da utilização de substâncias para auxiliar no processo terapêutico me parece algo muito mais interessante em termos de medir e quantificar os resultados e até potencializar a psicologia. 

Por exemplo, os resultados do MDMA para pacientes com transtorno de estresse pós traumático são muito promissores e muitos dos pacientes que passaram pelo estudo sequer são considerados como portando TEPT 14 meses depois da terapia assistida com MDMA. 

Citei o caso do MDMA por que quando você tem um substância acelerando o processo a quantificação da melhora do paciente é significativa e aí sim pode ser realmente vista como um modelo a ser explorado pela ciência. 

É muito difícil você mensurar o resultado por exemplo de uma terapia de longo prazo por que as variáveis são tantas que chegar a conclusão de que psicanálise reduz sintomas de X% ou a terapia Junguina reduz sintomas ansioso em y% se torna impossível.

By Dag Herbjørnsrud

‘I rise to challenge you, Yajnavalkya, with two questions, much as a fierce warrior … stringing his unstrung bow and taking two deadly arrows in his hand, would rise to challenge an enemy. Give me answers to them!’ With these daring words, Gargi Vachaknavi, a Vedic female sage, launched into philosophical debate with Yajnavalkya, the semi-legendary philosopher king and the greatest sage of his day. She repeatedly confronts him with existential questions about the fundamental ontology of the world: what is it that holds the Universe together? Yajnavalkya eventually proclaims it to be ‘the imperishable [and] on this very imperishable, Gargi, space is woven back and forth’. Vachaknavi is satisfied, and she declares to the other Brahmins: ‘You should consider yourself lucky if you escape from this man by merely paying him your respects. None of you will ever defeat him in a philosophical debate.

The story of Vachaknavi’s debate is from chapter three of the oldest of the Upanishads, the Bṛihadaraṇyaka, a diverse and complex Sanskrit text on metaphysics and ethics from about 700 BCE. Vachaknavi is one of the many ‘hidden figures’ of women in the history of philosophy in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America — what is often called the Global South. Philosophers today increasingly recognise the contributions that female philosophers have made to the history of European philosophy, such as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway in the 17th century. (Indeed, the new Oxford University Press series Oxford New Histories of Philosophy might revolutionise how we look upon the history of philosophy.) But beyond Europe, female philosophers in general continue to get short shrift, and their contributions go largely unrecognised.

Vachaknavi is not the only female thinker that helped to shape the world’s oldest philosophy. Already in chapter two of the Upanishad, it is a woman, Maitreyi, who launches a discussion on the importance of one’s self (atman) to gain ‘the knowledge of this whole world’. She begins by asking Yajnavalkya (often described as her husband, but better thought of as her philosophical companion) a basic existential question of human beings: ‘If I were to possess the entire world filled with wealth, would it make me immortal?’ When he denies this, Maitreyi asks rhetorically: ‘What is the point in getting something that will not make me immortal?’ With that, the first foundation stone for the investigation of the relationship of knowledge to materialism is laid.

And then there is Sulabha, an ascetic Yogic wanderer, who wins a lengthy philosophical debate against the philosopher king Janaka in the epic Mahabharata (4th century BCE-4th century CE). The king goes quiet after Sulabha sets the record straight: ‘My body is different from yours. But my soul is not different from your soul.’

Indian male philosophers relied on their female counterparts throughout the centuries. The most famous classical Indian philosopher is perhaps Adi Shankara (788–820 CE), who formed the monistic school of Advaita Vedanta, a vital part of Hinduism that bases its arguments on the Upanishads. In biographies of him, we read how Shankara engaged in a competitive philosophical debate with Mandana Mishra of the rival school of Mimamsa, which uses only the four early Vedas. The verdict of the debate came from Ubhaya Bharati, Mishra’s wife. She, perhaps surprisingly, judged Shankara to be the champion, which had the unusual consequence of compelling her husband to submit to Shankara’s philosophical school. But then Bharati addresses Shankara: ‘You cannot claim complete success over my husband until I, his better half, have been defeated by you. Though you are an embodiment of divinity, I have a desire to debate with you.’

Shankara obeys. They debated the Vedas and the different philosophical schools for 17 days. Bharati could not beat him, but then she struck on the idea of questioning him on the Kama Sutra, the science and art of love, knowing that Shankara had been a celibate from boyhood. Shankara accepted the challenge, but requested a month-long break to the discussion so that he could study these corporeal matters to perfection. He was successful, Bharati concludes, in the manner of Vachaknavi from the Upanishads:

&gt; You took all the trouble to master the science of sex just to conform to the ways of the world. That we have met with defeat at your hands is not a matter of shame for us, just like moon and stars do not go into disrepute when the sun suppresses their light.

After the debate, Ubhaya Bharati reportedly founded her own influential school of thought.

Akka Mahadevi (c1130–60 CE) is another significant female Indian thinker. She was born in the town of Udutadi, in Karnataka, southwest India, and belonged to the Virasaiva movement, which argued for female equality, and opposed all that divides humankind, be it caste, sex, language or dress. Her radical philosophy confronted all priests, and perhaps still provokes today: ‘All the Vedas, scriptures and sacred lore, canons and codes, are but grist and husk ground in the mill.’",True,False,False,,0,1543771743,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaxn4y1,True,t3_a2cm1e,False,t3_a2cm1e,/r/Feminism/comments/a2cm1e/before_the_canon_the_noneuropean_women_who/eaxn4y1/,,1546326082,6,False,False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,r/Feminism,public,[],text,False,

Except it won't. You can pass a law saying people need to go through a background check, and they'll ignore it. Just like they currently ignore the laws that say they can't knowingly sell to felons. 

You're advocating for passing a law that people will ignore in the exact same way they ignore the current law. The current law that is hardly enforced. So why would the new law be any more enforced?

No, it's a loaded question. Because you're phrasing a question that has two answers, and my real answer isn't one of the two options you have set up.

Criminals. Criminals who the ATF hardly ever goes after. Criminals who would ignore the universal background check system anyways.

We? You and I can't. Law enforcement can if they actually do their job.

There is a sign actually. The EU is trying to enforce their anti-gun laws and some anti-gunners within Switzerland is actually trying to do just that. The Swiss registration is also completely useless because it was forced upon Switzerland by the EU when they joined the Schengen Information System in 2008. Any gun purchases and transfers before 2008 aren't recorded.

False,sos_1,1465648857.0,,,,,,t2_ymulg,"&gt;When you compare the total population, yes. When you compare only white Americans (to white Europeans), it's almost identical

Why would you compare white americans to white Europeans? There are non-white people here in Europe too. That's some bizzare reasoning right there.

&gt;I can point to how crime and homicides declined following the expiration of the assaults weapons ban. Crime and homicides have declined since states started providing their citizens with the opportunity to conceal carry firearms. Unlike your unsubstantiated claim with no evidence, what I provided are **FACTS**.

So, did crime and homicide suddenly start going down after that, or were they going down anyway? Just because those things happened at the same time, doesn't mean there's any causal relationship.

&gt;How is that working with drugs?  
&gt;  
&gt;If anything, outlawing guns would make illegal guns cheaper (as it would increase competition in both supply and demand).

The war on drugs does make drugs more expensive. I don't think that makes the war on drugs effective or anything, but of course having to smuggle things in and out of a country makes them more expensive. As for making illegal guns cheaper, I doubt it. Having more guns in circulation makes it easier to steal guns.

&gt;Switzerland has much more lax gun laws that NY and California, and yet their homicide rate is much lower than both. So again, there is **no correlation** between legal gun access and crime. If you gave a real damn about violence in general, you'd be willing to evaluate all the reasons behind this disparity with other developed nations.

I understand that gun laws aren't the only factors in homicide rate, but Switzerland has much stricter gun laws in general than the US. In any case, guns are able to flow freely over US state borders, which makes state level gun control mostly ineffective. In Switzerland, permits are required to purchase and carry guns, and certain people are barred from buying guns. They also have a much lower gun ownership rate.

&gt;You're right, I don't have to. But I simply enjoy countering the mindless propaganda the left has indoctrinated you into spewing. Regardless of any fact I present, you'll still insist that gun confiscation is the only solution (even if ""common-sense gun control"" is the first step to that end).

Nobody has indoctrinated me into spewing anything. I'm not even sure whether gun confiscation would actually work. It might be the case that the supply of guns is just too high, and I don't think that it would be possible politically anyway. All I know is that if I had the opportunity to make gun laws in my own country more lax, I wouldn't do it. I think it would make it a more dangerous place to live.

Eli has even two solos, HonkMaki have one each, Nozomi has only the 'dancing center'. In the live staging it looks as if 'Eli'/Nanjo were taking away the solo from 'Nozo'/Kussun. And as we saw in this ep: Eli always ends up with the strings in her hand, due to her karmic destiny, as the Madoka phrasing goes...Honk kickstarted it, Maki needs to 'deliver' the music, and so those are the 3 pillars. 'Umi' maybe is a fourth one cause her name/the ocean is being staged way too prominently all the time. This happens often in manga and anime, and often in a unique way, right?"")

Never mind that it is not really an existential threat. Never mind that it’s economy is but a distant shadow compared to the US, EU, Japan, etc. 

The sin that Russia is guilty of is that they have done what they, and almost every other nation, have done: look out for themselves. 

That anyone was surprised in the least that Russia retained Crimea is shocking. Only a fool would have imagined that Russia would have allowed that critical strategic asset to go away. And I rarely use the word fool - this may be the first time in a decade and a half that I have used it. 

Russia is a bit of a loose cannon. So is Ukraine. They honor fascists and collaborators, they put themselves into debt with their neighbor and then cry foul. 

The best thing the West can do vis a vis Ukrainecand Russia is let them sort it out. Russia does not possess the manpower or other resources to mount a full scale invasion or occupation of any of its neighbors. Hell, the US has proven its inability to fully occupy and pacify even shitholes like Afghanistan. 

In the end, Russia is a sideshow and Ukraine is but a bit player. The main event, the headliner, is China. The Chinese have explicitly made it clear that they mean to supplant the US, the West in general and the world order we have built. 

China is the bogeyman. It is the existential threat. It is the one opponent who can actually threaten the world order.

Le peuple consommera toujours le produit le moins chère et le plus avantageux pour lui, c’est donc aux industriels de proposer des produits propres et pas chère au peuple.

Non. Le boulot d'un industriel c'est de vendre ses produits le plus cher possible pour maximiser ses marges. Il ne faut rien lui demander de plus. Et surtout pas d'avoir un rôle sociétal. C'est fini ça. Pour l'industrie, donner du travail au peuple est un moyen, pas une finalité. on pourrait même dire que certains voient les travailleurs comme un mal nécessaire : moins on en a, mieux c'est.

La politique sociale et environnementale ne peut qu'être définie et imposée par les gouvernants. Ce qu'ils font, bon an mal an. Même si c'est plus lent qu'on voudrait. C'est lent notamment en raison de la profondeur des changements à réaliser, du caractère mondialisé des échanges (nécessité de maintenir la compétitivité), de la nécessité de maintenir un niveau d'emploi et de prestations sociales, et de la complexité des processus de décision au niveau européen et mondial. 

Mais il y a du progrès. Les normes évoluent dans le bon sens en Europe malgré le lobbying des industriels. On rattrape des décennies d'inaction, petit à petit. Mais c'est tard. 

Le gros défi est à mon avis de maintenir un équilibre en évitant la pauvreté massive et en préservant le caractère social de notre pays.

How so? Not all of Argentina looked like Patagonia.

&gt;And European immigration (mainly from Italy, Spain, France and Germany) was proportionally more important than in the U.S.

&gt;There's nothing like that from Maine (then part of Massachussets) to Georgia.

Well it's a weird comparison, it would be like if the US 13 colonies stretched into the great plains, then you would have more native ancestry, also one of the original provinces contains 40% of the entire national population and is extremely white.

&gt;And that's why an enormous percentage of white Americans still can't differentiate between Spanish origin (southwestern European) and what they call ""Latino"" (people of mixed race, predominantly from Mexico and Central America/Caribbean).

They can't because the US is plagued by the one-drop rule and weird socio-political mentality of a dichotomy between ""people of color"" and ""white people"".

In any case I would need to look overall numbers of migrants for Argentina and the US, the US had more earlier migration while Argentina peaked later, in any case I'd say one would need to compare the interior more with Alaska and the inland Western states than compare the US East Coast with the original 13 provinces of Argentina.

As the most recent IPCC report made clear, [pricing carbon is not optional](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sr15/sr15_draft.pdf). The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in taxes](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own carbon tax (why would ~~China want to lose that money to the U.S.~~ the U.S. want to [lose that money to France](http://qz.com/837262/if-trump-pulls-out-of-the-paris-agreement-europe-could-institute-a-carbon-tax-on-us-imports/) when we could be collecting it ourselves?) 

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, or [$23 *trillion* by 2100](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-great-climate-depression). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is used to offset other (distortional) taxes or even just [returned as an equitable dividend](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)). 

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), as [the benefits of a carbon tax far outweigh the costs](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/02/22/u-s-climate-policy-look-like/) (and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y)). We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), and the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG).  
 
It's really just [not smart](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580) to not take this simple action.

[Contrary to popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) it's not actually the lack of public support that's the major barrier; in fact, a majority in [every congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&amp;type=value&amp;geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax, which [does actually help our chances of passing meaningful legislation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). But it won't be enough. We can't keep sitting around and hoping others will solve this problem for us. *We* need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:


1. [**Vote**](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge). Elections typically happen multiple times a year, and there are currently [**several million Americans** who rank climate change or the environment in their top two issues, *yet don't vote*](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf). Even if you don't like any of the candidates or live in a 'safe' district, [**whether or not you vote is a matter of public record**](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2018/planet-earth-gets-a-ground-game/), and [**it's fairly easy to figure out if you care about the environment or climate change**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U). Politicians [use this information to decide what's important](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x). If you don't vote, you and your values can safely be ignored.  

2. [**Lobby**](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/). [Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to do it](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) (though it does help to [have a bit of courage](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?referrer=playlist-how_leaders_inspire#t-170537) and [educate yourself on effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf)). If you're too busy to go through the [free training](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/new-member/#climateadvocatetraining), sign up for [text alerts](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) to join coordinated call-in days ([it works](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf)) or set yourself a monthly reminder to [write a letter to your elected officials](https://www.ted.com/talks/omar_ahmad_political_change_with_pen_and_paper?language=en).  

3. [**Recruit**](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/). Most people are [either alarmed or concerned about climate change](http://www.climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Six-Americas-2018-Mar.png), yet most aren't taking [the necessary steps](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) to solve the problem -- [the most common reason is that no one asked them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DoiQM_-is). [20% of Americans care deeply about climate change](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/public-support-climate-policy-remains-strong), and if all those people organized we would be 13x more powerful than the NRA. We're already [at 3%](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf), and [we need ≥3.5%](https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/8t6ma2/the_35_rule_of_successful_social_and_political/). According to [Yale data](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf), many of your friends and family would welcome the opportunity to get involved if you just asked. So please do.     

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) of the full report has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16304867), subsidies for fossil fuels, which include direct cash transfers, tax breaks, and free pollution rights, cost the world $5.3 trillion/yr; “While there may be more efficient instruments than environmental taxes for addressing some of the externalities, energy taxes remain the most effective and practical tool until such other instruments become widely available and implemented.” “Energy pricing reform is largely in countries’ own domestic interest and therefore is beneficial even in the absence of globally coordinated action.”
There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

In fact, it is by far the largest city in the north and if you choose to study here you will see that *at least* half of the students are in fact from the north or the east. 

However, I can imagine that internationally the university may be the thing that the city is most known for, but I really would not know about that.

Groningen *is* sometimes seen as a 'bubble' in the Netherlands though, this is mostly because it is relatively far away from the other large cities which are very close to each other (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, otherwise known as the 'Randstad'). 

I've also heard from international students in Groningen that they experience an 'international bubble', mostly because they live with other internationals and don't participate much in the quite typical Dutch student culture, which has tons and tons of all kinds of associations or societies. Becoming a member of one of those will definitely help in intregrating in Dutch (student) life, I have heard that countless times from members of my own student orchestra in Groningen. In fact, most people will come there just to get to know other people and make new friends. (As far as I know, this is true for every Dutch university city though.) 

Almost no university in the Netherlands comes with their own accomodations though, so in contrast to American campus life you're pretty much guaranteed to live in the city itself.

One more thing on an university 'making' a city, if you mean that the city pretty much wouldn't exist without the university, I don't think there is any city in the Netherlands, or the rest of Europe for that matter, for which that is true, simply because almost all cities are much older than the universities.

A Canada deal would require the same withdrawal agreement and backstop as May's deal or have NI carved off into the EU, so that's not an option.

Norway is a non starter because as far as I can tell there's no popular support for it, the vast majority would prefer either Remain or a hard Leave.

And with No Deal there must be something like a 350 vote margin against it in in parliament, with no government department at any level from Whitehall to local council willing or able to implement it, and no support for it in the business community (apart from hedge fund managers and Tim Martin of course). 

Unless someone comes up with a sensible plan to implement it and mitigate the damage I don't see how any government could allow it as an option. The current cabinet and Labour are dead set against it and seem willing to avoid it at all costs.

And I would hate to see a referendum campaign for Remain v No Deal. Both sides would dial the rhetoric up to 11.

&gt; Los líderes del G-20 en la cumbre en Buenos Aires. AFP-PHOTOUn temblor sacudió este viernes Buenos Aires justo en la apertura del G-20. Una metáfora perfecta de lo que está siendo la primera cumbre de países industrializados y emergentes en Suramérica: un cúmulo de improbables circunstancias e incidentes.[El décimo G-20 se celebra en un país rescatado por el FMI](https://www.elmundo.es/economia/empresas/2018/11/30/5c016eebfdddffa1068b46b2.html)y una semana después del bochornoso ataque al autobús de Boca Juniors en la final de Libertadores. **Con el presidente estadounidense cancelando en la víspera una cita con el ruso por la nueva crisis con Ucrania** y con todos en tensión porque este sábado puede frenarse o acelerarse[sin remedio la guerra comercial entre Washington y Pekín](https://www.elmundo.es/economia/empresas/2018/11/29/5c00161921efa0507f8b45d7.html). Ha fallado hasta la puntualidad alemana: Angela Merkel se perdió la primera sesión por una avería en su avión que la obligó a regresar el jueves a su país y salir al día siguiente desde Madrid.
&gt; 
&gt; **Buenos Aires no está acostumbrada ni a los terremotos ni a las dimensiones de un G-20**. La capital argentina está en una zona de sismicidad muy reducida, pero este viernes, cuando se abría el telón de la mayor cumbre de su historia, se produjo un sismo de 3,8 de intensidad a 32 kilómetros. El temblor sorprendió y asustó, aunque no se reportaron víctimas. En Costa Salguero, la sede del G-20 en el norte de la ciudad, los participantes de la reunión se enteraron por las alertas de noticias. **Donde sí se sintió con fuerza fue en los barrios del sur capitalino**, en el sur del conurbano bonaerense y en La Plata. Algunos ciudadanos compartieron su inquietud en las redes sociales: con la ciudad sitiada y los mensajes alarmantes de las últimas semanas, temían que se tratara de un ataque con explosivos.
&gt; 
&gt; El susto coincidió con la llegada a la cumbre de los mandatarios. La más esperada, la del príncipe heredero de Arabia Saudí, **Mohammed bin Salmán**. Fue el primero en llegar a Buenos Aires, el miércoles, y al que menos se le ha visto hasta la foto de familia con la que comenzó la cumbre. Estuvo dos días encerrado en su embajada. En principio iba a alojarse con su delegación en el hotel Four Seasons, pero la denuncia de Human Rights Watch (HRW) contra él lo cambió todo. Un fiscal federal argentino analiza ahora si cometió crímenes de guerra en Yemen, mientras el canciller **Jorge Faurie** defiende su inmunidad por su condición de enviado en una misión especial (el G-20) a territorio argentino. **El efusivo y dicharachero trato del saudí, señalado también por el asesinato de un periodista**, con el presidente ruso, **Vladimir Putin**, fue la imagen más comentada del día.
&gt; 
&gt; La bilateral que parece que no se verá en esta cumbre es la prevista entre Trump y Putin. **El mandatario estadounidense la descartó el jueves desde su avión presidencial** rumbo a Buenos Aires por su disgusto con la nueva agresión del Kremlin a Kiev. **Los 24 marineros ucranianos capturados el domingo siguen encarcelado**s y los tres navíos apresados continúan en Crimea. Recuperarlos es un punto innegociable para Ucrania.
&gt; 
&gt; [El plantón a Rusia, que había anunciado un encuentro para el sábado](https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2018/11/29/5c001cdd21efa0ca538b45f9.html), no es la única sorpresa que ha dado Trump desde que salió de Washington y hasta que, el sábado, canceló su rueda de prensa ""por respeto a la familia Bush"", tras [el fallecimiento del ex presidente de EEUU](https://www.elmundo.es/opinion/2018/12/01/5c02753ffdddff92bb8b456f.html). El viernes puso en aprietos al anfitrión de la cumbre, **Mauricio Macri**, en su visita a la Casa Rosada. No sólo tiró el auricular de la traducción al suelo, enfadado porque no entendía nada, sino que después su portavoz emitió un comunicado comprometido para el argentino. La nota afirma que los dos mandatarios expresaron en la bilateral su **""compromiso compartido de enfrentar los desafíos regionales como Venezuela y la actividad económica depredadora china""**. No es fácil ser anfitrión con dos huéspedes en plena guerra comercial y con la comunidad internacional enfrentada en dos bandos: el multilateralista y el proteccionista.
&gt; 
&gt; El multilateralismo está a la defensiva, también en esta cumbre, tratando de resistir a la ola proteccionista, nacional y populista que encabeza **Trump**. El presidente francés, **Emmanuel Macron**, trata de liderar la corriente opuesta, pero los vientos en contra son fuertes. El viernes, el presidente electo de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, vertió un jarro de agua fría sobre un eventual acuerdo de libre comercio entre **la Unión Europea (UE)** y el Mercosur, después de que el francés condicionara este pacto a los próximos pasos de Brasil. Sobre todo, a si el Brasil de **Bolsonaro** sigue los pasos de **Trump** y abandona el Acuerdo de París contra el cambio climático.
&gt; 
&gt; **El cambio climático es uno de los puntos conflictivos de la declaración conjunta** que debería aprobarse al término de la cumbre este sábado. Si **Macron** es el adalid de este tema, el presidente español, **Pedro Sánchez**, se presenta como el de la cuestión migratoria. El socialista y su equipo promueven que se apueste por una gestión integral de la inmigración, según explicaron fuentes de Moncloa. En el retiro privado de los mandatarios previo a la apertura oficial, **Sánchez** sumó fuerzas con los que defienden el multilateralismo, pero todos saben que no será fácil resistir. EEUU, Canadá y México firmaron un nuevo tratado de libre comercio mientras seguían peleando por los obstinados aranceles de **Trump**. Todo puede temblar en cualquier momento, Buenos Aires o la guerra comercial. La cena de esta noche entre **Trump y Xi Jinping** indicará los grados de ese sismo que sacude a todos.

False,talentless_hack1,1422156288.0,,,,,,t2_kxgwl,"It’s a reference to church law - canon is a Latinized Greek word that was used to mean ‘an official proclamation of the church.’ Back in the Middle Ages, and into the early modern period, the church was not simply a spiritual institution but was a civil government. It had its own courts, it’s own law enforcement in many areas. You could be punished - indeed burned at the stake - for violating church law. 

So canonical originally meant ‘part of the accumulated body of church law’ - just like a law code today or the body of precedent in common law jurisdictions. 

In modern use it has come to mean something like ‘part of the accumulated body of received right answers.’ For example, quantum mechanics, general relativity and evolution (in biology) can be seen as the ‘right’ answers. 

Disclaimer: The scientific understanding is not really limited in the way that old church canon was; that is, scientists would be perfectly willing to revise their models of quantum physics if they found enough evidence - but they understand the accumulated evidence suggests quantum mechanics is the best model. While they might scrutinize more carefully a study or hypothesis suggesting quantum mechanics is wrong - or indeed might mock as a quack or fraud whoever is going around casting doubt on quantum mechanics - if sufficient evidence and a plausible enough model existed scientists would likely abandons quantum physics in the same way they abandoned the idea of the aether.

So the term canon in modern use is something of cliched reference comparing the relatively benign to what was once deadly serious - the dictates of a theocratic police state that governed Europe for 1,000 years.

That's pretty rude, I have actual sources to my claims as well as many international institutions are trying to dispel the overpopulation myth especially the UN and the Gates Foundation.

we're producing more [food per capita](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Food_production_per_capita.svg) every year and also have [more production per hectare of land](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Wheat_yields_in_Least_Developed_Countries.svg). While at the same time using [fewer and fewer land to farm every year](http://crops.missouri.edu/audit/images/WheatAcresHarvested_MO.jpg).

First world countries have been making [Massive strides](http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/394541/emissions-based-to-ref-year.png) in lowering CO2 output

we found *so much* new oil reserves in the last decade that it could now last humanity at current consumption [300 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves) and this is just normal liquid oil without taking tar sands and fracking into account. Estimates guess that we probably have a few thousand years of oil left if you account for every type.

Meanwhile reforestation is so big that we now have more trees on the planet [Than we've had EVER in the history of mankind](https://phys.org/news/2018-08-global-forest-loss-years-offset.html)

**TL;DR:** We use fewer and fewer farmland every year despite our global population and food is becoming more and more plentiful while using fewer pesticides every year and doing less harm to the environment as well. The population will peak at around 10 billion in 2100 and reduce after that. We find and produce more resources *faster* than the population is growing while at the same time lowering CO2 output. And we are actually rebuilding the ecosystems and have a net reforestation which led to an environmental golden age in Europe and North America right now.

In what way do we have overpopulation?

I was never looking at GDP on a quarterly basis, I referenced average GDP growth.  And you can try to argue the reason for better metrics but the fact is that trumps economic growth is better than obamas according to [bea.gov](https://bea.gov) which is the only official source for growth and GDP.  You can try to change the premise but if you want to play that game I'm more than happy to do so.  According to the BEA Obama actually ranks last for worst economy amongst every president post-WW2.  Trying to claim it's because of what he inherited economically?  Weak.  Look at what Reagen inherited from carter.  Also, according to the Hudson Institute one need only consider the best year of growth to gauge the effect of a presidency and Obama's comes in at an abysmal 2.6 in 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll agree with you that the President doesn't have enormous control of growth but they can certainly nudge it in certain directions.  I disagree about unemployment though, it just so happens that a majority of the periods for record minority unemployment fell under trump?  You must put a lot of faith in luck.

&amp;#x200B;

And better foreign relations is not a metric, but I do think he has done a better job than Obama.  If you don't think he has, tell me why.  People are laughing?  Who cares?  Laugh at our backs as we're the strongest country with the largest economy in the entire world.  Why do I think this?  Trump has attempted to address NK, China, Syria, Russia, and trashed that garbage Iran deal where Obama decided to funnel a terror state billions of dollars in sanction relief in the hopes that the IAEA who has never once prevented nuclear development would somehow magically perform.  NK-  Not much done, but trying to do anything is literally more than Obama did.  China - everyone agreed chinas abusive trade policies needed to be addressed.  They also have mass internment camps for religious and political dissidents which is probably the actual closest example to Nazi germany in recent times so good luck defending china.  Syra-  Obama walked back his ""red line"" on Syria, allowed Bashar Al-Assad to gas his own people whereas Trump was more strict and even authorized military action.  And finally, Russia (probably the most contentious point in foreign relations related to trump) - Trump has consistently increased funding for European defense initiative which is a buffer against china/Russia, approved arms sales to Ukraine (Obama refused), allowed US forces to engage Russian in Syria, increased sanctions on Russia, and has expelled the most Russian diplomats since the cold war.  Let's not forget that Russia also annexed Crimea while Obama did nothing.  Disagreeing on the basis that Trump talks soft to Russia is weak, I'd rather have a president that talks soft and acts hard than is all talk like Obama.  If you disagree, I'm interested in hearing an intelligent rebuttal.

I'll answer the questions raised where possible but they are based on my own personal ethics and beliefs and as such I will probably not be able to see things the same way as you.

Being a vegan is very much a middle class choice, I've yet to see a breadline vegan struggling to eat. now this is obviously aimed at the first world vegans. Monitoring levels in the body isn't accessable to everyone.

For me if you have to suppliment a diet that's not balanced or complete, the fact your food has to be fortified for you to gain nutrients which we can both agree less effectively than meat just isn't right in my opinion, but if you want to live that lifestyle more power to you and congratulations, I can't remember it fully but I'm sure there is something about being of a certain decent (eastern European?) that means it's harder to absorb nutrients again genetics.

As for The video evidence you have seen may very well differ from what I have seen in total, I have seen a few vegan documentaries obviously they are heavily one sided and negative of the industry and that's fine it can't  be denied that it happenes, but i have also seen the flip side where slaughter has been handled correctly, hence why it's easy to cherry pick the best and worst, to this I'll add I'd like to see a video that's made by both animal activists and pro meat people that gives a more accurate portrayal of the entire industry from both sides, that way people would be able to make a choice on being a vegan or omnivore or vegetarian.

I will quickly as here: if people were told in order to eat meat you must first kill an animal yourself for consumption then there would certainly be a higher percentage of vegetarians and vegans in the world, no doubt about that at all.

As you say humane is tricky and asking for a humane way to kill a human you are trying to compare  it with killing an animal this isn't the same that's obviously ethics again, and a mental excersize often used by vegans to push their agenda and beliefs, again this is where we will differ. Why? Well...

If your vegan then your view is an animal is equal to mankind, it's the sentience/sapient debate circle, that's gets thrown out in debates.
what do you to hear from me here? Do I think chickens and cows are sapient, No, sentient probably yes.

Should we kill animals because they're sentient?
Yes in my view if it's quick and as stress free/humane as possible then great. Does this mean I would kill and eat a dog or cat? No that's not what my culture does, I'm not going to deny someone's who does tho. I can't agree with it but that's something I cannot change and I wouldn't want to either. I have no right to demand they stop doing that because I disagree with it.

Is bolting 100% perfect, no it can fail it's rare but I've seen it first hand. It's how the situation is handled during that defines how humane it is.

Now I feel the ending argument over the uncessesary part is actually more maluable in my opinion but I'll also add again that the definition is down to the person especially in regards to killing animals for food as my belief is we need meat and/or dairy for a healthy diet, and if vegan your opinion will not be.

Yes if you use an Xbox you need a controller but I will add you can actually use a mouse and keyboard such things exist now I have made that example convoluted. 

Do I want the meat I consume to go through unnecessary pain and suffering? No, that's my simplest answer I can give on the topic but like I said your definition will probably be different from mine.

 Quem cruzou, neste domingo (2), a rua Palestra Itália, em frente ao portão principal da sede do Palmeiras, pôde ver nos postes cartazes com críticas ao presidente eleito, Jair Bolsonaro.

 “Malandro é Bolsonaro. Todo ano é campeão”, dizia o anúncio ilustrado com fotos em que o político supostamente aparece com camisas de Grêmio, Flamengo, Santos, Botafogo, Fluminense e Sport.

 A imagem dele como flamenguista rendeu outro cartaz. “Bolsonaro oportunista”, dizia o panfleto, em que ele aparece sorridente com a camisa rubro-negra. O Flamengo foi o principal adversário do Palmeiras na disputa pelos dois últimos títulos brasileiros (2016 e 2018), o que aumentou a rivalidade entre paulistas e cariocas.

 O presidente eleito assistiu ao jogo Palmeiras e Vitória no Allianz Parque, estádio do Palmeiras, a convite da diretoria do clube, que garantiu por antecipação seu décimo título brasileiro.

 Cartaz com manifesto contra Bolsonaro em frente ao Palmeiras - Reprodução Já o vendedor ambulante Walter apostou que a soma da alegria dos palmeirenses com o time e a popularidade de um presidente eleito com mais de 57 milhões de votos rendesse boas vendas. Ele enquadrou fotos do Palmeiras e de Bolsonaro com a camisa do clube e outra com a faixa presidencial.

 “Custa R$ 15 o quadrinho. É baratinho. As do Bolsonaro eu não vendi muito não, mas a do time campeão está saindo bem”, disse.

 Apesar de Bolsonaro já ter posado para fotos com camisas de vários times, ele afirma que é palmeirense desde a infância. Quanto à preferência clubística de seu pai, Geraldo, não existem dúvidas. Ele batizou o filho com o nome do camisa 10 palmeirense da década de 50, Jair Rosa Pinto.

 Bolsonaro ficou no camarote do Palmeiras e chegou acompanhado do corintiano Major Olímpio, senador eleito por São Paulo. Ele assistiu ao jogo ao lado do presidente do clube, Maurício Galiotte, e acenou para alguns torcedores.

 Ambulante Walter vende quadros com fotos do presidente eleito Jair Bolsonaro e do time campeão do Palmeiras - Wálter Nunes /Folhapress Durante as eleições presidenciais, a Mancha Alvi Verde, uma das principais torcidas organizadas do Palmeiras, evitou indicar voto em qualquer candidato, mas se manifestou contrária ao então candidato bolsonarista Major Olímpio, autor de um projeto de lei que tramita na Câmara que prevê a extinção das torcidas organizadas.

 Não houve, porém, protestos contra os políticos. “O que estiver alheio à partida não nos diz respeito”, disse André Guerra, presidente do grupo, à coluna da Mônica Bergamo.

&amp;#x200B;

if you are from europe, i can recommend [forbiddenplanet.com](https://forbiddenplanet.com) i order all my comics from there.

if you are interested in this whole ""end of the world, start of secret wars"" business, you can start at infinity, a great stand alone story too.

its collected as a hardcover here:

[https://forbiddenplanet.com/122432-infinity/](https://forbiddenplanet.com/122432-infinity/)

&amp;#x200B;

im not really sure how you are supposed to buy ""the incursions"" part without Marvel Unlimited.

&amp;#x200B;

this then goes into ""time runs out"" and they are collected like this:

&amp;#x200B;

you can buy that as a hardcover too:

[https://forbiddenplanet.com/161794-avengers-time-runs-out-hardcover/](https://forbiddenplanet.com/161794-avengers-time-runs-out-hardcover/)

&amp;#x200B;

after this secret wars start, and its a fantasticly epic chaos filled explosion, one of my absolute favorite comic stories of all time.

[https://forbiddenplanet.com/157589-secret-wars-uk-edition/](https://forbiddenplanet.com/157589-secret-wars-uk-edition/)

&amp;#x200B;

whats also great about secret wars, is that there are an absolute ton of sidestories, or tie-ins that lets you dive deep into the secret wars world, beyound hickmans story, but you can read that when you are done with the other stuff :D

&amp;#x200B;

if you are not from europe, im sure midtown comics in the us, or amazon in the rest of the world, has you covered, but i do recommend hardcovers, alternatively, i think all the this is availible on marvel unlimited, and included in the monthly subscription, so if you enjoy reading comics digitally, you can always try that out with a free trial, maybe sample an issue or two before you buy the whole think physically.

Of course, but that cuts both ways. Russia can afford to fuck with some of their customers, but not all.

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: ""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."" And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

All definitions are ""human made ideas."" Pedophiles are actually sexually attracted to non-sexually-mature children. If gravity still exists even if everyone says it doesn't then pedophilia is no different. Lumping it in with non-pathological behaviour makes it harder for us to talk about the actual problem of pedophilia.

&gt; Some are 25 year olds manipulating 16-17 year olds for sex. The sex offenders list mostly consists of the latter. Most people still consider that a pedophile, which means the non scientific use of the world pedophile includes those people. 

Most people don't consider these people pedophiles, and if they do they're just wrong. Ever taken a look at a map of ages of consent? 16's legal in Canada, Australia, nearly all of Europe, and many US states. In most European countries the age of consent is *lower* than 16. America is a backwards, overly conservative country in this regard (and many others), and US sex offender lists are widely considered ridiculous.

It also denies that teenagers can have sexual agency. When I was in my early 20's a friend's sister came on to me very strongly over a period of several weeks. She was 15, which was, at the time, above the legal age of consent in Canada (it was raised from 14 to 16 about ten years ago, although there remains a close age exemption of 5 years). I didn't do anything with her for many reasons, some of which should be obvious, but it would have been legal, and nothing will ever convince me that it would have been anybody else's business, or that this would have made me somebody that children needed to be protected from. The fact is if you are smart about it, sex is not something of life-changing significance with consequences that are difficult to understand. And nobody (me, her, my friend, etc.) thought it was pedophilia. This is just mis-using the term.

Part of the problem surely stems from the fact that we call 6-year-olds children and we also call 16-year-olds children. Hell, I call 24-year-olds kids. But this is just showing the paucity of our vocabulary. 16 year olds are not children in the same way that 6 or 10 year olds are children. Attraction to 16 year olds isn't pedophilia. Only ignorant or uneducated people would say otherwise.

Well the thing is the Wehrmacht is a criminal organization the top  historians have declared it a criminal organization. they invaded  multiple neutral countries Denmark Norway  Luxembourg Belgium Holland.  they had voluntary Enlistment alongside the conscription. The German  public was aware Holocaust was happening from the start. the Wehrmacht   They  openly tried to help the SS kill the Jewish population.

​

​

The Israeli historian Omer Bartov, a leading expert on the Wehrmacht  wrote in 2003 that the Wehrmacht was a willing instrument of genocide,  and that it is untrue that the Wehrmacht was an apolitical, professional  fighting force that had only a few ""bad apples"". Bartov argues that far  from being the ""untarnished shield"", as successive German apologists  stated after the war, the Wehrmacht was a criminal organization.  Likewise, the British historian Richard J. Evans, a leading expert on  modern German history, wrote that the Wehrmacht was a genocidal  organization. \] Historian Ben Shepherd writes that ""There is now clear  agreement amongst historians that the German Wehrmacht ... identified  strongly with National Socialism and embroiled itself in the criminality  of the Third Reich."" British historian Ian Kershaw concludes that the  Wehrmacht's duty was to ensure that the people who met Hitler's  requirements of being part of the Aryan Herrenvolk (""Aryan master race"")  had living space. He wrote that:

​

The Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust. Its second  goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to  create a Lebensraum for Aryans. ... As Bartov (The Eastern Front;  Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern  front. Most of their three million men, from generals to ordinary  soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians. This  was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews),  sometimes generalised brutality and neglect. ... German soldiers'  letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the  Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race. Only a  minority of officers and men were Nazi members

 Com mais de dois bilhões de contas, o [Facebook](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/facebook) é uma ferramenta central para a informação e as relações sociais. As decisões de seus diretores já não são as piadas de dormitório de estudantes onde foi criado em 2004. Neste fim de ano, imperam duas sensações: não estão claras as consequências sociais da expansão brutal do Facebook, e a empresa parece mais interessada em relativizar seu impacto do que em ajudar a entendê-lo. [Mark Zuckerberg](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/mark_zuckerberg) admitiu, numa reunião interna, que a empresa estava “em guerra” após um péssimo ano, em que os casos da [Cambridge Analytica](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/caso_cambridge_analytica) e as [interferências russas](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/caso_trama_rusa) foram apenas a cara mais conhecida da crise da rede social.

 A percepção do Facebook mudou. Desde 2017, a rede enfrenta o caso do vazamento de dados e admitiu, em comunicados dubitativos, a atividade russa em sua rede. Em março de 2018, o Facebook foi acusado de ser uma [plataforma geradora de ódio em Myanmar](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/04/12/internacional/1523553344_423934.html), além de casos similares no Sri Lanka e na Nigéria. Também durante este ano, uma dúzia de executivos e funcionários importantes abandonaram a companhia. Seu valor na Bolsa cai desde julho – não pelos escândalos, mas por não cumprir as expectativas de crescimento.

 “A eleição de Donald Trump mudou tudo”, diz Harry Davies, ex-jornalista do *The Guardian*. Ele sabe por experiência própria. Em dezembro de 2015, quando ninguém ainda tinha ouvido falar de [algo chamado Cambridge Analytica, Davies revelou seus truques](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/03/20/internacional/1521574139_109464.html). Fora do entorno mais preocupado com a privacidade, porém, ninguém prestou atenção. Na percepção coletiva, o Facebook continuava “unindo o mundo”, como reza sua missão.

 Durante 2016 e 2017, mais de uma dúzia de artigos citavam a Cambridge Analytica como o “molho secreto” (segundo o *The New York Times*, por exemplo) da vitória de Trump. [Mas isso nunca deixou de ser um detalhe a mais da campanha](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/03/26/internacional/1522058765_703094.html). Em 17 de março de 2018, no entanto, veio a explosão: a jornalista Carole Cadwalladr apontou no mesmo *The Guardian*: [“50 milhões de perfis do Facebook coletados para a Cambridge Analytica numa enorme perda de dados”](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/09/28/tecnologia/1538153776_573711.html). A comoção foi mundial.

 O que havia mudado em dois anos para a explosão de algo publicado havia tanto tempo? “É complexo e tem muito a ver com a dinâmica dos meios de comunicação”, diz Paul-Olivier Dehaye, um dos ativistas que seguem a pista da Cambridge Analytica desde 2015. Dehaye prestou depoimento duas vezes no Parlamento britânico, a última delas na terça-feira passada. “Em março ocorreram três coisas. Primeiro, um vídeo gravado com câmera escondida [pelo *Channel 4*] mostrou que a Cambridge Analytica não era só uma agência digital; depois, [Chris Wylie despontou como denunciante](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/03/26/internacional/1522058765_703094.html); e, finalmente, o Facebook ameaçou jornalistas para evitar [a publicação do] artigo.”

 O documentário do *Channel 4* revelava que a SCL, matriz da Cambridge Analytica, havia trabalhado em países em desenvolvimento com armadilhas tétricas, como provocar adversários para que fossem flagrados em fotos comprometedoras. Wylie, por sua vez, era um canadense de cabelo rosa que havia deixado a Cambridge Analytica em 2014, mas que sofreu “remorsos” com a vitória de Trump e se sentiu obrigado a falar “por responsabilidade”. O caso tinha agora protagonistas claros: os da Cambridge Analytica eram muito maus, e o jovem com cabelo colorido era uma boa foto.

 “Essa busca desesperada de respostas para a vitória de Trump nutriu o considerável interesse na Cambridge Analytica e provavelmente inflou o significado da empresa”, afirma Davies. Ainda não havia respostas à pergunta-chave: como foi possível que Trump vencesse? “Dizer que quase 50% dos eleitores pensam parecido com Trump é inaceitável para muitos, em minha opinião. É mais reconfortante pensar que alguém enganou esses eleitores com estratégias ilegítimas”, diz Álgel Cuevas, pesquisador da Universidade Carlos III que há anos estuda o Facebook.

 ### Como surgiu a Cambridge Analytica

 Em 2014, um jovem estudante de psicologia de Cambridge, Alexander Kogan, criou um aplicativo para conhecer a personalidade das pessoas com supostos fins acadêmicos. Mais de 270.000 usuários baixaram o *app* no Facebook. Graças a uma autorização da rede agora eliminada, Kogan pôde levar consigo os dados dessas 270.000 pessoas e de todos os amigos delas. Com esses milhões de perfis, seu objetivo era definir tipos básicos de personalidade a partir dos *likes* do Facebook. Esses dados foram a base do trabalho da Cambridge Analytica.

 Para quê? Foi o que Wylie explicou no Parlamento. “Pode aparecer assim um perfil de pessoas mais dadas a conspirações, para as quais é possível prever a probabilidade de que sejam mais receptivas a anúncios com webs e *fake news*”, afirmou. Uma vez definidos quais *likes* ou interesses fazem com que um indivíduo seja mais propenso a ser, por exemplo, um neurótico, o Facebook permite direcionar publicidade a pessoas similares. Assim, um anunciante pode determinar 10.000 clientes segundo esses traços e pedir que o Facebook busque um milhão de pessoas parecidas. Um detalhe importante é que ninguém mais vê esses anúncios: eles existem só para um grupo de eleitores, e mais ninguém pode avaliar seu conteúdo.

 O trabalho da Cambridge Analytica acrescentava supostamente esse duvidoso fator emocional ao que milhares de empresas já fazem: identificar os perfis de seus clientes e mandar a eles a melhor publicidade possível. Afinal, a Cambridge Analytica mudou o destino da eleição de 2016 e do *Brexit*? É pouco provável. Os anúncios personalizados no Facebook mudaram o resultado? É mais provável, segundo estudos acadêmicos.

 ### O mérito russo

 Como se não bastasse, faltavam os russos. A [Rússia](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/rusia) realizou supostamente duas ações na campanha de 2016: primeiro, [*hackeou* os servidores do Partido Democrata e divulgou seu conteúdo](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/07/13/internacional/1531498048_703365.html); depois, fez uma consistente campanha de influência para fomentar a discórdia e a desinformação entre os eleitores. O Facebook foi uma ferramenta extraordinária para a segunda ação. De acordo com a rede social, 126 milhões de americanos viram informação publicada por agentes russos. Se por exemplo os russos tiveram acesso aos dados sobre *likes* – ou se Kogan lhes repassou os dele –, sua campanha de influência pôde ter tido uma base mais sólida. O Parlamento britânico diz possuir e-mails que explicam de que forma em 2013, a partir da Rússia, foram coletados dados pessoais do Facebook com um sistema similar ao usado pela Cambridge Analytica. Se isso for confirmado, seria uma notícia ainda pior para a rede social.

 O debate sobre a eleição de 2016 continua aberto, mas não é irreal pensar que o Facebook possa ter tido um papel. Dias depois das eleições, Zuckerberg disse que era uma “ideia bastante louca” [pensar que as *fake news* tivessem decidido a vitória de Trump](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/04/10/internacional/1523380980_341139.html). A precipitação de sua opinião não ajudou. Graças a uma investigação do *The New York Times,* soube-se que o interesse dentro da empresa em revelar a operação russa não foi implacável. A número dois, Sheryl Sandberg, tornou mais lento o processo de investigação interna e publicação dos resultados. O Facebook parecia mais interessado em dissimular do que em corrigir a plataforma. “Há maneiras de entender o impacto, mas isso exige o acesso a dados que só o Facebook tem”, afirma Dehaye. A rede não compartilha nada.

  Mark Zuckerberg antes de comparecer ao Senado. Leah Millis REUTERS Essa não foi a única má decisão política do Facebook. Nos últimos meses, a rede social contratou uma empresa de relações públicas, a Definers, para criticar competidores e ativistas com mensagens duvidosos. Dois nomes se destacaram: Apple e George Soros, o presidente da Open Society. A campanha contra Soros é especialmente sensível porque ele é um alvo habitual dos antissemitas. “Quando começam a surgir repreensões contra o Facebook, é óbvio que os grupos que o criticam estarão mais ativos”, diz Jordi Vaquer, diretor europeu da Open Society. “Alguns deles tiveram financiamento da Open Society, outros não. Mas a novidade é que o Facebook recorra à ferramenta dos autócratas: usar o argumento de que um bilionário lhes paga para causarem danos em vez de enfrentar o problema.”

 ### O algoritmo incompreensível

 O Facebook diz que é só uma plataforma onde os usuários criam conteúdo. Mas essa é uma de suas grandes mentiras. Zuckerberg não é comparável a um diretor de jornal, que encarrega, edita e ordena as informações. Mas tampouco é uma janela transparente. O Facebook decide o que vemos e a ordem do que vemos. São duas decisões enormes, tomadas na maioria das vezes por um algoritmo.

 Essa rede é uma agência de notícias pessoal sem transparência. Vistos de fora, é difícil compreender fatores como a eficácia de seus anúncios, a polarização das notícias falsas e seu uso para radicalizar. “Estamos começando a entender a influência dos algori",True,False,False,,0,1543803152,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaz2yef,True,t3_a2k0wg,True,t3_a2k0wg,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/a2k0wg/o_pior_ano_do_facebook/eaz2yef/,,1546350303,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,[],text,False,

* Video quality: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Potato - To come to this assessment google: (Name of dashcam) + Sample video. You want to review Day/Night/Shadow, look for flaws such as: Black Sun, Reflection White out, Dark Tunnel -&gt; Full day light Over exposure. WDR - ability to see into shadows.

* Build quality: Typically Made in China = Fair build quality (minor flaws/expect to update firmware) or Poor (do not buy.) Typically Made in Korea = Excellent build quality no or minor flaws. - Chinese make good dash cams, but 

* Parking mode: Yes/No, Excellent parking mode vs Lackluster Parking mode. Lackluster parking mode is fine, it just lacks one or more features of Excellent. Example: A119 v2, Automatic Engage/Disengage, Not buffered, Requires Hardwire kit with low voltage cut off feature. - Excellent parking mode: Automatic Engage/Disengage; Buffered - Able to record a few seconds before Motion sensor and/or G sensor activation, and after (Like a time machine); Low voltage cut off feature (Adjustable) Voltage/Timer based (either part of the dash cam it self or part of the recommended hardwire kit.)

* Wifi/cellphone app - Yes/No, and quality of.

* Cloud feature - Requires a mobile wifi hotspot ($50-100 USD) adds pretty cool features, Location tracking, Streaming, Upload/download to cloud, Cellphone text message notification(s) of G sensor activation(s) while in parking mode, Over speed notifications. Generally in the USA/Canada/Mexico it can be pretty expensive because of cellphone/LTE data networks, but people in the EU/Asia do this pretty often.

- Other features - Voice warnings of Micro SD card failure. Voice warnings of dash cam failures. Audio beeping noises of Micro SD card Failures. Audio beeping noises of dash cam failures.

In the dashcam world there are two very specific types of dash cams.

* Excellent video quality, Fair build quality, Lackluster parking mode dash cams: These are built for new dash cam buyers wants. Lackluster parking mode isn't bad, it just lacks one or more of the features of Excellent parking mode. Fair build quality, minor bugs/errors to be expected - keep up with firmware updates expected.

* Excellent build quality, Excellent parking mode, Good/Fair video quality dash cams: These are built for veteran dash cam buyers wants. Excellent build quality, few if any flaws/bugs, maintenance is largely optional, and more functional bells and whistles. Excellent parking mode: Automatic Engage/Disengage; Buffered - able to record a few seconds before and after G sensor and/or Motion sensor activation (like a time machine;) Built in (or Recommended hardwire kit) Low voltage cut off feature (Adjustable) Voltage/Time based. Good/Fair video quality is far from Excellent, you should check it. Good video quality does exist in this dash cam type. Excellent video quality does exist in this dash cam type (expensive though.)

Hi, and thank you for asking. Not many of our anglophone friends, colleagues, and neighbours know of our history, fights, and victories. There have been many cuts regarding the francophone community in Canada as of late, so how this will play out may very well affect how other provincial governments treat their Francophone minority. Since this was all done in the name of saving money, please keep in mind that the pulling out of cap-and-trade is going to cost Ontario taxpayers about 3 billion in penalties in order to return about 250$ annually into our pockets....

Yes, but it has grown into so much more than that. The Université de l'Ontario Français is to have 50% of its 82 million dollar cost funded  by the federal government, which means that Ontario will spend 0.1% of its post-secondary education funds on this particular university. (Negligible savings)

That said, DoFo has also cancelled a 2.9 million dollar grant to a francophone theatre troop in Ottawa. (Minor savings)

DoFo has also cancelled the printing of three francophone educational magazines, each with its own target age group, that are currently distributed to all French-language schools. The thing with this cut is that 100% of the funds come from the federal government with the understanding that the province can decide how to spend it. (This one is clearly an anti-franco move, IMO, as it saves zero dollars).

DoFo is closing the [Office of the French Language Commissionner of Ontario](https://csfontario.ca/en/) and transfering its responsibilities to the Ombudsman's Office. Why is this a big deal? Well, like the Commissionners for the Enviroment and Child Advocacy, **they are independent of government** and are proactive as well as reactive. It  All staff from the Office of the French Language Commissionner will be reallocated to the Ombudsman's Office whose budget is set by government and this can be a slippery slope. Futhermore, the Commissionner is calling for increased services to the Franco-Ontarian community.

You see, the Premier of Ontario has a constitutional duty to protect the Francophone community, a founding people of Canada. The first European to set foot in what is now Ontario was a French 17 year-old by the name of Étienne Brûlé. French and English are equal before the law as per the Constitution. Mike Harris' Conservatives tried to shut down l'hôpital Montfort in 1997 (which he lost after a 5 year court battle). The Supreme Court of Canada has previously ruled that a minority's rights and services cannot be cut or held back due to costs or projected savings, therefore the economic argument has already failed to stand in court.

Doug Ford has managed to rally Francophones from every corner of Canada and the Franco-Ontarian flag has been flown from the top of the Québec Legislature in a show of solidarity as well as from Montréal City Hall.

In both cases, they could have argued it was in a grey area where they couldn’t prove it was their fault, but in both cases they just said “sorry for your experience” and credited me before I even asked.

Some might think this is not very important, but there are plenty of carriers — almost all of them — whose support ranges from terrible to mediocre, and Fi used to stand out.

&gt; The bloc would comprise the Popular Party, which secured 26 seats, and the Ciudadanos party, which won 21.The Socialist leader in Andalusia, Susana D&amp;iacute;az, on Sunday night urged the right-leaning parties not to allow Spain to become the latest European country in which a far-right party takes a front-line role in politics.

&gt; Ahead of the expected coalition negotiations in Andalusia, neither the Popular Party nor Ciudadanos on Sunday ruled out joining forces with Vox to oust the Socialists.

 Santiago Abascal, líder do Vox, e o candidato Francisco Serrano comemoram os resultados. MARCELO DEL POZO REUTERS Um susto. Essa é a palavra que definiu as [eleições na Andaluzia](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/12/02/internacional/1543765846_278055.html). A região que representa o feudo histórico do socialismo espanhol entra pela primeira vez à extrema direita, só que entra pela porta da frente, ostensivamente, com 12 deputados na configuração do novo parlamento andaluz. Ninguém esperava. A ciência política errou nas suas previsões, de novo. Foi [Trump](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/donald_trump), foi o [Brexit](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/referendum_permanencia_reino_unido_ue), foi [Bolsonaro](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro), mas parece que ainda não queremos enxergar o tsunami político que representam os populismos de [extrema direita](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/extrema_derecha) no mundo. Os analistas espanhóis ficaram, como os brasileiros, de queixo caído e bocas abertas.

 Estamos diante de um fenômeno muito parecido com o novo nome. [Vox](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/vox_espana/a/), o partido espanhol criado em 2013 e que propõe dar voz aos espanhóis desencantados, transformando a indignação num capital político, atropelou qualquer cálculo eleitoral e pode ter na mão a chave para um governo de direita na Andaluzia, depois de 36 anos do [Partido Socialista Operário Espanhol (PSOE)](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/psoe_partido_socialista_obrero_espanol) no poder. Esta derrota da esquerda espanhola é daquelas que ficarão escritas nos livros de História, daquelas que inauguram novos ciclos. A Espanha enfrentará em 2019, provavelmente, eleições antecipadas diante dos problemas de governabilidade de [Pedro Sánchez](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/pedro_sanchez_perez_castejon). Se o Vox ganhou 12 deputados na terra do PSOE, imaginem quantos poderá ganhar em regiões da Espanha governadas pela direita. É como se Bolsonaro tivesse entrado na política brasileira pelo Nordeste.

 Venho estudando Bolsonaro há bastante tempo no Brasil e, recentemente, comecei a estudar também o grupo Vox na Espanha. As semelhanças na retórica são impressionantes. Ambos formam parte da estratégia de internacionalização da extrema direita apoiada por [Steve Bannon](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/stephen_kevin_bannon) e que pretende conquistar as urnas do mundo. Ambos se apresentam como antissistemas e *outsiders*, colocando uma suposta nova política como única forma de enfrentar a velha política, corrupta e fisiológica. Ambos nascem e se fortalecem na política da inimizade. Sem praticamente propostas programáticas nem conteúdos sólidos, a campanha de Vox foi da exaltação nacionalista. “Espanha grande de novo”, “Espanha primeiro”, “Deus abençoe a Espanha” são alguns dos lemas mais utilizados por eles frente aos inimigos que querem destruir o país: o separatismo catalão, a imigração, a União Europeia ou a globalização. Lembram-se do futuro [ministro de Relações Exteriores do Brasil](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/11/14/politica/1542224082_262753.html)? O Vox também é antiglobalista. É a retórica do cidadão de bem frente a um inimigo explorado até a exaustão. O cidadão de bem na Espanha é o “espanhol que acorda cedo”, o que acredita numa Espanha forte e unida, o homem religioso. Quando as propostas não existem, ó ódio se transforma em política.

 Pasmem, o Vox também acredita numa hegemonia e domínio cultural da esquerda e também utiliza a retórica anticomunista, só que desta vez a vítima do delírio coletivo em vez de ser o PT é o partido de [Pablo Iglesias](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/pablo_iglesias_turrion), Podemos, o partido do “comunismo chavista”. Aparentemente, para o Vox, o muro de Berlim tampouco caiu e a Espanha enfrenta o perigo de que o Podemos transforme o país numa [Venezuela](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/venezuela). O perigo vermelho pelo visto atravessa o Atlântico. Pasmem outra vez, Francisco Serrano, líder do VOX na Andaluzia, é juiz, um juiz preocupado com a corrupção, obviamente. O homólogo de [Sergio Moro](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/sergio_fernando_moro) na Espanha também diz que ele não é político, ele só quer servir a Espanha. Deve estar na moda os juízes não políticos na política.

 Serrano também é fervorosamente [antifeminista](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/01/12/cultura/1515761428_968192.html) e se diz vítima do “jihadismo de gênero”. O Vox é a favor da família tradicional, contra a descriminalização do aborto e contra os “abusos” da legislação espanhola que protege às mulheres da [violência de gênero](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/violencia_genero). Luz Belinda, também eleita deputada estadual pela Andaluzia é uma ex-militar. Eugenio Moltô, outro dos novos deputados, coloca em questão que o [franquismo](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/franquismo) foi uma ditadura. Mais dois eleitos: Benito Morrillo é ex-policial e Manuel Gavira diz que “o homem é criminalizado por ser homem”. Semelhança assustadora com o bolsonarismo, não é?

 Como Trump e Bolsonaro, os partidários do Vox são agressivos contra a grande imprensa e utilizam um tom polêmico e escandaloso nas suas declarações. Fazem da controvérsia um instrumento político muito eficaz. Contra a tirania do politicamente correto, dizem.

 Assim como no Brasil, não podemos dizer que todos os eleitores do Vox são fascistas. Tem gente, sim, que compartilha os ideais de intolerância, [xenofobia](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/xenofobia) e ódio e vota porque se sente contemplada por eles, mas a maioria é parte daquele Brasil e daquela Espanha cansados da política, raivosos e ressentidos. Aquele Brasil e aquela Espanha que não se sentem mais representados pelas forças da democracia. A extrema direita é uma esperança para eles. Aprendamos rápido porque eles estão ganhando tudo.

A few countries (such as Canada) have ""tripwire"" forces embedded in country to deter a full-out Russian invasion, the idea being that an invasion that targeted or resulted in collateral damage of NATO troops would provoke an Article 5 response. Though this doesn't seem like the strongest of NATO support for Ukraine, i would say it does enough to make a Russian invasion a la Georgia perhaps too risky for Russia to seriously consider. In addition, though it has seen improvements over the past decade, the Russian military would still face a considerable challenge from even a combined EU force, let alone one backed by the US if Article 5 was enacted. 

This is speculation, but to me I think a more likely path for Russia would be to continue its disinformation campaign to influence the next Ukrainian election with the goal of ushering in a new Ukrainian government more sympathetic to Russian interests. This approach seems to be more in sync with the way Russia has been operating lately, would be far less risky and would result in a more realistic/globally palatable result: an independent Ukraine (key for avoiding Western intervention) that either returned to the Russian sphere of influence, or at least remained non-aligned, thus posing little threat to Russia's perceived sense of security.

Some potential flaws I can think of with the above would have to do with Putin's seemingly more common ""spur of the moment"" decision making taking advantage of momentary opportunities, and the culture of the Russian military leadership being somewhat unpredictable/unwilling to take ownership of mistakes (such as the Kursk incident). This type of thinking is a direct legacy of the Soviet era, and one Putin had to deal with often throughout his leadership.

1. The Dark Empire Trilogy: a comic series that is very fun but kind of out there. I recommend people read it even though I don’t keep it as part of my personal canon.

2. The Thrawn Duology: a continuation from the Thrawn Trilogy, set a good while after. You might miss a few references to things that happened in between, but most of it makes sense having read the main trilogy.

3. The Jedi Academy Trilogy: I’d class these as controversial, because what they involve is very important (Luke founding a new generation of Jedi), but they are very schlocky and not really up to par with authors like Zahn’s writing skill. These are set in between the Thrawn Trilogy and Duology.

4. The X-Wing novels: set between ROTJ and the Thrawn Trilogy, these are very fun stories that help show the Rebels taking territory from the Empire and starting to form the New Republic. They also have some great starfighter action.

A lot of Brexit hype hinged around the fact that we would have an extra £350m a week or something to go towards the NHS. Obviously the day after brexit was voted on, one of the leaders of the anti-EU corp went on national television and said that that was basically a lie. Finally it turns out there won’t be any ‘extra’ money at all and somehow the people who voted for that reasoned that it was never about the money after all but it was about ‘sovereignty’ and controlling our borders more firmly. 

The irony of which is that firmer border migration  would prevent people we rely on to be affordable and educated nurses and doctors from the Philippines and South Asia from coming to the UK.

My undergrad is history and I really enjoyed studying WWII even before that, so I spent a lot of time watching documentaries and footage, and reading various primary sources for the period. 

Plane sounds come up often for various reasons. The first and most important for the average soldier is recognizing them. When you're in the field and hear a plane diving, it's helpful to know whether it's a friendly plane diving or an enemy plane, and to act accordingly.

In addition, audio itself is a psychologically important aspect of any war. When you talk to veterans or civilians alive during the period, the most vivid memories are often of sounds. This is especially the case for civilians of invaded countries, who often vividly remember the sound of bombers flying overhead or dogfights occcurring nearby. 

A more direct example for the war would be the German JU-87 'Stuka' I mentioned in another comment, which had special 'Jericho Trumpets' attached to it to distort audio. When the aircraft would go into a dive to drop bombs or strafe a target, the wind would pass through these cones and result in a sound that sounded like a long, horrible human wail. I don't have the link on hand but if you search ""stuka noise"" on youtube you can find plenty of examples. This sound would instill fear into many of the troops that were on the recieving end and make the plane iconic to this day for that very reason. 

This contributed to the psychology of the overall German tactic of the blitzkrieg, which focused on swift and crushing victories. Not only was this good militarily, but the psychological image of the ""unstoppable nazi war machine"" would spread quickly around the world as it swept over Europe. When this brutal army was sending planes at you that sounded like human screams, it was terrifying to say the least, and affected the morale, mental health, and combat effectiveness of many Allies armies, particularly the Russians as the Stuka saw heavy use in the Eastern Front (RIP Stroheim).

False,SaeleeSuperphan,1436834426.0,,,,,,t2_os1xw,"I think Vancouver is okay, but boring. I’ve met 3 fob white girls that had a very strong preference for East Asian men. I really feel the culture is changing. 1 was in her 40s and I met online. The other two I met in real life, one at work, and the other at the gym. Two of them from Vancouver, moved from Eastern Europe. The other I met in East Asia but she was also Eastern European. 

Two other girls that I would consider less attractive also seem to have a strong preference for Asian guys. All in Vancouver. I know one of them for sure moved to Vancouver when she was in her early teens. 

Edit: oh shit there was actually another one. She was 19 year old bbw (maybe a smaller one? Haha), but she’s was also not originally from Vancouver. This one was so into Asians. She ended being with a Filipino guy actually. 

I put myself out there online and once in a while approach girls in public. I think it’s not bad. It’s certainly easier in Asia, but it’s not that bad. You can’t be super picky though I guess. I wouldn’t say I’ve been with anyone above an 8.5 (in Vancouver) in a few years. 

It’s tiring. I’m in a committed relationship now and I’m thankful to be out of the dating scene. I think Filipino guys do pretty well here and we do have a fairly large Filipino community as well. Vancouver is just really boring on the plus side we having great weed and salmon. Maybe you have a really nice muscular defined bodied but if you don’t,  If you can get down to 165-160 you’ll probably increase your chances even more. I think Vancouver is a pretty good mix. AMWF, WMAf, AA, WW etc etc 

I really think there is a market for Asian guys out there. Many of the girls I’ve met that say they’re into Asian guys say that it’s just that Asian guys aren’t into them or don’t approach them. By putting myself out there (online) I’ve had girls contact me. This has worked in some capacity in Seattle, LA, New York and Florida. Once again they are between borderline fuckable and okay yeah pretty cool pretty chill. I wouldn’t date them but I’d fuck them. Well that’s not totally true, if I got to know them better maybe I would date them. For myself about a 7-8 looks wise is enough and then the personality can bring it up to a 9-10. Bad personality can take it down a few points two even for 9-10s. Not that I’d say I fucked many 10s or even 9s. Probably less than a handful depending on who you ask.

 If it’s just sex, I’ve been in the casual hook up, threesome (2 guys 1 girl, usually with a couple) scene too. And there is a market for Asian guys. There’s even a market where some girls prefer a smaller dick (I’m about 5 inches). 

If you want sex, you put yourself out there, you’ll get it. If you want a relationship and you’re serious about it, and put yourself out there (and not totally repulsive and can’t talk at all), you’ll get it. But make no mistake about it finding someone you’re really compatible with is very very difficult. And even then divorce rates are still sky high. It’s important not to get discouraged. Sometimes we need a break and re-evaluate ourselves to see what we really want. When we know what it is, it’s easier to try, try and try again after failures. Or (sobs) life lessons.

False,GideonD,1447858400.0,,,,,,t2_s5ua9,"A staple is made of a more flexible steel. A screw is a much harder steel since it has to handle the torque of being twisted in. That said, it really depends on the screw you use. In the US we don't commonly use screws to install floors. After researching your ""secret screws"" as used in flooring in Europe, it looks very similar to what we call a trim screw. These are thinner screws with very small heads that are meant to be self drilling and recess into the wood. The top part of the shaft is unthreaded and thus would allow the wood floor to shift on it a little as it moves. So technically there would be no difference in movement with this type of screw. 

Staples are generally used over here because of cost and convenience. They are divergent point and glue coated so when the go in they twist apart and the adhesive on them locks into the wood fiber. Generally they hold very well. Even better, though less commonly used now, are floor cleats. These are also fired from a pneumatic nailer, but are more similar to old style ""cut nails"" with the addition of barbs for even greater holding power. We still use them a fair amount on harder floors such as strand woven bamboo since they are less prone to splitting the wood. 

All that in mind, the real best answer for why we use staples or cleats instead of screws is because screws take a lot longer and cost a lot more. I can buy a box of 5000 floor staples for less than $30. A 1000 count box of good trim screws will cost me $50. I can staple or cleat nail a fastener at the rate of about 1 per 2-3 seconds including moving the nailer along. Screws could take a minute or two each depending on how easily they start and how good you are at keeping your angle correct. That makes for a lengthy and expensive install. I could literally buy my own nailer and all the fasteners I need for the price of the screws I'd need and I'd be preserving my sanity at the same time. Also the flooring nailers are designed in such a way that the force of impact, whether manual or air assisted, seats the board firmly against the previous board while it inserts the fastener, making for a tighter joint. They are very well designed to do their intended job. Nothing quite like that exists for screws.

Não vou menosprezar seus problemas, mas, salvo raras exceções, sempre há uma cura para os males que te afligem.

Se você perdeu ou não seus amigos por ser um ""lixo total"", isso já não importa mais. Se esse foi mesmo o caso, passou; se crucificar eternamente não vai te fazer se sentir melhor nem trazê-los de volta. Se você acha que errou, basta reconhecer de maneira sincera o erro, e tentar ativamente não repeti-lo novamente. Isso sem nem falar de que há a possibilidade de que você esteja sendo mais dura do que o necessário consigo mesma. Você mesmo diz ter depressão e distúrbio de personalidade, e sei muito bem que essas características às vezes fazem com que nos culpamos por problemas que talvez nem sejam tão nossa culpa assim.

O primeiro passo pra mudar sua situação é por mais óbvio que possa parecer, ter a vontade de mudar. E esse passo você parece já ter dado, o que por mais que não pareça, é algo muito bom. Tendo vontade, é só tentar. Não há uma fórmula pra felicidade, então tente, experimente coisas e veja o que te satisfaz. Terapia, religião, estudo, esportes, tem muita coisa que pode te ajudar a se sentir melhor consigo mesma (e eu particularmente recomendaria voltar com alguma forma de tratamento mental). Eu sei que é um pouco sem noção eu dizer que ""é só tentar"" sem praticamente a menor ideia da sua situação, mas é que eu realmente gostaria que você ficasse bem, e acho que é válido tentar coisas novas na esperança de mudar seu humor. Sabe, o reddit é um lugar bem grande, tenho certeza que existem diversos subs onde você poderia postar seus desenhos (aliás, acho uma coisa muito boa começar a desenhar só por desenhar, sabe?). Talvez seja bom pra você, não sei.

Sobre a pessoa que você ama. Talvez você esteja certa e o amor nunca será recíproco, a vida tem dessas. Mas talvez esteja errada e ela possa te amar. No final a única maneira de saber é tentando. Se vale a pena tentar? Só você pode dizer, embora eu particularmente não ache que seja muito esperto ficar sofrendo pelo que poderia ter sido se você nem ao menos tentou. E se der errado, paciência. A falha faz parte da experiência humana e saber lidar com ela é essencial. Mas você pode ter certeza que independente do resultado, a vida segue.

Enfim, acho que escrevi demais, mas só queria dizer que o seu destino vai ser o que você fizer dele. É claro que as pessoas tem uma ou outra predisposição, mas no final a decisão do que você faz ou deixa de fazer é inteiramente sua.

&gt; Santo &amp; Johnny were an American rock and roll duo from Brooklyn, New York.

&gt; They are best known for their instrumental ""Sleep Walk"", which became a regional hit and eventually reached the top of the Billboard pop chart when it was released nationally in 1959.
At present, Santo is semi-retired and Johnny tours and records new material with his own band. Johnny is also the president of Aniraf, Inc., an international record company based in New York.

&gt; Santo and Johnny Farina were born in Brooklyn, New York; Santo on October 24, 1937 and Johnny on April 30, 1941. Their father was drafted into the Army while they were children and was stationed for some time in Oklahoma. After hearing a steel guitar on the radio, he wrote to his wife, ""I'd like the boys to learn to play this instrument"".
Upon returning from World War II, the boys' father found a music teacher who gave the boys steel guitar lessons. When Santo was a teenager, he was able to get a local music store to modify an acoustic guitar, allowing him to play it like a steel guitar.
Within two years, Santo was performing in amateur shows on a new Gibson six-string steel guitar and had started receiving lessons from a steel guitar teacher who had studied in Hawaii. By the age of fourteen, Santo was composing songs, and formed an instrumental trio with a guitarist and drummer. This trio appeared at local dances and parties, performing both original compositions and some Hawaiian standards. With money Santo made from these performances, he bought a Fender steel guitar, one with three necks, each with eight strings. This allowed him to experiment even further, and he tried different tunings until he found ones that appealed to him.
When Johnny reached the age of twelve, he began to play accompaniment to Santo on a standard electric guitar. The brothers soon formed a duo and became rather popular in school, eventually performing at events in the New York boroughs. They recorded a demo which they circulated to local New York record companies.
In 1958, Mike Dee &amp; The Mello Tones (Santo Farina, steel guitar; Johnny Farina, guitar and their uncle Mike Dee, drums) recorded a self-penned instrumental which they called ""Deep Sleep"". Loosely inspired by the song ""Softly, As In The Morning Sunrise"" (Sigmund Romberg, 1929), it had the same chord progression but a simpler melody line.
""Deep Sleep"" became ""Sleep Walk"" and in September 1959 it topped the American charts.

&gt; The brothers eventually came to the attention of a music publishing company and signed a song writer's contract and eventually a contract with Canadian-American Records. Their first release, ""Sleep Walk"", was composed by the two brothers. (The original single credits three Farinas, including an ""A. Farina"" for the composition. It's sometimes reported that their mother or sister helped, but this is apparently false.) It was recorded at Trinity Records in Manhattan. ""Sleep Walk"" entered Billboard's 'Top 40' on August 17, 1959. It rose to the No. 1 position for two weeks in September (the 21st and the 28th) and remained in the 'Top 40' list until November 9. It was the last instrumental to hit #1 in the 1950s and earned Santo &amp; Johnny a gold record. The follow-up song ""Tear Drop"" was also a hit, though their LP Santo &amp; Johnny was less successful in the United States.
After touring Europe, Mexico, and Australia, Santo &amp; Johnny signed to an Italian record label and had several hits in Europe that included ""Sleep Walk"", ""Love Story"", ""Maria Elena"", ""Ebb Tide"", ""Love is Blue"", ""Enchanted Sea"", and others.[citation needed] In 1964, they released an album of The Beatles covers; ""And I Love Her"" hit #1 in Mexico and held the spot for 21 weeks. In 1973, Santo &amp; Johnny recorded the theme to the movie The Godfather, which went to #1 in Italy and stayed at that spot for 21 weeks. They received a gold record in Italy and were inducted into the Italian Music Hall of Fame.

&gt; Johnny Farina currently operates the official Santo And Johnny worldwide website, which includes current tour dates, discography, biography, trivia and new merchandise Farina also currently operates the official Johnny MySpace page, which includes current tour dates, discography, biography, and audio samples from his new solo albums.

&gt; ""Sleep Walk"" continues to be popular due to consistent radio airplay as well as its usage in commercials, television shows, and movies. One of the first covers was by Betsy Brye (stage name of Bette Anne Steele) in 1959. While Santo &amp; Johnny wrote lyrics for ""Sleep Walk"", they never recorded a lyrical version, but Betsy Brye's version included these lyrics. It has been also covered by The Shadows, Stray Cats, The Ventures, Jake Shimabukuro, Amos Garrett, Kenny Vance and the Planotones, Larry Carlton, Deftones, Chet Atkins, Danny Gatton, Leo Kottke, The Sir Douglas Quintet, Jonathan Richman, Larry Berwald, and Joe Satriani. Indie group Modest Mouse also covered the song with lyrics and entitled their version ""Sleepwalkin'"". A version by Brian Setzer received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance of 1998. ""Sleep Walk"" was used throughout the 1992 Stephen King film, Sleepwalkers. ""Sleep Walk"" also plays a role in the 1995 Terry Gilliam sci-fi film, 12 Monkeys. It is also played in the end scene of ""La Bamba"" after protagonist Ritchie Valens dies. The song can also be heard in ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" as well as in the film ""Hearts in Atlantis"" starring Anthony Hopkins. Tim Kring's 'Heroes' which aired on NBC also featured ""Sleep Walk"" playing on a record in a diner, from the episode '1961'.
Santo &amp; Johnny were inducted into The Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 2002. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt;I remember seeing that post and I definitely thought the woman in the photo was just a model and that the actual skirt was made by someone else and yeah, maybe I thought that someone else was male...Internalized Misogyny y'all

&amp;#x200B;

""Internalized Misogyny"" onde?  Onde ela sentiu ""Repulsa, Ódio, Desprezo"" por outra mulher apenas por ela ser uma mulher?

Esses termos perderam seus significados. Não significam mais absolutamente nada.

Mas e se ela tiver se confundido? E se ela queria ter dito ""Internalized Sexism""? Bem, ainda assim eu não vejo sentido algum em classificar isso como ""Internalized Sexism"". De fato os homens representam a grande maioria das pessoas trabalhando nos chamados STEM Fields, então existe um esteriótipo com fundamento na realidade concreta.

Qual é o problema disso? Obviamente seria ""Sexismo"" se ela pensasse que a moça TINHA quer ser uma modelo e não uma ""ciêntista"". Mas fazer um pré julgamento desse é completamente normal. Se ela estivesse com um estetoscópio no pescoço e um jaleco, você não iria pensar que ela era uma médica? Pesquise no Google Imagens ""Médico"" e note como quase em todas as imagens o ""Médico(a)"" está com um estetoscópio.

Outra coisa que me chamou atenção foi ela aparentemente condenar o governo Chinês por censurar e prender aqueles que discordam da ""narrativa oficial"". Será que ela por acaso defende a Liberdade de Discussão? Ou só quando convém? Tragicômico

Agora para o ponto central do vídeo, acho triste que o trabalho dela não tenha sido divulgado da maneira que ela gostaria e que tenha causado todo esse drama. Mas procurei o canal do youtube dela e ela possui 714 Mil subscritos. Então acho que ela está indo muito bem e com certeza está inspirando homens e mulheres a se interessarem mais por ""tecnologia/ciência"".

&amp;#x200B;

The US' aggregate economic power has not been damaged at all, as the US has seen solid growth despite the self placed tariffs.  All standard economic indicators are relatively healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Politically speaking, I'm not convinced there has been any lasting damage just yet, because all i've seen is talk, and no action that goes with breaking from the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

The EU has tried to form a consensus against the US on Iran, but when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of actually stepping around US SWIFT sanctions, no country is willing to put itself to bat for example.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there has definitely been a wanton use of US political pressure for Donald Trump's policy goals, but I don't think the rift that has come about on numerous issues, including climate change, will outlast Trump just yet.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, the Philippines went from a staunch US ally to playing both sides under Obama, imv a big contributor to that was due to how cautiously he played his hand with regards to Scarborough shoal.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing he's done from a foreign policy perspective while in office was to remove the US from the TPP, but the deal was unpopular enough that both sides had to at least pay lip service to leaving it, so it might have been inevitable, but still a shame.

&amp;#x200B;

He's definitely earned widespread ridicule, but public opinion is notoriously fickle, and international opinion is no exception. I have no doubt that the public will be reminded of how he is while he is in office, but what about in 4 years? I doubt it will even be news in 6 years, let alone a single decade.

The issue wasn't that Nero was a particularly good or bad ruler in general, but was smeared because of his actions not being in line with the aristocracy. We actually have little to no primary sources on Nero's life and actions. The three primary sources of information we have are Tacitus, Cassius Dio, and Suetonius.

Tacitus himself was a Senator in the years after Nero's reign, born a member of the aristocracy.

Cassius Dio was also a Senator a century or so later.

Suetonius was a close friend of a Senator, Pliny the Younger.

Any positive accomplishments that Nero might have done are theorized to be done against the wishes of the aristocracy or the senate. Tacitus says of his death (I'm trying to track down the exact quote) that the senate rejoices, but the slaves and commoners wept for him. Nero was also fairly well liked in some of the more far-off provinces, and there was a belief that he would return to rule again. There were a few people who actually claimed to be a reborn Nero and made a bid for the throne.

Additionally, Nero wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, and we have little reason to doubt that Christians were prosecuted and killed under his reign to some extent.

No Turkish govt has done more for Palestinians than the AKP, none have ever done the advocacy for Palestine the way the AKP has done. 

They completed the Largest budget in terms of foreign aid distribution to Palestine. The diplomatic push for Palestine is coordinated by Turkey. whether its meeting with the Pope for his support on Palestine, or talking to Merkel and other European Leaders. Hosting the OIC emergency conference to coordinate the response to the Palestinian question. meeting with King Abdullah about Jordan's role in the Palestinian issue and the about Jerusalem. there is a reason you see Israelis lashing out at Erdogan, both leaders and others, you can see it with the zionist lobby coordinating anti-Turkish efforts in congress.

That was never the Brexit argument. It was remain who had a lazer like focus on the economy because it was the only card they had.

New Zealand has dealt with players being stolen by the English Clubs, The french Clubs, the Japanese clubs, even Aussie League for decades.

The model makes several assumption, namely that energy has to be free at the point of use both privately and municipally and for that you basically use solar (thermal not photovoltaic) and for that to work you have to base tour arrays either out of Morocco or in space. With a launch cost of 500$\kg and the launch infrastructure to make that happen (10bn) putting it in space actually ends up being slightly cheaper Vs the cost of revamping the European grid for long transmission distances.

Commedia dell'arte is also known as commedia alla maschera, commedia improvviso, and commedia dell'arte all'improvviso. Commedia is a form of theatre characterized by masked ""types"" which began in Italy in the 16th century and was responsible for the advent of actresses (Isabella Andreini) and improvised performances based on sketches or scenarios. A commedia, such as The Tooth Puller, is both scripted and improvised.

Over the course of 20 months, CEU has taken all steps to comply with Hungarian legislation, launching educational activities in the U.S. that were certified by U.S. authorities. Nevertheless, the Hungarian government has made it clear it has no intention of signing the agreement that it negotiated over a year ago with the State of New York, which would ensure CEU’s operations in Budapest for the long term.  

“CEU has been forced out,” said CEU President and Rector Michael Ignatieff. “This is unprecedented. A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU. “  

The government has never even tried to pretend that there were academic grounds for their actions. The US Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the New York State Education Department and the Hungarian Accreditation Committee have all certified the excellence of CEU’s academic programs.  

Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary. “The government has done an injustice toward its own citizens – Michael Ignatieff said – the hundreds of Hungarians who work and study at CEU, and thousands of Hungarian alumni and their families.”",True,False,False,,0,1543838816,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eaztv3m,True,t3_a2o246,False,t3_a2o246,/r/europe/comments/a2o246/central_european_university_forced_of_budapest_to/eaztv3m/,,1546362882,36,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Transylvania'}]",richtext,False,

Just gave you an example there.

&gt; Prove it

The right-wing populism in Europe is not the same as it was in the 20's. 

Like how can Polish right-wingers be Nazis for example? Not realizing that the Nazis had brutally invaded and oppressed them? It makes no sense whatsoever.

Also same shit with non-white groups, they simply can't fit into the same category as white-supremacists.

&gt; https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-young-men-of-color-are-joining-white-supremacist-groups?ref=scroll

Then by definition that group is not white-supremacist. If the group were white supremacist then the black guy would be stupid to join, but also the group would not let him join.

Now of course you can say they let blacks join just to prove that they are ""not racist"" as a cover. But this also goes both ways, because after a certain point, it just undermines their ideology. 

Like imagine a white-supremacist organization with 90% of it's members being black. It would become a parody of itself eventually.

&gt; It's really not that difficult to understand.

Yes it is because people will not just leave things at that, eventually the state will be involved in one way or the other.

Like take free assembly right for example. There was an example where they let British fascists and neo-nazis march in the 20's, because ""muh freedom of assembly"", equal rights no, totally libertarian no? But this is not a neutral stance actually. 

Because then they tried to march into a Jewish neighborhood and stir things up there, and the neighborhood refused, they tried to block the march. And then they had to bring in the police to beat up the people who protested and let the fascists march in.

So this is why this so called ""libertarian"" ""laissez faire"" approach can become pretty ambiguous. Eventually the use of force will manifest itself.

&gt; Oh okay, then you wouldn't have a problem if we use the state to create capitalist monopolies where only people who were born into rich families can own companies that exploit the other 99% of people, and we imprison anyone who even suggests anything socialist or Marxist.

How do you get to this conclusion? The structure of the economy is built on quicksand, it can totally change. Even corporate law is not even codified property but only based on judicial rulings. So it can totally change if democratic pressure is applied.

The Labour Party has threatened a contempt of parliament motion as part of its effort to pressure ministers to publish the advice as Mrs May begins a charm offensive to persuade MPs to back the agreement she negotiated with Brussels.
In an interview with ITV's This Morning, the Prime Minister insisted that she ""would still have a job in two week's time,"" as she called on MPs to support the deal.
The move comes as the Telegraph exclusively reveals that May's chief Brexit adviser secretly warned her that the customs backstop is a ""bad outcome"" for the UK which will see regulatory checks in the Irish Sea and put security co-operation at risk.
Oliver Robbins warned in a letter to the Prime Minister that there is no legal ""guarantee"" that Britain will be able to break off from the backstop, potentially leaving the UK trapped in a Customs Union with the EU.
Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, will on Monday try to head off the latest threat by issuing a statement to the house on his legal advice before taking the rare move - for the Government's most senior lawyer - of answering MPs' questions.
Ministers have been accused of ignoring the will of the House after saying they will publish only a ""full reasoned political statement"" on the legal position concerning the Withdrawal Agreement.
MPs from across Parliament have argued that they are required to release the full advice - including Mr Cox's legal opinion - following a binding vote last month.
Even the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs are keeping Mrs May’s minority Government in office, is believed to be ready to back the contempt of parliament motion.
And in his weekly column in The Telegraph, Boris Johnson said it was a ""scandal"" that ministers were withholding the full advice.
""It is outrageous that the public should be prevented from knowing the full legal implications of this appalling deal - when it is their rights, their freedoms, their hard-won suffrage, that are about to be bartered away” he said
Meanwhile, leading Tory Eurosceptics are warning that the BBC's planned leaders' TV debate will ""breach the concept of impartiality"" unless it involves a prominent Brexiteer.

100% agree that there is no simple solution, combatting climate change will have to take place on the individual level as well as all levels of government.

&gt; Biggest per capita polluter is an average american,do you see them giving up their 15l/100 km trucks in favor of smaller cars ?

Some of them will. Not all US states are the same, some are doing their part in fighting climate change, other states and the federal level, not so much. 

&gt; How about we ban all sale of packed water in plastic bottles ?

Interesting you bring this up, back in may the European Comission has decided on a pretty ambitious plan in this regard:
http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3927_en.htm

Among other things, by 2025:
&gt;  Single-use drinks containers made with plastic will only be allowed on the market if their caps and lids remain attached;

&gt; Collection targets: Member States will be obliged to collect 90% of single-use plastic drinks bottles by 2025, for example through deposit refund schemes;

And then there's the plan to be entirely climate neutral by 2050 that was proposed a few days ago:
http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20181127_03991927

&gt;  How about 0 coal power stations and going all nuclear and solar and wind but wait govt just made solar panels more expensive by increasing tax on them.

Coal should absolutely be phased out, but it's going to take time. Take Poland for example: the number has been going down year after year, but they still have 400,000 people employed in the coal industry, most of them in Upper Silesia. If you would immediately ban energy from coal, you have a social bloodbath on your hands. 

The US is a good example of what can happen. In the rust belt entire regions have been decimated by coal industry (and to a larger extent manufacturing in general) leaving.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn opposed the creation of the European Union (EU) under the Maastricht Treaty – speaking and voting against it in Parliament in 1993. During the 2016 referendum campaign, Left Leave highlighted repeated speeches he made in Parliament opposing Europe during 1993.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Lisbon Treaty on more than one occasion in Parliament in 2008.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn voted for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU in 2011 (breaking the Labour whip to do so).

&gt; In 2011 Jeremy Corbyn also opposed the creation of the EU’s European Stability Mechanism, which helps members of the Euro in financial difficulties. (This vote is a good example of how Corbyn votes with hardcore Euro-sceptics. Only 26 other MPs joined him in voting against, and in their number are the likes of right-wing Euro-sceptics such as Peter Bone, Douglas Carswell, Bill Cash, Ian Paisley Junior and John Redwood.)

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn opposed Britain’s participation in the EU’s Banking Authority in 2012.

&gt; In 2016 his long-time left-wing ally Tariq Ali said that he was sure that if Corbyn was not Labour leader he would be campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, whilst his brother Piers Corbyn also said that Jeremy Corbyn was privately opposed to Britain’s membership of the European Union.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn went on holiday during the 2016 referendum campaign and his office staff consistently undermined the Remain campaign. He refused to attend a key Remain campaign launch and also attacked government ministers for publicising the Remain case, saying they should also have promoted arguments in favour of Leave vote. The Director of the Remain campaign, himself a Labour member and candidate, said, “Rather than making a clear and passionate Labour case for EU membership, Corbyn took a week’s holiday in the middle of the campaign and removed pro-EU lines from his speeches”. During the referendum campaign, Leave.EU highlighted Corbyn’s attacks on Europe made in 1996.

&gt; The day after the European referendum in 2016, Jeremy Corbyn called for the immediate invocation of Article 50 – the two-year notice to leave the EU – much quicker than even Theresa May wanted.

&gt; In December 2016, Jeremy Corbyn voted in Parliament in favour of the UK leaving the EU and for the process to start no later than 31 March 2017.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn three times voted in February 2017 in favour of the Prime Minister starting the process of leaving the European Union.

&gt; During the 2017 general election, the independent Channel 4 Factcheck service found very little difference between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May over Europe.

&gt; In the summer of 2017, Jeremy Corbyn opposed Britain remaining in the Single Market. He even sacked from his team Labour MPs who voted in favour of membership of the Single Market.

If it weren't for that, then I'd be against her but not against her reasoning which is very just, Neo-Nazi's should be denounced worldwide  and reporters should be allowed to report on them without harassment from the government, that's utterly insane.

A quick and dirty translation would be: 
&gt; It was found that there was an proportionally higher share of males from the countries Pakistan (90,2 %), Morokko (77,7 %), Somalia (74,9 %), Afghanistan (73,2 %), Irak (71,4 %) und Syria (70,8 %).

Regarding the Age group the relevant paragraph would be:

&gt; Die Altersstruktur der Zuzugsbevölkerung unterscheidet

Rough translation:

significantly from the total population (Germans and foreigners). The newcomers have a high percentage of younger and middle aged persons  (18 to 40 years): In 2015 there were 4/5 (80.0%) of people under the age of 40; in the total population, however, this proportion was only 42.8 %.


So there you have it. It's not that ""all"" the immigants are male (80%) and 18-40 years old (between 70 and 90%), but the imbalance is significant and large enough to not just blindly gloss over it by comparing this particular demographic to the German (or EU) population as a whole.

Nessa altura, havia lobos na serra e alguns dos idosos eram devorados pelos animais.

Certo dia, um homem levava o seu velho pai às costas,  subindo a serra, para o largar. Quando chegou ao alto, deitou o pai e, com pena, tapou-o com uma manta que levava, despedindo-se e afastando-se, a pé. De repente, o pai chamou-o. O filho voltou para junto dele.

- Não, filho, leva esta metade; chega-me meia. Guarda a outra parte para quando os teus filhos te vierem cá  abandonar.

Sentou-se e pensou : "" O meu pai tem razão: quando eu tiver a idade dele, os meus filhos também me abandonarão na serra e, acima de tudo,  ele é meu pai."" Arrependido, voltou a subir a serra, pôs o pai às costas e levou-o de novo para casa.

But you can see that this argument is factually wrong if it's what Corbyn's saying. 

&gt;  Isn't it more import for us Westerners to oppose at the West's side of the conflict? After all, that's what we can affect.

Might be true if ""we"" is activists. But Corbyn isn't an activist, he's not even a back bench MP. He's the leader of the opposition with a shot at becoming Prime Minister. There's plenty of stuff a UK Prime Minister could do to hurt Putin. They could push for sanctions, which is what Theresa May did after the Salisbury poisonings. They could seize money held by Putin's allies in the UK. At the extreme the PM could send the tanks in to push Putin out of the Ukraine. 

Obviously I can't see inside Corbyn's head. But when Putin orders a hit on British soil, and every authority in the UK and EU is saying it's Putin; but Corbyn is defending Russia. Either he is genuinely and emotionally invested in siding with Russia; or he's playing 4D chess and siding with Russia because it holds the West to account and what he says about Russia doesn't matter anyway. 

And I can't see this as a 4D chess move; because anyone smart enough to play 4D chess would be smart enough to realise that a better way to hold the west to account is to side with the innocent part, criticise the brutal dictator, and collect votes until you become Prime Minister then use the powers of that office to hold the West to account. 

This is what I said about the way hate finds a justification even to the people who feel the hate. While a student activist might genuinely do a utilitarian calculation and conclude they should side against the West. Corbyn would have to be an idiot to conclude a potential PM should do the same.

no since any non leftist opinions are shunned,but heavily leftist politics oriented subs like r/politics and r/news give a really good picture on the leftist mindset

&gt; What most people are referring to when they say ""illegal immigrants are bad"" is people seeking asylum from war-torn countries, which, as per the law, is legal to do regardless of how you originally entered the country. Perhaps because lawmakers realized, once upon a time, that people who were desperate enough to throw away their lives to seek help in a foreign country have more pressing concerns than ""Am I crossing this border at one of the designated locations, which I may or may not have any capability of having knowledge about at all?"" 

no not really,i can give you some insight:i live in a shitty country,not war torn by any means but pretty shitty,we have the same situation with europe mexico has with America,there are litterally millions of illegals from my country in europe,literal millions,most illegal immigrants are economic migrants who want to live in the ""western paradise"",i'd actually like you to give me an actual refugee to economic migrant ratio statistic

&gt; Otherwise, a lot of actual, honest-to-god illegal immigration is people that migrated here legally, and stayed illegally after their visas expired, and I can guarantee you that ""border policy"" is going to do absolutely fuck-all about this group of people, given that they're already in the country, and aren't entering illegally

obviously inforcing the border is not enough but that doesn't mean it's unecessary,take the example of my country,most illegal immigrants go to europe from here by boat,if european countries had a decent coast guard not as many illegals would arrive there,the best way to combat this visa fraud is to enforce fmore stringent legistlation

you may dislike them but their [arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/) still hold merit

&gt; Personally, I've gotten a lot more of the name-calling from the right than the left. You really don't have to go very far into [/r/The\_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald) to find someone calling someone else a cuck, libtard, pussy, and other emasculating terms (because they see masculinity as the end-all be-all for how people should act, but that's another story...) 

that doesn't contradict my point in any way,my arguments was that leftists name-call a lot

&gt; Should also mention that, generally, the people the Left are talking about when they talk about Nazis are... Actual Nazis. Like, not... ""We're name-calling them Nazis because they're the right and they're bad."" But like, actual people who present themselves as neo-nazis, wear Nazi outfits, repeat Nazi slogans, promote Nazi symbols. They took on that identity for themselves, we didn't even have to *give* it to them.

By and by I got into a relationship with a woman in a relatively impoverished European country and realised that if we were to ever meet, I'd have to go there.

Well I was happy enough knocking about with my mates, living from dole payment to dole payment (back when you only needed to take a tenner to the pub, and 50p for the pool table), but I set out for London to take a job as a charity fundraiser.

I did a bit of this and that in London, sleeping rough and working all the hours I could get. I made a good bit of money that summer, but when I returned home, to my mate's sofa, things had moved on and I'd missed a lot. I did it again next year and when I came home again my friend (the one whose sofa I lived on) was suddenly a heroin addict with a load of heroin addict friends. I eventually left town for good.

The biggest thing I miss is having friends to knock about with. Like, I'll never again walk into a pub where I know everyone, or be able to meet people who I'm already linked to by mutual friends. No more hanging out in the square, aimlessly missioning off on some smalltown errand. No community.

Een overheid moet zich aan de wet houden doen ze dat niet dan kan de rechterlijk macht optreden.

Hoe gaat dit ? Door het geheel van belgische , europese en internationale overeenkomsten en akkoorden van belgie te bekijken en een oordeel te vellen.

Dus neen het hoeft helemaal niet in de belgische wet te staan om door een rechter gebruikt te worden. Het is dat wal al deze experten naar verwijzen.

Om een concreet voorbeeld te geven, in dit akkoord staat dat oplsuiting ten alle kosten moet vermeden worden en enkel als laatste middel gebruikt mag worden. Een rechter kan (als een iemand een rechtzaak aanspant tegen belgie omdat belgie wel degelijk regelmatig migranten oplsuit) dit dan gebruiken om te zeggen dat eerste alle andere middelen moeten uitgeput worden voor belgie dit mag doen en dat die migranten moeten vrijgelaten worden.

&gt;I want to know how these tariffs are going to stop China’s IP theft - if you can give me a good argument for that I’ll believe that Trump is doing a great job.

The same way we stop any other behavior. Geopolitical pressure comes down to 1) calling out a problem and 2) applying pressure either economically or militarily. Nobody wants a military option with China so that leaves economically. For poorer countries you do this with sanctions or taking away aid. For rich countries its tariffs or buying less stuff (which is what tariffs does). If they go along you reduce pressure and vice versa. Simple carrot and stick. 

In the last 24 hours they've agreed to control fentanyl which they've known has been killing 30,000 Americans a year along with the tariff break. Each side has their wants and issues like IP theft are going to be on the negotiation table just like fentanyl and every other questionable business practice.

I happen to think there is a difference and Russia has passed below my ""we should expand our business ties"" line on my chart of what relations we should have. You seem to have just drawn a circle around a map of the world which means you'd do business with anyone from the Taliban to North Korea.

and yeah whatever, it costs more to buy gas and change to electricity, such is life, too bad, make an effort at least. French/Dutch/German movements at the moment are to expand business relations with Russia through Nord Stream. Blood diamonds are cheaper than other ones as well - I assume you'd just run yours under the tap if you bought one? Laughing at the fools who went for the non-bloody option.

lol no, there's just more vanilla Germans than there are Brits living in NL, plus you don't write like a native speaker. Plus you are citing Russian talking points about Poroshenko and the Ukrainians, been reading Sputnik news hm?

Regardless, you haven't confirmed you own your own house, and as such (utilising your own system of economic hierarchy to legitimise talking points) I am right and you are wrong.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Spain

* Spain has a ton of ex-colonies, mostly in Latin America, that speak Spanish.  If you live there and speak Spanish and want to move to Europe, Spain makes for an obvious destination.

* For whatever reason, it's a popular destination for Romanians.

* If you're a Brit who wants sun, Spain is close and sunny.  Internally in the US, it's common for people to move south when they retire.  My expectation is that the EU will tend to do the same thing, though language barriers will slow that.

I dunno what the deal is with so many people from Morocco.  Probably not language:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco

&gt;Morocco's official languages are Arabic and Berber.[129][130] The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija. Approximately 89.8% of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic.

-

&gt; In 2008, Frédéric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population.[133] The 2004 population census reported that 28.1% of the population spoke Berber.[131]

-

&gt; French is widely used in governmental institutions, media, mid-size and large companies, international commerce with French-speaking countries, and often in international diplomacy. French is taught as an obligatory language at all schools. In 2010, there were 10,366,000 French-speakers in Morocco, or about 32% of the population.[134][note 1]
&gt;
&gt;According to the 2004 census, 2.19 million Moroccans spoke a foreign language other than French.[131] English, while far behind French in terms of number of speakers, is the first foreign language of choice, since French is obligatory, among educated youth and professionals.
&gt;
&gt;According to Ethnologue, as of 2016, there are 1,536,590 individuals (or approximately 4.5% of the population) in Morocco who speak Spanish.[135] Spanish is mostly spoken in northern Morocco and the Spanish Sahara because Spain had previously occupied those areas.[136] Significant portion of Northern Morocco receives Spanish media, television signal and radio airwaves, which reportedly facilitate competence in the language in the region.[137]
&gt;
&gt;After Morocco declared independence in 1956, French and Arabic became the main languages of administration and education, causing the role of Spanish to decline.[137]

in countries with no freedom of speech (china), they can do whatever they want to against their workers and no one can even complain. in the west, we're a bit more lucky. the capitalist elite have to keep people _juuust_ happy enough not to make a fuzz about it. post-french revolution, the kings of europe hushed it down, and tried to conceal the spread of the revolution, to keep themselves stable on the throne. it's the exact same thing now, with the right wing elite treating the right-wing workers like crap, and making them take that anger out on minorities. it amazes me how people can go ""immigrants are stealing our jobs"" and not notice that your employer is picking the cheapest option; and it sure makes them happy when the hate is towards the replacement, not the employer.

capitalism is also slowly killing our planet. the factories, the overproduction, the underconsumption; all in a downward spiral. the only good things that i can think of about capitalism is that it's very efficient at generating economic growth. but that's it. we could reform the system for everyone's benefit, but that's not what the elites want; so they make the masses think that it's bad for them. the left wing ""markets"" itself about being inclusive, and the right wing doesn't.

the thing you have to realize is that there is no such thing as money, business or property. they are man-made constructs to solve problems we have. money equals power and time, and that's what matters in our society, so of course the elite want to keep it.

Either you've been blind to the culture wars going on, are too bluepilled have a discussion with ATM, or you're concern-trolling me. 

Loads these days literally wish to quote: ""deconstruct"" the west. Neo-marxism, sows racial resentment and attacks  Europeans for their 'privilege'.  Western civilization and it's accomplishments are also unique.  In erasing what it's accomplished, humanity would face great setbacks. Here's exactly what was said In the video I'd linked earlier to imagery of refugees.

That was by the world economic forum. Elites wish to bring disparate groups together, and inflame tensions between them, and in some cases,  push equity of outcome doctrines among them.. This keeps them from ever looking up.  Some Inequality has reasons to exist, and is good/necessary. 


&gt; *Let’s look at what we know,* 

You're claiming to state what ""we know"", as if it's the truth, or as if I and others have accepted it.

&gt; Let’s look at what we know, climate is changing and areas are becoming less stable, less hospitable etc. This drives immigration, not everything needs to be a conspiracy, can’t live in your country anymore and ‘over there’ looks nice, we’ll I’m gonna go and try to live ‘over there’.

Your thesis here is laughable. It's something that people research themselves if they want. It's been estimated that billions have been spent on coercing foreigners to move.

No, it's not, but I don't trust our courts and judges because they live in magic castles in the sky and have no idea what it's like to be a normal citizen, so they've kind of lost perspective on what it's like to feel threatened by some criminal - which is what I said in my earlier post to begin with. I'd say the court statistics and crime rates/conviction rates are pretty strongly in my court (heh) on that one.

&gt;That would mean they can legally beat you up for any reason.

No, that is moronic. No one said it was legal. I just said that - depending on context - I would find it absolutely fitting if this turd had threatened someone earlier, or endangered someone by throwing molotvs or whatever, and got a bit of a beating for it. Good for him, we're too fucking lenient on violent crime in Europe - it's hard to understand the level of terror you experience when you come face to face with someone that's a direct threat to your life, even if you end up not getting hurt.

&gt;You can't allow police to go around and beat up people because they personally made the subjective decision that those people deserve it.

No, I can't because I don't have that authority vested in me - but I'm pretty sure both governments, judges and police departments frequently find themselves making that call, and I'm sure they'd let it fly if they found the context for the beating suitable enough. The only reason this video is going to pose a problem is literally because it's evidence, meaning it'll be very hard to ignore.

Just think of it this way: You can't just punch whoever you want in the face, but if a guy gets knocked the fuck out when he's being a dick trying to sexually harass a girl, no one will intervene, if nothing else, no one will talk to the cops and he'll have no case at all. Laws are not computer code, and society would function incredibly poorly if they were as rigid as that. 

Mind, this entire story still depends on context. I'd say, he had to have threatened someone with a weapon for this to be ""okay"". But that, I can totally understand, would vary. The absolutist position is just kind of absurd to take, if for no other reason than it's not credible and it's just some virtue signalling about how principled and tolerant and yadda yadda.

That is not true. Just ask this [Imam](https://www.jns.org/nj-imam-palestinian-cause-is-islamic-but-must-be-marketed-as-humanitarian/) to prove you wrong. 

The facts are that in 1907, more Jews lived in Jerusalem then Arabs or Christians, how do you say that a Jewish majority has no right to sovereignty? The fact is that the word Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Quran at all. Yet for jews this is the most important place in the whole world.

The Qur'an Says That Allah Gave The Land Of Israel To The Jews.

""And thereafter We [Allah] said to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell securely in the Promised Land. And when the last warning will come to pass, we will gather you together in a mingled crowd.'"" [Qur'an 17:104]

&gt; Palestinians had welcomed Jewish refugees since the 1800's.

1800's Palestinians committed ethnic cleansing and genocide in Jaffa (1876) and Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895).

&gt; The issue was with European Jews arriving in the 1900's, in mass numbers, with the stated purpose of carving out a Jewish state out of native Palestinian 

Israel was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land. The yearning for Zion and Jerusalem has been a fixed part of Judaism and has been part of the daily prayers (3x) ever since the destruction of the second Temple.

I defend support building settlements where all other Jews pray(western wall), just like I support Muslims building settlements in Mecca, and just like I support Mormons building settlements in Utah.

&gt; British violently repressing peaceful political organizations of Muslim/Christian Palestinians who petitioned for an end to British occupation

Any Palestinian Muslims that rioted were let go. The British did not have any accountability for Arab revolt.

&gt; Also leaves out European Jews disrupting of tradition, by buying up land, and evicting the non-Jews who worked it for centuries.

Palestinian people's are indigenous to places 1000 miles east. Saudi Arabia, Syria, etc. You can use the last name to trace the origin once you meet one. This is why when you look in a Palestinians museum you see modem art and no artifacts from recent past. Most Arabs residing in this region arrived after the British beat the Turks about a hundred years ago. Jews created agriculture once the British came. Those Arabs migrated to the region after the agriculture bloomed because there was no good agriculture in Arabian desert. Arabs are known for livestock and the trade of agriculture peaked their interest.

Regardless of the length of the timeframe of Jewish depopopulation events, Jews have the right to live there under indigenous pretexts. They have the right to live there without threats about thievery on lands for which they are indigenous to.

Some Palestinians share common ancestry with indigenous peoples, but they neither follow indigenous traditions nor do they self-identify as those indigenous peoples. They share neither religion nor language with them. Blood quantum alone is insufficient to transmit indigenous status.

&gt; Palestinians to be forcibly evicted from the resulting Jewish state to make it Jewish-majority.

The Balfour declaration has no mention of India/Pakastani style ethnic swapping. 

&gt; AP leaves out that prior to the Arab-invasion, the Jews had already begun expelling non-Jewish Arabs from both sides of the partition, which contributed to the intervention of surrounding Arab states.

Super LIE.

Israel told Muslims to stay in their homes and that they were safe during Independence. The only terrorists were the Arab armies who came from afar to cause Holocaust #2, Israel edition.

""It must not be forgotten that the Arab Higher Committee encouraged the refugees' flight from their homes in Jaffa, Haifa, and Jerusalem."" -- Near East Arabic Broadcasting Station, Cyprus, April 3, 1949

""Every effort is being made by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and businesses open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe."" -- Haifa District HQ of the British Police, April 26, 1948, (quoted in Battleground by Samuel Katz).

""The Arabs of Haifa fled in spite of the fact that the Jewish authorities guaranteed their safety and rights as citizens of Israel."" -- Monsignor George Hakim, Greek Catholic Bishop of Galilee, New York Herald Tribune, June 30, 1949

Sir John Troutbeck, British Middle East Office in Cairo, noted in cables to superiors (1948-49) that the refugees (in Gaza) have no bitterness against Jews, but harbor intense hatred toward Egyptians: ""They say 'we know who our enemies are (referring to the Egyptians)', declaring that their Arab brethren persuaded them unnecessarily to leave their homes…I even heard it said that many of the refugees would give a welcome to the Israelis if they were to come in and take the district over.""

""The Arab states which had encouraged the Palestine Arabs to leave their homes temporarily in order to be out of the way of the Arab invasion armies, have failed to keep their promise to help these refugees."" -- The Jordanian daily newspaper Falastin, February 19, 1949.

There are agencies (IANA, ICANN, IETF) that assign numbers and domains and such, but they just advise, and companies/nations voluntarily accept them... so it's not like they have a giant data center or big red ""off switch"" at their disposal.

In practice, the Internet Backbone - the routing computers, data centers, and fiber optic lines that carry tons of data between nations and cities - is almost completely run by [telecom corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network). Similarly, almost everyone relies on a local ISP to link from the Backbone to the end user. So for example, if CenturyLink or Verizon decided for some reason to ""pull the plug"" and shut down their fiber lines, it would mess things up pretty badly. If your ISP is still up, its computers will automatically try to route around the damage and switch to another network, so there's still some hope.

An important part of the backbone is the underwater cables that connect continents together. If someone, like a military force, were to cut these, it could cause major damage. Say, European users wouldn't be able to connect to American servers, and vise versa. (Most big websites have Content Delivery Networks - I'm sure Google has lots of servers in Europe, for example - but I would imagine those are designed to periodically check in with some central server in Google HQ, so it would only last temporarily.) The tricky thing is that there are [lots of underwater cables](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/), and if you cut just one, the ISPs would just route around it. You'd have to cut multiple.

Some people have mentioned DNS as a central system which you could attack. This is true; I think there's some sort of root-certificate system which allows one to authenticate DNS servers, and this relies on a central authority... but I don't know/remember how it works. Maybe someone else could expand here?

Ultimately, the nice thing about the Internet is that it's more about the protocols and standards behind it, rather than the physical data centers and fiber lines that run it. You could cut every submarine line, and bomb every backbone data center, but in the end, you wouldn't have destroyed the Internet. You would have just created a bunch of independent, separate Internets. Will they be useful in that separated state? Not at all - at least not for the typical home user.

False,Cr1318,1386153653.0,,,,,,t2_e733t,"For American non-dividend paying (NDP) stock calls you never want to exercise early, from a theoretical standpoint.

Let's say you've got a call that's 1 month to expiry and it's ITM. You're considering exercising. If you exercise there's two potential cases afterwards:

1. You think the stock is fairly priced or underpriced, and you're gunna hold the stock after you exercise.
2. You think the stock is overpriced and you're gunna sell the stock after you exercise.

Let's evaluate case 1 with some possible scenarios:

* If sT (stock price at option expiry) is above K (strike price), then you would ideally want to exercise on expiry day and pay K. You wouldn't want to pay K any earlier because of the time-value of money.
* If sT is below K, then you'd be glad that you didn't exercise early because otherwise you'd have a bunch of stock that's lost a bunch of value.

So we can see in case 1, there's actually no point to exercising early if you want to hold the stock. Let's look at case 2.

If you exercised and sold, you'd be paying K per stock and receiving s0 (stock price at current time). Your profit is s0 - K - C. (C is the cost of the american call) Looks good right?

But what if we sold the call option instead of exercising it?

Basic options theory tells you American options are worth more than European options, thus if we can calculate the value of a European option, we can set that as a floor value for how much the American option should be **at least** worth. So let's calculate the value of a European option.

For this example, it's simply (as per Arbitrage Pricing Theory): c = s0 - Ke^(-rT), where r is the interest rate p.a., and T is the time to expiry in years.

This means our American call has to be **at least** worth s0 - Ke^(-rT). Your profit is **at least** s0 - Ke^(-rT) - C.

Now if we compare that to the profit we made from exercising early...

s0 - Ke^(-rT) - C &gt; s0 - K - C

Therefore, in case 2 we should actually sell the option itself, rather than exercising it and selling the stock.

Thus, you should never exercise American NDP calls early and can treat them like European calls.

Again, not a thing. Modern racism begins with the Enlightenment, and stems from scientific attempts to classify different groups of people. You aren't *consciously* drawing on this set of ideas when you say, for example, that black people are naturally aggressive and physically stronger, but *this is where those ideas come from* - not only those specific stereotypes, but the entire idea of categorizing ""black"" people *as a race*, or even what it means to refer to a group as a ""race"". The concept of ""race"" doesn't begin until the Enlightenment. If this is something you're interested in, you could start [on the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)#Historical_origins_of_racial_classification), which is well-sourced. Note this part, which explains the difference between modern racism, which has its roots in the Enlightenment, and what the Greeks and Romans thought:

&gt;Groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups, but such differences have not always been understood to be natural, immutable and global. These features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today. In this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought Europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.[35] The term race was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense,[15] starting from the 19th century, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.[36][37]

Your statement that ""people have been racist for thousands of years"" doesn't make sense, because people *haven't had the concept of race for thousands of years*. People have always disliked the nation-state next door, or the tribe across the river, but that's a very different thing from the immutable concept of race which was born in the Enlightenment. This isn't a weirdly specific or odd point of view; it's the consensus amongst scholars.

C'est une chose de se présenter comme étant de la gauche, mais concrètement, le NPD est plus similaire au parti libéral qu'on pourrait penser. Socialement, les deux partis sont loin d'avoir des politiques dissimilaires (le passage de Singh à Tout Le Monde En Parle après sa victoire est probablement le meilleur exemple de cela).

La seule manière que le NPD pourrait prétendre être de la gauche est d'un point de vue économique et c'est vrai que le parti ne courtise pas les grandes entreprises et les politiques de croissance comme le fait Trudeau, mais en même temps, il sont loin d'être un parti extrêmement critique du système économique actuel (ici, Singh est encore plus loin d'avoir affirmé le passé de gauche de son parti). Mais si on ressent encore le NPD comme un parti de la gauche, c'est surtout parce qu'il n'ont jamais pris le pouvoir et qu'il n'ont toujours pas eu à faire face à la réalité économique d'une grande puissance comme le Canada.

Le meilleur exemple est le cas de François Hollande en France. Après des années de gouvernement de centre droite, le parti de centre gauche de Hollande a pris le pouvoir en pensant pouvoir enfin cesser de gouverner selon les impératifs du marché. Qu'est-il arrivé? Hollande s'est retrouvé à implémenter les mesures d'austérité les plus sévères des deux dernières décennies, un *move* typiquement réservé aux idéologues les plus capitalistes du monde politique. Avec Hollande, la crédibilité du mouvement de la gauche a pris un sérieux coup. Mais on ne peut pas être surpris, à une époque où le capitalisme en tant qu'idéologie est presque totalement enraciné dans nos esprits, le travail des partis de gauche qui souhaitent critiquer la chose et mener un contre-mouvement politique adéquat ont besoin d'un sérieux mélange de courage, d'ambition et de volonté.

C'est pourquoi le NPD n'a aucune chance (et surtout au Canada), ils abandonnent depuis des décennies leur posture critique pour tranquillement devenir le parti du ""choix inoffensif"", le parti pour qui on est prêts à voter quand on ne veut pas voter pour les ""méchants"". Mais advenant une victoire du NPD, il faudrait s'attendre à une dérive à la Hollande, parce que le parti n'est plus qu'un parti libéral en puissance. Les rares moments critiques qu'on peut encore observer, généralement quand on parle d'environnement, sont plus dus au fait que la position du NPD leur permet une généreuse liberté d'action, parce qu'ils ont bien moins à perdre que le parti libéral. On n'a qu'à penser à l'écrasement de Mulcair en 2015 pour comprendre à quel point le NPD ne prend des gains que quand il incarne le mieux le parti de l’insignifiance, et surtout à quel point les gains sont conditionnels à l'abandon massif de tout positionnement qui pourrait être considéré comme controversé.

Le but ultime du NPD est de devenir comme les libéraux, un parti qui peut se permettre de ""défendre l'environnement"" en nous forçant un pipeline dans la gorge et un parti qui nous assure prendre à coeur le futur en nous promettant que celui-ci ne peut que passer par une poursuite de la croissance économique.",True,False,False,,0,1543862495,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eb0kqup,False,t3_a2pdh8,False,t1_eb0dkst,/r/Quebec/comments/a2pdh8/le_npd_fédéral_au_bord_du_gouffre/eb0kqup/,,1546375445,11,True,False,Quebec,t5_2qhh9,r/Quebec,public,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Décroissance'}]",richtext,False,

This makes little to no economic sense for Blizzard.  I feel fortunate, and I'm thankful to Blizzard, that they have had the sense to continue to support of older flagship products and I hope that they continue to do so at the current level in the future.

StarCraft popularity appears to hinge on some aspect of human culture that I can't begin to understand, and even then we have some kind of chicken/egg problem given the economics of the situation.  StarCraft is fun in the way that going to the gym is fun, which doesn't help all that much either.

I think that we can look at the current number of players and yell into the ether, blaming without general consideration of the fact that Blizzard has been _really_ good to us.  Free to play has worked out well and brought in new fans.  Starting with 12 workers was a brilliant change.  Coop was an excellent addition and could bring in more casual players.  It is very possible that Serral would have risen to prominence without region lock, but he rose to power during region lock, and that could very well be one of the most important things that have happened to SC2, IMO.  If Europe becomes a second power center for SC2, then the competitions will get more popular, and more exciting.

Blizzard continues to offer warchests and new ways to make money for the game, and I couldn't be happier with what I get when I buy a warchest.  This support, and the way that some of it is used for prize pools, is completely optional.  The use of development hours to try and make sure that all units have some place in the meta is completely optional.

As far as I'm concerned Blizzard has given us a fantastic gift.  Continued support and positivity in our community is what we can give back.

One other poster has written an excellent set of recommendations should you be US based, all of which is sound advice.

If you are in Europe though, though, I suspect you'll find some other brands more frequently than ( say) Smith Corona.

Late 1960's and 1970's machines are most common in my experience, and if you are in the UK you will find the following brands most frequently.

Olivetti Lettera (esp the 22) models are good and fit your small and light brief.(£5-£30)

The Olympic SF is another superb portable (£5-10), as is the Olympic Splendid 33 (£5-15) I gave my one to a journalist brother in law as a Christmas gift, and would love to find a replacement).

There are a few Silver Reed (£5) Japanese models that are very nice, and even later Olivetti Underwood (like the 315) models are very swishy and light to work with (£2-20)

The Olympic SM8/9 are tank like semi portables and, as mentioned elsewhere, are excellent. I paid £20 for mine in a case, and have seen a few at that price.

Earlier models abound, and are uniformly nice quality. I've picked up Remington portables for a few pounds, but seen very rough (inoperable) desktops going to £50, as people think they are valuable in any conditions. I've a lovely 1960 Adler that I paid two quid for, and the same for a mint green Imperal.

The prices here are carboot/garage sale prices. Typewriters start at about £20 in the specialist bookstores/writers cafes that carry them (Babushka Books in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight being the last such one I saw).

My genuine advice is rather than spend a fortune on one machine, get out to the local car boots and spend the same amount on a dozen or so varied machines.",True,False,False,,0,1543863865,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eb0mqmo,False,t3_a2po3w,True,t3_a2po3w,/r/typewriters/comments/a2po3w/i_know_relatively_nothing_but_i_want_a_typewriter/eb0mqmo/,,1546376362,3,True,False,typewriters,t5_2s5on,r/typewriters,public,[],text,False,

The Hellenistic period covers the period of Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. The Ancient Greek word Hellas (Ἑλλάς, Ellás) is the original word for Greece, from which the word Hellenistic was derived.At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, North Africa and Western Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

Steadily working on my list of unplayed games. Managed to get 4 of them played, bringing me down to 10 games unplayed for the year.

* **Spirits of the Forest** (solo, 2x): First game off the unplayed list. Played a two handed solo game that was very nearly tied. One side had two more tiles, so they lost. Followed that up with the solo rules as written. Almost won, but last couple of choices didn't go my way, and the solo opponent ended up with more Vines. This game is very pretty, but almost too light. And the solo variant chops out a bit.

* **Steamrollers** (solo, 2x): A great pick up and deliver roll and write. Again, solo strips out the expansion content, but with this one I don't miss it much. Played against Olive on Clerk level (easiest of the AI levels) and won. Moved up a level to Conductor and lost, though it was close. Should probably play Conductor level for a while.

* **Greenland** (solo, 1x): Also from the unplayed list. This kickstarter finally arrived. The solo/coop mode from the 1st and second editions was removed from the rule book, but that was the version I'm familiar with, so I set that up (leaving aside the Sea Sami folk) and played about half a game to familiarize myself with the rules before I move on to the solo variants in the this edition. I did eventually find out that I was playing elder die off completely wrong. Instead of rolling one die and killing off the elder that matched that number, I was rolling a number of dice equal to the number of elders I had and killing off all of the matches. It honestly didn't seem to make things harder the way I goofed. But other than that, I think the half game (still a couple hours, so I count it. :) ) was a good experience and rules learning opportunity.

* **Too Many Bones: Undertow** (solo, 1x): Played the 1PG solo November Dragons challenge (i.e., with a pre-set deck for encounters and boss, but your choice on Gearloc). Played Duster vs Vol'Kesh. The more I play Duster, the more I love this Gearloc. I won against Vol'Kesh even with a defeat on the day 7 encounter (burned through my treasure on day 7 as well). Duster and Nightshade are a wonderful pair. This game really has a shot at knocking my #2 game down to #3 next year for the Solo Top 100.

* **Orchard (9 card solo)** (solo, 1x): December challenge. I think I might be finally starting to understand this microgame. My score is one of the best I've had. Still in the middle of the pack of the challenge participants, but steadily increasing. Mark Tuck does a good job on his Print and Play games.

* **Disaster on K2** (solo, 1x): This has managed to sit unplayed on my shelves for over two years and was the last remaining unplayed game on my shelves bought prior to 2018. I have its brother **Disaster on Everest** and I also play a bunch of **K2**, so I am sure at some point, I conflated their names and I thought I had played this. This one needed some counter cleanup before I played, but once that was done, I lead the Serbian Climber team to a Minor Victory.

* **Cerebria: The Inside World** (solo, 1x): First play of this. Holy cow this game is gorgeous!! It's also a table devourer. I looked briefly at the solo rules and saw the phrase ""Refer to the main rules"", so I ended up playing this me vs. myself with 4 spirits. Only played the basic game. Setup took a bit as did internalizing all of the 9 different actions that you can take on your turn (that gets upped in the full game). But about halfway through I was rolling right along. I really enjoyed this game. Very happy to have backed it.

---

If I lost my board game collection, I imagine I would be out of the hobby as a solo player and looking for a new hobby. I'd probably not re-buy, simply out of sheer frustration. Looking at my favorite games, many of them are simply out of print and not easy to come by (small publishers like VPG, which has been sold, kickstarters that fulfilled but killed the companies, etc.). Some games I keep more for the memories than any desire to play them (The **Stock Market Game**, published in 1963, this was my family's ""Monopoly"" when I was growing up).

Recently especially in the Ahmadinejad/Mashaei/IRGC camp there has been a resurgence of Iranian nationalism but it is infused with Shiism. Even Khamenei uses nationalism from time to time to present anti-Western rhetoric. Humans are tribal, being a Shiite revolutionary isn't really any different from being a nationalist. You're just swapping one group identity for another. Most people will coagulate toward the identity they don't have a choice in, such as ethnicity/nation/race as this something others will hold them to more than religion since identification with the latter is more choice-based than with the formers. Not generalizing, but in a fundamental way one's ancestry, language and heritage are immutable while spirituality and religious attachment ebbs and flows, changes, etc throughout an individual's life and so it's evolution. National attachment also waxes and wanted but it is rooted in geneology and history, family and soil, hence it is more immediate and fundamental. Hence the trend toward nationalism, this tribal identity of nation, language and ethnicity will not go away, while modernization and globalization is chipping away at religiosity worldwide. There are differences between groups however; Arabs tend to be more attached to religion than nationalism as they are still very tribally oriented while Iranians were exposed to ideas about race and identity earlier during the European colonial periods.

False,Sirhamm2,1462396040.0,,,,,,t2_xoyfa,"Britain’s ability to keep the lights on has just been thrown into doubt by the European Court of Justice. It has ruled that the backbone of the UK’s capacity market energy scheme, which pays power stations to generate electricity, is illegal state aid and must be suspended. To call this a body blow for energy security is a gross understatement; as you read these words Whitehall is desperately trying to reassure generators and very nervous investors.

Payments to power stations through the capacity market have now been stopped until the Government can get permission from the European Commission to restart them, but this could take years. In the scheme, energy companies bid years in advance for billpayer funded subsidies to provide backup power from gas, coal and other power stations at crunch times during the winter.

Ministers are now appealing the decision and trying to get the Commission to approve the policy, which has been in place since 2014. A short term fix to try and secure enough power for this winter is planned but this is likely to mean much more imported power through undersea interconnector cables from the continent. Against the fog and noise of Brexit this ruling goes to the heart of the Prime Minister’s proposed deal now in front of MPs, where the ECJ will retain a key future role.

Shockwaves are already being felt across the energy sector as power companies will not receive the payments they successfully bid for and now face big losses; they could seek to recoup these losses through wholesale power prices. Another key question for a shocked Whitehall is whether the ruling means the Government is now retrospectively liable for payments it has already made. This would run into billions.

So far the capacity market has delivered investment in much needed new power plants, helped soften energy price spikes and ensured enough power is on standby to meet demand. It is not a perfect system but its loss could put up to eight gigawatts (GW) of new power stations at risk and force existing power stations, up to six GW or over 10 per cent of firm generating capacity – importantly those backbone gas fired power stations – to close years before they should. Supply issues will then become very real as spare electricity generating margins become tight and prices soar.

Importantly the European Commission cleared the capacity market scheme in 2014 thus agreeing to the key flank of the then Coalition’s flagship electricity market reform legislation.

The ruling starkly exposes how Britain inside the EU is unable to deliver an independent and accountable energy policy. But perhaps more critically in light of the Prime Minister’s proposed deal to maintain UK/EU state aid compliance and ECJ jurisdiction after Brexit, it shows why Parliament and UK competition and market regulators must replace the Commission and EU judges, in the national interest. It is important to detail the impact of EU policy on the UK’s energy infrastructure, nodded through by a subservient Whitehall over a generation and what continued alignment with the EU on energy, as proposed in the deal, will mean.

Since 2000, EU diktat has forced the UK to close over fifteen large power stations and build thousands of wind turbines and solar panels to generate electricity. Though many of the older and polluting power plants would have closed over time regardless, this should have been done when the market was ready to replace their contribution. Other EU states simply chose to ignore the Directives to maintain their energy security.

Remaining tied to EU policy, as set out in the Prime Minister’s deal entails a series of important concessions and cross-Channel energy supply commitments which will primarily benefit the European market and its generators. These include proposals from the Commission for the mandatory sharing of gas supplies which could lead to gas rationing in the UK following a severe weather front in Europe alongside a gas supply crisis there. This drive for more interconnection on gas and electricity is a leading pillar in the EU’s new ‘Energy Union’ proposals. UK plans to double imports of EU electricity come at a time when spare supplies on the continent are falling.

An independent and more competitive energy policy is one of the key tools to help make the UK more attractive to global investors after Brexit. The withdrawal deal as proposed leaves us entangled in a legal and political regime which can strike down domestic energy policies and fundamentally undermine Britain’s ability to cut costs and improve productivity. The ECJ ruling is timely if only to show MPs and others that maintaining policy compliance and legal subservience after Brexit won’t work and risks future prolonged and damaging disputes. Perhaps the judges in Luxembourg have just helped us fight for a better deal?

After I made the initial comment, I thought a bit about it and noticed:

1. In the beginning of the season, people talked about VVD - especially in retards to the PL - that he was the best in England. Which was fair enough at that point. But in the past maybe 6 weeks or so, I see and hear more and more people wondering if Laporte might be the best CB in Europe right now. So I can't really complain.

In my golden age i check every week nico nico for the  Vocaranking. But when i got the news of the European tour i again got excited, and it was obvious to call my friends and quickly  organized the trip's detail. Me and my friends always said ""if Miku come in Europe, we must go, no matter what"" 

I expected a great experience, though i must admit i was afraid of not knowing many songs in the setlist, but the emotions, the fun and the joy i proved saturday was over the highest expectation. Actually there was a songs i didn't know, but i enjoyed the experience of learning about a song in a concert. 

I met a italian guy,  10 years young than me, and i realized that he loved the same songs that i didn't know. Is the old/new fan cycle, no? 

I always love Miku because i think she is the result of a huge collective artistic endeavour, a bond that connect people trough art and her concert was a another proof of this.

Ok, she's not real but the sensation, the excitement, the atmosphere i feel was 100% truly just like the other concert i seen. 

The mass of glowstick, senbonzkura as opening act, Tell your world as final, my beloved Luka with Stardurst utopia and Just Be Friends, Meiko, Remote Control, the sad lyrics of ""glass wall"", Himitsu Keisatsu,  the great classic Melt and World is mine, the moving ""Even though my songs have no form"", Luka and miku's duet.

But if you say that another referendum would be undemocratic, then you don't want parliament to represent the view of the British people: you want them do represent the view of the people who voted in the 2016 referendum. Those aren't the same people, and even the ones who are the same people may not have the same views. Why would you expect the 2016 referendum to be a reliable guide to the view of the British people today?

To put it another way: if most of the British people want to stay in the EU, and parliament's job is to represent the view of the British people, then shouldn't we stay in the EU?

&gt; But the public have already decided in their view as a whole the benefits of leaving outweigh the harms. 

I'm not talking about the benefits and harms of leaving the EU. I'm talking about the benefits and harms to democracy of either holding a new referendum or pressing on without one. Apologies if that wasn't clear; you might want to re-read my post with that clarification in mind.

If you look at Ireland and USA, unemployment spiked up to about 10-11% - and yes, that's bad, but within a decade it's recovered dramatically. Both nations have undergone strong company growth and growth in their share markets, indicating business activity and a return to consumer spending. Both have drastically lowered their household debts (at the expense of rising public debt, however). I'm not saying it wasn't a wipeout - the US and European housing corrections resulted in a large scale financial crisis - but Australia is going to be ok in the long term. We have an advanced, predictable economy, and falling prices will attract investment as the usual supply/demand cycle runs its course. 

Im not saying it's not going to suck, but there *are* silver linings. An end to rife speculative debt and the severe damage of extremely inflated house prices is one such silver lining. (Remember, the crash is not the damage - our problems started long ago. The crash is merely a reflection of damage long since done.)

Personally I'd worry more about China. It's in the mother of all bubbles, and it's beginning to look very shaky indeed - and its recent increase in authoritarian insecurity is a very worrying sign. When China's debt bubble explodes, China isn't a developed economy, and doesn't necessarily have the regulatory structure or predictability to deal with a banking crisis. The authority of a dictatorship often rests with its ability to keep the people happy, and what's going to happen when hundreds of millions of investment apartments and millions of infrastructure projects (many of which are already crumbling) turn out to be worthless? 

Will Chinese people blame the CCP? And who is the CCP going to blame when its economy goes bust?

About 90% of the time I felt alienated as fuck in California since as far back as I can remember.  It was never my culture and after living on three other continents it still feels alien.  I was at a fair one day after being in Nicaragua and China for a few years and I heard a few guys talking about me ""oh, he's not from around here"" and I took it as a compliment.  Its a young culture without roots and it sucked up every expression of liberalism and globalism that it could.  I often feel that its a mechanized construct that plays out as people constantly imaging how they look from the perspective of someone else observing the person who is observing them.  Actors.  Its pretty much our ideal here and we've put out two prominent actor politicians.  At some point we became a parody of a facsimile.  California is from my perspective an intensified implementation of everything that the US has been manipulated into being.  You don't sound European, they have different issues.  Chances are by the numbers you aren't from California either.  Check out the Century of the Self documentary.  I think that its the easiest breakdown of the reason its so difficult to find genuine behaviour in America.  Many would consider 4 hours of intense documentary to not be simple at all but considering how many books you'd have to read its basically a freeby.  One huge freeing thing that you can do for yourself is to accept your alienation as a valid emotion due to your environment instead of what most of this culture does by instead believing that everything is correct and so therefore they probably need medication.

I'm half way through my second (out of 4) year at uni. I enjoy my course a lot but currently I just don't see any career that I'd want to go into and be satisfied with, and I feel that I'm kinda wasting my time if as soon as I graduate I decide to pursue something else that I'm more passionate about. I do understand that sticking to it would be a safer option as it would provide a backup if something were to happen to me that would remove my ability to fly. 

I've heard in the past that the job situation for pilots in the UK right now isn't too favourable. I'd certainly be up for working abroad - and I'd much prefer to do that than spending my career in Scotland - but right now I'm just taking my training into consideration, and I'd prefer if I could stay in Scotland for a year or two more at least until I get a private pilot's licence. Once I obtain my PPL I'll be happy to travel anywhere to further my training and seek out a career. 

Thank you for letting me know about Pegasus Finance. I read somewhere that some training companies (such as the European Helicopter Centre?) provide training that may be eligible for financial aid similar to what I get as a student.

Eu acho que você deveria primeiro conversar com seus pais a respeito, até pra eles não serem pegos de surpresa quando você tomar a decisão definitiva. Como é sua relação com eles? Você ainda mora com eles e depende deles?

Ao mesmo tempo, já vai economizando ao máximo esse dinheiro que você tem e pensando se dá pra juntar mais um pouco antes da partida.

Ainda antes da partida seria interessante pesquisar sobre possíveis locais onde você se daria bem pessoalmente (se quer cidade grande, média ou pequena, clima quente, frio ou ameno, praia, campo ou cidade, etc.) e profissionalmente.

E no mundo ideal você já tentaria até ir com emprego garantido, mas isso eu acho realmente difícil, já que a situação tá complicada até pra quem já mora na região, sabe o que quer e tem experiência, pra alguém de fora que vai apenas mandar um e-mail ou fazer uma ligação telefônica então...

Na hora de se estabelecer, aí depende muito se você já arranjou um emprego ou não.

Quando achar que já está mais estável no emprego e que juntou uma reserva bacana, aí pode pensar em alugar algo só seu, só se lembre de colocar tudo na ponta do lápis para garantir que terá condições de comprar as coisas básicas para equipar o imóvel caso ele venha sem nada (acho que tem gente que aluga a casa já toda equipada e gente que aluga apenas o imóvel, vazio), pagar as contas extras (luz, água, gás) e ainda manter a reserva de emergência.

Some of it is national (premature aging chronic sick population, aging workforce), some of it is local, some of it is political (Tory Austerity and privatization drive). It's not one problem. It's many problems acting as multipliers (compounding), not just ""more"" problems (adding up).

eg. Local: NHS Grampian.

* NHS Grampian got the lowest funding per head in Scotland

* NHS Grampian aging workforce, avg nurse age is +45 years, if I remember correctly.

&gt; [The median age of the national workforce has increased from 43 to 46 between 30
September 2008 and 31 March 2018. The proportion of staff aged 50 and over has
increased from 29.0% to 39.0% over the same period.](http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Workforce/Publications/2018-06-05/2018-06-05-Workforce-Report.pdf)

* NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, is more expensive to live in than say Glasgow. Thus, nurses and doctors have a lower discretionary disposable income, for the same work (eg can save less money for retirement). Thus, less attractive.

* NHS Grampian has a history of scandals ([example1](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/439398/Scandal-of-Scotland-hospitals-11-000-runaway-patients), [example2](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-30287223), [example3](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen/734970/734970/)). I don't know what broke the dam beforehand that is started to snowball. Then in 2014, [the chief quit because of differences between him and senior staff.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-29848327) And the new chief hired, in 2014, to rescue NHS Grampian, [Malcolm Wright, just quit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-44402025), [after also been tasked to handle the Tayside scandal in tandem (being chief of NHS Grampian and Tayside)](https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/774208/new-chief-executive-of-nhs-tayside-announced/). But Mr Malcolm Wright got already a new job lined up, [he will take over as (interim)chief of NHS Scotland.](https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/ex-nhs-grampian-chief-takes-on-national-role/)

Local/National:

* too much stress (understaffed) &amp; low pay &amp; low morale often cited why people leave NHS

* NHS, because of its standing in the public and politics, got an accepted and known culture problem. All NHS scandals have one thing in common: **NHS people (doctors, nurses etc) knew** but were afraid to raise the problem (patients came to harm, at risk, died) to the higher-ups because they did not want to be THAT troublemaker. And bullying and intimidation is permitted, but not whistleblowing.

Just google on google.co.uk ""NHS culture problem"" and ""NHS culture problem scandals""

Add the rising demand, not matched by money (Austerity) and staff. And that is where we are at, NHS is coming apart. 

btw: all rich European countries (Germany) are running worldwide recruitments for doctors and nurses to care for their (premature chronic sick) aging population, not just the UK. But Germany got no money problem because health funding (taxes to pay for it) have been de-politized and are increased automatically year on year if needed, although Germany has its own problems: hospitals are all private, private entities have to make a profit - for shareholders/owners, thus Germany, compared to other comparable OECD countries has the highest rate of heart ops, back ops, etc. tl;dr lots of unnecessary ops to fill the beds. An empty bed or an idle doctor does not make money. Thus, it is not unusual that doctors have targets in their employment contract (+a bonus for) how many ops they have to do, to make a department minimum break even, better, profitable. And it's not unheard of that chief of hospitals get consultants in which departments are most profitable and should be expanded, and which departments should be closed.",True,False,False,,0,1543880552,,1543882316,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eb19oeg,False,t3_a2bgkk,True,t1_eb140qy,/r/Aberdeen/comments/a2bgkk/serious_whats_it_like_to_work_for_nhs_grampian/eb19oeg/,,1546387084,0,True,False,Aberdeen,t5_2s70u,r/Aberdeen,public,[],text,False,

1-Burned Bridge by Edith Sheffer: it's highly specific to postwar Germany, but helps to show how the Cold War division of Germany shaped the development of two towns that had previously ""co-developed"" in many ways. It's an interesting process to see them split.

2-Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Batallion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland by Christopher Browning. Some academic reviewers take issue with his sourcing (using legal testimonies because if a lack of diary/day-to-day accounts) but I find it a strong account of how more than 80% of this Batallion willingly participated quite actively in the Holocaust. People like to ask ""why?"" and this book gives an answer (though hardly THE answer, nuance abounds).

3-Case Closed: Holocaust Survivors in Postwar America by Beth Cohen. I stumbled across this book while casting about for an undergraduate thesis topic, and loved it. In essence, it charts (through exhaustive archival research) the lives of Holocaust refugees who moved to America. Despite many reports on their rapid integration, the truth is mixed. Aid agencies rushed to ""close cases"" and get refugees off their rolls and into society to fit in the narrative of easy success. This book charts the reality they faced.

4-The Good War by Studs Terkel: a classic, through Oral Histories, we see how World War II impacted many lives of those who lived it. I read it in the context of studying how the US Military interacts with American Society coupled with the ""challenge"" of masculinity when men go to war, and found it very interesting from that context. Tim O'Brian's ""The Things they Carried"" is a bit similar (though very different narrative styles) and addresses Vietnam. It is interesting when viewed through that lens as well. 

5-for a random outlier in my list, I greatly enjoyed ""The Future is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia"" by Masha Gessen. Not academic, and arguably a bit more political and certainly more charged, but something I found very intriguing about how Russia has developed since 1991.

&gt;This three-drug cocktail (with some variations) was used throughout the U.S. for about 30 years. But in 2011, the European Union implemented an export ban on the relevant drugs. Born out of the EU’s staunch opposition to capital punishment, **this strategy has been successfully preventing states from obtaining the proper drugs for the better part of the past five years.**

&gt;For their part, pharmaceutical companies continue to fight back as states increasingly look for ways around restricted drug sales and export bans. When Oklahoma first used pentobarbital instead of the standard sodium thiopental in 2010, Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck restricted the sale of the drug for execution use. British manufacturer Hikma followed in Lundbeck’s footsteps. Even Pfizer is now restricting distribution of drugs that could be used to execute prisoners.

&gt;**Other states turn to compounding pharmacies (companies that make drugs to order), allowing the buyer to bypass mainstream pharmaceutical suppliers (and regulations)**. On Wednesday, BuzzFeed News broke a story on lapsed safety and other violations at the previously secret compounding pharmacy that supplies Texas with its lethal injection drugs. The pharmacy’s license has been on probation for two years after the Texas State Board of Pharmacy discovered it had compounded the wrong drug for three children (resulting in one child being rushed to the emergency room) and blatantly forged quality control documents.    

These practices are dangerous and can lead to botched executions.

Yes, it has had its declines and crises. But like I've heard people say before: ""It doesn't matter how many times you fall. What matters is how many times you stand up."" or something in the lines of that.

&gt; Also, we have about 10 years left to undo capitalism if we don't want climate change to destroy it.

What does climate change have to do with Capitalism? Are you one of the imbeciles that think climate change is man-made or some shit? In case you are, climate change is a cycle. There have been countless ice ages, and countless heat ages. It is natural. Yes, man is accelerating the process, but by such a little margin, it doesn't matter in the big picture.

&gt; No, not everyone know this. A lot of history was misrepresented, to put it nicely. I'm not the kind of Communist who tries to defend figures like Stalin, but I do recognize that a lot of that ""Stalin killed millions"" is false.

Stalin killed millions is false... So he didn't kill the millions of Ukrainians? He didn't kill millions on the gulags? He didn't say at any point ""we know lots of people will die in the battlefield, so let's give them less weapons since otherwise, we would be wasting resources""? He didn't massacre Germans when he took over Germany? Ok... Hope you have a nice time in your happy Communist world...

&gt; Fascism is certainly not Socialism or Communism. This should be obvious in all the historical conflicts between the two groups. For example, the Spanish Civil War.

Hitler behaved just like a Communist leader. He took over all private property to focus production on stuff he deemed necessary for the sake of the country. He talked many times about how the working man was what mattered the most and how important he was, and he also gave free health, education, and others. He obviously also took away freedom of speech, just like Stalin did.

&gt; Dude it's a manifesto. It's a format of writing. Are you going to pull out a furry manifesto and make a similar argument?

It's not about the ""format of writing."" It's about the message it contains. Both have 17 bullet points. All 17, practically the same ideas. Basically, you could say these two books fit the ""you can copy my homework, but change some details"" meme perfectly.

&gt; They purged the anti-capitalist wing of the Nazi party. Then they suppressed communist, socialist, and anarchist parties, as well as trade unions. Not a very Socialist thing to do.

Yeah, because Stalin didn't destroy all politic parties in order to have absolute control. Nice...

&gt; What if I did this for capitalism? What would you reply with? Take a look at Haiti, Colombia, or Cambodia.

That's three... of far too many countries that use Capitalism. What examples do you have of Communism working? Even the Soviet Union failed, so there's that. As for Capitalism, the US, and almost all of America is a thing. Almost all of Europe is also a thing. Oceania is also a thing. But because you named three examples of it failing, suddenly all successes are thrown down the plank.

&gt; No good Communist expects a couple of fellas to ""implement"" Communism in one country and expect it to be utopia. The real revolution is the one that happens across the world when capitalism fails globally.

Please reconsider your life choices. Capitalism isn't gonna fail. It is far too successful for it to suddenly fail. Let me remind you, that one of the economic powers of the world, the USA, is thriving quite a bit right now. Something you can't deny even if you hate the living mandarin.

&gt; “Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.”

Notice the word ""ideal""? That's because it is a perfect scenario. An scenario that is impossible. People WILL want to reach for more, to learn more, to do more. Believe it or not, PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT. PEOPLE ARE UNIQUE. Something that Communism doesn't take into consideration. Communism is all about working your fingers to the bone, only to receive the minimum needed to live. Communism is all about placing everyone on the same level. It doesn't matter if you are a natural born genius, or mentally retarded and can't do shit but the most basic of works. You will all receive the same amount of money. After all, as long as you can live, nothing else matters. YOU don't matter. You are but a cog in a machine. In Capitalism, if you have the abilities, and the will to go beyond, you will be successful, and will be able to show yourself to the world like the INDIVIDUAL you are.

 ""Cadê as provas?

 Marta Helena Gama nega que o marido, com quem estava há 15 anos, tenha envolvimento com crimes e pede justiça. Ela, que também é mestre em jiu-jitsu, descobriu a morte de Iraílson quatro dias após o desaparecimento dele e ainda não entende o que aconteceu.

 ""Família, amigos, todos estão inconsolados, sem acreditar que ele foi para outro mundo e sem acreditar na história da polícia. Nada disso muda quem ele era. Ele era maravilhoso"", diz Marta.

 De acordo com a SSP, o atleta teria sido baleado durante uma troca de tiros com agentes da Rondesp/BTS, no bairro do Comércio, após denúncias de assalto, no dia 28 de novembro. Um outro homem, que ainda não foi identificado, estaria com ele e também morreu na ação. Conforme a SSP, dois revólveres calibre 38 e um carro roubado foram apreendidos com os dois.

 Segundo Marta, Iaraílson saiu de casa, neste mesmo dia, para treinar, por volta das 11h. Ele estava sem carro. Depois disso, ele não apareceu mais. Foi no dia 29 de novembro que a família iniciou as buscas por ele.

 Marta e Sinho estavam casados há 15 ans e tem um filho de 12 anos — Foto: Reprodução/Facebook Contudo, o corpo de Sinho só foi encontrado no último domingo (2). Depois de procurar em hospitais e delegacias, Marta foi ao Instituto Médico Legal (IML) e descobriu que o marido estava morto há quatro dias.

 ""Meu marido estava morto desde o dia 28, e eu só soube porque fui lá. Antes disso, a SSP ainda me ligou para dizer que não tinha entrada nenhuma. Inclusive, eu liguei para o IML no sábado (1º), e me informaram que não tinha nada. Só ontem que me passaram. Quando eu dei o nome dele, encontraram no sistema. Ele estava com a carteira de habilitação"", conta Marta.

 Iraílson Gama foi enterrado na tarde desta segunda-feira (3), no Cemitério Campo Santo, no bairro da Federação, em Salvador. Dezenas de familiares e amigos do professor de Jiu-jítsu compareceram à cerimônia, incluindo o filho dele com Marta, que tem 12 anos.

 Marta diz que vai procurar a Corregedoria da Polícia Militar. ""Hoje eu não tive condições, mas amanhã eu vou procurar a Corregedoria. Eu quero justiça. Não pode ficar assim"", disse.

The US already has a butt of natural resources so a lot of my picks here are mostly strategic positioning, *especially* in terms of sea power. Control the waves, control commerce and control the world. 

North America: Canada. Mostly for the [shale] oil fields and combining them with the US's would ensure maximum energy independence.

South America: Unfortunately there is no country here that has access to both the Pacific and Atlantic. I would have used to make the American Super-continent something of a fortress using my massive navy. But, lacking that option I'd say Brazil. Lots of Natural resources, economy was doing well until... well, you know. that and It's positioned so I can have control over the South Atlantic.

Europe: The UK, isolated to prevent land invasion and would is perfectly situated where pretty much any country that wants to get on the high seas has to get past me. Also Gibraltar. 

Africa: This is a hard one, since I'm not familiar with geopolitics there. I'm just going to take a shot in the dark and say South Africa since it's a choke point for global shipping. Egypt was another contender due to the Suez canal but I felt I need to branch out more. That and use my executive power to end the racial tensions there. It's getting out of hand.

Asia: This is a *really* one given it's size. It's between Japan and Iran and I'd have to say Japan. I though of Iranso I could control the straight of Hormuz. But, I decided to take Japan, mostly to curb China and the fact that 70% of global manufacturing routes are in the South China Sea. 

Austrialia: It's a continent too. Do we get this one by default? If not that's fine; we'll be friends. 

Since this is MY country I get to choose the flag, name and anthem. I was pretty unimaginative so I essentially stole from Bioshock Infinite. Mostly because I'm creating America on a global scale (and on steroids).

Again my [flag and Naval pennant](https://imgur.com/a/76i9Nqj) shall be stolen from Bioshock Infinite. They're pretty simple and classy, which is why I chose it. 

National Anthem shall be something bombastic and rousing. [""The Battle Cry of Freedom""](https://youtu.be/bW4ZwyYJYbQ) fits perfectly. Some of the event specific references would have to be changed though, but nonetheless would largely stay intact. Though Battle Hymn of the Republic would work too.

Racist actions are already illegal in almost every context that matters (except university admissions, where it's encouraged by the far-left). Limiting speech won't stamp out the last bits of racism that exist in people's hearts. Though education might (which relies on free speech). 

My belief is that the hate thrives in darkness, and if people are unable to voice their bad ideas to be corrected, their bad ideas will grow and fester, possibly until they're acted on. I've had many bad or wrong political ideas that I've voiced on Reddit, and hearing solid arguments against those ideas has changed the way I think. I wouldn't have voiced those ideas if I was afraid of being arrested. You seem to believe that racism needs social networks and other people to thrive, and we'll probably never come to an agreement on that.

I've seen first-hand evidence that hate speech laws don't stop hate, and worse, they don't do what they're supposed to do. I lived in Germany and I heard a lot of anti-Jewish/anti-African talk once people had a few drinks and got away from their friends. They have this idea that Americans are racist, so I heard all kinds of stupid shit. It has been my experience that Germans, and Europeans in general are significantly more racist than Americans. Maybe Europeans are just more open about it, but that doesn't speak to the effectiveness of hate speech laws. 

All that Germany's hate speech laws have effectively accomplished was to cause certain video games to be banned. Now they're trying to use those laws to make [criticizing migration](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1052923/UN-migration-agreement-Angela-Merkel-EU-criticise-migration-hate-crime) hate speech. To me it looks like they're using hate speech laws to try and silence opposition parties that are critical of Merkel's migration policy.  

I think your proposed law would open a huge can of worms that, eventually, you would wish had remained closed. Under your law would Amazon or Netflix face punitive action for providing access to movies like Blazing Saddles, or American History X? What about Chappelle's Show? Would we have to white-wash a huge part of American history and pretend that racism wasn't systemic? Would we simply ban racist words which would effectively criminalize the entire genera of Rap music? If you think that's far fetched, take a look at the demographics of our law-makers. It's a slippery slope that we can see other countries sliding down. 

We get it, you hate racism. Guess what, me too. You don't have to go full-blown authoritarian to show the world how virtuous you are. Other countries are trying it and it's not working out well for them. Whatever those laws are doing, they're not reducing racism. And I would argue that those laws help racist groups recruit instead of hinder them. 

Thankfully, none of this discussion matters. Our liberal-minded forefathers already thought this out. The Supreme Court has already ruled on this. Your law to limit the thoughts and speech of your neighbors won't be passing any time soon. For that I'm grateful.

Immigration is already in pretty significantly high numbers. I dread what an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez type of government would look like. My country imports 0.8% of its own population per year. And they mostly congregate in the urban metropolitan centers because that is where the jobs are. And since immigrants tend to be poor, they can't afford to live downtown. So they move to the burbs, where I live since I can't afford to live downtown either. You see where I am going with this? I am being pushed out of my own city to make way for this cheaper labour and guess what? There are no new jobs outside of the metropolitan areas. And they come here and pack multiple families to each suburban home (which was designed initially for one family). And drive up traffic congestion on our highways and roads. They park everywhere on our streets. Sometimes they illegally block driveways. Rent and housing costs are through the roof here. I refuse to live like a Pajeet in my own country living in some little cuckshed room, having no personal space, having my Pajeet room mates dent my fucking car because there's no room in the driveway while working so hard for some fucking bourgeois fuck.

We need a near-moratorium on immigration combined with affordable housing construction and rent control until we get this under control. The conservatives don't go far enough on immigration obviously. However an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez presidency would give me a heart attack.

If I had my own political party, I would campaign far to the right of the Republicans on immigration and to the left of the Democrats on economics (except for certain things like free college). But such a political party can't generate major donations since the bourgeoisie want neo-liberalism and mass immigration. This is why bourgeois politics does not work. I suspect that in 10 years, maybe more, the west will shift hard to the rich and we'll have a Bolsonaro or Pinochet in there. Which is not ideal. But if the political left refuses to negotiate with the nationalists on immigration, what's happening in Brazil is going to be repeated here. In Europe the center-right is already capitulating to the nationalists to some degree. The bourgeoisie want mass immigration. But they also don't want the working class in their own countries to riot. Look at France right now. Holy shit. The people are pissed. It's funny to see Jimmy Dore and reactionaries agree on something (the riots in France). These are strange times.

&gt;Your opposition to things like free university is based on reactionary  supposition rather than facts. We had free college here in Australia in  the 70s, which was also the time with highest effective wages and  highest quality of life for the working class because it's before  neoliberalism fucked us all. It doesn't ""bankrupt the currency and  economy"" why the fuck would it?

Free college might work for some people. But I don't want to pay for some Starbucks barista's liberal arts degree. College is extremely expensive and over-rated. Some professions NEED college. But nowadays it seems like every white-collar office job requires college even though they don't learn shit in college that is actually applicable to the desk jobs they do. I only went to college because my parents forced me to go and offered to pay. And I hated my time there because I didn't want to be there and felt unmotivated and uninterested in the course material. I'm all for education. But college is not the only way you can get yourself educated. We have the internet now. And I barely had to apply much of what I learned in college to the real world. And the stuff I learned in college I could have learned on the internet or in a library.

&gt;but not if you refuse to support strong pro-union candidates like  Ocasio-Cortez on plain dumb Fox-News talking points type reasons and  instead support a neoliberal wasteland like Trump

I don't support Trump. But I don't support Ocasio-Cortez either because she would bankrupt the economy and destroy our material conditions if we just let all the migrants come in (ie. the Central American caravan) and drive up our rents and drive down wages.

Ha ha... like maybe after millions of years of cavemen living on meat ? Like maybe after all that time, meat will go away ?

You with your cleverly disguised plant-based propaganda. I was vegetarian for a year then vegan for 5 years, it just about killed me.

Pretty much the view here is that fructose competes with uric acid for real estate in the kidneys, and as the liver   clears fructose,  it increases the uric acid level in the blood.

I had gout so bad I lost a toenail last year, but the first three months on ZC my gout disappeared, even when I ate tons of sour cream, which was my nemesis. And even now, unless I SERIOUSLY eat tons of sour cream or ham, my gout is less than on omnivore diet. So based on my experience (basal cell carcinoma disappeared) and these references below, I will continue to stay the hell away from eating plants. This seems more like some instability as my system adapts than a real defect in this WOE. If meats cause flareups of gout, how come it disappeared on my all meat diet for three months?

Uric acid is an antioxidant, accounting for 50% of the antioxidants in the blood. Maybe it flares after 5-6 months ZC because my body is detoxing after 60 years of toxic plants, and it was prioritizing a different process for the first 6 months..

Also,  when you are a nation as diverse as the US with with the type of demographics we have with the population spread out as much as we are, it isn’t as simple as saying this will fix the problem.

You simply seem to not understand all of the variables and problems a system like this would create in a country of our size.

""In 2011, the French government stopped categorizing those deemed responsible for anti-Semitic acts, making it more difficult to trace the origins. But before then, Muslims had been the largest group identified as perpetrators, according to research by a leading academic. Often the spikes in violence coincided with flare-ups in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, according to researchers.""


""Gunther Jikeli, a German historian at Indiana University who conducted a meticulous study of Muslim anti-Semitism in Europe, called the phenomenon “blindingly obvious” in a recent opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde.""

""In 16 surveys conducted over the last 12 years in Europe, “anti-Semitism is significantly higher among Muslims than among non-Muslims,” Mr. Jikeli wrote.

“There is a kind of norm of anti-Semitism, of viewing Jews negatively,” he said in an interview.""

""Many French Jews have voted with their feet. More than 50,000 have moved to Israel since 2000, compared with about 25,000 French Jews who left between 1982 and 2000.""

""Tens of thousands of others have left the peripheries of Paris and Lyon, where Muslim populations are rising, and have retrenched in neighborhoods with larger Jewish populations.""

I agree that changes take a long time, but they are also coming at a steady pace with no signs of slowing and no attempts to stop them.

&gt;We are a very long way from demographic changes giving Dems enough control to change Constitutional amendments. That requires 2/3 of the House and Senate and 3/4 of the states to vote yes.

Go ahead and [look](http://archive.is/7C4NE) at the margins in the House races in 2018. How many races would flip blue if Democrats had 5% more voters? Now how many would have flipped with 7%? 10%? 15%? All of these will happen at our current rate of immigration/birth-rate trends. How long before Democrats have an uncontestable super-majority? Or how long before the GOP becomes the ""slightly less leftist"" liberal party akin to the ones we see in Europe?

&gt;Every single affront to the Constitution, from sleazy politicians and activist judges, are all temporary. A law being passed doesn't mean a law will hold up or that it's permanent.

You are somewhat right, but in order for what you are trying to say to be true, laws and legal precedent would have to be constantly questioned and tested. That isn't the case, many retarded Supreme Court rulings and many state/federal laws go decades or even centuries without being tested. Because the Judicial Branch operates through arbitrary determination, the Constitution can be easily subverted(and has numerous times) by judicial rulings that become precedent. Similarly, unconstitutional laws/acts can also go without being struck-down by the SCOTUS. Examples of this include gun regulation especially at the state-level, the Patriot Act, warrantless mass-surveillance, etc.

&gt;When Europe is a smoldering Islamic ruin, it will be very difficult for Dems to continue to demand that we be like Europe. Their collapse will precede ours by a century. And their failure, that example, will also protect us.

I don't think this is accurate because I don't believe liberals/socialists view France or Europe as a failure and they still won't in the future. There's a reason why defending the Soviet Union and socialist trash like Venezuela and Cuba is such a common theme in modern American leftists.

&gt;We need immigration enforcement, and we need a smarter immigration system. But the doomsday screaming about the American dream being over, is about as rational as the global warming doomsday screaming. IMO.

Recall that this conversation started with you saying there was no chance for France to save itself, while I disagreed. I'm not saying it's over, I'm saying LEGAL immigration at this level is a problem. Legal immigrants are far more likely to support liberal/socialistic policies than native-born citizens. Immigrants are also much more likely to require welfare than native-born citizens. Therefore, bringing in over a million legal immigrants every year necessarily suggests that America as we know it is in danger.",True,False,False,,0,1543887546,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eb1hme3,False,t3_a2ubm2,True,t1_eb1fkoe,/r/The_Donald/comments/a2ubm2/french_protesters_chanting_we_want_trump_sry_if/eb1hme3/,,1546390818,1,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,public,[],text,False,
