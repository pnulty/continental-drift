Ms May then calling an *unnecessary* General Election backfired as the Tories lost their  overall majority leaving her unable to form a government without the support of the hard-line Brexiteer and all-round nasty DUP,  and made her hostage to fortune to hard-liners within her own party.

States in the US have certain powers that the federal government does not, and that sometimes sets up some interesting conflicts.

The country is very much agricultural,first off. But unlike countries such as Japan or European ones, agriculture still very much retains that feudal structure. Most land is owned by a few landowners, or hacienderos, a structure that first existed under Spanish colonialism. But feudal hacienda land ownership was very paternal. Farmers lived on the land and had a symbiotic relationship with the landowner. The farmers would till and cultivate the land, in exchange, the landowner would take care of the farmer; giving them loans at reasonable rates, sponsoring weddings, baptisms, fiestas, etc. The farmer would pay tribute in the form of a share of the profit from their crops.

US Imperialism changed the structure of this relationship by turning its focus towards capital. Farmers became tenant workers who work for a wage instead of owning their crops. Rice fields became sugarcane and tobacco fields which yielded more profit but weren't edible. Middlemen stepped in to deal with farmers while landowners grew rich in Manila, away from their farms. Bureaucracy created a system of land titles which left out illiterate farmers who owned their own land, leading to their subjugation by US colonizers and Filipino compradors. The old feudal relationship was gone and was replaced by a semi-feudal one. The haciendero was no longer the father of a community, he was the employer in a land-based industry. This is the relationship that exists until today. Foreign corporations and a select few families own almost all land in the Philippines, while farmers and farm workers get shafted in the name of capital.

Now, I will confess that I haven't done enough reading on other semi-feudal societies like Afghanistan or Africa, beyond going ""Hm, yes, that sounds like mine"". But from what I understand, the relationship of land in those countries are very similar. It's feudal, but it's run like a business. That's semi-feudal.

[],EagleCatchingFish,1470866522.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_10bxxn,False,"Let's think about it for a second. To make a gun, you need the machinery to do it. You can do a lot with jigs, CNCs and stuff, but to do it economically, you need dedicated machines, tooling, and factories. In Eastern Europe, they have that. In the US, there are starting to be more companies tooled up to make AKs, but even that's developing. For non-ak com-bloc guns, the domestic manufacturing base is pretty much non-existent.

So anyone looking to sell these com bloc guns has three options: 1) make small lots using jigs and programmable tools (and miss out on economies of scale), 2) import the parts you can, fabricate what you have to, build the gun and sell it (again, missing out on economies of scale), or 3) buy the tooling necessary, bring in experts from foreign manufacturers, and set up a factory to build domestic copies of the gun. Option 3 gives you economies of scale in manufacturing, but your supply chain would be really complicated while you deal with foreign suppliers of parts until you can develop domestic suppliers who can make the foreign designed parts. Option 3 is the most expensive, but if you could do it and the demand was there, you'd own the market because you could make the gun cheaper than anyone else domestically. 

In the automotive industry, you can see this in the premier asian auto brands. Lexus, for example, uses a bunch of Toyota parts which are made in NAFTA, but a lot are only made in ~~Tokyo~~ Japan. Toyota would develop more of a NAFTA-based supplier base, but it just doesn't make sense fiscally with the volumes they're dealing with.

&gt;no stake in civilization. There is nothing to preserve for their children, because they have none. So in a pure egotistical sense, being a liberal is more ""beneficial"" to them as individuals here and now. 

uh a lot of Democrats only vote for environmental issues now and I think preserving the ability of the planet to support life is pretty important for people who have children or not.  On the other hand I have personally seen way too many Conservatives who only vote against abortion to virtue signal to Jesus and think we should destroy the environment to bring the Rapture sooner..  I wish I was making that up.  

I think this sub needs to mention every once in a while that there are more white people on the planet than at any other time, and people should be able to not have kids if they don't want to..

I mean for millions of years humans had different strategies for dealing with these issues.  When civilized nations decided it was international law to not allow warfare for purpose of acquiring land, it kind of sealed the fate of those civilized nations.  Any new people have to be absorbed into what we already have, and it's just one of many reasons why people are not prioritizing reproduction right now.

But they BOTH could have been stopped in 1936 if the British and French had been a little bit less Isolationist, and had the balls to do something, the Japanese Navy was not at all the size of the combined French and British Navies, and would easily 10/10 be stomped by the Battle Tested Navies, while the Japanese would be ill experienced. 

The Germans in 1936 had the Army comparable to Romania and Italy, The German Army was still outnumbered by POLAND in September 1939, by like 100,000 Troops (Correct me if I am wrong) which is kind of hard to pull out of your Arse, and Britian and France stopped Poland from Mobilizing it's troops to stop the threat of a possible German Invasion in August, there again another possibility to stop the Hell that was WWII, and then The USSR gets away Scot free after also invading Poland which was ""Garuanteed"" by the Allies.

[],6K6L,1490377167.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16gp6e,False,"Other such encounters include a person Andris knew during his college years who, after observing a phone call made by Andris who was speaking in his native language to his mother, expressed his opinion that immigrants should not speak other languages in America besides English. According to Andris, this person’s view was that if immigrants were to assimilate properly into American society, they should be required to only speak English once they came to America, abandoning their previously known languages. Andris informed in his interview that he did not agree with this sentiment and was able to put aside and ignore these expressions without issue. This concept is something that many hear when discussing the radical ideology that racism and ethnocentrism can bring. Luckily this is not a concept that has been endorsed in major politics, as part of America’s identity as a nation is being able to accept cultures of all areas to a reasonable extent. People of different cultures cannot be expected to give up specific areas of their cultural heritage based on radical whims and wants that make little to no difference in the functioning of society. 

Another aspect of American culture mentioned by Andris is the diversity of both culture and race found in America, explaining that it “took a while to get used to”. This is to be expected, as Andris himself explained that the only minorities present in his country of origin were Russian and Polish denominations, along with some types of Gypsies. Andris further explained that he welcomed the change in ethnicity around him, as it was interesting for him to view so many cultures in one place. When talking about himself being an immigrant, Andris informed that he was surprised how few of the people around him actually knew of Latvia or Lithuania, and how many of the people he socialized with were interested in learning about the culture (foods, music, people, etc.) itself. One of the joys of living in America is being able to experience the cultures of so many races and ethnicities. Speaking from personal accounts from other Americans, Americans have been immersed in so many cultural identities for so long that it is often hard for them to conceptualize living in an area with only a few cultures present. This is sadly something that is too often taken for granted by many Americans, and further proves the need for the acceptance or at least understanding of foreign cultural aspects. 

When asked what kinds of relationships that he has built since coming to America, Andris explained that his relationships manifest in both American born citizens and immigrants alike. Particular preferences are made towards having relationships with Guatemalan, Nigerian, and Vietnamese friends. Andris voiced his hypothesis that perhaps immigrants are drawn towards each other because of their similarities, also but explains that it is comforting to hear from others about their immigration related experiences. Luckily for Andris there is a sociology/psychology-based theory that explains why people who have similar qualities tend to mingle with one another. Social comparison theory can be defined as the process of thinking about information about one or more other people in relation to the self (Gerber, J. P., 2018). While this process certainly takes place through interactions made in daily life events, it is specifically more applicable to persons with unique similarities. In Andris’ case, being able to speak with others that have had unique experiences (different immigration experiences) allows him to find a community that identifies with him, something that can be greatly appreciated when one feels alone in a specific situation. Through these experiences, Andris and the people like him are able to bond and learn about the lives of others in their shoes, establishing connections and friendships that can greatly improve one’s mindset and quality of life. 

Andris also mentioned during this area of the interview that the other immigrants he came into contact with expressed their issues with dealing with racism and negative comments towards them and their nationality. Andris further mentioned how he had “never been subject to half of the stuff they have” as he can “easily blend into the crowd as long as he doesn’t open his mouth”. Andris makes a good point by saying this, as it is true that immigrants often come under fire for simply looking like a minority. Many forms of immigrant related media, including propaganda and hate speech, focus on the negative aspects of immigrant’s migration to America without giving equal consideration to the benefits they bring with their culture and ideals. Many races are prohibited from immigration because of the supposed harm they can bring to society, such as Mexican or Middle Eastern denominations, but American immigration policy is one that needs a massive reform to ensure that all immigrants are treated equally. If our society rewarded media sources with viewership based on ethical and moral news instead of wrongdoing and corruption, we would see this effect lessened, but sadly this is not the case. 

The last questions asked to Andris concerns whether or not he is happy living in America. His answer was a resounding “YESSSS!!!!”, exclaiming that he loves being an American, and is proud of the fact that he recently attained American citizenship. He further explained that he is happy for the relationships, experiences, and education he has received over the years and that they are just a few of the joys he has experienced being an American. Andris goes on to say that as a younger person he had always envisioned going back to Latvia or Lithuania when he was able to, but now he is content to live in America and plans to stay forever. The change that moving to another society (especially one with the freedoms that America provides) can leave a profound impact on any person, no matter their nationality. This is one of the reasons that America is heralded as a place where dreams come true, as while it is not a perfect nation, it attempts to keep the best interests of its people in mind when it comes to laws and regulations. 

Andris’ story is a happy one, with many ups and some downs, but an overall quality of happiness and adventure. While he left his previous home with doubts and feelings of sadness, Andris has been able to make a new life for himself and has found many friends, both Americans and immigrants alike. If every immigrant’s story was like Andris’, America would be a very different place, but the sad truth is that so many immigrants are discriminated against due to their skin color, race, nationality, and untrue accusations said against them. Andris himself has seen firsthand what racism looks like, both towards him and his immigrant friends, showing us that race is not a subject to be taken lightly when discussing rights, opportunities, and admittance. Change must be brought to our immigration policy to ensure that all immigrants are given opportunities that Andris was given, no matter their nationality.

You mentioned the European run so I did a bit of googling for the sake of being fair.

Rangers have played 14 European games this season, qualifiers and group stage games. Won 5, drawn 7, lost 2. 

Nullifying the European games would take his 54 games in charge down to 40 and his 26 wins to 21.

Which makes his domestic win rate **52.5%**. Still not great, and still fewer than Pedro.

Correct me if I’m wrong but I think the other 3 managers had longer domestic cup runs as well?

And they failed to realize that, no matter how much UK matters to the EU, it also goes both ways; EU was actually lenient to the UK and it reaped plenty of benefits from the membership.

And then it comes to the referendum. It *never* should have happened, nor should the UK public been allowed to vote on this. This is too much of a vast, delicate and complex decision to be left to the public to decide, who, for better or worse, have little to no idea what it actually entails leaving the EU. Hell, the reason why there are so many people who voted Leave and are now Remainers is because they actually didn't consider how Brexit could affect their businesses (an example is a florist, who voted for Leave, but is now regretting the idea because, since the UK probably won't be part of the single market, all the imported flowers he recieves from the EU are now subject to delays in ports, affecting his business negatively).

It also doesn't help how the media falsely marketed the idea of Brexit. For instance, the ""€350 million a week"" tour bus. It's a load of bullshit. UK sends around €175 million to the EU every week, half of the money they said it was sent, and the benefits that are recieved from the EU for that money make the sum negligible. As such, that campaign was a lie. Not to mention the patriotic propaganda and the idea of controlling the borders; nobody said that, in order to do that, the market would have to be split from the EU one, potentially destabilizing the country's economy, or that it would mean putting the border between Ireland and NI again, directly breaking the Good Friday and potentially reigniting The Troubles.

In short, Brexit was fueled by anti-EU and anti-immigrant propaganda, left for misinformed people to decide, and all possible ramifications and issues that would be expected or unexpected weren't considered nearly enough, or at all.

After three years of a colossal shitshow that Brexit was, I fully support the idea for a second referendum, because, unlike the first one, people are now fully aware of the disaster this was, and many realize it's only the beginning of an even larger one.",True,False,False,,0,1554107519,,False,0,{},ejv25lt,False,t3_b7m4gl,False,True,t1_ejspn3w,/r/brexit/comments/b7m4gl/6_million/ejv25lt/,False,,1557214751,2,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,0.0,

It is astonishing how irrational remainers are prepared to be.  And to frame it as a watertight argument too.  It really goes to show what lengths you guys will go to.

This post referendum gish gallop has got to end.  

Sure.  Let's have a GE, let's vote on how to leave.  But be honest, the remainers aren't interested in that, you just want to suppress brexit.

Guys, even if you get away with it, it won't go away.  It's going to happen.

Our country is not interested enough in the EU.  35% turn out in the 2014 election, and 27% of them voted for ukip allowing them to represent us!  We don't want the Euro, we don't want them to set our taxes, we are only in it because we got to have our cake and eat it.  Don't pretend now that we love it.  

Most remainers voted remain as it was the default, psychology has well established we go for the default when faced with difficult choices (damn those experts!).  It was never because we admire the EU.

People are getting jumpy now because of fear of change.  One thing we also know is how bad we are at predictions and how we tend to see things being much worse than they are.  

Stop pretending we love the EU.  Accept that the majority want to leave.

This was a democratic decision and if you can't accept it then recognise your role in creating an unstable future for the UK.  This was not the doing of the leave voter. Democracy requires the consent of the loser and your failure to provide this is the problem.  

We have a right to decide the future of our country and a right to see our voted enacted.

Shame on you.

And god please for the love of God people stop claiming a second vote will ""resolve the issue"", it changes nothing when Leave or the Tories win again as I suspect both will - little has changed, get out of your bubbles.

Healslutting isn't bound strictly to games with Healing. The 'healslut mindset' is simply a 'submissive mindset/headspace' (or 'subspace' if your 'nasty) and can take shape in any game at all so long as you can communicate and work with a team. Maybe your game of choice doesn't have healing, but maybe they have Trading and a Carrying Capacity issue?

My wife and I picked up (...I know, I know...) Fallout 76, preorder and all. And once we learned the ropes, my beloved little healslut was made into my perfect little storageslut (since carrying capacity and storage capacity was sooooo pathetically small in the beginning!). I'd have her carry around my unnecessary equipment, send her to investigate areas, trade me legendary gear she found that would suit me and of course toy with her and punish her when she messed up, couldn't revive me, died etc. Once we learned that there was a way to heal-others (other than just reviving teammates) my 'encouragements' became more insistent as we leveled together and she specced out her healslut character to actually do some healing and be worth keeping around.

Now don't get me wrong, she has a secondary character for when we're just building stuff and having a general-gaming time, where there are no such rules or expectations put on her and we're literally just two nerds playing games together. But she does play her level 94 healslut character far more (at least when we played) then she does her 40-something 'Main' character.

Also keep in mind that the 'submissive mindset' can apply to other gaming-roles as well. DPSslut? Yup. Tankslut? That too, tons of them in Overwatch. There's also a subset of the submissive mindset we call 'brats' here. Submissives who prefer to be cheeky to their Doms and overtly encourage them to punish them by being- well, brats. Combine all the terms to create a 'label' for what kind of role you like to fill.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as for 'Sex-binded', I'm not sure if you mean 'Women are Healsluts, Men are the Doms', but the answer to that one is No. A giant solid-gold No. Men can be healsluts and women can be Doms all the same. Or they can be Switches as well.

If you mean 'Does healslutting always involve sex?' then the answer to that is No as well. Just like the BDSM culture in which this community is immersed in, BDSM sometimes (or in many cases often-times) doesn't involve sex at all. The fulfillment is from *Serving* and growing, having fun and getting enjoyment from what you're doing. But for MANY, sex is intrinsically tied to BDSM and thus healslutting. If you want there to be no sex, then there will be plenty of partners or groups out there who will welcome that. If you want there to always be sex (or at least lewd contexts/content), there's people out there for that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Healslutting is no one hard-coded thing. Just like BDSM that it comes from it is incredibly varied and nuanced. Communicate with your partners, learn about your own tastes, and find other like-minded people to play with and enjoy healslutting however you want. Just always be respectful, consenting and communicative. Safewords and all the things that go into a BDSM style environment are critical to making sure you and those you play with have an enjoyable time.",True,False,False,,0,1554112701,,False,0,{},ejv4wvy,False,t3_b7zvlh,False,True,t3_b7zvlh,/r/HealSluts/comments/b7zvlh/question_about_the_concept_of_healslutting/ejv4wvy/,False,,1557216040,3,True,False,HealSluts,t5_3fhmj,r/HealSluts,public,0.0,

I'm not sure where in Germany you'd be, but I'm enlisted at Ramstein so for what it's worth.

Everyone always hypes Germany, so much that I tried for 17 years to get here. Now that i'm here, I absolutely hate it and can't wait to move back to the States.

Germany is nice in postcards; none of those postcard photos are taken in the Kaiserslautern area, I can tell you that. It's often described among my coworkers as ""the West Virginia of Germany."" There's lots of great travel options in this area, but all of them are AT LEAST an hour's drive. IMO, this area sucks. Most of the restaurants are the same shitty ethnic places you find outside any base in the States; shitty Thai, shitty sushi, TONS of shitty Italian, etc.

Germany is nice to visit, and have a few pretzels and brats, German beers, etc. But actually living here is a real chore. Their housing, utilities, traffic/parking, and laws seem really archaic after growing up in the States. If you find a landlord who speaks English at all, you're super lucky. NOTHING is open on Sunday but some restaurants and stuff like parks &amp; museums etc, it's supposed to be your family day. As an example, you aren't allowed to mow your lawn on Sunday, because it would be a loud disturbance to your neighbors. If you don't already have what you need by Sunday, that's just poor planning on your part, or you go on base. So of course the BX and commissary are utterly slammed on Sunday, so hopefully you don't have a sick kid who needs medicine, or you forgot something for dinner...

Also you can plan on at least 3-4 weeks for them to setup your utilities like internet, unless you speak fluent German. On that note, we've experienced anti-American attitude several times; people always say that they're nicer if you make a valid attempt to speak German, but that hasn't really been our experience. IMO the genuinely nice Germans who welcome our business are really few and far between.

""Oh man, I can't wait to drive on the Autobahn!"" Yeah, except it drops to 80 km/h speed limit past many exits, long segments of every road are under construction forever, and supposedly the Germans are more respectful drivers but particularly the A6 near Ramstein has significantly more accidents and traffic jams than I ever witnessed on I-95 going into D.C. Speaking of construction, the Germans seem to start thousands of road construction projects and almost never finish them. I believe the A6 construction just finished after 10? 15 years? Most of the time you get a road blocked off with no-one actively working on it.

Then there's the Polizei. To put it shortly, we've witnessed domestic violence twice (a German man beating his wife, once in the car behind us, and once at a drunken rager next door) and reported it, they refused to even take details because they had no intention of investigating it; it's basically not their problem. 

Some other random things, Germans have no concept of personal space; they see nothing wrong with just walking up and touching your kids. They are WAY too trusting; I get miffed at the simple fact they will not deliver my mail unless my name is plastered on the door. But that's not all, if I'm not home they will give my packages to my neighbor, because of course he's trustworthy enough to make sure I get them. As someone with a security background this drives me up the wall, especially when there's enough crime in the area that targets Americans. Just last week, three brand new vehicles were stolen from my village, and vehicle break-ins in the K-town and surrounding area are fairly common according to SecFo.

With all that said, if you have money saved up, your kids are decent travelers, and you can find a pet-sitter you trust, there's not much of a better base of operations from which to travel Europe. I always say, the best thing to do in Germany is to visit Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria... etc. We do all our grocery shopping 45 minutes away in France, and the quality of produce is mind blowing compared to anywhere else I've been. German bakeries are arguably unmatched, I'll give them that.

This kind of rambled all over the place, so my apologies. It's not all bad, but my experience has been mostly bad. I didn't really touch on anything mission-related, but to say this assignment has hurt my career would be an understatement, but of course that's unit dependent.

As far as taxis go sofia has 2 generally reputble companies and they are OK supertrans and Yellow taxi. I'd choose yellow over Ok as they have nicer cars in general and they don't have knockoffs. Ok are plagued by many people driving cars with similar brand names and telephone numbers on them so beware. The number for Yellow is 0291119 and the number for OK is 029732121. You can also download the yellow app of the taxi me app. Standard rates are about 79 stotinki per kilometer during the day and 89 during the night in Sofia and go up to about 1,30 per km in some other cities. I don't think that traveling between cities by taxi is a good idea as it will cost a fortune. People are right about the trains being fishy, although they are cheap as hell. The issue with them is the people you meet there and the general hygiene of the trains. It's bad. If you ask me I'd recommend catching a bus, as they are nicer, although I can't give you any advice on finding reputable bus companies. One pro tip for taxis is to keep an eye on the meter regularly as many drivers even in legitimate companies like to ""pump up"" the price of the trip with a hidden button in their car. If you see any of that going on, don't confront them and just ask them to pull over, pay and find yourself another cab. As far as bars in sofia go I'd say go check out 65 svetulki bar, and Bar Friday. Both serve ok drinks and Bar Friday especially is usually full of foreigners. As mentioned before Raketa Rakia Bar is also an excellent place. As far as rakia goes I'd say that prune rakia is more of a serbian specialty than a bulgarian one (might get lynched for this) so if you want a properly authentic bulgarian experience go for grape. (Then again why not both?) As far as city choices go you've done good by leaving more time to Plovdiv it is a much nicer city to walk around in than Sofia, but I can give no advice on it. While you are here keep in mind that European parliamentary elections are coming up and access to alcohol on the day before the elections is severely restricted, as well as the fact that high school kids are graduating around those dates so you will probably witness their flashiness and stupidity as they ride around drunk as hell in expensive cars around the city beeping their horns as loudly as possible.

Up until 1990 many western countries did not recognise soviets as the De Jure rulers over the Baltics. Some did not even recognise De Facto rule. One of the biggest superpowers at the time - USA - also did not recognise soviets as the legitimate rulers of Baltic states. [[Source]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_continuity_of_the_Baltic_states). DPKR is probably the only country in the world that says they should legally govern Korean Peninsula. Same goes for Taiwan which says that whole China belongs to them. There is quite a bit of difference here.

&gt; What are you trying to argue? That partisans fought the Soviets in that time?

If you read the ECHR protocol, you would know by now, that Freedom Fighters defended theirselves, their culture and their country from soviet invaders. Also, you are trying to defend an officially recognised genocide. That is probably illegal in most EU countries, so were I you, I would definitely watch my tongue as you are breaking the law just by writing these comments.

&gt; I'd also be interested to know how many of these ""freedom fighters"" had ties to the Nazis

LTDF was a unit created to fight against the soviets. It consisted mostly of volunteers and the main goal of this unit was to restore independence, not to collaborate with nazies. That is the main reason it was short lived and quickly got disbanded. Also, why would nazies put LTDF leaders in concentration camps? 

Lithuania is slowly but very surely debunking the myth that Lithuanians were responsible for the Holocaust in Lithuania. Not that long ago, another National Hero - Jonas Noreika, also known as Generolas Vėtra - was freed from charges of collaboration with nazies. [Source](http://www.propatria.lt/2019/03/lggrtc-jonas-noreika-generolas-vetra-su.html?m=1) is sadly in Lithuanian, however, you should not expect this to be world wide news. You can also check wikipedia page which still states that he was a nazi collaborator.

There are many more examples like this.

Also I’d like to add, that Lithuanians never formed an SS division, despite being the largest Baltic state. Simply there were not enough conscripts that wanted to be part of nazi atrocities. Many of whom refused to join SS divisions were either put in concentration camps or went to the forests.

So to cut a long story short, you are trying to teach me my history and deny officially recognised genocide. Nice try though.

&gt;He is God!

 &gt;O ye sons and daughters of the [Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith): 

 &gt;DAY and night I have no other occupation than the remembrance of the friends, praying from the depth of my heart in their behalf, begging for them confirmation from the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith) and supplicating the direct effect of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. I am hopeful from the favors of His Highness the Lord of Bestowals, that the friends of God during such a time may become the secret cause of the illumination of the hearts of humanity, breathing the breath of life upon the spirits—whose praiseworthy results may become conducive to the glory and exaltation of humankind throughout all eternity. Although in some of the **Western States, like California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, the fragrances of holiness are diffused, numerous souls have taken a share and a portion from the fountain of everlasting life, they have obtained heavenly benediction, have drunk an overflowing cup from the wine of the love of God and have hearkened to the melody of the Supreme Concourse—yet in the states of New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada, the lamp of the love of God is not ignited in a befitting and behooving manner, and the call of the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith) has not been raised.** Now, if it is possible, show ye an effort in this direction. Either travel yourselves, personally, throughout those states or choose others and send them, so that they may teach the souls. For the present those states are like unto dead bodies: they must breathe into them the breath of life and bestow upon them a heavenly spirit. Like unto the stars they must shine in that horizon and thus the rays of the Sun of Reality may also illumine those states. 


&gt;God says in the great Qur’án: “Verily God is the helper of those who have believed. He will lead them from darkness into light.” 1 This means: God loves the believers, consequently He will deliver them from darkness and bring them into the world of light. 

&gt;It is also recorded in the blessed Gospel: Travel ye throughout the world and call ye the people to the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith). 2 Now this is the time that you may arise and perform this most great service and become the cause of the guidance of innumerable souls. Thus through this superhuman service the rays of peace and conciliation may illumine and enlighten all the regions and the world of humanity may find peace and composure. 


 &gt;During my stay in America I cried out in every meeting and summoned the people to the propagation of the ideals of universal peace. I said plainly that the continent of Europe had become like unto an arsenal and its conflagration was dependent upon one spark, and that in the coming years, or within two years, all that which is recorded in the Revelation of John and the Book of Daniel would become fulfilled and come to pass. This matter, in all probability, was published in the [San Francisco Bulletin, October 12, 1912](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/75w2n9/october_12_on_this_date_in_1912_an_article_in_the/). You may refer to it, so that the truth may become clear and manifest; thus ye may fully realize that this is the time for the diffusion of the fragrances. 


 &gt;The magnanimity of man must be heavenly or, in other words, it must be assisted by the divine confirmation, so that he may become the cause of the illumination of the world of humanity. 


 &gt;Upon you be greeting and praise!

And suddenly, they come across an AF, who is probably more petite, has been so heavily brainwashed to believe any WM paying attention to her is like a gift from heaven (so the chances of the WM fearing he'll be turned down are almost none), and who could very well be not as strongly opinionated as we are the West.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to AF about this 'AF are more subservient' stereotype, and they actually did agree that they could be more into cooking and household etc than Western women. However, they also insist that AM are even more expecting/demanding this kind of subservient behavior compared to WM, who, according to them are much more positive towards feminism. idk, all this seems truly strange to me, because I can't believe that we're still having such discussions, about women and household etc, in the 21st century and with all this globalization.

&amp;#x200B;

But, again, I truly hope we'll see these stats e.g. in 2020, because I BET, things will start changing so much for AM. And you really do have BTS to thank for that.

ETA: If you don't believe me about WMAF consisting mainly of extremely insecure men just look at how many WM celebrities date/marry AF. Not many, no? Compare that to the number of WM celebrities who are into e.g. Latinas or BM celebrities who are into WF. That's quite an indication, imo.

You said no cheddar was orange or yellowish orange. You called it fake American cheese. Aged cheddar is yellowish orange. The longer it ages the more the color darkens. It is not white/pale cream as you describe it. It starts that way, and as it ages changes colors. There is a scientific explanation behind this which you can find here:  https://www.thekitchn.com/all-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-cheese-colors-explained-the-cheesemonger-166329a
But the relevant part I will put in front of you ""cheese that’s left to age will deepen in color, so a cheese that’s ripened for 9 months will be significantly more intense color-wise than a fresh cheese."" 

You said you bought cheese at a gas station, I asked for evidence because in the previous sentence I provided evidence for my claim. That's how an argument works. I'm not sure what you are used to but this is how normal conversations are had. 

To your other point (which to be fair I am being generous in calling it a point), the world wars thing was a joke. Just like the gas station thing, just like the kids getting shot thing. You clearly have a hard time recognising humor. And if you would like I will provide an epistemological breakdown of where the humor in my statements comes from. Of course by doing this, it will remove the humor from those statements. That's how jokes work, when you have to explain them they stop being funny. For example: I made a joke comparing the banning memes to lack of any sort of banning of guns in America. Its funny because Europe banned something to solve a problem that doesn't exist, while America won't ban anything even though the problem is an all to common tragedy. Its called self deprecating humor. I'm making fun of america. 
 The brother thing I understand because I took it for granted that you knew who hulk hogan was. Cultural differences and what not.

I am in no means an expert on cheese or comedy, but what my interaction has led me to believe is that I am more knowledgable about it than you. This will be the end of my serious posts, from here on out they will be stuffed with cheese puns (see what I did there? I'm trying to make it easy for you to spot the joke) and other jokes probably about Europe.

A good starting point for a barbell would be to consider Rogue's EU Oly Bar, or the Pyrros bar.

If you do see used bars in your market on places like facebook and craigslist, look for anything Rogue, Eleiko, Werksan, Uesaka.

You haven't given a whole lot to start on as far as what brands of barbell you were looking at for $200.

However, I don’t think respect should be institutionalized. Hate speech laws in many european countries is categorized as “any speech that offends the receiver”. That is a very slippery slope, and this could very easily politicized. When something can be taken advantage of, it will be. When it comes to shutting down opposition, “hate speech”, simply accusing them of being racist or sexist can do the job. I don’t worry about “finally being called out for my inherent bigotry”, but the fact that as sensible as I may speak, it may still offend someone, or god forbid a marginalized group: something being offensive or not is entirely defined by them after all. And for those who actually hate someone by their skin colour or gender, here is something about free society: even a Nazi is entitled to his/her opinion. As long as they don’t violate the rights of others.

Freedom of expression is one of the things HK holds dear, and is consistently undermined by the regressive left in the west. Chick fil-a isn’t allowed to open a branch in the airport of Buffalo NY because its CEO opposes same-sex marriage. If HK starts passing legislation regarding “hate” speech as defined by the government, it may just be the perfect chance for the PRC to step in. 

Of course, racial discrimination is a thing of its own in Asia, and is an issue which should be addressed. However, I would argue the general attitude of the population matters more than some institutionalized rule, law or not, which prohibits certain speech. This would just raise tension. Education could be a better starting point, nationalism in Asia would be compared to Nazi era standards in some places.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst your idea is admirable I would argue the fact that each turns represent 3 months is more than enough time to take into account orders being created in the UK, them being dispatched by rider, the six week journey to the colonies and being delivered to their General. You could maybe make a plan and implement it the turn after to simulate it but I feel it's already in the game and implementing plans does usually tend to happen (for me personally) the turn after they are thought up.

My own personal rule is to never own land on mainland Europe as GB, unless its of strategic importance to the balance of power. For example I had whittled down the French to holding only France and Corsica, I took Corsica and gave it to the 13 colonies (as a base to start expansion/trade in Europe), I then took Paris and immediately gave it to the Dutch. This meant that my main ally was dominant and occupied in Europe so I could conquered the rest of the world without having to worry about pissing of the Dutch. I did however later in the campaign get given Hannover as part of a peace deal with denmark (I only naval blockade them), and seeing as though Prussia was the main rival to the Dutch and they were both pretty powerful I kept the province and parked an army full of elite units in there so I can better manage and have direct input on the building tensions in Europe.

""Latino"" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word latinoamericano (Latin American in English) or the Portuguesephrase latino americano, thus excluding speakers of Spanish or Portuguese from Europe.[6] Both Hispanic and Latino are generally used to denote people living in the United States,[7][8] so much so that ""Outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Colombians, Peruvians, and so forth.""[9][10] In Latin America, the term latino is not a common endonym and its usage in Spanish as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States.
The U.S. government's Office of Management and Budget has defined Hispanic or Latinopeople as being those who ""trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central, and South America(other than Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname), and other Spanish cultures"".[11]The United States Census uses the ethnonymHispanic or Latino to refer to ""a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race"".[12] The Census Bureau also explains that ""[o]rigin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.""[13] Hence the U.S. Census and the OMB are using the terms differently. The U.S. Census and the OMB use the terms interchangeably, where both terms are synonyms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the term Hispanic or Latino.[14]
The AP Stylebook's recommended usage of Latino in Latin America includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons ""from – or whose ancestors were from – ... Latin America, including Brazilians"". However, in the recent past, the term Latinos was also applied to people from the Caribbean region,[15] but those from former Dutch and British colonies are excluded.[16]

[Ali-Kuli Khan](http://bahaistories.blogspot.com/2010/11/ali-kuli-khan-becomes-one-of-abdul.html) (also known as Nabílu'd-Dawlih) was an eminent Iranian Baha'i who served briefly as 'Abdu'l-Baha’s English-language secretary between 1899 and 1901, he was subsequently sent to America where he was the first to translate into English some of the most important works of Baha’u’llah, such as the *[Kitab-i-Iqan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-%C3%8Dq%C3%A1n)*, *[The Seven Valleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Valleys)* and *[the Glad-Tidings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablets_of_Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h_Revealed_After_the_Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas)*. He also continued to translate 'Abdu'l-Baha’s correspondence with the American Baha'is. Ali Kuli Khan was appointed Iranian *chargés d'affaires* in Washington in 1910 and later served in various high-ranking diplomatic positions. He married Boston socialite Florence Breed and was the father of [Marzieh Gail](https://bahaikipedia.org/Marzieh_Gail).




From the [Encyclopaedia Iranica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Iranica) article titled [Gail, Marzieh](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gail-marzieh)...

GAIL, MARZIEH (b. near Boston, Mass., 1 April 1908; d. San Francisco, 16 October 1993;  Figure 1), Persian-American Bahaʾi author, essayist, and translator.  She was the second child of ʿAliqoli (Ali-Kuli) Khan Nabil-al-Dawla, the Iranian consul in Washington, and Florence Breed of Boston; their marriage was the first Persian-American marital union in the Bahaʾi community.  ʿAliqoli Khan was from Kashan; his father met the Bab in 1845 and became a Babi and later a Bahaʾi (Gail, 1987, p. 6).  Florence Breed became a Bahaʾi through her husband.  In 1912, at the age of four, Marzieh met ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, then head of the Bahaʾi Faith, during his journey to the West.  He is said to have remarked that the child had āteš (fire) and  namak (salt; Gail, 1991, p. 87).   She grew up “half Eastern and half Western, neither this nor that and yet both” (Gail, 1991, p. 273).

Marzieh’s education was conducted by a series of private tutors, since her father's diplomatic work meant that the family had to move frequently, living in Washington, D.C., Paris, Tehran, Istanbul, and Tbilisi.  While living in Iran as a child, she observed at close range court life in the waning years of the Qajar era, although she avoided events where she would have to go veiled, which she disliked.   Her family were often guests at the opulent royal residences including the Kāḵ-e Ṣāḥebqarāniya, where, as a child, she once had a comic debate with the young Aḥmad Shah (r. 1909-24; Gail, 1991, p.136). When she was fifteen, her parents received a marriage proposal for her from the shah himself.  Her parents declined, because they were determined to see their daughter educated.  She later wrote that they thus saved her from “that quicksand” (Gail, 1991, p. 246).  Her father, who had been appointed minister of the court of Crown Prince Moḥammad-Ḥasan Mirzā (Gail, 1991, pp. 254-55), frequently received death threats; the family was denounced by the clerics from the pulpit of the mosques for being “Babis” and because the daughters were known to appear in public unveiled.  The family felt, however, that the attacks were instigated by foreign sources seeking to block his efforts at economic development and fiscal reform (Gail, 1991, p. 254).

In 1924 the family returned to the United States.  Marzieh began her studies at Vassar College and graduated from Stanford University in 1929.  Shortly afterwards, she married Howard Carpenter, a medical student at the same university.  In 1932, she received a master’s degree in English from the University of California at Berkeley.

Marzieh had first met Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (Šawqi Effendi Rabbāni) in France in 1920, just before he became head of the Bahaʾi Faith.  She was devoted to him, writing that the moments she spent in his presence were “the only really important times of [her] life except for the moments with ʿAbdu’l-Bahá” (Gail, 1991, p. 301).  For his part, Shoghi Effendi greatly valued and constantly encouraged her.  In 1933, at Shoghi Effendi’s request, Marzieh and Howard went to live in Iran, and Marzieh was hired as the first female reporter to serve on the staff of a Tehran newspaper (Chen, p. 137); but when Howard contracted poliomyelitis and became paralyzed, they returned to the United States, where he died.  In 1939, she married Harold Gail, a manufacturer of springs, and in 1954 the two went to live in Europe as Bahaʾi pioneers, helping to establish Bahaʾi religion first in France and later in Austria and the Netherlands. 

Marzieh Gail’s literary career began with essays she wrote for the Bahaʾi magazine Star of the West when she was a student at Stanford University.  In 1951 she published Persia and the Victorians, followed by several works on Bahaʾi subjects and three books (including one for young readers) about fourteenth-century Europe.  She also published newspaper articles under the pen name V. Ives.  She was known for her irrepressible sense of humor, which permeated her writing.  A reviewer of The Three Popes found it “disconcerting” that she treated “the record of human experience as something of a comic opera provided for the delectation of posterity” (Kirkus Reviews, p. 543).

While in Iran in the 1930s, she began to translate Bahaʾi scriptures into English. Shoghi Effendi commissioned her to translate the “Questions and Answers” appendix to Bahāʾ-Allāh’s Ketāb-e aqdas and then the text of the book itself, which she worked on in collaboration with Bahaʾi scholar Mirzā Asad-Allāh Fāżel Māzandarāni.  Later she published a translation of Bahāʾ-Allāh’s Haft wādi and Čahār wādi, followed by translations of ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ’s treatise on modernization and reform, Resāla-ye madaniya, and his Taḏkerat al-wafāʾ.  She contributed translations to the volume Selections from the Writings of ʿAbdu’l-Bahá and also translated the memoir Zendagi-e Ostād Moḥammad-ʿAli Salmāni.

Marzieh Gail and her husband returned to the United States in 1964 and lived in Keene, New Hampshire.  Her later years were devoted to writing a series of biographical and autobiographical works.  Her husband did the household chores so she would be free to write (Chen, p. 138).  In 1981 they moved to San Francisco, where she died in 1993.

Buckle up, Here we go 1.) I would suggest you take a look at “How rich am I”  https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/  This website was made from a Labour Party left wing UK think tank, using global poverty statistics to show you every single person in the United States actually is in the top 3% of the world, rather we are not alone in this 3% but many of our EU friends are with us in the 3%, nevertheless by global standards everyone is elitist here. 50% of the world doesn’t eat every day, and 33% live off of the equivalent of $15 a day or less. Our poor enjoy toilets, running water, individual car ownership.  This suggest even our poorest are still world elite status as you would like to put it. I’m honestly puzzled why you mentioned “global income inequality” as if the United States isn’t doing enough to combat “global income equality” by outsourcing millions of manufacturing jobs to China and India, bolstering their middle class. I have a friend in India, whom makes a decent living making H&amp;M clothing. 


The fact of the matter is that we have the largest economy in the world for our poor, an economy where products and services compete with each other for the cheapest products. Many things from squatters rights, entitlements and abundance of food shelters enables even our poorest to enjoy a standard of living above those in poverty in Brazil, demonstrated by world poverty statistics.



Next point 2.) I never made an argument for “Trickle down economics” I don’t advocate tax breaks for the rich. I would re-read my statement. I simply said the United States has the biggest income mobility in the world, the fact of the matter is that nobody is OCCUPYING the top 5% of America or the top 10% but rather it is constantly fluctuating, for instance I made $60,000 two years ago, putting me in the top 30%.....this year I had medical issues and I’ll only be bringing in around $40,000, and I’ll be in the 50% ... My father wrote a book and published it, making $200,000 a few years back, putting him in the top 1%. Growing up we lived an average life. We fluctuated all over the place. I simply suggested that as people move up in the income brackets, they absolutely create the products and services we enjoy; Jeff Bezoz from Amazon just created another plant in Austin Texas starting at $15/hour.  


3.) For your knowledge, I actually support a higher tax on higher earnings, but that doesn’t negate my view of income equality being a college professor pseudo talking point for a socialist utopia that doesn’t exist. People getting richer from our economy, does not inherently make people poorer ; My father writing his book and joining the 1% for example.  Africa, no matter what semantics you might employ, has tremendous income equality no matter how you slice it, income equality alone doesn’t mean anything.

Also because of investment there will always be those getting much richer, the principle of investment demands that money accrue interest over time, I would suggest we focus more on lifting people out of poverty and less fixating on the success of others.

Até então, não sabia de quem havia apanhado, mas descobriria rapidamente. Quando Ustra o deixou, Diogo perguntou a outro guarda que estava por perto. “Onde é que eu tô?” “Aqui é a antessala do inferno”, avisou o agente, de modo sarcástico, antes de mandá-lo sentar numa *cadeira de dragão*. Nu, colocaram eletrodos nas suas genitálias, boca, ouvidos, e com choques elétricos ordenavam suas confissões para entregar companheiros.

 Depois das torturas diárias que o aguardavam durante os meses que ficou na prisão, Diogo viria a concluir que Ustra era o líder demoníaco daquele inferno. O comandante, homenageado neste domingo por [Jair Bolsonaro para dar o “sim” ao impeachment da presidenta Dilma](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/04/19/politica/1461019293_721277.html), foi chefe de um centro de sequestro, tortura e morte na ditadura militar (1964-1985), conhecido oficialmente por DOI-CODI, que funcionou no bairro da Vila Mariana, em São Paulo.

 Apelidado de *Casa da Vovó* entre seus comandados, o Destacamento de Operações de Informações e Centro de Operações de Defesas Internas tinha em [Ustra](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/carlos_alberto_brilhante_ustra/a/) o cérebro da repressão quando a Governo militar resolveu endurecer com integrantes dos movimentos que resistiam à ditadura nos anos 70. Em geral, jovens universitários que acreditavam na utopia de poder combater um Estado militar para restabelecer a democracia, usurpada em 1964 pelo golpe. Diogo era um deles. Integrava a Ação Libertadora Nacional, de inspiração socialista, o que no meio de uma Guerra Fria, significava ser classificado como terrorista.

 A sigla DOI-CODI, assim como o sobrenome Ustra, têm um efeito cáustico nos ouvidos das vítimas da sua tortura e das famílias que perderam de maneira cruel seus pais, mães, filhos ou simplesmente amigos. Pelo menos 50 pessoas morreram enquanto Ustra comandou o DOI (1970-1973), e há registro de mais de 300 pessoas torturadas sob suas ordens.

 Quem saiu vivo, ou foi mutilado ou saiu com uma cicatriz eterna pela sádica violência aplicada sob comando de Ustra. Diogo, hoje geólogo, e presidente da [Comissão da Verdade, em São Paulo](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2014/12/10/politica/1418237519_479087.html), foi um dos poucos a ser torturado diretamente por Ustra, que na maior parte do tempo, se dedicava à inteligência dos processos de tortura. Dava ordens, mapeava os movimentos de militantes, estabelecia as táticas para que sua equipe pudesse capturá-los e chegar aos líderes. “A especialidade deles era violentar e torturar mulheres”, lembra Diogo, que presenciou inúmeras violações enquanto esteve ali, inclusive a tortura de sua mulher à época. Grávida e nua, passou por choques elétricos na sua frente. O bebê que carregava não resistiu. Arlete sofreu hemorragias e não pôde recorrer a apoio médico.

 ### **Crianças na sala de tortura**

 Amélia Teles, ou Amelinha, também caiu nas garras de Ustra. Foi presa junto com o marido Cesar, e o amigo Carlos Danielli. Viveram todo o roteiro do inferno no DOI CODI, conforme conta [num vídeo disponível no Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFqm0OcJDDk). Militantes do PCdoB, sentiram bem mais que surras e choques elétricos. O casal de jovens de pouco mais de 20 anos, foi preso em dezembro de 1972, e apanhou seguidamente sem ter noção do tempo. Certo dia, Amelinha estava nua, sentada na cadeira de dragão, urinada e vomitada, quando viu entrar na sala de tortura seus dois filhos, Janaína de 5 anos, e Edson, 4. Ustra havia mandado buscar as duas crianças porque queria que eles testemunhassem de seus pais. “Mamãe, por que você está azul e a papai verde?”, perguntou sua filha, enquanto queria abraçar a mãe, paralisada de dor e pelos fios elétricos. A cor era fruto das torturas que desfiguraram sua tez.

 As duas crianças foram levadas para a casa de um militar enquanto os pais continuaram apanhando nas mãos de agentes da ditadura comandados por Ustra. Os arquivos da ditadura mostram crianças de colo fichadas como filhos de terroristas. “Vamos matar seus filhos, menos comunistas vivos”, ouviam seus pais enquanto eram torturados. Amelinha foi espancada por Ustra enquanto ouvia: “sua terrorista!”. Viu a morte do amigo Carlos enquanto estava presa. Seu marido Cesar faleceu no ano passado.

 ### Mortos

 Diogo e a família Teles conseguiram sobreviver àqueles anos para contar os horrores que aconteciam durante a ditadura brasileira. Mas muitos não tiveram essa sorte. O jornalista Vladimir Herzog, que em 1975 era diretor da TV Cultura, foi assassinado no interior do prédio do DOI-CODI, depois de ter sido intimado a prestar depoimentos por supostas ligações com o Partido Comunista. No Instituto Vladimir Herzog é possível ler o que se passou no final de outubro de 1975, depois que Vlado, como era conhecido, se apresentou para depor. Encapuzado, foi sufocado com amoníaco e submetido a seguidas sessões de tortura.

 “Naquela cela solitária, com o ouvido na janelinha, eu podia ouvir os gritos: ‘Quem são os jornalistas? Quem são os jornalistas?’ Pelo tipo de grito, pelo tipo de porrada, sabia que estava sendo feito com alguém exatamente aquilo pelo que eu tinha passado"", recordaria anos depois o jornalista Sérgio Gomes, que estava preso no mesmo local em que Vlado se encontrava. “Lá pela hora do almoço há uma azáfama, uma correria. Ele foi torturado durante toda a manhã e se dá o tal silêncio. A pessoa para de ser torturada e em seguida há uma azáfama, uma correria… A gente percebe que tem alguma coisa estranha acontecendo. Tinham acabado de matar o Vlado.”

 No livro *A Casa da Vovó*, o jornalista Marcelo Godoy faz um minucioso relato sobre o DOI-CODI a partir de relatos de ex-agentes que trabalharam com Ustra. Levou dez anos para concluir a obra (2004 a 2014), e viu o antigo comandante tentar interferir em sua apuração em alguns momentos. O velho torturador ligou para seus ex-subalternos pedindo silêncio. Muitos, no entanto, contrariaram a ordem do antigo chefe. Um deles relatou a Godoy: “Você não tem ideia do que é passar uma noite inteira vendo um homem e sabendo que no dia seguinte ele vai morrer... Todos nós carregamos um fantasma que te acompanha a vida inteira. Esse é o meu.”

 Ustra contava com o apoio silencioso dos presidentes militares que mantinham um discurso de que torturas eram casos pontuais. Em 2008, a Justiça o reconheceu como torturador e, em 2012, condená-lo em primeira instância pela morte de apenas uma vítima, Luiz Eduardo da Rocha Merlino, morto em 19 de julho de 1971. “Nunca cometi torturas”, disse ele em depoimento à Comissão Nacional da Verdade em 2013. No ano seguinte, foi declarado um dos [377 agentes da repressão](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2014/12/10/politica/1418212909_598291.html) pela Comissão. Ustra morreu em julho de 2015 de câncer.

Initially I didn't. Till I read that Merkel forbade the EU from coming to terms with the UK on side issues like migrants rights because she thought that waiting till we were in recession would be better:

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-theresa-may-pre-brexit-expats-plan-nixed-by-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-negotiations-european-union-residence/

&gt;The Germans argue it makes more sense for the EU to keep the trade-off on British expatriates' rights up its sleeve as a sweetener during the most painful phase of the negotiations, likely to occur in 2018. It was naïve for the British to expect the issue could be taken out of the overall context. **By then, Britain could be gripped by a Brexit-induced slowdown, with foreign financial firms moving jobs from the City to the eurozone and inflation due to the pound's slide eating into living standards.**

It didn't work out that way. The UK continued to grow, movement from the City turned out to be negligible and it's Germany that is in trouble.

I'm hoping that Germany suffers a really really severe recession - that should teach them a nice sharp lesson about playing games. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

You can say that the black population was systematically disadvantaged/held back and the white population was just getting normal treatment (free school, healthcare, good policing etc.), or that the black population that was 90% of people in the country was being treated in the standard way that the government treated people South African and the whites were living a life of privilege where they got *outlandish luxuries* like free schooling and free healthcare and good policing.

What if they want to kill you so no witnesses?  
  
What if you walk down the stairs with a rifle in hand, there are 4 guys and you run out of 10 rounds?  
  

&gt;
&gt;You did inadvertently make a great argument for the law in the case of mass shootings, hard changing mags if there are dozens of people around you that can attack you.
  
Ah, another grabber shows up under a gun post... good job INTENTIONALLY MISREADING MY COMMENT AND PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH.  The point is, you are at home without equipment at night maybe, no reason to have gear on so you can only grab one mag that is in the gun already and either or extra mag or a flashlight or something else... you NEED more than 10 rounds just in case.  
  
Mass shooters will just wear vests with magazines in them so get the fuck out with this stupid reasoning. People don't sleep with fucking web gear on, so don't ban their magazines because you are a 350iq grabber who thinks ammo works like in video games.  
  

&gt;I understand it's a firearms sub and you probably hate all firearms laws but that is a ridiculous position to have.  
  
Actually i support proper regulations in countries where it is necessary, like EU where we have people living extremely close. And even in a lot of countries in Europe it is way too hard to get guns. I had to learn the stupid process to pass my classes in Hungary so i DO know.  
 But then comes the fact that people like you don't know how guns work so you want to pass laws that can be extended to ban more and more parts thus banning guns indirectly.  
  
&gt; Some regulation of anything is beneficial for all parties involved.  
  
OKAY... Here is what being beneficial to both sides would be: reopening the MG registry with NFA process, legalizing suppressors as part of hearing protection and stopping all attempts at magazine, ammo or cosmetic feature bans.  
  
Banning ammo is just banning guns using it but saving face publicly. Banning magazines has no reason and accomplishes nothing. Banning features just hurts gun owners.  
  
I make gun parts... do you know how ridiculously easy it is to illegally make a pistol grip for a ""compliant"" gun? Do you know how easy it is to make a full auto submachinegun? 
  
&gt;If you blindly oppose all regulation you aren't rational you're a fanatic. 
  
Good thing i am not one. My parents are one of the most accepting people in the world and they grew up under communosm. I know it very well from them and public education how tyranny works. Lies, technically true statements, misinterpretable and intentionally badly worded laws and praying on emotion were their tools. And since i have professional education regarding guns, i see all the true intentions behind all the useless laws. But hey, you know how they say... ""they came for them but i was not that, so i was left alone. Eventually they came for us and we were alone""  
  
Just because you dislike guns you should not advocate for meaningless feelgood laws.  
  
&gt;Power shouldn't be given to people who can't be responsible in its usage.  
  
The problem arises when an agency arbitrarily declare you unfit for it for having the wrong thoughts or making stupid facebook posts years ago.  
  
&gt; Common sense background checks were actually supported by the NRA and Republicans in the past and would help separate power from the irresponsible without needing to infringe on law-abiding citizens like this law.
  
***In the US you need a background check to buy guns from a store already.***
-  
  

&gt;This specific law does seem unnecessary but at least one state is trying it so we will have data to show if it's a good idea or not. Then we will know for sure if it is worth trying.  
  
Heh... Chicago has very high gun control and gun crime... strange.  
  
Australia had a declining crime rate and their gun laws had no visible effect on it. It kept lowering the same rate yearly as before the gun laws.  
  
Hungary had criminals mass killing people at a bank with machineguns... machineguns were banned... Bataclan and Charlie Hebdo were both done with unlawfully acquired illegal machineguns...  
   

&gt;We can argue hypotheticals all day but we will have to wait for the data to know for sure.
 
I just put up some examples... oh and the mass truck attacks a couple years back! Nobody had a gun to stop them..  
  
Oh oh oh! The Christchurch massacre where the second mosque was defended by a guy with a gun!  
  
Head over to r/dgu and see for yourself.  
  
You brought up some decent point so i hope my initial reaction was not too much. Your comment overall seems more intelligent than the general grabber propaganda shilling that is usually on the same level as antivaccination people or flat earthers.

[],DragonHeretic,1432675441.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqcmm,False,"In terms of what polities had these names, and at what times in history, here's a little bit of context for the origins of the terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Emperor, Duke, and Count are all terms that emerge out of the Roman Empire, and come from titles that formerly would have applied to functionaries in the roman empire. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Emperor - Imperator - was of course the ruler of the Roman Empire, but just who is an Emperor, and what is an Empire has varied throughout history. While we would apply the term ""Empire"" retroactively to expansive realms that existed before the Roman Empire, and onto realms in other Non-Roman Cultures. Ultimately, the Roman Emperor was an at least nominally elected military autocrat, and while the position was often hereditary, it was only so if one of the Emperor's sons was a fit leader.

&amp;#x200B;

The other main Emperor to appear in the Middle Ages, and help to define what it meant to be an Emperor, was the Holy Roman Emperor, and similar to his Regular Roman Counterpart, the Holy Roman Emperor was elected, but by a group of Elector Princes, and confirmed by the Pope. What both Emperors - the Basileus and the Kaiser (and eventually, the Tsar) had in common was their claims to Roman Heritage. Historians have liberally applied it outside of its European, and Roman context, but I think if we're strict, those are really the only two people who it's proper to consider Emperors, which is by no means to downplay the power of other people who get called Emperors.

&amp;#x200B;

Dukes and Counts are similarly concepts of Roman Descent, and come from the Dux, and the Comes respectively. Dux was an informal title referring to a military leader of any kind in the Roman Empire, and in later years, would become official, a sort of counterpart to a regional governor - the highest military leader in the government. In Western Europe, which we are principally talking about when we use the word Duke, this distinction collapsed among the Lombards, Franks, and others who took over after the collapse of the Roman Government, but still kept many of their traditions, and Duces, or Dukes, were often regional governors, and the realm's highest officials - they could be chosen as the King, or Emperor's generals in times of war. The Counts get their name from the Comites, the Companions of the Emperor, and are Lords subordinate to another Lord, getting their authority from him.

&amp;#x200B;

King is the only title that doesn't have a Latin Etymology, but it still comes into play in Western thought in the wake of the fall of the Western Roman Emperor. Once you had the fall of Rome, many different Germanic and Gothic nations inherited the realms once ruled by Rome, and their loyalties tended to fall along cultural lines. While it was not by any means universal, it was certainly common to have one King of Franks, or Germans, or Goths, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So what actually decides who is a Count, a Duke, a King, or an Emperor? It ultimately just comes down to about three things. If you were a subordinate Lord, what honor did your liege grant you? Or what could you get away with styling yourself as, whether you were dependent or independent? And finally, what do historians decide you were? Many people outside of Post Roman Western Europe are still styled as Kings or Emperors, for example, even those conceptions are really specifically Post Roman Western European Ideas. Count and Duke are almost never applied outside of the context of Western Europe, and it's often more accurate to talk about Lordly People from other cultures as Princes, or really, whatever is the culturally equivalent title.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, outside of a Western European, Post-Roman context, terms like Count or Duke don't have much meaning, and are rarely ever used. Kings and Emperors, while terms that are used more broadly, are still terms that apply in a primarily Post-Roman context. A lot of who was a King vs. who was an Archduke ultimately just came down to politics of the secular rulers against the Pope, and one of the only Arch-duchies was created specifically to give the Habsburgs (who created it) leverage against the Prince-Electors.

&amp;#x200B;

After previous waves of immigration, there was a cooling-off period during which borders were tightened and assimilation occurred. The most recent/present wave of immigration has been more rapid and large in absolute numbers than previous ones, and there seems to be no desire on the Dem side to enter a cooling-off period, or to even acknowledge that the current situation (large numbers of unassimilated folks) is not healthy for the society. This refusal to acknowledge or act on the issue leads Republicans to fearmonger that current immigration rates will continue forever, as there is, truly, no end in sight at present. 

We're also witnessing the worst-case scenario for our future over in Europe right now. Their multicultural experiment has been a disaster (even Merkel conceded) (see Pakistani rape gangs, terrorist attacks, increased anti-semitism &amp; homophobia, ghettos &amp; no-go zones, etc.) So the GOP looks at that as the Dems agenda for America.

Talvez ela não imagine o quanto o feminismo contribuiu para que ela, sendo mulher, pudesse usar shorts e protestar em via pública. O alvo do ódio de Isabella – que diz ser advogada mas não tem OAB – eram mulheres militantes da Democracia Corintiana, que tinham participado do ato contra o [golpe de 64](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/dictadura_brasilena) pouco antes no Vão do Masp, na mesma avenida.

          Alexandre José, manifestante pró-ditadura, estava na frente da delegacia e acabou sendo identificado pela polícia por causa desta imagem Daniel Arroyo Ponte Jornalismo   

   Isabella estava com um grupo de ativistas do Despertar Patriótico/Direita Unida, a favor da ditadura militar, e que tinha preparado um bolo para comemorar os 55 anos do início do regime que torturou e matou centenas de pessoas. No ano passado, ela foi candidata a deputada estadual pelo PRTB, mas recebeu apenas 512 votos. Isabella exibe nos braços duas tatuagens: a frase “Brasil acima de tudo” e “Brasil, ame-o ou deixe-o”, lema do regime militar, junto a uma caveira com um cap do Brasil. Com camisetas e bandeiras exaltando 1964, o Exército Brasileiro e o presidente [Jair Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro), os ativistas entraram em confronto com um grupo que vestia preto, usava adesivos “Fora, Bolsonaro” e seguia para o Parque do Ibirapuera para a Caminhada do Silêncio, em memória das vítimas da ditadura e em repúdio ao golpe militar.

 A reportagem da **Ponte**, que havia acompanhado o ato simbólico de queima do boneco do torturador confesso [coronel Brilhante Ustra](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/04/20/politica/1461180363_636737.html), em frente ao Masp, também seguia para a segunda manifestação contrária ao golpe, quando, na frente da estação Trianon-Masp da linha 3-verde do Metrô, ativistas ligados a diversos movimentos antifascistas tiraram as bexigas coladas no vidro da estação com a data: 31/3/1964. Duas mulheres, entre elas Isabella, reagiram iniciando as agressões, que foram respondidas imediatamente pelo grupo oposto. Não havia nem PM (Polícia Militar) nem GCM (Guarda Civil Metropolitana) no momento. A pancadaria rapidamente ficou generalizada. Com paus de bandeira, socos, chutes, pontapés, os grupos entraram em confronto direto. A reportagem foi atingida por gás do spray de gengibre de Isabella, que descarregava a lata indiscriminadamente no meio das pessoas.

 O fotógrafo Daniel Arroyo registrou uma sequência de golpes entre os ativistas.

            Ponte Daniel Arroyo   

   Os ativistas pró-ditadura usavam paus de bandeira para agredir os manifestantes contrários ao golpe, que não estavam armados. Uma das fotos publicadas nas redes sociais da **Ponte** permitiu que a polícia identificasse um agressor, o vigilante Alexandre José Pereira Neves – que aparece na primeira imagem da reportagem com uma barra na mão -, o colocasse no B.O. como uma das partes da ocorrência para posterior investigação. Ele vestia uma camiseta do Enéas, usava calça de estampa de camuflagem e coturnos e aparece nesta imagem agredindo um integrante da Democracia Corintiana. Ele estava misturado aos militantes pró-ditadura em frente ao DP onde a ocorrência foi registrada na noite deste domingo.

 Uma das vítimas, Marcus Santana, estava passando pelo local e ao ver o quebra-quebra, decidiu tentar ajudar a separar. Levou a pior. “Eu estava com o intuito de ajudar a acabar com aquilo. As pessoas estavam se agredindo, um absurdo, fugiu do controle totalmente. Quando eu me aproximei de um cara gordinho de camiseta cinza para perguntar o que estava acontecendo, ele levantou alguma coisa que segurava nas mãos, até agora não sei o que é, e me atacou. Tive o reflexo rápido de me defender com o braço, poderia ser pior”, contou Marcus que vestia uma camiseta contra o fascismo. “Penso que há ideias boas na direita e na esquerda. Mas [extremismo, fascismo](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/fascismo), não dá”. Marcus teve ferimentos na cabeça, no braço esquerdo e perto do tornozelo. Ele fez questão de comparecer ao 78º Distrito Policial onde a ocorrência foi registrada para depor e contar a versão dele dos fatos.

   Também esteve na delegacia o agricultor Guilherme Flach, que estava passeando na Avenida Paulista, quando também encontrou a briga e se aproximou por curiosidade. Como estava próximo do grupo antifascista, passou ser alvo de xingamentos e começou a fazer uma transmissão ao vivo do seu celular pelo Instagram. Neste momento, Isabella o ameaçou com uma taser. “Ela me deu um tapa e começou a gritar que eu tinha batido nela, que eu era agressor. Eu disse que não, ela jogou spray na minha cara. Eu vim aqui na delegacia porque quero fazer um boletim de ocorrência contra ela por calúnia e uso de arma de uso restrito”, afirmou Guilherme.

 Leandro Mohallem, bolsonarista do Juntos Pelo Brasil e que estava com o grupo pró-ditadura, foi derrubado no chão e atingido por chutes na cabeça. Sangrando, ele negou o pedido da **Ponte** de entrevistá-lo sobre as agressões que ele sofreu “A Ponte apoia essas coisas. Vocês são culpados”, disse aos berros.

 Em 2016, Leandro foi um dos organizadores de um protesto pró-Trump e aparece [neste vídeo da Ponte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHxYiKlQtw) fazendo um discurso em um inglês de difícil compreensão.

          Leandro se negou a falar com a Ponte para contar a sua versão: “Vocês defendem esse tipo de coisa” Daniel Arroyo Ponte Jornalismo   

   A GCM e a PM chegaram depois que os ânimos já estavam mais calmos. Contudo, em frente a Fiesp, um grupo de militantes do PCO (Partido da Causa Operária) tentou passar e a pancadaria recomeçou, mas foi controlada mais rapidamente. Um único manifestante ligado a movimentos antifascistas foi detido e reconhecido como um dos agressores por três militantes pró-ditadura. Dalton Henrique Araújo dos Santos foi colocado algemado na viatura da GCM enquanto levava um sermão de Davi Benedito, 57 anos. “Você acha certo isso, rapaz? Tomei três pauladas na cabeça, isso não é pra brincar, eu poderia ter morrido”, dizia o exaltado militante bolsonarista. Ao observar a nossa presença, ele assume um tom de denúncia. “Eles não vieram para brincar, vieram para arrebentar. A gente está só comemorando 64, isso é um direito. Vivemos na democracia. Eles vieram do Masp para nos arrebentar. O que eles fizeram hoje com a gente foi um crime. Nós estávamos pacificamente, vieram os militantes do PCO, jogaram spray de pimenta no meu olho”. Argumentamos que era uma militante pró-ditadura que ostentava um spray, inclusive atingindo a reportagem, mas ele argumentou que era impossível que ela o atacasse porque eram conhecidos. “Quem jogou foi um moleque que veio me dar porrada depois”, encerrou.

 Na frente da delegacia, militantes bolsonaristas e pró-ditadura se uniram e passaram a fazer ameaças ao único detido do domingo, ligado ao movimento antifascista. “A gente vai acabar com ele a hora que sair por essa porta”, disse um rapaz que vestia uma camiseta escrito Exército Brasileiro. Enquanto o delegado decidia como ia conduzir o caso, policiais militares chegaram com dois detidos. Os pró-ditadura se alvoroçaram e quando o porta-malas da viatura abriu, Isabelle, que a todo tempo fazia stories contando ter sido agredida na Avenida Paulista, fotografou a dupla e postou nas [redes sociais](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/redes_sociales) com a seguinte legenda:

 Detalhe: os dois não tinham nada a ver com a ocorrência na avenida Paulista e estavam sendo presos por outro motivo.

 Como a tentativa de assoprar velinhas para o golpe de 64 não deu certo na Avenida Paulista, os militantes pró-ditadura levaram o bolo na noite deste domingo e cantaram os parabéns em frente ao 78 DP, onde a ocorrência foi registrada. Uma das testemunhas relatou à Ponte que uma confusão aconteceu no interior da delegacia e o computador onde era registrada a ocorrência desligou perdendo grande parte dos depoimentos.

 O delegado Mauricio de Thomazi Guedes ponderou que o caso é complexo por envolver muitas versões e que precisará de diversas diligências ao longo da semana para chegar a alguma conclusão para um possível inquérito. “As partes alegam versões conflitantes que precisam ser melhor esmiuçadas e colhidas de forma serena bem como perquiridos alguns aspectos fáticos relevantes, tais como as extensões das lesões de todas as partes, a intenção dos agressores, as circunstancias que cercaram os fatos, em tempo adequado e longe das paixões despertadas no calor dos fatos”, escreveu o delegado no B.O..

 A ocorrência foi qualificada como lesão corporal de natureza grave e ameça, as vítimas estão “a esclarecer” e o delegado ouviu 5 pessoas como testemunhas e 8 pessoas – entre pró e contra ditadura – como “partes”. Dalton, o único detido, foi liberado e deverá ainda ser ouvido ao longo da semana. A taser de Isabella foi apreendida e o delegado confirmou que é uma arma, embora possivelmente de origem paraguaia, de uso restrito. “Pode matar gente cardíaca, por exemplo”, disse um investigador no corredor da delegacia.

Because taking the UK out of the EU can be done in multiple ways leading to different outcomes, a second question is needed to check which option should be pursued if (and only if) this fundamental change in the UK's international relationships is effected.

But that in itself is an arbitrary way of framing the issue. The underlying problem is ""what does in/out of the EU"" mean? When leave unexpectedly won the referendum, the first thing remainers did was to redefine ""brexit"". They suddenly started using the terms ""soft brexit"" and ""hard brexit"". Nobody had used these terms before the referendum. It was done so that ""soft brexit"" could be portrayed as the sane, sensible way of ""leaving"", while ""hard brexit"" was for ""brexit ultra extremists"". For most leavers ""brexit"" meant the same thing as ""hard brexit"". Which is why we now have a situation where 70% of the people who voted to leave the EU want no deal, because they see May's deal as brexit-in-name-only. Meanwhile, the remainers have since redefined May's deal as a ""hard brexit"".

&gt; That is the first decision the UK should make, followed by what sort of  future relationship it wants to have with the EU in the short term (even  no deal will eventually mean an agreement of some sort, but it may take  a while). 

But that doesn't work. For me, the best outcome currently on offer is no deal, followed by remaining as a full member. All flavours of ""soft brexit"" - all the compromise options which take us out of the political structure but leave us in the customs union with no control over it, and/or continue free movement (etc..) are worse than remaining.

Depois de um trágico evento, ele conhece uma cientista que promete uma alternativa ao ocorrido: uma forma de viajar para outras dimensões e refazer seus próprios passos, mas que ainda é um experimento dessa cientista. A história é bem agradável e tem alguns momentos dramáticos, e mistura bem os elementos de ficção científica e fantasia.

Além disso, ela possui uma aparência singular que a destaca dos demais. Quando ela conhece Vore, um passageiro com a aparência e odor diferente dos demais, mas parecido com a própria Tina, ela começa a suspeitar dele.

It's kind of late for the center of Europe \[C: Andorra is not in Central Europe obviously, but this is exactly what the transcript says\], but that's just how life runs here - hasteless, for example: state of war with imperialistic Germany declared during WWI was suspended only in 1957. The country was forgotten during the arrangement of the Versailles Treaty and its people might have forgotten about that as well. But there were times, when Andorra was the only terrestial route from Europe to Spain and this route was very busy: be it crusades or Napeleon with his idea of world domination. And what is it like, to lie on a military road? You get plundered by the Reds, then you get plundered by the Whites \[C: ""Reds"" and ""Whites"" are colloquial names of two biggest factions of the Russian Civil War\]. So, seriously speaking, state of the principality was in direct correlation with the state of its roads: the worse are its roads, the better it lives. One should note, though, that country's enroute location was the definitive prerequisite for its independence. Legend has it that Charlemagne granted this part of Barcelona principality (then part of France) independence in gratitude for the help of locals, who guided his army through Pyrennes into present-day Spain, where he defeated Moors.

If voters wanted to say that they don't like the Conservative way of doing things, they had to tactically vote Labour, regardless of Labour's manifesto, in order to reject the Conservative government. This is because if they voted for anyone other than Labour, they would be splitting the dissenting vote, meaning that the conservatives would gain seats.

In a constituency where the vote is split as 36% Conservative, 32% dissenting party number 1 and 32% dissenting party number 2, it goes down as a Conservative win and suddenly 64% of the electorate in that constituency are represented by 36% of the vote.

In order to prevent this, the dissenting votes have to unify under one party, and the one that is most likely to get enough votes to win a seat is the largest opposing party - which is Labour.

So voters had to vote for a party which has leaving the EU in its manifesto in order to create effective opposition to the incumbent government, otherwise they'd give the incumbent government mandate to do whatever the hell they want.

Which is why its disingenuous to say that 80% of the electorate voted for a leave party, without mentioning the huge amount of context behind that vote. It's being used to imply that 80% of the country want brexit and that is patently false.

Bringing up FPTP vs PR or STV or AV or whatever other system is completely besides the point.

As /u/No_Engineering points out, you’re talking about Brigham Morris Young, aka Madame Pattirini. B. Morris, was Young’s son by Margaret Pierce.

The 11 year old Apostle was John Willard Young who lived lavishly on the church’s dime until his father’s death. He loved New York and spent most of his adult life there. He spent much of his life working for the church securing eastern money for church projects, working for Utah statehood and securing funds for railroads and the like. But the younger Quorum members hated him to a man and dropped him as soon as the older generation died out. Thus forcing the lifelong banking agent to get a job as an elevator operator. 

As another interesting aside John W, also was peripherally involved in he murder of a prostitute. While he was on a trip to Europe police discovered that his apartment was a scene of a murder. Anna Pulitzer’s mutilated body was found in the river but she was quickly traced back to John’s apartment.

1. The immigrants that came from the EU to the UK under the single labour market were skilled workers that complemented understaffed sectors of the UK economy. 2 famous cases would be the Construction and healthcare sectors. Currently there the NHS experiences a severe labour shortage (it was considered to be borderline a national emergency in September). Same with many construction firms.

2. I assume you are referring to immigrants from Muslim countries. Most Muslim residents in the UK are at least second generation immigrants. The Muslim first immigrants come and came to the UK due to reasons completely unrelated to the EU (e.g  family members of UK citizens that may have lived there during and after the British Empire)

3. I assume you are also referring to the wave of refugees that has come to Europe in the past few years? It’s impact has been negligible at best and has not caused even close to as many problems as you would like to think. Strictly economically speaking it would actually be beneficial for the competitiveness of the EU economy.

4. None of the terrorists that have been involved in the recent terror attacks in Europe has been a refugee. They were either a permanent resident of the country or travelled with a fake passport.

5. The UK has a lot stricter laws around hate speech than most EU countries. The EU did not set these laws, the EU does not even concern itself nor imposes any particular laws as far as the political system of a country are concerned, the only requirement being that the country is a constitutional democracy.

Valkorion originally was just a warlord on the planet Zakuul, which is in the Unknown regions.  Following the events of KOTOR, Vitiate took Valkorion as a host body, while simultaneously controlling another host on Dromund Kaas and doing normal EU Sith Emperor stuff.  As Valkorion, he united the people of Zakuul and built up a powerful and advanced civilization.  Hundreds of years pass, and while the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic fight and weaken each other, Zakuul grows and strengthens. Vitiate then abandons the Empire, so they no longer recognize his authority, especially after he tries to eat all life in the universe on Yavin/Ziost.  Then Vitiate/Valkorion leads a crusade into the rest of the galaxy, and generally wipes the floor of the Empire and Republic, not letting anyone know of his true identity.  The Player character of SWTOR finds and kills him, but Vitiates spirit enters his body in the process.  The player then builds a coalition of Empire and Republic forces to defeat Zakuul, now led by Valkorion's son and daughter.    The player succeeds, but then Vitiate fully takes over the PC (surprised pikachu).  You then kill him in your own head, finally defeating him once and for all.

In 2014 I voted for them in the European elections. Then in 2015 I voted Labour, because I was in a Tory-Labour swing seat and hoped for a Lib-Lab coalition. 2017 saw me vote Labour because I was in a safe Tory seat where the Lib Dems were crushed in the previous election. The Lib Dems' continued pro-EU stance put me ideologically in line with them, but I just wanted my vote to help shift the Overton Window leftwards and maybe move my seat towards a wobbly Tory seat rather than safe. Then last year I voted for a Lib Dem councillor. I'd describe myself as a social democrat rather than a socialist.

UKIP also treats cooperation between the interests of class and race (and sexuality) as a betrayal of a traditional, white Britain. You could be right, it's more of a fully audible whistle here. That is why Clive Lewis was so incensed by this speech and those defending it:

""So to hear ED talking about empathising with Tommy Robinson’s supporters and their hatred, yes against the so called liberal left – which given the debate was also shorthand for left Remainers – many of whom are black for the reasons stated above, and how he spoke of black people being used as pawns to subvert the (white) working class (why make a distinction of colour if not?), then I have to say my fucking alarm bells start ringing.""

&gt; Aviation continues to enjoy tax-free status when it comes to fuel, no value-added tax is charged on tickets and airlines are eligible for free carbon permits under the ETS. T&amp;E added that &amp;quot;It is no surprise that the most undertaxed mode of transport is also the one with the fastest growing CO2 emissions&amp;quot; and called for the sector&amp;#039;s permits to be withdrawn.

&gt; The tax situation could change though, after Belgium, the Netherlands and France all suggested that kerosene levies and VAT on tickets could be options to help cut transport sector emissions.

They've worked to establish their financial stability FOR THEM to enjoy, not for you to benefit from by default as their child.

&gt; For them, if it's not a tangible thing that they can buy, then it's not  worth spending the money on. I, on the other hand value experiences over  material possessions, so we've always disagreed there. And this is  becoming one of those disagreements. 

You've asked them to contribute, and they've settled on the value they're willing to contribute. This isn't a negotiation, it's a gift to you and your future husband and you're acting like you're somehow entitled to more? 

&gt; in the last 3-4 years they've built a $40K garage, bought 2 $50k trucks,  a $25K camper/rv and a $30k boat. Not to mention a $100k home remodel  when they downsized and endless yard projects on their 5 acres in the  country. They're both retired, but in this time they've barely been on  any kind of vacation. 

They've done the things that they enjoy doing since they retired, and they're not required to take a vacation to validate some weird expectation you have of what retired people do and how they ""should"" be spending their money. It's THEIR money.

Ya, well you and your fiance have been together for 8 years and could have spent that time saving, so it's not like YOU couldn't see this coming. 

My husband and I were together over 10 years before we got married in my late-20s. Our budget was $15K, but it was very difficult to keep our budget to that amount. My parents offered $5K since they paid for my sister's traveling around Europe. I didn't ask for receipts to make sure I was getting a fair share, I cried and said thank you and had a kick ass party.

&gt; I'm just asking for a little more help to pull off a nice event with good food, a few beers and good company 

It's YOUR wedding that YOU need to budget for what YOU can afford. You're not asking for a little more, you're asking your parents to give you double what they have offered, and actually you want them to pay for half of your wedding.

&gt;When you boil your comments down to their core arguments what you are saying is that, the contents of the reactor are highly radioactive, remote repair will be necessary, and if anything goes wrong it will be expensive.

&gt;Do I understand you correctly?

233C's response:

&gt;**That's pretty much it.**

-------------------------

Yes repair work will be done remotely and that is expensive, but this is factored into the cost projections already, and it is projected to be cheaper than coal even with remote repair work.

Yes fission products are HIGHLY radioactive, I wouldn't want to sleep on a bed of spent fuel rods either. 

The issues he raises are non-issues already accounted for.

To freewheel through idyllic countryside, relishing the cool breeze and glorious scenery sweeping by? To make new friends and admire cultural sights? To enjoy jovial banquets of local food and wine, somehow hoping that the kilos gained will be miraculously offset by the next day’s furious pedalling?

All this came true on my four-day ride through the forests and valleys of southern Transylvania, but there was an unexpected bonus. It was a cultural discovery that elevated an enjoyable break into a brush with the extraordinary, and it begins in 1153 with a long-forgotten king, Géza II of Hungary.

At that time this bucolic plateau cradled by the Carpathian Mountains, which only became part of Romania a century ago, was forever fearful of invasion from the east. In response, the monarch invited German-speaking mercenaries from the Rhineland and Moselle region to defend his borders. Collectively known as Saxons, they settled here for more than 800 years, building robust villages with deftly fortified churches. Devout and talented craftspeople, this industrious community farmed and worshipped with a zeal still evident in the sturdy towers, monumental barns and majestic oak forests that now form the picturesque backdrop to our 115km ride.

Then, in 1989, following the collapse of communism, almost all of them went home — invited back to their ancestral soil by the German government. “There were 1,200 Saxons here before the second world war,” reflects Rosemarie Müller, a teacher in the village of Altina. “Today there are 54.” As she shows me round its elegant church, Müller explains how when a departed villager passes away its bell is rung in tribute — most recently for a 94-year-old man who had fought for the SS and recently died in the United States. A Sunday service still takes place here, with a congregation of 20 at best, stoically singing hymns beneath walls adorned with exquisite 15th-century frescoes

All this makes poignant viewing, but we are not touring ghost villages. While some Saxon houses are boarded up, many have new residents — principally families of Romanians escaping the urban rat-race and savvy western Europeans who have snapped up a cut-price second home. “You can buy a house here with two plots of land for €10,000,” says Marco Nawijn, one of our two guides. A lanky Dutchman, he moved here in 2000 after falling in love with Transylvania’s fence-free grasslands and venerable forests filled with truffles and brown bears. His wife, Donate, is one of several talented chefs who prepare the marvellous feasts for our 12-strong group, where we sit at one big table tucking into dishes of spiced cabbage stuffed with minced pork and farm cheeses drizzled in local honey, all followed by plum cake and fiery tots of palinka (fruit-based brandy).

Our first night is spent in Richis, a village that once traded barrels of wine for Turkish carpets, where I’m billeted in an enchanting Saxon house with an enclosed courtyard, barn and orchard. The next morning we kick off with a 27km ride, and I’m pleased to find our tour company, The Slow Cyclist, advocates both the “slow” lifestyle and a modest rate of pedalling.

Oli Broom, its genial founder, is clearly at home in the saddle having cycled from London to Australia in 2009-10 to watch the Ashes cricket series. That epic journey took him almost 14 months, and setting up our impeccably structured ride has taken nearly as long. “Most of our clients are over 50,” he says, “and only two per cent sport Lycra.” This is borne out by my fellow cyclists who hail from the US, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Many are retired and while one couple has done some serious long-distance cycling and others regularly “chew the handlebars”, the rest of us are content to simply work off the lavish breakfasts. Thanks to the miracle of electric bikes, no one is left behind panting in the buttercups. Half of us have booked one and the benefits don’t just come when a hill looms. They are a boon pedalling into the wind, on boring busy roads, and fleeing ferocious sheepdogs.

Almost half our route is on tarmac back-roads, the remainder on forest tracks or across meadows. Soon we are strung out like a row of fairy lights with a guide at each end, happily ducking in and out of conversations and admiring the fields and vineyards where the Saxons toiled. Seven of their most impressive villages have been inscribed on Unesco’s World Heritage list, including Biertan, where Nawijn shows us its citadel-like church, pointing out the “bacon tower” where food was stored during sieges and a chamber in which couples considering divorce would be locked up and told to sort themselves out.

While this flagship attraction is in healthy condition, elsewhere a battle is being waged to save the splendid buildings the Saxons walked away from. In Copsa Mare, where we stop for lunch, we find a large sign erected by conservationists urging residents to renovate their new homes in a historically sympathetic manner. A big “DA” next to photographs of wooden shutters and terracotta tiles makes it clear that a traditional look is desirable, while gaudy pink walls or a bright red modern roof are most definitely “NU!”.

Some of us feel such advisories are an interference too far, but others, myself included, are in full support. One such campaigning group is the sweetly named Ambulanta Pentru Monumente (Ambulance for Monuments). When I later meet Veronica Vaida, one of its leaders, she explains that their motivation stems from nothing more than the fact that “these buildings are beautiful and we can’t bear to see them fall apart”.

Rescue methods take many forms, from the establishment of a kiln that makes authentic roof tiles to “interventions” when a volunteer team descends on a building to carry out preservation work. This recently happened in Copsa Mare, where the church roof has been repaired, and Vaida admits it is easier to protect such communal buildings rather than private dwellings. “How do you feel about garden gnomes?” I ask when we spy a few chuckling away by a garden fence. “They are necessary kitsch for someone,” she sighs.

We don’t always cycle. After a hearty meal of chicken stew, fresh strawberries and an excellent Liliac wine, Nawijn announces that we will now walk 3km uphill. He doesn’t lie. “When will they invent electric legs?” one of us wails, but the Transylvanian countryside is so captivating it deserves appreciation on foot. Travelling in early May we are too soon to catch its famous wild flower meadows in their full glory, but the landscapes are sufficiently enchanting to make us wonder why the Saxons left all this for the traffic-filled streets of Munich and Nuremberg. We are told their lifestyle was already on the wane — after the war thousands were sent to Soviet labour camps, and then their lands were taken away by the communist regime.

That night we slip back to the 18th century with a stay at Apafi Manor, a hilltop mansion in Malancrav restored by the Mihai Eminescu Trust, which is dedicated to the regeneration of Transylvanian villages. With its formal gardens, pared-down bedrooms and huge library of English-language books, some of us wish we could hole up here for a day or two, playing the piano and reading Rousseau. But no — we have 40km to gobble up in order to reach Sighisoara, a city that has the misfortune to be the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler and has the plastic axes and Dracula souvenirs to prove it. Conscious of this tacky side, Broom checks us into the well-appointed Fronius Residence, where we march in like a weary, mud-splattered platoon then later emerge clean and refreshed for a slap-up private dinner of wild garlic soup, stuffed eggs and cured meats.

Over the next two days, as we cycle and hike to Crit and then Mesendorf, we hit our rhythm. By now we are bonded and fit, and we adore our magical rides across hills like green corduroy and long descents on narrow trails that weave through the silent heart of ancient forests pierced by sunbeams. At Viscri, ahead of our farewell meal, we sit outside a bar chatting till the cows come home — literally. Their daily return from the fields, along with a clutch of horses, is a thousand year-old spectacle, a bovine paseo that brings every villager into the main street to watch as each animal dutifully peels away from the herd to enter its respective barn.

Transferring back to Sibiu airport by minibus the next morning, I look out from the motorway at the flat fields and dull industrial buildings and think how easy it would be to pass through Transylvania and assume there was little to see. As this most stimulating journey reveals, rich rewards await those who explore its hidden corners on two wheels, from the utter joy of whizzing downhill at 40kph dodging cowpats to the compelling story of the pious Saxons who farmed and flourished here for eight centuries. As one of their many wall-hangings, lovingly embroidered in Gothic lettering, reminds us: Ein fröhliches Herz nicht Gold und Pracht ist was den Menschen glücklich macht (A cheerful heart, not gold and splendour, is what makes people happy).

His claim is

&gt;If you import 10,000 Africans, that will multiply to like 80,000 in 20-30 years, and then ~500,000 in 50-60 years, and then after 3 generations you have multiple millions of them

So in ~25 years, roughly 5,000 couples will produce 70,000 children. That's 14 children per couple in 25 years. I'm not going to bother with the math for the rest, but it's just as ridiculous.

Eastern European and slavic countries have demographic problems. The answer to that is to fight corruption and build up the countries to make them worth living in so the youth doesn't run away to Germany. Not to lie about refugees running away from wars to turn them into scary monsters so that people think that refugees are the root of the problem.

&gt;and IQ

IQ results are affected by so many factors. Of course countries with poor economies and poor education infrastructure will do worse than others. And of course countries with education systems that closer match what kind of skills an IQ test requires will do better. It's not a genetic issue, it's so much more than that.

I mean, historically minorities haven't really had any sort of major political power, so why would you expect any meaningful majority of them to ""have much to offer to the political theory discussion""? All I see here is that the white liberals get to win twice.

[],Intranetusa,1388905461.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ens8u,False,"&gt;According to the Osprey Books on the Han Dynasty

The Osprey books also portray the Han Dynasty troops as wearing European dragon scale armor, using Persian style square wicker shields, and having fictional bamboo shafted metal spears. The book also portray soldiers as wearing bare brown rawhide when we know that armor was actually lacquered and painted thanks to archaeological discovery of pigments and trace elements on the terra cotta warriors. Needless to say, much of the Osprey stuff is based on outdated or incorrect information. New records and new archaeological discoveries have invalidated much of Osprey's stuff on the Han Dynasty.

&gt; their levy troops were scarcely trained 

The Han milita troops were trained for 1 year and served for a year. Roman troops by the time of Vegetius were trained for ~4 months according to Vegeitus' De Re Militari. Many Roman troops would gain more experience through constant campaigning because soldiering was their jobs, but in terms of their actual initial training, they received less basic training time than Han troops. Though Roman auxillaries, who made up an equal number (and later a superior number) to the legionaires, would probably be trained less than this. The 1 year training also applies to the Han's volunteer and levied militas, and may not apply to the Han professional armies who could receive even more training.

&gt; had awful cavalry (except for a few barbarian allies)

Nope. The Han Dynasty defeated the Xiongnu Confederation on their home terf in the steppes and deserts of Central Asia, Mongolia, and Russia. The defeated northern Xiongnu had to migrate west, possible eventually becoming the Huns.

The Han Dynasty also sent an army into Ferghana to capture a Greco-Persian city so they could get Nisean horses (the same horses the Persians used for their cataphracts). 

You can say their cavalry wasn't that great in the beginning, but they implemented a many decades long program to breed more and better horses, train more cavalrymen, and beef up their cavalry forces.

&gt;(not that they had to be, as all of their enemies were far smaller than they were numerically)

Not always. They were outnumbered in many of their battles against the Xiongnu as it is difficult to send a huge army hundreds of miles into deserts and steppes.

&gt;their infantry were almost all completely unarmored,

Incorrect. The terra cotta soldiers of the preceding Qin Dynasty shows many of their infantry were armored. The Han Dynasty improved on the Qin armors. The Han used many troop types - light, medium, heavy, etc - so they had plenty of lightly armored troops, but also plenty of heavily armored troops.

Archaeology has unveiled a lot of new stuff on Han armor...for example, check out the Han lamellar with armored sleeves that almost go to the elbows, or mural depictions of armored cavalrymen with armored collars.

&gt;Both the Romans and the Chinese of this period relied on sword and shield wielding infantry

Incorrect. Most of the Han's troops were equipped with pikes, swordstaffs, halberds, and crossbows - not swords. IIRC, the Chu-yen slips excavated from Han era armories/garrisons showed 80-90% of the weapons were polearms and crossbows.

&gt;the main advantages the Chinese had over their enemies were sheer numbers and technological superiority,


Most Han armies weren't that big. They initially tried to send many divisions of pike, halberd, and crossbow infantry after the Xiongnu early in the Xiongnu-Han Wars, but they got completely outmaneuvered. The cavalry and mounted infantry expeditionary armies that were more successful in defeating the Xiongnu were sometimes inferior in size.

You're also forgetting superior training. Pike formations and crossbow volley fire formations don't appear out of nowhere. Read some works by Rafe de Crespigny and others:

""...in the winter of 167/168 identifies the weapons and units of his army: ...'three ranks of [long] halberds (changzu) sowrdsmen (liren) and [long] spearmen (changmao), supported by crossbows (qiangnu) with light cavalry (jingji) on each wing.'"" -(p. 157 Fire over Luoyang: A History of the Later Han Dynasty 23-220 AD By Rafe de Crespigny

""The Han introduced the concept of massed crossbow attack by line of crossbows, and even mounted crossbowmen. Range would be about 280 meters. Just how powerful a crossbow could be, is glimpsed in the excavated Chu-yen slips from which records of crossbow maintenance was kept....typical Han era crossbow of 6 stone [~387lbs]""

(History &amp; Uniforms 9 ENG By Bruno Mugnai)

""Crossbows remained one of the major weapons in Song times. In the eleventh century, Shen Gua argued that the crossbow is to the Chinese what the horse was to the Khitan -- the asset that gave them their advantage. In field battles against foreign cavalry, the Chinese infantry would have a row of pikemen with shields, rows of archers, and a row of crossbowmen. When the cavalry approached, the crossbowmen would shoot first above the crouching pikemen and bowmen. The pikemen and archers would shield the slower-firing crossbowmen, who, however, could inflict more damage."" https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/miltech/crossbow.htm https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/index.htm 

The historian here, Patricia Buckley Ebrey, mostly specializes in Song Dynasty history, but the tactics are applicable to earlier eras as well. One of the videos below or another article discussing mentioned similar tactics dating back to the Warring States era.

""The Qin also employed long spears (more akin to a pike) in formations similar to Swiss pikemen in order to ward off cavalry. The Han Empire would use similar tactics as its Qin predecessors. Halbers, polearms, and dagger axes were also common weapons during this time.""

""Finally, the Qin and Han Dynasties also developed crossbow shooting lines, with alternating rows of crossbowmen shooting and reloading in a manner similar to a musket firing line.""

Just from observing alone, we can infer all kinds of micro-narratives that played out as different reddits mobilized their people/resources to try and gain recognition and a place on a trending platform. 

What is to be said about America's presence on the internet at the time, as they tried to dominate the center space, fighting valiantly to maintain that top podium as the entire internet was attacking 'round the clock. Almost decimated in the constant onslaught, but like the poem says, in the waning hours ""our flag was still there.""

Or the German's forgoing the center space in an attempt to banner a sizeable portion. Then, with their French counterparts attempts at intersecting them vertically to cut them in half, the two sides inadvertently reopened the Balkans for civil unrest as various ex-Yugoslav states began invading the battlefield and establishing their own territorial claims. Then the divulsion into a patchwork of Euro states, as Germans fought to hold off their eastern front from fractals of barbarian clans chipping away at them, and the European Union was established as a buffer state between the *Carolingian* factions. They've been fighting each other for that middle space since 833 CE.  

Scandinavia set themselves up in the top rafters and masterbated ""Dutch Rudder""-style.

Britain held their own. Canada grew three sizes. Ireland started tall, got taller. Scotland held their own too, might have some overlap though with Chelsea fans because clearly people like them a little more than an entire country. 

The *Mona Lisa* was hung on the wall, beside her sister in liberty, the Star Spangled Banner. In the midst of this microcosm of European warfare over the last 1.5 milenia, Switzerland set itself up in the bosom of Da Vinci's masterpiece, high on the hills above the other warring Germanic and Slavic states. Asserting its neutrality and geometric flag, lovers' of art and art critics alike came together to agree that the Swiss deserve recognition and safety from the other squabbling Euro-states. It is the first time in the entire history of human civilization that the art world has shared consensus on one particular thing, and it happened on reddit. Checkmate, atheists.

A genius somewhere came up with the idea of recreating the Windows 95 taskbar. I applaud you, whoever you are.

Very interesting how that tends to work out. Anyway...

America in the 1960s was basically a giant mish-mash of Europeans from all over the continent, and it was better than today by far. Ethnic conflict was an absolute dream compared to today and seemed to have been based on religious differences that never really caused any major conflicts. White-on-white crime in America was and is very low. Therefore, it would appear that different European ethnicities can assimilate quite well with each other. The same is demonstrably not true of non-whites in the same country. 

I think we're getting into the weeds here, mostly because you've derailed the topic to focus on pointless minutia.

Yes. Mostly those who develop multi-resistant TB have had it before, at least once. First hand treatment in most cases is still very good and very responsive. Luckily in the UK our contact in minimal and cure rates are very good because treatment is accessible. Hence places like Belarus and Moldova have harder time, with less treatment options. And if you have had it several times before - it is harder to get rid of the condition each time.  It comes back.  As said upthread, it is about close contact. as used to be the case in UK and Ireland 100 years ago - sharing certain conditions in poor housing. So your kids may not have any of the factors despite grandparents.  I had a relative in Ireland who died of TB in the 1960s because it came back and his lungs were shot. Not that long ago, really.

It was originally the new year, heralding the change of seasons in ancient and Medieval Europe, at least until they adopted another calendar and put January 1 as the New Year. April 1 then became a day where it was acceptable to prank people.

It's a tradition that still persists in the 2060s. And would cause more than a few issues in a warzone, when paired with a vindictive, hedonistic doll.

---

Commander Hams had hoped he was prepared for today.

He didn't mind the more harmless pranks. The ol' whoopie cushion, switching of salt and sugar, even the odd noisemaker, he'd simply let slide and quietly reassign the responsible parties to either watching Architect or cleaning the maintenance bays. The punishments would serve as a gentle reminder that pranking would not be tolerated, even if he did.

However, he had his eye on three possible, even dangerous, pranksters on his base. The first of which was blushing and fidgeting in her seat as she relentlessly shitposted.

""I trust that everything is well online and you're not spreading vicious, untrue rumours, MDR.""

In terms of deadly prankery, MDR's was dangerous in the psychological sense: a well-placed rumour could have sent the entire base either on high alert or in a huge mess.

""Um... no, Commander?""

In the week leading up to White Day, while he was testing a new IOP male doll model, he had tasked her with protecting him at night after two nights of very unwelcome guests in his bed. He had rewarded her with a place in his bed (and he swears he did not do anything she didn't consent to, meaning nothing happened).

And she had developed a very obvious crush on the hamster. Being extremely handsome did help.

""Good. Keep monitoring the Zenner Net and other digital channels for any problematic prankery.""

He considered MDR's sudden femininity adorable, and extremely useful. Which tied up one major issue.

The other was P7. Her pranks were a bit more obvious in effect. Ultimately less than lethal, her pranks could have serious issues on morale, but she had promised the commander that she'd limit herself to a single noisemaker-related prank. It didn't fully reassure him, but she also didn't want to sit and watch Architect channelling her inner tomato. She had been very insistent on that.

Which left just one unruly prankster.

He called Architect's guards.

""C-MS speaking, Commander~""

""Good afternoon, CMS. Is Architect in her cell?""

""The loud kitty-cat is playing with her right now. Can I get a popsicle when we're done? I've been good.""

""Yes, you'll get your frozen treat. Did ART556 come around?""

""...No? Architect doesn't like ART after ART stole her tomatoes and pelted her with them.""

""Keep your eyes peeled and there might be something else in it for you.""

""Okay, Commander~ Bye~""

A similar call to the armoury also yielded similar results. He'd told the armourers to double check everything and all stocks of ammunition, explosives and anything that could conceivably be used against dolls.

Which only left one place to ch-

""Yes, Springfield?""

""Commander, remember that time I found a certain jar of green liquid?"" Her voice was anxious.

""Springfield, I do, and that thing should have been disposed of by Biohazard.""

""Erm, actually...""

""Damn it, Springfield. We have humans on base and you kept COLLAPSE FLUID?""

""Collapse Fluid? Oh no...""

There was no time to regret anything. He would have to educate his division on dangerous Precursor artifacts and the Belian Incident on a later date. 

""Springfield, drop everything, grab your match-grade ammo and meet me in the office in one minute. MDR, put the entire base on NBC lockdown, right now. And... call SAT8. I am sadly in need of her... eccentricities right now.""

---

""Ladies, I have called you in here for a very important mission. ART556 has in her possession a jar of Collapse Fluid and she intends to use it on someone, presumably on one of the humans on base or worse, on me. Collapse Fluid is not only dangerous but also has deleterious effects on the environment that even dolls cannot work in for extended periods. I cannot stress the importance of not getting any of it on you, or on ANYTHING.""

The tiny commander looked at the three dolls standing in front of his desk.

""Springfield, you are to provide sniper fire. MDR, your energy shielding will be of use here. SAT8, since you're the one with actual NBC training AND having a history with ART, you're going to secure that damn jar before it leaks or breaks.""

""You are also authorized to use less than lethal force. That means arm and leg shots only. Try to take her alive or unconscious if it is reasonably possible. And no, SAT8, your restraining order still stands.""

The blonde Italian shotgun doll was crestfallen. Again.

---

ART556 was in very high spirits. She had stolen a jar of an unidentified green liquid she didn't even know the base had. Springfield had taken great pains to hide it, so it must be something super duper secret and would probably make the commander angry!

Good, she thought. The angrier the little killjoy was, the better, especially if the contents of that jar was emptied on him! And his cage! And his office! And everything he held dear!

That'll teach him to make me apologize to that Italian bore, she deviously reflected. How dare he interrupt my fun.

---

""There she is!"" Springfield shouted.

Shit, ART thought to herself. If Springfield was here, then that also means the tiny killjoy was nearby. They probably knew what she was going to do with the jar she had! There was no time to waste.

ART led Springfield and whoever was following her through a short run around the base. She did her best to ditch her captors, but even if she would lose one, another would pop up. In fact, she was most surprised when she saw MDR fire a burst at her.

""YOU TRAITOROUS THOT"" ART screamed at MDR. ""THE ONLY THING YOU WANT IS FOR THE COMMANDER TO HOLD YOUR HAND, YOU SLUTTY, LEWD SHITPOSTER"" Her angry insults had zero effect on MDR, who was not only carrying the commander in one of her MOLLE pockets but also knew everyone knew about her maiden heart anyway.

""Give it up ART. Whatever you're planning WILL go on your permanent record. And I have the authority to not only retire you but also charge you for your crimes done during your service! Drop the jar or I will order your execution, dismantling and erasure of your digimind!"" the commander was not pulling any punches.

""See if I care!"" ART was not giving up.

---

They had chased ART into... the mess hall. It was fortunate that no one was in it.

""ART, dear, listen to the Commander just this once, that's a very dangerous thing you're holding."" Springfield pleaded.

""That only means the Commander will get very mad!""

""Damnit ART, stop making this harder for y-""

""GO TOUCH YOURSELF TO THE COMMANDER PUTTING HIS ROBODICK INTO YOUR ROBOPUSSY, THOT"" MDR had to force herself to not cry. There was only so much abuse even the seasoned shitposter could take, especially if it was aimed at her maiden's heart.

""It's okay, MDR, I'm not judging you or anything.""

""Commander, this is getting nowhere. Permission to tackle her?"" SAT8 commed in, aggression creeping into her voice as she spoke.

""Denied. ART still has the jar.""

The tension in the air was thick enough to stop Jupiter Cannon rounds. ART only scowled at the three dolls and the commander.

""If you want this jar so badly, you can HA-"" 

""ART, catch!""

A flashbang grenade came sailing into the mess hall.

It exploded into a ball of light and sound.

This stunned ART briefly, which was long enough for SAT8 to manhandle the errant doll and disarm her of the deadly jar.

---

""P7."" The Commander addressed the average-sized doll dressed in a nun's habit while peeking out of MDR's combat gear.

""Yes, Commander?"" P7 put on her cutest face. She hoped that her cute self, coupled with the fact that she saved the Commander's life (in a sense), would allow her to worm her way out of trouble.

""A flashbang grenade is decidedly several degrees above a mere noisemaker, and you are not authorized to touch them.""

""But Commander, I came in at the right time to save you, so it's okay just this once?""

""Yes, P7, you do have a very cute point there. And for that,"" the commander motioned for MDR to let him out and to hand him off to P7. ""you are going to be tomorrow's adjutant.""

""Oh, commander, you should-""

""...Right after you report to CMS and IDW. You're fine with helping them guard Architect, right?""

""Yes, Comman- What.""

If there was one lesson P7 would never learn, it was that she could never out cute the Commander.

&gt;Warships 3D is customizable battleship-like game done in 3D environment with animations and cutscenes. Players can define their own rules like map size, which ships are available and at which events what weapons will be granted to player(s). The game is played in 2 stages, in the first stage the player places his ships on the opponent's map, while in the second stage the player's objective is to find and destroy enemy ships on his own map.

It has been made in Unreal Engine 4.

In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed over 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the city centre. An estimated 22,700 to 25,000 people were killed, although larger casualty figures have been claimed.

Other diagnostic tests are usually always denied and require a fight. 
I’m not very well read on the differences between NHS free healthcare and your privatized options though. 
Regardless, US’s private healthcare is pretty shitty.  Like for instance, I’m in an accident and taken to the ED. Even if that hospital accepts my health insurance, a lot of the doctors at the hospital aren’t directly employed by that hospital and one can be assigned a doctor that does not participate with your specific insurance company. They make you aware of this upon your admission, but at that point you’re really in no position to say “Thanks, but I’d rather go somewhere else.”  
So after that, and all the tests they run on you, your insurance may deny the treatment or since the attending doctor is ‘out of network’ you’re not just responsible for your regular out of pocket copay, but you’re charged with out of network fees. So for a hospital stay (maybe 3 days or so) might cost at least $25,000 and you are responsible to pay 40% of that out of pocket since that is what the out of network fee is for my insurance currently. 
I’m not speaking for everyone is the US, but I know that any of the PPO plans that are available to me where I live are all like this. It might be worse for people with HMO’s here, which is why I went for a PPO. Also went with the PPO because with my medical history I see a lot of specialists, and if I had an HMO I would be required to see my GP separately and get a referral before I could go see a specialist or my insurance wouldn’t allow me to see the specialist directly.   I’m oversimplifying a lot of the insane intricacies, but this is pretty standard for our healthcare system.

The industrial heartlands that modern tech hit the hardest lost a lot of jobs. According to Yangs numbers 4 million people lost their jobs and only 2 million of them ever returned to the workforce. Is it an accident that these areas have those huge suicide and particularly overdose spikes?

What sort of symptoms would an area have where a lot of jobs are getting wiped out have? Men with no futures tend to do very self destructive things...

&gt; What are you talking about here exactly? Do you mean the unemployment rate? Because in the EU, it's 6.5% right now, but in the U.S. it's 4%. So what are you referring to here?

Unemployment rate is easy as hell to manipulate, and measures an odd thing anyway.

Lets say we have 10 million unemployed people for 10% unemployment.     
Scenario A: We create 5 million new jobs and now have an unemployment of 5%         
Scenario B: 6 million people give up looking for jobs and now we have an unemployment of 4.25%

Is B *really* a better scenario? Almost a million people in the Rust Belt filed for disability after 4 million of them lost their jobs. Looks great for unemployment, but it's like the worst of all conceivable worlds.

Check out the stats here:   https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm

USA is at 71%, but UK is at 74.5%, Germany at 76%, Sweden at 77.9%, Switzerland at 80.3% and Iceland at a pretty staggering 85.3%.

Now we can ignore Iceland because it's tiny, but Switzerland is meaningful. If US had Switzerlands employment rate, we'd have to employ almost 20 million more people...

You have to admit that given those numbers claiming Iceland might have higher unemployment than the US is pretty ridiculous. Only thing it says is that US has a lot of people who've dropped out of the work force.

&gt; What makes you think suicides are ""spiking"" at all? And again, what makes you think it has anything to do with automation? Don't you find that to be an odd leap/assertion?

It's not a rock solid case, but the areas in the Rust Belt that got hit by the job losses have all been hit quite hard by this, while states that are enjoying modern economy jobs are doing better. [2005 to 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm).

&gt; Based on what? Where are you getting this idea from? How are you measuring the death of the middle class?

Gini index is a good one. [This](https://www.statista.com/statistics/203183/percentage-distribution-of-household-income-in-the-us/) also somewhat surprisingly for a Middle Class country is not a bell curve, but spikes up at both ends. 

Also anecdotally working in robotics, we keep aiming at the poor people making between $40k and $110k. Easiest targets. The cheaper people are competitive because they're so damn cheap. The people solving hard problems make way more than $110k. But those in the middle? Juicy targets.

&gt; The ""gulf"" between the rich and poor is not an issue as long as the standard of living for the poor continues to improve. Which it is

Is it? You should try to visit places like Western MA, Southern Ohio, all of WV etc. We've created a really pretty damn depressing and desolate area of the country that mimics the south in many ways.

The factory where we make our robots is in Southern Vermont and it can get pretty grim in the whole area. MA also has this vast group of people doing insanely well while the other half of the population is basically just living off meth and opioids (a little unkind, but the numbers kind of back me up).

&gt; It is a communist talking point you just cited--I don't know if you realize that

Not really. Poor economic mobility creates violence when people realize that they have no chance to make it to the top. And US has pretty miserable economic mobility these days. My kids will be basically guaranteed to be in the top 20% even if they fail at almost everything, for example.

&gt; Poor people in America live very, very well comparatively to poor people in say...Africa

Sure. But poor people in America have pretty horrible lives compared to poor people in Northern Europe, which I'd consider a more appropriate peer group. Instead of aiming to beat Africa, I'd like to try and beat the Netherlands and Switzerland. And we're really, really far from that.

&gt; Poor people in America have carpet on their floors, insulation in their walls, televisions, phones, and laptop computers all with internet access. 

... and a nice street corner to live on if someone gets sick enough. Or if people like me sell their employers good enough robots.

&gt; In America, our poor people are obese, whereas everywhere else in the world, their poor people are starving. Think about that.

Yeah because they can't afford fruit. I mean yes, you have me convinced that I'd rather be poor in the US rather than India or Nigeria, or even China. But that's a pathetic peer group to compare us to (no offense to any Indians, Nigerians or Chinese readers).

&gt; whereas everywhere else in the world, their poor people are starving

Except the roughly 600m people living in perfectly wealthy societies in Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Canada etc.

&gt; The only place I know of right now who is handling their drug addict problem (homelessness problem) properly is Rhode Island

Check out Portugal and Netherlands. They're doing very well with their drug addicts.

&gt; But this America you keep attacking as being great for rich people and nobody else well....that's not the America I see

To me being a $500 expense from a crisis is not ""great"". It's positively developing world. The precariousness of the life of many people in the US is just stunning for someone who has lived elsewhere in the developed world.

There are hundreds of thousands of medical bankruptcies (as many as a million a year!)

I think you're having something of a Stockholm syndrome because you don't know how much better a lot of people have it than they are in the US. 

People are stressed as hell over things they shouldn't have to be stressed over like healthcare and ability to get shelter.

Yes the  were explicitly antifascist, Nazis rejected everything the fascist philosophy stood for. 

Mussolini criticized Hitler so many times without success:

&gt; &gt; Nordicism and biological racism were often considered incompatible with the Italian fascist philosophy; Nordicism inherently subordinated Italians and other Mediterranean people beneath the Germans and Northwestern Europeans in its proposed racial hierarchy, and Italian fascists, including Mussolini, viewed race as a cultural and political invention rather than a biological reality.

&gt; &gt; In 1929, Mussolini noted that Italian Jews had been a demographically small yet culturally integral part of Italian society since Ancient Rome.

- Cagot

- Burakumin

- Jews

- Mandarins

- Kazoku 

- Slaves

- Lottery winners

- Every European ethnic group in America (North, South, everywhere)

- Brahmin

- Dalit

- Gypsies

- Muslims

- Copts

- Asians in general

- Huguenots/random Christian heretics/Protestants

- Sikhs

- European nobles in any country including the former-CCCP ones

- Kulaks

- Rich non-Guarani and Guarani

- Various Bon-guan (like in the Guarani example, people were forced *by law* to marry outside of their Bon-guan, and yet they still assortatively mated for status to the exact same degree as if they had mated in their clan)

- Mapuche (like the Cagot, Burakumin, and Slaves, not all of these are happy stories)

- Chileans (under Allende or Pinochet, it doesn't matter! The same holds for *anyone born under any junta that subsequently liberalised*)

- the Basque

- Way more.

Notably, Campbell &amp; Lee (2010, 2011) also interpret their Chinese status persistence data -- which occurred despite people being trucked across the country, clans being dissolved, communities displaced and destroyed, millions murdered, property expropriated and never returned, &amp;c. -- as consistent with the importance of kin networks and extended-family strategies (note: [not evidenced] (https://www.reddit.com/r/evopolitics/comments/b86692/z/ejwneuc) in a meaningful way in any of these works). Greif, Iyigun &amp; Sasson (2012) ran with this and held that the truth of this proposition in China explains why they had so much less technological development than Europe. But, it's true in *every single society on Earth to essentially the same exact degree, no matter the circumstance,* so why should it be an explanation for China? Why not Japan or Sweden? When it comes to the rest of these instances where people tend to offer very specific and largely *ad hoc* explanations, I don't see how they could possibly think arguing for sheer coincidence is productive.

&gt;1.) First and foremost, we need to know who we are letting into our home. We need to know their criminal records, any sign of extreme religious/political activism, etc. Make sure they aren't dangerous to the population. We need medical records to make sure immunizations are concurrent with our standards.

So registration? Not the worst thing. Some sort of record, perhaps a social security number isn't the worst thing to be giving people, but that doesn't seem to match what people are talking about when thyr refer to immigration laws. 


&gt;2.)Make sure they provide a net benefit to society. It's obvious what we as a country are offering them, but what are they offering us? Are they educated? Do they have marketable skills/trades? 

This is silly. We don't need to make sure they fit some high standard if they are are immigrating for that purpose. Often times immigrants must leave their nation because it doesn't offer them the opportunity to learn these things. 

&gt;Do they speak the language, or are they making efforts to learn the language so they will be able to assimilate? Look at how poorly the refugees are assimilating in europe while the vast majority just suck up benefits; they are a net DRAIN on society.

This is a bad take imo. America is regarded as a great melting pot Because of the cultures and languages and people we allow to thrive in our nation. It's the same reason America doesn't have an official religion or an official language, we want cultures to be able to grow and impact each other. 


&gt;3.) We can't possibly fix everybody's problems; it's just the way it is. 

I disagree with the way you present this. Sure we can't fix literally everyone and everything, but we should try to do as much as we can right? We should always be striving to help people rather than just clap are hands and say ""that's it, progress is done""

&gt;There are poor/violent countries everywhere, but if you start importing entire populations into prosperous/safe countries, you will reduce them to another poor/violent country.


Again I don't know that this is true. First, nobody is anywhere close to suggesting that entire populations would come and fill America. It's actually fairly absurd to think that is anywhere close to a possibility. Second, theres no evidence that that would actually reduce America to a worse state than it is currently at.

Cheap labor drives down the cost of labor for everybody who works (if the lettuce farm can pay an illegal $4/hr, wal-mart can pay a citizen minimum wage because they don't have to worry about competing for unskilled labor with the lettuce farm. if the lettuce farm pays $11/hr, wal-mart is gonna have to pay $11/hr or else all their employees are gonna go work at the lettuce farm), and illegals who work under the table aren't contributing tax money back into the system and often times they are sending money back home so the money doesn't end up back in circulation here. totally unfair to all taxpayers.

So they should pay taxes? That's already a law for everyone, I'm not sure how refusing immigrants at the border is a better way to fix this issue. 


&gt;5.) helps curb the human trafficking/sex slave issue


Fella, the people trafficing slaves are taking them *out* of America, in order to deal with that you would have to discuss the immigration laws of other countries. 


&gt;i won't count this as a point because it's my opinion, but putting the needs of illegals before our own poor/destitute populations and communities because it's politically advantageous to do so at this point in time is so egregiously offensive that it's almost funny.

It's not a zero sum game, you can focus on both. Matter of fact most of the politicians that push border security in America also push law's that actively harm the lower class in America.

Those who live anywhere outside London see the problem mass immigration forced by the EU has caused, I'm not blaming immigrants for this, its purely down to poor policies and planning. 

- British adults cant get jobs
- Public transport is massively overcrowded
- There is no housing for our children to live
- When people can get jobs, outside of being a graduate you get paid fuck all. 
- School are overpopulated meaning our children don't get the education they should.

In London you may tolerate these issues because all the investment is centred there but outside there is no investment. We don't see the advantages of immigration that you see. We just see the problems.

Whilst immigrants are not the ones who've cause this issue, something needs to be done to tackle these issues and the population staying the same/decreasimg is an easy way of doing that.

Adding to this it has created huge divides in our communities due to different ways of living, language, beliefs, what we eat, what we drink.

The EU as an advocate for immigration should have set out better policies to handle this, not just in the UK but across the continent. They have noone to blame but themselves for this mess.

I’m actually here to showcase not just the SM-39 Razor, but the company that produced the design: The shell corporation, Stavatti. Don’t fall for their futuristic designs; Stavatti is a scam and it has been since its inception. Just try not to laugh when you read about them.

First thing’s first, the SM-39 Razor:

The SM-39 is a next generation air superiority fighter and fighter-bomber. Designed to perform the missions of the F-22, F-15, F/A-18E/F and the now retired F-14 Tomcat and A-6 Intruder, the SM-39 is a twin engine, piloted or unpiloted autonomous, low observable aircraft. With two internal weapon bays, a variable dihedral empennage, double slotted flaps with boundary layer blowing, thrust vectoring nozzles and titanium foam metal sandwich construction, the SM-39 is a sixth to seventh generation fighter and a direct bridge between atmospheric aircraft and future reusable space fighters.

Of radical planform, the SM-39 is a triple fuselage design featuring a streamlined center, high fineness ratio primary fuselage accompanied laterally by right and left mounted secondary fuselages. The secondary fuselages begin as highly swept wing strakes into which the aircraft wing, empennage, an a single ventral air intake and engine nacelle is blended. This planform configuration results in a significant reduction in supersonic wave-drag, allowing the aircraft to have a volume distribution that is very near the Sears-Haack ideal. Designed for supercruise, this configuration places the wing leading edge within the shock cone of the secondary fuselage wing strakes at Mach numbers as high as 2.5.

In addition to reducing wave drag, the SM-39's triple fuselage design allows for a an efficient distribution of primary aircraft systems. The center fuselage houses principal avionics, including the radome and AESA radar, as well as the cockpit, nose landing gear and two internal weapons bays. The secondary fuselages are home to a high pressure recovery, serpentine variable geometry internal compression air intake, a single variable cycle afterburning powerplant and the main landing gear. Both the center and secondary fuselages house internal fuel tanks, sensors and electronic countermeasures. Distributing aircraft systems laterally as well as longitudinally, the three fuselages result in greater internal volume with lower overall wave drag than any supersonic fighter in service today.

Designed for airspeeds in excess of Mach 3, the SM-39 will be powered by two 50,000 lb class afterburning powerplants. These engines may be enhanced performance derivatives of the P&amp;W F119 or GE YF120, or next generation variable cycle powerplants. The current baseline design features a new design variable cycle turbofan/turbojet that benefits from a titanium diboride cermet compressor, combustor and turbine stage that allows TITs as high as 4,400º F, resulting in a maximum static thrust of 52,400 lbs with an SFC of 1.35. Cruise SFC of this new engine is predicted at values as low as 0.53.

For continuous high speed operations and a corrosion resistant 75 year operational life, the SM-39 will have titanium foam metal sandwich skins with a titanium diboride foam metal core. This nearly monocoque structure will be supporded by an internal framework of laser welded titanium frames, bulkheads and longerons.

Pioneering new approaches in aerodynamics, airframe structures, efficient variable cycle turbine propulsion, plasma low-observability and boundary layer control and integrated avionics, the SM-39 is a Mach 3.3+ fighter with a stall speed as low as 103 KTAS in the landing configuration.

It’s weird. I feel like if they knew what they were doing, their aircraft would eventually become a reality.

And about the company itself well, it was once thought as fantasy, but now they are straight up con artists:

One of the most successful modern individual disinformation campaigns is Stavatti Aerospace. It is a quasi real joint-venture company with a detailed background and information about its products. The main part was the Stavatti F-26 (later renamed SM-36) STALMA. So let's take a look at the sci-fi history: STALMA (Short Take off Advanced Light Multi-role Aircraft) began in 1989 as a concept of a lightweight, multifunctional, single-engine combat aircraft that could replace the F-16C at the turn of the millennium and F-18C. The emergence of the JAST and ASTOVL programs, which later merged into the JSF project, diminished interest in the F-26. However, the potential market, which in the first quarter of the 21st century would be in demand for nearly 6,000 lightweight multi-purpose fighters, was created in 1994 by a private joint venture from Stavatti Corporation, which took over responsibility for further development of the F-26. The company aims to satisfy 15% of this demand. Between 1995 and 1997, a definitive concept was created, which includes unusual negative dart tail ducks (leading edge -32 and drain -51 degrees), variable wing geometry (5 to 70 degrees), engine thrust vectoring, integral avionics and elements of stealth technology. These features are intended to allow the aircraft to have the characteristics of supercruise and super-maneuverability. The supporting parts of the structure are made of aluminum and titanium, almost two thirds of all materials are composites. They are intended to guarantee a life of at least 15,000 flight hours (or 4000 starts and 4,000 landings from the ship at sea). The propulsion unit consists of one Pratt and Whitney F119-PW-100 or PW F135 engine. Raytheon AN / APG-73 radar should be placed in front. Each wing has 4 suspension points, complemented by five on the hull, while the armor should not reduce stealth characteristics with the special RETSD ™ (Radar Elusive Tactical Stores Dispensers). Armament to complement the 20 mm M61A2 Vulcan cannon.

Stavatti heavy industries aerospace corp. F-26 SM-36 stalma stealth 6th generation fighter plane fake fiction
The first prototype was to take off in the course of 2004, then in 2006, later in 2009, and so it will move to infinity, because Stavatti Aerospace is just one big sophisticated fiction. Not that it does not exist completely - it is officially registered by two branches in Minnesota and in New York, and sometimes occasionally participates in various competitions for new military aircraft. But it is not an end in itself. The founder of the whole enterprise - young boy Christopher R. Beskar can officially show at least some activity and legalize his activity, consisting in catching stupid and ignorant investors who do not understand the aviation industry at all to invest their money in the company. It is clear that a promised five to twenty-fold yield in the event of success in a selection procedure will never be seen, but Christopher apparently suffices for a decent living. The only thing that has to be done is to occasionally upgrade the portfolio of its products to offer, as well as other types of SM-27 Machete, SM-81 Mamba and SM-46 Aviara. Want a business plan for other handy scammers? I hope not.

What this means is that, unless something is done to fix this, the government will not be able to pay out social security and Medicare for the next few generations. Those trust funds have given too much already and domestic and foreign investors aren’t really too hyped about loaning money to the government either. We can’t really raise taxes because of this phenomenon in which tax revenue always hovers around 17% of the GDP, which is a trend that has been around for at least a century. The only other outlet is to print more money, which means we will see more inflation. Inflation is mostly just a tax on raw savings that people have in their savings accounts. So that sucks.

If we took serious action right now to stem the bleeding, we could be at a point where we are making enough revenue to cover the interest on our unfunded obligations in a matter of just 5 years or so.

I’ve been searching this sub and the various sellers for about 2 months and finally decided to purchase the Balenciaga Speed Trainers with Laces from Ai. I used Ytaopal as my agent. I just sent them Ai’s Yupoo link to the shoes. 

The shoes arrived at the warehouse and the QC pics were uploaded today. 

To be honest I am a little sad with how the shoes look. I’ve uploaded the original QC pics and also edited some to show what I’m concerned about. 

First pic is top view. Marker 1 looks like a glue stain? Marker 2 also looks like a glue stain to me. Marker 3 and 6, I’m not sure if it’s the lightning or if its a stain. Marker 5 looks like the fabric for the lace ribbon is ripping/coming off? Marker 4 and 7, I’m not sure if it’s because of the way the shoes are placed but the Right shoe looks larger than the Left. You can also see that the lace ribbons are not aligned, but again that could be because of the way they are placed on the table. I’ve asked my agent to measure the insoles but it like 7 am over there right now so they prolly won’t reply until later today. Also not sure if it's just me but do the A's at the end of the Balenciaga look fine or are they sinking?

Third and fifth pic are the both sides of the shoe. There is a lot of glue stains along the tops of the soles. Is this something I can get rid of myself or should I RL?

Seventh pic are the back of the shoes. Again there are glue stains. The back seam on the Left shoe aligns through the N, I’ve added a line and drew the N and C as best as I can. The back seam on the Right shoe is perfectly aligned between the N and the C. Now I’ve read that the back seam on retails are usually aligned between the N and C but that there are some retailed that are misaligned as well.

Tenth pic is bottom of the shoes. Looks fine to me.

I’m leaning toward RL, but I’m not sure if that’s me being really picky or if the shoes could be better if I ask for another pair. I’ve tried looking for high detailed retail pics but they are mostly from the side. I know most people go for the regular Speed Trainers but if anyone could help me with QC these I’d really appreciate it! 

Edit: Also the shoes are a EU 38. I usually wear women's US 7.5-8, insoles usually measure 24.5 cm. I asked Ai what size I should get based on my insole measurements and he suggested EU 38. I will update with the insole measurements are my agent gets back to me.

Edit 2: My agent told me that Ai can't get me shoes better than this. Really disappointed. :/ I'm gonna refund. Don't like the look of the regular Speed Trainers so now I'm on the hunt for shoes again!

Edit 3: After thinking it over and looking the QC pics, others QC pics, and retail pics, I've decided to GL. I'll figure out a way to remove the glue stains myself.

read from the title ""From Star to Laggard""Economic growth has slowed to 1.75% and inflation has jumped drastically to nearly 4% (Holy shit on this btw, this is really bad. You produce less, everything costs more.)Yield curve is starting to invert, buisiness investment is approximately 10B pounds short of where it should be already.

Britain is on the cusp of a per-capita recession already, due to world economy. Add a no deal exit?It's going to be a blood bath, and an absolute struggle to limit the booming inflation and decreasing investment. Solutions are pretty limited: go the ""German"" solution post WW2, and experience intense hyper inflation as you print more money in an attempt to stave off the worst of the effects (Terrible policy, will almost certainly cause the worst possible outcome) or introduce austerity measures in an attempt to sever the tie between the inflation in prices from the difficulty in getting product, and the sudden lack of investment, which might save the economy from a massive heart attack... but that's completely different from living standards, and the money needs to come from somewhere, so living standards will be the first thing they look at pulling money back from.

Think about it: That missing 10 Billion pounds of investment... where is that going to come from now? How can a government pony up that cash? There's either the choice of raising taxes, (Impacts standard of living immediately) or cutting services (again, standard of living). There's no real solution to such a hit to the economy, especially when irrelevant of that lost investment, you are suddenly losing huge amounts of tax from business going off-shore, and all goods previously coming from EU, (Approx 242 BILLION A YEAR) costing more as you attempt to source it elsewhere. Then, you can't sell your own goods for as much, because the market that demanded 145 Billion a year worth of your goods, you suddenly have no trade deal with.

As a no deal brexit looks increasingly likely, and your parliament has honestly done sweet nothing in the way of preparing for this mess, you are looking like you are ending up shit creek without a paddle.This COULD be resolved with some serious political intervention NOW, and possibly walk out with no recession, but given the current aptitude of your political class? Good luck.

Either way, even if you guys scrape past a recession, your living standards are taking an inevitable hit, and it's not going to be a little one.

That damage currently happening with your buisiness?

Many have advocated we follow the UK/European path of having mandatory vaccines.

Vaccines are a tremendous benefit to people individually and society. However, they must always remain a *choice*. Without being a choice, there is a massive incentive imbalance.

On central banking, I see it as a necessary feature of the finance capitalism that emerged with the post-Thatcher/Reagan neo-liberalism. Central banking is used to quash any attempts at real reform (look at the EU and how capital restrictions are used to undermine the will of the people in member states), so I'd be happy to see it go away.

But MTG Editions are twice the size of a HS edition. So that rare per pack is way less meaningful.

We can also look at how many cards are made of each rarity:

You have 27 Epic in ~140 cards (19%). In MTG you have rare 54 in ~240 cards (22,5%).

We can also compare HS rares vs MTG uncommons: 36 in 140 (25,7%) vs 60 in 240 (25%).

For shits n giggles lets do Legendaries vs Mythics too: 23 in 140 (16,4%) vs 15 in 240 (6.25%)

So here Epic &amp; MTG rare align pretty equivalent too.


Then we have to take into account, that in MTG you can have 4x the same card in your deck and not only 2 (or 1 in the case of legendary vs mythic). 
Also dusting can be better than trading, since a high in demand card in HS is still the same price, where as in MTG chances are you won't find anyone trading you a set of that go-to rare from the new edition.


According to this site: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics 

If you open 100 packs you'll end up with 20 Epics of 54 (2 copies each) existing ones or 37% 

If you open a MTG display (around the same price here in EU) you'll have 36 rares (+ 3-4 foils) of 240 (4 copies each) or 25%

Tl;dr - MTG rares are like HS epics, if not even harder to get.

PS: Those are only new MTG numbers though, since the sets became smaller. I don't have any numbers on the old big 350-450 card sets.

Ele segue, afirmando que naquele tempo o Brasil vivia sob ""a ameaça do comunismo"", algo amplamente difundido pelo presidente [Jair Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro), e contestado pelos historiadores, para justificar o golpe militar. “Havia sim muito medo no ar. Greve nas fábricas, insegurança em todos os lugares. Foi aí que, conclamado por jornais, rádios, TVs e principalmente pelo povo na rua, povo de verdade, pais, mães, igreja, que o Brasil lembrou que possuía um Exército Nacional. E apelou a ele”.

O Exército nos salvou”, repete ele. “E tudo isso acontecia num dia comum de hoje [sic], [um 31 de março](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/dictadura_brasilena)”. O vídeo não tem nenhuma marca do Governo ou de qualquer instituição oficial. Não foi veiculado em nenhum outro canal governamental, como site ou redes sociais (mas sim na página do [filho do presidente, Eduardo Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/eduardo_nantes_bolsonaro)). Tampouco foi publicado pelo Exército, que, ao final é mencionado por uma segunda voz que afirma que “o Exército não quer palmas, nem homenagens. O Exército apenas cumpriu o seu papel”. Até agora, mais de 24 horas após a veiculação, ninguém assumiu a autoria do material. O Planalto, por meio da Secretaria de Comunicação (Secom), confirma que o vídeo foi enviado pelo canal oficial no WhatsApp, mas afirma que não se pronunciará sobre o caso. Nesta segunda-feira, o vice-presidente Hamilton Mourão quebrou o silêncio sobre o caso e afirmou a um grupo de jornalistas em Brasília que o vídeo “foi divulgado pelo Planalto"" e que foi ""decisão dele [de Bolsonaro]” a sua veiculação.

 Fontes afirmaram à reportagem que o vídeo não foi enviado pela Secom e sim pelo Gabinete Digital, responsável pela gestão das redes sociais e portal do Governo. Questionada sobre a autoria do material e quanto ele teria custado, o Planalto silenciou, ferindo o artigo 5º da Constituição, que concede a livre manifestação do pensamento, mas proíbe o anonimato. Para Gil Castello Branco, do Contas Abertas, entidade que acompanha os gastos públicos, é importante que o Governo esclareça a origem do vídeo. “É preciso saber se foi pago ou não com recursos públicos”, diz. “Em segundo lugar, é preciso saber até que ponto legalmente essa mensagem estaria ou não compreendida dentro do que deve ser a publicidade institucional do Governo”. Ele afirma que independentemente da autoria do vídeo, o Governo endossa a mensagem enviada ao divulgá-la em um canal oficial.

 Bolsonaro, [que está em viagem oficial por Israel desde o domingo](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/04/01/opinion/1554078976_839038.html), mas segue verborrágico em suas redes sociais, não se pronunciou sobre o assunto e nem replicou o material em seus canais. Diferentemente de um de seus filhos, o deputado federal Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP), que publicou o vídeo em sua conta no Twitter logo pela manhã. Pelo horário da postagem, Eduardo Bolsonaro fez a publicação antes mesmo de ela ter sido enviada por WhatsApp.

 A improvável indiferença do presidente em relação a um tema tão próximo a ele não é mero acaso. Na semana passada, Bolsonaro, que não considera a data um golpe, mas sim um ""regime com autoridade"", recomendou que os quartéis comemorassem “a data histórica”. A polêmica diante da postura revisionista do presidente foi parar na Justiça, que concedeu, na noite de sexta-feira, [liminar proibindo as comemorações do golpe pelas Forças Armadas](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/03/26/politica/1553638410_317117.html). Mas, no sábado de manhã, a decisão foi revertida, [abrindo caminho para as celebrações](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/03/30/politica/1553963400_195148.html). Desde a redemocratização, é a primeira vez que o Brasil tem um presidente que defende as festividades dessa data.

 As questões não esclarecidas sobre o material fizeram com que a oposição levantasse suas orelhas no próprio domingo, quando prometeu entrar com representações em todas as instâncias possíveis para questionar o caso. De acordo com o deputado Paulo Pimenta (PT-RS), seu partido recorrerá ao Supremo Tribunal Federal e à Procuradoria Geral da República para denunciar os crimes de improbidade e responsabilidade. O deputado também promete convocar para prestar esclarecimentos na Câmara dos Deputados o secretário de Comunicação, que até o momento é Floriano Amorim.

 O WhatsApp do Governo é um canal criado ainda na gestão de Michel Temer e administrado pela equipe de comunicação do Planalto. Não se trata de um grupo, mas sim de um número que transmite para quem está na lista vídeos institucionais, como os que defendem a reforma da Previdência, e outros materiais de divulgação do Governo. Até o domingo, todo material enviado por esse canal tinha a assinatura do Governo Federal.

* Jennifer Fallon has a range of SFF books - my favourites are probably the **Tidelords** books (book 1 is the Immortal Prince) but her most famous are probably the **Medalon** ones (several related trilogies). She also wrote a sort-of urban fantasy (**The Undivided**) which satisfies the twin square, and a low fantasy (no magic) called the **Second Sons** trilogy. Her stuff is more political/intrigue than big fantasy plots, but they're not dense or depressing.

* Glenda Larke has particularly wonderful worldbuilding and non-medieval European settings - I particularly like her **Stormlords** books but she's got a bunch out, and she's great.

* Thoraiya Dyer's **Titan's Forest** trilogy is now all out - set in a giant multilayered rainforest. First book is **Crossroads of Canopy**.

* Russell Kirkpatrick is technically a NZ author but we stole him. He had several fantasy trilogies in the 00s but his new one is coming out with an Aus press at the end of this year (I think?), and it sounds amazing - called **Silent Sorrow**

* Kate Forsyth mostly writes historical stuff now but she had a successful 90s series called (I think) the **Witches of Eileanan**

* Leife Shallcross wrote a wonderful Beauty and the Beast retelling that came out last year in the UK and just recently in the US called **The Beast's Heart**, told from the Beast's perspective.

* Sean Williams has about forty books out, ranging from kids to adults, mostly SF but some fantasy - **The Books of the Cataclysm** are definitely fantasy.

* Kaaron Warren writes mostly horror, but she has some fantasy too - **Walking the Tree** is one I'm actually reading right now. She's won about every award we have.

* Margo Lanagan - try **Tender Morsels** for some dark fantasy

* Keri Arthur has a wildly successful urban fantasy series but the name is escaping me right now!

* Isobelle Carmody wrote one of the most successful and beloved Australian fantasy YA series - starting with **Obernewtyn**

* Kylie Chan writes Chinese-influenced fantasy - start with **White Tiger**

* Maria Lewis is both a delightful human and a great writer - look for **The Witch Who Courted Death**

* CS Pacat - best known for the  **Captive Prince** books

* Gillian Polack writes hard to pigeonhole literary-end SFF, usually strongly feminist.

* Corey J White writes more in the SF vein, not sure if that counts, but his main one is the **Voidwitch** saga

&amp;#x200B;

\#1. What are the different types of economist roles in financial services:

A. Do what I’m doing and use macro to inform portfolio decisions.

B. . Work on sellside and produce research clients will use and work closely with the sales teams and interact with clients.

C. Work as an internal economist for big financial firm where your forecasts will be used to inform internal strategy Positions.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2. How do you get there?

\-I'm acknowledging my path isn't the most traditional but I basically took an internship and managed to turn it into a a full-time role. I was lucky that my firm was growing.

\- From what I've seen, another path is to do exactly what it seems many people looking here are doing and taking relevant classes to land a role. That can be harder since economist jobs are rarer typically.

\- Another way is to get an advanced degree Masters/PhD and work for a think tank (Brookings, CBO etc) or a policy-oriented institution (IMF, Fed etc) and then transition into financial role. A lot of what I do is looking at what these institutions say so a way to make yourself stand out is to come from a place like that.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3. Am I happy is it rewarding?

\- Yes. I feel lucky that at times my job is getting paid to read the news and to sound smart. Work/life balance is typically better than other roles.

&amp;#x200B;

\#4. Are there downsides?

&amp;#x200B;

For sure. On the buyside, the big money is in investments and sales so economics isn't necessarily a priority. On the sellside, being an analyst can be grueling work and your compensation is usually based on how well your clients and sales team like you rather than how accurate your forecasts are. Having a point of view, being able to articulate and defend it are really key traits for this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#5. What skills are helpful

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would shape the type of classes you would take. The goal would be to write something like this.

For the econ part, if you're a college student and can tell me the effects of quantitative easing on asset prices and the real economy and how its different in the US, Europe, Japan that's pretty good.

For the analysis, excel skills with Bloomberg and Python would be good. Basically making insights with lots of data.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, \*all this can be learned from the job\* so I would prioritize passion and ability to learn as things to demonstrate.

&amp;#x200B;

So what makes this answer particularly hoax-y is that half the information is entirely factually correct, and as you can now see I've edited a number of citations where you can actually find the information I included. Firstly, to go through the bibliography:

But onto the main points. 

The introductory paragraph is half true. Perdue (who is cited in the corrected citation) does indeed highlight similarities in Qing policy between its treatment of affairs in Xinjiang and on the coast during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but the point about Anglo-Kokandi links is pure bullshit.

The point about rhubarb is very muddled. For a time, rhubarb was both highly expensive and seen as a bit of a wonder drug in Europe (one of Marco Polo's high priorities was seeking out the regions where it grew) but by the time of the Opium War it was already cultivated in Europe. And yes, it is a laxative.

All but the last sentence of paragraph 2 is completely true. Chinese medical treatises insisted that people in other countries had diets that would cause them to die of constipation unless they regularly consumed rhubarb, and so when the Qing embargoed Russia or Kokand they would regularly cut down rhubarb quotas at other trade posts and crack down on rhubarb smugglers.

While Jāhangīr's revolt and the Kokandi invasion did happen, these were unrelated to rhubarb. Ditto for James Flint, Lord Macartney and Lord Amherst, who all travelled to Beijing in 1757, 1793 and 1816 respectively, but of course rhubarb was not their priority.

Coleridge didn't spark people's interest in Central Asia, but Manning did travel to Lhasa in 1811 and get expelled by a Manchu official who had previously been at Canton – see Platt, *Imperial Twilight*, for a brief narrative of the journey and how it fit into the Anglo-Chinese interaction before the Opium War broke out. Morris Robertson is a deliberate muddling of Manning's contemporary, the missionary Robert Morrison, whose son John Robert Morrison produced the first translation of a Protestant Bible into Chinese. Staunton and Wellington had indeed worked to defuse situations before 1839, but obviously not for rhubarb; Jardine and Macaulay did stir up trouble in 1839, and the reasoning I give isn't far off: Jardine was an opium smuggler, Macaulay was a racist. However, the key thing in 1839 was that the outrage over Lin Zexu's unprecedentedly violent handling of the merchants *in and of itself* caused sufficient uproar for even Staunton and Wellington to change tack. Not rhubarb. And the point about the similarities in the 1835 and 1842 treaties is one that is actually widely academically accepted, first iterated by Joseph Fletcher in Volume 10 of the *Cambridge History of China*, and since reiterated, among others, by Perdue (in di Cosmo 2009) and Millward (1998).

All the events of the epilogue – the Taiping War, Second Opium War, Tungan Revolt and Kokandi invasion – did happen at the times I said they did, but obviously an Anglo-Kokandi conspiracy did not exist, and in fact travellers were quite common: a large number of our sources for things going on in Kashgaria come from British observers.",True,False,False,,0,1554170357,,False,0,{},ejx49yu,False,t3_b7pwnk,False,True,t1_ejtf2s2,/r/AskHistorians/comments/b7pwnk/why_did_the_first_opium_war_happen/ejx49yu/,False,,1557249565,3,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0.0,

You will be fine, if you only pay via credit card or Paypal, but if you like to pay with a method, where you pay in cash you will have to pay procession fees on top of the price everytime (between 6-8%). Steam has these fees included in the 30% cut just like nearly every other store in the world, so the customer doesn't have to pay these. And Valve also knows that people in Eastern Europe and Asia love to pay with cash methods (wallet cards for example), so they also subsidize (idk if that word is the most accurate one) those things out of their own pocket so the customers can pay equally, so they will get 50$ for 50$.

I think though that doing something like a USA-Mexico open border policy would be difficult given the current political climate and the fact that Mexico would need to get its own affairs in order first.

Conversely, a lot of immigration restrictions were done on racist thought and not much else. Such as:

* The [Page Act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875) and [Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act), which was a reaction to Chinese immigrants coming to the US during the gold rush. This was followed up with the [Geary Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary_Act). 
*  The [Immigration Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917) and [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924), which again was done only for the purpose of restricting certain groups of people with no real valid reason. This was particularly devastating to those in Eastern Europe. The [quota](http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5078) for immigrants coming from Italy went from 200,000 a year to barely 4,000. The reason this didn't strain relations with Europe was due to the Great Depression, which made immigration less desirable.

It wasn't until the [Immigration Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965) that nation based quotas were abolished. The first form of amnesty came under the Reagan administration that was the [Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986) which granted amnesty to a few million illegal immigrants.

When kids move out of Armenia and go to the West (US/EU etc.) their views change. in the west, the military is seen as a career/job not a mandatory duty that every men must complete. 

Also these kids grow up with western benefits, better schooling and an opportunity for better job so it doesnt make sense for them to go to Armenia, spend 2 years busting their ass, risk getting killed by bullshit Azeris, fall back on school, work and social life.

Imagine a 2 year old kid who migrated to say Germany with his parents. When this kid (whose lived in Germany for 15 years) turns 18 you tell him that he has to give up his life in Germany and go spend 2 years serving in a conflict zone obviously he would rather stay in Germany. By the time this kid reaches the age of 27 there is no reason for him to move back and preeminently reside in Armenia other than because he was born there. 

Its also important to note that not only diasporans tried to avoid military service but mainland folks did as well. Especially during the previous gov. regime. The previous corrupt regime stole and plundered the armies supplies and they abused soldiers. Soldiers werent given proper uniforms, weapons or fed nutritious meals. 

Luckily after the revolution this is changing. Funds designated for the military are being properly spent on the military, corruption is being uprooted and soldiers are reporting that service conditions are much better. hopefully as more progress is made towards solving the NK conflict serving in the military will become less dangerous.

Any immediate future referendums on the matter must supplement, not undo, the result of the first, at least not for a considerable amount of time, a minimum of ten years usually. (see Quebec 1980 and 1995 referendum).

In my view, Brexit must be done in stages: Move to the EFTA as a temporary, develop an FTA with the EU that is mutually acceptable, then leave to ensure an orderly exit. That is one possible option, the other being no deal/WTO rules.

In brands that use continental EU sizing such as Chantelle, Simone Perele, Anita, Ulla Dessous, Gaia, Gorsenia, Triumph, etc the answer is yes, DDD is  the same as F. 

In brands that use UK sizing like Curvy Kate, Freya, Fantasie, Panache, Cleo, etc the answer is that UK-F is one cupsize larger than DDD or UK-E.  

In US sizing it also depends upon the brand. In standard US sizing (Wacoal, Goddess, Elila) F=DDD. In Torrid and Lane Bryant F is one cupsize larger than DDD. 

If you are shopping online in the USA, amazon. 

For in-store options look for independent boutiques or try Nordstrom or  Dillards.

In 2012 they blended some single casks of both malt and grain whisky and left them to marry and age for an additional 4 years.  Bottled in 2016 after a total maturation of 23 years.  Bottled at cask strength, 51.6% ABV.  Non-chill filtered and no added color.

&amp;nbsp;



**Nose:**  Nails it on the nose.  Vanilla.  Cream.  Powdered sugar.  Pudding.  Blackberries.  Strawberries.  Apples.  A bit of earth and just a hint of fish sauce.  Peanuts.  Herbs.

**Palate:**  Medium rich and creamy mouthfeel.  Loads of vanilla.  Custard.  Flan.  Apples.  Pears.  Apricots.

**Finish:**  Medium finish.  Still some sweetness and vanilla.  And a bit of apple as well.  But some spice and earth now too.  And herbs.  A bit of mint.  Some baking spices.  And marjoram.

**Score:** 90/100

&amp;nbsp;

This is really good.  More vanilla than just about any whisky I've ever tried, which is neat.  And creamy and light.  But not really very light.  Its a serious whisky.  Just a more classic one.  Not overpowering, not bombastic.  But delicious.  And well crafted, well balanced.  I'd love to drink this regularly.  And for the price they sell it for, I certainly would if I lived in Europe.  This was from a bottle split from a friend who had it shipped from Germany from one of his friends.  As far as I can tell, you can only buy it from the Cadenhead store directly.  Lucky for those who can go there easily, but for me, its a more rarefied treat.  I'll happily enjoy the rest of this bottle.

First of all you should know that PhD positions in the STEM fields Germany are almost always funded (and the theoretical self-sponsored option does not apply to foreigners). The formal application procedure starts with the PI posting the job (which is usually for a specific project) on their university's website and sometimes on job portals like Zeit online or academicpositions.eu. There's usually no such thing as the PI simply ""having funding"" and giving that money to you for your project. 

So, if you're looking for a PhD position in Germany, the first thing you should do is (continuously) keeping an eye on the job portals and applying for the positions you are interested in. 

The second thing you should do is, as you've already figured out, contact the PIs directly, as they can give you a lot more information, such as whether or not they are going to have open positions soon, or if they ""might"" have something soon. When you contact a PI, assume that you'll be working on a specific project of their own making, not your research idea, because that's how third-party-funding works. Reading some of their research before you contact them is usually a good idea. But you'll do that anyway -- how would you know whom to contact otherwise? So, after you've come up with a few PIs to contact, send them a short (1/2 A4) page e-mail stating who you are, what you've been doing, your interest in joining their group and a general research direction (not a specific project), inquire about whether there currently are or will be any opportunities for a new PhD student in the near future and attach your CV. 

The third thing you should do -- there are a lot of fellowships in Germany, so if a group that you're interested in doesn't have any immediate opportunities, you might be able to come to Germany with a fellowship, at least for a year or so. There's a database for international students that you should check out: https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?status=4&amp;origin=44&amp;subjectGrps=&amp;daad=&amp;q=&amp;page=1&amp;back=1 You should check if there are any that would be suitable for you. Of course one year is not enough to do a PhD, and this kind of funding is only temporary, but it would give the PI time to cook some funding, which means they would usually write a proposal for funds to continue the project after the fellowship runs out. Also in this case you should expect that the PI will make some suggestion and expect you to follow that suggestion.

[Finland has found the answer to homelessness. It couldn’t be simpler](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/finland-homelessness-rough-sleepers-britain)





&gt;**It turns out its solution is painfully simple and blindingly obvious: give homes to homeless people**. As Juha Kaakinen, who has led much of the work on “housing first” in Finland, explained to me when I met him in Helsinki, “this takes housing as a basic human right” rather than being conditional on engaging in services for addictions or mental health. 



&gt;This is fundamentally different to our model in the UK, where stable accommodation is only provided as a “reward” for engaging in treatment services. The problem with this is obvious if you stop and think about it: how do we expect people to address complex personal problems while exposed to the chaos of life on the streets?

&gt;Sceptics will argue that giving homes to homeless people is a recipe for disaster. **Aren’t we just subsidising addiction? Won’t we end up with huge bills when it all goes wrong? Don’t people need an incentive to get their lives back on track and engage in services?**

&gt;**Actually, no**. The evidence from Finland – as well as numerous other pilot schemes across the world – shows the opposite is true. 



&gt;When people are given homes:


&gt; - **homelessness is radically reduced**, 


&gt; - **engagement in support services goes up** and 



&gt; - **recovery rates from addiction are comparable to a “treatment first” approach** 



&gt; - Even more impressive is that there are **overall savings for government, as people’s use of emergency health services and the criminal justice system is lessened.**




&gt;**It turns out its solution is painfully simple and blindingly obvious: give homes to homeless people**




[How social housing can save the American city](https://theweek.com/articles/786944/how-social-housing-save-american-city)


&gt;**But what rent control does not do is provide a supply of new units. That's where social housing comes in.** This refers to government-owned housing that is open to all residents (contrary to American-style public housing, which is restricted to the poor). **This provides the needed housing supply, and in all market segments simultaneously — not just the luxury market**. Without the need for profit, overall rents could be lower — but with broad socioeconomic diversity among tenants, governments could still use ""social rents"" to pay for upkeep (no huge subsidies required) and cross-subsidize their tenants.




[Why America Needs More Social Housing](http://prospect.org/article/why-america-needs-more-social-housing)


&gt;**AMERICAN VISITORS TO Vienna are typically struck by the absence of homeless people on the streets.** And if they ventured around the city, they’d discover that there are no neighborhoods comparable to the distressed ghettos in America’s cities, where high concentrations of poor people live in areas characterized by high levels of crime, inadequate public services, and a paucity of grocery stores, banks, and other retail outlets.

&gt;Since the 1920s, **Vienna has made large investments in social housing** owned or financed by the government. But **unlike public housing in the United States, Vienna’s social housing serves the middle class as well as the poor, and has thus avoided the stigma of being either vertical ghettos or housing of last resort**. Every country in Western Europe has some version of social housing, but Vienna’s is by far the largest and most successful. It is typically ranked as one of the world’s most livable cities.

&gt;the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of a population, and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population.

The report points out that

&gt;the most likely changes in fertility and mortality rates for Europe and Japan are unlikely to counter population decline and population ageing over the next half century.

Given this scenario, the report explains that

&gt;Replacement migration was one among a number of possible policy responses that were considered.

The report further raises two salient points:

&gt;While orderly international migration can provide countries of origin with remittances and facilitate the transfer of skills and technology, it also may entail the loss of needed human resources. Similarly, international migration can provide countries of destination with needed human resources and talent, but may also give rise to social tensions.

The full title of the report is *Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations.* It's a briefing that was developed to help policy-makers understand a specific set of issues. There is no ""plan"" in the report - there aren't even any specific recommendations.

The report was discussed at an [Expert Group Meeting on Policy Responses to Population Ageing and Population Decline](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/expert-group/2/index.asp), and it's worth reading the responses to the report. The UK response from David Coleman questioned the demographic projects and recommended the UN Population Division widens the discussion beyond migration; the Russian response from Anatoly Vishnevsky accepted the projections but referred to the choice between decline and immigration as a choice between ""the lesser of two evils""; the EU response from Fotakis pointed out that

&gt;Different policy mixes can be considered in an effort to maintain the high welfare standards of the EU social models without harm neither for the European society nor for the developing countries. Besides, rapid and radical policy changes to either direction might imply increased transition costs and unpredictable social implications... assessing the needs of immigration for the European Union is a quite complicated issue that cannot be treated by taking only into account the demographic trends.

Almost all of the responses emphasized that an exclusive focus on migration as a solution was probably counter-productive, and that a broader range of policy issues needed to be explored in order to really address the two challenges of population ageing and population decline. And that was where the discussion ended.

D'après ce sondage, l'immigration arrive en tête des réponses les plus souvent données (23 % des réponses) à l'échelle de l'Europe.

Dans certains pays, les questions de pouvoir d'achat, de santé, de corruption ou de chômage sont jugées plus importantes.

Une tendance fidèle au dernier Eurobaromètre publié au mois de février pour le compte du Parlement européen.

&gt;En Europe de l'Est (Pologne, Slovaquie, Roumanie), la question migratoire arrive loin derrière les problématiques de santé et de corruption. Même chose en Hongrie, où le président nationaliste Viktor Orbàn multiplie pourtant les sorties contre les migrants. 

&gt;En Grèce et en Espagne, deux pays durement touchés par la crise économique et les mesures d'austérité, c'est le chômage qui arrive en tête des préoccupations. En Italie, c'est aussi la réponse qui est la plus souvent donnée, mais la peur de l'immigration y est plus présente (32 % des réponses). 

&gt;En revanche, en Allemagne, en Autriche ou en Belgique, l'immigration est le problème n°1 pour les personnes interrogées.

I'm not (necessarily, though I've got no problem with it personally) saying ""Hey, punch every Nazi you see!"" and I'm certainly not advocating for punching anyone you disagree with.

I'm saying that if we want to create and maintain a tolerant society, we CANNOT allow speech advocating for this level or type of intolerance. Allowing unchecked free speech without limit eventually leads to a society where tolerance itself is defeated by the intolerance.

&gt;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant...

 - Karl Popper, 1945.

We Americans largely have the idea that a person has the right to say whatever they want, regardless of how violent it is. Germany and other European countries, especially those deeply affected by the Nazi-led genocide, understand that there are some forms of speech that are too violent to be allowed--that hate speech is in and of itself a form of violence that, if allowed to flourish without check, will directly lead to mass physical violence.

&gt;Simulationsstudien bewegt sich der Verlust im UK zwischen 3,5% und 1,5% und im Durchschnitt **der EU-27-Länder zwischen 0,25% und 0,6%.**

DEU is Germany obviously but there is a different figure in the table for them and he says the EU isn't on the table, the 0.6 he's talking about is the worst case for the EU-27, best case for UK scenario.

He does seem to be comparing the *worst* case for the EU with the best case for the UK though, the worst cases for the UK (3,5% and 1,5%) are a lot worse than that and worse than for the EU (0,25% and 0,6%)- the UK gets hit *six times worse* than the EU does according to the simulation he linked. That's a huge difference.

The 0.5% for the UK is in only one out of four ""hard brexit"" scenarios, where the UK unilaterally allows tariff free access to the UK for all EU goods even while the EU places tariffs on UK goods. That's what that paper is analysing, but it's not clear that that would actually happen, it's their best possible / least damage hard Brexit scenario. All the others are far worse.

I also think this is only looking at domestic consumption- the effect on consumer prices. I think this fourth plan does work best for consumer prices, but at the expense of completely gutting British exports.

Finally- the author in this paper is NOT arguing for a hard Brexit, not even the least bad type, he is anti-Brexit. He is just analysing the scenarios. He lays this out as a ""least bad"" if hard Brexit is a precondition. At the end of the paper he says his aim with this is to show these are ALL bad, but that if forced with their back to the wall, the least bad one for the UK is that last one. What the author of that paper actually WANTS is (1) to cancel Brexit entirely, or (2) have a more constructive exit deal including keeping the UK in the customs union. He's absolutely not pro-Brexit at all, in another paper he wrote **“A hard Brexit is in no one’s interest and would cause irreperable political and economic damage.”**

It's a majority of the british *people* who are the nutters, utterly disconnected from economic reality, routinely *believing* daily mail headlines and wanting someone to blame for their failures in their own lives. 

It's probably better for the EU in the long run to be rid of them. It wasn't a healthy dynamic. 

On an unrelated note, gotta love some of the new political parties that have formed in the UK, the ones specifically for people who consider UKIP to be not racist enough. Some had a stand handing out flyers while shouting that we should no-deal. 

glance at the leaflet they're handing out, ""so... point 2? 'restore the rule of law'?, how exactly is the rule of law not in place right now"" 

""um uh du ummm umm "" (I think he was surprised anyone actually asked) ""Um....Well you can see it!"" ""see what?"" ""you can see it on the street around us every day"" ""?"" ""Muslims!"" 

because apparently ""rule of law"" is code-speak for ""get rid of the muslims"" for the brexiters.

It is native to North America west of the Rocky Mountains (California to British Columbia, east to Idaho and Nevada) but has in recent times expanded its range to eastern North America, to include Connecticut and New Hampshire, and has become an accidental introduced species in parts of Europe.

This species is a member of the insect family Coreidae, or leaf-footed bugs, which also includes the similar Leptoglossus phyllopus and Acanthocephala femorata, both known as the ""Florida leaf-footed bug"". Western conifer seed bugs are sometimes colloquially called stink bugs.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON/SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - The Trump administration is intensifying measures to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers crossing into the United States from Mexico, officials said on Monday, including sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U.S. courts. 

&gt; Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency will speed up the reassignment of 750 officers to parts of the border dealing with the largest numbers of immigrants, a shift the administration first announced last week. 

&gt; Nielsen was cutting short a visit to Europe and flying back to Washington from London to personally oversee enforcement actions, and would visit the border later in the week, a Homeland Security official said late on Monday. She had been due to also travel to Sweden and take part in a meeting of G7 security officials in Paris. 

&gt; U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to close the border this week if Mexico does not stop a surge of people, often traveling as families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Closing the border would potentially disrupt millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade. His aides doubled down on the threat on Sunday but offered no specific details or timeline. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2CJe9fh) 

&gt; One policy put in place earlier this year to return asylum seekers to Mexico, called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), will be “immediately” expanded by “hundreds of additional migrants per day above current rates,” Nielsen said in a statement on Monday. 

&gt; As of March 26, approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico since the program began in late January, a Mexican official said last week. 

&gt; People who have been returned to Mexico to wait are struggling to find attorneys and receive notice of their proceedings in U.S. courts, rights advocates said. 

&gt; Trump administration officials say the MPP is a way to address the failings of the current system, which they claim encourages illegal immigration. Families that claim asylum are often released into the United States because of limits on how long children can be held in detention, allowing them to stay for years while their cases move through a backlogged immigration court system even though many claims are ultimately denied. 

&gt; The administration is hoping policies of deterrence will reduce the number of people who turn themselves in to U.S. border agents, overwhelming the capacity of processing centers along the southern border. 

&gt; CBP estimated last month that some 100,000 migrants would be apprehended or encountered at the border in March, the highest level in a decade, forcing agents to temporarily house migrants for processing in an outdoor enclosure under an international bridge in El Paso, Texas. That overflow site was shut down on Sunday after being used for a month. 

&gt; The total number of immigrants being released by U.S. immigration authorities in El Paso is averaging 500-600 per day, said Ruben Garcia, executive director of Annunciation House, which coordinates migrant releases with U.S. immigration authorities. Annunciation House is preparing for that total to rise to up to 1,100 during the current surge, Garcia said. 

&gt; Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central Americans passing through its territory to the United States. He said the root causes of the phenomenon must be tackled. 

&gt; In a move Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said would be counterproductive, the U.S. State Department cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador after Trump accused them, without providing evidence, of having “set up” migrant caravans and sending them north. 

&gt; The Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment about the expansion of MPP, and it was not clear to what extent Mexico was forewarned. In the past, Mexico has said it was accepting returned asylum seekers for humanitarian reasons although it opposes the policy. 

&gt; Shelters in major Mexican border cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are already at capacity because of the increase in asylum seekers in recent months and the U.S. policy of allowing only a few dozen people per day to ask for asylum at ports of entry. 

&gt; Last week, San Diego immigration judge Scott Simpson heard from the first Central American families that were returned to Mexico under th...

I'm not saying that we should behave EXACTLY like Asians, but where is the shame of taking inspiration where we see another group of people succeeding?
I know very well that we live in a complex society and that e everything isn't black or what but in shades of grey, I'm not naive.

But I'm a little tired of reading reasons why we can't succeed instead of focusing on what can actually be done to get to the top, I just wasn't raised that way and I see the difference compared to childhood friends with that mindset.
Every time I give a friend a way to do better and I hear ""yes but"", it kills me inside.
I wasn't rich, I didn't even study for long because I hated school, I don't know my father, so according to statistics I should be a the bottom of the social ladder.
Family teached me to say fuck to statistics and I can't thank them enough.

Let me give you a very concrete example to show you why we can't blame EVERYTHING on white people.
I'm currently in Mauritius, the majority of the population is from Indian descent. The country was colonized by European and Indians were basically paid slaves. After they became independent, they made this island one of the richest countries in Africa, citys here are basically like in Europe.
Before that I was in Madagascar, very similar history but a majority of the population is of African descent. They sold all their Ressources to private companies, destroyed their own environment and the infrastructures have been left to rot.
How do you explain that? You can't say it's because of racism, most of white people left both country in the same situation after they left.

The first step to solve a problem is to be able to self reflect, not blaming other at all costs. 
We should look up instead of pulling each other to the bottom.

&gt; which one sounds more like LVG?

I'll tell you what LVG sounds like:

&gt; But Van Gaal has been scouting Didier Deschamps’ recent addition to his full French squad for the last 12 months and opted to swoop when Monaco were KO’d in Europe by Valencia last week with Martial also on the radar of other clubs.

https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/anthony-martial-inside-story-manchester-9962483

&gt; United would have preferred to move for Martial next summer. However Van Gaal needed to strengthen his forward line and he was also conscious that Chelsea, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid were all interested in the player. Once Monaco were knocked out of the Champions League this cleared the way for the deal. While there is a recognition at the club that Martial may represent a gamble, Van Gaal believes he has the potential to be world class.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/01/manchester-united-sign-monaco-forward-anthony-martial

If you know anything about LVG and his career, his vision of young talent, Martial is *exactly* the sort of player he would go after. At the time, everybody thought he was crazy for signing young, very expensive talent instead of a proven veteran.

And while LVG can and does work with both, Martial fits the LVG profile to the T. As such, he proved himself immediately in his debut.

Now, you can google ""Martial LVG"" and read how much the Man United fanbase appreciates Van Gaal getting Martial: the fans have credited Van Gaal many times and have thanked him repeatedly and profusely for it.

[],WhiteSatanicMills,1475931224.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_11z0jd,False,"&gt;Scotland is extremely lucky because it's the best location in the UK to develop renewables, and one of the best in Europe. We currently meet 68% of our energy needs with renewables. This sets us up for an incredibly bright future.

Scotland has a lot of renewable energy because the UK subsidises it across the UK, and Scotland has many of the best sites to install wind power. But that's a conjunction of two circumstances, Scotland's position and UK money. Without the subsidies from UK consumers, Scotland would have a lot less renewable energy.

&gt;You're doing the dishonest thing and pretending, once again, that we're being subsidised because of the UK's generosity.

Scotland isn't being subsidised by renewables levies (not directly, anyway). The subsidies are paid to companies that own the renewable generators. 

&gt;For one, the Scottish taxpayer also pays for renewables

Yes. But Scotland pays for about 8.4% of UK renewables yet hosts about 28% of UK renewables (in terms of generation). That's why independence would be such a problem for renewables in Scotland. Where would the subsidies come from? By charging everybody in Scotland 3 times as much?

&gt;the UK knows they need this to help meet their energy shortage and it's cheaper for them than importing.

No, it's much more expensive than generating by other means. Wind energy in the UK is paid 11 - 12p per KWH including subsidies. The wholesale price of electricity is about 5p. The advantage for the rUK is that it would stop paying the subsidies to Scottish renewable generators but still buy the imports at market price. And if the imports weren't available, it would simply burn a bit more gas. 

&gt;If Scotland becomes independent, the excess energy we produce and could export would vastly offset the cost of renewable subsidies

No. You can't offset costs by paying 11p and selling for 5p. The more you generate at that price the more it costs. 

There is a reason electricity bills are highly correlated with the amount of installed wind/solar power. Germany and Denmark lead Europe with the proportion of wind/solar they have, and they also have the highest electricity prices in Europe. That's because their own consumers pay the subsidies for all the electricity they produce, even the exports.

&gt;You guys have spent years claiming oil was worthless,

The only people I have ever seen claim oil is worthless are Scottish nationalists. Oil, like electricity, is worth what the market will pay for it. The UK market will pay 5p a KWH for electricity. UK wind generators are paid 11p a KWH for electricity. That doesn't make their electricity worthless, but it does mean government has to force consumers to subsidise it. After independence, the UK government would not continue to force UK consumers to pay subsidies to generators in Scotland. That means for every unit of electricity Scotland exported to rUK, UK consumers would pay 5p, but Scottish generators would expect to be paid 11p.

But there are caveats, of course. What we normally think of medieval Europe wasn't the image we would find upon arriving on Hungary. The Hungarian army had little in the way of knights, preferring to use light cavalry. ""Castles"" in the way we normally picture them didn't exist. Instead, fortifications were made of earth and wood, and many cities and towns didn't have any whatsoever. Peter Jackson (the historian) notes how a source from the era describes the Hungarians having ""almost no city protected by walls""

By contrast, during that same invasion that nearly annihilated Hungary, a Croatian stone castle withstood everything the Mongols throwed at it, and then some. 

So, the King set hard at work about reforming his army and his defenses. It was clear that he had to move away from wooden castles and light cavalry, so he encouraged fully armored knights and promoted the construction of castles. He invited foreign experts and tried to hire crossbowmen. Settlers that fought mounted and armoured would be given a sort of nobility. Hungary went from having 10 stone castles to 66.

A few years after their victory on Hungary, the Mongols tried to pressure the King to lend them 25% of their army to invade Europe and a marriage alliance. Hungary refused. And then refused again. And again. When they finally invaded, the Hungarians were ready. Garrisons from the castles sallied out to periodically harass the invaders while every bit of sustenance from the land was hoarded in the castle or set to the torch. The Mongols failed to take a castle, and after the constant harassment and many skirmishes, were defeated in open battle by the Hungarian army. On the way back, they were also ambushed by local forces, and again suffered more casualties.

Fun fact: the war was not good for the Hungarian king, politically speaking.

By having low taxes and high spending. Scotland pays lower taxes than the UK average and spends significantly more.

&gt;According to it's figures, Northern Ireland is the most heavily subsidised country in the EU.

The error in this is in comparing what's effectively a region to sovereign states. I doubt very much that NI is the most subsidised region in the EU.

&gt;If the rest of Ireland was part of the UK, you can sure as hell bet the UK would claim that about them too. Instead, Ireland currently has the second highest per captia GDP in all of the EU.

Ireland's GDP isn't an accurate measure of Ireland's economy. Even the Irish government recognise this and have come up with a new figure, “modified gross national income”: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_gross_national_income  
https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-nie/nie2017/mgni/

If Ireland were part of the UK with its current revenue and spending it wouldn't have a significant deficit. 

&gt;In any event, even it's supporters admit it tells us nothing about the finances of an independent Scotland (just an estimate of our income vs the current share of debts that Westminster allocates us).

Of course it doesn't tell you what the finances of an independent Scotland would be. An independent country couldn't sustain a deficit that large. It would have to make cuts and increase taxes. Every time I have asked a nationalist who makes this point to give examples of the £10 billion in cuts and tax increases he would make, I haven't received a reply.

Of course, there would be knock on effects from all those cuts and tax increases, and from the effects on trade, and the costs of transitioning to independence, that would make the figures worse still. 

&gt;So when the UK government decides to do things like build an £80 billion HS2 railway from London to Leeds, we're allocated a portion of the spending

No. GERS is produced by the Scottish government. They decide what counts as Scottish spending. In the case of HS2, the Scottish government believes 2% of the benefit will accrue to Scotland, so they allocate 2% of the cost to Scotland. 

&gt;You're on here every day telling us we're too wee, too poor, too stupid,

That's another of those phrases, like oil being ""worthless"", or ""SNP bad"", that's only ever uttered by nationalists. Scotland isn't ""too wee, too poor, too stupid"". It does receive a lot of support from the rest of the UK, and is highly integrated with the rest of the UK, so would be a lot poorer if independent. 

&gt;I don't believe for one second that Scotland couldn't go it alone and be a successful European nation

Of course it could. It's just losing £10 billion a year from the rest of the UK, and about £14 billion a year in trade with the rest of the UK, would make it a lot less successful than it is now. 

&gt;and I certainty don't believe that we rely on the benevolent generosity of our kind and selfless Tory overlords, and wouldn't be able to create a fairer society by getting rid of them once and for all.

Perusteita ei sen sijaan ole vihan kohdistamiselle niihin epätoivoisiin ihmisiin, jotka hakevat turvaa ja uutta elämää kurjuudesta kärsivän kotimaansa ulkopuolella. Tuhansien ihmisten hukkuminen Välimereen vuosittain on koko Euroopan häpeä. Kansainvälisellä yhteistyöllä ongelma olisi paremmin hallittavissa.

Ne Korkmanin haukkumat populistit nimenomaan laittoivat tämän ongelman hallintaan. 

""Vastuulliset puolueet"" veivät merestä pelastetut Italiaan (ja sallivat ei-valtiollisten järjestöjen tehdä samoin), mikä lisäsi Eurooppaan pyrkivien määrää ja hukkumisia. 

Kuolemat Keskisen Välimeren reitillä Italiaan ovat vähentyneet melkein 70% sen jälkeen, kun politiikkaa on tiukennettu ([153 kuolemaa 2019 alusta](https://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-10308-2019-deaths-reach-234), kun taas 358 vuosi sitten vastaavana ajankohtana ja [490 kaksi vuotta sitten](https://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-11636-2018-deaths-reach-462)).

Tätä ei olisi tehty ilman ""populistien"" kannatuksen nousua. Jos vastuulliset puolueet tekevät em. virheitä, niin se johtaa ""populistien"" kannatuksen nousuun.

Visitó también la basílica del Santo Sepulcro, en una agenda poco común para los mandatarios.    

Redacción JERUSALEM

EFE

El presidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, visitó ayer la basílica del Santo Sepulcro, el lugar más importante para el cristianismo, y el Muro de las Lamentaciones, el sitio de culto más sagrado para el judaísmo, en la ciudad vieja de Jerusalén, en la parte ocupada de la urbe, por lo que dignatarios internacionales no suelen incluirlos en su agenda oficial.   Bolsonaro hizo una primera parada en el Santo Sepulcro, lugar significativo para él como creyente, y luego se desplazó al Muro de las Lamentaciones, a escasa distancia del templo cristiano.   El ultraderechista brasileño era católico pero en 2016 fue bautizado como evangélico en el río Jordán, un recuerdo al que hizo alusión en varias ocasiones a su llegada ayer a Israel en un discurso plagado de referencias religiosas.   El primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, le acompañó al Muro, el último vestigio en pie de la plataforma sobre la que se levantaba el Templo de Herodes, destruido por los romanos en el año 70 d.C y que reemplazó al templo de Salomón, que destruyeron los babilonios en el año 587 a.C.

EL DATO  Donald Trump fue el primer presidente norteamericano en llegar al Muro.Los primeros ministros y titulares de Exteriores europeos no suelen visitar este recinto, ocupado desde la Guerra de los Seis Días de 1967, o lo hacen como parte de una visita privada, aunque en el caso de Bolsonaro lo incluyó como parte de su agenda oficial en Israel, lo que desató protestas palestinas.   El secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Mike Pompeo, también viajó recientemente a la región y se convirtió en el representante de mayor rango de su país en visitar oficialmente -y acompañado por el Primer Ministro- el Muro de las Lamentaciones.   Donald Trump, a quien Bolsonaro profesa una abierta admiración, al igual que Netanyahu, se convirtió en 2017 en el primer presidente estadounidense en activo en visitar el Muro de las Lamentaciones, aunque en aquel momento evitó ir acompañado de autoridades israelíes para no dañar el consenso histórico de Washington de no reconocer la ocupación por parte de Israel de la parte oriental de Jerusalén.

First, my mistake, I put £10 billion and £14 billion and added it up to £25 billion. I meant £24 (and I thought that's what I'd written).
The Scottish government puts the fiscal transfer at £10 billion a year. Research published by the Fraser of Allander institute puts the cost to Scotland of being outside the UK but with both in the EU at more than 8% of GDP (which works out at a bit more than £14 billion).

&gt;For example, we pool and share up until the point it no longer fits your purpose, then suddenly we actually keep all our income.

Sorry, I don't understand. Scotland pools and shares as part of the UK. It wouldn't if independent.

&gt;Any assets we have are actually bad and drain the UK.

Can you explain what you mean because this isn't something I've ever said.

&gt;If we have something it's subsidised,

All renewable energy in the UK is subsidised. I'm sorry if that upsets you, but it's a fact nonetheless. We pay getting on for £10 billion a year in subsidies for it. 

Your whole post is a straw man argument against a summary of my opinions that are actually your own opinions, not mine. I point out that renewable energy is subsidised (which is a simple, easily verifiable fact) and instead of addressing that, you say I complain that everything Scotland has is subsidised.

Your hairline would probably be easy to fix. You can do some research and find out what haircuts would work with your hairline and your headshape and trust me everyone has something that works for them perfectly. I've lost a lot of hair at 24 years old. So i keep it really short and my head shape is perfect for it so it works really good. My older brother prefers to shave his head completely and people love it. Read about what haircut would work for you and find the perfect cut through trial and error.

And not just the haircut but all of your grooming and your fashion choices can help you get rid of that ""school shooter"" or ""child molester"" image. Again, i don't believe it's that bad in any way. But if it still bothers you, you can fix it. I'm a big, brown, bald, hairy middle eastern guy living in europe and no one thinks i look like a terrorist or anything like that. Sometimes i even rock a bushy beard and still when i asked my friends if i look like a terrorist they laughed and said ""not even close"" because i choose my clothes and do my grooming very carefully. My bushy beard is never messy or dirty. My haircut is always fresh. Most of my clothes have a softer look. This wasn't always like this. A year ago people would be afraid of me. For the last year i did a lot of research about men's fashion and rebuilt my wardrobe. People started threating me differently, i even got a compliment on my outfit for the first time in my life a couple days ago.

When it comes to your height, again i don't think they would joke about it if it was really bad. But depending on your age it might be something you have to just accept and live with. My height is pretty average but most people around me are pretty tall so i look short. Does it bother me? Of course. But what can i do about it? No way i'm gonna get any taller at this point there's no technology. So fuck it. I'm not gonna let it make me depressed. If i let everything i can't control make me feel depressed i would be dead years ago.

Another funny story. I have this not so close friend and i met him like 6 months ago and we've met like 5 times. The last time i met him i realized he was like 15 cm's shorter than me. Which is funny because before that every time i pictured him in my mind i thought he was taller than me. This is because he's a very confident person. He doesn't let his height become a big deal. And out of the 5 times we went out together he went home with a girl 3 times. Different girls each time.

So far, for the past three weeks I've saved up about 40 EUR. Is it worth beginning to trade, considering the low amount of money I own? I'm not looking for huge profits, but if I can make something out of what I have, well, I'll be happy about it (it's not like anyone will ever come to me giving free money - so a tiny profit is still profit). I have a limited knowledge on how the market works, I'm still learning stuff. I thought about this a week ago and I've read some articles, had a friend explain some stuff to me, watched some YouTube videos trying to understand the basics of economics and trading. I know I still have **a lot** to learn.

I've learned a bit about Options, CFDs, ETFs but I cannot figure out how options work. I've read and read and watched videos on it, but I somehow get lost at some point. I have a demo account on a trading website, and I still can't seem to get how options work, I still lose money. I wanted to trade Options (not sure if using the word ""trading correctly here), as they hold more reward (and more risk as far as I know).

So, would it be possible to earn a little something over the course of, let's say a week, or a month considering the low amount of money? Would I be better off just doing something else with them and forget about trading (at least until I can get a job and afford to invest more) ?

Like ""I can't immediately think of how you might estimate a living wage SO IT'S A LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY"" get over yourself.

There are plenty of ways of estimating costs of living indexes. Look it up.

&gt;  If I own a small neighborhood grocery store, and I hire neighborhood teens to bag items – why should I be forced to pay them 15 bucks an hour to do that? The job isn't worth that much, and I'm just trying to help the neighborhood kids. 

I see ""ignorance 101"" is leaking.

Walmart isn't a small local store - here in civilisation, Europe, there are scales of sizes to deal with this issue.

And stop belittling someone's job to ""just bagging groceries"" - a shop assistant has other duties, they are in there all the time. Stocktaking, stacking shelves, taking out rubbish, organising, checking dates etc.

it's all stuff that needs to be done.

If the job is very simple and can be done quickly - then it only takes an hour, fine pay $15.

&gt; Not only is the amount of money I'm paying them not worth the labor, but I most likely won't be able to afford to hire as many, or give as many hours.

Then don't hire them. Or just hire one on a living wage.

I generally don't consider Europe (including UK) to be a sinking ship. There was a brief period in history when European national states got really powerful because they augmented themselves with colonies. Well, we don't have them anymore. And the fact that Europe and especially Uk was powerful between 1950-2000 is mostly because India and China were just super fucked up places. 

Europe is now not doing bad, the others merely catch up. But so do many countries in Europe. Ireland, Poland, Slovak Republic are Economical success stories since they entered the EU. For example, the region around Bratislava became one of the three most prosperous regions in Europe. People catch up to Western life standard. And I think it is also to be expected that China and India catch up. You cannot expect that a country with 70 Mio people can on the long run remain more powerful than a country with 1 Bio inhabitants without occupying it or fighting it.

 Em entrevista Ã **Folha**, o parlamentar, que comanda a terceira maior bancada da CÃ¢mara, com 38 deputados, disse que o representante de Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) estÃ¡ isolado.

 âNÃ£o tem um lÃ­der que converse com ele [Vitor Hugo]. NÃ£o vi ele nem no plenÃ¡rio mais. Quando tentou voo mais alto, fez patacoada. Dizem que pediu desculpa no privado. Mas faz no pÃºblico, tem que se desculpar no pÃºblicoâ, lembrando o episÃ³dio em que Vitor Hugo enviou mensagens com crÃ­ticas Ã velha polÃ­tica em um grupo de WhatsApp do PSL. â

   
 Em seu terceiro mandato na CÃ¢mara, Lira vive pela primeira vez o cenÃ¡rio de nÃ£o compor o governo. Assim como outros partidos, o PP nÃ£o ganhou vaga nos ministÃ©rios de Jair Bolsonaro. O deputado alagoano Ã© um dos que lideram o movimento de crÃ­tica e incompreensÃ£o sobre a ânova polÃ­ticaâ, expressÃ£o utilizada pelo presidente e recÃ©m-eleitos.  
   
 âQual Ã© a nova polÃ­tica? Ã a polÃ­tica da rede social? Os mais carentes vÃ£o receber as transformaÃ§Ãµes pelas redes sociais? O velho Ã© tudo que nÃ£o presta? O que Ã© que tem de novo atÃ© agora? Em trÃªs meses, muitos problemas. Ã isso o novo? A gente tem tido muita parcimÃ´nia e paciÃªnciaâ, acrescentou.

 Lira tambÃ©m disse ser obrigaÃ§Ã£o de Bolsonaro a [articulaÃ§Ã£o para a reforma da PrevidÃªncia](https://painel.blogfolha.uol.com.br/?p=30400) e que os deputados ""nÃ£o sÃ£o empregados do governo para ter que aprovar o que ele manda.â  
   
 âEm 30 anos de mandato, eu nunca vi uma matÃ©ria com uma importÃ¢ncia dessa sem apoio determinante de conversas por parte do governo com o Congresso para formar uma base.â

 O centrÃ£o, aglomerado de partidos que nÃ£o se alinharam automaticamente ao Planalto, jÃ¡ declarou que nÃ£o tem acordo com a proposta da PrevidÃªncia do ministro Paulo Guedes (Economia). 

 Na semana passada, o grupo se posicionou, com veto as alteraÃ§Ãµes no BPC (benefÃ­cio pago a idoso carente) e nas regras de aposentadoria rural.

 O lÃ­der do PP afirmou ainda que o ministro Onyx Lorenzoni (Casa Civil)[ tem se esforÃ§ado na articulaÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/em-crise-onyx-vai-a-camara-e-propoe-pacto-de-convivencia.shtml), mas nÃ£o tem conseguido resultado. âTem feito esforÃ§o, mas nÃ£o tem avanÃ§o. NÃ£o conseguiu nada. JÃ¡ era pra ter a base resolvida. Ele estÃ¡ sozinhoâ, declarou, [elogiando Joice Hasselmann (PSL-SP)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/chegara-a-hora-de-baixar-o-tom-nas-redes-afirma-joice-sobre-atuacao-de-bolsonaro.shtml), lÃ­der do governo no Congresso, a quem chamou de âapagadora de incÃªndioâ. 

 O parlamentar disse ter visto em frases recentes de Bolsonaro a tentativa de demonizar a polÃ­tica.âEle [Bolsonaro] deu uma [declaraÃ§Ã£o sobre a prisÃ£o do [ex-presidente Michel] Temer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/prisao-de-temer-e-melhor-noticia-para-bolsonaro-em-tempos.shtml), que a articulaÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica foi a causa. Ele quis demonizar a articulaÃ§Ã£o polÃ­tica. Sem articulaÃ§Ã£o, o governo nÃ£o me convence e eu nÃ£o convenÃ§o eles.â  
   
 ResponsÃ¡vel pela indicaÃ§Ã£o de aliados para cargos em outras gestÃµes, Lira defendeu a prÃ¡tica, mas disse nÃ£o ter feito nenhum pedido ao atual governo.  
   
 âPor que se brigava por cargos? Ã simples: porque, licitamente, atravÃ©s dos cargos, vocÃª levava transformaÃ§Ã£o para os estados. Mas, agora, nÃ£o preciso mais desse caminhoâ, completou, lembrando da recente aprovaÃ§Ã£o do orÃ§amento impositivo.  
   
 â[O orÃ§amento impositivo] Ã o fim do toma-lÃ¡-dÃ¡-cÃ¡, definitivamente. Agora vai ficar muito mais confortÃ¡vel para o governo. Era sempre um Congresso de muita parceria e que deixava o Executivo muito Ã vontade. Isso nÃ£o faz bem para a democracia.â

 A aprovaÃ§Ã£o foi vista como a segunda derrota do governo no Congresso neste ano. A primeira foi em fevereiro, quando os deputados derrubaram um decreto do governo que alterava a Lei de Acesso Ã InformaÃ§Ã£o âo presidente teve de recuar e revogou a medida.   
   
 Sobre a recente [briga entre o presidente da CÃ¢mara, Rodrigo Maia, e ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/tregua-entre-bolsonaro-e-maia-e-vista-com-descredito-dentro-do-congresso.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/tregua-entre-bolsonaro-e-maia-e-vista-com-descredito-dentro-do-congresso.shtml), disse que nÃ£o hÃ¡ vencedor, por ser ruim para o paÃ­s, mas que o Congresso saiu fortalecido e mostrou seu poder.  
   
 âSe quiser, e nÃ³s nÃ£o queremos, o Poder Legislativo tem capacidade de fazer transformaÃ§Ãµes muito fortes e a gente quer sempre usar essa forÃ§a para fazer o bem. A gente nÃ£o quer, no momento de ser emparedado, revidar. Isso Ã© o que de pior pode acontecer.â  
   
 Para Lira, o governo tem que dar sinais de qual caminho vai traÃ§ar, para ganhar confianÃ§a.âNÃ£o hÃ¡ sinal nenhum. Se alguÃ©m souber, me avisa. As teses sÃ£o ainda eleitorais. NÃ³s [deputados do centro] estamos inseridos ou nÃ³s vamos ser a periferia? Para onde nÃ³s vamos? Ã isso que eu quero saber. Porque aÃ­ eu posso decidir se estou dentro desse caminho ou se estou foraâ, disse.

 Ele afirmou que hÃ¡ no Congresso preocupaÃ§Ã£o com um golpe de Estado. âHÃ¡ pessoas como o professor Olavo de Carvalho, que tem muita influÃªncia e prega a ruptura institucional no Brasil. Tem gente dentro do Planalto que prega a mesma coisa. Causa preocupaÃ§Ã£o e alerta. Nosso maior bem Ã© a democracia e tem que imperar.â  
   
 Sobre os filhos do presidente, disse que âo problema Ã© o vereador [Carlos Bolsonaro], que nÃ£o tem contribuÃ­do para que o Brasil tenha calma.âAlvo de trÃªs denÃºncias do MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico, duas rejeitadas, e lÃ­der de uma das legendas mais citadas durante a Lava Jato, Arthur Lira fez crÃ­ticas Ã operaÃ§Ã£o e atacou Rodrigo Janot, ex-procurador-geral da RepÃºblica.  
   
 ""Todos os partidos cometeram erros. Todos. Todos. Porque todos tiveram pessoas que erraram. Os erros tÃªm de ser apurados com coerÃªncia. Janot nÃ£o agiu com isenÃ§Ã£o. A Lava Jato tem acertos, mas tem erros inadmissÃ­veis. Acabou com a reputaÃ§Ã£o de muita gente boa. Meu partido foi o patinho feio dessa histÃ³ria. O Janot quase acabou com a gente.â

2) 90% of any academic research done on this topic is critically flawed.

3) Men-at-arms made up a monumentally small portion of the French army at Agincourt. Hell, their cavalry numbered less than 1k. The English launched their campaign with 12k men...

&gt; plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines

Right, arrows are ineffective at distance. This is exactly why this belief that archers sent volley after volley is utter bullshit.

&gt; under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as ""a terrifying hail of arrow shot""

Again, bullshit. Pintoin was known for embellishment in his writing. Also, he specifically wrote that it was the arrogance of the French men-at-arms in this very act that led to their defeat and capture. 

&gt; with some suggesting that arrows could not penetrate, especially the better quality steel armour, but others suggesting arrows could penetrate, especially the poorer quality wrought iron armour

This is irrelevant as the majority of armies of the time were comprised of lightly armored conscripts. There were no standing militaries in Europe during this time and the majority of the French forces were coated in gambeson and a helmet. This is documented in your very quote...

&gt; Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields

&gt; Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range

Again, another example for why the idea of volley shot is nonsense.

This is simple vector math. Your vertical vector is the acceleration due to gravity. How then do you maximize your shot range? You could fire up (volley), but that removes the entire effectiveness of the weapon. Or you can shoot at level. Increase the acceleration on the arrow (higher draw weight on the bow and force supplied over greater duration; as would expect from a full compass draw of the English warbow). Make beefy arrows to absorb that force. Arrows flex on launch. Minimizing that warping minimizes drag. Ensure flight stability with proper fletching. All of this combined means that range is extended along the horizontal vector. Yes, the warbow increased range, range of shooting *at level*. This is why it was so effective. It allowed skilled archers to shoot accurately at level, while extending the range of that beyond that of their enemies.

Every sensible economist knows that adding barriers to trade and investment weakens economies.  Brexit is a barrier to trade and investment.   It's true we could set all (or many) tariffs to zero in the event of no-deal; but a degree of trade protectionism can benefit industries, like, say agriculture and the car industry.  There are also issues to do with regulations of products and services; we'll most likely have to align with our biggest trading partner on these issues, say, the EU, but will have little say on the regulations made, which is a deep shame.  I used to work with people that have contributed to CE standards through the committee process, and it looks like that after Brexit, these contributions will no longer be possible.

&gt; As such, unless there's a very large margin for remain, it's likely that leave would win another referendum.

I have to agree with you on this, while I support the idea of a 2nd referendum, I view the risk of such a referendum returning a Leave result again as moderately high.  Especially as opinion polls on Brexit have at best shifted by 5-10%.

What does that ultimately mean, if not something linguistic?  Look, I agree with the moral significance of the distinction empiricists are trying to create (remember, every linguistic act is a moral performance), but there's no need to misorder an ontology.

It does indeed serve a myriad of social purposes to have many of these distinctions (nested moral histories), but not when we end up reifying the declarative mode.  When we do that, we create bureaucracies that tyrannize the human.

&gt;The concept of ‘race’ may be socially constructed, but it has deep ramifications for individuals and society; there is plenty of HBD literature on that.

Oh, sure.  I'm the first to confront leftists on the other side of the question that the HBDers are referring to something stubbornly real.  Much of HBD is nothing but the result of _trying to falsify_ these null hypotheses, and yet failing to.  The results must be reckoned with somehow, if not in a specific way, another.

&gt;Just as ‘IQ’ is a social construct to you in the same sense, that doesn’t mean it is necessarily subsequent to language

Oh, but it has to be.  Actually, there is even a link between IQ and literacy.  It's very difficult to test IQ on illiterate peoples, even with Progressive Matrices, as the notion of conception as itself an object for consciousness becomes more illuminated post-literacy.  In that sense, the relativists are kind of right in their criticisms of IQ as Eurocentric; it just would be that useful information is still be generated (e.g. how linguistically compatible a group is with us).

&gt;you couldn’t even have this conversation with someone of a sufficiently low IQ; that person couldn’t use language

Couldn't use language as intelligently, yes.

&gt;unless they first exist out there in the real world

'Out there' is a historically European concept, especially English.  I'm not saying that by now many other cultures don't practice many of the same mindsets, but Europeans blazed that psychological trail.

&gt;but that doesn’t mean that what I care about or my motivations for caring are not grounded in a reality that exists outside of me

It means there's no sense of talking about these things apart from the way you are morally and linguistically connected to them.  Reifying is nothing but a mismatching of frames, the use of a frame out of total context.  People are more susceptible to it the more extended a scene becomes, hence what has happened to our people.

&gt;I do think there is such a thing as ‘beauty’ and ‘order’ and ‘progress’ which is not socially constructed or contained in language

Why would it be threatening if it was socially constructed?  It doesn't mean it's not real.  In GA, we also interchange 'social construction' with 'sacral construction', as collective intentionality is the same mode as Divinity.

&gt;If a society constructs decay to be beautiful (as it often does now), then that is deeply sick, not just an ‘alternative’ or ‘different’ state of affairs.

We're not relativists in the colloquial sense.  We don't think it's possible for a society to coherently do that.

(2) Trindade - Trilha para praia do Sono e Antiguinhos - Passeio bem fácil, mas as praias são espetaculares. Técnicamente é no RJ haha, mas é pertinho da divisa.

(3) Caraguatatuda - Trilha do Poço Fundo - Trilha tranquila que vai para uma cachoeira com um lugar gostoso pra nadar. Precisa de guia.

(4) Ubatuba - Trilha das Sete Praias - Essa trilha sai da Praia da Lagoinha (que é top por si só) e passa por várias praias lindas até dar a volta no costão e chegar na praia de Fortaleza. Faz sem guia mesmo, só cuidado que tem cobra demais.

(5) Não sei se curte montanha, mas se quiser variar recomendo a trilha da pedra da Onça, em São Francisco Xavier.

Obs: Como cidade e também pelas praias ao redor, Ubatuba é melhor.

The Observer magazine has been hiring Opinium Research to do a general political poll every two weeks since the end of January. Among the many questions asked was ""If the Commons cannot agree on a deal do you think we should leave with ‘no deal’ or delay Article 50 and hold a public vote on what to do next?""

The results are [here](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/if-the-commons-cannot-agree-on-a-deal-do-you-think-we-should-leave-with-no-deal-or-delay-article-50-and-hold-a-public-vote-on-what-to-do-next/). 

Direct comparisons between different polls are difficult. Opinium asked a different question to the one being asked by YouGov now, since it was No Deal vs Vote whereas this is No Deal vs Remain. But the percentage going for No Deal was about the same. The question in the ComRes poll sponsored by Leave Means Leave was phrased in a loaded way. But all three companies are getting No Deal as either the most popular or the second most popular option.

And that's what makes data collection dangerous. It is not about the data but what it means and how it will be used against you.

Privacy is not about hiding your secrets. Right to Privacy protects you from people who have ""issues"" with your ""secrets"". For example, you may be a muslim. But obviously you may not want that fact to be advertised when you are among a group of violent *Sanghis* or *Nazis* who will attack you. The fact that you are a muslim is just a data point in your profile.

Oh ok. I am not aware of that. Will look it up.

&gt; Why is it unsustainable?

As the US and middle east shows, it is in the interest of the insurance companies to make healthcare costlier, so that you cannot afford it without insurance. So their business model is based on driving up the costs of healthcare. The private hospitals to participate in this as higher costs means more profits. 

Ofcourse, once society is made depended on insurance, the insurance providers than start negotiating with the hospitals to cut down costs, to increase profits. The private hospitals fight back and negotiate tough. But they recognize that insurance only drives up their profits because without insurance people think twice and thrice before even visting a doctor or going for some procedure.

So a welfare model based on private insurers and private hospitals becomes a huge burden on the government as they will keep having to pay more and more to ensure coverage for anyone. Or they will have to cut back on the coverage to reduce costs. 

The United States provides one of the best medical care in the world. It is also the costliest in the world. This model is unsustainable for us. We need to model our healthcare based on Cuba's model or UK and European models.

I think the name is thrown around way too much and its lost a bit of its punch (pun intended). Anyone associated with the Alt-Right or conservatism in general is labelled a Nazi even though conservatism historically had nothing to do with fascism. In fact fascist of the early 20th century were explicitly anti-conservative. Nationalists and supremacists certainly exist and glorify the third Reich and fly their regalia but would we actually consider them Nazis? There was a sizable portion of the southern US that glorified the Confederacy and flew the flag for many many decades after the war was over. You could still see the romanticizing of antebellum south in literature and film well into the 30s and 40s but would we consider those people Confederates? Not really because that state no longer exists. Same with Nazis in my opinion. But the philosophy and ideologies of both of those states still exist. In the US we do not have a National Socialist party competing with the established parties like is happening in Europe. The thing to consider is the economic and social conditions, the mindsets and anger that led to the formation and rise of Nazis is present today. So my answer would be yes and no. Nazis do not exist anymore but the ideas that made them Nazis (xenophobia, nationalism, racial supremacy) are present and are growing today. The Confederate South shared many ideologies with National Socialist Germany but we would not consider them to be Nazis. In the end its all semantics. 



As a side note I find it interesting that modern people see fascism as this evil spectre that must be squashed any time it rears its ugly head regardless of the fact that Communists (the opposite side of the spectrum from fascism) were responsible for tens of millions of more deaths and suffering.

I hope he's more of a jack of all trades, the figurehead of the organization, helping out with some European scouting here, doing some shooting coaching there, teaching the next generation of guys Holger's Jedi training techniques, hanging out on the bench with the players, doing a lot of charity events, schmoozing with season ticket holders, really whatever the hell he wants to do, but no real responsibility to where he'd be at any risk of either him losing his job or the organization needing to remove him from it if he underperforms at it.

Rightly or wrongly we voted to leave, it happened, at that time anyone with a basic level of common sense took a look at the situation and must have thought to themselves.

We have a prime minister who voted stay, we have a media system who will be generally remain slanted.

And the EU are going to make leaving as painful as possible because the UK getting an easy ride at any level has the potential of others asking the same questions about leaving..

Remain or leave, kind of irrelevant as the cards are stacked..

For the years since the vote, it's been (again, rightly or wrongly) in the majority of cases a pretty consistent media message in the UK across social and traditional sources

- leave voters are racists
- leave voters will all die soon
- leave voters are estranged up country (read not from London or the home counties) nut jobs who don't understand global economics.

(To a degree there's a lot of this on these types of posts in Reddit to)

To be a leave voter has in some circles made people a periah.. and unfortunately some media coverage has made this totally acceptable.

However at the same time remained have had hard times being depicted as elitests, people unable to accept change.. 

The media has done an amazing job of polarising the country, and as such a grown up debate where understanding why people voted the way they did gets shot down with info, facts, truths and statements which are all understood to be accurate from both sides..

No conversation can take place

This has crept into our politics and culminated in where we are today.. a PM who could offer the goose that laid the golden egg of perfect solutions and still voted no..

All this time as the UK has descended into a slimey pit of haters, fear mongors, twisted facts on both sides of the argument.. the EU has a plan.

At the 11th (or 12th in this case) when all is falling around the UKs ears, disarray has set in, the media has done its job..

It offers an olive branch, a way out.. it offers what seems on the face of it to the rest of Europe the perfect solution..

The one small problem I personally have with all this, it's an olive branch for the solution to a problem entirely of its own making..

The EU is (again, only a personal opinion) trying via a side door to govern UK politics..

I go back to the start of this missive..

There is no such thing as a politician who does things for other people, every action will benefit one person and one person only.. that political figure..

I find myself in my little jaded view of the world asking..

Why? What does the EU get out of this? 

Well 

they keep a sovereign nation in the ranks
of course there's the financial gain, that's a lot of money which needs to be recouped from other nations if the UK leaves..

However most importantly

It sends a powerful message not just to the other EU member states, to the world as well I would suggest that the EU is here to stay and very powerful..

The last thing right now with so many far right populist votes happening in Europe is for the UK to be seen to leave, sure have some lean years, then start to thrive..

Remember how the media kept telling us that the London Olympics opening ceremony was going to be terrible, embarrassing and awful, and when it happened it was amazing... And we were going to be a joke around the world, and we were not, and even our team did amazing.. and that carried on till the next Olympics..

Remember how we were told it was going to be poorly planned and go way over budget and then we found out

London 2012: Olympics and Paralympics £528m under budget. The cost of the London Olympics and Paralympics was £528m less than expected, according to the government. The combined budget for the two events was £9.29bn, but the cost has been revised to £8.77bn.19 Jul 2013

That's how I see the media and the EU portraying this whole sorry state of affairs, I see economics (the statistics of the financial world, a trade by most economics people as ""based on assumption"") being used and yet so often these same people do get it constantly wrong .

So sure, this is an olive branch, sure I'm just insane and have my facts all wrong.. I did however write all of the above would happen the day after the vote was cast.. and I was spot on.

Downvote Away 😀

&gt;Tbm disse que, como somos todos de raça misturada, não tem como dizer  quem deve e quem não deve. Ou quem deve o quanto. Portanto talvez não se  deva usar esse argumento. 

Hipoteticamente se somos uma raça misturada não há porque ter discriminação racial, explique agora porque os negros estão em menores números no meio academico, altos cargos em empresas e porque eles são a maioria entre os pobres....ja que não temos raça, estamos discriminando atoa mesmo, apenas porque o povo gosta.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As pessoas que perseguiam e/ou prejudicavam negros tem culpa. Mas você  vai associar a culpa desses à todos da sua raça? Por que ? 

Porque todos desfrutaram disso, não apenas os perseguidores... ou apenas os perseguidores que desfrutavam das beneficies sociais por não ser negro....??

Ai que esta cara, voce acha que a culpa é do homem branco e apenas isso, isso é um dogma social, é a sociedade que tem que pagar, agora faça um exercício mental, quem é que esta na maioria dos cargos de poder efetivos no Brasil, brancos ou negros??

  
As pessoas não entendem que quando se fala ""a divida do homem branco"" (sic) se trata mais por ser um sistema onde os pardos ou brancos são a maioria nos cargos de poder, então efetivamente são eles que tem que fazer algo para mudar esse quadro.... no dia que a inserção de brancos e negros forem a mesma, ja não há porque ter cotas e outros dispositvos como este.

Some key points mentioned (and some not mentioned in the video, but an easy thought away):

* About 20% of customs paperwork have errors. Errors mean delays.

* Many UK (and EU) companies have not had to produce customs paperwork in decades, and so are unused to filling it out. More potential for errors, more potential for delays.

* The van guy ships a lot of car parts. But this won't affect just car manufacturers -- it will affect any company that works on a just-in-time schedule, e.g. some types of medicine, supermarkets with fresh foods.

 Ele relatou um episÃ³dio de abuso, supostamente cometido por agentes da polÃ­cia local, e concluiu: âDesvio de conduta a gente tem em todo lugar. Tem na casa da gente, tem um irmÃ£o que Ã© homossexual, tem outro que Ã© ladrÃ£o, entendeu?â 

 O entÃ£o secretÃ¡rio disse que, em seu entendimento, âhomossexualidade nÃ£o quer dizer bandidagemâ. âMas foge ao padrÃ£o de comportamento da famÃ­lia brasileira tradicional. EntÃ£o, em todo lugar tem alguma coisa errada, e a polÃ­cia, nÃ©? A linha em que a polÃ­cia anda, ela Ã© muito tÃªnue, nÃ£o Ã©?â

 Na ocasiÃ£o, DamÃ¡zio tambÃ©m foi questionado sobre a possibilidade de instalar cÃ¢meras em viaturas, uma vez que policiais as usariam para praticar sexo. Ele explicou que haveria problemas com âassociaÃ§Ãµesâ e opinou que as mulheres, Ã s vezes, âse achamâ porque estÃ£o com policial.

 âO policial exerce um fascÃ­nio no dito sexo frÃ¡gil. Eu nÃ£o sei por que Ã© que mulher gosta tanto de fardaâ, declarou. 

 Para DamÃ¡zio, segundo a entrevista publicada pelo Jornal do Commercio, âtodo policial militar mais antigo tem duas famÃ­lias, tem uma amante, duasâ. Ele falou sobre o suposto magnetismo exercido pela categoria em mulheres. 

 âÃ um negÃ³cio. Eu sou policial federal, feio pra c. A gente ia pra Floresta (SertÃ£o), para esses lugares. Quando chegÃ¡vamos lÃ¡, colocÃ¡vamos o colete, as meninas ficavam tudo sassaricadas. Ãs vezes tinham namorado, Ã s vezes eram mulheres casadas. Pra ela Ã© o mÃ¡ximo estar dando pra um policial. Dentro da viatura, entÃ£o, o fetiche vai lÃ¡ em cima, Ã© coisa de doido.â

 As declaraÃ§Ãµes, Ã Ã©poca, geraram reaÃ§Ã£o de entidades feministas e ligadas Ã defesa dos direitos humanos. Como consequÃªncia, o entÃ£o secretÃ¡rio entregou o cargo.

 Procurados, por meio da assessoria do MinistÃ©rio da JustiÃ§a, Moro e DamÃ¡zio ainda nÃ£o se pronunciaram.

Greater danger of authoritarianism and myopic laws. There's a reason why London is the contract law capital of Europe. Companies around the world trust the common law tradition not to change the rules on them far more than codified systems. I'd rather have checks and balances than fewer bin bags dumped in nature. Moreover, consumer protection is actually typically worse under codified systems because the complete lack judicial input lets companies really take advantage of the limits of the law without much fear of successful judgement against them. Ever signed a contract in Germany or France? They pretty much expect your first-born. 

A codified legal system might be more expedient, but expedience is not good in law generally. It is better to have some crime and authorities with limited power than it is to have no crime and overly centralised power.  It might not seem that way if your goal is to build a utopia, but such ideas have been proven dangerous historically. I'd take robust judicial decision making over government-mandated top-down planning any day.

Also, from a legal practitioners perspective, common law, with its history of case law based in actual historical events, is vastly more interesting than memorising thousands of codes that could be reformed at any moment the government fancies.  

Frankly, it amazes me that Germans can look down on common law with their own history, and actually commend the extension of government power that codified law allows, but as you've pointed out, most Germans have an absolutist mentality towards law and society generally, which probably contributed to their rocky history. 

Culturally, many countries see laws as an unfortunate necessity that shouldn't really be needed for people to live moral lives. They tend to ignore laws and go with their moral feeling until such a point where it becomes necessary. Germany's relationship with law seems to be different. A society without rules is chaos to them, and many people actually learn the laws and expect people in society to follow them to the letter. That's just a cultural difference.

This has been rejected three times by the House of Commons. But MPs have been unable to agree on an alternative to Mrs May’s deal, beyond rejecting the idea of a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister has decided to seek a second extension to the talks with the European Union, and may yet make a fourth attempt to win parliamentary approval.

&gt;Whatever happens with Brexit, Mrs May has in effect fired the starting pistol in the race to succeed her as Tory leader and prime minister. Betfair Exchange, a betting website, has been tracking punters’ predictions on the next Tory leader. According to the wisdom of the crowd five Tory candidates stand out. On April 2nd, Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary and prominent Brexit campaigner, became the narrow favourite to win.

I'm not even sure if it's purely about appeasing the party as such. Casting the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal is vital to having any power in the negotiation process. You can not engage and negotiate with an entity that knows full well you're unable to walk away without taking any offer they make.

This is true for any negotiation I can think of - be those negotiations of a geopolitical nature, or even the sale of a personal item. Were you to sell your car, you wouldn't sit down with the potential buyer and say ""*Look mate, I cannot walk away without a sale - so what's your offer?*"" - you'd quite rightly get the worst price possible, as the other party is aware that you have no choice but to accept it. I know full well I've never gone in to salary negotiations and said ""*Right, I absolutely accept this job - and I absolutely cannot reject your offer.. so, what is your offer?*"".

The ultimate truth is that every time an MP has argued against - and sought to prevent the possibility of - a ""*No Deal Brexit*"", they've undermined the negotiating position of the United Kingdom. Regardless of whether they truly want a ""No Deal"", and regardless of whether they support Brexit itself, they've placed their own opinions and views above the worth of the United Kingdom.

This has caused even more issues now as it's down to EU as to how we go about extending the negotiation period, and the EU can - quite easily - provide minimal notice (if any), safe in the knowledge that many will refuse to disengage and will simply take whatever offer is available at that time.

[],BillyDeeWilliams1990,1466458360.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yw8u7,False,"I presume you're referring to self-loading firearms. In fact, the rifles used by the major combatants in WWI were all 'repeaters,' as the term is used in firearms history. A repeating firearm is any firearm that doesn't have to be reloaded after each shot. So, a revolver is a form of a repeater, as is a lever-action Winchester, and so are the Short Magazine Lee-Enfields, the Mauser Gewehr 98s, the Lebel 1886s, the Mosin-Nagants, and the Steyr-Mannlicher M95s the major WWI combatants primarily employed. Each of those weapons have magazines, usually five but sometimes eight or ten rounds in capacity. And so, while the soldier did need to work a bolt to *rechamber* between each shot, he did not have to *reload the gun* between each shot. Thus, repeaters.

As to why the combatants didn't employ self-loading small arms (that is, semi-automatic firearms, which rechamber automatically using leftover force from firing, whether gas or recoil, and thus can be fired as fast as the soldier can pull the trigger, or fully automatic firearms, which do all of that but on which you can simply hold down the trigger), it's a matter of technology.

At the time of WWI, smokeless powder repeating small arms were both sort of on the bleeding edge of firearm technology, and also almost obsolete, at the same time. Self-loading technology was well known, and widespread in the form of heavy, water-cooled machine guns. There were also well-known prototypes of self-loading small arms, which had cropped up occasionally in pre-war firearms trials throughout Europe, and everyone wanted them, for obvious reasons.

However, self-loading small arms technology was, at the time, quite rudimentary, and there were serious issues with virtually every part of the technology, from creating weapons strong enough to withstand so much firing and also light enough to use, recoil issues, overheating issues, accidental fully automatic fire issues (contrary to what you might expect, fully automatic weapons are much easier to make than semi-automatic, which require a disconnector or sere to prevent full auto), manufacturing capacity, considerably greater expense than a normal bolt-action (automatic firearms have many more moving parts than non-automatic), and perhaps the biggest issue, aside from cost: cycling.

That is, there were very few self-loading small arms at the time that would reliably run through the entire process of firing and rechambering without intervention from the soldier. That process, in theory, goes like this: (1) first round in magazine manually chambered by soldier; (2) trigger pulled; (3) hammer/striker drops; (4) primer ignites; (5) propellant ignites; (6) bullet leaves jacket then barrel; (7) recoil of firing or gas piston (fed by propellant gas) forces the bolt carriage and assembly back; (8) re-cocking hammer/striker; (9) exposing the spent casing to the ejection port; (10) sere and trigger reset; (11) extractor ejects spent casing; (12) bolt carriage moves forward, picking up another cartridge from magazine, which is chambered when the bolt carriage comes to rest and locks; (13) ready to fire again.

In general, each of these things had to happen in a few milliseconds, and if any one of these went wrong even slightly, the gun wouldn't be automatically ready to fire again, and the soldier would have to fiddle with it.

As a result of these difficulties, and the enormous cost of equipping everyone with a self-loading rifle, the combatants of WWI focused their budget for infantry equipment where it would do the most good: heavy and light machine guns, the latter of which made an especially large impression on the minds of all the combatants.

The French are an especially interesting case study in this regard. The French were the first to perfect smokeless powder, and they wanted to capitalize on their advantage as much as they possibly could, so they rushed development of a rifle to go along with the smokeless powder, which would ultimately be the Lebel 1886, the first smokeless powder repeating rifle. But this approach had major drawbacks, especially because there was no great European war soon after 1886. But, because they rushed, their gun lacked many of the features that would be regarded as fairly essential during the actual war, and which the other combatants' weapons had. First and foremost, the Lebel 1886 did not have a box magazine; it had a tube magazine (like a Winchester or a shotgun), and so each bullet had to be loaded individually. Other, more modern weapons could load 5 cartridges at a time. Also, the 8mm Lebel cartridge had a distinct taper (essentially, the bullet resembled a cone rather than a cylinder), which was fairly standard at the time of the Lebel rifle was designed. But the tapered cartridge could not be put into belts or flexible links, which were critical for machine guns. As a result, French machine guns were fed from long, rigid steel clip magazines, which was ultimately adequate, but were cumbersome and were more labor-intensive for the loader, since they only held about 30 rounds each.

These failings would become acute during the war, and so the French were the first to really look into replacing their bolt-action rifles with self-loading ones, and they did this during the war. The end result was the RSC 1917, of which about 90,000 were made during the war, and these were actually used. Its performance was good for a weapon that was so hastily developed, and the French planned to massively increase deployment of them for the 1919 spring campaign, which ultimately did not happen. The British also had a self-loader that they intended to deploy in 1919, the Farquhar-Hill.

The French did have one very notable hit of a small(ish) arm during WWI: the Chauchat. The weapon has a very poor reputation in the USA, but it is largely not deserved. The low reputation is attributable to the (actually bad) Chauchats chambered in .30-06, which the French made for American forces in Europe. The Chauchat chambered in 8mm Lebel was an extremely effective weapon, and the French had a very large number of them.

After the war, however, all the same limitations came back up, and almost no one replaced their bolt-actions with self-loaders. Even the most famous user of self-loaders in WWII, the USA, did not completely equip its infantry with them until after the US entered the war. The USMC fought a substantial chunk of the Pacific War with bolt-action Springfield rifles.

If you're wondering why the French didn't stick with the RSC after the war, given its adequacy, the answer is that the French wanted to completely overhaul their small arms, and especially to get rid of the 8mm Lebel cartridge. They partially succeeded in this, in the end. They designed a new, non-tapered rifle cartridge, the 7.5mm French, and designed new weapons to go with it. The French invested most of their time and money into the light machine gun, which produced FM 24/29, a very fine weapon that was widely deployed in the French army before WWII. As to rifles, the French wanted to design a self-loader for the new 7.5mm cartridge, but were unable to do so due to budget cuts and the like. Instead, they designed a new bolt-action rifle, the MAS-36, for the new cartridge as a stop-gap, even though they knew bolt-actions were obsolete.",True,False,False,,0,1554247184,,1554247683,0,{},ejzgxrz,False,t3_b8my74,False,True,t3_b8my74,/r/AskHistorians/comments/b8my74/world_war_one_repeaters/ejzgxrz/,False,,1557289409,2,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0.0,

AC Milan on the other hand had one of the best teams to ever grace the football pitch, like it was insane. The likes of Kaka, Pirlo, Shevchenko, etc. Not to mention their bench that could probably make it to the final and win as well. Safe to say, AC Milan were on the cards to go ahead and win the Champions League.

By the kick-off, Milan were dominating, and they scored early on. Within the first half they were 3-0 up and coasting to European success.

The second half was a completely different story. Liverpool were not going down without a fight. In the span of 5 minutes in the second half they equalized, making it 3-3. The most remarkable was the Xabi Alonso equalizer that came off a saved penalty by Milan's keeper. 

Shocked and amazed, the world watched on, as potentially the best team in the world was brought the their knees in front of a bang average Liverpool side. 

After 90 minutes the score is even. They battle it out in extra time. An assured Milan goal gets cleared off the line by the Liverpool defense. Liverpool created few chances.  The scores were still an even 3-3 as the final whistle of the two extra periods resonates in Istanbul. 

Time for penalties. Milan miss. Liverpool score. Milan miss again. Liverpool score again. Milan score. Liverpool miss. Milan score. Liverpool score. 

Liverpool are one goal up. Shevchenko steps up. He shoots down the middle. Liverpool's keeper Jerzy Dudek dives to the right - Milan are about to equalize - but at the last moment he sticks his left hand out and makes an unreal save to win Liverpool their 5th Champions League title.

Playing it’s 15 years old album Gravity X from finish to start

You can’t escape from what you are.

The answer could be as simple as that.

Almost two years off the grid feels very long when used to playing ‘all the time’. In August we return with the start of a world tour to celebrate our first album ‘Gravity X’. Originally released 2005 in Europe (2006 USA) it turns 15 years in 2020. We will give the celebration a jump start second half of 2019 with selected shows in North America and a big European tour. The rest of the world (hopefully) to follow in 2020-2021. 🙂

This time our plans don’t go further, what happens happens. There’s only so much you can control in life.
If ever there was any doubt, this time off has shown us who we really are. We want to play enough shows to satisfy our inner urge without losing motivation. It is safe to say the touring will be less frequent than our most intense years. Just as safe as is it to say that the shows will be better than ever and as always with a hell of a fuzzy sound!

Thanks for your support , we truly hope we are not forgotten!

&gt;\&gt; Pessoas que vão fazer compras à hora de almoço (ou jantar, consoante a loja) ou 1 hora antes de fecho e esperam que as caixas estejam todas abertas e ainda mandam bocas que não há mais caixas abertas.

Há muitas empresas que têm horários variados em que a hora de refeição não bate com as horas comuns. Eu, por exemplo, tenho a minha hora de refeição às 18. As pessoas queixam-se porque a gestão poderia ser feita de outra maneira. As pessoas que vão fazer compras a essa hora, uma parte delas, é porque não consegue ir noutra. E mesmo que não fossem, é normal que se queixem porque esse horário é um horário normal de funcionamento. Chegar lá e ver falta de empregados é normal que os deixe fodidos.

Peter Lynch, Graham, também.

Na Bastter.com tem um monte de estudos de longo prazo, alguns até demonstrando que mesmo com mais micos do que empresas boas na carteira dá pra ter um ótimo retorno.

Gente tentando ganhar dinheiro de incautos, seja com B&amp;H ou trade tem aos montes. Curso de baixa qualidade tem em tudo quanto é assunto. A questão que eu quis levantar é que é muito mais fácil e muito mais provável que alguém tenha crescimento de patrimônio de forma segura, com muito menos risco seguindo o B&amp;H. Mesmo aprendendo por conta, sem gastar um tostão, se gasta muito menos tempo aprendendo B&amp;H.

Susquehanna é uma exceção entre as grandes empresas de investimento. É mais uma prova de que pouquíssimos conseguem prevalecer com trade. Continua validando a ideia de que pouquíssimos vencem com trade. A maioria das empresas não vence. Se fizessem um estudo com empresas que ""treidam"" eu chuto que os percentuais seriam muito parecidos com o que o estudo da FGV apresentou. 

Enfim, a gente pode ficar eternamente discutindo isso, mas uma coisa é fato: a probabilidade de ganhar muito dinheiro no longo prazo com B&amp;H é muito maior do que a probabilidade de ganhar muito dinheiro no curto prazo com trade. Quem vai pro trade tem que ir ciente que o risco de perder dinheiro e altíssimo. 

Ganhar dinheiro é algo muito pessoal. Crie a sua estratégia e siga ela. Mas tem que seguir por alguns anos, pra validar mesmo. Se ela te agrada, continue seguindo. Se ela não te agrada, mude.

Na minha opinião pessoal, trade envolve muito risco. Acho que vale muito mais a pena pegar a grana que seria aplicada no trade, e usar pra aprender algo novo, melhorar sua renda do trabalho, empreender... A probabilidade de ganhar mais dinheiro fazendo isso também é maior do que ganhar dinheiro com trade. 

Eu me considero um cara na média. Não sou O ESCOLHIDO, não sou o fera neném. Eu respeito as probabilidades e busco colocá-las ao meu favor.

Then the fixation with corruption, every argument is always reduced to ""it's corruption"" to the point you can't argue. Like once there was this someone, they believed food in the country side isn't safe because all sanitary inspectors must be corrupt, and then when I did mention this or this other statistics and how it probably has one of the safest foods in the country, the guy said that it must be because who took those statistics were corrupt, and he was moderately upvoted. Like italy has been one of the most childless countries in the world for six decades now, yet twenty years ago before this lack of young really did its toll, there'd be those still convinced italy is full of mamma with twelve kids or smth. And then the evergreen that since it's italian engineering it must be not reliable or something, and if you try to discuss that no one would leave their conviction, it's impossible.

The attackers had been posed as Polish nationals. Adolf Hitler invaded Poland the next morning after a lengthy period of preparations.

An example for ridiculous diversity is the flak that the game kingdom come deliverance got. It’s a game about europe in the mid 15 hundreds (I think) and it got torn to shreds by some people because there were only white people. 


As long as characters are fleshed out with goals, motivations and a believable personality, nobody will mind their diversity.

That is simply not true, there are many countries that trade with the eu that arent part of the eu, you simply trade under WTO rules until a treaty between nations can be decided upon for new rules of trade. Do you think russia is part of the eu? No? Then how come the eu gets their gas from them? Is china part of the eu? No? You literally cannot count the amount of made in china products in the eu. Do bananas grow in the eu? I  can go on if youd like but i think my point is clear.

2. Sortof but not exactly, the president of the commission in accordance with a member state determines a candidate for the european commission, yes the parliament then approves them, but not just them, the whole council, individual commissioners cannot be rejected, though the president can ask a member state for a new candidate if he is sure the parliament would vote to reject.

This usually results in only the worst candidates being rejected and a compromise being reached for the rest.

Furthermore the members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

And the more capable the candidate is, or as i read it, the more pro EU the candidate is, the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio, the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion.

So yes technically the people you voted on select a candidate, who has to be agreed on by the president of the commission, then the european parliament, of whom you also voted on some of them, decides to either reject or approve the entire commission, its a package deal, sp only the worst of the worst get sent back to their country by the president and the rest get grandfathered in.

Then the president gets to pick the people he feels are the best or most pro eu and give them powerful portfolios at his sole discretion.

However people are unlikely to not vote for someone  just because of how they voted on a particular commission or because they selected a candidate that proposed something bad, people usually dont look into politics that deeply and there are other decisions made within that timeframe that also influence their decisions.

So while yes they are technically democratically legitimate they are several degrees removed from a direct representation and their democratic legitimacy is therefore shaky at best. You can disagree ofcourse, but it has been an issue for a while now. Add that to the often not clearly stated intentions of the commissioners and a natural pro eu bias in people who choose to go work in the eu. Id hope you can understand why i am worried.

They had an absolutely direct lineage. Their emperors inherited the empire using the conventional rules of succession, from the classical Roman emperors all the way back to Augustus, and beyond. There is a continuity in the institutions of power too. It's the same empire.

&gt; It's not reasonable to consider them ""Romans,"" as they had no actual ties to Rome after the 400s. 

Saying that they're not 'the Roman Empire' because when the empire was split into two equal halves, they didn't get the half with the city of Rome in it is more like a semantic game than any acknowledgement of historical reality. 

The empire happened to be named after the city of Rome, due to it's founding, but that doesn't mean it stopped existing just because Rome wasn't part of the empire. England has not had any ties to Anglia in Germany for over 1500 years now, but it can still call itself 'England', because the country is named after a tribe that originally hailed from Anglia, and not the place they originally came from. Same with the Roman empire - it was a pan-European social institution, not just a thing that lived in the city of Rome. 

In fact, the Eastern Roman empire actually recaptured Italy in the 6th century. By your silly logic, it must have magically become 'The Roman Empire' again for a couple of hundred years before suddenly deciding to not be Roman again. Makes no sense.

Of course, you could claim that it wasn't the Roman empire in 660AD because the seat of power wasn't the city of Rome, even though Rome was part of the empire - but guess what? That was true back when the Roman Empire was unified under Constantine and his successors. Byzantium/Constantinople was actually the capital city of the unified empire at the time of the split. The sane way to resolve this is to acknowledge that it's the continuity of the political and social institutions that define what the empire is. Nothing else makes much sense.

tldr; the Roman empire split into two parts, both with equal rights to the name 'Roman Empire', and both were, by any sociological metric, the Roman empire.

I won't name names specifically, but it should be obvious once you start reading the thread anyway. I'll chiefly address issues relating to the Qing period or earlier as I... didn't have time to research post-1911 Xinjiang in depth. These quotes and argumentswill be taken from various users either side of the divide. Obviously, we're talking about how these events relate to modern politics, but I'll try not to dwell unduly upon them.

(Side note: I use 'Uighur' here to denote all Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, which is somewhat inaccurate as it should be 'Taranchi' or 'East Turkestani', but I do so for ease of recognition.)

Let's start with the big points. Firstly, Xinjiang can really be divided into two broad regions. To the north, Dzungaria, where predominantly Uighurs had lived since the 8th century before being gradually pushed out by various Mongol powers, particularly the Chagatai, Oirat and Dzungar Khanates. To the south, the Tarim Basin, which always remained Uighur-dominated after the conquest of the Tocharians in the 9th century. As such, claims that Uighurs were never the majority in Ürümqi – presumably shorthand for Dzungaria – are both inaccurate and irrelevant to the issue of whether rebel elements in Xinjiang are seeking independence or not, as they *have* traditionally remained the majority in Tarim, which is the focal point of modern claims for East Turkestan, even if protests, violence and terrorist acts occur elsewhere in Xinjiang in particular and China more broadly.

The second is that permanent settlement of Han and Hui Chinese *civilian populations* in Xinjiang began under the Qing. All those people insisting that Xinjiang was settled by the Chinese during the Han and Tang Dynasties overlook both the fact that these were *military* colonies (noticeably, the only people using 'colony' and its derivatives were myself and the downvoted guy, except one quote which I'll bring up later), and that these were never permanent – there was no Chinese rule in Xinjiang during the Three Kingdoms period or the Sui Dynasty, while the Tang withdrew their colonies to fight An Lushan (and made an alliance, by the way, with the Uighurs, whose settlement in Xinjiang they assented to). It was the integration of Xinjiang under the Qing that saw the first introduction of civilian agricultural colonies, first in Dzungaria, where the genocide had depopulated the region (disturbingly little mention of that, by the way), and after the 1830s in Tarim.

Thirdly, on the matter of internal movement of peoples, the Qing as well as the Dzungars were engaged in the resettlement of Uighurs into Dzungaria (why Dzungar-encouraged northward migration was supposed to be an argument for why the Chinese had a better claim, when it would prove that the Uighurs were there earlier, is unaddressed). However, Qing resettlement was primarily of Chinese, not Uighurs, who remained predominantly in the south save for a few isolated communities in the north. So once again, claiming that Ürümqi was never Uighur-majority is, even if true (it isn't) a complete red herring, as Xinjiang has been much more heterogeneous than these ostensible concentration camp apologists (a term I am perfectly happy to use as I'm not seeing any opposition to the camps from these people) believe.

Fourthly, as regards Xinjiang's status in WW2, it is true that the sensible but downvoted commenter mistakenly claimed that Xinjiang was reconquered by the CCP during WW2. It wasn't – in 1944 Sheng Shicai, its Manchu warlord, was coerced into submitting to Chiang Kai-Shek. However, to all those claiming that Xinjiang was *not* an independent state in WW2 because nobody recognised it, need I remind them that a) there is also the declarative theory of statehood, and b) do they not understand the concept of a warlord clique?

Then, a few minor points which can be refuted with some short quips.

&gt; No, even Taiwan don’t agree with you.

&gt; Just google, use wiki, to see the political map of the world 1930s and 1940s. Seriously, you don’t need to ask any mainlanders, just people of Hong Kong and Taiwan, any they would tell you Xinjiang was in Republic of China, then civil war, then People’s Republic of China.

*argumentum ad populum*

Worst of all, though, if you read other parts of the thread ([np link](https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/b1j91k/what_are_the_international_implications_of_the/ein4dg4/)) there are some really bizarre claims.

&gt; So many ignorant Westerners simply assume that Xinjiang is a historic home to the Uyghurs, when in fact it isn't and the Uyghurs genocided the Mongolians who lived there prior. Heck, Urumuqi is a Mongolian name.

I... what? When exactly was this Uighur genocide of the Mongols, and how did the Uighurs, who lived in Turfan and Tarim from the 9th century onwards, wipe out Mongols who at that stage were still under Turkic dominion back in Mongolia?

&gt; Colonizing is your white supremacists' privilege not related with Chinese.

***W T F***

But for something no less preachy but much less vile:

&gt; Prior to the Qing's conquest and genocide in the 19th century it was an independent Mongolian successor state like much of the middle east. That is roughly the same time as the European colonisation of China (and largely enabled by the provision of European weapons and doctrine). If you think that justifies Chinese ownership of Xinjiang then I'm going to have to ask for the French concession back from Shanghai. It's not a question of might, the west could have recolonised China at any moment over the past hundred years, it's that developed societies realise that the right for a people to self determine their country's destiny is more important than imposing a racial hegemony and extracting wealth. I guess that the CCP isn't quite there yet.

I mean, it's soapboxy and moralising, but the first three sentences at least are a pretty reasonable argument. They did not receive a reasonable response.

Through insufficient enforcement, or the public just not giving a shit, they lost the exclusive use of those brands. I remember reporting on when Adobe hilariously put out a friendly press release in the early 2000s demanding we all say ""Photoshop®"" and only use that word to refer to digital image editing carried out within Adobe® Photoshop® itself. Of course, nobody gave a shit, and ""photoshop"" is still used as a generic term.

Back to football...the problem is, you can't trademark ""Inter"" within the context of football, due to it being a generic prefix with many clubs already prexing Inter or some variant thereof. You also can't trademark a city name, although you can trademark a combination of both, so ""Inter Milan"", ""Real Madrid"" and ""Manchester United"" are all trademarks.

Inter Milan would have to show:

1) That people would get ""FC Inter Milan"" and ""Inter Miami CF"" confused, even though the logos are completely different and they're based in different continents

2) That ""FC Inter Milan"" would be confused for ""Inter Miami CF"" in the US, a country where even fewer people have heard of Inter Milan than have heard of Inter Miami

3) That this is enough to prevent a football club from following a convention that stretches back almost 150 years: any combination of suffix/prefix and city name is legitimate as long as it doesn't create confusion locally.

If this is actual court action, it's idiotic. They do not own the word ""Inter"" within football. Nor do they have the right to claim that other clubs whose city names are *similar* to Milan shouldn't be able to name their club whatever they want. Hell, I could found ""SSC Inter Milano 2019"" in Milan and still likely be on good legal ground as long as I make clear this is a team for international players based in Milan, and design a badge completely different to Inter Milan's. Of course, Inter would still send the lawyers round...

They've managed to get smaller clubs to change their name due to the threat of legal action. Do they really think David Beckham and the MLS are going to acquiese? Beckham's team of highly paid sports lawyers would've done their due diligence and seen ""Inter"" isn't a trademark within the US, EU and other major football markets. Sheffield FC, Sheffield Utd, Sheffield Wednesday. Manchester Utd, Manchester City, FC United of Manchester. There is strong precedent for not allowing a descriptive prefix to be trademarked by itself.

What I don’t understand is that the conversation that has taken over Brexit is that Brexit is only Brexit if it leaves the single market, and presumably having different regulations on goods than the EU. So, the two sides of the Irish border will have different sets of goods which may be illegal on the other side or whatever. 

Not immediately, but definitely. 

This is what no-dealers are demanding. Bringing up day after and GATT etc is ignoring the logical and only outcome of deliberately leaving EU regulations on trade in order to make different regulations. 

You’re the one bringing up fences and guard posts on day one as if that is the over the top stupid argument that people who dislike no-deal are making which is why it seems like a straw man. 

People are pointing out that the Irish border question is a long term confusion and source of trouble that leads to a hard economic border. It must be answered for at least the short to medium term. 

————

If you want to talk about the public discourse being debased, then look at how Brexit has been forced into a harder position than it was to start with- everything before the referendum was saying that “no one is talking about leaving the single market” and that a Norway style deal is the best way forward. 

People voted based on what people from the leave campaigns were saying about a Norway style deal. The will of the people at the time of the referendum was a Norway style deal.

Fantasy

- Yona of the Dawn (2014) Action/adventure with a Korean low fantasy setting. Lots of character development occurs regarding the main character throughout the series one of my favorite Female MC’s (her journey from spoiled princess to dashing rogue is wonderful). You might have to switch to the manga when you are done with the anime unfortunately. Manga is fairly successful, but it’s been awhile since the last season. Author is a fan of LOTOR and its reflected in the story as it’s a big epic fantasy adventure.

[Yona of the Dawn OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfgNlVdDnxs)

- KonoSuba (2016) Basically the most dysfunctional fantasy adventure party on the planet. Great comedy series.

[KonoSuba Season 2 OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JpR-M1wE5s&amp;feature=youtu.be)

- Maquia Where the Promised Flower Blooms (2018) Fantasy adventure film that focuses on motherhood and what it means to be a mother.

[Maquia Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEWvRqZQ0RU)


- Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) While the premise is pretty strange in some ways with the main character being the age/gender they are reincarnated into; that aspect exists more to have people underestimate or be fearful of her (and I guess it makes sense lore wise when you think about it). The premise is basically magic World War I (with some WW2 elements) with the author actually throwing in a few historical references here and there.  

[Saga of Tanya the Evil Op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMwlVyfy3m4)


Science Fiction:

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series with animation that holds up amazing well today. It also had one of the best endings in anime in my opinion. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well-regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that. Also recommend the dub for this one.

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime. Has some interesting views on society mainly dealing with the issue of an over monitored  state. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Q4emwDFYg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLAbghykhSTZPNEqvWnC8ZuAEU_PazwJZm)


- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime. Film is just basically about this massive death race and has some of the best animation ever.

[Redline Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)


- Code Geass (2006) Is another really popular anime deals with the moral complexities of revolution and rebellion. It takes place in an alternate history and it’s also a pretty good intro to the mecha genre. Some great character development and moral dilemmas that the characters face.

[Code Geass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7zQbMxm28)

- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) (Remake 2018-) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting a enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series if you do) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

 [Legend of the Galactic Heroes OP 3]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hryo6H57y6I)
 

- Ghost in the Shell (Film 1995) (SAC 2002) Film is more philosophical taking a look at human consciousness and what it means to be human. SAC is more of a straight up crime drama.

[Ghost in the Shell Film Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvBVDibOrgs)

[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG  OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- The Promised Neverland (2019) Sci Fi/Supernatural Anime about children escaping an orphanage after discovering a horrifying secret. Battles of wits as direct confrontation is impossible. 

[The Promised Neverland Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApLudqucq-s)

- Carol and Tuesday (April 2019) Coming from studio Bones and well known anime director Shinichirō Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Kids on the Slope, Space Dandy, Samurai Champloo etc) about two girls trying to start their own music group in a world where AI has mostly taken over the job of creating music.

[Carol and Tuesday PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBak9m0bcB0)



- Dr Stone (July 2019) Take a battle shonen have it set in a post apocalyptic world and then have its power escalation be like the tech tree from the game Civilization and that is Dr Stone. (one of Shonen Jump's biggest new titles) 

[Dr Stone PV]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NxtW57oyKg)






Action/Adventure (Other):

- My Hero Academia (2016) Great show to check out if you like the Marvel or DC superhero films. A typical underdog rises to the top story but it’s really well executed and has a cast of beloved characters with some good action and a great soundtrack

[My Hero Academia OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu0HjPzFYnY)

- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) Generational action shonen that involves multiple characters throughout time. Adapted from an older manga that is still going after decades. Has a very unique sense of style with a really creative battle system that makes it standout from many action shonen. Would give it until episode 12 to know if its for you. (Part 1 is considered the weakest of the 8)

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf7h0D-Qwf8)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Action comedy about a psychic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city while he learns to grow as a person.

[Mob Psycho 100 OP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpApXzwAP0&amp;index=2&amp;list=FLsNBO_i0YOwmyoaxjB-AZ7g&amp;t=0s)

- One Punch Man (2015) This anime has some amazing animation done for it. One Punch Man I think has one of the best fight scenes in anime. It also kind of parodies the battle shonen (basically the tropes present in superhero movies and anime like DBZ).

[One Punch Man OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxYe-nOa9w)

- Black Lagoon (2006) Anime about mercenaries and modern day piracy on the high seas. (this is another one where I recommend dub even as a mainly sub watcher) 

[Black Lagoon OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCPOzUTCb8g)




Slice of Life (Drama):

- Violet Evergarden (2018) Beautiful animation from Kyoto Animation. Mostly a slice of life series in a post war world (somewhat like post war Europe after world war 1). Focuses on an emotionally stunted child soldier who is learning more about human emotions and how to convey them in words. Mostly a slice of life series though there are more action segments towards the end.

[Violet Evergarden Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFVKmVTAHpk)


- March Comes in Like A Lion (2016) Deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL5nnx4vd7k)

- Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (2016) Really good period drama about the art of rakugo (a form of theater/storytelling) and the various characters attempts to preserve it from the various hardships around them as well as use it as a source of confidence and identity.

[Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK5XlNWNfq4)

- A Silent Voice (2016) Deals with redemption group think, bullying, living with a disability and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and an unbelievable soundtrack. I would also read the manga after finishing it (as the movie skips over stuff).

I mean, I care as far as ""wow, that is stupid, why was she able to do that,"" but I don't hold that against her. There is no way the 70 year old woman is responsible for understanding how IT works. If my grandmother is any indication, she probably doesn't know the difference between a server and the text saved on her cell phone. It's not something she should be expected to know, in my opinion. The fault rests squarely with whoever ran her IT department at State. 

As for what she did wrong, I find it... troubling when someone is repeatedly investigated for criminal actions, and ""cleared"" not because they are innocent, but because there isn't enough evidence to convict. There's the argument that it's all politics, but at a certain point SOMETHING is wrong. Either she's skirting the bounds of the law, or ignoring them and not being charged. Neither is good.

I don't care so much about her domestic policy objectives. I don't LIKE everything she advocated, but the reality is that the President has little control over it, beyond guiding their party and whipping votes. She would have appointed justices I don't care for, and then tried to do some actually useful stuff like putting a stake through anti-abortion legislation at a state level and funding a national healthcare system. Mixed bag overall, but I don't think it would have mattered. Even if she had taken the White House, a Republican Congress would have stalled her out. Her domestic policy would have been compromised by an opposition Congress.

The bigger issue, to me, was foreign policy. I strongly disagree with her hawkish stance on intervention in the Middle East and northern Africa. I believe that the American government is perceived negatively across the world because we take TOO much authority upon ourselves, particularly with how we treat our allies in Asia and Europe, and her policies (as well as methods) were unnecessarily inflammatory. I think America needs to take a step back, and begin to acknowledge that we are not the unilateral superpower we were in 1948. The way that Secretary Clinton conducted foreign policy is, to my mind, precisely the kind of bullying that the Germans (and, by extension the EU) has been growing to resent, and while it may accomplish short-term goals in the long-term Europe and our Asian allies in Japan and South Korea will form blocs opposed to US intervention in their corner of the world. I could be wrong, but that's my issue with the way she conducted foreign policy. Too much stick, not enough talking. 

She also is just... bad at speaking to people. Every time she gave an interview, something felt off. It's like looking at someone trying to be human, instead of a human, if that makes sense. She often made gaffes when speaking that indicated (at least to me) that her thoughts and her words didn't align. That's bad. We don't want to elect someone who will say whatever is convenient at the time. We want to elect someone who believes what they say. Go back and listen to FDR, or Bobby Kennedy speak. There is a difference. There is a profound difference. I disagree with many things Roosevelt advocated, but I would vote for him in a heartbeat because, after one speech, you knew what he stood for AND you knew he was doing what he genuinely believed to be right. Conviction matters. 

I'm not voting for someone I genuinely believe will be a detriment to society. You can say that I'm wrong, or short-sighted, or plain crazy, but that's my stance. You don't vote for the guy most likely to win. You find the smartest, most competent individual and try to get them elected. If that means you vote third party in the hopes that someone, somewhere will take notice of your candidate and help them make a better showing in 2020, I think that is the more responsible course of action.

It states a) that a no-deal Brexit is now a “likely scenario”, b) and that should it happen, “sectoral mini-deals are not an option”. The most traumatic exit will be imposed. 

If you are an American hedge fund and/or a Japanese life insurer, what conclusion do you draw about the solvency of the European banking system, or the risk that debt-deflation will lead to a cascade of sovereign defaults?

Edward Harrison from Credit Writedowns in the US is not alone in wondering whether the logic of this brinkmanship might prove to be Europe’s “Lehman moment”.

The European Central Bank can - presumably - handle the immediate shock of a financial and trade rupture by relaunching bond purchases and compressing Italian yields. What the ECB cannot handle is a third economic recession in a decade. This will lead to a credit crunch and play havoc with Club Med debt dynamics.

Let us call it creeping Lehmanisation - until the dam breaks and risk spreads go non-linear.

Taken literally, the EU’s Brexit position implies barriers (certification, delays etc) on imports of Airbus components for factories in Toulouse and Hamburg. Every wing is built in the UK at a hi-tech plant in Broughton and there are no stockpiles.

Airbus has already stated that a full breakdown in cross-channel trade would lead to losses of €1bn a week. The supply chain would “fall apart”. Some 4,000 UK firms supply more than 10,0000 aircraft parts. These include Rolls-Royce engines. The biggest industrial venture in Europe with 108,000 employees would be hobbled for as long as Brussels stuck to its hard-line policy.

Right now the eurozone is in deepening industrial recession. IHS Markit’s manufacturing PMI fell to a six-year low in March. Germany has seen the worst industrial deterioration since the eurozone banking crisis in July 2012. What happens if the EU impose customs clearance costs on Mercedes parts from suppliers in Coventry-Birmingham in these circumstances?

Academic trade models suggest that Germany can weather the trade shock of 10pc tariffs on 750,000 German cars sold each year to Britain. The models imply that the loss or disruption of €380bn of EU exports to the UK each year is manageable.

What these models do not capture are financial feedback loops that can amplify shocks. If your banking system is broken, this is exactly what you will get.

Negative rates have squeezed net interest margin of the banks to a wafer thin 1.65pc. They cannot generate enough income by borrowing short to lend long. The rate of return on equity for German banks is 2.9pc - a fifth of US levels. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are trading at a price-to-book ratio of 0.3.

The economic slowdown of the last year has already led to a 33pc fall in the STOXX 600 euro banks index. Most Italian banks have been shut out of the capital markets.

Europe never cleared up its banking system after the Lehman crisis. The legacy is a fragile edifice with non-performing loans of €700bn.

Germany and the Hanseatic League have blocked joint debt issuance. There is no pan-EMU deposit insurance or risk sharing for bank resolution. The sovereign/bank ""doom loop"" remains much as before. It will be tested in Italy where the banks still hold €370bn of Italian state bonds, and the state must roll over or raise €400bn of debt over the next year (€225bn medium and long-term). Deep recession will automatically cause Italy’s debt ratio to ratchet upwards into uncharted terrain.

The problem for Emmanuel Macron as he fans the flames of a no-deal Brexit is that his banks own a large chunk of Italy’s debt through subsidiaries. Total French exposure is 12 times French GDP, six times its exposure to Greece in 2010.

Mr Macron’s other problem is that France has shot up the debt league. Combined public, household, and corporate debt has jumped by 67 percentage points of GDP since 2007.

The EU’s Stability Pact blocks fiscal stimulus a l’outrance. The ECB cannot legally or politically resort to ""helicopter money"" to fight deflation. The Bank of England and the Treasury operating together can do whatever they want.

Let us presume that the EU’s no-deal talk is just bluster, and that Chancellor Merkel will impose common sense. The most likely outcome is that the EU will grant a further Brexit extension without extreme conditions whatever happens in Parliament this week.

If not, remember the words uttered by Mr Macron’s finance minister Bruno Lemaire: “If there was a new financial and economic crisis tomorrow, the eurozone could not respond. It is really urgent that we build-up the eurozone’s defences.”

That was three months ago. Nothing has changed since then.

**The forecasts have been over-egged and may not be so destructive**

*By Jeremy Warner*

Let’s for the moment rise above the politics of a hard, no-deal Brexit, which remain fluid and impossible to predict, and assume this is where sooner or later we end up. In analysing the economic consequences, it is important to distinguish between the short and the long-term impact. Given the general lack of preparedness, the short-term effects are likely to be bloody.

This is not just because of the expected disruption to UK trade, but also because of the spill-over consequences for the European economy as a whole, already teetering on the brink of outright recession.

What the Lehman bankruptcy did was turn what had previously been a serious recession and mortgage crisis into an economic catastrophe. It caused a sudden stop both in global finance and trade, and consequently a deep and immediate contraction in output.

To my mind, a no-deal Brexit is unlikely to have quite such destructive consequences. It is an anticipated event; the banking system is fully prepared, we are assured, and that in itself makes a hard Brexit very different from the Lehman’s bust. A lot of trade will also continue to take place regardless, albeit on different terms.

Nonetheless, there is no denying the considerable disruption involved. The Bank of England’s worst case scenario, which actually envisages a deeper slump than that associated with the financial crisis, with an ongoing, permanent impairment to output, is framed around these immediate, disruptive impacts.

But the Bank also makes some quite extreme assumptions - basically that everything that could possibly go wrong does - and is therefore something we don’t have to worry about too much.

The difficulty comes in assessing how much of the hit to trade rebounds on the rest of the European Union, creating a self feeding spiral of economic contraction, with recession and discord on the Continent further accentuating a likely dip in UK activity.

This is not a good time for disruption of this sort. Unlike the financial crisis, or the slightly later eurozone debt crisis, central banks have little in the way of ammunition to fight a sustained downturn. The ECB already has a negative interest rate.

Turning to the longer term consequences, these too may have become somewhat over-egged. Some forecasts are little more than scaremongering. Others suffer from the opposite problem.

Mervyn King, former Governor of the Bank of England, has gone out on a limb to say there will be virtually no long term impact. Few in mainstream economics agree. Leaving Europe’s customs union would impose extra costs on roughly half of Britain’s exports, and would also affect quite a bit of the rest.

Besides losing zero tariffs on exports to the EU, Britain would also surrender the benefits of almost all the EU’s existing trade agreements, covering 82 countries.

International trade is not everything; exports to the EU are a relatively minor component of GDP - only 13pc.  The fact is that you don’t need to be in a customs union to trade intensely with your next door neighbour.


Even so, it remains quite a stretch to think that there won’t be any long term costs at all. Bertlesmann Stiftung, a German think tank, recently estimated the downside at 2.39pc of GDP. These costs are assumed to be mainly in the form of mark-ups and productivity erosion. Compounded over time, they would add up to a big number.

Often forgotten in these assessments is the impact on inward investment, which is also likely to be negative. Most big manufacturers are holding back on next cycle investment plans to see what happens. If the main attraction for foreign investors is unfettered access to European markets, then there would be little point in staying after a hard Brexit. Many would concentrate their production elsewhere - particularly relatively low cost Eastern Europe.

Where Lord King might be correct, however, is that virtually all the modelling that underpins the gloom necessarily assumes nothing else will change. In reality, policy and behaviour will change quite markedly to compensate. Manufacturing will also gain some sort of a benefit from a lower pound.

If Brexit becomes a Lehman’s moment for Europe, then the UK too will be dragged down along with everyone else. But if the immediate consequences are contained, then the long term impact, though not great, also looks manageable.

[],UnmeshDatta26,1541616133.0,,modtrial,[],,Trial Moderator,dark,text,t2_2hey6feu,False,"For me, this is how I would make my list. 

1. KennyS: There was a time in history when he was unbeatable. He could do things with the AWP that you couldn't do if you tried it a million times. He moved and sniped faster than anybody could, and he pulled off the most awesome plays ever. He is incredibly respected, even after the fall of G2, and he will remain a legendary AWPer, even if his reign was short-lived. (RIP Pre-Nerf KennyS)

2. s1mple: He has been blowing up the world post-AWP-nerf and he has been posting insane stats for a really long time now. One year, sure it might be just a good year. Two years, consistency. Three years, and that tells you how good he has been and how long his peak has been. He has been carrying a sub-par team to finals and semis of every tournament possible. He has reimagined what talent can look like at the highest level. He is the most influential AWPer of the post-AWP-nerf CS:GO. 

3. dev1ce: He has been fighting incredibly hard, through his illnesses and injuries, to make his career an awesome one. His style is incredible and he displays traits that make him a very dangerous AWPer on any side. He thinks the game at a higher level than most people, and he can AWP really well too. He has become more mobile and his team allows him to move around a lot. He can support a rifler and he can become the prime focus of the attack. He is insanely versatile and he is a true gem.

4. FalleN: This guy has been the face of a region for so long now. Think of South American CS. The first name that always comes up is FalleN. He has revolutionized what CS can look like in countries that don't have an established scene. Regardless of that, his AWPing is incredible. He has shown that time and again, at his peak, he can carry his team and lead it at the same time. It is hard to AWP effectively while listening to team comms. It is harder to lead your team in comms while sniping players from across the map. His skill is undeniable and he is a legend. 

5. GuardiaN: At his peak, you don't want to face him. You really don't. He can ace you and you won't have a clue what happened. That's how good he his. GuardiaN has changed a lot over the years, from the chubby cheeked kid ruling the EU AWPing scene to now playing for FaZe, where he destroys teams on his best days. His best days might be here, but we can't see it. He has been lackluster for the last year, but it is hard to deny that at his prime, even Kenny would be a bit scared of facing him.

Notable mention, Markeloff: I understand that he doesn't have an awesome resume in CS:GO. But what I know about his pre-CSGO days is that he was a monster. He was beyond a lot of the others. He was top ranked every year and he was dangerous as hell. A lot of AWPers still probably call him the best they'd seen in the past. His style doesn't exactly translate into CS:GO, but his peak was huge for the AWPing world. 

For my rankings, it became hard to go between 4 and 5. Dev1ce and s1mple get the nod over GuardiaN and FalleN because of the titles they have accumulated and the success they have had. FalleN hasn't been able to win consistently since 2016/2017 and GuardiaN has been very unlucky in his career. 4 and 5 are very close to me, even if the number difference is 1. For me, KennyS' prime is what every AWPer dreams of. He was way too good for anybody. Noscopes and flicks for days. I know that s1mple does all of it and more. KennyS did it at a time where no one could come close to his stature. And he won a Major for his efforts, after bombing out of one. To me, Kenny is one of those guys that you name and you think to the countless KennyS fragmovies you've watched, even when you're a professional player.

It did in fact, once hold that it was wrong for Catholics to vote in Italian elections. The church has taken a poor stance on a few issues in the past, and the excommunication of communists could have been understood as a tragic necessity given the militant atheism of some communist parties in Europe. Yet most Communists today abhor the militant atheists of yesteryear, in which case the chief problem between the Church and Communists can be resolved peacefully.

&gt;Yes it is, it's a purely materialist ideology which doesn't allow for anything ""higher"" than itself, i.e. religion.

Again, Marx was for the Freedom of Religion even as he was an Atheist.

&gt;You can't believe that everything is material yet also somehow there's a spiritual or supernatural reality, it's obviously incompatible.

Even if you do believe in a God that transcends the material, as I do, is that a free pass to ignore the material? Can we just shove our heads in the sand, and pretend that Marx's critique of Capitalism just doesn't exist? Is that Christianity to you? Cupping your hands to your ears and pretending that problems don't exist if those problems seemingly only have a materialist basis? Does a devil have to take food from a man before we realize that man is starving and need our help? Does a demon have to be behind a murder before we solve the murder and punish the guilty?

&gt;Which raises the question: if it's an inevitability why bother arguing for it?

The collapse of Capitalism is an inevitability. From there we have a choice between Socialism or Barbarism. Thus we must argue relentlessly for Socialism, and hope to achieve it before the total collapse of Capitalism does any more damage to the world. The coming environmental collapse that we've selfishly done nothing to prevent will lead to millions of dead humans. The total collapse of Capitalism is going to lead to *billions*. Worse than that, we may see a few maniacle fascists take drastic measures and drag us into another World War, and do you want to see what a war with nuclear arms and modern death machines would do? Do you want to imagine what horrors Nazi Germany would come up with, if it only had access to modern technology?

&gt;I wouldn't waste my time trying to convince people that the sun will set tonight.

You ever study the history of the Easter Islands? It's a fascinating thing really. The natives completely deforested their tiny little island and caused a total environmental collapse. Within the span of a few generations their numbers had so thoroughly diminished that they resorted to cannibalism and inbreeding. 

I like to imagine, to some extent, that a few tribes people saw that less and less trees could be found each year, that there was a diminishing amount of food, and they argued--*pleaded*--with their fellows to use what little resources they had to escape on ships and find land elsewhere, or to restrain themselves, only to hear ""We don't have to do that, no collapse is coming! The gods will protect us!"" Or ""When we can find no more trees and have nothing left to eat, only *then* will we look for new land and restrain ourselves!""

That kind of backwards thinking, sadly, is the general attitude of most people living in our spectacularly wealthy society. When faced with the stress of an ideology that doesn't even *make* any biting critique of our faith, whose abhorred ""materialism"" is **no more material than the society we're living in right now** and may in fact end up being *less* materialist than our late-stage capitalism, what do we do? We pretend we can go on ignoring it, we condemn our grandchildren and children to suffering, if not ourselves, and such an apathy to coming tragedy is abhorrent to any Christianity worthy of the name ""Christian"".",True,False,False,,0,1554272499,,False,0,{},ek08nq3,True,t3_b7m37x,False,True,t1_ejydxll,/r/TrueCatholicPolitics/comments/b7m37x/conceptualizing_a_catholic_position_in_communism/ek08nq3/,False,,1557302389,0,True,False,TrueCatholicPolitics,t5_3ltgh,r/TrueCatholicPolitics,public,0.0,

Det var jo det, der lykkedes i Danmark med det nationale kompromis. Det lykkedes bl.a. fordi ingen af aktørerne spillede dobbeltspil. Og var villige til at tage chancer med deres eget omdømme. Særligt SF var meget sårbare, og det kostede dem livstruende partikampe de følgende 10 år. Den slags politikere findes åbenbart ikke i England?

&gt;En ny afstemning (forudsat man bliver enige om hvad der skal stemmes om) kan lyde som en rar løsning -- men det er godtnok svært at vurdere hvordan det vil påvirke det britiske demokrati på lang sigt.

Thats not how inflation works. Inflation is how products change in price over time.

&gt;But to get more into on germanies inflation. Fact is, product prices have gone up exponentially. You can read that up anywhere. Where a block of butter cost you roughly 0.84 EUR it now costs 1.3 EUR. The usual defense for EUR folk is ""but wages have also gone up!""

cause that is the case. Every country has inflation (and not from 0.84-&gt;0.3 over the past decades isnt ""exponentially"")

As for inflation itself:

https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm

Germany has lower inflation than the UK since 2000.

&gt;And that's where the statistical skewing comes into place. Yes, wages have gone up. But for whom? With a constantly vanishing middle class, we're left with the poor who don't really earn more on their wages ( they still labour around the so called existenzminimum, the bare minimum him you need to survive at current calculated prices), And those who are well above middle class raking in well above 3000-4000 EUR a month.

Poverty rate is aactually lower in germany (and most EU countries) compared to the UK

https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm

As is the poverty gap and the Income inequality

https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-gap.htm#indicator-chart

So this isnt a german problem (nor is this due to the EU) this is a general problem thats actually a lot worse in non Euro countries like the UK/USA. This is more historical/cultural and has little to do with EU/euro.

In reality for wages germany has done quite wel the past decade:

https://tippingpointnorthsouth.org/2016/08/05/real-wages-in-the-uk-have-fallen-by-more-than-10-per-cent/

&gt;The article you linked on roaming btw has a clear passage in it that says that your company can still charge you for EU roaming, just that it's way lower then it used to be (6 EUR per GB).

Only once you go over your own limit and even thats cheaper then before. Again its a clear advantage that you cannot admit that just shows a total irrational bias  .

&gt;And fair in my case is a very subjective idea of a non-sabotage minded approach to trade with the UK. Although standard WTO rules would probably be the common denominator here

WTO rules is not ""sabotage"" and that is what the UK would get without a deal. It will entail quite a lot of chaos as suddenly everyone has to start with custom documents/checks/...

Again what EU is doing has nothing to do with sabotage, it has everything to do with protecting its own market. It can only have a free trade deal with someone if its sure what kind of products that will put on the EU market to make sure there is no unfair competition . Of course that means the UK would still have to follow EU rules/regulations just like everyone that has free acces to the EU market.",True,False,False,,0,1554275615,,1554275875,0,{},ek0apcg,False,t3_b8gqax,False,True,t1_ejzkk0o,/r/worldpolitics/comments/b8gqax/uk_parliament_rejects_alternatives_to_mays_brexit/ek0apcg/,False,,1557303344,1,True,False,worldpolitics,t5_2qh9a,r/worldpolitics,public,0.0,

&gt; Japan will begin the unprecedented holiday on 27 April, days before Emperor Akihito abdicates to make way for his eldest son, Naruhito, whose Reiwa reign will begin on 1 May. The holiday will finally end on 6 May. Last December parliament passed a bill approving the break to celebrate the change in the occupant of the Chrysanthemum throne, which coincides with the traditional &amp;quot;Golden Week&amp;quot; holiday in early May. The travel industry is experiencing a windfall, with bookings for overseas trips - particularly long-haul flights to Europe - already far exceeding those in an average year.

&gt; &amp;quot;For parents in the service sector, the 10 days of holiday is a headache. After-school care, nurseries - everything is closed,&amp;quot; one anxious parent tweeted.

&gt; Japanese workers take fewer annual paid holidays than their counterparts in comparable countries, according to a survey conducted late last year.

Membership of the European Union has been a topic of debate in the United Kingdom since the country joined the European Communities (or ""the Common Market"", as it was usually then known) in 1973. This referendum was conducted very differently from the European Communities membership referendum in 1975; a more localised and regionalised counting procedure was used, and the ballot was overseen by the Electoral Commission, a public body which did not exist at the time of the first vote. This article lists, by voting area for Great Britain and Gibraltar and by parliamentary constituency for Northern Ireland, all the results of the referendum, each ordered into national and regional sections.

Dar organizația politică care se numește Uniunea Europeană, la care suntem și noi membri, de bine de rău, are instrumentele  - dacă nu să stopeze, măcar să atenueze derapajele de la valorile pe care ni le-am asumat când ne-am alăturat ei. Și, da, aș vrea mai multă acțiune din partea UE. Blame me, pls.

I am highly skeptical of that statement for a simple reason, human evolution is very slow compared to cultural evolution and we are known to use most of the spices that are used today relatively recently. Europeans were not in contact with red peppers (capsaicin) before like 14th century, it's taste was completely alien to them. I believe last known evolutionary change was ability to digest lactose as [adults happened between 2450 and 2140 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence#Europe). Our cooking strategies evolved much faster than our biology and it happened largely independent in different cultures. My point is that you are overstating the role of pure evolution in all this, as in that if something tastes good the only reason is that we evolved to enjoy it because it is useful. Evolution probably plays a role in taste forming, but you can't attribute everything to it because it just doesn't add up time wise.

It is impossible to state there is not gender bias in hearthstone. Most of the time people are unaware of their bias against women, and they way they treat them because of it.

Here is a great example of gender bias against women musicians from Malcom Gladwells Blink.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The world of classical music – particularly in its European home – was until very recently the preserve of white men…But over the past few decades, the classical music world has undergone a revolution…Many musicians thought that conductors were abusing their power and playing favorites. They wanted the audition process to be formalized…Musicians were identified not by name but by number. Screens were erected between the committee and the auditioner, and if the person auditioning cleared his or her throat or made any kind of identifiable sound…they were ushered out and given a new number. And as these new rules were put in place around the country, an extraordinary thing happened: orchestras began to hire women. \[pp. 249-250\]

&amp;#x200B;

Referring to a women french horn player in a screened audition

&gt;“Until they listened to her with just their ears, however, they had no idea she was so good. When the screen created a pure *Blink* moment, a small miracle happened, the kind of small miracle that is always possible when we take charge of the first two seconds: they saw her for who she truly was.” (p. 254)

And they were surprised to find out it was not a man.

Title: **Upstairs neighbor keeps throwing cigarettes onto my balcony and has tried to break in twice while drunk**

Original Post: 

&gt; European here so sorry in advance for any grammer errors
&gt; 
&gt; Moved in to this appartment about 9 months ago and since the first week my upstairs neighbor has thrown cigarettes and also flicks a lot of ash onto the balcony daily. 
&gt; 
&gt; I started by trying to contact said neighbor by knocking on his door on 3 separate  occasions but recieved no response except for the last one where i overheard him from my balcony saying ""Some black guy has knocked on my door for 3 days straight, im not going to open"". 
&gt; 
&gt; After that i tried to contact the landlord but she responded with a single sentence that she would look into it so i dont think it was that big of a concern to her. About 5 months after i moved in the same neighbor tried to get into my appartment while extreamly intoxicated on a sunday afternoon, My little brother was with me at the time. After that i tried once again contacting the landlord which responded with the exact same line as the last time, ""Ill look into it"". 
&gt; 
&gt; The exact same thing happened on a sunday a few weeks ago where the neighbor tried to get into my appartment for a few minutes until i opened the door. This time i was really angry so i shouted at him and he responded with trying to fight me and at that point i shut my door and he remained outside and started to bang on the door with his fists for a few minutes. Once again i tried to contact the landlord but recieved the exact same respons as if it was automated almost.
&gt; 
&gt; I have run out of ideas on how to fix this and if the landlord is not going to help i feel like i have to take matters into my own hands to make this stop but i dont know how.

That answers your first 3 questions. 

A quick rundown; 1) the people elect their National Parliaments and the European Parliament (who then elects a president of the Parliament) 

2) the National Parliaments elect the National governments 

3) the National Governments then propose the European Court of Auditors, elect the European Court of Justice and the Council of Ministers

3.5) Council of Ministers decides whether they like the proposed Court of Auditors. 

4) the Heads of State form the European Council and elect a president of that council. 

5) the Council then proposes their chosen Commission and the President of the Commission. 

6) the European Parliament then decided on whether they are comfortable with the Commission that has been proposed. 

7) Commission propose legislation, Parliament and Council of Ministers vote on that legislation. 

The Commission proposed by the Council will generally be decided based on the ideals and legislation the candidates want to propose. 

Generally, candidates who propose legislation that the populace of each state want are the ones who get put on the Commission. 

As the Commission is approved by the European Parliament, it can be vetoed and voted out by the European Parliament and a new Commission can be drawn up. 

The reason I think this project has a bright future (despite ridiculous legislation that passed recently. You can bet those people are praying they don't lose their seats) is because it pulled the UK out of the gutter in the 70s. 

It has given Europe a united voice on the world stage. It has ensured we don't get steamrolled by the US and China.

It has ensured Europe is the largest single market on the planet. 

We now uphold agreements where if one country of the EU is moved against by an adversary, we will mobilise our forces as one to assist them and defend them. 

In the video, that is not Juncker. That is Guy Verhofstadt.
He also never stated ""abolish state sovereignty"". 

He was warning against the rise of Eurosceptics who wanted to undo the work the EU had done in providing Europe with a voice in the world. 

He was warning the European Parliament about regressing and moving away from the policies it has put in place, such as Freedom of Movement, one of the core principles of the EU. 

Freedom of Movement (also known as Schengen) is a policy that allows any EU citizen the RIGHT to work, live and travel to any other EU country unhindered (provided that country is part of Schengen. It's not mandatory, as the UK and Ireland are not part of Schengen). 

FoM has boosted the economies of countries all over the EU. 

Just one benefit is the enhanced co-operation it allows between our academics, greatly improving our research output.

Third flaw is thinking that a fucking protest vote is going to work in your favour. Plenty of people in the UK thought protest voting was a good idea and we ended up with the shit show that is brexit.

So how exactly are you planning on stopping these people from getting into Europe? A wall? A fence? A line of EU troops with MG emplacements?

Imagine, the post soviet states would ask america why they are propping up soviet dictator defenders. 

The socialists would most likely agree, because only fuckwads defend the soviet style dictators, and honestly speaking, they can be socialist without being fuckwards. All it takes is a socialist approach. 

Now, that would be the national climate without going political. 

But since you live in a 2 party state, you don't have a classical will of the people. 

So, as soon as the issue comes up, the socialist haters of the republicans go, you know what, that is EXACTLY what we should be doing, lets double down on this, and lets remove all posturing from the discussion, you are either for america, ort you are actively trying to destroy america. being for america means socialism must die. This is just how we relax. After all, all of the ex soviet states agree, any root of socialism and communism is bad. 

And the left, who for the most parts is actually pretty relaxed, closes ranks, and doubles down on the marxist roots, and goes, full collectivisation, and they introduce a 51'st pronoun, comrade. 

With the predictable results that the actual idea behind the entire issue, to make what you have just a little bit better, gets lost behind the political posturing, with both parties going, Well, actually, what happened was the other sides fault, we would like to dial our posiotion back a bit, but since they went full out on their position, and have doubled down, why should we be reasonable? 

Criticism works as long as you have a space for compromise. Otherwise, it's just you yelling at the top of your voice why the other side isn't following your lead. While rthe top argument of them is not, ""They actually want to make what we have better"", it is ""They are just political posturing, why should we bend to that even one iota. ""

You want a solution? Punch everyone who goes, my way or the highway in the mouth, untill they drop out of the discussion, no matter what side they are on. You are america, not denmark or germany 2.0. You have states the size of nation states. You are required to find a way that is right for america, not for sovietistan or for france.

EU agrees to define Gibraltar as a ""colony"" in its post-Brexit visa policy
Europa Press
6-7 minutes

EP negotiators accuse 27 of intransigence for rejecting alternatives to Spain's proposed wording


The Council and the European Parliament have reached a principle of agreement to define Gibraltar as a ""British Crown colony"" in the visa waiver policy that will apply to British citizens after Brexit, when the European Parliament lifted its veto on Wednesday, after its negotiator, British MEP Claude Moraes, was dismissed on Monday for resisting the wording defended by the EU-27 - at the behest of Spain.

The new law has yet to be submitted to the plenary session of the European Parliament on Thursday, but the conditions of the reform have already been approved by the Council at the level of ambassadors - on Tuesday - and MEPs in the competent parliamentary committee - this Wednesday -.

The reform had been blocked since February by the refusal of the negotiating team of the European Parliament to accept the footnote that was introduced by the Council in the regulation to describe Gibraltar as a ""colony of the British Crown"" over which there is a ""dispute"" between Spain and the United Kingdom.

This controversy, adds the finally accepted note, must find a solution ""in the light of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations"".

This reference was not contained in the initial proposal of the European Commission, which, however, saw no problems in it because it interpreted it as a clarification of a situation already known, in line with the jurisprudence of the EU Court of Justice (TEU) and that ""does not alter in any way"" the status of the Rock with respect to the EU. The EU Treaties already refer to Gibraltar as ""a European territory whose external relations are assumed by a Member State"".

But Labour MEP Moraes, who has been Parliament's rapporteur in five rounds of negotiations until he is replaced, has criticised the ""intransigence"" of European governments to come up with an alternative wording, for which he said he had presented up to three different proposals, all rejected.

His replacement on Tuesday at the negotiating table, the Bulgarian MEP and vice-president of the LIBE committee, Sergei Stanishev, has joined these criticisms in the parliamentary session in which the reform was voted, noting that the Twenty-seven ""had no will"" to seek consensus and rejected a fourth proposal on Tuesday, drafted taking into account the jurisprudence of the TEU.

Stanishev praised Moraes' negotiating efforts and accused EU countries of choosing a ""suicidal"" strategy to put Parliament at the crossroads of accepting his proposal unchanged or overturning an urgent rule at the risk of a chaotic Brexit on 12 April.

""The fate of millions of British and European citizens is in our hands,"" said Stanishev, calling on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to approve the agreement.

MEPs then adopted the reform in the terms defended by the Council, with 38 votes in favour, 8 against and 3 abstentions. The expectation for this vote was reflected in the high attendance at the session, with the President even having to ask several groups to withdraw some of their representatives in order to prevent them from casting more votes than they were entitled to.

The reform will include the United Kingdom in the list of countries exempted from the requirement of short-stay visas (up to 90 days) for its citizens. The change is a ""unilateral"" EU decision to mitigate the most serious damage to Brexit and is conditional on London processing an equivalent exemption for Europeans.

REACTIONS

The reference to Gibraltar as a British colony is a claim by Spain which wants to make it clear in the European texts that the legal situation of the territory when Brexit occurs, and therefore ceases to apply European law, must be framed again within the resolutions of the United Nations.

Pedro Sánchez's government and Spanish MEPs on the LIBE committee doubted during the visa reform negotiations that British Labour's Moraes could represent the EU's interests impartially.

MEPs of other nationalities, however, reacted in public debates to defend Moraes and point out that he obeyed a mandate approved by the MEP commission unanimously, ie including with the support of Spanish MEPs. Finally, on Monday the European People's Party (EPP) and Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) forced their change.

""Spain has achieved a fundamental support of the European institutions in the dispute over Gibraltar by considering this territory a colony"", said in a statement the spokesman of the PP in the Parliament, Esteban Gonzalez Pons, for whom this change ""will be essential to try to resolve the dispute over this territory in a post-Brexit scenario.

Maite Pagazaurtundúa, an MEP from the UPyD, stressed that the solution agreed by the EU involves calling the Rock ""by its name"", as it reflects the way in which it indicates ""European jurisprudence and the UN"", and therefore believes that it defends ""the obvious"".

Citizen MEP Javier Nart also applauded in a statement that has unblocked the situation and argued that the definition responds to the need to act in a manner consistent with international law and European doctrine. ""This qualification will be decisive in future negotiations with the United Kingdom on Gibraltar,"" he said.

""Spain has validated the commitment obtained in the agreement on the Brexit so that its position is decisive in any European decision affecting Gibraltar,"" said the Socialist Juan Fernando López Aguilar in a statement.

How the hell is brexit to fix that? The idea that brexit will lower immigration to sustainable levels is another idea that looks good on the surface but peel back one layer and it's a load of crap.

Brexit will reduce net migration away from the UK as British citizens will no longer be able to work easily on the closest continent. This will increase net migration.

While we pull up the drawbridge to EU citizens coming here to work we have, at the same time, said ""to all you third world countries, we need a trade deal and we are going to be needing one quick"". India have made noises that in order for us to have a trade deal with them we need to relax Indian visa restrictions. We will be swapping one group of immigrants for another. This will be the case for every country we want a trade deal with who wants access for their workers to our skilled sector and educational institutions. 

At the same time we will be causing a shock to our economy that will make austerity even harder, making everyone's lives worse.

We're considered white now and we're very priveleged and all that but our history is full of racism. Even Charles Darwin wrote about how we're a lesser race that's related more to Africans than Anglos or Europeans. There was drawings of Anglo-Irish (protestants that settled here) shown next to drawings of Catholic-Irish and it's similar to racist drawings people used to make of Africans, big brow, hunched over, a bit apish in appearance. A British politician during the Great Famine said it was a blessing from God to reduce the numbers of the savage Irish.

Essentially everyone thought that white people were smarter and better and that's why they were on top so when faced with the pastiest, whitest people on the planet that were also poor and oppressed, they just said ""well, they're not white then"". 

Racism between people of the same skin colour isnt that unique though. The Armenian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide and the Holocaust were all racially motivated genocides committed by people of the same colour with only slightly different ethnic groups. I feel like in a melting pot like America, it starts getting hard to identify the differences that you can feel better than someone for, so over time Italians, Irish and so on blended in too much for people to keep up the hate. Black people still get it because their skin colour is an easy identifier people can use to say ""I'm better than that person"". Shows how superficial the reasons for it are, really. 

Racist Irish people annoy me so much for this reason, we used to be in a similar position but it only took a couple of generations for people to forget.

&gt; And if that happens.. potentially the queens speech doesnt pass which is a vote of no confidence... which is a new election.

&gt; Or...They get through a queens speech but cant do anything (especially if they have a small majority) because of rebellions and it leads too.... a new election.

I think the key issue with equating a second referendum to a GE is that neither of the two potential governing parties was supporting 'Leave'. There was never going to be a majority in the HoC for Brexit. I'm not one to scream ""Traitors!!1!"" at MPs, but I can see why some people feel let down. Should the incompetence of those who never wanted to leave (I'm including both May and Corbyn in this group) be reason enough to say Brexit has failed and that we ought to pursue a 2nd referendum?

Also, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to pursue Brexit in the run-up of the 2017 GE. If we are so keen on politicians keeping to their promises, then surely so should May and Corbyn?

&gt; No deal brexit was explicitly ruled out by the leave campaign. And is a beautiful sign of how the goal posts have moved, and therefore the result can be set aside. Thank leavers for that ammunition.

&gt; Not only that, it is utterly moronic according to basically everyone.

&gt; I want a credible plan that meets all the promises of the leave campaign. It wont happen because it cant

Sure. But Cameron also promised to ""promptly"" trigger Article 50 if we voted to leave. He also claimed that leaving meant leaving the Single Market.

We didn't trigger Article 50 ""promptly"" and there is still votes/discussion surrounding EEA even though it was stated outright by Cameron that it was not a valid option to pursue following a 'Leave' victory.

Osbourne stated there would be an emergency budget in place as soon as we voted to leave. Clegg said that the idea of a unified EU army was laughable.

The campaigns for both sides were so large (and consisted of supporters from different parties) that it would be impossible to expect either side to have met all the promises made by either 'Remain' or 'Leave'. The 'Labour In for Britain' campaign was different from the Conservative 'Britain Stronger in Europe' campaign, just like how Vote.EU was different from Farage's Grassroots Out.

&gt; Because it was advisory. Therefore other things can be taken into account.

&gt; If you want to include constitutional motive as a reason for leaving (because all other arguments for leaving have collapsed under the face of reality) then thats fine. But you cant assume all 17.4million people voted for those reasons when all these other positives were ignored.

&gt; If it was even 90% (which is generous number) that voted for constitutional reasons. And the other 10% voted for all the other bullshit... there goes your win.

&gt; Im not saying there is an equation. But it creates an argument.

I agree with you that there is no way every one of the 17.4 million people who voted for 'Leave' did so with the same idea in mind. However, how can you then be sure that everyone who voted Remain did so with the same idea in mind?

What if, I was someone who wanted to leave the EU but wanted to remain in the EEA. Yet when Cameron said we would be leaving the EEA (if we voted to Leave), I chose to vote for Remain as I didn't want to leave the EEA (so EEA &gt; Current Membership &gt; Hard Brexit)

What if, I only voted Remain to preserve the Union (and not see Scotland leave) and then it turns out that Scotland still don't want to leave the Union (as polls seem to currently suggest)

Personally, I decided to vote Remain (whilst holding my nose) as even though I detest many of the ECJ's rulings and how the EU has been attempting to expand their competences, I did not want our economy to take such a dramatic hit. But if leaving only means slightly slower growth in the short to medium term (I'm not saying that this will be the case) and I knew that prior to voting, I'd have chosen Leave.

&gt; Because here is the next 10 to 20 years if we leave. in any way

&gt; Some things go wrong. Some things go right

&gt; Of the things that go wrong, some will be because of brexit. Some won't.

&gt; But almost everything will be blamed on brexit, just like it was all be blamed on the EU over the ladt 40 years.

&gt;People will start to think ""x wouldn't have happened if only we were in the EU""

Agreed. If we leave in any form whatsoever, it is going to overshadow political debate for decades to come.

&gt; Leavers will slowly die of.

&gt; Remainers will grow into the ruling age group.

&gt; The majority for rejoining will build

&gt; And we will rejoin an have to accept a deal worse than our current deal.

&gt; Is it really worth the economic damage, and the loss of the opt outs, the veto of the next few stages of EU changes and potentially the pound for a decade or two of not being in the EU?

This is where I disagree. Although all I can do is predict, if in the years to come the EU does transition more into a federal state than just a politicial and economic union, then I see the prospects of us rejoining to be quite unlikely. I'd bet that even a majority of remainers have no interest in being part of a federalised Europe as it was something to the Remain campaign shied from consistently. They weren't offering a grand dream of a 'United States of Europe' but continued to stress that our current deal was the most preferable option.

""La Reconquista"" ends with the siege and capture of the last Islamic city, Granada.

Somewhere in eastern France, a girl's earing aid works too well nd she hears someone says that the brits need kicking out of France, so she picks up her robes, her staff and her sheep, marches to where the french prince is, kicks down the door, and says ""yo bitches, it's about time to bring down the baguette, who with me homies?"" With this very charismatic speach, Jeanne d'Arc rallies the french army, demoralized by lack of cheese, and leads them from victory to victory, before being captured and roasted by the brits. The french, enraged at the roasting of their Cheese Princess proceed to curbstomp the brits into oblivion with a vengeance, ending the 100 year wars after, ironically, 116 years of conflict (they took breaks, presumably so the brits could drink hot water, as they didn't yet have tea).

Some dude named Columbus can't get funding from his native Genoa because he can't seem to get the size of the planet right, and so fucks off to Spain to get funding, screamins out ""SIZE DOESN'T MATTER, MOM!"" before slamming the door. After pestering the spanish queen, he's given some ships and peasants so he'll shut up. Turns out that was a good investment, because he found islands on the other side of the big plus piss pool, so hey, moneyz maybe? A couple expeditions later, the verdict falls : Moneyz like fuuuuuuuuck. Cue the first wave of colonization, with Portugal jumping in, because fuck letting the spaniards get everything, right? After subjugating, forcefully converting and happily murderizing the natives, they bring back so much gold it crashes the economy, making life more difficult for everyone, especially the merchants that have to deal with french and british pirates horny for their gold. But did you think this was over for Europe, oooh no my pretties, now children, we reach the high point : RELIGIOUS WARS! \*children cheer\*

Around that time, some german preacher looked at the way the catholic church operated, and frowned, because that was decidedly offensive to his german sensibilities about order, budget and seriousness. In his humble opinion, you can't balance a budget with sins and gold, they're not the same unit and that whole ""indulgences"" business is bullshit, so he writes a really angry open letter, and nails it to the door of a church. Turns out, the ""indulgences"" business offensed many german sensibilities about budget, seriousness and order, and bam, you get a new sect of christianity, followed by a couple more. In pure catholic tradition, they are quickly declared heretical, which means it's time for some good ol' INQUISITIONNING! \*organ jingle of Inquisition Man\*

So, while the fanatically catholic spain rapes and burns in the americas, in Germany you rape and burn your naighbour for being a filthy heretic. Aaah, wholesome family activities, they are truly universal. Anyway, let's stop cooing at the adorable sight, we have work to do. So, after merrily slaughterizing each other, the various states of the HRE decide that, OK, we're all christans, maybe we can live together. Nah, nothing to do with the Ottomans stomping their way up the balkan's ass, nope.

Shortly after, Henry VIII of England decides that, hey, he doesn't like his wife and he wants out. The church say ""uuuh, till death do us parts, dude."" Henry answers with ""is that a challenge?"" and proceeds to make them part. However, after a couple times, it gets old, so he decides to make his own religion, the anglican church, and decides that he's the pope-equivalent (not compatible with catholic electrical circuits, please buy adaptator)

After that, it speeds up even more, the iberian colonies in the americas decide they wanna rule themselves, english and french colonies pop up, the Netherland gain independance and join the race, the HRE keeps being a bloody mess, the Ottomans are kicked back at Viennes by the largest cavalry charge in the history of cavalry charges, the british and french colonists can't keep it in their pants or the natives (equaly valid place for their swords at the time) and start stabbing each other, which results in more taxes, which makes the 13 colonies say ""FUCK YOU DAD!"" and make their own country (helped by the french navy, just to piss off the tea drinkers), the slave trade is established, the feudal system in europe fails more and more, industrial revolution starts (children! the best lubricant for your steam engines!) and spreads, France has a revolution that quickly turns very bloody, Napoleon fucks everything up, gets wrecked by a season, comes back, gets wrecked again, France finally starts to really use those steam thingies they hear so much about, the german state FINALLY look somewhat useable due to Napo going ""the fuck is this mess?"" and erasing the HRE, spain is traumatized by Napo's mistreatment of them (slaughters, who doesn't love them?), Napo's nephew pops his head up, declares himself Emperor and is quickly nut-kicked by Prussia (not!Germany), Italy gets somewhat closer to being united, and before long, it's WW1.

I did my best, but it's hard to summarize effectively about 1500 years of history without skipping too many steps. Also, this is a bit too France centric to my tastes, especially towards the end, but hey, countries are mostly interested in themselves, and I'm French. I tried to keep a general overview, but there are things I just don't know, and I sadly had to skip a fair few things.

I don't think he states his point well in this case (he's wrong basically), but perhaps he's alluding to the 2004 enlargement of the EU. There were migratory caps in place to prevent the EU-15's labour markets from being swamped by the 10 new countries joining the EU. Tony Blair's administration specifically waived those caps allowing UK labour markets to receive an influx of labour from the new EU members. It was a pretty controversial move at the time and in retrospect should've been done more gradually.
