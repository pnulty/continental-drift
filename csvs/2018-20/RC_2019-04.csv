Ms May then calling an *unnecessary* General Election backfired as the Tories lost their  overall majority leaving her unable to form a government without the support of the hard-line Brexiteer and all-round nasty DUP,  and made her hostage to fortune to hard-liners within her own party.

States in the US have certain powers that the federal government does not, and that sometimes sets up some interesting conflicts.

The country is very much agricultural,first off. But unlike countries such as Japan or European ones, agriculture still very much retains that feudal structure. Most land is owned by a few landowners, or hacienderos, a structure that first existed under Spanish colonialism. But feudal hacienda land ownership was very paternal. Farmers lived on the land and had a symbiotic relationship with the landowner. The farmers would till and cultivate the land, in exchange, the landowner would take care of the farmer; giving them loans at reasonable rates, sponsoring weddings, baptisms, fiestas, etc. The farmer would pay tribute in the form of a share of the profit from their crops.

US Imperialism changed the structure of this relationship by turning its focus towards capital. Farmers became tenant workers who work for a wage instead of owning their crops. Rice fields became sugarcane and tobacco fields which yielded more profit but weren't edible. Middlemen stepped in to deal with farmers while landowners grew rich in Manila, away from their farms. Bureaucracy created a system of land titles which left out illiterate farmers who owned their own land, leading to their subjugation by US colonizers and Filipino compradors. The old feudal relationship was gone and was replaced by a semi-feudal one. The haciendero was no longer the father of a community, he was the employer in a land-based industry. This is the relationship that exists until today. Foreign corporations and a select few families own almost all land in the Philippines, while farmers and farm workers get shafted in the name of capital.

Now, I will confess that I haven't done enough reading on other semi-feudal societies like Afghanistan or Africa, beyond going ""Hm, yes, that sounds like mine"". But from what I understand, the relationship of land in those countries are very similar. It's feudal, but it's run like a business. That's semi-feudal.

[],EagleCatchingFish,1470866522.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_10bxxn,False,"Let's think about it for a second. To make a gun, you need the machinery to do it. You can do a lot with jigs, CNCs and stuff, but to do it economically, you need dedicated machines, tooling, and factories. In Eastern Europe, they have that. In the US, there are starting to be more companies tooled up to make AKs, but even that's developing. For non-ak com-bloc guns, the domestic manufacturing base is pretty much non-existent.

So anyone looking to sell these com bloc guns has three options: 1) make small lots using jigs and programmable tools (and miss out on economies of scale), 2) import the parts you can, fabricate what you have to, build the gun and sell it (again, missing out on economies of scale), or 3) buy the tooling necessary, bring in experts from foreign manufacturers, and set up a factory to build domestic copies of the gun. Option 3 gives you economies of scale in manufacturing, but your supply chain would be really complicated while you deal with foreign suppliers of parts until you can develop domestic suppliers who can make the foreign designed parts. Option 3 is the most expensive, but if you could do it and the demand was there, you'd own the market because you could make the gun cheaper than anyone else domestically. 

In the automotive industry, you can see this in the premier asian auto brands. Lexus, for example, uses a bunch of Toyota parts which are made in NAFTA, but a lot are only made in ~~Tokyo~~ Japan. Toyota would develop more of a NAFTA-based supplier base, but it just doesn't make sense fiscally with the volumes they're dealing with.

&gt;no stake in civilization. There is nothing to preserve for their children, because they have none. So in a pure egotistical sense, being a liberal is more ""beneficial"" to them as individuals here and now. 

uh a lot of Democrats only vote for environmental issues now and I think preserving the ability of the planet to support life is pretty important for people who have children or not.  On the other hand I have personally seen way too many Conservatives who only vote against abortion to virtue signal to Jesus and think we should destroy the environment to bring the Rapture sooner..  I wish I was making that up.  

I think this sub needs to mention every once in a while that there are more white people on the planet than at any other time, and people should be able to not have kids if they don't want to..

I mean for millions of years humans had different strategies for dealing with these issues.  When civilized nations decided it was international law to not allow warfare for purpose of acquiring land, it kind of sealed the fate of those civilized nations.  Any new people have to be absorbed into what we already have, and it's just one of many reasons why people are not prioritizing reproduction right now.

But they BOTH could have been stopped in 1936 if the British and French had been a little bit less Isolationist, and had the balls to do something, the Japanese Navy was not at all the size of the combined French and British Navies, and would easily 10/10 be stomped by the Battle Tested Navies, while the Japanese would be ill experienced. 

The Germans in 1936 had the Army comparable to Romania and Italy, The German Army was still outnumbered by POLAND in September 1939, by like 100,000 Troops (Correct me if I am wrong) which is kind of hard to pull out of your Arse, and Britian and France stopped Poland from Mobilizing it's troops to stop the threat of a possible German Invasion in August, there again another possibility to stop the Hell that was WWII, and then The USSR gets away Scot free after also invading Poland which was ""Garuanteed"" by the Allies.

[],6K6L,1490377167.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16gp6e,False,"Other such encounters include a person Andris knew during his college years who, after observing a phone call made by Andris who was speaking in his native language to his mother, expressed his opinion that immigrants should not speak other languages in America besides English. According to Andris, this person’s view was that if immigrants were to assimilate properly into American society, they should be required to only speak English once they came to America, abandoning their previously known languages. Andris informed in his interview that he did not agree with this sentiment and was able to put aside and ignore these expressions without issue. This concept is something that many hear when discussing the radical ideology that racism and ethnocentrism can bring. Luckily this is not a concept that has been endorsed in major politics, as part of America’s identity as a nation is being able to accept cultures of all areas to a reasonable extent. People of different cultures cannot be expected to give up specific areas of their cultural heritage based on radical whims and wants that make little to no difference in the functioning of society. 

Another aspect of American culture mentioned by Andris is the diversity of both culture and race found in America, explaining that it “took a while to get used to”. This is to be expected, as Andris himself explained that the only minorities present in his country of origin were Russian and Polish denominations, along with some types of Gypsies. Andris further explained that he welcomed the change in ethnicity around him, as it was interesting for him to view so many cultures in one place. When talking about himself being an immigrant, Andris informed that he was surprised how few of the people around him actually knew of Latvia or Lithuania, and how many of the people he socialized with were interested in learning about the culture (foods, music, people, etc.) itself. One of the joys of living in America is being able to experience the cultures of so many races and ethnicities. Speaking from personal accounts from other Americans, Americans have been immersed in so many cultural identities for so long that it is often hard for them to conceptualize living in an area with only a few cultures present. This is sadly something that is too often taken for granted by many Americans, and further proves the need for the acceptance or at least understanding of foreign cultural aspects. 

When asked what kinds of relationships that he has built since coming to America, Andris explained that his relationships manifest in both American born citizens and immigrants alike. Particular preferences are made towards having relationships with Guatemalan, Nigerian, and Vietnamese friends. Andris voiced his hypothesis that perhaps immigrants are drawn towards each other because of their similarities, also but explains that it is comforting to hear from others about their immigration related experiences. Luckily for Andris there is a sociology/psychology-based theory that explains why people who have similar qualities tend to mingle with one another. Social comparison theory can be defined as the process of thinking about information about one or more other people in relation to the self (Gerber, J. P., 2018). While this process certainly takes place through interactions made in daily life events, it is specifically more applicable to persons with unique similarities. In Andris’ case, being able to speak with others that have had unique experiences (different immigration experiences) allows him to find a community that identifies with him, something that can be greatly appreciated when one feels alone in a specific situation. Through these experiences, Andris and the people like him are able to bond and learn about the lives of others in their shoes, establishing connections and friendships that can greatly improve one’s mindset and quality of life. 

Andris also mentioned during this area of the interview that the other immigrants he came into contact with expressed their issues with dealing with racism and negative comments towards them and their nationality. Andris further mentioned how he had “never been subject to half of the stuff they have” as he can “easily blend into the crowd as long as he doesn’t open his mouth”. Andris makes a good point by saying this, as it is true that immigrants often come under fire for simply looking like a minority. Many forms of immigrant related media, including propaganda and hate speech, focus on the negative aspects of immigrant’s migration to America without giving equal consideration to the benefits they bring with their culture and ideals. Many races are prohibited from immigration because of the supposed harm they can bring to society, such as Mexican or Middle Eastern denominations, but American immigration policy is one that needs a massive reform to ensure that all immigrants are treated equally. If our society rewarded media sources with viewership based on ethical and moral news instead of wrongdoing and corruption, we would see this effect lessened, but sadly this is not the case. 

The last questions asked to Andris concerns whether or not he is happy living in America. His answer was a resounding “YESSSS!!!!”, exclaiming that he loves being an American, and is proud of the fact that he recently attained American citizenship. He further explained that he is happy for the relationships, experiences, and education he has received over the years and that they are just a few of the joys he has experienced being an American. Andris goes on to say that as a younger person he had always envisioned going back to Latvia or Lithuania when he was able to, but now he is content to live in America and plans to stay forever. The change that moving to another society (especially one with the freedoms that America provides) can leave a profound impact on any person, no matter their nationality. This is one of the reasons that America is heralded as a place where dreams come true, as while it is not a perfect nation, it attempts to keep the best interests of its people in mind when it comes to laws and regulations. 

Andris’ story is a happy one, with many ups and some downs, but an overall quality of happiness and adventure. While he left his previous home with doubts and feelings of sadness, Andris has been able to make a new life for himself and has found many friends, both Americans and immigrants alike. If every immigrant’s story was like Andris’, America would be a very different place, but the sad truth is that so many immigrants are discriminated against due to their skin color, race, nationality, and untrue accusations said against them. Andris himself has seen firsthand what racism looks like, both towards him and his immigrant friends, showing us that race is not a subject to be taken lightly when discussing rights, opportunities, and admittance. Change must be brought to our immigration policy to ensure that all immigrants are given opportunities that Andris was given, no matter their nationality.

You mentioned the European run so I did a bit of googling for the sake of being fair.

Rangers have played 14 European games this season, qualifiers and group stage games. Won 5, drawn 7, lost 2. 

Nullifying the European games would take his 54 games in charge down to 40 and his 26 wins to 21.

Which makes his domestic win rate **52.5%**. Still not great, and still fewer than Pedro.

Correct me if I’m wrong but I think the other 3 managers had longer domestic cup runs as well?

And they failed to realize that, no matter how much UK matters to the EU, it also goes both ways; EU was actually lenient to the UK and it reaped plenty of benefits from the membership.

And then it comes to the referendum. It *never* should have happened, nor should the UK public been allowed to vote on this. This is too much of a vast, delicate and complex decision to be left to the public to decide, who, for better or worse, have little to no idea what it actually entails leaving the EU. Hell, the reason why there are so many people who voted Leave and are now Remainers is because they actually didn't consider how Brexit could affect their businesses (an example is a florist, who voted for Leave, but is now regretting the idea because, since the UK probably won't be part of the single market, all the imported flowers he recieves from the EU are now subject to delays in ports, affecting his business negatively).

It also doesn't help how the media falsely marketed the idea of Brexit. For instance, the ""€350 million a week"" tour bus. It's a load of bullshit. UK sends around €175 million to the EU every week, half of the money they said it was sent, and the benefits that are recieved from the EU for that money make the sum negligible. As such, that campaign was a lie. Not to mention the patriotic propaganda and the idea of controlling the borders; nobody said that, in order to do that, the market would have to be split from the EU one, potentially destabilizing the country's economy, or that it would mean putting the border between Ireland and NI again, directly breaking the Good Friday and potentially reigniting The Troubles.

In short, Brexit was fueled by anti-EU and anti-immigrant propaganda, left for misinformed people to decide, and all possible ramifications and issues that would be expected or unexpected weren't considered nearly enough, or at all.

After three years of a colossal shitshow that Brexit was, I fully support the idea for a second referendum, because, unlike the first one, people are now fully aware of the disaster this was, and many realize it's only the beginning of an even larger one.",True,False,False,,0,1554107519,,False,0,{},ejv25lt,False,t3_b7m4gl,False,True,t1_ejspn3w,/r/brexit/comments/b7m4gl/6_million/ejv25lt/,False,,1557214751,2,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,0.0,

It is astonishing how irrational remainers are prepared to be.  And to frame it as a watertight argument too.  It really goes to show what lengths you guys will go to.

This post referendum gish gallop has got to end.  

Sure.  Let's have a GE, let's vote on how to leave.  But be honest, the remainers aren't interested in that, you just want to suppress brexit.

Guys, even if you get away with it, it won't go away.  It's going to happen.

Our country is not interested enough in the EU.  35% turn out in the 2014 election, and 27% of them voted for ukip allowing them to represent us!  We don't want the Euro, we don't want them to set our taxes, we are only in it because we got to have our cake and eat it.  Don't pretend now that we love it.  

Most remainers voted remain as it was the default, psychology has well established we go for the default when faced with difficult choices (damn those experts!).  It was never because we admire the EU.

People are getting jumpy now because of fear of change.  One thing we also know is how bad we are at predictions and how we tend to see things being much worse than they are.  

Stop pretending we love the EU.  Accept that the majority want to leave.

This was a democratic decision and if you can't accept it then recognise your role in creating an unstable future for the UK.  This was not the doing of the leave voter. Democracy requires the consent of the loser and your failure to provide this is the problem.  

We have a right to decide the future of our country and a right to see our voted enacted.

Shame on you.

And god please for the love of God people stop claiming a second vote will ""resolve the issue"", it changes nothing when Leave or the Tories win again as I suspect both will - little has changed, get out of your bubbles.

Healslutting isn't bound strictly to games with Healing. The 'healslut mindset' is simply a 'submissive mindset/headspace' (or 'subspace' if your 'nasty) and can take shape in any game at all so long as you can communicate and work with a team. Maybe your game of choice doesn't have healing, but maybe they have Trading and a Carrying Capacity issue?

My wife and I picked up (...I know, I know...) Fallout 76, preorder and all. And once we learned the ropes, my beloved little healslut was made into my perfect little storageslut (since carrying capacity and storage capacity was sooooo pathetically small in the beginning!). I'd have her carry around my unnecessary equipment, send her to investigate areas, trade me legendary gear she found that would suit me and of course toy with her and punish her when she messed up, couldn't revive me, died etc. Once we learned that there was a way to heal-others (other than just reviving teammates) my 'encouragements' became more insistent as we leveled together and she specced out her healslut character to actually do some healing and be worth keeping around.

Now don't get me wrong, she has a secondary character for when we're just building stuff and having a general-gaming time, where there are no such rules or expectations put on her and we're literally just two nerds playing games together. But she does play her level 94 healslut character far more (at least when we played) then she does her 40-something 'Main' character.

Also keep in mind that the 'submissive mindset' can apply to other gaming-roles as well. DPSslut? Yup. Tankslut? That too, tons of them in Overwatch. There's also a subset of the submissive mindset we call 'brats' here. Submissives who prefer to be cheeky to their Doms and overtly encourage them to punish them by being- well, brats. Combine all the terms to create a 'label' for what kind of role you like to fill.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as for 'Sex-binded', I'm not sure if you mean 'Women are Healsluts, Men are the Doms', but the answer to that one is No. A giant solid-gold No. Men can be healsluts and women can be Doms all the same. Or they can be Switches as well.

If you mean 'Does healslutting always involve sex?' then the answer to that is No as well. Just like the BDSM culture in which this community is immersed in, BDSM sometimes (or in many cases often-times) doesn't involve sex at all. The fulfillment is from *Serving* and growing, having fun and getting enjoyment from what you're doing. But for MANY, sex is intrinsically tied to BDSM and thus healslutting. If you want there to be no sex, then there will be plenty of partners or groups out there who will welcome that. If you want there to always be sex (or at least lewd contexts/content), there's people out there for that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Healslutting is no one hard-coded thing. Just like BDSM that it comes from it is incredibly varied and nuanced. Communicate with your partners, learn about your own tastes, and find other like-minded people to play with and enjoy healslutting however you want. Just always be respectful, consenting and communicative. Safewords and all the things that go into a BDSM style environment are critical to making sure you and those you play with have an enjoyable time.",True,False,False,,0,1554112701,,False,0,{},ejv4wvy,False,t3_b7zvlh,False,True,t3_b7zvlh,/r/HealSluts/comments/b7zvlh/question_about_the_concept_of_healslutting/ejv4wvy/,False,,1557216040,3,True,False,HealSluts,t5_3fhmj,r/HealSluts,public,0.0,

I'm not sure where in Germany you'd be, but I'm enlisted at Ramstein so for what it's worth.

Everyone always hypes Germany, so much that I tried for 17 years to get here. Now that i'm here, I absolutely hate it and can't wait to move back to the States.

Germany is nice in postcards; none of those postcard photos are taken in the Kaiserslautern area, I can tell you that. It's often described among my coworkers as ""the West Virginia of Germany."" There's lots of great travel options in this area, but all of them are AT LEAST an hour's drive. IMO, this area sucks. Most of the restaurants are the same shitty ethnic places you find outside any base in the States; shitty Thai, shitty sushi, TONS of shitty Italian, etc.

Germany is nice to visit, and have a few pretzels and brats, German beers, etc. But actually living here is a real chore. Their housing, utilities, traffic/parking, and laws seem really archaic after growing up in the States. If you find a landlord who speaks English at all, you're super lucky. NOTHING is open on Sunday but some restaurants and stuff like parks &amp; museums etc, it's supposed to be your family day. As an example, you aren't allowed to mow your lawn on Sunday, because it would be a loud disturbance to your neighbors. If you don't already have what you need by Sunday, that's just poor planning on your part, or you go on base. So of course the BX and commissary are utterly slammed on Sunday, so hopefully you don't have a sick kid who needs medicine, or you forgot something for dinner...

Also you can plan on at least 3-4 weeks for them to setup your utilities like internet, unless you speak fluent German. On that note, we've experienced anti-American attitude several times; people always say that they're nicer if you make a valid attempt to speak German, but that hasn't really been our experience. IMO the genuinely nice Germans who welcome our business are really few and far between.

""Oh man, I can't wait to drive on the Autobahn!"" Yeah, except it drops to 80 km/h speed limit past many exits, long segments of every road are under construction forever, and supposedly the Germans are more respectful drivers but particularly the A6 near Ramstein has significantly more accidents and traffic jams than I ever witnessed on I-95 going into D.C. Speaking of construction, the Germans seem to start thousands of road construction projects and almost never finish them. I believe the A6 construction just finished after 10? 15 years? Most of the time you get a road blocked off with no-one actively working on it.

Then there's the Polizei. To put it shortly, we've witnessed domestic violence twice (a German man beating his wife, once in the car behind us, and once at a drunken rager next door) and reported it, they refused to even take details because they had no intention of investigating it; it's basically not their problem. 

Some other random things, Germans have no concept of personal space; they see nothing wrong with just walking up and touching your kids. They are WAY too trusting; I get miffed at the simple fact they will not deliver my mail unless my name is plastered on the door. But that's not all, if I'm not home they will give my packages to my neighbor, because of course he's trustworthy enough to make sure I get them. As someone with a security background this drives me up the wall, especially when there's enough crime in the area that targets Americans. Just last week, three brand new vehicles were stolen from my village, and vehicle break-ins in the K-town and surrounding area are fairly common according to SecFo.

With all that said, if you have money saved up, your kids are decent travelers, and you can find a pet-sitter you trust, there's not much of a better base of operations from which to travel Europe. I always say, the best thing to do in Germany is to visit Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria... etc. We do all our grocery shopping 45 minutes away in France, and the quality of produce is mind blowing compared to anywhere else I've been. German bakeries are arguably unmatched, I'll give them that.

This kind of rambled all over the place, so my apologies. It's not all bad, but my experience has been mostly bad. I didn't really touch on anything mission-related, but to say this assignment has hurt my career would be an understatement, but of course that's unit dependent.

As far as taxis go sofia has 2 generally reputble companies and they are OK supertrans and Yellow taxi. I'd choose yellow over Ok as they have nicer cars in general and they don't have knockoffs. Ok are plagued by many people driving cars with similar brand names and telephone numbers on them so beware. The number for Yellow is 0291119 and the number for OK is 029732121. You can also download the yellow app of the taxi me app. Standard rates are about 79 stotinki per kilometer during the day and 89 during the night in Sofia and go up to about 1,30 per km in some other cities. I don't think that traveling between cities by taxi is a good idea as it will cost a fortune. People are right about the trains being fishy, although they are cheap as hell. The issue with them is the people you meet there and the general hygiene of the trains. It's bad. If you ask me I'd recommend catching a bus, as they are nicer, although I can't give you any advice on finding reputable bus companies. One pro tip for taxis is to keep an eye on the meter regularly as many drivers even in legitimate companies like to ""pump up"" the price of the trip with a hidden button in their car. If you see any of that going on, don't confront them and just ask them to pull over, pay and find yourself another cab. As far as bars in sofia go I'd say go check out 65 svetulki bar, and Bar Friday. Both serve ok drinks and Bar Friday especially is usually full of foreigners. As mentioned before Raketa Rakia Bar is also an excellent place. As far as rakia goes I'd say that prune rakia is more of a serbian specialty than a bulgarian one (might get lynched for this) so if you want a properly authentic bulgarian experience go for grape. (Then again why not both?) As far as city choices go you've done good by leaving more time to Plovdiv it is a much nicer city to walk around in than Sofia, but I can give no advice on it. While you are here keep in mind that European parliamentary elections are coming up and access to alcohol on the day before the elections is severely restricted, as well as the fact that high school kids are graduating around those dates so you will probably witness their flashiness and stupidity as they ride around drunk as hell in expensive cars around the city beeping their horns as loudly as possible.

Up until 1990 many western countries did not recognise soviets as the De Jure rulers over the Baltics. Some did not even recognise De Facto rule. One of the biggest superpowers at the time - USA - also did not recognise soviets as the legitimate rulers of Baltic states. [[Source]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_continuity_of_the_Baltic_states). DPKR is probably the only country in the world that says they should legally govern Korean Peninsula. Same goes for Taiwan which says that whole China belongs to them. There is quite a bit of difference here.

&gt; What are you trying to argue? That partisans fought the Soviets in that time?

If you read the ECHR protocol, you would know by now, that Freedom Fighters defended theirselves, their culture and their country from soviet invaders. Also, you are trying to defend an officially recognised genocide. That is probably illegal in most EU countries, so were I you, I would definitely watch my tongue as you are breaking the law just by writing these comments.

&gt; I'd also be interested to know how many of these ""freedom fighters"" had ties to the Nazis

LTDF was a unit created to fight against the soviets. It consisted mostly of volunteers and the main goal of this unit was to restore independence, not to collaborate with nazies. That is the main reason it was short lived and quickly got disbanded. Also, why would nazies put LTDF leaders in concentration camps? 

Lithuania is slowly but very surely debunking the myth that Lithuanians were responsible for the Holocaust in Lithuania. Not that long ago, another National Hero - Jonas Noreika, also known as Generolas Vėtra - was freed from charges of collaboration with nazies. [Source](http://www.propatria.lt/2019/03/lggrtc-jonas-noreika-generolas-vetra-su.html?m=1) is sadly in Lithuanian, however, you should not expect this to be world wide news. You can also check wikipedia page which still states that he was a nazi collaborator.

There are many more examples like this.

Also I’d like to add, that Lithuanians never formed an SS division, despite being the largest Baltic state. Simply there were not enough conscripts that wanted to be part of nazi atrocities. Many of whom refused to join SS divisions were either put in concentration camps or went to the forests.

So to cut a long story short, you are trying to teach me my history and deny officially recognised genocide. Nice try though.

&gt;He is God!

 &gt;O ye sons and daughters of the [Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith): 

 &gt;DAY and night I have no other occupation than the remembrance of the friends, praying from the depth of my heart in their behalf, begging for them confirmation from the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith) and supplicating the direct effect of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. I am hopeful from the favors of His Highness the Lord of Bestowals, that the friends of God during such a time may become the secret cause of the illumination of the hearts of humanity, breathing the breath of life upon the spirits—whose praiseworthy results may become conducive to the glory and exaltation of humankind throughout all eternity. Although in some of the **Western States, like California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, the fragrances of holiness are diffused, numerous souls have taken a share and a portion from the fountain of everlasting life, they have obtained heavenly benediction, have drunk an overflowing cup from the wine of the love of God and have hearkened to the melody of the Supreme Concourse—yet in the states of New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada, the lamp of the love of God is not ignited in a befitting and behooving manner, and the call of the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith) has not been raised.** Now, if it is possible, show ye an effort in this direction. Either travel yourselves, personally, throughout those states or choose others and send them, so that they may teach the souls. For the present those states are like unto dead bodies: they must breathe into them the breath of life and bestow upon them a heavenly spirit. Like unto the stars they must shine in that horizon and thus the rays of the Sun of Reality may also illumine those states. 


&gt;God says in the great Qur’án: “Verily God is the helper of those who have believed. He will lead them from darkness into light.” 1 This means: God loves the believers, consequently He will deliver them from darkness and bring them into the world of light. 

&gt;It is also recorded in the blessed Gospel: Travel ye throughout the world and call ye the people to the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God#Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith). 2 Now this is the time that you may arise and perform this most great service and become the cause of the guidance of innumerable souls. Thus through this superhuman service the rays of peace and conciliation may illumine and enlighten all the regions and the world of humanity may find peace and composure. 


 &gt;During my stay in America I cried out in every meeting and summoned the people to the propagation of the ideals of universal peace. I said plainly that the continent of Europe had become like unto an arsenal and its conflagration was dependent upon one spark, and that in the coming years, or within two years, all that which is recorded in the Revelation of John and the Book of Daniel would become fulfilled and come to pass. This matter, in all probability, was published in the [San Francisco Bulletin, October 12, 1912](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/75w2n9/october_12_on_this_date_in_1912_an_article_in_the/). You may refer to it, so that the truth may become clear and manifest; thus ye may fully realize that this is the time for the diffusion of the fragrances. 


 &gt;The magnanimity of man must be heavenly or, in other words, it must be assisted by the divine confirmation, so that he may become the cause of the illumination of the world of humanity. 


 &gt;Upon you be greeting and praise!

And suddenly, they come across an AF, who is probably more petite, has been so heavily brainwashed to believe any WM paying attention to her is like a gift from heaven (so the chances of the WM fearing he'll be turned down are almost none), and who could very well be not as strongly opinionated as we are the West.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to AF about this 'AF are more subservient' stereotype, and they actually did agree that they could be more into cooking and household etc than Western women. However, they also insist that AM are even more expecting/demanding this kind of subservient behavior compared to WM, who, according to them are much more positive towards feminism. idk, all this seems truly strange to me, because I can't believe that we're still having such discussions, about women and household etc, in the 21st century and with all this globalization.

&amp;#x200B;

But, again, I truly hope we'll see these stats e.g. in 2020, because I BET, things will start changing so much for AM. And you really do have BTS to thank for that.

ETA: If you don't believe me about WMAF consisting mainly of extremely insecure men just look at how many WM celebrities date/marry AF. Not many, no? Compare that to the number of WM celebrities who are into e.g. Latinas or BM celebrities who are into WF. That's quite an indication, imo.

You said no cheddar was orange or yellowish orange. You called it fake American cheese. Aged cheddar is yellowish orange. The longer it ages the more the color darkens. It is not white/pale cream as you describe it. It starts that way, and as it ages changes colors. There is a scientific explanation behind this which you can find here:  https://www.thekitchn.com/all-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-cheese-colors-explained-the-cheesemonger-166329a
But the relevant part I will put in front of you ""cheese that’s left to age will deepen in color, so a cheese that’s ripened for 9 months will be significantly more intense color-wise than a fresh cheese."" 

You said you bought cheese at a gas station, I asked for evidence because in the previous sentence I provided evidence for my claim. That's how an argument works. I'm not sure what you are used to but this is how normal conversations are had. 

To your other point (which to be fair I am being generous in calling it a point), the world wars thing was a joke. Just like the gas station thing, just like the kids getting shot thing. You clearly have a hard time recognising humor. And if you would like I will provide an epistemological breakdown of where the humor in my statements comes from. Of course by doing this, it will remove the humor from those statements. That's how jokes work, when you have to explain them they stop being funny. For example: I made a joke comparing the banning memes to lack of any sort of banning of guns in America. Its funny because Europe banned something to solve a problem that doesn't exist, while America won't ban anything even though the problem is an all to common tragedy. Its called self deprecating humor. I'm making fun of america. 
 The brother thing I understand because I took it for granted that you knew who hulk hogan was. Cultural differences and what not.

I am in no means an expert on cheese or comedy, but what my interaction has led me to believe is that I am more knowledgable about it than you. This will be the end of my serious posts, from here on out they will be stuffed with cheese puns (see what I did there? I'm trying to make it easy for you to spot the joke) and other jokes probably about Europe.

A good starting point for a barbell would be to consider Rogue's EU Oly Bar, or the Pyrros bar.

If you do see used bars in your market on places like facebook and craigslist, look for anything Rogue, Eleiko, Werksan, Uesaka.

You haven't given a whole lot to start on as far as what brands of barbell you were looking at for $200.

However, I don’t think respect should be institutionalized. Hate speech laws in many european countries is categorized as “any speech that offends the receiver”. That is a very slippery slope, and this could very easily politicized. When something can be taken advantage of, it will be. When it comes to shutting down opposition, “hate speech”, simply accusing them of being racist or sexist can do the job. I don’t worry about “finally being called out for my inherent bigotry”, but the fact that as sensible as I may speak, it may still offend someone, or god forbid a marginalized group: something being offensive or not is entirely defined by them after all. And for those who actually hate someone by their skin colour or gender, here is something about free society: even a Nazi is entitled to his/her opinion. As long as they don’t violate the rights of others.

Freedom of expression is one of the things HK holds dear, and is consistently undermined by the regressive left in the west. Chick fil-a isn’t allowed to open a branch in the airport of Buffalo NY because its CEO opposes same-sex marriage. If HK starts passing legislation regarding “hate” speech as defined by the government, it may just be the perfect chance for the PRC to step in. 

Of course, racial discrimination is a thing of its own in Asia, and is an issue which should be addressed. However, I would argue the general attitude of the population matters more than some institutionalized rule, law or not, which prohibits certain speech. This would just raise tension. Education could be a better starting point, nationalism in Asia would be compared to Nazi era standards in some places.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst your idea is admirable I would argue the fact that each turns represent 3 months is more than enough time to take into account orders being created in the UK, them being dispatched by rider, the six week journey to the colonies and being delivered to their General. You could maybe make a plan and implement it the turn after to simulate it but I feel it's already in the game and implementing plans does usually tend to happen (for me personally) the turn after they are thought up.

My own personal rule is to never own land on mainland Europe as GB, unless its of strategic importance to the balance of power. For example I had whittled down the French to holding only France and Corsica, I took Corsica and gave it to the 13 colonies (as a base to start expansion/trade in Europe), I then took Paris and immediately gave it to the Dutch. This meant that my main ally was dominant and occupied in Europe so I could conquered the rest of the world without having to worry about pissing of the Dutch. I did however later in the campaign get given Hannover as part of a peace deal with denmark (I only naval blockade them), and seeing as though Prussia was the main rival to the Dutch and they were both pretty powerful I kept the province and parked an army full of elite units in there so I can better manage and have direct input on the building tensions in Europe.

""Latino"" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word latinoamericano (Latin American in English) or the Portuguesephrase latino americano, thus excluding speakers of Spanish or Portuguese from Europe.[6] Both Hispanic and Latino are generally used to denote people living in the United States,[7][8] so much so that ""Outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Colombians, Peruvians, and so forth.""[9][10] In Latin America, the term latino is not a common endonym and its usage in Spanish as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States.
The U.S. government's Office of Management and Budget has defined Hispanic or Latinopeople as being those who ""trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central, and South America(other than Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname), and other Spanish cultures"".[11]The United States Census uses the ethnonymHispanic or Latino to refer to ""a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race"".[12] The Census Bureau also explains that ""[o]rigin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.""[13] Hence the U.S. Census and the OMB are using the terms differently. The U.S. Census and the OMB use the terms interchangeably, where both terms are synonyms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the term Hispanic or Latino.[14]
The AP Stylebook's recommended usage of Latino in Latin America includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons ""from – or whose ancestors were from – ... Latin America, including Brazilians"". However, in the recent past, the term Latinos was also applied to people from the Caribbean region,[15] but those from former Dutch and British colonies are excluded.[16]

[Ali-Kuli Khan](http://bahaistories.blogspot.com/2010/11/ali-kuli-khan-becomes-one-of-abdul.html) (also known as Nabílu'd-Dawlih) was an eminent Iranian Baha'i who served briefly as 'Abdu'l-Baha’s English-language secretary between 1899 and 1901, he was subsequently sent to America where he was the first to translate into English some of the most important works of Baha’u’llah, such as the *[Kitab-i-Iqan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-%C3%8Dq%C3%A1n)*, *[The Seven Valleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Valleys)* and *[the Glad-Tidings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablets_of_Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99u%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h_Revealed_After_the_Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas)*. He also continued to translate 'Abdu'l-Baha’s correspondence with the American Baha'is. Ali Kuli Khan was appointed Iranian *chargés d'affaires* in Washington in 1910 and later served in various high-ranking diplomatic positions. He married Boston socialite Florence Breed and was the father of [Marzieh Gail](https://bahaikipedia.org/Marzieh_Gail).




From the [Encyclopaedia Iranica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Iranica) article titled [Gail, Marzieh](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gail-marzieh)...

GAIL, MARZIEH (b. near Boston, Mass., 1 April 1908; d. San Francisco, 16 October 1993;  Figure 1), Persian-American Bahaʾi author, essayist, and translator.  She was the second child of ʿAliqoli (Ali-Kuli) Khan Nabil-al-Dawla, the Iranian consul in Washington, and Florence Breed of Boston; their marriage was the first Persian-American marital union in the Bahaʾi community.  ʿAliqoli Khan was from Kashan; his father met the Bab in 1845 and became a Babi and later a Bahaʾi (Gail, 1987, p. 6).  Florence Breed became a Bahaʾi through her husband.  In 1912, at the age of four, Marzieh met ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, then head of the Bahaʾi Faith, during his journey to the West.  He is said to have remarked that the child had āteš (fire) and  namak (salt; Gail, 1991, p. 87).   She grew up “half Eastern and half Western, neither this nor that and yet both” (Gail, 1991, p. 273).

Marzieh’s education was conducted by a series of private tutors, since her father's diplomatic work meant that the family had to move frequently, living in Washington, D.C., Paris, Tehran, Istanbul, and Tbilisi.  While living in Iran as a child, she observed at close range court life in the waning years of the Qajar era, although she avoided events where she would have to go veiled, which she disliked.   Her family were often guests at the opulent royal residences including the Kāḵ-e Ṣāḥebqarāniya, where, as a child, she once had a comic debate with the young Aḥmad Shah (r. 1909-24; Gail, 1991, p.136). When she was fifteen, her parents received a marriage proposal for her from the shah himself.  Her parents declined, because they were determined to see their daughter educated.  She later wrote that they thus saved her from “that quicksand” (Gail, 1991, p. 246).  Her father, who had been appointed minister of the court of Crown Prince Moḥammad-Ḥasan Mirzā (Gail, 1991, pp. 254-55), frequently received death threats; the family was denounced by the clerics from the pulpit of the mosques for being “Babis” and because the daughters were known to appear in public unveiled.  The family felt, however, that the attacks were instigated by foreign sources seeking to block his efforts at economic development and fiscal reform (Gail, 1991, p. 254).

In 1924 the family returned to the United States.  Marzieh began her studies at Vassar College and graduated from Stanford University in 1929.  Shortly afterwards, she married Howard Carpenter, a medical student at the same university.  In 1932, she received a master’s degree in English from the University of California at Berkeley.

Marzieh had first met Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (Šawqi Effendi Rabbāni) in France in 1920, just before he became head of the Bahaʾi Faith.  She was devoted to him, writing that the moments she spent in his presence were “the only really important times of [her] life except for the moments with ʿAbdu’l-Bahá” (Gail, 1991, p. 301).  For his part, Shoghi Effendi greatly valued and constantly encouraged her.  In 1933, at Shoghi Effendi’s request, Marzieh and Howard went to live in Iran, and Marzieh was hired as the first female reporter to serve on the staff of a Tehran newspaper (Chen, p. 137); but when Howard contracted poliomyelitis and became paralyzed, they returned to the United States, where he died.  In 1939, she married Harold Gail, a manufacturer of springs, and in 1954 the two went to live in Europe as Bahaʾi pioneers, helping to establish Bahaʾi religion first in France and later in Austria and the Netherlands. 

Marzieh Gail’s literary career began with essays she wrote for the Bahaʾi magazine Star of the West when she was a student at Stanford University.  In 1951 she published Persia and the Victorians, followed by several works on Bahaʾi subjects and three books (including one for young readers) about fourteenth-century Europe.  She also published newspaper articles under the pen name V. Ives.  She was known for her irrepressible sense of humor, which permeated her writing.  A reviewer of The Three Popes found it “disconcerting” that she treated “the record of human experience as something of a comic opera provided for the delectation of posterity” (Kirkus Reviews, p. 543).

While in Iran in the 1930s, she began to translate Bahaʾi scriptures into English. Shoghi Effendi commissioned her to translate the “Questions and Answers” appendix to Bahāʾ-Allāh’s Ketāb-e aqdas and then the text of the book itself, which she worked on in collaboration with Bahaʾi scholar Mirzā Asad-Allāh Fāżel Māzandarāni.  Later she published a translation of Bahāʾ-Allāh’s Haft wādi and Čahār wādi, followed by translations of ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ’s treatise on modernization and reform, Resāla-ye madaniya, and his Taḏkerat al-wafāʾ.  She contributed translations to the volume Selections from the Writings of ʿAbdu’l-Bahá and also translated the memoir Zendagi-e Ostād Moḥammad-ʿAli Salmāni.

Marzieh Gail and her husband returned to the United States in 1964 and lived in Keene, New Hampshire.  Her later years were devoted to writing a series of biographical and autobiographical works.  Her husband did the household chores so she would be free to write (Chen, p. 138).  In 1981 they moved to San Francisco, where she died in 1993.

Buckle up, Here we go 1.) I would suggest you take a look at “How rich am I”  https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/  This website was made from a Labour Party left wing UK think tank, using global poverty statistics to show you every single person in the United States actually is in the top 3% of the world, rather we are not alone in this 3% but many of our EU friends are with us in the 3%, nevertheless by global standards everyone is elitist here. 50% of the world doesn’t eat every day, and 33% live off of the equivalent of $15 a day or less. Our poor enjoy toilets, running water, individual car ownership.  This suggest even our poorest are still world elite status as you would like to put it. I’m honestly puzzled why you mentioned “global income inequality” as if the United States isn’t doing enough to combat “global income equality” by outsourcing millions of manufacturing jobs to China and India, bolstering their middle class. I have a friend in India, whom makes a decent living making H&amp;M clothing. 


The fact of the matter is that we have the largest economy in the world for our poor, an economy where products and services compete with each other for the cheapest products. Many things from squatters rights, entitlements and abundance of food shelters enables even our poorest to enjoy a standard of living above those in poverty in Brazil, demonstrated by world poverty statistics.



Next point 2.) I never made an argument for “Trickle down economics” I don’t advocate tax breaks for the rich. I would re-read my statement. I simply said the United States has the biggest income mobility in the world, the fact of the matter is that nobody is OCCUPYING the top 5% of America or the top 10% but rather it is constantly fluctuating, for instance I made $60,000 two years ago, putting me in the top 30%.....this year I had medical issues and I’ll only be bringing in around $40,000, and I’ll be in the 50% ... My father wrote a book and published it, making $200,000 a few years back, putting him in the top 1%. Growing up we lived an average life. We fluctuated all over the place. I simply suggested that as people move up in the income brackets, they absolutely create the products and services we enjoy; Jeff Bezoz from Amazon just created another plant in Austin Texas starting at $15/hour.  


3.) For your knowledge, I actually support a higher tax on higher earnings, but that doesn’t negate my view of income equality being a college professor pseudo talking point for a socialist utopia that doesn’t exist. People getting richer from our economy, does not inherently make people poorer ; My father writing his book and joining the 1% for example.  Africa, no matter what semantics you might employ, has tremendous income equality no matter how you slice it, income equality alone doesn’t mean anything.

Also because of investment there will always be those getting much richer, the principle of investment demands that money accrue interest over time, I would suggest we focus more on lifting people out of poverty and less fixating on the success of others.

Até então, não sabia de quem havia apanhado, mas descobriria rapidamente. Quando Ustra o deixou, Diogo perguntou a outro guarda que estava por perto. “Onde é que eu tô?” “Aqui é a antessala do inferno”, avisou o agente, de modo sarcástico, antes de mandá-lo sentar numa *cadeira de dragão*. Nu, colocaram eletrodos nas suas genitálias, boca, ouvidos, e com choques elétricos ordenavam suas confissões para entregar companheiros.

 Depois das torturas diárias que o aguardavam durante os meses que ficou na prisão, Diogo viria a concluir que Ustra era o líder demoníaco daquele inferno. O comandante, homenageado neste domingo por [Jair Bolsonaro para dar o “sim” ao impeachment da presidenta Dilma](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/04/19/politica/1461019293_721277.html), foi chefe de um centro de sequestro, tortura e morte na ditadura militar (1964-1985), conhecido oficialmente por DOI-CODI, que funcionou no bairro da Vila Mariana, em São Paulo.

 Apelidado de *Casa da Vovó* entre seus comandados, o Destacamento de Operações de Informações e Centro de Operações de Defesas Internas tinha em [Ustra](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/carlos_alberto_brilhante_ustra/a/) o cérebro da repressão quando a Governo militar resolveu endurecer com integrantes dos movimentos que resistiam à ditadura nos anos 70. Em geral, jovens universitários que acreditavam na utopia de poder combater um Estado militar para restabelecer a democracia, usurpada em 1964 pelo golpe. Diogo era um deles. Integrava a Ação Libertadora Nacional, de inspiração socialista, o que no meio de uma Guerra Fria, significava ser classificado como terrorista.

 A sigla DOI-CODI, assim como o sobrenome Ustra, têm um efeito cáustico nos ouvidos das vítimas da sua tortura e das famílias que perderam de maneira cruel seus pais, mães, filhos ou simplesmente amigos. Pelo menos 50 pessoas morreram enquanto Ustra comandou o DOI (1970-1973), e há registro de mais de 300 pessoas torturadas sob suas ordens.

 Quem saiu vivo, ou foi mutilado ou saiu com uma cicatriz eterna pela sádica violência aplicada sob comando de Ustra. Diogo, hoje geólogo, e presidente da [Comissão da Verdade, em São Paulo](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2014/12/10/politica/1418237519_479087.html), foi um dos poucos a ser torturado diretamente por Ustra, que na maior parte do tempo, se dedicava à inteligência dos processos de tortura. Dava ordens, mapeava os movimentos de militantes, estabelecia as táticas para que sua equipe pudesse capturá-los e chegar aos líderes. “A especialidade deles era violentar e torturar mulheres”, lembra Diogo, que presenciou inúmeras violações enquanto esteve ali, inclusive a tortura de sua mulher à época. Grávida e nua, passou por choques elétricos na sua frente. O bebê que carregava não resistiu. Arlete sofreu hemorragias e não pôde recorrer a apoio médico.

 ### **Crianças na sala de tortura**

 Amélia Teles, ou Amelinha, também caiu nas garras de Ustra. Foi presa junto com o marido Cesar, e o amigo Carlos Danielli. Viveram todo o roteiro do inferno no DOI CODI, conforme conta [num vídeo disponível no Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFqm0OcJDDk). Militantes do PCdoB, sentiram bem mais que surras e choques elétricos. O casal de jovens de pouco mais de 20 anos, foi preso em dezembro de 1972, e apanhou seguidamente sem ter noção do tempo. Certo dia, Amelinha estava nua, sentada na cadeira de dragão, urinada e vomitada, quando viu entrar na sala de tortura seus dois filhos, Janaína de 5 anos, e Edson, 4. Ustra havia mandado buscar as duas crianças porque queria que eles testemunhassem de seus pais. “Mamãe, por que você está azul e a papai verde?”, perguntou sua filha, enquanto queria abraçar a mãe, paralisada de dor e pelos fios elétricos. A cor era fruto das torturas que desfiguraram sua tez.

 As duas crianças foram levadas para a casa de um militar enquanto os pais continuaram apanhando nas mãos de agentes da ditadura comandados por Ustra. Os arquivos da ditadura mostram crianças de colo fichadas como filhos de terroristas. “Vamos matar seus filhos, menos comunistas vivos”, ouviam seus pais enquanto eram torturados. Amelinha foi espancada por Ustra enquanto ouvia: “sua terrorista!”. Viu a morte do amigo Carlos enquanto estava presa. Seu marido Cesar faleceu no ano passado.

 ### Mortos

 Diogo e a família Teles conseguiram sobreviver àqueles anos para contar os horrores que aconteciam durante a ditadura brasileira. Mas muitos não tiveram essa sorte. O jornalista Vladimir Herzog, que em 1975 era diretor da TV Cultura, foi assassinado no interior do prédio do DOI-CODI, depois de ter sido intimado a prestar depoimentos por supostas ligações com o Partido Comunista. No Instituto Vladimir Herzog é possível ler o que se passou no final de outubro de 1975, depois que Vlado, como era conhecido, se apresentou para depor. Encapuzado, foi sufocado com amoníaco e submetido a seguidas sessões de tortura.

 “Naquela cela solitária, com o ouvido na janelinha, eu podia ouvir os gritos: ‘Quem são os jornalistas? Quem são os jornalistas?’ Pelo tipo de grito, pelo tipo de porrada, sabia que estava sendo feito com alguém exatamente aquilo pelo que eu tinha passado"", recordaria anos depois o jornalista Sérgio Gomes, que estava preso no mesmo local em que Vlado se encontrava. “Lá pela hora do almoço há uma azáfama, uma correria. Ele foi torturado durante toda a manhã e se dá o tal silêncio. A pessoa para de ser torturada e em seguida há uma azáfama, uma correria… A gente percebe que tem alguma coisa estranha acontecendo. Tinham acabado de matar o Vlado.”

 No livro *A Casa da Vovó*, o jornalista Marcelo Godoy faz um minucioso relato sobre o DOI-CODI a partir de relatos de ex-agentes que trabalharam com Ustra. Levou dez anos para concluir a obra (2004 a 2014), e viu o antigo comandante tentar interferir em sua apuração em alguns momentos. O velho torturador ligou para seus ex-subalternos pedindo silêncio. Muitos, no entanto, contrariaram a ordem do antigo chefe. Um deles relatou a Godoy: “Você não tem ideia do que é passar uma noite inteira vendo um homem e sabendo que no dia seguinte ele vai morrer... Todos nós carregamos um fantasma que te acompanha a vida inteira. Esse é o meu.”

 Ustra contava com o apoio silencioso dos presidentes militares que mantinham um discurso de que torturas eram casos pontuais. Em 2008, a Justiça o reconheceu como torturador e, em 2012, condená-lo em primeira instância pela morte de apenas uma vítima, Luiz Eduardo da Rocha Merlino, morto em 19 de julho de 1971. “Nunca cometi torturas”, disse ele em depoimento à Comissão Nacional da Verdade em 2013. No ano seguinte, foi declarado um dos [377 agentes da repressão](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2014/12/10/politica/1418212909_598291.html) pela Comissão. Ustra morreu em julho de 2015 de câncer.

Initially I didn't. Till I read that Merkel forbade the EU from coming to terms with the UK on side issues like migrants rights because she thought that waiting till we were in recession would be better:

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-theresa-may-pre-brexit-expats-plan-nixed-by-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-negotiations-european-union-residence/

&gt;The Germans argue it makes more sense for the EU to keep the trade-off on British expatriates' rights up its sleeve as a sweetener during the most painful phase of the negotiations, likely to occur in 2018. It was naïve for the British to expect the issue could be taken out of the overall context. **By then, Britain could be gripped by a Brexit-induced slowdown, with foreign financial firms moving jobs from the City to the eurozone and inflation due to the pound's slide eating into living standards.**

It didn't work out that way. The UK continued to grow, movement from the City turned out to be negligible and it's Germany that is in trouble.

I'm hoping that Germany suffers a really really severe recession - that should teach them a nice sharp lesson about playing games. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

You can say that the black population was systematically disadvantaged/held back and the white population was just getting normal treatment (free school, healthcare, good policing etc.), or that the black population that was 90% of people in the country was being treated in the standard way that the government treated people South African and the whites were living a life of privilege where they got *outlandish luxuries* like free schooling and free healthcare and good policing.

What if they want to kill you so no witnesses?  
  
What if you walk down the stairs with a rifle in hand, there are 4 guys and you run out of 10 rounds?  
  

&gt;
&gt;You did inadvertently make a great argument for the law in the case of mass shootings, hard changing mags if there are dozens of people around you that can attack you.
  
Ah, another grabber shows up under a gun post... good job INTENTIONALLY MISREADING MY COMMENT AND PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH.  The point is, you are at home without equipment at night maybe, no reason to have gear on so you can only grab one mag that is in the gun already and either or extra mag or a flashlight or something else... you NEED more than 10 rounds just in case.  
  
Mass shooters will just wear vests with magazines in them so get the fuck out with this stupid reasoning. People don't sleep with fucking web gear on, so don't ban their magazines because you are a 350iq grabber who thinks ammo works like in video games.  
  

&gt;I understand it's a firearms sub and you probably hate all firearms laws but that is a ridiculous position to have.  
  
Actually i support proper regulations in countries where it is necessary, like EU where we have people living extremely close. And even in a lot of countries in Europe it is way too hard to get guns. I had to learn the stupid process to pass my classes in Hungary so i DO know.  
 But then comes the fact that people like you don't know how guns work so you want to pass laws that can be extended to ban more and more parts thus banning guns indirectly.  
  
&gt; Some regulation of anything is beneficial for all parties involved.  
  
OKAY... Here is what being beneficial to both sides would be: reopening the MG registry with NFA process, legalizing suppressors as part of hearing protection and stopping all attempts at magazine, ammo or cosmetic feature bans.  
  
Banning ammo is just banning guns using it but saving face publicly. Banning magazines has no reason and accomplishes nothing. Banning features just hurts gun owners.  
  
I make gun parts... do you know how ridiculously easy it is to illegally make a pistol grip for a ""compliant"" gun? Do you know how easy it is to make a full auto submachinegun? 
  
&gt;If you blindly oppose all regulation you aren't rational you're a fanatic. 
  
Good thing i am not one. My parents are one of the most accepting people in the world and they grew up under communosm. I know it very well from them and public education how tyranny works. Lies, technically true statements, misinterpretable and intentionally badly worded laws and praying on emotion were their tools. And since i have professional education regarding guns, i see all the true intentions behind all the useless laws. But hey, you know how they say... ""they came for them but i was not that, so i was left alone. Eventually they came for us and we were alone""  
  
Just because you dislike guns you should not advocate for meaningless feelgood laws.  
  
&gt;Power shouldn't be given to people who can't be responsible in its usage.  
  
The problem arises when an agency arbitrarily declare you unfit for it for having the wrong thoughts or making stupid facebook posts years ago.  
  
&gt; Common sense background checks were actually supported by the NRA and Republicans in the past and would help separate power from the irresponsible without needing to infringe on law-abiding citizens like this law.
  
***In the US you need a background check to buy guns from a store already.***
-  
  

&gt;This specific law does seem unnecessary but at least one state is trying it so we will have data to show if it's a good idea or not. Then we will know for sure if it is worth trying.  
  
Heh... Chicago has very high gun control and gun crime... strange.  
  
Australia had a declining crime rate and their gun laws had no visible effect on it. It kept lowering the same rate yearly as before the gun laws.  
  
Hungary had criminals mass killing people at a bank with machineguns... machineguns were banned... Bataclan and Charlie Hebdo were both done with unlawfully acquired illegal machineguns...  
   

&gt;We can argue hypotheticals all day but we will have to wait for the data to know for sure.
 
I just put up some examples... oh and the mass truck attacks a couple years back! Nobody had a gun to stop them..  
  
Oh oh oh! The Christchurch massacre where the second mosque was defended by a guy with a gun!  
  
Head over to r/dgu and see for yourself.  
  
You brought up some decent point so i hope my initial reaction was not too much. Your comment overall seems more intelligent than the general grabber propaganda shilling that is usually on the same level as antivaccination people or flat earthers.

[],DragonHeretic,1432675441.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqcmm,False,"In terms of what polities had these names, and at what times in history, here's a little bit of context for the origins of the terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Emperor, Duke, and Count are all terms that emerge out of the Roman Empire, and come from titles that formerly would have applied to functionaries in the roman empire. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Emperor - Imperator - was of course the ruler of the Roman Empire, but just who is an Emperor, and what is an Empire has varied throughout history. While we would apply the term ""Empire"" retroactively to expansive realms that existed before the Roman Empire, and onto realms in other Non-Roman Cultures. Ultimately, the Roman Emperor was an at least nominally elected military autocrat, and while the position was often hereditary, it was only so if one of the Emperor's sons was a fit leader.

&amp;#x200B;

The other main Emperor to appear in the Middle Ages, and help to define what it meant to be an Emperor, was the Holy Roman Emperor, and similar to his Regular Roman Counterpart, the Holy Roman Emperor was elected, but by a group of Elector Princes, and confirmed by the Pope. What both Emperors - the Basileus and the Kaiser (and eventually, the Tsar) had in common was their claims to Roman Heritage. Historians have liberally applied it outside of its European, and Roman context, but I think if we're strict, those are really the only two people who it's proper to consider Emperors, which is by no means to downplay the power of other people who get called Emperors.

&amp;#x200B;

Dukes and Counts are similarly concepts of Roman Descent, and come from the Dux, and the Comes respectively. Dux was an informal title referring to a military leader of any kind in the Roman Empire, and in later years, would become official, a sort of counterpart to a regional governor - the highest military leader in the government. In Western Europe, which we are principally talking about when we use the word Duke, this distinction collapsed among the Lombards, Franks, and others who took over after the collapse of the Roman Government, but still kept many of their traditions, and Duces, or Dukes, were often regional governors, and the realm's highest officials - they could be chosen as the King, or Emperor's generals in times of war. The Counts get their name from the Comites, the Companions of the Emperor, and are Lords subordinate to another Lord, getting their authority from him.

&amp;#x200B;

King is the only title that doesn't have a Latin Etymology, but it still comes into play in Western thought in the wake of the fall of the Western Roman Emperor. Once you had the fall of Rome, many different Germanic and Gothic nations inherited the realms once ruled by Rome, and their loyalties tended to fall along cultural lines. While it was not by any means universal, it was certainly common to have one King of Franks, or Germans, or Goths, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So what actually decides who is a Count, a Duke, a King, or an Emperor? It ultimately just comes down to about three things. If you were a subordinate Lord, what honor did your liege grant you? Or what could you get away with styling yourself as, whether you were dependent or independent? And finally, what do historians decide you were? Many people outside of Post Roman Western Europe are still styled as Kings or Emperors, for example, even those conceptions are really specifically Post Roman Western European Ideas. Count and Duke are almost never applied outside of the context of Western Europe, and it's often more accurate to talk about Lordly People from other cultures as Princes, or really, whatever is the culturally equivalent title.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, outside of a Western European, Post-Roman context, terms like Count or Duke don't have much meaning, and are rarely ever used. Kings and Emperors, while terms that are used more broadly, are still terms that apply in a primarily Post-Roman context. A lot of who was a King vs. who was an Archduke ultimately just came down to politics of the secular rulers against the Pope, and one of the only Arch-duchies was created specifically to give the Habsburgs (who created it) leverage against the Prince-Electors.

&amp;#x200B;

After previous waves of immigration, there was a cooling-off period during which borders were tightened and assimilation occurred. The most recent/present wave of immigration has been more rapid and large in absolute numbers than previous ones, and there seems to be no desire on the Dem side to enter a cooling-off period, or to even acknowledge that the current situation (large numbers of unassimilated folks) is not healthy for the society. This refusal to acknowledge or act on the issue leads Republicans to fearmonger that current immigration rates will continue forever, as there is, truly, no end in sight at present. 

We're also witnessing the worst-case scenario for our future over in Europe right now. Their multicultural experiment has been a disaster (even Merkel conceded) (see Pakistani rape gangs, terrorist attacks, increased anti-semitism &amp; homophobia, ghettos &amp; no-go zones, etc.) So the GOP looks at that as the Dems agenda for America.

Talvez ela não imagine o quanto o feminismo contribuiu para que ela, sendo mulher, pudesse usar shorts e protestar em via pública. O alvo do ódio de Isabella – que diz ser advogada mas não tem OAB – eram mulheres militantes da Democracia Corintiana, que tinham participado do ato contra o [golpe de 64](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/dictadura_brasilena) pouco antes no Vão do Masp, na mesma avenida.

          Alexandre José, manifestante pró-ditadura, estava na frente da delegacia e acabou sendo identificado pela polícia por causa desta imagem Daniel Arroyo Ponte Jornalismo   

   Isabella estava com um grupo de ativistas do Despertar Patriótico/Direita Unida, a favor da ditadura militar, e que tinha preparado um bolo para comemorar os 55 anos do início do regime que torturou e matou centenas de pessoas. No ano passado, ela foi candidata a deputada estadual pelo PRTB, mas recebeu apenas 512 votos. Isabella exibe nos braços duas tatuagens: a frase “Brasil acima de tudo” e “Brasil, ame-o ou deixe-o”, lema do regime militar, junto a uma caveira com um cap do Brasil. Com camisetas e bandeiras exaltando 1964, o Exército Brasileiro e o presidente [Jair Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro), os ativistas entraram em confronto com um grupo que vestia preto, usava adesivos “Fora, Bolsonaro” e seguia para o Parque do Ibirapuera para a Caminhada do Silêncio, em memória das vítimas da ditadura e em repúdio ao golpe militar.

 A reportagem da **Ponte**, que havia acompanhado o ato simbólico de queima do boneco do torturador confesso [coronel Brilhante Ustra](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/04/20/politica/1461180363_636737.html), em frente ao Masp, também seguia para a segunda manifestação contrária ao golpe, quando, na frente da estação Trianon-Masp da linha 3-verde do Metrô, ativistas ligados a diversos movimentos antifascistas tiraram as bexigas coladas no vidro da estação com a data: 31/3/1964. Duas mulheres, entre elas Isabella, reagiram iniciando as agressões, que foram respondidas imediatamente pelo grupo oposto. Não havia nem PM (Polícia Militar) nem GCM (Guarda Civil Metropolitana) no momento. A pancadaria rapidamente ficou generalizada. Com paus de bandeira, socos, chutes, pontapés, os grupos entraram em confronto direto. A reportagem foi atingida por gás do spray de gengibre de Isabella, que descarregava a lata indiscriminadamente no meio das pessoas.

 O fotógrafo Daniel Arroyo registrou uma sequência de golpes entre os ativistas.

            Ponte Daniel Arroyo   

   Os ativistas pró-ditadura usavam paus de bandeira para agredir os manifestantes contrários ao golpe, que não estavam armados. Uma das fotos publicadas nas redes sociais da **Ponte** permitiu que a polícia identificasse um agressor, o vigilante Alexandre José Pereira Neves – que aparece na primeira imagem da reportagem com uma barra na mão -, o colocasse no B.O. como uma das partes da ocorrência para posterior investigação. Ele vestia uma camiseta do Enéas, usava calça de estampa de camuflagem e coturnos e aparece nesta imagem agredindo um integrante da Democracia Corintiana. Ele estava misturado aos militantes pró-ditadura em frente ao DP onde a ocorrência foi registrada na noite deste domingo.

 Uma das vítimas, Marcus Santana, estava passando pelo local e ao ver o quebra-quebra, decidiu tentar ajudar a separar. Levou a pior. “Eu estava com o intuito de ajudar a acabar com aquilo. As pessoas estavam se agredindo, um absurdo, fugiu do controle totalmente. Quando eu me aproximei de um cara gordinho de camiseta cinza para perguntar o que estava acontecendo, ele levantou alguma coisa que segurava nas mãos, até agora não sei o que é, e me atacou. Tive o reflexo rápido de me defender com o braço, poderia ser pior”, contou Marcus que vestia uma camiseta contra o fascismo. “Penso que há ideias boas na direita e na esquerda. Mas [extremismo, fascismo](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/fascismo), não dá”. Marcus teve ferimentos na cabeça, no braço esquerdo e perto do tornozelo. Ele fez questão de comparecer ao 78º Distrito Policial onde a ocorrência foi registrada para depor e contar a versão dele dos fatos.

   Também esteve na delegacia o agricultor Guilherme Flach, que estava passeando na Avenida Paulista, quando também encontrou a briga e se aproximou por curiosidade. Como estava próximo do grupo antifascista, passou ser alvo de xingamentos e começou a fazer uma transmissão ao vivo do seu celular pelo Instagram. Neste momento, Isabella o ameaçou com uma taser. “Ela me deu um tapa e começou a gritar que eu tinha batido nela, que eu era agressor. Eu disse que não, ela jogou spray na minha cara. Eu vim aqui na delegacia porque quero fazer um boletim de ocorrência contra ela por calúnia e uso de arma de uso restrito”, afirmou Guilherme.

 Leandro Mohallem, bolsonarista do Juntos Pelo Brasil e que estava com o grupo pró-ditadura, foi derrubado no chão e atingido por chutes na cabeça. Sangrando, ele negou o pedido da **Ponte** de entrevistá-lo sobre as agressões que ele sofreu “A Ponte apoia essas coisas. Vocês são culpados”, disse aos berros.

 Em 2016, Leandro foi um dos organizadores de um protesto pró-Trump e aparece [neste vídeo da Ponte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHxYiKlQtw) fazendo um discurso em um inglês de difícil compreensão.

          Leandro se negou a falar com a Ponte para contar a sua versão: “Vocês defendem esse tipo de coisa” Daniel Arroyo Ponte Jornalismo   

   A GCM e a PM chegaram depois que os ânimos já estavam mais calmos. Contudo, em frente a Fiesp, um grupo de militantes do PCO (Partido da Causa Operária) tentou passar e a pancadaria recomeçou, mas foi controlada mais rapidamente. Um único manifestante ligado a movimentos antifascistas foi detido e reconhecido como um dos agressores por três militantes pró-ditadura. Dalton Henrique Araújo dos Santos foi colocado algemado na viatura da GCM enquanto levava um sermão de Davi Benedito, 57 anos. “Você acha certo isso, rapaz? Tomei três pauladas na cabeça, isso não é pra brincar, eu poderia ter morrido”, dizia o exaltado militante bolsonarista. Ao observar a nossa presença, ele assume um tom de denúncia. “Eles não vieram para brincar, vieram para arrebentar. A gente está só comemorando 64, isso é um direito. Vivemos na democracia. Eles vieram do Masp para nos arrebentar. O que eles fizeram hoje com a gente foi um crime. Nós estávamos pacificamente, vieram os militantes do PCO, jogaram spray de pimenta no meu olho”. Argumentamos que era uma militante pró-ditadura que ostentava um spray, inclusive atingindo a reportagem, mas ele argumentou que era impossível que ela o atacasse porque eram conhecidos. “Quem jogou foi um moleque que veio me dar porrada depois”, encerrou.

 Na frente da delegacia, militantes bolsonaristas e pró-ditadura se uniram e passaram a fazer ameaças ao único detido do domingo, ligado ao movimento antifascista. “A gente vai acabar com ele a hora que sair por essa porta”, disse um rapaz que vestia uma camiseta escrito Exército Brasileiro. Enquanto o delegado decidia como ia conduzir o caso, policiais militares chegaram com dois detidos. Os pró-ditadura se alvoroçaram e quando o porta-malas da viatura abriu, Isabelle, que a todo tempo fazia stories contando ter sido agredida na Avenida Paulista, fotografou a dupla e postou nas [redes sociais](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/redes_sociales) com a seguinte legenda:

 Detalhe: os dois não tinham nada a ver com a ocorrência na avenida Paulista e estavam sendo presos por outro motivo.

 Como a tentativa de assoprar velinhas para o golpe de 64 não deu certo na Avenida Paulista, os militantes pró-ditadura levaram o bolo na noite deste domingo e cantaram os parabéns em frente ao 78 DP, onde a ocorrência foi registrada. Uma das testemunhas relatou à Ponte que uma confusão aconteceu no interior da delegacia e o computador onde era registrada a ocorrência desligou perdendo grande parte dos depoimentos.

 O delegado Mauricio de Thomazi Guedes ponderou que o caso é complexo por envolver muitas versões e que precisará de diversas diligências ao longo da semana para chegar a alguma conclusão para um possível inquérito. “As partes alegam versões conflitantes que precisam ser melhor esmiuçadas e colhidas de forma serena bem como perquiridos alguns aspectos fáticos relevantes, tais como as extensões das lesões de todas as partes, a intenção dos agressores, as circunstancias que cercaram os fatos, em tempo adequado e longe das paixões despertadas no calor dos fatos”, escreveu o delegado no B.O..

 A ocorrência foi qualificada como lesão corporal de natureza grave e ameça, as vítimas estão “a esclarecer” e o delegado ouviu 5 pessoas como testemunhas e 8 pessoas – entre pró e contra ditadura – como “partes”. Dalton, o único detido, foi liberado e deverá ainda ser ouvido ao longo da semana. A taser de Isabella foi apreendida e o delegado confirmou que é uma arma, embora possivelmente de origem paraguaia, de uso restrito. “Pode matar gente cardíaca, por exemplo”, disse um investigador no corredor da delegacia.

Because taking the UK out of the EU can be done in multiple ways leading to different outcomes, a second question is needed to check which option should be pursued if (and only if) this fundamental change in the UK's international relationships is effected.

But that in itself is an arbitrary way of framing the issue. The underlying problem is ""what does in/out of the EU"" mean? When leave unexpectedly won the referendum, the first thing remainers did was to redefine ""brexit"". They suddenly started using the terms ""soft brexit"" and ""hard brexit"". Nobody had used these terms before the referendum. It was done so that ""soft brexit"" could be portrayed as the sane, sensible way of ""leaving"", while ""hard brexit"" was for ""brexit ultra extremists"". For most leavers ""brexit"" meant the same thing as ""hard brexit"". Which is why we now have a situation where 70% of the people who voted to leave the EU want no deal, because they see May's deal as brexit-in-name-only. Meanwhile, the remainers have since redefined May's deal as a ""hard brexit"".

&gt; That is the first decision the UK should make, followed by what sort of  future relationship it wants to have with the EU in the short term (even  no deal will eventually mean an agreement of some sort, but it may take  a while). 

But that doesn't work. For me, the best outcome currently on offer is no deal, followed by remaining as a full member. All flavours of ""soft brexit"" - all the compromise options which take us out of the political structure but leave us in the customs union with no control over it, and/or continue free movement (etc..) are worse than remaining.

Depois de um trágico evento, ele conhece uma cientista que promete uma alternativa ao ocorrido: uma forma de viajar para outras dimensões e refazer seus próprios passos, mas que ainda é um experimento dessa cientista. A história é bem agradável e tem alguns momentos dramáticos, e mistura bem os elementos de ficção científica e fantasia.

Além disso, ela possui uma aparência singular que a destaca dos demais. Quando ela conhece Vore, um passageiro com a aparência e odor diferente dos demais, mas parecido com a própria Tina, ela começa a suspeitar dele.

It's kind of late for the center of Europe \[C: Andorra is not in Central Europe obviously, but this is exactly what the transcript says\], but that's just how life runs here - hasteless, for example: state of war with imperialistic Germany declared during WWI was suspended only in 1957. The country was forgotten during the arrangement of the Versailles Treaty and its people might have forgotten about that as well. But there were times, when Andorra was the only terrestial route from Europe to Spain and this route was very busy: be it crusades or Napeleon with his idea of world domination. And what is it like, to lie on a military road? You get plundered by the Reds, then you get plundered by the Whites \[C: ""Reds"" and ""Whites"" are colloquial names of two biggest factions of the Russian Civil War\]. So, seriously speaking, state of the principality was in direct correlation with the state of its roads: the worse are its roads, the better it lives. One should note, though, that country's enroute location was the definitive prerequisite for its independence. Legend has it that Charlemagne granted this part of Barcelona principality (then part of France) independence in gratitude for the help of locals, who guided his army through Pyrennes into present-day Spain, where he defeated Moors.

If voters wanted to say that they don't like the Conservative way of doing things, they had to tactically vote Labour, regardless of Labour's manifesto, in order to reject the Conservative government. This is because if they voted for anyone other than Labour, they would be splitting the dissenting vote, meaning that the conservatives would gain seats.

In a constituency where the vote is split as 36% Conservative, 32% dissenting party number 1 and 32% dissenting party number 2, it goes down as a Conservative win and suddenly 64% of the electorate in that constituency are represented by 36% of the vote.

In order to prevent this, the dissenting votes have to unify under one party, and the one that is most likely to get enough votes to win a seat is the largest opposing party - which is Labour.

So voters had to vote for a party which has leaving the EU in its manifesto in order to create effective opposition to the incumbent government, otherwise they'd give the incumbent government mandate to do whatever the hell they want.

Which is why its disingenuous to say that 80% of the electorate voted for a leave party, without mentioning the huge amount of context behind that vote. It's being used to imply that 80% of the country want brexit and that is patently false.

Bringing up FPTP vs PR or STV or AV or whatever other system is completely besides the point.

As /u/No_Engineering points out, you’re talking about Brigham Morris Young, aka Madame Pattirini. B. Morris, was Young’s son by Margaret Pierce.

The 11 year old Apostle was John Willard Young who lived lavishly on the church’s dime until his father’s death. He loved New York and spent most of his adult life there. He spent much of his life working for the church securing eastern money for church projects, working for Utah statehood and securing funds for railroads and the like. But the younger Quorum members hated him to a man and dropped him as soon as the older generation died out. Thus forcing the lifelong banking agent to get a job as an elevator operator. 

As another interesting aside John W, also was peripherally involved in he murder of a prostitute. While he was on a trip to Europe police discovered that his apartment was a scene of a murder. Anna Pulitzer’s mutilated body was found in the river but she was quickly traced back to John’s apartment.

1. The immigrants that came from the EU to the UK under the single labour market were skilled workers that complemented understaffed sectors of the UK economy. 2 famous cases would be the Construction and healthcare sectors. Currently there the NHS experiences a severe labour shortage (it was considered to be borderline a national emergency in September). Same with many construction firms.

2. I assume you are referring to immigrants from Muslim countries. Most Muslim residents in the UK are at least second generation immigrants. The Muslim first immigrants come and came to the UK due to reasons completely unrelated to the EU (e.g  family members of UK citizens that may have lived there during and after the British Empire)

3. I assume you are also referring to the wave of refugees that has come to Europe in the past few years? It’s impact has been negligible at best and has not caused even close to as many problems as you would like to think. Strictly economically speaking it would actually be beneficial for the competitiveness of the EU economy.

4. None of the terrorists that have been involved in the recent terror attacks in Europe has been a refugee. They were either a permanent resident of the country or travelled with a fake passport.

5. The UK has a lot stricter laws around hate speech than most EU countries. The EU did not set these laws, the EU does not even concern itself nor imposes any particular laws as far as the political system of a country are concerned, the only requirement being that the country is a constitutional democracy.

Valkorion originally was just a warlord on the planet Zakuul, which is in the Unknown regions.  Following the events of KOTOR, Vitiate took Valkorion as a host body, while simultaneously controlling another host on Dromund Kaas and doing normal EU Sith Emperor stuff.  As Valkorion, he united the people of Zakuul and built up a powerful and advanced civilization.  Hundreds of years pass, and while the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic fight and weaken each other, Zakuul grows and strengthens. Vitiate then abandons the Empire, so they no longer recognize his authority, especially after he tries to eat all life in the universe on Yavin/Ziost.  Then Vitiate/Valkorion leads a crusade into the rest of the galaxy, and generally wipes the floor of the Empire and Republic, not letting anyone know of his true identity.  The Player character of SWTOR finds and kills him, but Vitiates spirit enters his body in the process.  The player then builds a coalition of Empire and Republic forces to defeat Zakuul, now led by Valkorion's son and daughter.    The player succeeds, but then Vitiate fully takes over the PC (surprised pikachu).  You then kill him in your own head, finally defeating him once and for all.

In 2014 I voted for them in the European elections. Then in 2015 I voted Labour, because I was in a Tory-Labour swing seat and hoped for a Lib-Lab coalition. 2017 saw me vote Labour because I was in a safe Tory seat where the Lib Dems were crushed in the previous election. The Lib Dems' continued pro-EU stance put me ideologically in line with them, but I just wanted my vote to help shift the Overton Window leftwards and maybe move my seat towards a wobbly Tory seat rather than safe. Then last year I voted for a Lib Dem councillor. I'd describe myself as a social democrat rather than a socialist.

UKIP also treats cooperation between the interests of class and race (and sexuality) as a betrayal of a traditional, white Britain. You could be right, it's more of a fully audible whistle here. That is why Clive Lewis was so incensed by this speech and those defending it:

""So to hear ED talking about empathising with Tommy Robinson’s supporters and their hatred, yes against the so called liberal left – which given the debate was also shorthand for left Remainers – many of whom are black for the reasons stated above, and how he spoke of black people being used as pawns to subvert the (white) working class (why make a distinction of colour if not?), then I have to say my fucking alarm bells start ringing.""

&gt; Aviation continues to enjoy tax-free status when it comes to fuel, no value-added tax is charged on tickets and airlines are eligible for free carbon permits under the ETS. T&amp;E added that &amp;quot;It is no surprise that the most undertaxed mode of transport is also the one with the fastest growing CO2 emissions&amp;quot; and called for the sector&amp;#039;s permits to be withdrawn.

&gt; The tax situation could change though, after Belgium, the Netherlands and France all suggested that kerosene levies and VAT on tickets could be options to help cut transport sector emissions.

They've worked to establish their financial stability FOR THEM to enjoy, not for you to benefit from by default as their child.

&gt; For them, if it's not a tangible thing that they can buy, then it's not  worth spending the money on. I, on the other hand value experiences over  material possessions, so we've always disagreed there. And this is  becoming one of those disagreements. 

You've asked them to contribute, and they've settled on the value they're willing to contribute. This isn't a negotiation, it's a gift to you and your future husband and you're acting like you're somehow entitled to more? 

&gt; in the last 3-4 years they've built a $40K garage, bought 2 $50k trucks,  a $25K camper/rv and a $30k boat. Not to mention a $100k home remodel  when they downsized and endless yard projects on their 5 acres in the  country. They're both retired, but in this time they've barely been on  any kind of vacation. 

They've done the things that they enjoy doing since they retired, and they're not required to take a vacation to validate some weird expectation you have of what retired people do and how they ""should"" be spending their money. It's THEIR money.

Ya, well you and your fiance have been together for 8 years and could have spent that time saving, so it's not like YOU couldn't see this coming. 

My husband and I were together over 10 years before we got married in my late-20s. Our budget was $15K, but it was very difficult to keep our budget to that amount. My parents offered $5K since they paid for my sister's traveling around Europe. I didn't ask for receipts to make sure I was getting a fair share, I cried and said thank you and had a kick ass party.

&gt; I'm just asking for a little more help to pull off a nice event with good food, a few beers and good company 

It's YOUR wedding that YOU need to budget for what YOU can afford. You're not asking for a little more, you're asking your parents to give you double what they have offered, and actually you want them to pay for half of your wedding.

&gt;When you boil your comments down to their core arguments what you are saying is that, the contents of the reactor are highly radioactive, remote repair will be necessary, and if anything goes wrong it will be expensive.

&gt;Do I understand you correctly?

233C's response:

&gt;**That's pretty much it.**

-------------------------

Yes repair work will be done remotely and that is expensive, but this is factored into the cost projections already, and it is projected to be cheaper than coal even with remote repair work.

Yes fission products are HIGHLY radioactive, I wouldn't want to sleep on a bed of spent fuel rods either. 

The issues he raises are non-issues already accounted for.

To freewheel through idyllic countryside, relishing the cool breeze and glorious scenery sweeping by? To make new friends and admire cultural sights? To enjoy jovial banquets of local food and wine, somehow hoping that the kilos gained will be miraculously offset by the next day’s furious pedalling?

All this came true on my four-day ride through the forests and valleys of southern Transylvania, but there was an unexpected bonus. It was a cultural discovery that elevated an enjoyable break into a brush with the extraordinary, and it begins in 1153 with a long-forgotten king, Géza II of Hungary.

At that time this bucolic plateau cradled by the Carpathian Mountains, which only became part of Romania a century ago, was forever fearful of invasion from the east. In response, the monarch invited German-speaking mercenaries from the Rhineland and Moselle region to defend his borders. Collectively known as Saxons, they settled here for more than 800 years, building robust villages with deftly fortified churches. Devout and talented craftspeople, this industrious community farmed and worshipped with a zeal still evident in the sturdy towers, monumental barns and majestic oak forests that now form the picturesque backdrop to our 115km ride.

Then, in 1989, following the collapse of communism, almost all of them went home — invited back to their ancestral soil by the German government. “There were 1,200 Saxons here before the second world war,” reflects Rosemarie Müller, a teacher in the village of Altina. “Today there are 54.” As she shows me round its elegant church, Müller explains how when a departed villager passes away its bell is rung in tribute — most recently for a 94-year-old man who had fought for the SS and recently died in the United States. A Sunday service still takes place here, with a congregation of 20 at best, stoically singing hymns beneath walls adorned with exquisite 15th-century frescoes

All this makes poignant viewing, but we are not touring ghost villages. While some Saxon houses are boarded up, many have new residents — principally families of Romanians escaping the urban rat-race and savvy western Europeans who have snapped up a cut-price second home. “You can buy a house here with two plots of land for €10,000,” says Marco Nawijn, one of our two guides. A lanky Dutchman, he moved here in 2000 after falling in love with Transylvania’s fence-free grasslands and venerable forests filled with truffles and brown bears. His wife, Donate, is one of several talented chefs who prepare the marvellous feasts for our 12-strong group, where we sit at one big table tucking into dishes of spiced cabbage stuffed with minced pork and farm cheeses drizzled in local honey, all followed by plum cake and fiery tots of palinka (fruit-based brandy).

Our first night is spent in Richis, a village that once traded barrels of wine for Turkish carpets, where I’m billeted in an enchanting Saxon house with an enclosed courtyard, barn and orchard. The next morning we kick off with a 27km ride, and I’m pleased to find our tour company, The Slow Cyclist, advocates both the “slow” lifestyle and a modest rate of pedalling.

Oli Broom, its genial founder, is clearly at home in the saddle having cycled from London to Australia in 2009-10 to watch the Ashes cricket series. That epic journey took him almost 14 months, and setting up our impeccably structured ride has taken nearly as long. “Most of our clients are over 50,” he says, “and only two per cent sport Lycra.” This is borne out by my fellow cyclists who hail from the US, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Many are retired and while one couple has done some serious long-distance cycling and others regularly “chew the handlebars”, the rest of us are content to simply work off the lavish breakfasts. Thanks to the miracle of electric bikes, no one is left behind panting in the buttercups. Half of us have booked one and the benefits don’t just come when a hill looms. They are a boon pedalling into the wind, on boring busy roads, and fleeing ferocious sheepdogs.

Almost half our route is on tarmac back-roads, the remainder on forest tracks or across meadows. Soon we are strung out like a row of fairy lights with a guide at each end, happily ducking in and out of conversations and admiring the fields and vineyards where the Saxons toiled. Seven of their most impressive villages have been inscribed on Unesco’s World Heritage list, including Biertan, where Nawijn shows us its citadel-like church, pointing out the “bacon tower” where food was stored during sieges and a chamber in which couples considering divorce would be locked up and told to sort themselves out.

While this flagship attraction is in healthy condition, elsewhere a battle is being waged to save the splendid buildings the Saxons walked away from. In Copsa Mare, where we stop for lunch, we find a large sign erected by conservationists urging residents to renovate their new homes in a historically sympathetic manner. A big “DA” next to photographs of wooden shutters and terracotta tiles makes it clear that a traditional look is desirable, while gaudy pink walls or a bright red modern roof are most definitely “NU!”.

Some of us feel such advisories are an interference too far, but others, myself included, are in full support. One such campaigning group is the sweetly named Ambulanta Pentru Monumente (Ambulance for Monuments). When I later meet Veronica Vaida, one of its leaders, she explains that their motivation stems from nothing more than the fact that “these buildings are beautiful and we can’t bear to see them fall apart”.

Rescue methods take many forms, from the establishment of a kiln that makes authentic roof tiles to “interventions” when a volunteer team descends on a building to carry out preservation work. This recently happened in Copsa Mare, where the church roof has been repaired, and Vaida admits it is easier to protect such communal buildings rather than private dwellings. “How do you feel about garden gnomes?” I ask when we spy a few chuckling away by a garden fence. “They are necessary kitsch for someone,” she sighs.

We don’t always cycle. After a hearty meal of chicken stew, fresh strawberries and an excellent Liliac wine, Nawijn announces that we will now walk 3km uphill. He doesn’t lie. “When will they invent electric legs?” one of us wails, but the Transylvanian countryside is so captivating it deserves appreciation on foot. Travelling in early May we are too soon to catch its famous wild flower meadows in their full glory, but the landscapes are sufficiently enchanting to make us wonder why the Saxons left all this for the traffic-filled streets of Munich and Nuremberg. We are told their lifestyle was already on the wane — after the war thousands were sent to Soviet labour camps, and then their lands were taken away by the communist regime.

That night we slip back to the 18th century with a stay at Apafi Manor, a hilltop mansion in Malancrav restored by the Mihai Eminescu Trust, which is dedicated to the regeneration of Transylvanian villages. With its formal gardens, pared-down bedrooms and huge library of English-language books, some of us wish we could hole up here for a day or two, playing the piano and reading Rousseau. But no — we have 40km to gobble up in order to reach Sighisoara, a city that has the misfortune to be the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler and has the plastic axes and Dracula souvenirs to prove it. Conscious of this tacky side, Broom checks us into the well-appointed Fronius Residence, where we march in like a weary, mud-splattered platoon then later emerge clean and refreshed for a slap-up private dinner of wild garlic soup, stuffed eggs and cured meats.

Over the next two days, as we cycle and hike to Crit and then Mesendorf, we hit our rhythm. By now we are bonded and fit, and we adore our magical rides across hills like green corduroy and long descents on narrow trails that weave through the silent heart of ancient forests pierced by sunbeams. At Viscri, ahead of our farewell meal, we sit outside a bar chatting till the cows come home — literally. Their daily return from the fields, along with a clutch of horses, is a thousand year-old spectacle, a bovine paseo that brings every villager into the main street to watch as each animal dutifully peels away from the herd to enter its respective barn.

Transferring back to Sibiu airport by minibus the next morning, I look out from the motorway at the flat fields and dull industrial buildings and think how easy it would be to pass through Transylvania and assume there was little to see. As this most stimulating journey reveals, rich rewards await those who explore its hidden corners on two wheels, from the utter joy of whizzing downhill at 40kph dodging cowpats to the compelling story of the pious Saxons who farmed and flourished here for eight centuries. As one of their many wall-hangings, lovingly embroidered in Gothic lettering, reminds us: Ein fröhliches Herz nicht Gold und Pracht ist was den Menschen glücklich macht (A cheerful heart, not gold and splendour, is what makes people happy).

His claim is

&gt;If you import 10,000 Africans, that will multiply to like 80,000 in 20-30 years, and then ~500,000 in 50-60 years, and then after 3 generations you have multiple millions of them

So in ~25 years, roughly 5,000 couples will produce 70,000 children. That's 14 children per couple in 25 years. I'm not going to bother with the math for the rest, but it's just as ridiculous.

Eastern European and slavic countries have demographic problems. The answer to that is to fight corruption and build up the countries to make them worth living in so the youth doesn't run away to Germany. Not to lie about refugees running away from wars to turn them into scary monsters so that people think that refugees are the root of the problem.

&gt;and IQ

IQ results are affected by so many factors. Of course countries with poor economies and poor education infrastructure will do worse than others. And of course countries with education systems that closer match what kind of skills an IQ test requires will do better. It's not a genetic issue, it's so much more than that.

I mean, historically minorities haven't really had any sort of major political power, so why would you expect any meaningful majority of them to ""have much to offer to the political theory discussion""? All I see here is that the white liberals get to win twice.

[],Intranetusa,1388905461.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ens8u,False,"&gt;According to the Osprey Books on the Han Dynasty

The Osprey books also portray the Han Dynasty troops as wearing European dragon scale armor, using Persian style square wicker shields, and having fictional bamboo shafted metal spears. The book also portray soldiers as wearing bare brown rawhide when we know that armor was actually lacquered and painted thanks to archaeological discovery of pigments and trace elements on the terra cotta warriors. Needless to say, much of the Osprey stuff is based on outdated or incorrect information. New records and new archaeological discoveries have invalidated much of Osprey's stuff on the Han Dynasty.

&gt; their levy troops were scarcely trained 

The Han milita troops were trained for 1 year and served for a year. Roman troops by the time of Vegetius were trained for ~4 months according to Vegeitus' De Re Militari. Many Roman troops would gain more experience through constant campaigning because soldiering was their jobs, but in terms of their actual initial training, they received less basic training time than Han troops. Though Roman auxillaries, who made up an equal number (and later a superior number) to the legionaires, would probably be trained less than this. The 1 year training also applies to the Han's volunteer and levied militas, and may not apply to the Han professional armies who could receive even more training.

&gt; had awful cavalry (except for a few barbarian allies)

Nope. The Han Dynasty defeated the Xiongnu Confederation on their home terf in the steppes and deserts of Central Asia, Mongolia, and Russia. The defeated northern Xiongnu had to migrate west, possible eventually becoming the Huns.

The Han Dynasty also sent an army into Ferghana to capture a Greco-Persian city so they could get Nisean horses (the same horses the Persians used for their cataphracts). 

You can say their cavalry wasn't that great in the beginning, but they implemented a many decades long program to breed more and better horses, train more cavalrymen, and beef up their cavalry forces.

&gt;(not that they had to be, as all of their enemies were far smaller than they were numerically)

Not always. They were outnumbered in many of their battles against the Xiongnu as it is difficult to send a huge army hundreds of miles into deserts and steppes.

&gt;their infantry were almost all completely unarmored,

Incorrect. The terra cotta soldiers of the preceding Qin Dynasty shows many of their infantry were armored. The Han Dynasty improved on the Qin armors. The Han used many troop types - light, medium, heavy, etc - so they had plenty of lightly armored troops, but also plenty of heavily armored troops.

Archaeology has unveiled a lot of new stuff on Han armor...for example, check out the Han lamellar with armored sleeves that almost go to the elbows, or mural depictions of armored cavalrymen with armored collars.

&gt;Both the Romans and the Chinese of this period relied on sword and shield wielding infantry

Incorrect. Most of the Han's troops were equipped with pikes, swordstaffs, halberds, and crossbows - not swords. IIRC, the Chu-yen slips excavated from Han era armories/garrisons showed 80-90% of the weapons were polearms and crossbows.

&gt;the main advantages the Chinese had over their enemies were sheer numbers and technological superiority,


Most Han armies weren't that big. They initially tried to send many divisions of pike, halberd, and crossbow infantry after the Xiongnu early in the Xiongnu-Han Wars, but they got completely outmaneuvered. The cavalry and mounted infantry expeditionary armies that were more successful in defeating the Xiongnu were sometimes inferior in size.

You're also forgetting superior training. Pike formations and crossbow volley fire formations don't appear out of nowhere. Read some works by Rafe de Crespigny and others:

""...in the winter of 167/168 identifies the weapons and units of his army: ...'three ranks of [long] halberds (changzu) sowrdsmen (liren) and [long] spearmen (changmao), supported by crossbows (qiangnu) with light cavalry (jingji) on each wing.'"" -(p. 157 Fire over Luoyang: A History of the Later Han Dynasty 23-220 AD By Rafe de Crespigny

""The Han introduced the concept of massed crossbow attack by line of crossbows, and even mounted crossbowmen. Range would be about 280 meters. Just how powerful a crossbow could be, is glimpsed in the excavated Chu-yen slips from which records of crossbow maintenance was kept....typical Han era crossbow of 6 stone [~387lbs]""

(History &amp; Uniforms 9 ENG By Bruno Mugnai)

""Crossbows remained one of the major weapons in Song times. In the eleventh century, Shen Gua argued that the crossbow is to the Chinese what the horse was to the Khitan -- the asset that gave them their advantage. In field battles against foreign cavalry, the Chinese infantry would have a row of pikemen with shields, rows of archers, and a row of crossbowmen. When the cavalry approached, the crossbowmen would shoot first above the crouching pikemen and bowmen. The pikemen and archers would shield the slower-firing crossbowmen, who, however, could inflict more damage."" https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/miltech/crossbow.htm https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/index.htm 

The historian here, Patricia Buckley Ebrey, mostly specializes in Song Dynasty history, but the tactics are applicable to earlier eras as well. One of the videos below or another article discussing mentioned similar tactics dating back to the Warring States era.

""The Qin also employed long spears (more akin to a pike) in formations similar to Swiss pikemen in order to ward off cavalry. The Han Empire would use similar tactics as its Qin predecessors. Halbers, polearms, and dagger axes were also common weapons during this time.""

""Finally, the Qin and Han Dynasties also developed crossbow shooting lines, with alternating rows of crossbowmen shooting and reloading in a manner similar to a musket firing line.""

Just from observing alone, we can infer all kinds of micro-narratives that played out as different reddits mobilized their people/resources to try and gain recognition and a place on a trending platform. 

What is to be said about America's presence on the internet at the time, as they tried to dominate the center space, fighting valiantly to maintain that top podium as the entire internet was attacking 'round the clock. Almost decimated in the constant onslaught, but like the poem says, in the waning hours ""our flag was still there.""

Or the German's forgoing the center space in an attempt to banner a sizeable portion. Then, with their French counterparts attempts at intersecting them vertically to cut them in half, the two sides inadvertently reopened the Balkans for civil unrest as various ex-Yugoslav states began invading the battlefield and establishing their own territorial claims. Then the divulsion into a patchwork of Euro states, as Germans fought to hold off their eastern front from fractals of barbarian clans chipping away at them, and the European Union was established as a buffer state between the *Carolingian* factions. They've been fighting each other for that middle space since 833 CE.  

Scandinavia set themselves up in the top rafters and masterbated ""Dutch Rudder""-style.

Britain held their own. Canada grew three sizes. Ireland started tall, got taller. Scotland held their own too, might have some overlap though with Chelsea fans because clearly people like them a little more than an entire country. 

The *Mona Lisa* was hung on the wall, beside her sister in liberty, the Star Spangled Banner. In the midst of this microcosm of European warfare over the last 1.5 milenia, Switzerland set itself up in the bosom of Da Vinci's masterpiece, high on the hills above the other warring Germanic and Slavic states. Asserting its neutrality and geometric flag, lovers' of art and art critics alike came together to agree that the Swiss deserve recognition and safety from the other squabbling Euro-states. It is the first time in the entire history of human civilization that the art world has shared consensus on one particular thing, and it happened on reddit. Checkmate, atheists.

A genius somewhere came up with the idea of recreating the Windows 95 taskbar. I applaud you, whoever you are.

Very interesting how that tends to work out. Anyway...

America in the 1960s was basically a giant mish-mash of Europeans from all over the continent, and it was better than today by far. Ethnic conflict was an absolute dream compared to today and seemed to have been based on religious differences that never really caused any major conflicts. White-on-white crime in America was and is very low. Therefore, it would appear that different European ethnicities can assimilate quite well with each other. The same is demonstrably not true of non-whites in the same country. 

I think we're getting into the weeds here, mostly because you've derailed the topic to focus on pointless minutia.

Yes. Mostly those who develop multi-resistant TB have had it before, at least once. First hand treatment in most cases is still very good and very responsive. Luckily in the UK our contact in minimal and cure rates are very good because treatment is accessible. Hence places like Belarus and Moldova have harder time, with less treatment options. And if you have had it several times before - it is harder to get rid of the condition each time.  It comes back.  As said upthread, it is about close contact. as used to be the case in UK and Ireland 100 years ago - sharing certain conditions in poor housing. So your kids may not have any of the factors despite grandparents.  I had a relative in Ireland who died of TB in the 1960s because it came back and his lungs were shot. Not that long ago, really.

It was originally the new year, heralding the change of seasons in ancient and Medieval Europe, at least until they adopted another calendar and put January 1 as the New Year. April 1 then became a day where it was acceptable to prank people.

It's a tradition that still persists in the 2060s. And would cause more than a few issues in a warzone, when paired with a vindictive, hedonistic doll.

---

Commander Hams had hoped he was prepared for today.

He didn't mind the more harmless pranks. The ol' whoopie cushion, switching of salt and sugar, even the odd noisemaker, he'd simply let slide and quietly reassign the responsible parties to either watching Architect or cleaning the maintenance bays. The punishments would serve as a gentle reminder that pranking would not be tolerated, even if he did.

However, he had his eye on three possible, even dangerous, pranksters on his base. The first of which was blushing and fidgeting in her seat as she relentlessly shitposted.

""I trust that everything is well online and you're not spreading vicious, untrue rumours, MDR.""

In terms of deadly prankery, MDR's was dangerous in the psychological sense: a well-placed rumour could have sent the entire base either on high alert or in a huge mess.

""Um... no, Commander?""

In the week leading up to White Day, while he was testing a new IOP male doll model, he had tasked her with protecting him at night after two nights of very unwelcome guests in his bed. He had rewarded her with a place in his bed (and he swears he did not do anything she didn't consent to, meaning nothing happened).

And she had developed a very obvious crush on the hamster. Being extremely handsome did help.

""Good. Keep monitoring the Zenner Net and other digital channels for any problematic prankery.""

He considered MDR's sudden femininity adorable, and extremely useful. Which tied up one major issue.

The other was P7. Her pranks were a bit more obvious in effect. Ultimately less than lethal, her pranks could have serious issues on morale, but she had promised the commander that she'd limit herself to a single noisemaker-related prank. It didn't fully reassure him, but she also didn't want to sit and watch Architect channelling her inner tomato. She had been very insistent on that.

Which left just one unruly prankster.

He called Architect's guards.

""C-MS speaking, Commander~""

""Good afternoon, CMS. Is Architect in her cell?""

""The loud kitty-cat is playing with her right now. Can I get a popsicle when we're done? I've been good.""

""Yes, you'll get your frozen treat. Did ART556 come around?""

""...No? Architect doesn't like ART after ART stole her tomatoes and pelted her with them.""

""Keep your eyes peeled and there might be something else in it for you.""

""Okay, Commander~ Bye~""

A similar call to the armoury also yielded similar results. He'd told the armourers to double check everything and all stocks of ammunition, explosives and anything that could conceivably be used against dolls.

Which only left one place to ch-

""Yes, Springfield?""

""Commander, remember that time I found a certain jar of green liquid?"" Her voice was anxious.

""Springfield, I do, and that thing should have been disposed of by Biohazard.""

""Erm, actually...""

""Damn it, Springfield. We have humans on base and you kept COLLAPSE FLUID?""

""Collapse Fluid? Oh no...""

There was no time to regret anything. He would have to educate his division on dangerous Precursor artifacts and the Belian Incident on a later date. 

""Springfield, drop everything, grab your match-grade ammo and meet me in the office in one minute. MDR, put the entire base on NBC lockdown, right now. And... call SAT8. I am sadly in need of her... eccentricities right now.""

---

""Ladies, I have called you in here for a very important mission. ART556 has in her possession a jar of Collapse Fluid and she intends to use it on someone, presumably on one of the humans on base or worse, on me. Collapse Fluid is not only dangerous but also has deleterious effects on the environment that even dolls cannot work in for extended periods. I cannot stress the importance of not getting any of it on you, or on ANYTHING.""

The tiny commander looked at the three dolls standing in front of his desk.

""Springfield, you are to provide sniper fire. MDR, your energy shielding will be of use here. SAT8, since you're the one with actual NBC training AND having a history with ART, you're going to secure that damn jar before it leaks or breaks.""

""You are also authorized to use less than lethal force. That means arm and leg shots only. Try to take her alive or unconscious if it is reasonably possible. And no, SAT8, your restraining order still stands.""

The blonde Italian shotgun doll was crestfallen. Again.

---

ART556 was in very high spirits. She had stolen a jar of an unidentified green liquid she didn't even know the base had. Springfield had taken great pains to hide it, so it must be something super duper secret and would probably make the commander angry!

Good, she thought. The angrier the little killjoy was, the better, especially if the contents of that jar was emptied on him! And his cage! And his office! And everything he held dear!

That'll teach him to make me apologize to that Italian bore, she deviously reflected. How dare he interrupt my fun.

---

""There she is!"" Springfield shouted.

Shit, ART thought to herself. If Springfield was here, then that also means the tiny killjoy was nearby. They probably knew what she was going to do with the jar she had! There was no time to waste.

ART led Springfield and whoever was following her through a short run around the base. She did her best to ditch her captors, but even if she would lose one, another would pop up. In fact, she was most surprised when she saw MDR fire a burst at her.

""YOU TRAITOROUS THOT"" ART screamed at MDR. ""THE ONLY THING YOU WANT IS FOR THE COMMANDER TO HOLD YOUR HAND, YOU SLUTTY, LEWD SHITPOSTER"" Her angry insults had zero effect on MDR, who was not only carrying the commander in one of her MOLLE pockets but also knew everyone knew about her maiden heart anyway.

""Give it up ART. Whatever you're planning WILL go on your permanent record. And I have the authority to not only retire you but also charge you for your crimes done during your service! Drop the jar or I will order your execution, dismantling and erasure of your digimind!"" the commander was not pulling any punches.

""See if I care!"" ART was not giving up.

---

They had chased ART into... the mess hall. It was fortunate that no one was in it.

""ART, dear, listen to the Commander just this once, that's a very dangerous thing you're holding."" Springfield pleaded.

""That only means the Commander will get very mad!""

""Damnit ART, stop making this harder for y-""

""GO TOUCH YOURSELF TO THE COMMANDER PUTTING HIS ROBODICK INTO YOUR ROBOPUSSY, THOT"" MDR had to force herself to not cry. There was only so much abuse even the seasoned shitposter could take, especially if it was aimed at her maiden's heart.

""It's okay, MDR, I'm not judging you or anything.""

""Commander, this is getting nowhere. Permission to tackle her?"" SAT8 commed in, aggression creeping into her voice as she spoke.

""Denied. ART still has the jar.""

The tension in the air was thick enough to stop Jupiter Cannon rounds. ART only scowled at the three dolls and the commander.

""If you want this jar so badly, you can HA-"" 

""ART, catch!""

A flashbang grenade came sailing into the mess hall.

It exploded into a ball of light and sound.

This stunned ART briefly, which was long enough for SAT8 to manhandle the errant doll and disarm her of the deadly jar.

---

""P7."" The Commander addressed the average-sized doll dressed in a nun's habit while peeking out of MDR's combat gear.

""Yes, Commander?"" P7 put on her cutest face. She hoped that her cute self, coupled with the fact that she saved the Commander's life (in a sense), would allow her to worm her way out of trouble.

""A flashbang grenade is decidedly several degrees above a mere noisemaker, and you are not authorized to touch them.""

""But Commander, I came in at the right time to save you, so it's okay just this once?""

""Yes, P7, you do have a very cute point there. And for that,"" the commander motioned for MDR to let him out and to hand him off to P7. ""you are going to be tomorrow's adjutant.""

""Oh, commander, you should-""

""...Right after you report to CMS and IDW. You're fine with helping them guard Architect, right?""

""Yes, Comman- What.""

If there was one lesson P7 would never learn, it was that she could never out cute the Commander.

&gt;Warships 3D is customizable battleship-like game done in 3D environment with animations and cutscenes. Players can define their own rules like map size, which ships are available and at which events what weapons will be granted to player(s). The game is played in 2 stages, in the first stage the player places his ships on the opponent's map, while in the second stage the player's objective is to find and destroy enemy ships on his own map.

It has been made in Unreal Engine 4.

In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed over 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the city centre. An estimated 22,700 to 25,000 people were killed, although larger casualty figures have been claimed.

Other diagnostic tests are usually always denied and require a fight. 
I’m not very well read on the differences between NHS free healthcare and your privatized options though. 
Regardless, US’s private healthcare is pretty shitty.  Like for instance, I’m in an accident and taken to the ED. Even if that hospital accepts my health insurance, a lot of the doctors at the hospital aren’t directly employed by that hospital and one can be assigned a doctor that does not participate with your specific insurance company. They make you aware of this upon your admission, but at that point you’re really in no position to say “Thanks, but I’d rather go somewhere else.”  
So after that, and all the tests they run on you, your insurance may deny the treatment or since the attending doctor is ‘out of network’ you’re not just responsible for your regular out of pocket copay, but you’re charged with out of network fees. So for a hospital stay (maybe 3 days or so) might cost at least $25,000 and you are responsible to pay 40% of that out of pocket since that is what the out of network fee is for my insurance currently. 
I’m not speaking for everyone is the US, but I know that any of the PPO plans that are available to me where I live are all like this. It might be worse for people with HMO’s here, which is why I went for a PPO. Also went with the PPO because with my medical history I see a lot of specialists, and if I had an HMO I would be required to see my GP separately and get a referral before I could go see a specialist or my insurance wouldn’t allow me to see the specialist directly.   I’m oversimplifying a lot of the insane intricacies, but this is pretty standard for our healthcare system.

The industrial heartlands that modern tech hit the hardest lost a lot of jobs. According to Yangs numbers 4 million people lost their jobs and only 2 million of them ever returned to the workforce. Is it an accident that these areas have those huge suicide and particularly overdose spikes?

What sort of symptoms would an area have where a lot of jobs are getting wiped out have? Men with no futures tend to do very self destructive things...

&gt; What are you talking about here exactly? Do you mean the unemployment rate? Because in the EU, it's 6.5% right now, but in the U.S. it's 4%. So what are you referring to here?

Unemployment rate is easy as hell to manipulate, and measures an odd thing anyway.

Lets say we have 10 million unemployed people for 10% unemployment.     
Scenario A: We create 5 million new jobs and now have an unemployment of 5%         
Scenario B: 6 million people give up looking for jobs and now we have an unemployment of 4.25%

Is B *really* a better scenario? Almost a million people in the Rust Belt filed for disability after 4 million of them lost their jobs. Looks great for unemployment, but it's like the worst of all conceivable worlds.

Check out the stats here:   https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm

USA is at 71%, but UK is at 74.5%, Germany at 76%, Sweden at 77.9%, Switzerland at 80.3% and Iceland at a pretty staggering 85.3%.

Now we can ignore Iceland because it's tiny, but Switzerland is meaningful. If US had Switzerlands employment rate, we'd have to employ almost 20 million more people...

You have to admit that given those numbers claiming Iceland might have higher unemployment than the US is pretty ridiculous. Only thing it says is that US has a lot of people who've dropped out of the work force.

&gt; What makes you think suicides are ""spiking"" at all? And again, what makes you think it has anything to do with automation? Don't you find that to be an odd leap/assertion?

It's not a rock solid case, but the areas in the Rust Belt that got hit by the job losses have all been hit quite hard by this, while states that are enjoying modern economy jobs are doing better. [2005 to 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm).

&gt; Based on what? Where are you getting this idea from? How are you measuring the death of the middle class?

Gini index is a good one. [This](https://www.statista.com/statistics/203183/percentage-distribution-of-household-income-in-the-us/) also somewhat surprisingly for a Middle Class country is not a bell curve, but spikes up at both ends. 

Also anecdotally working in robotics, we keep aiming at the poor people making between $40k and $110k. Easiest targets. The cheaper people are competitive because they're so damn cheap. The people solving hard problems make way more than $110k. But those in the middle? Juicy targets.

&gt; The ""gulf"" between the rich and poor is not an issue as long as the standard of living for the poor continues to improve. Which it is

Is it? You should try to visit places like Western MA, Southern Ohio, all of WV etc. We've created a really pretty damn depressing and desolate area of the country that mimics the south in many ways.

The factory where we make our robots is in Southern Vermont and it can get pretty grim in the whole area. MA also has this vast group of people doing insanely well while the other half of the population is basically just living off meth and opioids (a little unkind, but the numbers kind of back me up).

&gt; It is a communist talking point you just cited--I don't know if you realize that

Not really. Poor economic mobility creates violence when people realize that they have no chance to make it to the top. And US has pretty miserable economic mobility these days. My kids will be basically guaranteed to be in the top 20% even if they fail at almost everything, for example.

&gt; Poor people in America live very, very well comparatively to poor people in say...Africa

Sure. But poor people in America have pretty horrible lives compared to poor people in Northern Europe, which I'd consider a more appropriate peer group. Instead of aiming to beat Africa, I'd like to try and beat the Netherlands and Switzerland. And we're really, really far from that.

&gt; Poor people in America have carpet on their floors, insulation in their walls, televisions, phones, and laptop computers all with internet access. 

... and a nice street corner to live on if someone gets sick enough. Or if people like me sell their employers good enough robots.

&gt; In America, our poor people are obese, whereas everywhere else in the world, their poor people are starving. Think about that.

Yeah because they can't afford fruit. I mean yes, you have me convinced that I'd rather be poor in the US rather than India or Nigeria, or even China. But that's a pathetic peer group to compare us to (no offense to any Indians, Nigerians or Chinese readers).

&gt; whereas everywhere else in the world, their poor people are starving

Except the roughly 600m people living in perfectly wealthy societies in Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Canada etc.

&gt; The only place I know of right now who is handling their drug addict problem (homelessness problem) properly is Rhode Island

Check out Portugal and Netherlands. They're doing very well with their drug addicts.

&gt; But this America you keep attacking as being great for rich people and nobody else well....that's not the America I see

To me being a $500 expense from a crisis is not ""great"". It's positively developing world. The precariousness of the life of many people in the US is just stunning for someone who has lived elsewhere in the developed world.

There are hundreds of thousands of medical bankruptcies (as many as a million a year!)

I think you're having something of a Stockholm syndrome because you don't know how much better a lot of people have it than they are in the US. 

People are stressed as hell over things they shouldn't have to be stressed over like healthcare and ability to get shelter.

Yes the  were explicitly antifascist, Nazis rejected everything the fascist philosophy stood for. 

Mussolini criticized Hitler so many times without success:

&gt; &gt; Nordicism and biological racism were often considered incompatible with the Italian fascist philosophy; Nordicism inherently subordinated Italians and other Mediterranean people beneath the Germans and Northwestern Europeans in its proposed racial hierarchy, and Italian fascists, including Mussolini, viewed race as a cultural and political invention rather than a biological reality.

&gt; &gt; In 1929, Mussolini noted that Italian Jews had been a demographically small yet culturally integral part of Italian society since Ancient Rome.

- Cagot

- Burakumin

- Jews

- Mandarins

- Kazoku 

- Slaves

- Lottery winners

- Every European ethnic group in America (North, South, everywhere)

- Brahmin

- Dalit

- Gypsies

- Muslims

- Copts

- Asians in general

- Huguenots/random Christian heretics/Protestants

- Sikhs

- European nobles in any country including the former-CCCP ones

- Kulaks

- Rich non-Guarani and Guarani

- Various Bon-guan (like in the Guarani example, people were forced *by law* to marry outside of their Bon-guan, and yet they still assortatively mated for status to the exact same degree as if they had mated in their clan)

- Mapuche (like the Cagot, Burakumin, and Slaves, not all of these are happy stories)

- Chileans (under Allende or Pinochet, it doesn't matter! The same holds for *anyone born under any junta that subsequently liberalised*)

- the Basque

- Way more.

Notably, Campbell &amp; Lee (2010, 2011) also interpret their Chinese status persistence data -- which occurred despite people being trucked across the country, clans being dissolved, communities displaced and destroyed, millions murdered, property expropriated and never returned, &amp;c. -- as consistent with the importance of kin networks and extended-family strategies (note: [not evidenced] (https://www.reddit.com/r/evopolitics/comments/b86692/z/ejwneuc) in a meaningful way in any of these works). Greif, Iyigun &amp; Sasson (2012) ran with this and held that the truth of this proposition in China explains why they had so much less technological development than Europe. But, it's true in *every single society on Earth to essentially the same exact degree, no matter the circumstance,* so why should it be an explanation for China? Why not Japan or Sweden? When it comes to the rest of these instances where people tend to offer very specific and largely *ad hoc* explanations, I don't see how they could possibly think arguing for sheer coincidence is productive.

&gt;1.) First and foremost, we need to know who we are letting into our home. We need to know their criminal records, any sign of extreme religious/political activism, etc. Make sure they aren't dangerous to the population. We need medical records to make sure immunizations are concurrent with our standards.

So registration? Not the worst thing. Some sort of record, perhaps a social security number isn't the worst thing to be giving people, but that doesn't seem to match what people are talking about when thyr refer to immigration laws. 


&gt;2.)Make sure they provide a net benefit to society. It's obvious what we as a country are offering them, but what are they offering us? Are they educated? Do they have marketable skills/trades? 

This is silly. We don't need to make sure they fit some high standard if they are are immigrating for that purpose. Often times immigrants must leave their nation because it doesn't offer them the opportunity to learn these things. 

&gt;Do they speak the language, or are they making efforts to learn the language so they will be able to assimilate? Look at how poorly the refugees are assimilating in europe while the vast majority just suck up benefits; they are a net DRAIN on society.

This is a bad take imo. America is regarded as a great melting pot Because of the cultures and languages and people we allow to thrive in our nation. It's the same reason America doesn't have an official religion or an official language, we want cultures to be able to grow and impact each other. 


&gt;3.) We can't possibly fix everybody's problems; it's just the way it is. 

I disagree with the way you present this. Sure we can't fix literally everyone and everything, but we should try to do as much as we can right? We should always be striving to help people rather than just clap are hands and say ""that's it, progress is done""

&gt;There are poor/violent countries everywhere, but if you start importing entire populations into prosperous/safe countries, you will reduce them to another poor/violent country.


Again I don't know that this is true. First, nobody is anywhere close to suggesting that entire populations would come and fill America. It's actually fairly absurd to think that is anywhere close to a possibility. Second, theres no evidence that that would actually reduce America to a worse state than it is currently at.

Cheap labor drives down the cost of labor for everybody who works (if the lettuce farm can pay an illegal $4/hr, wal-mart can pay a citizen minimum wage because they don't have to worry about competing for unskilled labor with the lettuce farm. if the lettuce farm pays $11/hr, wal-mart is gonna have to pay $11/hr or else all their employees are gonna go work at the lettuce farm), and illegals who work under the table aren't contributing tax money back into the system and often times they are sending money back home so the money doesn't end up back in circulation here. totally unfair to all taxpayers.

So they should pay taxes? That's already a law for everyone, I'm not sure how refusing immigrants at the border is a better way to fix this issue. 


&gt;5.) helps curb the human trafficking/sex slave issue


Fella, the people trafficing slaves are taking them *out* of America, in order to deal with that you would have to discuss the immigration laws of other countries. 


&gt;i won't count this as a point because it's my opinion, but putting the needs of illegals before our own poor/destitute populations and communities because it's politically advantageous to do so at this point in time is so egregiously offensive that it's almost funny.

It's not a zero sum game, you can focus on both. Matter of fact most of the politicians that push border security in America also push law's that actively harm the lower class in America.

Those who live anywhere outside London see the problem mass immigration forced by the EU has caused, I'm not blaming immigrants for this, its purely down to poor policies and planning. 

- British adults cant get jobs
- Public transport is massively overcrowded
- There is no housing for our children to live
- When people can get jobs, outside of being a graduate you get paid fuck all. 
- School are overpopulated meaning our children don't get the education they should.

In London you may tolerate these issues because all the investment is centred there but outside there is no investment. We don't see the advantages of immigration that you see. We just see the problems.

Whilst immigrants are not the ones who've cause this issue, something needs to be done to tackle these issues and the population staying the same/decreasimg is an easy way of doing that.

Adding to this it has created huge divides in our communities due to different ways of living, language, beliefs, what we eat, what we drink.

The EU as an advocate for immigration should have set out better policies to handle this, not just in the UK but across the continent. They have noone to blame but themselves for this mess.

I’m actually here to showcase not just the SM-39 Razor, but the company that produced the design: The shell corporation, Stavatti. Don’t fall for their futuristic designs; Stavatti is a scam and it has been since its inception. Just try not to laugh when you read about them.

First thing’s first, the SM-39 Razor:

The SM-39 is a next generation air superiority fighter and fighter-bomber. Designed to perform the missions of the F-22, F-15, F/A-18E/F and the now retired F-14 Tomcat and A-6 Intruder, the SM-39 is a twin engine, piloted or unpiloted autonomous, low observable aircraft. With two internal weapon bays, a variable dihedral empennage, double slotted flaps with boundary layer blowing, thrust vectoring nozzles and titanium foam metal sandwich construction, the SM-39 is a sixth to seventh generation fighter and a direct bridge between atmospheric aircraft and future reusable space fighters.

Of radical planform, the SM-39 is a triple fuselage design featuring a streamlined center, high fineness ratio primary fuselage accompanied laterally by right and left mounted secondary fuselages. The secondary fuselages begin as highly swept wing strakes into which the aircraft wing, empennage, an a single ventral air intake and engine nacelle is blended. This planform configuration results in a significant reduction in supersonic wave-drag, allowing the aircraft to have a volume distribution that is very near the Sears-Haack ideal. Designed for supercruise, this configuration places the wing leading edge within the shock cone of the secondary fuselage wing strakes at Mach numbers as high as 2.5.

In addition to reducing wave drag, the SM-39's triple fuselage design allows for a an efficient distribution of primary aircraft systems. The center fuselage houses principal avionics, including the radome and AESA radar, as well as the cockpit, nose landing gear and two internal weapons bays. The secondary fuselages are home to a high pressure recovery, serpentine variable geometry internal compression air intake, a single variable cycle afterburning powerplant and the main landing gear. Both the center and secondary fuselages house internal fuel tanks, sensors and electronic countermeasures. Distributing aircraft systems laterally as well as longitudinally, the three fuselages result in greater internal volume with lower overall wave drag than any supersonic fighter in service today.

Designed for airspeeds in excess of Mach 3, the SM-39 will be powered by two 50,000 lb class afterburning powerplants. These engines may be enhanced performance derivatives of the P&amp;W F119 or GE YF120, or next generation variable cycle powerplants. The current baseline design features a new design variable cycle turbofan/turbojet that benefits from a titanium diboride cermet compressor, combustor and turbine stage that allows TITs as high as 4,400º F, resulting in a maximum static thrust of 52,400 lbs with an SFC of 1.35. Cruise SFC of this new engine is predicted at values as low as 0.53.

For continuous high speed operations and a corrosion resistant 75 year operational life, the SM-39 will have titanium foam metal sandwich skins with a titanium diboride foam metal core. This nearly monocoque structure will be supporded by an internal framework of laser welded titanium frames, bulkheads and longerons.

Pioneering new approaches in aerodynamics, airframe structures, efficient variable cycle turbine propulsion, plasma low-observability and boundary layer control and integrated avionics, the SM-39 is a Mach 3.3+ fighter with a stall speed as low as 103 KTAS in the landing configuration.

It’s weird. I feel like if they knew what they were doing, their aircraft would eventually become a reality.

And about the company itself well, it was once thought as fantasy, but now they are straight up con artists:

One of the most successful modern individual disinformation campaigns is Stavatti Aerospace. It is a quasi real joint-venture company with a detailed background and information about its products. The main part was the Stavatti F-26 (later renamed SM-36) STALMA. So let's take a look at the sci-fi history: STALMA (Short Take off Advanced Light Multi-role Aircraft) began in 1989 as a concept of a lightweight, multifunctional, single-engine combat aircraft that could replace the F-16C at the turn of the millennium and F-18C. The emergence of the JAST and ASTOVL programs, which later merged into the JSF project, diminished interest in the F-26. However, the potential market, which in the first quarter of the 21st century would be in demand for nearly 6,000 lightweight multi-purpose fighters, was created in 1994 by a private joint venture from Stavatti Corporation, which took over responsibility for further development of the F-26. The company aims to satisfy 15% of this demand. Between 1995 and 1997, a definitive concept was created, which includes unusual negative dart tail ducks (leading edge -32 and drain -51 degrees), variable wing geometry (5 to 70 degrees), engine thrust vectoring, integral avionics and elements of stealth technology. These features are intended to allow the aircraft to have the characteristics of supercruise and super-maneuverability. The supporting parts of the structure are made of aluminum and titanium, almost two thirds of all materials are composites. They are intended to guarantee a life of at least 15,000 flight hours (or 4000 starts and 4,000 landings from the ship at sea). The propulsion unit consists of one Pratt and Whitney F119-PW-100 or PW F135 engine. Raytheon AN / APG-73 radar should be placed in front. Each wing has 4 suspension points, complemented by five on the hull, while the armor should not reduce stealth characteristics with the special RETSD ™ (Radar Elusive Tactical Stores Dispensers). Armament to complement the 20 mm M61A2 Vulcan cannon.

Stavatti heavy industries aerospace corp. F-26 SM-36 stalma stealth 6th generation fighter plane fake fiction
The first prototype was to take off in the course of 2004, then in 2006, later in 2009, and so it will move to infinity, because Stavatti Aerospace is just one big sophisticated fiction. Not that it does not exist completely - it is officially registered by two branches in Minnesota and in New York, and sometimes occasionally participates in various competitions for new military aircraft. But it is not an end in itself. The founder of the whole enterprise - young boy Christopher R. Beskar can officially show at least some activity and legalize his activity, consisting in catching stupid and ignorant investors who do not understand the aviation industry at all to invest their money in the company. It is clear that a promised five to twenty-fold yield in the event of success in a selection procedure will never be seen, but Christopher apparently suffices for a decent living. The only thing that has to be done is to occasionally upgrade the portfolio of its products to offer, as well as other types of SM-27 Machete, SM-81 Mamba and SM-46 Aviara. Want a business plan for other handy scammers? I hope not.

What this means is that, unless something is done to fix this, the government will not be able to pay out social security and Medicare for the next few generations. Those trust funds have given too much already and domestic and foreign investors aren’t really too hyped about loaning money to the government either. We can’t really raise taxes because of this phenomenon in which tax revenue always hovers around 17% of the GDP, which is a trend that has been around for at least a century. The only other outlet is to print more money, which means we will see more inflation. Inflation is mostly just a tax on raw savings that people have in their savings accounts. So that sucks.

If we took serious action right now to stem the bleeding, we could be at a point where we are making enough revenue to cover the interest on our unfunded obligations in a matter of just 5 years or so.

I’ve been searching this sub and the various sellers for about 2 months and finally decided to purchase the Balenciaga Speed Trainers with Laces from Ai. I used Ytaopal as my agent. I just sent them Ai’s Yupoo link to the shoes. 

The shoes arrived at the warehouse and the QC pics were uploaded today. 

To be honest I am a little sad with how the shoes look. I’ve uploaded the original QC pics and also edited some to show what I’m concerned about. 

First pic is top view. Marker 1 looks like a glue stain? Marker 2 also looks like a glue stain to me. Marker 3 and 6, I’m not sure if it’s the lightning or if its a stain. Marker 5 looks like the fabric for the lace ribbon is ripping/coming off? Marker 4 and 7, I’m not sure if it’s because of the way the shoes are placed but the Right shoe looks larger than the Left. You can also see that the lace ribbons are not aligned, but again that could be because of the way they are placed on the table. I’ve asked my agent to measure the insoles but it like 7 am over there right now so they prolly won’t reply until later today. Also not sure if it's just me but do the A's at the end of the Balenciaga look fine or are they sinking?

Third and fifth pic are the both sides of the shoe. There is a lot of glue stains along the tops of the soles. Is this something I can get rid of myself or should I RL?

Seventh pic are the back of the shoes. Again there are glue stains. The back seam on the Left shoe aligns through the N, I’ve added a line and drew the N and C as best as I can. The back seam on the Right shoe is perfectly aligned between the N and the C. Now I’ve read that the back seam on retails are usually aligned between the N and C but that there are some retailed that are misaligned as well.

Tenth pic is bottom of the shoes. Looks fine to me.

I’m leaning toward RL, but I’m not sure if that’s me being really picky or if the shoes could be better if I ask for another pair. I’ve tried looking for high detailed retail pics but they are mostly from the side. I know most people go for the regular Speed Trainers but if anyone could help me with QC these I’d really appreciate it! 

Edit: Also the shoes are a EU 38. I usually wear women's US 7.5-8, insoles usually measure 24.5 cm. I asked Ai what size I should get based on my insole measurements and he suggested EU 38. I will update with the insole measurements are my agent gets back to me.

Edit 2: My agent told me that Ai can't get me shoes better than this. Really disappointed. :/ I'm gonna refund. Don't like the look of the regular Speed Trainers so now I'm on the hunt for shoes again!

Edit 3: After thinking it over and looking the QC pics, others QC pics, and retail pics, I've decided to GL. I'll figure out a way to remove the glue stains myself.

read from the title ""From Star to Laggard""Economic growth has slowed to 1.75% and inflation has jumped drastically to nearly 4% (Holy shit on this btw, this is really bad. You produce less, everything costs more.)Yield curve is starting to invert, buisiness investment is approximately 10B pounds short of where it should be already.

Britain is on the cusp of a per-capita recession already, due to world economy. Add a no deal exit?It's going to be a blood bath, and an absolute struggle to limit the booming inflation and decreasing investment. Solutions are pretty limited: go the ""German"" solution post WW2, and experience intense hyper inflation as you print more money in an attempt to stave off the worst of the effects (Terrible policy, will almost certainly cause the worst possible outcome) or introduce austerity measures in an attempt to sever the tie between the inflation in prices from the difficulty in getting product, and the sudden lack of investment, which might save the economy from a massive heart attack... but that's completely different from living standards, and the money needs to come from somewhere, so living standards will be the first thing they look at pulling money back from.

Think about it: That missing 10 Billion pounds of investment... where is that going to come from now? How can a government pony up that cash? There's either the choice of raising taxes, (Impacts standard of living immediately) or cutting services (again, standard of living). There's no real solution to such a hit to the economy, especially when irrelevant of that lost investment, you are suddenly losing huge amounts of tax from business going off-shore, and all goods previously coming from EU, (Approx 242 BILLION A YEAR) costing more as you attempt to source it elsewhere. Then, you can't sell your own goods for as much, because the market that demanded 145 Billion a year worth of your goods, you suddenly have no trade deal with.

As a no deal brexit looks increasingly likely, and your parliament has honestly done sweet nothing in the way of preparing for this mess, you are looking like you are ending up shit creek without a paddle.This COULD be resolved with some serious political intervention NOW, and possibly walk out with no recession, but given the current aptitude of your political class? Good luck.

Either way, even if you guys scrape past a recession, your living standards are taking an inevitable hit, and it's not going to be a little one.

That damage currently happening with your buisiness?

Many have advocated we follow the UK/European path of having mandatory vaccines.

Vaccines are a tremendous benefit to people individually and society. However, they must always remain a *choice*. Without being a choice, there is a massive incentive imbalance.

On central banking, I see it as a necessary feature of the finance capitalism that emerged with the post-Thatcher/Reagan neo-liberalism. Central banking is used to quash any attempts at real reform (look at the EU and how capital restrictions are used to undermine the will of the people in member states), so I'd be happy to see it go away.

But MTG Editions are twice the size of a HS edition. So that rare per pack is way less meaningful.

We can also look at how many cards are made of each rarity:

You have 27 Epic in ~140 cards (19%). In MTG you have rare 54 in ~240 cards (22,5%).

We can also compare HS rares vs MTG uncommons: 36 in 140 (25,7%) vs 60 in 240 (25%).

For shits n giggles lets do Legendaries vs Mythics too: 23 in 140 (16,4%) vs 15 in 240 (6.25%)

So here Epic &amp; MTG rare align pretty equivalent too.


Then we have to take into account, that in MTG you can have 4x the same card in your deck and not only 2 (or 1 in the case of legendary vs mythic). 
Also dusting can be better than trading, since a high in demand card in HS is still the same price, where as in MTG chances are you won't find anyone trading you a set of that go-to rare from the new edition.


According to this site: https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics 

If you open 100 packs you'll end up with 20 Epics of 54 (2 copies each) existing ones or 37% 

If you open a MTG display (around the same price here in EU) you'll have 36 rares (+ 3-4 foils) of 240 (4 copies each) or 25%

Tl;dr - MTG rares are like HS epics, if not even harder to get.

PS: Those are only new MTG numbers though, since the sets became smaller. I don't have any numbers on the old big 350-450 card sets.

Ele segue, afirmando que naquele tempo o Brasil vivia sob ""a ameaça do comunismo"", algo amplamente difundido pelo presidente [Jair Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro), e contestado pelos historiadores, para justificar o golpe militar. “Havia sim muito medo no ar. Greve nas fábricas, insegurança em todos os lugares. Foi aí que, conclamado por jornais, rádios, TVs e principalmente pelo povo na rua, povo de verdade, pais, mães, igreja, que o Brasil lembrou que possuía um Exército Nacional. E apelou a ele”.

O Exército nos salvou”, repete ele. “E tudo isso acontecia num dia comum de hoje [sic], [um 31 de março](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/dictadura_brasilena)”. O vídeo não tem nenhuma marca do Governo ou de qualquer instituição oficial. Não foi veiculado em nenhum outro canal governamental, como site ou redes sociais (mas sim na página do [filho do presidente, Eduardo Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/eduardo_nantes_bolsonaro)). Tampouco foi publicado pelo Exército, que, ao final é mencionado por uma segunda voz que afirma que “o Exército não quer palmas, nem homenagens. O Exército apenas cumpriu o seu papel”. Até agora, mais de 24 horas após a veiculação, ninguém assumiu a autoria do material. O Planalto, por meio da Secretaria de Comunicação (Secom), confirma que o vídeo foi enviado pelo canal oficial no WhatsApp, mas afirma que não se pronunciará sobre o caso. Nesta segunda-feira, o vice-presidente Hamilton Mourão quebrou o silêncio sobre o caso e afirmou a um grupo de jornalistas em Brasília que o vídeo “foi divulgado pelo Planalto"" e que foi ""decisão dele [de Bolsonaro]” a sua veiculação.

 Fontes afirmaram à reportagem que o vídeo não foi enviado pela Secom e sim pelo Gabinete Digital, responsável pela gestão das redes sociais e portal do Governo. Questionada sobre a autoria do material e quanto ele teria custado, o Planalto silenciou, ferindo o artigo 5º da Constituição, que concede a livre manifestação do pensamento, mas proíbe o anonimato. Para Gil Castello Branco, do Contas Abertas, entidade que acompanha os gastos públicos, é importante que o Governo esclareça a origem do vídeo. “É preciso saber se foi pago ou não com recursos públicos”, diz. “Em segundo lugar, é preciso saber até que ponto legalmente essa mensagem estaria ou não compreendida dentro do que deve ser a publicidade institucional do Governo”. Ele afirma que independentemente da autoria do vídeo, o Governo endossa a mensagem enviada ao divulgá-la em um canal oficial.

 Bolsonaro, [que está em viagem oficial por Israel desde o domingo](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/04/01/opinion/1554078976_839038.html), mas segue verborrágico em suas redes sociais, não se pronunciou sobre o assunto e nem replicou o material em seus canais. Diferentemente de um de seus filhos, o deputado federal Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP), que publicou o vídeo em sua conta no Twitter logo pela manhã. Pelo horário da postagem, Eduardo Bolsonaro fez a publicação antes mesmo de ela ter sido enviada por WhatsApp.

 A improvável indiferença do presidente em relação a um tema tão próximo a ele não é mero acaso. Na semana passada, Bolsonaro, que não considera a data um golpe, mas sim um ""regime com autoridade"", recomendou que os quartéis comemorassem “a data histórica”. A polêmica diante da postura revisionista do presidente foi parar na Justiça, que concedeu, na noite de sexta-feira, [liminar proibindo as comemorações do golpe pelas Forças Armadas](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/03/26/politica/1553638410_317117.html). Mas, no sábado de manhã, a decisão foi revertida, [abrindo caminho para as celebrações](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/03/30/politica/1553963400_195148.html). Desde a redemocratização, é a primeira vez que o Brasil tem um presidente que defende as festividades dessa data.

 As questões não esclarecidas sobre o material fizeram com que a oposição levantasse suas orelhas no próprio domingo, quando prometeu entrar com representações em todas as instâncias possíveis para questionar o caso. De acordo com o deputado Paulo Pimenta (PT-RS), seu partido recorrerá ao Supremo Tribunal Federal e à Procuradoria Geral da República para denunciar os crimes de improbidade e responsabilidade. O deputado também promete convocar para prestar esclarecimentos na Câmara dos Deputados o secretário de Comunicação, que até o momento é Floriano Amorim.

 O WhatsApp do Governo é um canal criado ainda na gestão de Michel Temer e administrado pela equipe de comunicação do Planalto. Não se trata de um grupo, mas sim de um número que transmite para quem está na lista vídeos institucionais, como os que defendem a reforma da Previdência, e outros materiais de divulgação do Governo. Até o domingo, todo material enviado por esse canal tinha a assinatura do Governo Federal.

* Jennifer Fallon has a range of SFF books - my favourites are probably the **Tidelords** books (book 1 is the Immortal Prince) but her most famous are probably the **Medalon** ones (several related trilogies). She also wrote a sort-of urban fantasy (**The Undivided**) which satisfies the twin square, and a low fantasy (no magic) called the **Second Sons** trilogy. Her stuff is more political/intrigue than big fantasy plots, but they're not dense or depressing.

* Glenda Larke has particularly wonderful worldbuilding and non-medieval European settings - I particularly like her **Stormlords** books but she's got a bunch out, and she's great.

* Thoraiya Dyer's **Titan's Forest** trilogy is now all out - set in a giant multilayered rainforest. First book is **Crossroads of Canopy**.

* Russell Kirkpatrick is technically a NZ author but we stole him. He had several fantasy trilogies in the 00s but his new one is coming out with an Aus press at the end of this year (I think?), and it sounds amazing - called **Silent Sorrow**

* Kate Forsyth mostly writes historical stuff now but she had a successful 90s series called (I think) the **Witches of Eileanan**

* Leife Shallcross wrote a wonderful Beauty and the Beast retelling that came out last year in the UK and just recently in the US called **The Beast's Heart**, told from the Beast's perspective.

* Sean Williams has about forty books out, ranging from kids to adults, mostly SF but some fantasy - **The Books of the Cataclysm** are definitely fantasy.

* Kaaron Warren writes mostly horror, but she has some fantasy too - **Walking the Tree** is one I'm actually reading right now. She's won about every award we have.

* Margo Lanagan - try **Tender Morsels** for some dark fantasy

* Keri Arthur has a wildly successful urban fantasy series but the name is escaping me right now!

* Isobelle Carmody wrote one of the most successful and beloved Australian fantasy YA series - starting with **Obernewtyn**

* Kylie Chan writes Chinese-influenced fantasy - start with **White Tiger**

* Maria Lewis is both a delightful human and a great writer - look for **The Witch Who Courted Death**

* CS Pacat - best known for the  **Captive Prince** books

* Gillian Polack writes hard to pigeonhole literary-end SFF, usually strongly feminist.

* Corey J White writes more in the SF vein, not sure if that counts, but his main one is the **Voidwitch** saga

&amp;#x200B;

\#1. What are the different types of economist roles in financial services:

A. Do what I’m doing and use macro to inform portfolio decisions.

B. . Work on sellside and produce research clients will use and work closely with the sales teams and interact with clients.

C. Work as an internal economist for big financial firm where your forecasts will be used to inform internal strategy Positions.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2. How do you get there?

\-I'm acknowledging my path isn't the most traditional but I basically took an internship and managed to turn it into a a full-time role. I was lucky that my firm was growing.

\- From what I've seen, another path is to do exactly what it seems many people looking here are doing and taking relevant classes to land a role. That can be harder since economist jobs are rarer typically.

\- Another way is to get an advanced degree Masters/PhD and work for a think tank (Brookings, CBO etc) or a policy-oriented institution (IMF, Fed etc) and then transition into financial role. A lot of what I do is looking at what these institutions say so a way to make yourself stand out is to come from a place like that.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3. Am I happy is it rewarding?

\- Yes. I feel lucky that at times my job is getting paid to read the news and to sound smart. Work/life balance is typically better than other roles.

&amp;#x200B;

\#4. Are there downsides?

&amp;#x200B;

For sure. On the buyside, the big money is in investments and sales so economics isn't necessarily a priority. On the sellside, being an analyst can be grueling work and your compensation is usually based on how well your clients and sales team like you rather than how accurate your forecasts are. Having a point of view, being able to articulate and defend it are really key traits for this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#5. What skills are helpful

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would shape the type of classes you would take. The goal would be to write something like this.

For the econ part, if you're a college student and can tell me the effects of quantitative easing on asset prices and the real economy and how its different in the US, Europe, Japan that's pretty good.

For the analysis, excel skills with Bloomberg and Python would be good. Basically making insights with lots of data.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, \*all this can be learned from the job\* so I would prioritize passion and ability to learn as things to demonstrate.

&amp;#x200B;

So what makes this answer particularly hoax-y is that half the information is entirely factually correct, and as you can now see I've edited a number of citations where you can actually find the information I included. Firstly, to go through the bibliography:

But onto the main points. 

The introductory paragraph is half true. Perdue (who is cited in the corrected citation) does indeed highlight similarities in Qing policy between its treatment of affairs in Xinjiang and on the coast during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but the point about Anglo-Kokandi links is pure bullshit.

The point about rhubarb is very muddled. For a time, rhubarb was both highly expensive and seen as a bit of a wonder drug in Europe (one of Marco Polo's high priorities was seeking out the regions where it grew) but by the time of the Opium War it was already cultivated in Europe. And yes, it is a laxative.

All but the last sentence of paragraph 2 is completely true. Chinese medical treatises insisted that people in other countries had diets that would cause them to die of constipation unless they regularly consumed rhubarb, and so when the Qing embargoed Russia or Kokand they would regularly cut down rhubarb quotas at other trade posts and crack down on rhubarb smugglers.

While Jāhangīr's revolt and the Kokandi invasion did happen, these were unrelated to rhubarb. Ditto for James Flint, Lord Macartney and Lord Amherst, who all travelled to Beijing in 1757, 1793 and 1816 respectively, but of course rhubarb was not their priority.

Coleridge didn't spark people's interest in Central Asia, but Manning did travel to Lhasa in 1811 and get expelled by a Manchu official who had previously been at Canton – see Platt, *Imperial Twilight*, for a brief narrative of the journey and how it fit into the Anglo-Chinese interaction before the Opium War broke out. Morris Robertson is a deliberate muddling of Manning's contemporary, the missionary Robert Morrison, whose son John Robert Morrison produced the first translation of a Protestant Bible into Chinese. Staunton and Wellington had indeed worked to defuse situations before 1839, but obviously not for rhubarb; Jardine and Macaulay did stir up trouble in 1839, and the reasoning I give isn't far off: Jardine was an opium smuggler, Macaulay was a racist. However, the key thing in 1839 was that the outrage over Lin Zexu's unprecedentedly violent handling of the merchants *in and of itself* caused sufficient uproar for even Staunton and Wellington to change tack. Not rhubarb. And the point about the similarities in the 1835 and 1842 treaties is one that is actually widely academically accepted, first iterated by Joseph Fletcher in Volume 10 of the *Cambridge History of China*, and since reiterated, among others, by Perdue (in di Cosmo 2009) and Millward (1998).

All the events of the epilogue – the Taiping War, Second Opium War, Tungan Revolt and Kokandi invasion – did happen at the times I said they did, but obviously an Anglo-Kokandi conspiracy did not exist, and in fact travellers were quite common: a large number of our sources for things going on in Kashgaria come from British observers.",True,False,False,,0,1554170357,,False,0,{},ejx49yu,False,t3_b7pwnk,False,True,t1_ejtf2s2,/r/AskHistorians/comments/b7pwnk/why_did_the_first_opium_war_happen/ejx49yu/,False,,1557249565,3,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0.0,

You will be fine, if you only pay via credit card or Paypal, but if you like to pay with a method, where you pay in cash you will have to pay procession fees on top of the price everytime (between 6-8%). Steam has these fees included in the 30% cut just like nearly every other store in the world, so the customer doesn't have to pay these. And Valve also knows that people in Eastern Europe and Asia love to pay with cash methods (wallet cards for example), so they also subsidize (idk if that word is the most accurate one) those things out of their own pocket so the customers can pay equally, so they will get 50$ for 50$.

I think though that doing something like a USA-Mexico open border policy would be difficult given the current political climate and the fact that Mexico would need to get its own affairs in order first.

Conversely, a lot of immigration restrictions were done on racist thought and not much else. Such as:

* The [Page Act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875) and [Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act), which was a reaction to Chinese immigrants coming to the US during the gold rush. This was followed up with the [Geary Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary_Act). 
*  The [Immigration Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1917) and [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924), which again was done only for the purpose of restricting certain groups of people with no real valid reason. This was particularly devastating to those in Eastern Europe. The [quota](http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5078) for immigrants coming from Italy went from 200,000 a year to barely 4,000. The reason this didn't strain relations with Europe was due to the Great Depression, which made immigration less desirable.

It wasn't until the [Immigration Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965) that nation based quotas were abolished. The first form of amnesty came under the Reagan administration that was the [Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986) which granted amnesty to a few million illegal immigrants.

When kids move out of Armenia and go to the West (US/EU etc.) their views change. in the west, the military is seen as a career/job not a mandatory duty that every men must complete. 

Also these kids grow up with western benefits, better schooling and an opportunity for better job so it doesnt make sense for them to go to Armenia, spend 2 years busting their ass, risk getting killed by bullshit Azeris, fall back on school, work and social life.

Imagine a 2 year old kid who migrated to say Germany with his parents. When this kid (whose lived in Germany for 15 years) turns 18 you tell him that he has to give up his life in Germany and go spend 2 years serving in a conflict zone obviously he would rather stay in Germany. By the time this kid reaches the age of 27 there is no reason for him to move back and preeminently reside in Armenia other than because he was born there. 

Its also important to note that not only diasporans tried to avoid military service but mainland folks did as well. Especially during the previous gov. regime. The previous corrupt regime stole and plundered the armies supplies and they abused soldiers. Soldiers werent given proper uniforms, weapons or fed nutritious meals. 

Luckily after the revolution this is changing. Funds designated for the military are being properly spent on the military, corruption is being uprooted and soldiers are reporting that service conditions are much better. hopefully as more progress is made towards solving the NK conflict serving in the military will become less dangerous.

Any immediate future referendums on the matter must supplement, not undo, the result of the first, at least not for a considerable amount of time, a minimum of ten years usually. (see Quebec 1980 and 1995 referendum).

In my view, Brexit must be done in stages: Move to the EFTA as a temporary, develop an FTA with the EU that is mutually acceptable, then leave to ensure an orderly exit. That is one possible option, the other being no deal/WTO rules.

In brands that use continental EU sizing such as Chantelle, Simone Perele, Anita, Ulla Dessous, Gaia, Gorsenia, Triumph, etc the answer is yes, DDD is  the same as F. 

In brands that use UK sizing like Curvy Kate, Freya, Fantasie, Panache, Cleo, etc the answer is that UK-F is one cupsize larger than DDD or UK-E.  

In US sizing it also depends upon the brand. In standard US sizing (Wacoal, Goddess, Elila) F=DDD. In Torrid and Lane Bryant F is one cupsize larger than DDD. 

If you are shopping online in the USA, amazon. 

For in-store options look for independent boutiques or try Nordstrom or  Dillards.

In 2012 they blended some single casks of both malt and grain whisky and left them to marry and age for an additional 4 years.  Bottled in 2016 after a total maturation of 23 years.  Bottled at cask strength, 51.6% ABV.  Non-chill filtered and no added color.

&amp;nbsp;



**Nose:**  Nails it on the nose.  Vanilla.  Cream.  Powdered sugar.  Pudding.  Blackberries.  Strawberries.  Apples.  A bit of earth and just a hint of fish sauce.  Peanuts.  Herbs.

**Palate:**  Medium rich and creamy mouthfeel.  Loads of vanilla.  Custard.  Flan.  Apples.  Pears.  Apricots.

**Finish:**  Medium finish.  Still some sweetness and vanilla.  And a bit of apple as well.  But some spice and earth now too.  And herbs.  A bit of mint.  Some baking spices.  And marjoram.

**Score:** 90/100

&amp;nbsp;

This is really good.  More vanilla than just about any whisky I've ever tried, which is neat.  And creamy and light.  But not really very light.  Its a serious whisky.  Just a more classic one.  Not overpowering, not bombastic.  But delicious.  And well crafted, well balanced.  I'd love to drink this regularly.  And for the price they sell it for, I certainly would if I lived in Europe.  This was from a bottle split from a friend who had it shipped from Germany from one of his friends.  As far as I can tell, you can only buy it from the Cadenhead store directly.  Lucky for those who can go there easily, but for me, its a more rarefied treat.  I'll happily enjoy the rest of this bottle.

First of all you should know that PhD positions in the STEM fields Germany are almost always funded (and the theoretical self-sponsored option does not apply to foreigners). The formal application procedure starts with the PI posting the job (which is usually for a specific project) on their university's website and sometimes on job portals like Zeit online or academicpositions.eu. There's usually no such thing as the PI simply ""having funding"" and giving that money to you for your project. 

So, if you're looking for a PhD position in Germany, the first thing you should do is (continuously) keeping an eye on the job portals and applying for the positions you are interested in. 

The second thing you should do is, as you've already figured out, contact the PIs directly, as they can give you a lot more information, such as whether or not they are going to have open positions soon, or if they ""might"" have something soon. When you contact a PI, assume that you'll be working on a specific project of their own making, not your research idea, because that's how third-party-funding works. Reading some of their research before you contact them is usually a good idea. But you'll do that anyway -- how would you know whom to contact otherwise? So, after you've come up with a few PIs to contact, send them a short (1/2 A4) page e-mail stating who you are, what you've been doing, your interest in joining their group and a general research direction (not a specific project), inquire about whether there currently are or will be any opportunities for a new PhD student in the near future and attach your CV. 

The third thing you should do -- there are a lot of fellowships in Germany, so if a group that you're interested in doesn't have any immediate opportunities, you might be able to come to Germany with a fellowship, at least for a year or so. There's a database for international students that you should check out: https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?status=4&amp;origin=44&amp;subjectGrps=&amp;daad=&amp;q=&amp;page=1&amp;back=1 You should check if there are any that would be suitable for you. Of course one year is not enough to do a PhD, and this kind of funding is only temporary, but it would give the PI time to cook some funding, which means they would usually write a proposal for funds to continue the project after the fellowship runs out. Also in this case you should expect that the PI will make some suggestion and expect you to follow that suggestion.

[Finland has found the answer to homelessness. It couldn’t be simpler](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/finland-homelessness-rough-sleepers-britain)





&gt;**It turns out its solution is painfully simple and blindingly obvious: give homes to homeless people**. As Juha Kaakinen, who has led much of the work on “housing first” in Finland, explained to me when I met him in Helsinki, “this takes housing as a basic human right” rather than being conditional on engaging in services for addictions or mental health. 



&gt;This is fundamentally different to our model in the UK, where stable accommodation is only provided as a “reward” for engaging in treatment services. The problem with this is obvious if you stop and think about it: how do we expect people to address complex personal problems while exposed to the chaos of life on the streets?

&gt;Sceptics will argue that giving homes to homeless people is a recipe for disaster. **Aren’t we just subsidising addiction? Won’t we end up with huge bills when it all goes wrong? Don’t people need an incentive to get their lives back on track and engage in services?**

&gt;**Actually, no**. The evidence from Finland – as well as numerous other pilot schemes across the world – shows the opposite is true. 



&gt;When people are given homes:


&gt; - **homelessness is radically reduced**, 


&gt; - **engagement in support services goes up** and 



&gt; - **recovery rates from addiction are comparable to a “treatment first” approach** 



&gt; - Even more impressive is that there are **overall savings for government, as people’s use of emergency health services and the criminal justice system is lessened.**




&gt;**It turns out its solution is painfully simple and blindingly obvious: give homes to homeless people**




[How social housing can save the American city](https://theweek.com/articles/786944/how-social-housing-save-american-city)


&gt;**But what rent control does not do is provide a supply of new units. That's where social housing comes in.** This refers to government-owned housing that is open to all residents (contrary to American-style public housing, which is restricted to the poor). **This provides the needed housing supply, and in all market segments simultaneously — not just the luxury market**. Without the need for profit, overall rents could be lower — but with broad socioeconomic diversity among tenants, governments could still use ""social rents"" to pay for upkeep (no huge subsidies required) and cross-subsidize their tenants.




[Why America Needs More Social Housing](http://prospect.org/article/why-america-needs-more-social-housing)


&gt;**AMERICAN VISITORS TO Vienna are typically struck by the absence of homeless people on the streets.** And if they ventured around the city, they’d discover that there are no neighborhoods comparable to the distressed ghettos in America’s cities, where high concentrations of poor people live in areas characterized by high levels of crime, inadequate public services, and a paucity of grocery stores, banks, and other retail outlets.

&gt;Since the 1920s, **Vienna has made large investments in social housing** owned or financed by the government. But **unlike public housing in the United States, Vienna’s social housing serves the middle class as well as the poor, and has thus avoided the stigma of being either vertical ghettos or housing of last resort**. Every country in Western Europe has some version of social housing, but Vienna’s is by far the largest and most successful. It is typically ranked as one of the world’s most livable cities.

&gt;the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of a population, and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population.

The report points out that

&gt;the most likely changes in fertility and mortality rates for Europe and Japan are unlikely to counter population decline and population ageing over the next half century.

Given this scenario, the report explains that

&gt;Replacement migration was one among a number of possible policy responses that were considered.

The report further raises two salient points:

&gt;While orderly international migration can provide countries of origin with remittances and facilitate the transfer of skills and technology, it also may entail the loss of needed human resources. Similarly, international migration can provide countries of destination with needed human resources and talent, but may also give rise to social tensions.

The full title of the report is *Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations.* It's a briefing that was developed to help policy-makers understand a specific set of issues. There is no ""plan"" in the report - there aren't even any specific recommendations.

The report was discussed at an [Expert Group Meeting on Policy Responses to Population Ageing and Population Decline](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/expert-group/2/index.asp), and it's worth reading the responses to the report. The UK response from David Coleman questioned the demographic projects and recommended the UN Population Division widens the discussion beyond migration; the Russian response from Anatoly Vishnevsky accepted the projections but referred to the choice between decline and immigration as a choice between ""the lesser of two evils""; the EU response from Fotakis pointed out that

&gt;Different policy mixes can be considered in an effort to maintain the high welfare standards of the EU social models without harm neither for the European society nor for the developing countries. Besides, rapid and radical policy changes to either direction might imply increased transition costs and unpredictable social implications... assessing the needs of immigration for the European Union is a quite complicated issue that cannot be treated by taking only into account the demographic trends.

Almost all of the responses emphasized that an exclusive focus on migration as a solution was probably counter-productive, and that a broader range of policy issues needed to be explored in order to really address the two challenges of population ageing and population decline. And that was where the discussion ended.

D'après ce sondage, l'immigration arrive en tête des réponses les plus souvent données (23 % des réponses) à l'échelle de l'Europe.

Dans certains pays, les questions de pouvoir d'achat, de santé, de corruption ou de chômage sont jugées plus importantes.

Une tendance fidèle au dernier Eurobaromètre publié au mois de février pour le compte du Parlement européen.

&gt;En Europe de l'Est (Pologne, Slovaquie, Roumanie), la question migratoire arrive loin derrière les problématiques de santé et de corruption. Même chose en Hongrie, où le président nationaliste Viktor Orbàn multiplie pourtant les sorties contre les migrants. 

&gt;En Grèce et en Espagne, deux pays durement touchés par la crise économique et les mesures d'austérité, c'est le chômage qui arrive en tête des préoccupations. En Italie, c'est aussi la réponse qui est la plus souvent donnée, mais la peur de l'immigration y est plus présente (32 % des réponses). 

&gt;En revanche, en Allemagne, en Autriche ou en Belgique, l'immigration est le problème n°1 pour les personnes interrogées.
