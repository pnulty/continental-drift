The thread you're replying on is in response to **English is an ethnicity, off course colour is relevant**

Why are you defending that person's statement if colour isn't relevant?

May I also direct your attention to *England was created by Europeans. So was Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Separate ethnicity from citizenship. Citizenship has no colour but ethnicity does. So technically anyone can be an English citizen but not ethnically English (European), unless you believe in trans-racialism.*

Both of those statements are the one you've jumped in on. I'm using that guys definition of English where ethnicity is an issue of colour.

&gt;I would not consider Celts, Welsh, Picts, Vikings, Brythons, Romans and Gauls to be English, and those are all white and European and in Britain. What is English is not defined by that. England is not a physical territory but a mutual alliance and political compromise of west germanic tribes. That is what defines it and is the historical reason for the grouping.

Enforced persecution =/= natural decline. What's happening today is completely different to what happened back then.

The secularization thesis states this: once a religion spreads throughout a particular area/nation and becomes dominant there, it eventually plateaus and declines in favor of secularization. As long as the decline is not *forced* (i.e. no persecution), it inevitably declines on it's own and never returns. This is what Christianity faces in developed western and european nations today. In fact it applies to all religions.

&gt; The weekend negotiations between US President Donald Trump and China&amp;#039;s Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Osaka, have been portrayed in some quarters as a breakthrough in the trade war.

&gt; Given the recent trends in global output and trade, the Fed may have no alternative, particularly since the European Central Bank has indicated the sudden deterioration has forced it to abort plans to end its stimulus program.

&gt; The third prong in Mr Trump&amp;#039;s China attack involves the banking system.

&gt; John Robert ""Joe"" Cocker OBE (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English rock/blues singer who came to popularity in the 1960s, most known for his gritty voice and his cover versions of popular songs, particularly those of The Beatles.

&gt; Joe Cocker was the youngest son of a civil servant. From 1961 Cocker was by day an apprentice gas fitter and by night, in dark suit and bow tie, he became Vance Arnold singing with The Avengers in rough Sheffield pubs. The set included songs by mentor Ray Charles ""What'd I Say"" and ""Georgia on My Mind."" Vance Arnold and the Avengers biggest moment came in 1963 when they supported The Rolling Stones at Sheffield City Hall, and brought the house down.

&gt; In 1962 Cocker left the Gas Board and released his first single, a cover of The Beatles ""I'll Cry Instead."" His band, Joe Cocker Big Blues, built up a large following in the north of England and ventured to France for a two month stint, playing on American airbases.

&gt; The servicemen, many from America's deep south, loved Joe. The French called him ""Le Petit Ray Charles"". Unfortunately when he returned home to England the bottom had fallen out of the local scene. Joe Cocker Big Blues folded.

&gt; For an entire year Joe never did a gig. Then along came the man Joe has called the greatest musician in the world, Chris Stainton. With Chris The Grease Band was formed.

&gt; Songs were written. Soon a demo found its way to Denny Cordell, the producer of The Moody Blues, Georgie Fame, and Procol Harum. Cordell liked what he heard of Joe, and soon set him up in London with a residency at The Marquee.

&gt; America loved Cocker from his first television appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1969. The Press seized upon him. Life Magazine called Joe ""The voice of all those blind criers and crazy beggars and maimed men who summon up a strength we'll never know to bawl out their souls in the streets.""

&gt; However, Cocker wasn't singing in the streets. He was singing at all the major rock festivals of that summer, culminating in the filmed triumph of Woodstock before half a million people (a phenomenal rip-roaring testimony to Joe Cocker in his absolute prime).

&gt; Of the ensuing ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" Cocker said: ""my thoughts were off to Venus, heading for outer space."" Along with Leon Russell and a menagerie of musicians, managers, roadies, wives, girlfriends, hangers on, children, a spotted dog plus a film crew, Joe played forty-eight cities in fifty-six days, to rapturous receptions everywhere.

&gt; The tour left Cocker battered, exhausted, and far from Venus. He ended up, per his own words, ""in a heap in Los Angeles, very disillusioned with the rock business."" 

&gt; In 1970, Cocker sold $3 million worth of records in America alone. His first three albums went platinum and Playboy voted him number one vocalist in their annual jazz and rock poll.

&gt; Cocker continued making albums and songs like ""Guilty"", ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" and ""You Are So Beautiful."" Songs that have become Cocker classics, all dating from the darkest days, back in the mid 1970's.

&gt; As the 80's dawned Cocker was invited by The Crusaders to join them on a song they had written exclusively for him - ""I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today."" The lyrics said it all and Joe received a standing ovation when he sang the song at the Grammy Awards in February of 1982. His duet with Jennifer Warnes on ""Up Where We Belong"", the theme from ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" brought an appearance at the Oscars ceremony in February 1983 and a hit worldwide, including Joe's first American number one.

&gt; From that point on, Cocker went from strength to strength, aided undoubtedly by the love and support of his wife, Pam, who he married in 1987. His Capitol albums from ""Civilized Man"" onwards have been tremendously successful. ""Cocker"", ""Unchain My Heart"" and ""One Night of Sin"" all turned platinum, (the latter also delivering Joe's most recent US top ten song ""When the Night Comes,"" written by Bryan Adams). Joe's album ""Night Calls"", the title single penned by Jeff Lynne, turned gold and headed towards platinum all across Europe within weeks of its release in Autumn '91.

&gt; Cocker recorded theme songs for movies ""9½ Weeks"", ""Harry and The Hendersons,"" ""Bull Durham,"" and ""An Innocent Man."" In 1991 Joe recorded ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" on the Elton John/Bernie Taupin tribute ""Two Rooms,"" which has sold over 3 Million copies worldwide.

&gt; Joe toured extensively and to great acclaim, not the least in Europe where he enjoyed a massive following. There were awards and accolades galore.Among many prestigious shows, he played for British royalty at a ""Prince's Trust Gala,"" ""Nelson Mandela's Birthday Concert,"" the ""Konzert for Berlin"" that celebrated the breaching of the Wall and, in his adopted homeland of America, the inauguration ceremony for President George Bush.

&gt; Joe Cocker ws a survivor, a star and a rock legend. He had hit records in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. Success brought with it a grueling schedule of recording and touring but, after more than twenty-five years on the road he kept going until the end

&gt; On 22 December 2014, Cocker died of lung cancer at his home in Colorado at the age of 70. Read more on Last.fm.

Lol yeah ofc it's a concern for you.  Because you're convinced it's totally natural and innate and totally not something we invented as a societal convention.  It's also not really easy to tell someone's race through their DNA.  If I find a bunch of SNPs that correlate with Western Europe...pretty easy to guess you're white.  But in the 1800's, that same person would not have been classified as white.  And even today, some people in Europe will not consider you white if you're of certain minority groups e.g. Jewish.

Again, race is a societal convention.  I would love for you to take an online course in this.  Every university is on EdX or Coursera at this point offering free knowledge.  Go out there and listen to a Sociology 101 or even Genetics course to understand this stuff.

\&gt; Inadequate because by the standards of gender expression everyone can identify as a man and if everyone is a man then what does the word man actually mean.

Ding ding ding.  You just discovered why gender is a societal construct.  The word ""man"" doesn't really mean anything except for all of the societal baggage we collectively attach to it (e.g. stoicism, manual labor, smoking, etc.).

But others don't for understandable reasons (they see themselves more as women, or as something else entirely).  And that too is their right, and totally fine.

You think these attacks are creating a system that discriminated against you for being a man (gender) and white (race/color)?

History time:

Many blacks never got their 40 acres and a mule. Slavery. Jim Crow laws of the South. Even Democrat Kampala Harris talked about how difficult desegregation was in LA during the 1970’s during the recent 2020 presidential democratic debate. 

Various Native Americans fought for Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 later to be forced by him as president on the Trail of Tears in 1830. The 1819 NA civilization act. 

In 1924, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, giving Native Americans a ‘dual citizenship’ – they were citizens of their sovereign native land as well as the United States. Native Americans gained uniform voting rights in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But it wasn’t until 1968, when the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed, that Natives gained the right to free speech, the right to a jury and protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

Shoots 90% of Native Americans were wiped out by early European diseases. As Chris Rock jokes - when is the last time you saw a Native American family in Red Lobster? At least black people are alive and together. Our Native brothers and sisters were wiped out. 

The Chinese were always hated on - there’s a Canadian commercial that states for every mile of railroad a Chinese life was lost. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. 

The 1924 Immigration act banning all Asian immigration (sounds like Trumps Muslim travel ban huh?) and limiting immigration from racially inferior” eastern and Southern Europe to 2% of the US population from X country. The law was not modified to aid the flight of Jewish refugees in the 1930s or 1940s despite the rise of Nazi Germany. This lasted until 1952 w/ special exception to Filipinos since the USA bought Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines for $20 Mil (at the time) in 1898 form the Spanish. 

Forced internment of Japanese Americans during WW2 (one of the few groups to actually get reparations by Bush). 

Black Americans had to fight for their bloody civil rights in 1965 while free white men were guaranteed US citizenship if they’ve lived in the US for 2 years by the racist 1790 Naturalization act (excluded women and all minorities). Talk about a head start in generational wealth building. 

Federal Housing Administration’s racist redlining in 1934’s National Housing Act that heavily discriminated against blacks. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to fight this practice. 

https://centerforhealthprogress.org/blog/the-racism-of-us-immigration-policy/

I could go on. The point is this - Hitler as an individual could not bear the sum total of the negative karma of his actions. The whole country of Germany had to bear that burden and still do. Talk about white guilt - Germans had to accept and apologize for Hitler for decades even if they all didn’t want to because they lost WW2 and where at gunpoint. 

Same with you as a white man. 

It’s not cool to get attacked regardless of your color. I agree with you there.  United we stand, divided we fall. Follow the money to see who divides us. Only 100 Southerners owned more than 5 slaves antebellum. Most Southerners couldn’t afford that “social status symbol.” And yet the whole confederacy had to bear that moral burden especially after losing the Civil War. 

You do have white privilege. It is systematic and has been codified into law from the beginning of our great (and many times hypocritical) nation. 

You think you work hard? Look at a black working class man. You’d only know if you walk in his shoes though. 

What can you do?

Increase the awareness of how the system is set up for you (example - grocery stores have one ethnic food aisle and the rest are normally products for white people in the USA). 

Learn to talk about race in a calm and educated manner. Have the courage, empathy and strength to support equality for all. No need to spend your life apologizing. Do something.

And my views about the inequality between men and women are justified by the statistics. More than 40% of American couples now meet online and the rate of increase for this method of dating is greater than any other method has previously been. This makes the claim that the inequality that exists in online dating is representative of dating as a whole, have more validity.

&gt; https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/

A bit of a summary here:

regarding online dating there’s actually a huge inequality between both sexes as calculated by economists. To summarize, they use the no of likes a profile online receives as the dating economy. From this they calculate the Gini coefficient which is a measure of inequality from 0 to 1.  “An egalitarian group in which each individual has the same income would have a Gini coefficient of zero, while an unequal group in which one individual had all the income and the rest had none would have a Gini coefficient close to one. When Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett walks into a room, the Gini coefficient of the room shoots up. 

heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing”

On a list of 149 countries’ Gini indices provided by the CIA World Factbook, this would place the female dating economy as 75th most unequal (average—think Western Europe) and the male dating economy as the 8th most unequal (kleptocracy, apartheid, perpetual civil war—think South Africa)”.

BY NO MEANS AM I BLAMING WOMEN FOR THIS PHENOMENON. It’s just how biology uses hypergamy to maximize the number of offspring whilst utilizing the best genetics in a tribe. It’s just a more viable method for a species’ survival

The emergence of online dating has enhanced the accessibility to a wider pool of potential partners. Female behaviour is naturally hypergamous, seeking the best mate she can regardless of her own ‘market value’ to put it in a very crude way.  And this is why the older short fat man telling incels that he made it in his time so we have no excuse not to, is invalid as today’s dating environment is radically different to one before the emergence of online dating.",True,False,False,,0,1561956169,,1561956518,0,{},esgkvly,False,t3_c75uz0,False,True,t1_esfuffp,/r/tall/comments/c75uz0/any_other_tall_girls_get_irritated_when_one_of/esgkvly/,False,,1571181892,1,True,[],False,tall,t5_2qv8g,r/tall,public,0,

&gt; The study doesn&amp;#039;t offer any criticisms of Trump, but it comes amid continued chaffing by security hawks in both parties who have objected to the president&amp;#039;s repeated slights at U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia, public affection for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, and his habit of scoffing at the evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia is attacking Western institutions in ways more shrewd and strategically discreet than many realize,&amp;quot; said Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, an anti-Putin Washington think tank that recently completed its own study of Russian efforts to undermine the West.

&gt; The Pentagon paper, which has not been widely disseminated, assesses Russia&amp;#039;s intentions in an attempt to understand what drives its strategy, outlines a range of malign activities attributed to Russia in regions as diverse as Africa and the Arctic and lays out ways the United States could strengthen its response.

The short of it is, it's really hard to look at an [audio waveform](https://cloudinary-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_770/dpr_3.0,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/waveform_post.png) and be like ""oh, yeah, I know exactly what's happening!"" Okay, maybe you could figure out all you need with a single sine wave - but very few things in nature *are* single sine waves*.

It's far more useful to figure out what frequencies are in a signal, and to what extent. The waveform I posted above is known as a time-domain signal, because it shows amplitude (vertical axis) as a function of time (horizontal axis). We're not so interested in the microsecond-to-microsecond of the signal (most of the time) - we want to know what the signal kind of does as a whole.

Enter the Fourier transform, and variants thereof (i.e. FFT vs DFT, whose acronyms aren't important for the purposes of this post). What the Fourier transform does is essentially extract frequency data from the time signal and mathematically transforming the graph in such a way that frequency is now on the horizontal axis. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guru_Moorthy6/post/how_to_convert_time_domain_data_into_frequency_domain_data/attachment/5ab5e8ea4cde266d5893734a/AS%3A607584901926912%401521870937728/image/conversion.png) is how a time-domain graph might be transformed into a frequency-domain graph. [This](http://www.radartutorial.eu/10.processing/pic/Time_vs_Frequency_domain.print.jpg) is an excellent image showing how you can think of time and frequency domains to be two different axes of the same plane, with amplitude being the common vertical axis.

So why is this relevant? Well, a gunshot is relatively instantaneous - it goes from 0 amplitude to a lot of amplitude instantly (at least, that's what it sounds like to us). In order to move a signal from 0 to high (like a binary signal or a square wave), you need a lot of high frequencies superimposed on top of each other. If you put the sound wave of a gunshot through a spectral analyzer (basically, if you perform a Fourier transform on a gunshot), I'd bet that there would be a lot of high frequencies. If you analyze a sound file with a lot of regular gunfire (i.e., machine gun fire), you'd get a better result (since FFTs are more accurate with longer times), plus a spike at 600 or 800 or 1000, which would correspond to the cyclic rate of the weapon.

&gt;   Cruzar la grieta. Algunos peronistas que vieron cómo avanzaban sobre su partido las ideas de Cristina, expresadas por La Cámpora, sintieron que tenían que optar. Foto: Casa RosadaHace más de 320 millones de años aparecieron l[os primeros mamíferos, los sinápsido](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/psicopatologias-del-poder.phtml)s. La vida se instalaba en nuevos sitios y estos reptiles se volvieron endotermos, regularon la temperatura de sus cuerpos y desarrollaron características mamalianas. Desarrollaron también un cerebro que les permitió sobrevivir en un medio que se volvió más hostil cuando, 90 millones de años después, aparecieron los dinosaurios y dominaron el mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; Hace unos 300 mil años aparecimos los Homo sapiens. N[uestro cerebro se había desarrollado a través de cientos](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/lo-que-dicen-las-encuestas.phtml) de millones de años y nos proporcionaba una información sofisticada que no pasaba por procesos racionales. Inventamos la escritura hace unos 5 mil años y con ella llegaron los dioses. Pero nuestra relación con el entorno pasa, ante todo, por la información que recoge nuestro cerebro. Así como percibíamos la cercanía de espacios peligrosos, cuando vamos a un barrio desconocido podemos también darnos cuenta de que existen peligros, no porque analicemos datos concretos, sino porque leemos inmediatamente los contextos y sabemos que pasa algo peligroso. **Pasa lo mismo con los electores que, antes de leer manifiestos o escuchar discursos, ven a un candidato y reaccionan inmediatamente ante la sensación de que es mentiroso.** Tomamos actitudes en la vida de acuerdo a ese conjunto de informaciones que para movernos en una u otra dirección no necesitan ordenarse de manera consciente.
&gt; 
&gt; **Reciente.** La democracia es una forma de organizar la lucha por el poder que tiene muy pocos años. Nació asociada a los cafetines, a los libelos, manifiestos y textos escritos. Mientras estuvo restringida a un sector pequeño de la población fue la democracia de los textos, de los discursos. El progreso tecnológico incorporó a la mayoría de la población al proceso y dio un nuevo espacio a las formas tradicionales de percibir la realidad. La palabra, los conceptos, la teoría, son indispensables para comprender de manera profunda los procesos, pero las masas se orientan más por la información que les proporciona su cerebro. Cuando nuestro ancestros se encontraban en la selva y veían que los matorrales se movían de determinada manera, percibían ciertos olores, integraban decenas de informaciones de todo tipo, se daban cuenta de que estaban ante un peligro y huían. No lo hacían por falta de información sino porque hacían uso de una gran cantidad de datos que articulaban en su cabeza de manera automática.
&gt; 
&gt; [Una bomba de tiempo](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/una-bomba-de-tiempo.phtml)
&gt; 
&gt; **Vivos y otros.** Al haberse extendido la democracia pasa algo semejante con los procesos electorales. Más allá de lo que digan algunos analistas, existen fenómenos que no tienen que ver tanto con las palabras y los manifiestos como con la percepción de la realidad que tienen amplios grupos humanos. Independientemente de lo que digan los discursos y las teorías, hay muchos argentinos que se identifican con una determinada forma de ver la realidad que tiene que ver con creencias, perspectivas de futuro, sueños de lo que querrían hacer y[remedios para sus insomnios.](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/numeros-de-los-candidatos.phtml)
&gt; 
&gt; Desde **hace años sabemos que el kirchnerismo tenía y tiene el favor de un enorme porcentaje de votante**s con percepciones semejantes que no van a cambiar porque les expliquen ciertas teorías o porque les cuenten determinados datos. Suponer que esto podría desaparecer persiguiendo a sus dirigentes o publicando la lista de sus equivocaciones o sus transgresiones a la ley es absurdo. No votan por Cristina porque desconocen que existen los cuadernos de Centeno. Lo saben e integran esa información en un conjunto simbólico en el que aparecen como pruebas de la persecución de los ricos a una dirigente popular. Tampoco desconocen los proyectos que quieren acabar con la Constitución y controlar todos los poderes para bien de su grupo.
&gt; 
&gt; En algún estudio que realizamos hace unos meses nos encontramos con que cerca del 75% de los argentinos admira más al avivado que al que cumple con todas las normas. No es algo único de nuestro país, sino que es una actitud frecuente en América Latina. Reiteradamente aludimos en esta columna al concepto de anomia que explica la actitud del enorme porcentaje de latinoamericanos que no tiene interés en cumplir con las normas, a las que consideran expresión del poder de los ricos. Prefieren vivir en sociedades controladas por un líder mesiánico que exprese sus pulsiones negativas enfrentando fantasmas inexistentes, con discursos patrióticos sin sentido desde un análisis racional. Aunque a algunos analistas no les guste y no entiendan la dinámica de estos grupos, existen y tienen una importancia enorme en todos nuestros países.
&gt; 
&gt; Por otra parte, hay un porcentaje importante de electores que percibe que el país puede ir a una nueva etapa en que vivirán mejor. Por un lado, tienen la información de siempre acerca de que Argentina es un país rico con enormes recursos naturales. Pero lo más importante es que se han incorporado al mundo de internet y la modernidad. Se informan acerca de que casi todos los países del mundo, incluida la China comunista, son capitalistas. Ven el enorme crecimiento de bienes y servicios propios de la sociedad contemporánea y quieren participar de esa prosperidad. Se alegran cuando saben que el Mercosur llega a un acuerdo con la Union Europea y que por esa vía sus productos tienen espacio en uno de los mercados más grandes del mundo. Ninguno de estos asuntos aislado explica sus actitudes. Es el conjunto de que además integra la libertad de prensa, la libertad de expresión y muchos aspectos básicos de la democracia occidental.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dos campos**. La oposición entre estos dos grandes grupos se fue consolidando en la medida en que Cristina Fernández dio un contenido más violento al primero y **Mauricio Macri** logró consolidar y dar sentido al segundo. Las demandas que se hicieron en su momento de que se amplíe la base política de gobierno, incluyendo a personajes políticos que denostaban a **Cristina Fernández**, no tuvo éxito y Macri conservó su identidad. Para la gente que se identifica con el cambio, si el Gobierno incluía a **Sergio Mass**a como jefe de Gabinete, a **Felipe Solá** como ministro del Interior y a Julio Bárbaro como ministro de Modernización, habría perdido todo su sentido.
&gt; 
&gt; Según avanzó el enfrentamiento electoral, la oposición entre democracia y populismo autoritario fue el eje de las elecciones. Algunos peronistas que vieron cómo avanzaban sobre su partido las ideas de Cristina expresadas por La Cámpora sintieron que tenían que optar. La división entre un discurso insurgente y el tradicional del peronismo expresada cuando el General expulsó de la Plaza de Mayo a la Tendencia cobró actualidad. Muchos peronistas conservan las ideas básicas de Perón en torno a la justicia social, pero son democráticos e institucionales. La presencia de **Miguel Angel Pichetto** dio a la fórmula de Macri ese aporte que aparece por primera vez en la política argentina: **peronista sí, totalitario no.**
&gt; 
&gt; La mayor parte de los disidentes de Cristina eran solamente personas que estaban dando una vuelta por el mundo antes de volver a la fuente original en la que nacieron como líderes políticos. De hecho, casi todos ocupan algún lugar en el cristinismo.
&gt; 
&gt; Estos son fenómenos políticos profundos que están en la sociedad. Se expresaron cuando **Mauricio Macri** ganó la presidencia a Scioli con una ventaja muy reducida y ahora, aunque todos los estudios coinciden en que sumadas las preferencias electorales de Mauricio y **Cristina Kirchner llegan a cerca del 80%.** Curiosamente, algunos analistas dijeron que alguien había inventado una grieta dividiendo a los argentinos entre estas dos opciones y que la mayoría está ansiosa de superar esta división. Si eso fuera cierto y la mayor parte de los argentinos quisiera superar esa contradicción, no se identificaría tan claramente con los dos principales grupos en conflicto. Por otra parte, para que se pueda superar la contradicción entre dos concepciones arraigadas de la política se necesitaría que exista una idea tan fuerte que pueda superar y ser una síntesis de las dos iniciales.

Democracy doesn't end at a referendum result. If you see your country heading in a direction you believe is terrible for it then you have the right to speak up and say it's a stupid idea, even if the majority disagree with you. 

This isn't about remain or leave or whatever. This is about those who proclaim to be the guardians of democracy such as yourself having no understanding of how a functioning democracy works. It works by having the argument and having it afterwords, reacting to facts and new events, allowing choice and allowing someone to change their mind.

1. You didn't have technology such as the canon AND

2. You have enough wealthy people inside to draw upon their resources and skills for both defending the city and for producing an effect where those laying seige would be convinced with a few bread crumbs thrown to them to negotiate. The reason there were walled cities around the Mediterranean was that the lifeblood of the economy was trade that relied upon slaves or near slaves to row the boats. Europe paid a price for that oppressive practice with the next 2000 years of war. These days, to think of walls as normal in protecting large areas is an idea which just shows someone has played too many video games.

Walls have never worked to defend national borders. I was an exchange student in West Berlin, decades ago. Erich Honecker, the East German leader, had mine fields, guards to shoot people on sight who were in the no go zone, and the Stasi to provide pressure on the families of the people who had escaped through the Iron Curtain. The Berlin Wall was a tiny part of a wide range of practices.

I think thats by far and large the most important factor in why European flags use these colours so much.

The red white and blue as used in the Dutch flag represented the people (red blood)) the church (white &amp; holy) and the nobility (blue blood). Which wasnt something to think lightly about. The people placed above the church and the nobility, no family dynasty crest/coat of arms on top of the tri-colours. Peter the Great did put a dynasty coat of arms on top of the colours and he placed the white (church) above the nobility (blue) and put the people below (red). Whether there were motivations of changing the positions of these colours i do not know, i am not even sure whether Peter the Great used the same meaning for each colour. Maybe a Russian can explain that below.

&gt;It’s one of the biggest bug-bears of middle-income earners, and an area that is likely to be a focus in the upcoming budget: Ireland still has one of the highest marginal rates of tax in the world.

&gt;Figures from the OECD for 2016 show that Ireland, with a top rate of 52 per cent, including USC and PRSI (55 per cent for the self-employed on earnings over €100,000) is one of only 15 out of 34 OECD countries with a marginal rate in the 50s. Even here, it has slipped out of the top 10, with its rate now the 14th highest on the back of changes in previous budgets.

&gt;Typically, the level of earnings at which it kicks in is €70,044. That’s broadly in line with countries such as Sweden (€66,997); Denmark (€64,453) and the Netherlands (€67,703).

&gt;However, people start paying just a slightly lower rate, or 49 per cent, at a much lower level of earnings. That means a greater proportion of people’s incomes may be taxed at this higher rate in Ireland, compared with other countries in the world.

On the one hand it sucks, on the other hand tax has to come from somewhere and Ireland has made the choice to offer relatively low corporate tax rates. This has to be made up from personal taxation. To look at it from the flip side, Ireland has some of the highest salary levels in Europe, and it arguably wouldn't have if it wasn't so business/FDI friendly with the corporate rate.

It’s not unusual for Vladimir Putin’s actions and statements to trigger a frosty reaction abroad. Theresa May’s facial expression at her photocall with the Russian leader last week spoke a thousand words. She disapproved intensely of the man she was shaking hands with and was determined to make this abundantly clear.

Mr Putin’s bold claim that western liberalism is now obsolete has met with a predictably hostile response. Both men seeking the leadership of the Conservative Party were swift to dismiss his analysis. Jeremy Hunt insisted that liberal values were responsible for generating more wealth and happiness than anywhere else in the world. Boris Johnson was adamant that history would prove the Russian president wrong.

Seeking to derive a coherent political philosophy from Mr Putin’s public pronouncements is no easy task. But on this occasion, he has raised an intriguing intellectual challenge and, tragically, he even may be on to something. “The liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done,” Mr Putin claimed. “It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.”

Of course, the observation mischaracterises liberalism. It is those who advocate anarchism who presuppose that nothing needs to be done. Liberals believe in strict limits on what can legitimately be done by state authorities. All liberals agree that there is some useful role for the state, but they fear growth in its power and scope.

The power of the Putin pronouncement is that those who purport to be the greatest defenders of limited state liberalism appear to be the prime architects of its continued, albeit gradual, erosion.


Any historical analysis of Theresa May’s three-year tenure in Downing Street will inevitably focus on her inability to finalise Brexit, but there is a plethora of intriguing side issues which, taken together, amount to a significant story in themselves. Increased state regulation over individual consumer choices and corporate activity has been relentless.

The list of completed and intended actions by the outgoing administration is too extensive to list here but include the prohibition on the use of cartoon characters in marketing cereals, a ban on advertising of various foods at certain times of day or in certain places, making “ageism” a hate crime, stopping children from buying energy drinks, increasing state control in the setting of electricity prices and obliging companies to report on differences in the remuneration of male and female staff.

On the other side of the ledger, it is hard to find significant examples of the May administration hacking away at state control and granting greater power to the private sector. I feel sure there must be some, but none spring to mind.

The oddity here is that, at the outset, Mrs May did not outline a manifesto of enhancing state regulatory power. She did express some concerns about aspects of corporate governance in Britain, but there was little else to suggest that her premiership would amount to a combination of increasing domestic red tape while failing to execute the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

The surprising, often petty, interventionism of the May administration does not prove Putin’s dictum that liberalism is obsolete, but it does underscore that the current default setting of the United Kingdom is to travel along a path of ever-increasing interventionism and ever less market liberalism. The picture in much of the western world is similar, with the possible, and significant, exception of Trump’s America.

The challenge, and the choice, for Britain’s next prime minister will be whether to continue eroding individual and corporate discretion or whether to chart another course. If they wish to do the latter, it will require a determined effort, not merely a few nods and tweets in the general direction of market freedom.

A frustrating feature of numerous speeches from the prime minister and the chancellor has been the issuing of a rallying cry that the case for free market capitalism needs to be made powerfully again, only to shrink from the task of actually making that case.

So dominant has the Brexit issue been in contemporary debate that it is difficult to discern the intentions of Mr Johnson or Mr Hunt in this wider area of their approach to policy. As is common in the heat of a campaign, both candidates are attempting to make pledges on tax reductions and state spending increases while continuing to prove they can broadly balance the books. But neither has laid out an extensive list of areas in which they wish to see current state powers diminished or abolished. Perhaps neither is committed to such a list at all and prefer a continuing drift towards greater regulation.

The challenge of Mr Putin’s observation is not that western liberalism can be rendered obsolete by a single, micro-level encroachment of the state. The government removing a cartoon tiger from a packet of frosted flakes might be irritating, but it doesn’t of itself herald the end of a liberal society. A little tampering here and a few bans there doesn’t bring the free market system to an immediate end.

However, one can embark on a journey of tempering markets and freedoms that leaves not a well-regulated liberal market, but something that is barely a market at all. That has been the pattern of the last few years. Unless the next prime minister can focus their administration at least as much on liberalising markets as regulating them, then Mr Putin will eventually be proven right. What would be left of free market liberalism would be an emasculated historical artefact, rather than the core guiding principle of our society.",True,False,False,,1,1561970411,,False,0,{},esgwdl1,True,t3_c7q3n3,False,True,t3_c7q3n3,/r/ukpolitics/comments/c7q3n3/could_banning_a_cartoon_tiger_symbolise_the/esgwdl1/,False,,1571187349,0,True,[],False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

Chopping off hands and obliging women to wear a headscarf is *exactly what Mohammed and the Koran said to do:*

* The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and Mohammed and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or **their hands and their feet be cut off** on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the hereafter. Koran 5:33

* I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. **Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.** Koran 8:12 

* And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and protect their private parts and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent and to **draw their veils all over *juyubihinna* [their bodies]** and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands. Koran 24:31

* Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to **draw their veils all over their bodies.** That will be better, that they should be known as respectable women so as not to be *yu'dhayna* [harmed or hurt]. Koran 33:59

Now how would a woman be ""harmed"" for not covering herself up? Abdullah Yusuf Ali, whose English translation of the Koran is one of the most widely used, translates *yu'dhayna* as ""molested,"" meaning a woman could bring sexual assault *on herself* if she is not covered up according to Islamic dictates.

In Sahih Bukhari 6:321, Mohammed said it's wrong for a woman to leave the house without a veil. 

In Abu Dawud 32:4092, Mohammed said that a woman's face and hands must be covered at puberty. 

In Abu Dawud 2:641, Mohammed said Allah does not accept prayers from an unveiled woman. 

In Sahih Muslim 26:5395, Mohammed told women to wear a burka, not just a headscarf. 

[""I say that when a girl walks about like that [without a veil] it is a patriotic duty to sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her.""](http://archive.is/Mcvhv) Quote from Nabih Wahsh, Muslim lawyer, on Egypt's al-Assema TV, October 19, 2017.

[""Either you wear a veil or you get raped.""](http://archive.is/OKDkH) Quote from one of the most prominent Islamic scholars in Europe, Tariq Ramadan. He said it to one of his own rape victims. 

What's that you were saying, Redouane Ahrouch, you fucking liar? 

In fact, there are several different forms of lying that are sacred to Muslims:

1) **Taqiyya** is saying something that isn't true as it relates to the Muslim identity. This is a Shiite term. The Sunni counterpart is *muda'rat.*

2) **Kitman** is lying by omission. 

3) **Tawriya**  is intentionally creating a false impression.

4) **Muruna** is ""blending in"" by setting aside some practices of Islam or Sharia in order to advance others.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably not the first time this topic has been posted but i weirdly feel strongly about this and wanted to voice my own thoughts on the subject.

I'm a 28 year old white male, living in Europe. I have no idea how it feels to be a person of any other color and i would never think i could ever imagine how it feels to be the victim of racism or living as a minority. But i'm not here to discuss racism as such or the extend of it - although i know it is far too wide spread and common (it shouldn't exist at all really).

I personally feel that the n-word should either be banned completely or be allowed to be used by anyone. I know for some (perhaps most) it is about the history of the word, how it was used as a derogatory name for centuries, or perhaps just the history of oppression in general. But that's part of my point - it is history (not neglecting the fact that racism is still an enormous problem at this time). Nowadays, pretty much every tweet made by a young black person talking about another person (white or black) will call them the n-word. ""What this n. doing lmaoo"" etc. Most black people i see/hear/know call each other the n-word.

I feel like its the only remaining thing that makes me feel a division, a disconnect between our cultures. A feeling that skin color actually makes you different in some way, since it determines how you greet each other and what you are allowed to say. If we are really one people, or at least strive to be. To really see past the color of your skin and only see a person for what they are: a person, a personality, should we then continue this tradition?

I know a lot of non-black (racist) people still use the word against black people - which i think is mostly down to the fact that they know it will trigger them and they want to be hurtful. Obviously that is very wrong and racist, i'm just hoping someday the culture will change, so we can either stop using the word all together, or all of us use the word in a friendly/greeting way - and even if used derogatively, it should be like calling someone an idiot or cunt or what ever.  
I know it hurts a lot more than to be called an idiot, but if we could somehow change that, then other races (mostly whites) wouldn't have 1 word to instantly hurt and trigger most black people.

For full disclosure i will add that me and my (white) friends sometimes call each other the n-word. I'm truthfully sorry if that offends anyone reading this. When we use the word, it is always as a replacement for ""mate"", ""buddy, ""bro"" etc.  
We only really use the word when chatting on discord when we game/chat with each other, and no black person is present. On the rare occasion we have played (and been on discord with) a black person without knowing this fact, and used the word, they have always (seemingly) been completely cool with it and mostly laughed at it - maybe because they could tell we didn't mean it in a negative way. This has only happened 5 times at most during several years.

I'm only adding this to be completely forthright, it might have an impact on my opinion - the sole fact that i use the word at all, since that makes me aware of my surroundings when used (although as i said, we would never use it in public), it is still in my vocabulary and sometimes naturally used to greet or address a friend).",True,False,False,,0,1561976883,,False,0,{},esh0jqk,False,t3_bswxvl,False,True,t3_bswxvl,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bswxvl/racism_megathread/esh0jqk/,False,,1571189391,3,True,[],False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,0,

Bride kidnapping, also known as bridenapping, marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, is a practice in which a man abducts the woman he wishes to marry. Bride kidnapping has been practiced around the world and throughout history. It continues to occur in countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus region, and parts of Africa, and among peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe.

In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime rather than a valid form of marriage.

If that's the case then I want England to leave the Union.  Forget Scotland.

What a bonkers argument.  We can't not implement anything because a minority don't want it.  Better not ban fox hunting because the country folk don't want it.  

Frankly, if the Scots can't accept that being in the Union will mean that they lose democratic votes then they should leave.

At least they get a vote though. We don't when it comes to what gets put up for EU law.

The mind blowing astonishingly bizarre contradiction here is that all the remainers support Scotland leaving.

*Even though all their arguments apply.*

* There can be no plan for how leaving is implemented until they have voted (eg the currency problem, the border - just use the NI solution lol)
* They are leaving an economically favourable position
* Leaving is massively expensive and complex
* Leaving will disrupt their lives for decades
* They will lose access to all the UK infrastructure and have no guarantee of joining the EU.  
* They are risking trade, job, revenue
* If they join the EU they will have to take the Euro and have the same risks that the small EU countries have.  Worked well for Greece, huh?  
*Fingers crossed Italy doesn't need the mother of all bailouts.  Amazing that some ""informed"" remainers don't appreciate how close the Euro was to going under in the 2008 financial meltdown.  


Somehow, all of these things are trivial for Scotland.  How rational of remainers.

It just makes no sense.  Unless it's just a childish response to losing.  That makes some sense as tragic as that is.  Let's pin the break up of the union on Brexit.  Fine.  Whatever.  I don't want it but it's their choice.

1. The end of their quest/search/journey (two times)
2. The end of Cylon resurrection/immortality (opening the way for true Cylon death)
3. The end of the human-cylon war (also two times)
4. The end of the cylon-civil-war
5. The end of the ""pure"" (Colonial) human race
6. The end of the ""pure"" (Colonial and 13th-tribe) Cylon races

This is the exact quote by the first-war Cylon hybrid:

""Kara Thrace will lead the human race to its end. She is the herald of the Apocalypse, the harbinger of death. They must not follow her.""

^(Here's a small contemporary blog analysis of that quote: https://ideas.4brad.com/cylon-god-and-his-prophecy)

The Rebel Basestar Cylon Hybrid also has a similar line:

""You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end. End of line.""

Note that the human race, as the colonial humans on the BSG fleet know it, does begin its ""end"" with its settlement on Earth^2.  They presumably breed and mix with:

1. The human-Cylon descendents of Helo and Athena (i.e. Hera and perhaps more)
2. The pre-existing primitive humans on Earth^2
3. Possibly other Colonial Cylon ""skinjobs""
4. Possibly other members of the ""Final Five"" (13th tribe Cylons)

This ""end"" could easily be interpreted as ""death"" - the ""death"" of the existing human race, but also as a ""rebirth"" into something new: a hybrid future.  There's a lot of symbolic parallels to this idea throughout the story:

1. Kara's death and rebirth
2. Roslin's death paving the way for a new future
3. The Galactica becoming a hybrid vessel
4. The alliance between humans and Cylons
5. Hera as the ultimate symbol of the hybrid future

A major part of Kara's story arc (highlighted in the episode where she dies), is the acceptance of death as something beautiful, and not to be feared.  Kara herself is a personification of this very concept of death and rebirth as something new, and perhaps better.  There are also similar themes echoed by other characters in the show: the idea that there is ""something beautiful between life and death"" (see D'Anna); the idea that parents need to die (death) before they can be replaced (reborn) by their children (the next iteration of a cycle that has all ""happened before""); etc. 

Finally, note that the source of the quote of Kara's destiny makes for an unreliable fortune teller.  This hybrid ""god"" was a member of a split-away faction of the original Cylons that (presumably) disagreed with the ""evolutionary path"" of the mainstream Cylons.  He had an inherent bias in seeking to maintain the ""purity"" of *his* line of Cylons and his own hybrid existence (which was described as a developmental dead end).  It seems quite obvious that he would view a different hybridization, and possibly ""corruption"" of the ""purity"" of the Cylon future in a more negative light.

I think the basestar hybrids are also similar evolutionary ""dead ends"" that would not be involved in the hybrid Cylon-human future that would develop on Earth^2.

I'd also point out that ""harbinger of death"" is itself quite ambiguous.  I could interpret it as simply being a title for Starbuck's role in the context of *having returned from the dead*.

&gt;It's like saying a prophecy that Christopher Columbus would lead humanity to it's destruction came true because the Spanish Empire doesn't exist anymore.

It's more like a prophecy foretelling the end of the Roman Empire, and then someone arguing that the Roman Empire lives on because European and American countries still owe so much to the linguistic, political, technological, and genetic influences of Roman.

No, you are. Considering you're talking about some kind of extreme right voting pattern, when our right wing parties have been decimated in the recent election, especially the nationalist Danish People's Party.

&gt;you are not talking to some dumb american who cant point denmark on a map

That is **exactly** what I am doing, judging by your comments.

&gt;for one there is a huge push for privatization and lowering taxes all over

Considering the fact that our right wing parties LOST the general election, that simply put, is a fucking lie. How dumb are you? Noone, **NOT A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY IN DENMARK** supports privatization of healthcare. It would instantly lead to 0% in all polls, as no Dane is dumb enough to want American healthcare when we have some of the best accessible healthcare in the world. Our right wing government has failed to lower taxes by any meaningful amount, and our new left wing government intends to raise them, **and was elected on that promise.**

&gt;again plenty of european countries will be a mini usa with garbage weather.

Denmark won't. As for the right wing rising in various impoverished shitholes in Eastern Europe - I literally couldn't care less. Scandinavia is the only part of the world that I would describe as being civilised. Pretty much everything else is a shithole, one way or another.

&gt;About denmark your ""left wingers"" are mirroring more and more of the alt right's talking points

No they're not. They've gone sensible on many immigration policies, but in all other aspects our left wing parties are just as left wing as they always have been. The idea that we should be feeding a bunch of migrants and refugees fleeing Americas imperialist wars is just dumb, and more and more left-wing parties are in agreement to this. Despite this, our new government has decided to take more refugees, although the numbers will still be low. In reality we should be sending them all to the USA, as well as leaving NATO and cutting all military ties with the US.

&gt;and that is why they won because danes wont vote for anyone who is not a racist

Jesus christ man, you must be one of those American ""liberals"" (which btw, is a really dumb term considering that you're not economically liberal at all), who wants to flood our nation with Islamic barbarians. Fuck off, SJW.

We don't have **a single** racist party in our parliament. The only racist party running for parliament, failed to be elected.

&gt;you have paludan as a legit politician with fans for fucks sake

And who didn't get elected, despite our extremely low election threshold. They failed, the far-right FAILED.

&gt;go brag to clueless americans bro, I know what is up in europe

No you don't, as I've just pointed out to you.

&gt;because you hate black and brown people that much

We prefer our own people, which is completely fair, considering that it was our own people who enabled us to be one of the best countries on the fucking planet, something that not a single african or middle eastern country has ever achieved, or even gotten close to achieving. We are simply superiour, not because of race, but because of culture, attitude and (the lack of) religion. And many Danes simply don't want people who are incompatible with our way of life, to be given access to this land of milk and honey - because they'll fucking poison it. Religion (and especially Islam) is a terrible, terrible thing.

So, tl;dr: We aren't moving to the right on any other issue than immigration (which, by the way, is the ONLY issue that we should be moving to the right on). Our left wing parties are stronger than ever, in part thanks to their more realistic stance on immigration. We are a homogeneous country, which is exclusively a benefit, and we wish to remain so. Multiculturalism is bad, Islam is bad, Denmark is good :)

While Pakistan didn't directly involve itself in the conflict, Pakistani military officers have nonetheless guided the Saudis throughout the war. What do you think Raheel Sharif is doing in Saudi Arabia? 

&gt;you can be sure Pak won't be getting involved in any conflict with Iran. 

Pakistan doesn't have to invade Iran. We could very well simply use proxies to target them in Iranian Balochistan 

&gt;doesn't hold much clout on the economic front either when it comes to Iran. 

Considering Iran is on the verge of being utterly destroyed by US sanctions, Pakistan being one of Iran's major neighbours does in fact have a great deal of influence. Why do you think Iran's been so interested in joining CPEC? 

&gt;Pakistans military cooperation with Saudi/Qatar/UAE pales into insignificance when you compare it to them and the US/Europe. Pakistans military does not have the sort of power projection capabilities that the US/Europe do. That said, are Pakistanis (including Pakistani origin individuals) embedded within/part of Saudi/Qatar/UAE armed forces, of course. But they would have still been there even if the Saudis/Qatar/UAE DIDN'T loan Pakistan &gt;$12 billion.

Pakistan's military cooperation paling in comparison to US/Europe doesn't mean it's irrelevant. In fact, you're completely ignoring the fact that US/Europe involvement is mostly tied to arms sales whilst Pakistan presence has to do more with military bases and officers directly training and assisting the Gulf Countries. 

Another thing you fail to consider is loyalty. The Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia, see loyalty when they see Pakistan because Pakistan's relations with the Saudis aren't solely tied to oil like it is with America and Europe. They've a much greater chance at actually developing a friendship with Pakistan than say.. with America or the EU (the latter which has already started ending military sales to Saudi Arabia due to civilian casualties in Yemen). Then to all of this, you add in Pakistan's nukes and it's a done deal

&gt;So again, Pakistan was loaned money for strategic reasons

It's hilarious how keep repeating strategic reasons but then fail to consider what it entails. What value do these ""strategic reasons"" except through one's military and economy? 

&gt;keep out of Irans sphere of influence

Keep out of Iran's sphere of influence? Pakistan within Iran's sphere? Lmao, are you okay? Might as well add in ""Pakistan should be out of Afghanistan's sphere"" 

&gt;and the Qataris

It's the same as earlier. Pakistan isn't within or even at risk of falling under Iran or Qatar's sphere of influence. Neither of those two countries are influential enough to push Pakistan into their spheres and with Qatar, I doubt if they've even got any ""sphere of influence"" outside of fringe proxy groups 

&gt;don't take sides in our issues with the UAE/Saudi and/or mediate on our behalf.

How can you say that when they signed onto the Tory austerity framework? I don't care if you say it was a less severe austerity. Austerity is still austerity.

Well it might be if I had actually said that.

&gt;Less tax coming in means less money to spend. Otherwise poor countries would just decide not to be poor any more.

Why are you going back to this again? You might not understand macroeconomics but that doesn't mean economists don't understand it. Austerity has been repeatedly discredited by economic research.

Dando eu o pontapé de saída, propunha ao SC jogarmos com o esquema base que ele utilizou com o Liverpool - 4x2x3x1. Laterais bem abertos e a subir, os médios mais recuados a arrastar o meio campo para a frente, os 3+1 da frente em trocas posicionais e a atacar a balizar. 

Para tal, investia prioritariamente num PL/Avançado (tipo Roger Guedes) e num novo extremo. Se sobrassem ainda alguns trocos e as jantaradas tivessem todas pagas, por fim, um guarda-redes. Daria algo como:

11 base:

Vaná (ou GR novo)

Alex Telles; Pepe; Diogo Leite/Diogo Queiróz; Saravia

Danilo; Sérgio Oliveira

Extremo; Oliver; Corona;

Avançado.

O resto:

12.Diogo Costa (taças)

13.Manafá - lateral para os dois lados;

14.Diogo Leite/Diogo Queiroz - 3º Central

15.Mbemba - 4º Central

16.Loum - rodar os médios defensivos;

17.Otávio - possibilidade de alterar o esquema jogando como extremo/médio central

18.Galeno - 1ª substituição no jogo para extremo

19.Aboubakar - avançado para quando fosse necessário jogos muito fisicos (há sempre aqueles campos fdds em janeiro/fevereriro com muita chuva)

20.Terceiro avançado.

Geria os ""miúdos"" como o Jesualdo referiu: treinar periodicamente com o plantel, tentar que fossem para o banco na taça da liga e quipa B. Teria o Tomás Esteves como o 4º lateral, o Fábio Silva como 4º avançado (suplente para taças da liga, por exemplo). Quanto ao Fábio Vieira e o Romário Baró, talvez assumisse que emprestaria um deles para rodar na Primeira Liga e o outro na B e podendo servir os A em caso de lesões.

Thats probably a question of the point of view to it; they might not have ""get things done"" but as we know as living under checks and balances: thats how things are if you really figure out which is the best step for everybody.

&gt;He centralized everything and made it under his control,

-&gt;erased it and became dictator

&gt;but at least they were working and not corrupted.

or rather 100% corrupted since bound to his arbitrary will for the good of himself and his family.

&gt;(not counting the ones that died of starvation or illness from epidemy)

well...the revolution started because of this and as we know: if things went to far there is no short way back

&gt; that would have happened (in way worse) if the first coalition would have invaded France..

which is a bad scenario, I'm with you, but since they didn't even planned to move into the field before France declared war on them (why should they? they were bitter rivals, and rivals with the king of france as well, they weren't even able to fight side by side when it would have made the difference to win instead of loosing: Austria wasn't jet able to forgive Prussia four lost wars, and Prussia had nothing, literally nothing else to win or loose there; having a constitution already and high support-rates it didn't really felt threatened by the revolution).

(EDIT The thing is: it ended exactly as if he never took over the Alps: France occupied. Its army slain. French soil abandoned. ""les enfants de la patrie"" dead.The woman windows. French economy wrecked. French independence gone. A King set on the throne by outer powers....i don't think loosing in first round would have been ore disastrous)


&gt;Yep he was clever enough to make come back those who had money and knowledge.

Not saying it was dump, just a mayor setback for equal rights and all that, literally everything positive about the revolution; this way it was just losses without gain. No freedom or progress from ancient regime left here.

&gt;His family members were indeed at the head of the freed states

oh, i remember when i was a child and the ""conquer this or that"" card in RISIKO got replaced with ""Free this and that "" cards, doesn't really matter

&gt;Absolutly false information, even wikipedia says that the newly states created by Napoléon were less authoritarian than the previous ones.

French Wickypedia possibly: never trust wickypedia on political controversial stuff: even the carnival at the Rhein got banned under french rule (which is why the animator groups march in caricatures of Prussian uniforms, even though some nowadays think it was to ""mock the oppressor"")

Oh, he was Brilliant in Propaganda which is why many welcomed him and expected great deal of freedom and stuff... ...you can read their anger few years later when they became his staunch enemies since he didn't brought the revolution but a setback to conditions which weren't the bad ever before, but people understand the better why among all the french had a revolution when it was said to have been even worse before.

The Most progressive became those states which managed to avoid his and his families direct rule, like Bavaria and Prussia.

&gt;Thanks to him, France went from totally fucked up country vowed to obliteration to an Empire ruling over almost all continental Europe.

Thanks to him the antimonarchist revolution was delayed another hundred years in which France had to recover from the losses he inflicted on his journey across euro, since a empire for a day is nothing but waste of resources.; and he couldn't hold a foot of land, so France ended worse of than ever before.


&gt;Thanks to him France was second behind England in manufacturing weapons

You know that till the threat of the blockade forcing to build up more production capacity England imported great deal of weapons from Prussia?...second...;)

Grantred, he did his best to cripple Prussia by giving mayor capacities to Bavaria, but still; dreams of supremacy and a giant production goods needed by the own military, (but still not sufficient as the end demonstrates, not even sufficient including systematic plundering of the occupied countries) is nothing positive but a complete disaster.

The main premise:

1. Regulations that restrict competition for the idea of protecting jobs have the actual effect of hurting Canadians. Canadian “capital” cannot leave our system. The idea that foreigners profit at our expense by extracting capital in a market trade system is impossible. [Background]
2. In regards to our discussion about Airlines - I want to set up a scenario where if I am wrong about previous statement about the Airlines then we should restrict and ban imports of fruits.
3. You’ve asked questions on why countries industry fails. My answer is this again is a failure of government.
4. Taxes would help. I agree with you, my issues is there is a bigger problem to solve.
5. You argue that Air Canada doesn’t have a monopoly because we have many smaller players.


You mentioned security. I just wanted to start off here about regulations that restrict competition actually hurt Canadians. You said it was a security issue, I would argue that it's precisely the opposite - that is Canadians are more secure. Canadians are more secure if foreigners who vote in another country like America or Europe have an economic self interest in maintaining the status quo, why would they impose restrictions on us or go to war if that could hurt there voting interests. Wars have happened in the past due to markets and products they cannot get, we are freely trading them at this point. 


[ You can ignore this part, as part of our discussion. This is part of the background from point 1.

There is a general failure of understanding economics in the general population and by politicians, everyone votes assuming they understand economics. The ideas of economics are very counter initiative to them. For example: The American rust belt being destroyed somehow hurt America. This is used in the media to show how trade hurts Americans. Many Americas benefited a great deal from the lower prices of vehicles. The upfront damage is shown but the large diffuse advantages at large of cheaper cars are not shown.

That is it is often thought to be a good thing if you are an exporter and a bad thing if you are an importer. 

We often invoke protectionism to maintain jobs here because the fear is those jobs are going to another country. 

Protectionism has impacting of saving jobs you can see at the greater expense of the economy at large because the silent jobs created by lower costs cannot be seen as they are spread over the economy.
]


I agree with you on American’s and European have those restrictions. 

By my general premises of 1. Just because they have those restrictions doesn’t mean we should. The main reason being that we would be less subject to government failures as I’m about to explain. We seriously benefit from “unequal free trade” as trade is never unequal, we are just exporting Canadian currency instead of goods and services. 

“If European and American carriers were able to establish healthy, competitive, and affordable air transportation industries without removing foreign ownership restrictions(in some cases being more restrictive than Canada currently is), then why on earth are you seeking to remove these restrictions domestically rather than simply following the proven successful model in these other countries?”

This is the general premises of 3. We have not talked about this yet. 

The answer: They can have those foreign restrictions if they don’t have a history of Government stepping and breaking the market. That is companies need to be allowed to succeed and fail from the very beginning. 

This requires a history of Air Canada. We did at one time we did have a private fleet. Air Canada was made as a crown corporation. It killed our private airlines business, that is healthy competition in your comparison. It was then made private but it could not run properly without assistance so it has had to be bailed out and ran at a loss. The government could not let this beast fail. They should have let them. 

Now you could say: Let that is all the past. They wanted to give it a chance running as a private company. The problem is that promising Canadian upstarts and knowledge have already been destroyed due to years of being a crown company and then running at loss when it was made private against competitors. They are desperately trying to compete. You could not compete at the transition if one company can run losses then get saved. Today startup costs of being is the airlines industry are much higher due to regulations and rules for ""safety."" Air Canada was using taxed funded to keep it alive. Now the airline business is very hard to get into as opposed to the past. As a Canadian it’s just easier to buy Air Canada stocks if you want a part of the Canadian airline business, because a failure of government has repeatedly allowed it to trip over itself and kill competition. Any money you spend on a new airline business would be better spent on the Air Canada stock because it’s a monopoly [I understand your point of saying it’s not a monopoly because we have smaller regional ones, that would also need an entire point] over the majority of high revenue flight path in current status quo.

You would need both capital startup required and knowledge. Air Canada has never had to compete domestically and worry about failures. It has learned from international flights, but no reason to make that work at home. A foreign airline would exactly fix the wrongs that the government created in the first place.

“Whether or not they are small players isn't really relevant. What routes they fly is.”

If we allowed foreign ownership this would begin to change our capital outflow to inflow allowing trade to increase. Meaning investments would be happening directly in our economy. Right now we are a net exporter of currency and one reason being that money has better returns outside of our country then inside, if we allowed foreign ownership we could actually see capital flow into our country to buy these Airlines and set up shop for development to create competition on the main market. Increasing trade and thus the wealth of Canadians. 

I don't agree that don't they have a monopoly. If continue, i'll talk more about this in another point as I understand it's key to your point of view. The point would be showing that jumping from a smaller to a higher tier one has been made more difficult over time. A simple example, and one you might consider bad is at Steve Jobs was able to make computers in a garage and sell them, over time the barrier to entry has gotten harder. 

Once again by my main premises number 1. We are never hurt by lower prices due to foreign lower prices, I would argue capital can be stolen by opposite a broken system that allowed an unnatural monoploy to form. I want flights like Toronto to Vancouver to be cheaper. I also don't believe Air Canada would fall quickly and jobs would be shifted. 

“high prices and fares”

I would agree with this too. If we lowered taxes it would help. It still would not get us to a free competitive market as our history of government interference and banning of foreign money to develop our market. The bailout of the airline if you look up the past. We also aren’t as capital rich as America or Europe and also just buying Air Canada stocks with it’s stranglehold on the market is better. You can get flights over very long distances in the USA and Europe for as low as 25-50. Just a history of very competitive forces has made them very cost efficient. 

“Right. None of this is problematic from an economic standpoint. When you ""switched over"" to a new proposal the economic issues present with the original proposal were dealt with.”

I did switch over because I did not want to get into things dealing with customs. At that point we’d be talking about cabbage laws, international laws, immigration laws and work permits. I wanted to get a basecase on competition. I actually still stand by those things, I think starting here is simpler then expanding. I wanted to work inside your rules to make my points it. 

The security point I wanted to put above.

“A couple of comments back you specifically stated that we wanted to be a net importer. I'm not sure why you're flip flopping on these positions - I didn't even argue against(or disagree) with your assertion that we want to be a net importer.”

I thought at some point you mentioned our profits from our Canadian flights would somehow be extracted and foreigners would profit at the expense of Canadians. I wanted to show this is not the case. If I have not shown that in the general condition (1) could say more. 

“We aren't ""propping up"" the Canadian airlines anymore than America or the EU are ""propping up"" theirs. It seems extremely clear to me that the higher costs in Canada's air transport industry are due to the comparatively high fees/taxes Canadian airlines are subject to rather than the lack of foreign investment.” 

I understand now why you have an issue with my Fruit Comparison to Air Lines. 

The reason being is that they had better and more fair markets from competition in the first place - as did we. They never had a market destruction of the nationalization of the airlines. That means they got really good at competing. Americans/Europe do not complain as much about price, however they too would benefit from more competition.

What is presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Every report I've ever read from a government study refutes Frum's statements. Even the ones from conservative thinktanks don't agree with him 100%.

If he included some citations; maybe it would be more effective. But he didn't. 

&gt;The Atlantic isn’t a two-bit publication

I actually like the Atlantic and I defend them a good publication regularly against conservatives who treat it like a liberal rag. It has a lot of objective material....which is almost always sourced in some way, form, or fashion.

&gt;almost all of their stories are heavily vetted before making it to print

Part of that vetting is hyperlinking to sources, which is entirely absent from Frum's article.

&gt;You literally don’t even refute any of them

A lot of what he says isn't worth refuting. It's simply his opinion. He argues that immigration is the reason for the rise of right wing populism in Europe and that stopping immigration will correct that. He completely ignores that these groups existed prior to immigration waves and will continue to do so afterwards. It's like blaming racism on black people; it's fucking stupid.

Frum argues that our immigration outlook is based on nostalgia and outdated. He might as well denounce all religions since their teachings are nothing more than nostalgia as well. He offers nothing more than his opinion here...

He quotes Clinton about immigration being a problem but offers no proof. Nowhere does he actually show that immigration is the problem and not archaic social attitudes and right wing neo-conservatism stirring the pot.

&gt;according to a 2016 survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic, nearly half of white working-class Americans agree with this statement: “Things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.”

He offers nothing to suggest this is due to immigration in the modern era. White, working class Americans didn't either. In my experience, they're just as likely to call a 5th generation Hispanic or a Native American an ""immigrant"" as an actual immigrant. Their fear is rooted in xenophobia; not immigration concerns.

Frum uses examples of how the broader European public wants less immigration but ignores that the broader US public wants the same amount or more (Pew data). He's trying to draw similarities between populations that don't share the same opinion on the matter.

I actually spent time reading up on it before I made my post. Every tribe actually given an origin story in 1 and 2 originates from a Vault. Arroyo is from Vault 13. Jackals, Vipers, and Khans are from Vault 15.

In NV, you have the Boomers from Vault 34, the Mormons from Vault 70, the Sorrows/Dead Horses/White Legs/80s who survived in Zion/Utah solely because House stopped the nukes falling in the Mojave area with his high tech missile shield, and that's all. The series tells us that in the rest of the world that wasn't the Mojave, people who didn't take shelter in Vaults, or incorrectly secured Vaults, died of radiation poisoning or turned into ghouls.

&gt;There are also military bunkers, company shelters and privately or community-owned and buildt shelters that can very well exist in other countries as well. The Swiss did build shelters a lot, and the Russians have their giant metro system in Moscow. 

Fallout's world is divergent by 1945, which means their Cold War and everything after it played out differently to ours. All of Europe is canonically impoverished in the 2060s so it doesn't matter if real-world Switzerland and Russia have good bomb shelters, because you need plenty of fuel and food spare and set aside if you want to be able to stock a bomb shelter that can run for hundreds of years. Europe did not have the food or fuel to spare.

&gt;So Europe was well enough in 2077 to have tourists visitin the U.S.

Conversely, you solely attack Islam while overlooking religious violence by Buddhists and Hindus against Islamic and Christian communities.

&gt;**genocide, as prescribed by Islamic scripture**

This is completely false, and extremely dividing and Islamophobic. Recognise that the more that you validate the [""clash of civilisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations)"" US propaganda feat, the more you push the Muslim World further towards extremism as they feel cornered by the seemingly unstoppable march of American consumerism and plutocratic democracy (neither of which benefit Europe in the slightest) as the globally accepted norm. Islam does not endorse genocide or the destruction of the West. The US and its lackeys present you with the worldview that the Islamic World is one monolithic civilisation which is against everything we stand for and that has essentially declared war on us. This is anything but a case of an *""either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists""* scenario.

In fact, across the Middle East, the United States has destroyed the bulwarks of secularism (Tunisia, Libya, Syria) through disasterous ""regime-change"" wars and colour revolutions backed by Turkey, Qatar and the other Gulf monarchies (the truly despotic Islamist states) as well as the Zionist settler-colonialist state and the Muslim Brotherhood. Even now, the Free Syrian Army is in a de-facto alliance with al-Nusra, backed by al-Qaeda. None of this is speculation, it's verified fact.

&gt;**defend China in light of the Uygur situation**

As for the Uyghur issue, I accept that there are legitimate concerns regarding re-education facilities in China and that quality of life in many of the institutions is below what we expect as international observers, and dialogue is certainly needed with China on this issue. Europe, as a part of a free and multipolar world with strong international institutions that are no longer mere instruments of US power projection worldwide, would play a key part in this.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that the people attending these facilties have often been referred to them by trusted members of their community after flirting with extremist (and sometimes terroristic) ideas. In order to preserve China's stability, peace and secular government, they clearly need to employ a wide-ranging counter-insurgency strategy that targets the cultural disillusionment at the core of the rise of Islamist sentiment in Xinjiang Province (which has been Chinese since 60 BCE), rather than simply adopting the American policy of going in and [""bombing the sh\*t](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2015/11/12/trump-i-d-bomb-the-s-t-out-of-isis)"" out of the terrorists with no concern as to the underlying causes of unrest. Education can address these issues, but must do so in a moderately more nuanced way than that of the policies employed by China today.

&gt;**huge federated states**

Nice Eurosceptic dogwhistle.

In **summary**, I am a secularist but I believe strongly in self-determination for all peoples. The secular path likely to be taken by a Middle East devoid of American-Zionist-Wahhabist interference would be a favourable one to Europe, and MENA would serve as a confluence of Europe, Africa and Asia, but a fiercely independent one nonetheless.

The plat gets you access to the Amex Centurion lounges.  SFO is already one of better ones, though crowded, and they're slated to finish the LAX lounge Q3 2019.  Plus, the 5x points on booking flights lets you save up points for an international trip in business/first class if you transfer points to partnering airlines.  The dream, of course, would be an ANA round-the-world ticket.  We're looking at 120k points for economy, 170k for business, and 260k for first class.  You can read the details online, but basically you pick a direction and fly around the world.

On the topic of hotel discounts, Amex frequently has hotel offers on the card, which are usually about 20% cashback.  Right now I have:

 * $100 off $500 or more at Hilton in Europe
 * $60 off $300 or more at Kimpton Hotels
 * $50 off $250 or more at Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts
 * $40 off $200 or more at Caesars Entertainment in Vegas
 * $75 off $200 or more at Hyatt Place and Hyatt House
 * $100 off $500 or more at MGM resorts
 * $60 off $300 or more at select MGM resorts

Hotel upgrades are a function of loyalty programs.  The plat gets you in to Marriott and Hilton at gold level.  As long as you hold the card, your status will never drop below gold.  Marriott Bonvoy offers room upgrades, but being upgraded to a suite requires Platinum or higher.  That said, there are data points of people getting a suite with Gold.  Hilton likewise requires Diamond status to get upgraded to a suite.  Outside of the membership perks, the Hotel Collection and FHR program offers a space-available room upgrade at check-in.  I've never used the HC program, only the FHR program, so I can't speak about HC.  But FHR basically upgrades you to whatever room they feel like giving you.  Sometimes that means no upgrade, because the hotel is sold out on all the rooms they are willing to upgrade you to.  Sometimes this means that, ""Hey, no one is staying in the best suite in the hotel, you can have that one"".

They were not your typical native tribe. Reportedly very tall and widely known to be fierce warriors. They are often claimed to have been cannibals, but this was likely fear-mongering by Europeans and Americans. In fact, when Cabeza de Vaca and his shipmates washed ashore, they stayed on the beach for awhile trying to recover and survive. They *did* resort to cannibalism out of necessity, however when the Karankawa found them and saw this, their first reaction was to start weeping. It is possible they practiced a ritualistic cannibalism with their enemies after battles, but this was a widespread practice across many tribes, not a staple of their diet by any means.

Edit: come to think (been a few years since I've studied this in depth), actually I think it was the case that the natives *didn't* see the sailor's cannibalism, which de Vaca was grateful for as this was feared to persuade them to kill them all. They wept just at the pitiable state they were in. Also, he subsequently lived with them for several years and never mentions any cannibalism. All of which strengthens the case that it was either nonexistent or very rare.

I think personally we should have had a clean break no deal brexit and spent the negotiation time instead preparing the country as much as we could to soften the blow.

The negotiation was never going to be a success because of remain and leave. Remain would not support any deal or actively help to make one, because to do so is to accept the result (which they haven’t and never will.). Likewise, leave would never have supported or actively helped to make a deal because they see any deal as diluting leaving, as maintaining some kind of tie to the project which can be used to push us back in at a later date.

So the whole “brexit” situation has been less about the EU vs UK and more just a continuation of the referendum. Barnier has frankly been irrelevant to the entire process, it was an internal British political scrap.

it's hard. because as an iranian, i can 100% guarantee you that their shitty government is not to be trusted as far as they can be thrown. the instant you make some sort of ""deal"" with iran, they **will** go back on it because the people in charge (of running what was once a beautiful country) are completely corrupt, garabage fires and murderers. their word counts for nothing. they also won't lash out to the USA because their government knows we outclass them - so they make their empty threats but that's all it is imo.

&gt;Wack story. America is not even remotely close to as diverse adms Europe. That's all OP is referring to. America has ethically Segragated communities and that's as much diverse as it gets here. **The most diverse places are big cities like NY, LA, SF, etc. Rest of country is filled with Trumpeters.** (Emphasis mine)

&amp;#x200B;

and not OP. I am not trying to prove that one (Europe or America) is more than the other, I am trying to show that even obscure cities in the United States are more diverse (however you may want to define that) than that this person is claiming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree with your point that it's impossible to truly measure cultural diversity, I never insinuated that it was possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So, is the cultural diversity in the US due to larger economic inequality than in Europe (I assume that there is more economic equality in the US, but I have no proof of that) where people move to another ""culture"" if they happen to get rich, while the European diversity is more agnostic about the economic situation of the people and more of their background?

I don't think it's that simple to tie cultural diversity simply to economics or place it largely on one outcome. I think its always multitude of factors (neighborhood/location, economic, racial, religious, etc.).I agree that it's almost impossible to boil down a person's diversity level to a single identifying marker, but  I have difficulty believing that people's own ""subjective"" ethnic identification is somehow a disqualification. Of course it's a simplification, and they do tend to show an imperfect comparison, but since they are both measurements of ethnicity, I find them flawed but still usable. You have provided no reason beyond opinion to disqualify census numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

But I do believe that using the socially constructed ethnic/racial groups in the US (Black, white) is equally valid as identifying ethnic Germans or ethnic Hungarians, given the long history of racism in the United States that permeates cultural differences to this day. I believe that trying to differentiate between what is more different is impossible. Diversity, as it applies to humans, is a completely subjective and artificial designation. It's impossible to truly measure because it simplifies a whole host of factors amongst people to attempt some form of measurement between categorical differences. It gives very little weight as to how big those differences are and only identifies if differences exist at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Given how every level of how diversity is often measured, ethnicity is a simple and effective tool at getting to that point. It's imperfect, but it at least allows for some point of reference. A more effective analysis would look at  linguistic, religious, sexual orientation, economic, age, gender, political belief diversity. Then it would weigh them in some manner to show the relative difference between them and then assign some kind of score.

NBA is fucking over continental basketball every offseason since 2015. 

12 years ago NBA cap was slightly over 50 million USD. Now it's breaking into double of that. 12 years ago Eurobball clubs' budgets were the exactly the same they are today. And with 2-way contracts, 60 additional player spots were added to the NBA.

With this pace, NBA will have another big cap increase in 2025 and EuroLeague clubs will still operate on same budgets which will be the practical death of continental basketball.

NBA has certain rules, structure and tradition that they should have the best players in the world. Frankly, if the top of the top players were to come to Europe, they would not be maximised here due to Eurobball's own rules, structure and tradition which all constitutes an extremely different game on&amp;off the court than the NBA. The issue is NBA has started to steal away tons of players that would be better maximised here, most of them don't even play in the NBA.

Other societies such as those of Japan, South Korea or Switzerland employ a very indirect way of talking. Both methods are equally efficient and successful as long as all participants know the cultural context. Problems (misunderstandings) only arise when people from two cultures with vastly different modes of communication meet and aren't aware of the disparity. For example Americans among themselves usually understand each other without problems and Japanese people among themselves also know what the other person is saying but if an American travels to Japan and speaks the same way there as he does at home, chances are the Japanese will turn away and think he's extremely rude while the American will be perplexed by how ""unclear"" the Japanese are expressing themselves. Similar situations happen when Germans (or other people like that) come to Switzerland and aren't aware of the cultural difference.

And yes, screaming in public is viewed as rude here. But to be fair, this is the case for most of Europe. Americans are generally considered annoyingly loud in Europe.

&gt; European leaders have resisted calls to start reimposing sanctions on Iran after the country said it had for the first time broken the terms of the nuclear deal it signed with foreign powers in 2015.

&gt; European leaders had urged Iran not to breach the deal, but the focus may now be on dissuading Iran from taking further, more serious steps away from the terms.

&gt; Iran previously has enriched to 20%. At a meeting with Iran in Vienna last Friday, the EU announced it had set up its long planned EU-Iran trading mechanism, Instex, and said the first transactions had been completed.

My reference to truth was not meant in the ""true justified belief"" sense. Truth as the description of a beliefs relationship or accordance with reality, as you said.   


If we want to speak in terms of academic philosophy when I say ""objective truth"" I'm referring to the noumenon.   


Also I'm not arguing for [absolute morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism). I'm arguing for [moral realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism).    


My argument begins with an assumption of moral realism as a premise. If you disagree then we can discuss that as a separate issue.   


But what I'm arguing is that all in all, most people's moral frameworks don't actually differ all that much, what fundamentally differs is people's understanding of reality itself.   


Case in point:    


Nazis believed that the Holocaust was justified because inferior peoples were propagating out of control and leading to a degeneration of society.   


These beliefs were formed through the material realities surrounding the German people and Europeans in general. The industrial revolution, the rapid urbanization and rampant crime and squalor, the increase in inequality, the expansion of globalization, and the atomization of local and traditional communities etc etc.   


They were correct in identifying there being issues with the modern capitalist paradigm but they interpreted it through an ontological schema which identified the source of the problem as being ""degeneracy"" rather than recognizing the systemic nature of capitalism and technology. They based their beliefs on [anthropological theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race#19th-century_physical_anthropology) , and [biological theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Origins_of_scientific_racism) which had no merit.   


IF there were in fact an out of control propagation of inferior peoples directly leading to the destruction and dissolution of human society, then YES it would make sense to try to reform, kill, or control such people. This is in fact the same argument that is made by democratic societies when they lock up people for breaking the law, and by communist societies when they create ""re education camps"".   


Nazis and racists are immoral but they're immoral largely because their worldview is fundamentally based on falsehoods.  


When one engages with Nazi rhetoric on a purely moral schema level you ultimately do your argument a disservice by ceding their greatest weakness. The fact that they are factually wrong about their premises.   


It can seem easier to argue the issue on moral schema because moral schema seems so wishy washy. There are dozens of competing theories of how to best formulate morality. I take the view of [GE Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy#Moore's_discussion) that most of these are fundamentally misled because they are attempting to reduce the irreducible. Fundamentally... most moral schema come to pretty similar conclusions *as long as* they are also operating under the same worldview of how reality is and works.",False,False,False,,0,1562008183,,False,0,{},esi7brx,False,t3_c7r29b,False,True,t1_esi10r1,/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/c7r29b/friendly_reminder/esi7brx/,False,,1571209674,1,True,[],False,ChapoTrapHouse,t5_3ezs3,r/ChapoTrapHouse,public,0,

He's been doing all the talking about ""tackling the child abuse issues"" and had been ""admitting"" that it exists in the Church throughout his tenure, but no real steps have been taken that the outside world considered concrete and effective in getting the guilty charged and punished.

Here are some the steps that are considered major in the eye of the church and its followers, and IT IS LAUGHABLE:

I'll add the ones you already mentioned:

* actively attempt to restore people's faith in the church by admitting that the church covered up a BUNCH of misconduct for decades.
* being a true Christian by exposing the church's flaws, asking for forgiveness while attempting to correct their mistakes.

____________

* He asked young children who are about to be abused to remind the priests that they are going wayward!

&gt; Pope: ""if you see a priest at risk, because he has lost the joy of his ministry, or seeks affective compensation, or is taking the wrong path, remind him of his commitment to God and his people, remind him of the Gospel and urge him to hold to his course.""

&gt; Francesco Zanardi, an Italian survivor of clergy sex abuse and president of the Abuse Network, said Francis’s guidance to young people - asking them to help wayward priests - went against ""every prevention protocol"" and indicated that the pope wants abuse to be handled internally.

&gt; ""Prevention means reporting and making it public,” Zanardi said. “You can’t just remind [a priest] of his Christian values. What will a pedophile think? ‘Wow, I got lucky.’ ""

________

* Performing a ""powerful"" mea culpa, making forceful statements, pressuring child abusers to resign. Much concrete! Wow!

&gt; January - he took a trip to Chile and ended up embroiled in a scandal where he was defending a bishop who had been accused of covering up sexual abuse.

&gt; After he botched the affair in Chile, he did admit his mistakes, and he made a very powerful mea culpa. And over the year, he has made many forceful statements against predator priests. He's also pressured several bishops to resign. He's talked the talk, but many abuse survivors say he hasn't sufficiently delivered.

ZURICH.- El presidente Mauricio Macri recibió hoy en su visita a Suiza el premio ""Living Football Award"", primera edición de un reconocimiento que la FIFA entrega a las personalidades destacadas del mundo por las acciones que han liderado para el desarrollo del fútbol y el sostenimiento de los valores del deporte como vehículo para el crecimiento de las sociedades. ""En este mundo que necesita del diálogo, el fútbol tiene que ser el puente para lograr ese diálogo que derribe las barreras. El fútbol refleja la cultura de cada nación"", subrayó Macri, en un acto realizado en la sede de la FIFA. El presidente fue acompañado por Gianni Infantino, responsable de la FIFA, y Alejandro Domínguez, el titular de la Conmebol.

Macri puntualizó que ""el futbol ha sido una escuela"", que le ha dado ""momentos increíbles e inolvidables"" y afirmó que ""la pasión crece más cuando uno pierde que cuando gana porque siempre se quiere revancha"". Recalcó que se considera un ""fanático del fútbol desde muy chico"" y recordó que ya desde adolescente abrazó la idea de convertirse en presidente de Boca, cuando se dio cuenta de que no iba a poder ser ""el 9"" del xeneize.

""Hay que profesionalizar la conducción, apostar por los talentos y saber transmitir una mentalidad ganadora, la marca y la identidad del club para sumar a los jóvenes"", añadió.

En tanto, Infantino remarcó que Living Football ""es algo que nos habla al corazón, una manera de vivir el futbol"" y que el premio busca reconocer a las personas que ""hacen mucho"" por el deporte. ""Por eso decidimos entregar a Macri por primera vez este premio, especialmente por el respeto que se ganó en el mundo y no sólo por sus títulos conquistados"", destacó.

En ese sentido, subrayó que, ""como presidente de la Argentina, está escribiendo la historia con el acuerdo entre el Mercosur y la Unión Europea"" y aseguró que por ese histórico logro ""van a llegar más reconocimientos"".

Por su parte, Domínguez sostuvo que la distinción marca ""un momento histórico para Macri, la Argentina y fútbol mundial"". ""Hablar de Macri se puede resumir con los títulos que ganó. Convirtió a Boca es un ejemplo de lo que es creer en grande, lo llevó a la cúspide y contribuyó al crecimiento del fútbol mundial"", puntualizó.

The only way we're going to succeed in Europe is within the EU. We're never going to get things 100% our way 100% of the time, compromise is the aim of the game within the EU. Which i think is something that our government has failed to understand in the negotiations with the EU.

Needless to say, this uprising was suppressed, reportedly without violence, by the Czech legions, which were the closest thing Czechoslovakia had to an organized army. Relations were complicated from Day 1.

The German ""minority"" (which accounted for over 3 million people, the Czech population was barely twice that size for comparison) actually enjoyed decent political representation and economical sovereignty during the First Republic. The demographic was just about as varied as the Czech one, and there were Germans from the worker class all the way to the upper, landowners and industrialists included.

The Czechoslovak Republic was built and governed in such a way to benefit the Czech population first and other populations second. Despite this, out of all the minorities, the Germans enjoyed the biggest privilege, arguably even more than the Slovaks for example, though that is debatable. German institutions, schools and language weren't exactly promoted by the national government on a grand scale, but weren't suppressed either. Due to the uneven distribution and the prevalence of Germans in the border areas, it wasn't hard for Germans to find a prevalently German-speaking environment and sort of have ""their own place"" within the republic.

From the beginning, most German voters were distributed between the DSAP (German Social Democrats), DCVP (German Christian Social People's Party), BdL (German Farmers' League) and DNSAP (German National Socialists - disclaimer that national socialists =/= nazis). Most of these parties found representation through cooperating with their Czech equivalents, the DSAP cooperated with the Czech Social Democrats, BdL cooperated with the RZSML (Czech Agrarians) and so on. By a rule of thumb the German parties usually had 50-25% of the seats of their Czech equivalents and so played a decent part in their respective coalitions.

While there always were some tensions, they were far from a boiling point and apart from the language barrier, Czechs and Germans got along fairly well.

And then 1933 came. And Hitler came to power. And the Sudetendeutsche Party was created. Oh god. Oh fuck.

As one would expect, the nazis had a polarising effect on the German population in Czechoslovakia through this proxy party of SdP. Its mere existence threw a giant wrench into any prexisting harmony there was between Czech and German parties. In 1935, the SdP has **fucking won the national elections** (by a plurality). As in, they got more votes than any other Czech or German party in the whole fucking country. Keep in mind that the German, not necessarily voter population, counted around 3,5 million people, while the SdP received 1,2 million votes (!!!).

From this point on, things went south. When 1938 rolled in and the Sudetenland crisis came, you had SdP freikorps and other nazi-funded paramilitary groups conducting raids, sabotages and attacks on Czech military and law enforcement installations, including customs offices and barracks. A special volunteer home defence organisation had to be created by the national government, that's how much the government was scared of this looming threat. If a war were to break out, there would be 2 fronts - the one on the German border and the other everywhere between that and Prague. Things GOT HOT.

In October 1938, Sudetenland got annexed and SdP got absorbed into NSDAP. The Czechoslovak government subsequently plummeted into absolute panic and a single-party authoritarian state became to form over the couple of following months, with a government desperately trying to stall for time and trying to keep the Czech populace calm while knowing all too well a full-on annexation is coming. And it came, in 1939.

&gt; # [El acuerdo Mercosur - UE es ""fake"" | Algo falso que no es lo que aparenta](https://images.pagina12.com.ar/styles/focal_16_9_960x540/public/media/articles/3131/macri.jpg?itok=GwTcrwha)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; No se conoce la letra chica del acuerdo Mercosur - Unión Europea. Los principales afectados, a favor y en contra, no fueron consultados. Funcionarios del gobierno dicen que recién ahora se reunirán con ellos para comentarles de qué se trata lo que se firmó en Bruselas. Un Gobierno que se jacta de la apertura al diálogo y al consenso avanzó en una negociación, dominada por el secretismo, que puede definir la matriz productiva del país ignorando la opinión de industriales y de trabajadores de sectores sensibles.
&gt; 
&gt; Este comportamiento se entiende en la firme convicción del presidente Mauricio Macri de que la industria argentina es vetusta, como se lo ha dicho a varios de los principales dueños de grandes firmas productoras de manufacturas, y, por lo tanto, no merece ser considerada como prioritaria. Un desprecio que mezcla ignorancia acerca de cómo se han desarrollado los países y una rivalidad no resuelta con su padre industrial. Franco ha fallecido; ahora le toca el turno de terminar con la industria y le será más aliviador a él si en primer lugar se encuentra la automotriz, donde el grupo Macri fue uno de sus protagonistas con Sevel (Franco echó al hijo Mauricio de esa empresa por la escasa habilidad que demostraba en la administración del negocio). Por lo pronto, ese objetivo ya lo está cumpliendo porque el sector está siendo destruido en sus años de gobierno.
&gt; 
&gt; Otro motivo para explicar ese acuerdo es que la administración macrista responde a los intereses de los jugadores más grandes del agronegocio, quienes parecen ser inicialmente beneficiados del acuerdo con la UE. Uno de los máximos representantes de esa actividad, Gustavo Grobocopatel, actuó de vocero de ese grupo con una militancia fanática a favor del macrismo.
&gt; 
&gt; Se debe sumar una razón más rústica y de cortísimo plazo: aplicar un golpe de marketing político con el objetivo de tener algo para mostrar en estos meses de elecciones en un frente que ha acumulado una sucesión de fiascos estrepitosos en estos tres años y medio de economía macrista. Esto último ha quedado tan en evidencia que resulta grosera la repetición de eslóganes difundidos por la red de propaganda pública y privada acerca del carácter histórico de un acuerdo que no se firmó.
&gt; 
&gt; La grey de economistas liberales deberían ser más prudentes en festejar el anuncio del Gobierno si después no quieren quedar asociados al fracaso de otro experimento neoliberal, como pasó durante la gestión de Alfredo Martínez de Hoz en la última dictadura militar y de Domingo Cavallo durante el menemismo. Si es por la bandera ideológica del libre comercio les servirá para un debate económico que atrasa un siglo; pero si tienen la expectativa de que existe un acuerdo ya sellado se chocarán otra vez contra el muro del marketing político del oficialismo.
&gt; 
&gt; El macrismo, siendo fiel a su esencia, presentó una instancia de la negociación como si fuera un hito histórico, cuando en realidad no se firmó el acuerdo, sino que se definieron líneas generales. Condiciones que, también respondiendo a la naturaleza de la Alianza Cambiemos, benefician en exceso a la contraparte (a los europeos) con la ilusoria esperanza de conseguir la simpatía de capitales extranjeros para invertir en el país.
&gt; 
&gt; Uno de los negociadores del acuerdo Mercosur-Unión Europea en el gobierno anterior, Carlos Bianco, ex secretario de Relaciones Económicas de la Cancillería, ilustró con un ejemplo “el desastre” -como lo calificó- de lo pactado, en El Destape radio. En 2004, el Mercosur pidió que la Unión Europea autorizara el ingreso de 400 mil toneladas de carne; la contraoferta fue 100 mil toneladas. En 2010, sin avances en ese punto, se definió que ninguna oferta europea posterior podía ser inferior a esas 100 mil toneladas. De acuerdo a lo que se difundió, el Mercosur ahora aceptó 99 mil toneladas. No sólo no subieron la cuota, sino que es menor al mínimo ya establecido. Bianco reveló que conversó con uno de los negociadores argentinos y que él le dijo que había que cerrar el acuerdo porque “lo dicen de arriba (se refiere a Macri) para hacer el anuncio” para las elecciones.
&gt; 
&gt; Las “_fake news_” se emiten con la intención deliberada de engañar, inducir a error, manipular, desprestigiar para obtener un rédito económico o político. El anuncio del acuerdo Mercosur-UE realizado por el macrismo se encuadra en la definición de _fake_: algo falso que no es lo que aparenta. No es un acuerdo final; la letra chica no se definió; lo que se avanzó se mantiene en secreto; es un anuncio político en tiempos de campaña electoral; no tiene beneficios generales para la economía argentina; aumentarán las importaciones y disminuirán las exportaciones porque se perderá el mercado brasileño a manos de los europeos.

Again, terrible reasoning. The reasons for people's residency in countries are largely out of their hands. It relies on a variety of political, social, and economic reasons. 

For instance, Chinese emmigration relative to its population is quite small. Using your terrible logic, you could say their restrictive policies and authoritarian policies are somehow justified, demanded by the majority, or morally superior. Terrible reasoning.

&gt;I'm not usually in favor of absolutist policies for anything.

There are limits to speech in the US. They don't pertain to things so pathetic as policing insults. Imagine pathetic governments combing through people's Twitter accounts, waiting to jail people for the equivalent of being a playground bully. This is not freedom nor is it the responsibility of government.

&gt;It's reasonable to allow judges to not allow people to advocate that African Americans be sent to death camps or whatever. 

It is also apparently reasonable to censor comedians, jail those who criticize religion, and arrest people for making a joke with their dog. Once you grant the power to censor people for ""offensive behavior"" you grant the stupidest nonsense.

&gt;reasonable amounts of free speech you will have.

""Reasonable speech"" goes with ""reasonable"" human rights or ""reasonable"" freedom. It is a laughable phrase that sounds like it should be coming out of the mouth of a Saddam or a Gaddafi.

&gt;As long as democracy is in effect and the people want there to be reasonable amounts of free speech, reasonable amounts of free speech you will have. And if there's a dictatorship, or the people don't want to allow reasonable amounts of free speech, well, sooner or later you're not going to have reasonable amounts of free speech regardless what any constitution says.

Yes, and one of the great things about the American system is that it adjusts for the tyranny of the majority and grants fundamental human freedoms for everyone and doesn't leave it up to a majority vote.

&gt;See paradox of tolerance. If you're entirely tolerant of everything, that means being tolerant of people who want to establish a dictatorship. Being allowed in the public square gives them a chance to succeed, with demogogery and so forth. If they succeed, they tolerate nothing. So instead of almost all free speech being allowed, you have no free speech being allowed.

**The British Isles**

Great Britain has too many religions which aren't fleshed out. If it was a battle between four religions which all have some sort of defensive bonus (e.g. decisions to call troops in religious defensive wars) it would be fine, but currently that's not the case. My idea would be the following:

Have a syncretic religion of the former Greater London area. If you want to insult the British make every county outside of this area tribal. Make it a tolerant mishmash of non-Christian religions found in the area currently. A sort of mix between Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism.

Most of the rest of England could be Anglican including Canterbury, the current seat of the archbishop of the Anglican church. Maybe give some credit by making the Queen a sort of Mary-esque figure, the saint of the British isles.

Most of the rest of Britain should be a sort of Druidic nature worship. This is different from simply returning to old gods instead they reinvent nature worship and directly pray to the various names of wind, rain, earth or forest. Use Gaelic names to make them more mysterious. 

On the west coast of Ireland catholic provinces and realms should exist who have managed to weather the storm of the apocalypse.

**Catholicism**

Moving on to the mainland and talking about Catholicism and Polish Catholicism. I think the current split should be differentiated. I would split Catholicism between a more rigid and more ""liberal"" version. What does this mean? I would suggest that Poland, Southern France and parts of Italy follow a sort of inverse Franciscan Catholicism with a crowned Pope for both versions. Subjecting the enemy faction to restore theological unity could be a good goal for the early to midgame for the faithful and unity would unlock new abilities to rally for a crusade for example.

**Lutheranism and Deism**

I personally dislike the trope of the returning viking gods, especially coopting Lutheranism for it. What I would suggest is making Lutheran a tolerated heretical Christian with the Patriach feature. It would fit the style and breathe some life into an otherwise boring trope.

Deism is too boring. The Jain-like features only make sense in a peaceful environment. I would suggest the following. Dissolve the religion, add southern Finland to Lutheranism and give the Baltics a new religion. Make it a raiding religion, very commercial and very amoral. It should be a backstab fest and terrify neighbours. Maybe give it even coastal Poland.

**Black Forest, Atomist, Mountain Gods, Basque and Chavs**

The religions should simply be removed.

**Political and Philosophic Religions**

The cult of Reason and the Europeanism should be merged and mystified. First up this merger lead to more gameplay. Brussels could be the centre of a unique system, neither HRE nor ERE. The core lands could be the vestiges of a post-deluge empire, the core lands are ruled by a council president while all europeanist rulers swear tribute to them as semi-autonomous vassals. The religion itself would be a mix of different religions and ideas to choose from. Secularised Christianity could be an option to choose from. The Cult of Reason should be a heresy.

Soviet should have its name changed and be a collectivist unreformed folk religion. To make this obvious maybe change it so that they have access to a special government type, which makes their standard feudal primary holdings cities.

**Hellenism**

The story should be changed so the Greeks were forced to raid after the deluge to survive and have acquired a tradition of seafaring this way. This would make it possible to conquer new colonies and also reason the changes to Hellenism I propose. After the raiding habits of the southern Greeks turned worse a sacking of Mount Athos broke the camels back and the surviving Orthodox clergy denounced the Greeks. The Greek church in turn declared themselves independent and now it is a maritime version of Orthodoxy in which the sea plays a major role. It is still considered a heresy and has buffs, but if it is ever conquered it will be deactivated as a valid belief destroying the papacy and force converting all remaining believers.

I think these changes would make the mod much more unique and interesting.

It was the eastern Germanic tribes who favoured mounted warfare, the Ostrogoths and Vandals in particular were noted for their extensive use of cavalry. The Lombards picked up mounted warfare on a larger scale as they swept into Northern Italy abosorbing Gothic remnants and pushing back the Byzantines.

I went through a phase of intense saving and then backed off a bit over the period of 8 months or so.  To be frank it was one of the most life-changing phases of my life, especially since at the beginning I got a job that paid me more money than I previously would have known what to do with.

&amp;#x200B;

My recommendation is to think about your finances more in terms of priorities.  For me, I like tinkering with servers, exploring eastern Europe, sailing on the weekends and knowing I have enough money in the bank to leave a job I don't like (it came in handy when I left that high paying job because my boss and team were toxic).

To either ""live it up"" or save and ""not live"" is a total cop-out.  Spend enough to do what you like, but don't waste your money on things you don't really enjoy.  It's that simple.  Although, everyone takes a different amount of time to understand where their current priorities are.

&amp;#x200B;

Spending all your money and living a life of fear over creditors and debt collectors is no way to live your life.  For now enjoy your health and take this moment in your life to think deeply about what makes you happy and what that would mean in moderation.

Yes, there is a point at which you stop worrying about coalitions, and that point will get earlier and earlier as you get more experienced in EU4. The first general way to deal with coalitions is to prevent them from forming. Your allies get a heavy penalty to any AE you would accrue against them, so strategically allying large powers in the next area you intend to go on a warpath through is a good way to keep your coalitions manageable or too small to form in the first place. Also, anyone whose relation with you is greater than 0 will never become outraged no matter how much AE you have against them (although the instant they hit -1 they will flip to outraged, so be careful) so by using diplomats you can drastically increase the amount of AE you can generate in an area before coalitions begin forming. In general, if you want to hyper-blob, your best bet is to conquer the world one religion at a time; if you go on a warpath through Europe and every Christian nation is outraged towards you, the Islamic world still won't care, so pick a religion and unify it by the sword.

&amp;#x200B;

The second general way to deal with coalitions is to aggressively attack them. Nobody who has an active truce with you counts as a potential coalition member, so if you have 25 outraged countries and 23 of them are in a truce with you, a coalition cannot form. This is the strongest (and most difficult) way to deal with AE. You can, for example, rampage through the muslim world with no practical limits as long as you are willing to be in a truce or in a war with every single Islamic country in the game at all times. Alternatively, you can just let the coalition form, coalitions aren't as scary as new players think they are. The biggest thing is that you HAVE to attack the coalition, instead of letting them declare a punitive war against you, because punitive wars have a big negative modifier to the war leader's desire for peace that will make it incredibly difficult for you to end the war. If you attack into a coalition (and choose one of the smaller countries involved, who you can stackwipe and fully occupy quickly) you can then pick up just a little bit of warscore from occupations or battles and white-peace the entire coalition out, putting them all in truce and freeing yourself up for more wanton conquest. The downside of this is that the coalition will generally reform in 5 years when the truce is up, and you cannot declare more than 1 war per month so you will only be able to separately attack 1 or 2 of the original coalition members before it has fully reformed. One way around this is to allow the coalition to partially reform before attacking it again, splitting the coalition into separate truce timers. Another way is to attack an ally of one of your coalition members, and add that member as a co-belligerent; this will circumvent the inability to separate peace coalition members and allow you to put every single member of your coalition on a separate truce (try to space them all at least 1 month apart).",True,False,False,,0,1562019371,,False,0,{},esish6q,False,t3_c7s9wr,False,True,t1_esi8xqv,/r/eu4/comments/c7s9wr/the_imperial_council_reu4_weekly_general_help/esish6q/,False,,1571219749,2,True,[],False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,0,

Com o ritmo atual de desmonte da estrutura de fiscalização e da legislação ambiental demonstrado durante os seis primeiros meses, a destruição da floresta pode atingir um limite irreversível ""em dois governos Bolsonaro"", prevê o cientista Paulo Artaxo, doutor em física atmosférica pela Universidade de São Paulo (USP) e estudioso da Amazônia desde 1984, quando viajou para lá pela primeira vez como parte de sua pesquisa de doutorado. 

Estimativas mostram que, desmatada uma área de 40% da floresta, o restante não consegue sustentar o funcionamento de um ecossistema de uma floresta tropical chuvosa e, nesse cenário, parte da floresta poderia virar cerrado. A Amazônia já perdeu 20% da cobertura original. 

""É uma questão absolutamente crucial para a estabilidade do clima do planeta - assim como reduzir as emissões de combustíveis fósseis dos países desenvolvidos"", explica Artaxo.

Hoje em dia, ele vai à região pelo menos uma vez por mês para supervisionar o Projeto LBA, a torre de 325 metros que investiga a atmosfera amazônica e que permitiu ao cientista ajudar a desvendar a formação das nuvens de chuva na Amazônia. 

Artaxo é um dos 12 brasileiros que fazem parte da lista dos 4.000 cientistas mais influentes do mundo, feita com base em números de citações em artigos acadêmicos pela [Highly Cited Researchers 2018](https://hcr.clarivate.com/). Também é membro, desde 2003, do Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC). 

O pesquisador conversou com a BBC News Brasil na última quinta-feira (27), quando começou a ser noticiada [a resposta](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-48783709) do presidente Bolsonaro aos comentários feitos pela chanceler alemã Angela Merkel sobre a política ambiental do Brasil - ao chegar ao Japão para a cúpula do G20, o presidente afirmou que a Alemanha tinha muito o que aprender com o país e que não tinha ido ao encontro para ""ser advertido"".

Para Artaxo, é justamente a pressão vinda de outros países o único caminho que pode frear o atual processo desmonte da fiscalização e da legislação ambientais que ele afirma ter se iniciado com o novo governo. Usar temas econômicos como moeda de troca, como foi o caso do acordo entre Mercosul e União Europeia, seria uma estratégia eficiente nesse sentido. 

Enquanto isso, o cenário que era de mudança climática se encaminha cada vez mais para o de ""emergência climática"" global. 

Nas condições atuais, o planeta vai aquecer em média 3,5ºC. No caso do Brasil, ""vamos ver o Nordeste se desertificar totalmente nos próximos 30 anos, vamos ver alterações profundas no bioma amazônico e mudanças climáticas sem precedentes nos últimos 10 milhões de anos"".

""Isto vai ocorrer. O que nós podemos fazer é minimizar esse cenário.""

Leia, a seguir, trechos da entrevista.

   Direito de imagem Paulo Whitaker/Reuters   Image caption  Brasil reduziu o ritmo de desmatamento de 24 mil km² por ano pra 4.000 km² entre 2004 e 2012   **BBC News Brasil - Como o senhor avalia a agenda ambiental nesses seis meses de governo Bolsonaro?**

**Paulo Artaxo - **A mesma coisa que o Trump fez nos EUA. Basicamente desmontar toda a legislação ambiental - que, no Brasil, foi construída a duras penas ao longo dos últimos 30 anos, incluindo Código Florestal e assim por diante -, e desmontar toda a estrutura de fiscalização do Ministério do Meio Ambiente.

Porque este governo tem como uma das principais bandeiras o não cumprimento da lei. Nós temos um governo que a todo momento diz: 'Olha, não vamos cumprir a lei, essa lei não vale, essa lei não é boa'. Seja de cadeirinhas para criança no carro, seja o cadastro ambiental rural na Amazônia (o presidente editou em junho Medida Provisória extinguindo o prazo para os proprietários de terra fazerem o cadastro). 

Então, a lei que eles não gostam não é pra ser cumprida. É a primeira vez no Brasil a gente tem um governo que vai contra sua própria razão de existência, que é dar um ordenamento jurídico para um país como o Brasil. 

**BBC News Brasil - Em termos de medidas concretas, em que consiste esse desmonte ao qual o sr. se refere?**

**Artaxo -** O principal é você estimular ações violentas no campo. O atual governo está fazendo isso, primeiro, por meio da não repressão quando esses atos violentos ocorrem. 

O Brasil hoje é campeão de ações que matam ambientalistas, aqueles que lutam pelo direito da terra, ações contra populações indígenas e assim por diante. O que a gente vê é uma fração muito pequena do que está ocorrendo no campo, que é o que acaba saindo na grande imprensa. 

A segunda questão é a destruição de todo o sistema de fiscalização ambiental no Brasil. O Ibama tinha, por exemplo, um sistema chamado Prevfogo, de prevenção de queimadas, que tinha centenas de funcionários há um ano e hoje está reduzido a algumas dezenas de pessoas para cuidar do combate a queimadas na Amazônia. 

É um sistema que, mesmo que o Brasil no ano que vem retome a necessidade de combater queimadas, basicamente todas as pessoas que estavam lidando com isso foram dispensadas.

**BBC News Brasil - O governo fala, nesses casos, que isso é reflexo da falta de recursos, que acaba afetando todos os ministérios... **

**Artaxo -** O Brasil é a nona economia do planeta e não existe essa questão de falta de recursos. Falta de recursos é uma justificativa para você implementar a sua própria agenda. Por que não faltam recursos para pagar os juros da dívida? Por que não faltam recursos para financiar a produção agropecuária brasileira? Por que não faltam recursos para se dar subsídios às indústrias? 

E faltam recursos para manter um sistema como o Prevfogo, que custa absolutamente nada para o país, mas que foi desmantelado. O discurso de falta de recursos não existe. O problema é onde você aloca os recursos. É a mesma coisa nos EUA. O Trump desmontou toda a estrutura da EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). É falta de dinheiro? Não. É ideologia. 

**BBC News Brasil - O sr. elencou então como segundo ponto esse desmonte da estrutura de fiscalização...**

**Artaxo - **Fiscalização e legislação. Aí entra, por exemplo, o desmonte do Conama (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente, criado em 1981 e do qual o físico faz parte), da estrutura de monitoramento e acompanhamento das mudanças climáticas globais, que antes era dividido entre Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia, Ministério do Meio Ambiente e Itamaraty. 

Se você vai hoje nesses três órgãos e pergunta quem cuida da questão climática no país, você não encontra ninguém. Toda a divisão de clima do MCTI não existe mais. 

É um desmonte que, para se refazer toda essa estrutura num próximo governo, vai demorar de 10 a 20 anos, realisticamente. 

**BBC News Brasil - Do ponto de vista ambiental, que tipo de consequência de médio e longo prazo essa política pode acarretar? Pode haver algum tipo de dano irreversível?**

**Artaxo -** Pode não, já está tendo. O desmatamento na Amazônia já está aumentando, porque todos os mecanismos de combate foram desmantelados. 

Não são problemas futuros - é no presente. A questão de agrotóxicos. Vamos ter algum problema no futuro? Não, estamos tendo no presente. São quase 250 novos agrotóxicos, inclusive que são proibidos em outros países, aprovados nesses seis meses. Não é no futuro, é prejuízo hoje, que já está ocorrendo.

**BBC News Brasil - Existe uma conta de que o ""ponto de não retorno"" para a Amazônia, a partir do qual a floresta entraria em autodestruição, seria um desmatamento de 40% de sua área. O quão distante estamos desse limite?**

**Artaxo -** Ontem (26/6) o INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) soltou um novo número de quanto da floresta original foi desmatada. 

Nós desmatamos 20% - 20% de 5,5 milhões de km² é uma área absurdamente grande. Estimativas de cálculos do Carlos Nobre, do Thomas Lovejoy mostram que, se você desmatar 40% da floresta, basicamente o restante não tem condições de sustentar o funcionamento de um ecossistema de uma floresta tropical chuvosa. 

E aí todo o carbono que está armazenado naquela floresta vai para atmosfera, agravando em muito e acelerando em muito as mudanças climáticas. 

Nós não estamos falando de um aspecto trivial ou de um aspecto que não tenha impacto sério sobre o clima do planeta. É uma questão absolutamente crucial para a estabilidade do clima do planeta - assim como reduzir as emissões de combustíveis fósseis dos países desenvolvidos, em particular dos EUA. 

**BBC News Brasil - Então estamos no meio do caminho?**

**Artaxo -** Isso, estamos no meio do caminho. E o restante do caminho pode acontecer nos próximos oito anos, durante dois mandatos de governo Bolsonaro. 

**BBC News Brasil - No ritmo atual, essa é uma possibilidade real?**

**Artaxo -** Não há menor dúvida. A única coisa que pode impedir isso é pressão internacional. É o que a Merkel está fazendo essa semana (a chanceler alemã declarou, em sessão do Parlamento, estar ""muito preocupada"" com a atuação do presidente brasileiro na área ambiental, disse considerar a situação ""dramática"" e afirmou que conversaria sobre o tema com Bolsonaro durante a cúpula do G20).

Plastic bags?  Let retailers and customers do what's best for themselves.  I actually like the European model, bags are available for the customer to purchase, and many customers choose to bring their own bags.  I reuse plastic bags to line trash cans, for scooped cat litter, for policing dog poop, and other things, so I like to get them, although I usually bring my own bags when shopping at the store that sells bags instead of giving them away with purchase.  

Your retailers compete in the marketplace.  If consumers such as yourself start asking them to do something to encourage their customers to bring their own, reusable bags, great.  If enough people ask retailers to either stop using plastic bags, or reduce their use via charging for them, you can probably effect the change you want without involving government to do the heavy handed work for you.

Don't waste your student loan on liberal arts or whatever. If you love writing but you can't make money from it, THEN DON'T FUCKING WRITE! Sorry for coming off harsh but when you choose a career, profit is the first thing you should look for. If that thing also combines your passion, even better. If you like writing, then maybe you should invest your time into learning the copywriting skill. You could write ads for people. It's like a salesperson but in print. This is a high income skill.

The issue, however, isn't with the *length* of the Mediterranean Sea vs. the Atlantic Ocean (as one can see, a nonstop trip across the Mediterranean would have been analogous to an early modern voyage across the Atlantic.) It's that a nonstop trip across the Mediterranean would have been ... daft.

In the ancient world, and frankly even to today, the Mediterranean would have had a *lot* of different ports of call. A merchant vessel would therefore *not* be sailing directly between Alexandria and the Pillars of Hercules (as the Strait of Gibraltar was known then), but rather would be sailing, say, from Alexandria to southern Greece, from there to Syracuse (in Sicily, on to some port in North Africa, and from there on to the Pillars, dropping off and picking up goods and supplies at every waypoint. So, instead of sailing 3000 miles in one fell swoop, it would have been several journeys of 400-500ish miles each. Sailing directly from Alexandria to Lisbon made no financial sense whatsoever.

As a consequence, our Roman mariner would have had no concept of the deep sea crossing from the Azores (which, to be fair, is about halfway across the Atlantic) to the North American mainland, and such a journey would have required a vessel with about double the storage space for crew supplies (and hence either a bigger vessel or a vessel with less space in the hold for salable materials) than what would have been common in the Mediterranean. European discovery and colonization of the Azores [only dates to the fifteenth century,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores#European_discovery) anyhow.

Now, to be fair, there was a *significant* [Roman trade with India,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDTaOOVbxLs) following the monsoon routes, and the Arabian Sea crossing is actually analogous with the deepwater crossing of the Atlantic from the Azores to the North American mainland -- about a thousand miles.

However, there was a good reason to be undertaking such risky voyages, and there would have developed separate seafaring cultures within the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean basins; there was little in the way of a good reason to challenge the River Ocean on his deep when markets further west remained unknown.

Finally, galley ships, like triremes, were primarily warships. It makes some sense for them to be mercantile when plying coastal routes, because there were ports-of-call roughly a day's journey away from each other, or when one was trading at the fringes of the known world (such as down the African coast), where more bodies = more defense, but the typical merchant ship sailing in the comparatively safe waters of the Mediterranean would have looked more [like this.](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/39/2c/ea/392cea67e8c1815ef10b886ebeefe79a.jpg)

However, I'm not a huge fan of purchasing $1,200 items from Europe due to potential difficulties in returning the item if there are issues. So I decided to buy the rim from Amazon, and I'm glad I did. 

As soon as I got the wheel out of the box the button frame around neutral popped off as you can see in the picture (top left). You can see (maybe) around the switch in the top left that the tube they use to shine light through the wheel is rough cut compared to the on on the right. Moreover, two directions of the 7 way hat switch didn't work or weren't working correctly. The neutral button felt kind of loose as I wiggled it around a bit. Finally, the stickers that were applied were already lifting. 

The carbon had a bit of flex. More than my Simulaje F1s which Barry mentioned flexed a bit. I don't think this is an issue in a normal driving scenario. 

If any one of these things were an issue, other than the broken hat switch, I would probably let it slide with how much I like the shifters. However, all of these issues on a $1,200 rim feels wrong and it will be going back tomorrow. 

What I can say is that grips felt nice. The shifters were great and the CNC machining all around was excellent. I really liked the rotary encoders as well. 

I wish Cube Controls had better quality control, but I won't be buying from them again. 

I'll upload pics and a video so people can see in better detail the issues. 

Images: https://imgur.com/gallery/A7JzZAF

The first image is the missing button guard, then rough cut on the light tubing, then peeling stickers.

Edit: I figured out the issue with the hat switch/7 function switch. And it isn't as bad as I originally thought. 

The button top is 3d printed (I assume based on the layer lines under the switch) and doesn't fit the switch quite like it should. It is allowed to sit a bit too low against the button frame impeding it's movement. When I tried engaging the right and down directions a few more times the switch engaged which surprised me as I thought it was broken, but then when I turned the switch it didn't engage the rotary encoder which was working prior. 

Pulling the top off the switch you could see that it is glued on (I assume that the glue gave way when I got the hat switch to engage. The other option is that the switch top was designed for the hat switch and the plastic gave way, but I don't think that is the case as it looked like it was glued on) and doesn't have a grub screw the hat switch/7 function switch is designed for. A little glue is all you need to fix it. 

I do like how they finished the switch top and I wouldn't have known that it was 3d printed unless I pulled it apart as the bottom didn't have the same finish.

Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug.[10] It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein.[9] Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation.[9] Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils.[9] High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature.[11] Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.[9] Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.[12]

Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain.[10] After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur.[10] Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death.[10][13] Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity.[14] Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.[10]

Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.[10] This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain.[10] It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier.[15][16] Cocaine is a naturally occurring substance found in the coca plant which is mostly grown in South America.[9] In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally.[17] It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to US$500 billion each year.[10] With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.[10]

Cocaine is the second most frequently used illegal drug globally, after cannabis.[18] Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year.[10] Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America.[10] Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life.[10] In 2013, cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990.[19] The leaves of the coca plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times.[14] Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860.[10] Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.[20]

Space Megaforce, known in Japan as Super Aleste (スーパーアレスタ), is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed by Compile. It was published by Toho in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as part of the Aleste series. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a spaceship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from American and European ones. However, Super Aleste also offers a ""Short Game"", where only a set of small levels are played, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.

There are two very important things you have to do with normies.

 A) figure out where they need to be redpilled first: women, media, demographics, black crime, iq, religion, Jews.  Everyone needs a different starting point. Take days, weeks or even months, studying your target and seeing where they are the softest.  I started with gender, then demographics, then race, jq last.  If someone had tried to start me on race or jq I'd probably still be a democrat right now. 

B) The most effective redpilling is the balance of exclusion and inclusion in addition to subtle shifts in language.  Jews do this artfully and we could learn a lot from them. With exclusion you simply don't tolerate people in your closer social circles who are verbally anti white.  This is HUGE and it's how people broke through my liberal bubble. There's a deep visceral reaction people have when they feel they've transgressed the group consensus or might be excluded entirely (especially in women). I was hanging out with some conservative boomer Canadians (and I like Canadians) and they straight up shamed me for saying I don't care about white population decline.  This deep down got to me because they made me look a bit stupid in the social setting I was in at the time and that created a seed of cog dissonance inside of me that as a logical critical thinking person I just couldn't shake off.  For weeks is just sat in my subconscious festering. It was a sweater string just dangling. Then I went down the path.  Inclusion is another approach.  If you have a younger friend, brother, sister, girlfriends, wives, charges that look up to you they will go with whatever you tell them if you say it with conviction and you do it in a slow way.  You have to condition people.  This is also how cultural Marxists slow boiled the frog and how sexual predators operate but it's a powerful force that can be used for good as well.  Condition people *slowly*.  Marinate them first in anti leftism/degeneracy (which comes natural to almost everyone), then anti Marxism, then European pride, then white nationalist ideas.  Especially if they are people forced to be around you.  Family members and best friends can't easily push you out of their life.  Never try to redpill someone fast who is someone you can't afford to lose/alienate in your life.  It's also a good rule of thumb to not even try with people over 40.  Unless they show hints of interest when you drop clues.

Virgin Queen might be a little more accessible than HIS but basically you have the equivalent of 3 or 4 war games going on all at the same time.

You have the Vatican vs Protestants in their own thing across Europe, you have Suliman invading from the Ottoman empire, you have England just trying to produce a male heir, you have the Holy Roman Empire trying to hold Europe together &amp; exploit the New World, you have France trying to snipe at the HRE. Historically each of the factions have an ""ally"" (France &amp; Ottomans oddly enough, England and the Protestants, HRE &amp; the Vatican) although all the goals are kind of muddied. 

It's a card driven wargame, similar to Twilight Strugle where decks get added to the main deck as time goes on. Leaders age and die, and you just have to deal with their historical replacements for better or worse. There's a \*lot\* of negotiation, in fact the first round I believe starts with the Field of Cloth of Gold where England decides if it's going to side (temporarily) with France or Spain. Meanwhile Martin Luther is kicking up trouble and sets off debates and purges and reformations across Europe that basically just make everyone's lives miserable. 

It's a trip of a game. It's kind of a grail game since it's so heavy &amp; involved. Check out some of the play by forum or session reports over on the geek. It's a trip.

 No dia 18 de junho, membros do Ministério Público Federal de todo o país fizeram uma votação interna e [escolheram três nomes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/procurador-experiente-na-area-criminal-encabeca-lista-triplice-para-pgr-veja-nomes.shtml) para compor uma lista tríplice que será entregue ao presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 Embora não haja previsão legal nem constitucional, todos os presidentes da República, desde 2003, têm indicado alguém da lista para a PGR.

 “No meu sentimento, o presidente tem direito de escolha constitucional e o Senado aprova ou não aprova, após uma sabatina, o respectivo nome”, respondeu Toffoli ao ser questionado se, ao indicar alguém da lista tríplice, o presidente poderia fazer um aceno positivo ao MPF.

 “Do ponto de vista do Supremo, o que eu teria a dizer? Seria importante que fosse um subprocurador-geral, ou seja, que fosse alguém da última classe da carreira. A própria lei orgânica do Ministério Público estabelece que, para atuar nos tribunais superiores, tem que ser do último degrau da carreira”, afirmou.

 Estão na lista tríplice, nesta ordem, dois subprocuradores-gerais, Mario Bonsaglia e Luiza Frischeisen, e um procurador regional, Blal Dalloul —nível intermediário na carreira. 

 Questionado em seguida sobre uma eventual recondução da atual procuradora-geral, [Raquel Dodge,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/raquel-dodge/) o presidente do Supremo respondeu que ela tem feito um excelente trabalho.

 “A doutora Raquel Dodge tem desempenhado um excelente trabalho. No âmbito do CNJ [Conselho Nacional de Justiça] junto com o CNMP [Conselho Nacional do Ministério Público] temos várias atividades em conjunto”, disse.

 Dodge não se inscreveu para disputar a eleição interna. Em 2017, ela chegou à PGR, indicada [por Michel Temer (MDB),](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/michel-temer/) após participar da disputa e ficar em segundo lugar na lista tríplice.

Britain doesnt give 2 shits about HK. 

From HKU press, ""[Concise History of Hong Kong](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/con/5.pdf)"":

&gt;During the countdown to 1997, the Western media depicted Hong Kong as a bastion of democracy, free expression, and prosperity, often ignoring how for so long Hong Kong had been a **colony with little democracy or freedom of expression**. But any assessment of the British colonial legacy must consider the entire colonial period rather than only the last decade or so of British rule, when the British introduced last-minute political reforms. 

&gt;Although colonial Hong Kong was theoretically based on the rule of law, some jurists and legal scholars argue that common law has never taken root in Hong Kong, mainly because it is so different from the traditional Chinese legal system, while others suggest that most people in colonial Hong Kong had only a superficial knowledge of common law because the language of the law was English (trials are often still held in English, as many judges are expatriates and most counsels received their legal training in English). 

&gt;Furthermore, the government  enacted a wave of anti-Chinese legislation from the earliest years, passed various emergency and discriminatory ordinances, and often censored the Chinese press. The 1951 Control of Publications Ordinance, which made it an offense to publish anything that might incite people to commit sedition or treason, was not repealed until 1987. As journalist C. K. Lau argues, Hong Kong’s “supposedly high degree of press freedom” should be “better understood as **allowing the press great latitude to comment on Chinese politics, but not on the legitimacy of British rule**.” 

&gt;Hong Kong’s colonial civil service was generally efficient and politically neutral, but until the last years **Europeans dominated senior positions on the grounds that Chinese were not qualified or trustworthy enough**. Political power, writes Leo Goodstadt, “was controlled by colonial officials, alien in both language and culture who, with the other members of this European minority, enjoyed superior status and influence solely on account of their race.” Because they were so isolated from the Chinese community, “expatriates were in no position to identify the frustrations and the aspirations of their constituents, their fears as well as their hopes.” Because these expatriates had little knowledge of life in public housing estates, for example, **standards of housing and social services “fell well below what Hong Kong could afford** even after its prosperity was assured by its export triumphs.”

&gt;Similarly, James Hsiung argues that because they were not problems facing expatriates, the colonial government had little concern about Hong Kong’s inordinate **income-distribution inequities, “the very problem of abject poverty amidst affluence”; the “scandalous” condition of the elderly living in poverty; and the lack of unemployment insurance, which the government believed would only encourage laziness**. “The sad thing,” laments Hsiung, “is that this lack of compassion perpetuated by colonial policy as such has rubbed off on the British-educated local elite even into the postcolonial era.”

&gt;Hong Kong has often been described as a capitalist’s paradise and as one of the world’s freest and most competitive economies. But this economy historically depended on political patronage and **discriminatory monopolies that favored large British firms**. Directors of large British firms such as Jardine and Matheson, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and the Swire Group regularly held seats on the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. Cable and Wireless, a British corporation, had the telephone monopoly until very recently. 

&gt;Well after World War II, the colonial government refrained from encouraging industrialization because it violated official colonial policy of stressing trade and commerce. The overrepresentation of business and professional classes in the colonial power structure also restricted competition in the property market. As historian Ming Chan puts it, free trade and free enterprise “did not always  mean fair trade and equal opportunity.”

&amp;#x200B;

Mas vamos pro seu segundo pseudo argumento.  


Você disse:  (Eu falei ""Se você esta tentando impedir pessoas de usar o SUS... você não tem direito de usar."" )  


Continuo discordando... Primeiro que, se pessoa X defende o Livre Mercado, e fala à favor do mesmo, não significa que essa pessoa X esteja querendo IMPEDIR alguém de fazer qualquer coisa que seja. Ela apenas está transmitindo seus anseios aos demais, votando em quem pensa igual, falando sobre o assunto, divulgando as ideias, etc, para que ela(PESSOA X), possa viver em um ambiente que considera mais favorável a todos. Está, portanto, lutando pelos seus ideais.

Se eu quero uma casa específica W, na esquina Y do bairro Z, não significa que eu estou tentando IMPEDIR que outras pessoas morem nessa casa, apenas significa que eu QUERO/DESEJO morar naquela casa específica W.  


Um outro exemplo melhor: Eu gostaria que o governo privatizasse as universidades federais, mas enquanto isso não ocorrer, vou usufruir(e tenho direito) dessas universidades se eu precisar. Depois que privatizar, usufruo se quiser e se puder($). De acordo com você, por pensar assim eu estou tentando IMPEDIR que pessoas estudem em universidades federais ""de graça"", logo, eu não deveria JÁ HOJE ter o direito de estudar em uma federal. Quando na verdade eu apenas gostaria que o dinheiro fosse realocado pro SUS(que atende mais pobres que ricos) ao invés de ficar nas universidades federais(que atendem mais ricos que pobres). Ou, caso o dinheiro não fosse realocado, poderíamos diminuir os impostos, aumentando a qualidade de vida da esmagadora maioria da população. Com menos impostos, as pessoas conseguiriam enriquecer com mais facilidade, e poderiam pagar suas faculdades ou de seus filhos, de repente nem precisariam pensar em faculdade pois teriam mais oportunidades. Dei o exemplo de realocar pro SUS mas por mim o SUS também não existiria, mas vejo como retorno muito mais útil de impostos do que universidades federais, por isso o exemplo. Sem o SUS, teríamos que pagar ainda menos impostos, e seria mais fácil pagar planos de saúde com esse dinheiro extra que o Estado roubaria a menos do nosso bolso.

The IQ scale was then made to prove white Europeans’ intelligence, but this one is very biased. Since African people didn’t learn the same stuff as Europeans, they had lower scores on such tests. That doesn’t mean they are dumber at all; it just meant they weren’t taught the same things! 

Europeans also made up the existence of a pure Aryan race to oppress those who weren’t “pure”. Of course, white Europeans were the purest of them all and they were obsessed with keeping it that way. This was especially a big thing in America, where it was completely unheard of and illegal to be in a relationship with someone from another “race”. 

Back to the concept of an “aryan race”. This idea was spread throughout the entire world. Europeans used it to create an “us vs them” feeling within other cultures. 

There were “aryan people” within African, Asian, ... cultures who were treated better and were privileged . The Europeans used them to keep the other cultures in check.

Or anyone who is concerned about managing the flow of oil and stability of the region. Which sometimes has knock-on effects.

Take Syria: theoretically it wasn't in the interests of anyone but warmongering US policy makers, as some would see it. Then a million people ran into Europe and the entire EU political landscape shifted. 

&gt; This same line of reasoning could be applied to Israel's nuclear program 

And the US bribes Egypt to keep the peace with Israel, provides a security guarantee for KSA (and other Asian nations like Japan and such) which discourages them from looking for their own nuclear deterrent. 

In the event that the US pulls out or is perceived to be unreliable or a close rival gets nukes, all those nations under said umbrella  have their incentives changed. I believe the Saudis have explicitly warned about this. 

&gt;Given the US's history of aggression I'd say it is absolutely fine with ""boiling over"", 

US history does give reason for cynicism but I think this is going too far.

You'd have to explain why, under this theory, Obama negotiated the deal at all or the reaction to intervention during his term.

&gt; I would almost say it's irrational for the iranian government to not pursue nuclear weapons

Sure. And the US perceives that it is in its interests to deny it to them. That's what the topic is about: the US effort.

&gt;Why?

It's curious that you want me to explain. I know you know why. 

Nations, especially nations that are hostile to the US don't want to give it things for free. There has to be some concern over the consequences of not making a deal that will justify them folding, especially on matters of utmost importance like this.

Look at Assad: Let's say Assad wants to gas his people to win the war. If there was no credible fear of US military response, why should he  back down when Obama warns him against doing so? It's a matter of survival and victory, if costs are not imposed upon him, why should he risk losing? And look, once he felt that it was unlikely for violence to happen to him for it, there was news of gassing again in Syria.

The US is currently in a space where people are deathly afraid of intervention and doing ""the wrong thing"". So the solution seems to be locking down any action because it's assumed to be the ""wrong thing"" prima facie. But there will be times when you simply run into intransigence and imminent problems where you do have to flex your muscles. 

The entire point of having the most powerful military force in history and all that diplomatic and economic cachet is to be able to use it to get nations to move your way.

Pakeha (European New Zealanders) were culturally very close to European Australians and British people and identified strongly with them. Even had the Maori been angry enough at the waste of life in WW2 to rebel (which didn't happen), Pakeha would likely have still seen the losses during the war as a noble sacrifice to help their European brethren. It's unlikely that the Maori would have been able to convince the Pakeha majority to submit to non-European rule and become a minority in a Polynesian country.

At the time, there were also attempts by the New Zealand government to dilute Maori culture and society, which argues against them allowing any serious cultural influence from the rest of Polynesia. Most non-Maori Polynesian influence here is limited to Auckland and was brought by immigrants, who would presumably have moved to Hawaii in this timeline instead. The Maori King movement is important to our history, but never had all that much of a political impact.

My feeling is that modern-day Kiwis would be much more likely to join such a confederation than at that time, as the culture has become much more syncretic and outward looking. Also, it feels like a Maori cultural and linguistic resurgence is happening now, with the support of broader society, and a large part of Auckland's population today is Polynesian, to the point where it is sometimes referred to as the cultural capital of Polynesia. But I suspect people would still expect New Zealand to be at the heart of the union or an equal member in an EU-style federation, and people may not be too pleased with another monarch in an age where many are questioning whether we need our current one. Also, the South Island is far more Pakeha-dominated than even the North Island, and I can't see the people there being too pleased with this arrangement.

EDIT: It might actually be more likely that non-Polynesian Pacific countries like Kiribati and Fiji would want to join. And New Zealand territories or states in Free Association like the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau would have a reason to leave NZ and join this federation.

Most western fantasy is based off of Europe not in the 21st century but medieval Europe of the 11th 14th centuries or about 1000 years after the Roman Empire. It also is using a lot of tropes that originally came about during the Renaissance (rebirth and also rediscovery of the ancients) of the 14th-17th Centuries.

Only towards the end of these time periods did Europe really surpass the Romans all out. Both in technology and in size of empires.

Further, most major religions are based on texts that are around 2000 years old, and that one of the tropes of modern philosophy, only somewhat in jest, is that it is all a footnote to Plato. Even today we are often not that different. However much I might wish we were.

The classic Fantasy tropes are based on very real human creations.

I personally get more out of the genre knowing that interplay, and many writers intentionally use it hoping that people get something of it.

That is a letter written by Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania to the Financial Times about the marijuana crisis of Albania in 2017. I would like to hear your thoughts on it.

I think that trying to focus on the elimination of the underground drug industry sounds like good publicity and that is probably what the EU members want to hear. Although, that means getting rid of a profitable industry that supports many of its people and the economy. So, why not legalize it and profit from it safely? Probably because that is not in the interest of the Mafia that controls it and which likely controls the elected government officials.

So getting rid of a significant amount of judges - even if they are believe to be corrupt - does not immediately improve the judicial process but rather slows it down dramatically. The two changes that will significantly target corruption with the Mafia and politicians is by putting in place the right checks and balances as well as ways to reinforce those rules. 

Lastly, coming from a business standpoint, the country wants better quality of life then it will need to focus on promoting foreign investment. Although, no investor would want to commit capital to a country that lacks regulatory structure, a robust financial services industry, educated workforce, and safe communities, and the list can go on. So, the first step to making this all possible is by proving to the world that Albania is ready to undergo radical change for the betterment of the people.

Also, it might be hard to explain if you don’t have a basic understanding of how some genes are more resistant/prone to being diluted out than others - which explains why someone can exhibit both clearly sub-Saharan African features AND a beard (or green eyes, Roman nose, etc.) It should not be surprising that this pops up more in America.

“Darker” genes, like having more melanin in the hair, skin, and eyes, are composed of a set of genes (not just one for skin or one for eyes), and these genes are typically dominant. To simplify, a homozygous dominant gene is highly likely to manifest in an offspring, even if the other parent is homozygous recessive. The result is a heterozygous gene that exhibits only the dominant gene.
As for the set of genes that make up propensity for a thicker beard, well they can probably make their way into a gene pool through a few generations while other genes that we know are dominant still stick around. Does that address your point about their beards being thick and dark while they’re also black?

Also worth noting that sub-Saharan Africans can grow a beard pattern, but they do not exhibit the full pattern (or even body hair patterns) of a lot of Europeans (which itself can be diverse or dependent on ethnicity). African Americans will often exhibit this though. For instance, MC Ride from Death Grips looks fully African, but exhibits body hair not typically seen in Africa, except for when he shaves it.

The transit back in Gothenburg is not that cheap, especially considering the significantly lower salaries, but it is the convenience that people are paying for. Also, it frees you up from looking for a parking spot for 10-15 minutes.

[],,xboxg4mer,1403960972.0,,,[],,We're fucked!,dark,text,t2_h66ac,False,[],"When Scotland voted, the union much like a chair had four legs of its campaign:

1). Remaining in the EU

2). Remaining in a stable economy

3). Being given additional powers within the UK to further advance devolution

4). Guaranteeing stability over a leap in the dark. 

My friend, each of those legs has not only broken, but has been sawed swiftly in half by the people who first glued them together. 

Let's go through them in order. 

1) remaining in the EU. 

It's no surprise that Scotland - the only country in the UK in which every constituency, in which 62% (a vast majority) voted to remain in the EU actually wanted to remain in the EU. The benefits that come with it are enumerable and Scottish people have the strongest sense of European identity out of any UK nation. To take us out of the EU, especially when we voted to remain is simply undemocratic. This is also reflective of the fact that the UK is overall undemocratic. Yes we have a vote, but in the past 70 or so years, it has only changed the outcome of two elections. Please let that sink in. Two. This is reflected by the fact that Scotland has not voted in a Tory government since the early 1950s yet we have had a Tory government for more than half of that. In which way is that democratic? It's ok to say you have a voice, but what good is it if it's so quiet that no one listens? 

2) remaining in a stable economy. 

At the time, taking the leap towards independence was portrayed by unionists as being an economic suicide. ""You can't use the pound"" they said. A lie. ""Your oil and gas will run out within a decade"". Another lie. ""You're too small to be independent"". My friend, this is yet another lie. Scotland could use the pound after independence (not that we would want to for very long), our oil reserves have been shown that they will last at least fifty more years and even if they don't Scotland is very nearly at a stage of being fully powered by green energy. And finally the ""You're too small"". Many of the world's richest economy's are close to that of Scotland, some have even less wealth than us and having a small population is an immense benefit as it is cheaper to pay for social programmes such as healthcare and education for 5.5 million that 60 million. Scotland may only have around 8% of the UK population but we do have:

90% of all fresh water in the UK 

61% of total sea area

65% of UK natural gas reserves

96.5% of all crude oil in the UK

62% of UK forest areas

46% of UK timber production 

92% of all hydeo-elextric power

40% of all wind, wave and solar energy production 

60% of all fish landed 

30% of the total beef here

100% of a billion pound Scottish whisky industry

£10 billion business services industry 

£13 billion food and drink services

£17 billion construction industry 

£9.3 billion tourist industry

£9.3 billion chemical service industry 

£7 billion financial services industry 

£5 billion aero-service industry

£4.5 billion in whisky exports

£3.1 billion life science industry 

£350 million textile exports

And 

Over 25% of all wind wave and energy potential in Europe. My friend, we earn all of this and more, annually! Scotland not only has the means to be independent but the means to be so and thrive as one of the world's most successful nations. 

Why on earth would you want to deny yourself the right to actually govern your own country, especially seeing as no country who has ever left Britain's rule has asked to return? Why would you want your wealth and democratic rights stolen by southern politicians in a southern parliament making policies that negatively impact people here who did not vote for them?

3) Being given additional powers 

Immediately after brexit the UK took powers from Scotland in a power grab. They plan to take even more and the additional powers gag was just that; a ploy to get voters on side to keep them subservient to westminister. So not only did they not gove us additional power, they took power away from us.

4). Guaranteeing stability over a leap in the dark

Hahahahaha stability is teresa Mays favourite word yet she has never ran a stable government in her very short tenure. The UK is anything but stable as shown in the past five years. At every turn westminister makes the wrong decision and harms the people of the UK and further destroys their so called precious union, which by the way is not so precious after all seeing as over 60% of Tories would rather have brexit than keep Scotland in the UK. 

You call the snp fascist, my friend, fascism is described as 

&gt; Fascism is a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy 

The snp are left wing, not right, they are fighting for our democratic rights to be protected (especially since the UK after brexit seems intent on suppressing them), remember how I told you that our vote has only counted twice in over 70 years? That's because they don't respect the democratic voice of Scotland. Forcible suppression of the opposition. In this scenario the snp are opposing the establishment of westminister and are indeed being suppressed. Tory owned media has largely ignored positive cases for Indy while bashing the snp at every turnndespite solid and grounded evidence that the UK is fundamentally flawed and that Scotland did not vote for much if what they do. The UK is not fascist by any means and throwing that term around is not wise, speaking as a student of history, in doing so you simply lessen the actual fact that fascist do exist in the UK and that they are indeed invading the UK political scene under the guise of brexiteers. Fascism is no joke my friend and using it loosely seems to make the suffering of those who actually had to suffer through fascist regimes less so please think before you throw it around. Independence would not mean we would get rid of the queen, by all means she will still be our head of state much like Canada and other common wealth countries unless we vote to get rid of her. Indy has nothing to do with the ira and nothing tondo with protestants or any religion. It's a political point not a religious. I know many Catholics who will vote yes and an equal number of protestants who will do so.

No, of course that's entirely up to them. I mean, pressed for a settlement that prolongs the uncertainty in the UK while settling the concerns of the EU.

&gt;What sequencing? You've lost me on that point... 

You know, the ""we'll settle the EU's demands first, and then we'll start to discuss what the future looks like"" - a format designed to maximise the uncertainty for the UK.

&gt;The breaks in the process are attributable to us. If May didn't have a red line on freedom of movement, eg, it would have been a lot easier.

Both sides have red lines. The trick is to be open to innovative solutions - if you're negotiating in good faith.

Did that already. Guy ran away with one of our plane. 

&gt;Hand over PSM to a Japanese Steel company.

PSM just needs to be depoliticized. Once that is done, it will be profitable. I think in early 20s that was a huge demand for Pak steel in central Asia.

&gt;.Or S. Korean if they build a Shipyard.​ (Enticement)

Already been plans in of building one. Can't remember if it was China or some other nation that offered to do this. 

&gt;Hand over Railways to a European/ Japanese/ Chinese head.

We have talented people here, don't need to hand everything over

&gt;Revitalize Railways factory, joint partnership for new locomotives.

Yeah, we need to bring this. But right now, Pak rail is recovering from years off Loss. Once its starts becoming profitable, maybe then.

&gt;Any strikes by doctors or government employees, that hamper their duties or the safety/health of the public will see them fired and on a blacklist. With removal of any special licenses they held.

Doctors in Pakistan have a god like complex. They operate without any fear. Punishing them for protesting, not good approach. Punishing them for their mistakes, I am fully on board. For doctors in Pakistan, I will vote for collective punishment against their whole family. 

&gt;Hire a Chinese/ S. Korean/ Japanese official, with Special Economic Zones specialty, to run and organize Gwadar.

What?

&gt;Joint venture with foreign automotive company .

Already happening. Some came, some didn't. Some canceled as well.

&gt;Construction of small/ medium dams.

Already been done

&gt;Construction of small/ medium reservoirs.

Already been done or being planned

&gt;Reimbursements of circular debts.

Other steps are being taken to tackle circular debt

&gt;Complete disconnection of public utilities for areas with high levels of non-payments. Those caught stealing utilities will be forced to pay debts of the area.

Already been done. But instead of areas, they are doing it to individuals. Many have been arrested. 


&gt;Freeze all land sales to establish who has ownership of said land.

This is a 70+ year old problem that can't resolved by simply freezing. The approach this government is doing is better. First get rid of the corrupt people, then get land reforms in place. Cause if you still have the corrupt sitting, no matter what land reforms you bring, the problem will still be there.

&gt;Taxation on land of more than 130+ acres of land.

&gt;Taxation of more than 125+ acres of arable land.​

&gt;Agriculture tax.

&gt;On crop yields on 30+ acres.​

&gt;Land Distribution.

&gt;Distribution of arable land above 135 acres held by 1 family.

&gt;Preferably to someone who had been tilting it for past years.​

Previous point

&gt;Exotic Animal Tax.

This is good.

&gt;Taxation ID correlated to CNIC ID number.

I am guessing you didn't file your taxes, cause that is what used for your Tax ID. In fact, from Aug onwards, every CNIC number will be converted into tax ID.

&gt;Tax Credits for Social progress

&gt;For children based on years of schooling.

&gt;For women based on employment.

Not that good right now. Maybe once we have a bigger taxpayer bases

&gt;Empowerment of FBR.

&gt;Enforced cooperation of banking industry with FBR.

&gt;Mandatory reporting by banking industry of 'suspicious' accounts &amp; actions.

&gt;Transfer of money requires biometrics of account holder.

Already done. Grab your popcorn, cause from this month onwards, there will be many people being fined or jailed.  

&gt;Empowerment of SEC.

&gt;Increased transparency of holding &amp; investment companies.

&gt;Funding has to be stated.

&gt;Implementation of global rules &amp; regulations of the industry.

This has been going on for a while. Public listed companies are required  to do that. 

&gt;Liaisons of government banking/finance/taxation industries.

&gt;Increased cooperation between SBP, FBR, SEC, FIA/IB.

This is happening. They all agreed to enhance the insurance industry with it 


&gt;Travel with cash.

&gt;Carried cash limited to $5,000.

Already happening. New limit is now $3,000

&gt;All baggage with traveler, regardless of ticket (public/private/chartered plane searched).

Ummm. This already happens. If not, i don't think we would be credited by international aviation authorities. Without the accreditation, no international flight can land in our airport. 


&gt;Empowerment of NAB.

Already in play

&gt;Corrupt Government Official is removed from office.

Can only be done, once law is amended. That can't happen right now, since no majority in senate.

&gt;Land and property is seized from him/her, spouse, sons and daughters (their in-laws if married).

&gt;No pension(s).

Would love to see this happen.

&gt;Blacklisted and Exit-Control list.​

ECL already happens.

&gt;Elected Officials.

What?

&gt;If Election Board documents found to be incorrect:

&gt;Removal from Office.

Already happens. That is why we have smaller elections going on.


&gt;Separate Courts for corruption trials.​

&gt;Local Governments empowered.

Its never about the law. The issues in Pakistan is about enforcing the law. Fix that, and you will solve huge chunk of the problems 

&gt;Removal of ""development funds"" to MNAs.

The only people who can do that are the MNAs,....very unlikely that will ever happen. 

&gt;Direct elections.​

What?

&gt;Removal of either Chief Minister or Governor for provinces.

Provinces still need a leadership to look up to, instead of PM only. Plus, without them, you would be giving too much power to PM.

&gt;Removal of President of Pakistan.​

He/she doesn't have any power right now, except to tell the parliament which direction they should head. 

&gt;S. Punjab &amp; N. Sindh combined into new province with portion of Northern Balochistan &amp; S. KPK.

Already being planned/done

&gt;Gilgit-Baltistan a separate province integrated.

Despite it being a peaceful area right now, there is still too much geopolitics in play here. 

&gt;Balochistan divided into 3 provinces; Mekhran being 1.

Good idea

&gt;Karachi, Lahore, &amp; Gwadar special territories that are provided funds based on population from province &amp; federal.

Already happens. Its just that because of corruption, the fund never see the light of day. 

&gt;Children must attend public schools.

&gt;Can not receive healthcare overseas if offered in Pakistan.

Good idea. For school, if they choose to send to private school, then they shouldn't be given school allowance. 

&gt;No more 'Gifts', property and property in use is taxed.​

What?

&gt;Dissolution of monthly allowances.

MNAs in charge will never let that happen. 

&gt;Elimination of housing allowances transportation to government employees making more than 45,000 rupees.

Not a good idea. Public transportation is crappy as it is. Once that improves, maybe then. As for housing, Try renting a house, and paying bills while making less then 45K. Very difficult. Maybe government can offer housing units to it employee while they are employed. 

&gt;Increase of salaries of low grade officials.

Already happened. 15% for low grade, and 5% for high grade.

&gt;Elimination of 'batmen', 'chai walas', drivers, servants.

That will increase unemployment. 

&gt;Ministers based on education &amp; relevance to ministry. Technocrats or MPA based on experience.

Good idea based on education. But keep in mind, books can only get you so far.

&gt;Removal of

&gt;Government Land.

What?

&gt;Public Auction of government land.

Already used to happen. If i remember it was thing back in late 90s. After that, corruption showed it ugly face. Auctions were held in back street.

&gt;Buyer must show source of funds.​

They have to do it now.

&gt;Land that is environmentally endangered is preserved into a National Parks Department.

Good idea

&gt;Land used for grazing of animals is 'rented' to shepherds. 

Don't know who that will help anyone.

&gt;Economic analyst of potential for a new'Planned City' potential.

We broke to fix current cities

&gt;No more retirement land handout to military or government officials.

&gt;Government land cannot be bought or traded for private schemes. ​

Previous Land reforms point

&gt;Voters must:

&gt;Be able to read &amp; write.

Sounds good on paper, but hard to implement. Also would be against the constitution 

&gt;Have CNIC.

Already happens

&gt;Filed taxes since last election.

Not right now, maybe later when our taxpayers bases is higher

&gt;No dual citizenship.

Agree with that. Or better, to vote, they must have lived in Pakistan in the last 5 years continuously before voting. 


&gt;Ballot boxes guarded by ECP &amp; Police.

Already Happens. But since police is heavily politicized, rangers/army is used.

&gt;Any ballot stuffing is automatic execution of:

&gt;Ballot stuffers.

&gt;Polling station chief and deputy chief.​

Yes turn to the dark side. Let the hatred flow through you. Strike with your angry. Use the force Vadar.

&gt;Career diplomats.

&gt;Merit based.​

corruption, but maybe soon this will be the case

&gt;Removal of 'foreign living allowances'.

Not every country is a cheap place to live. Although government can provide housing unit for the employee to live in. 

&gt;Show improvements in Pakistan relations .

&gt;Show improvements in Pakistan foreign trade.

That will be difficult to measure. Normally that is done by the foreign minster. Ambassador job is not that.
