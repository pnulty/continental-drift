The thread you're replying on is in response to **English is an ethnicity, off course colour is relevant**

Why are you defending that person's statement if colour isn't relevant?

May I also direct your attention to *England was created by Europeans. So was Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Separate ethnicity from citizenship. Citizenship has no colour but ethnicity does. So technically anyone can be an English citizen but not ethnically English (European), unless you believe in trans-racialism.*

Both of those statements are the one you've jumped in on. I'm using that guys definition of English where ethnicity is an issue of colour.

&gt;I would not consider Celts, Welsh, Picts, Vikings, Brythons, Romans and Gauls to be English, and those are all white and European and in Britain. What is English is not defined by that. England is not a physical territory but a mutual alliance and political compromise of west germanic tribes. That is what defines it and is the historical reason for the grouping.

Enforced persecution =/= natural decline. What's happening today is completely different to what happened back then.

The secularization thesis states this: once a religion spreads throughout a particular area/nation and becomes dominant there, it eventually plateaus and declines in favor of secularization. As long as the decline is not *forced* (i.e. no persecution), it inevitably declines on it's own and never returns. This is what Christianity faces in developed western and european nations today. In fact it applies to all religions.

&gt; The weekend negotiations between US President Donald Trump and China&amp;#039;s Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Osaka, have been portrayed in some quarters as a breakthrough in the trade war.

&gt; Given the recent trends in global output and trade, the Fed may have no alternative, particularly since the European Central Bank has indicated the sudden deterioration has forced it to abort plans to end its stimulus program.

&gt; The third prong in Mr Trump&amp;#039;s China attack involves the banking system.

&gt; John Robert ""Joe"" Cocker OBE (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English rock/blues singer who came to popularity in the 1960s, most known for his gritty voice and his cover versions of popular songs, particularly those of The Beatles.

&gt; Joe Cocker was the youngest son of a civil servant. From 1961 Cocker was by day an apprentice gas fitter and by night, in dark suit and bow tie, he became Vance Arnold singing with The Avengers in rough Sheffield pubs. The set included songs by mentor Ray Charles ""What'd I Say"" and ""Georgia on My Mind."" Vance Arnold and the Avengers biggest moment came in 1963 when they supported The Rolling Stones at Sheffield City Hall, and brought the house down.

&gt; In 1962 Cocker left the Gas Board and released his first single, a cover of The Beatles ""I'll Cry Instead."" His band, Joe Cocker Big Blues, built up a large following in the north of England and ventured to France for a two month stint, playing on American airbases.

&gt; The servicemen, many from America's deep south, loved Joe. The French called him ""Le Petit Ray Charles"". Unfortunately when he returned home to England the bottom had fallen out of the local scene. Joe Cocker Big Blues folded.

&gt; For an entire year Joe never did a gig. Then along came the man Joe has called the greatest musician in the world, Chris Stainton. With Chris The Grease Band was formed.

&gt; Songs were written. Soon a demo found its way to Denny Cordell, the producer of The Moody Blues, Georgie Fame, and Procol Harum. Cordell liked what he heard of Joe, and soon set him up in London with a residency at The Marquee.

&gt; America loved Cocker from his first television appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1969. The Press seized upon him. Life Magazine called Joe ""The voice of all those blind criers and crazy beggars and maimed men who summon up a strength we'll never know to bawl out their souls in the streets.""

&gt; However, Cocker wasn't singing in the streets. He was singing at all the major rock festivals of that summer, culminating in the filmed triumph of Woodstock before half a million people (a phenomenal rip-roaring testimony to Joe Cocker in his absolute prime).

&gt; Of the ensuing ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" Cocker said: ""my thoughts were off to Venus, heading for outer space."" Along with Leon Russell and a menagerie of musicians, managers, roadies, wives, girlfriends, hangers on, children, a spotted dog plus a film crew, Joe played forty-eight cities in fifty-six days, to rapturous receptions everywhere.

&gt; The tour left Cocker battered, exhausted, and far from Venus. He ended up, per his own words, ""in a heap in Los Angeles, very disillusioned with the rock business."" 

&gt; In 1970, Cocker sold $3 million worth of records in America alone. His first three albums went platinum and Playboy voted him number one vocalist in their annual jazz and rock poll.

&gt; Cocker continued making albums and songs like ""Guilty"", ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" and ""You Are So Beautiful."" Songs that have become Cocker classics, all dating from the darkest days, back in the mid 1970's.

&gt; As the 80's dawned Cocker was invited by The Crusaders to join them on a song they had written exclusively for him - ""I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today."" The lyrics said it all and Joe received a standing ovation when he sang the song at the Grammy Awards in February of 1982. His duet with Jennifer Warnes on ""Up Where We Belong"", the theme from ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" brought an appearance at the Oscars ceremony in February 1983 and a hit worldwide, including Joe's first American number one.

&gt; From that point on, Cocker went from strength to strength, aided undoubtedly by the love and support of his wife, Pam, who he married in 1987. His Capitol albums from ""Civilized Man"" onwards have been tremendously successful. ""Cocker"", ""Unchain My Heart"" and ""One Night of Sin"" all turned platinum, (the latter also delivering Joe's most recent US top ten song ""When the Night Comes,"" written by Bryan Adams). Joe's album ""Night Calls"", the title single penned by Jeff Lynne, turned gold and headed towards platinum all across Europe within weeks of its release in Autumn '91.

&gt; Cocker recorded theme songs for movies ""9½ Weeks"", ""Harry and The Hendersons,"" ""Bull Durham,"" and ""An Innocent Man."" In 1991 Joe recorded ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" on the Elton John/Bernie Taupin tribute ""Two Rooms,"" which has sold over 3 Million copies worldwide.

&gt; Joe toured extensively and to great acclaim, not the least in Europe where he enjoyed a massive following. There were awards and accolades galore.Among many prestigious shows, he played for British royalty at a ""Prince's Trust Gala,"" ""Nelson Mandela's Birthday Concert,"" the ""Konzert for Berlin"" that celebrated the breaching of the Wall and, in his adopted homeland of America, the inauguration ceremony for President George Bush.

&gt; Joe Cocker ws a survivor, a star and a rock legend. He had hit records in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. Success brought with it a grueling schedule of recording and touring but, after more than twenty-five years on the road he kept going until the end

&gt; On 22 December 2014, Cocker died of lung cancer at his home in Colorado at the age of 70. Read more on Last.fm.

Lol yeah ofc it's a concern for you.  Because you're convinced it's totally natural and innate and totally not something we invented as a societal convention.  It's also not really easy to tell someone's race through their DNA.  If I find a bunch of SNPs that correlate with Western Europe...pretty easy to guess you're white.  But in the 1800's, that same person would not have been classified as white.  And even today, some people in Europe will not consider you white if you're of certain minority groups e.g. Jewish.

Again, race is a societal convention.  I would love for you to take an online course in this.  Every university is on EdX or Coursera at this point offering free knowledge.  Go out there and listen to a Sociology 101 or even Genetics course to understand this stuff.

\&gt; Inadequate because by the standards of gender expression everyone can identify as a man and if everyone is a man then what does the word man actually mean.

Ding ding ding.  You just discovered why gender is a societal construct.  The word ""man"" doesn't really mean anything except for all of the societal baggage we collectively attach to it (e.g. stoicism, manual labor, smoking, etc.).

But others don't for understandable reasons (they see themselves more as women, or as something else entirely).  And that too is their right, and totally fine.

You think these attacks are creating a system that discriminated against you for being a man (gender) and white (race/color)?

History time:

Many blacks never got their 40 acres and a mule. Slavery. Jim Crow laws of the South. Even Democrat Kampala Harris talked about how difficult desegregation was in LA during the 1970’s during the recent 2020 presidential democratic debate. 

Various Native Americans fought for Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 later to be forced by him as president on the Trail of Tears in 1830. The 1819 NA civilization act. 

In 1924, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, giving Native Americans a ‘dual citizenship’ – they were citizens of their sovereign native land as well as the United States. Native Americans gained uniform voting rights in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But it wasn’t until 1968, when the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed, that Natives gained the right to free speech, the right to a jury and protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

Shoots 90% of Native Americans were wiped out by early European diseases. As Chris Rock jokes - when is the last time you saw a Native American family in Red Lobster? At least black people are alive and together. Our Native brothers and sisters were wiped out. 

The Chinese were always hated on - there’s a Canadian commercial that states for every mile of railroad a Chinese life was lost. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. 

The 1924 Immigration act banning all Asian immigration (sounds like Trumps Muslim travel ban huh?) and limiting immigration from racially inferior” eastern and Southern Europe to 2% of the US population from X country. The law was not modified to aid the flight of Jewish refugees in the 1930s or 1940s despite the rise of Nazi Germany. This lasted until 1952 w/ special exception to Filipinos since the USA bought Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines for $20 Mil (at the time) in 1898 form the Spanish. 

Forced internment of Japanese Americans during WW2 (one of the few groups to actually get reparations by Bush). 

Black Americans had to fight for their bloody civil rights in 1965 while free white men were guaranteed US citizenship if they’ve lived in the US for 2 years by the racist 1790 Naturalization act (excluded women and all minorities). Talk about a head start in generational wealth building. 

Federal Housing Administration’s racist redlining in 1934’s National Housing Act that heavily discriminated against blacks. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to fight this practice. 

https://centerforhealthprogress.org/blog/the-racism-of-us-immigration-policy/

I could go on. The point is this - Hitler as an individual could not bear the sum total of the negative karma of his actions. The whole country of Germany had to bear that burden and still do. Talk about white guilt - Germans had to accept and apologize for Hitler for decades even if they all didn’t want to because they lost WW2 and where at gunpoint. 

Same with you as a white man. 

It’s not cool to get attacked regardless of your color. I agree with you there.  United we stand, divided we fall. Follow the money to see who divides us. Only 100 Southerners owned more than 5 slaves antebellum. Most Southerners couldn’t afford that “social status symbol.” And yet the whole confederacy had to bear that moral burden especially after losing the Civil War. 

You do have white privilege. It is systematic and has been codified into law from the beginning of our great (and many times hypocritical) nation. 

You think you work hard? Look at a black working class man. You’d only know if you walk in his shoes though. 

What can you do?

Increase the awareness of how the system is set up for you (example - grocery stores have one ethnic food aisle and the rest are normally products for white people in the USA). 

Learn to talk about race in a calm and educated manner. Have the courage, empathy and strength to support equality for all. No need to spend your life apologizing. Do something.

And my views about the inequality between men and women are justified by the statistics. More than 40% of American couples now meet online and the rate of increase for this method of dating is greater than any other method has previously been. This makes the claim that the inequality that exists in online dating is representative of dating as a whole, have more validity.

&gt; https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/

A bit of a summary here:

regarding online dating there’s actually a huge inequality between both sexes as calculated by economists. To summarize, they use the no of likes a profile online receives as the dating economy. From this they calculate the Gini coefficient which is a measure of inequality from 0 to 1.  “An egalitarian group in which each individual has the same income would have a Gini coefficient of zero, while an unequal group in which one individual had all the income and the rest had none would have a Gini coefficient close to one. When Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett walks into a room, the Gini coefficient of the room shoots up. 

heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing”

On a list of 149 countries’ Gini indices provided by the CIA World Factbook, this would place the female dating economy as 75th most unequal (average—think Western Europe) and the male dating economy as the 8th most unequal (kleptocracy, apartheid, perpetual civil war—think South Africa)”.

BY NO MEANS AM I BLAMING WOMEN FOR THIS PHENOMENON. It’s just how biology uses hypergamy to maximize the number of offspring whilst utilizing the best genetics in a tribe. It’s just a more viable method for a species’ survival

The emergence of online dating has enhanced the accessibility to a wider pool of potential partners. Female behaviour is naturally hypergamous, seeking the best mate she can regardless of her own ‘market value’ to put it in a very crude way.  And this is why the older short fat man telling incels that he made it in his time so we have no excuse not to, is invalid as today’s dating environment is radically different to one before the emergence of online dating.",True,False,False,,0,1561956169,,1561956518,0,{},esgkvly,False,t3_c75uz0,False,True,t1_esfuffp,/r/tall/comments/c75uz0/any_other_tall_girls_get_irritated_when_one_of/esgkvly/,False,,1571181892,1,True,[],False,tall,t5_2qv8g,r/tall,public,0,

&gt; The study doesn&amp;#039;t offer any criticisms of Trump, but it comes amid continued chaffing by security hawks in both parties who have objected to the president&amp;#039;s repeated slights at U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia, public affection for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, and his habit of scoffing at the evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia is attacking Western institutions in ways more shrewd and strategically discreet than many realize,&amp;quot; said Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, an anti-Putin Washington think tank that recently completed its own study of Russian efforts to undermine the West.

&gt; The Pentagon paper, which has not been widely disseminated, assesses Russia&amp;#039;s intentions in an attempt to understand what drives its strategy, outlines a range of malign activities attributed to Russia in regions as diverse as Africa and the Arctic and lays out ways the United States could strengthen its response.

The short of it is, it's really hard to look at an [audio waveform](https://cloudinary-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_770/dpr_3.0,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/waveform_post.png) and be like ""oh, yeah, I know exactly what's happening!"" Okay, maybe you could figure out all you need with a single sine wave - but very few things in nature *are* single sine waves*.

It's far more useful to figure out what frequencies are in a signal, and to what extent. The waveform I posted above is known as a time-domain signal, because it shows amplitude (vertical axis) as a function of time (horizontal axis). We're not so interested in the microsecond-to-microsecond of the signal (most of the time) - we want to know what the signal kind of does as a whole.

Enter the Fourier transform, and variants thereof (i.e. FFT vs DFT, whose acronyms aren't important for the purposes of this post). What the Fourier transform does is essentially extract frequency data from the time signal and mathematically transforming the graph in such a way that frequency is now on the horizontal axis. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guru_Moorthy6/post/how_to_convert_time_domain_data_into_frequency_domain_data/attachment/5ab5e8ea4cde266d5893734a/AS%3A607584901926912%401521870937728/image/conversion.png) is how a time-domain graph might be transformed into a frequency-domain graph. [This](http://www.radartutorial.eu/10.processing/pic/Time_vs_Frequency_domain.print.jpg) is an excellent image showing how you can think of time and frequency domains to be two different axes of the same plane, with amplitude being the common vertical axis.

So why is this relevant? Well, a gunshot is relatively instantaneous - it goes from 0 amplitude to a lot of amplitude instantly (at least, that's what it sounds like to us). In order to move a signal from 0 to high (like a binary signal or a square wave), you need a lot of high frequencies superimposed on top of each other. If you put the sound wave of a gunshot through a spectral analyzer (basically, if you perform a Fourier transform on a gunshot), I'd bet that there would be a lot of high frequencies. If you analyze a sound file with a lot of regular gunfire (i.e., machine gun fire), you'd get a better result (since FFTs are more accurate with longer times), plus a spike at 600 or 800 or 1000, which would correspond to the cyclic rate of the weapon.

&gt;   Cruzar la grieta. Algunos peronistas que vieron cómo avanzaban sobre su partido las ideas de Cristina, expresadas por La Cámpora, sintieron que tenían que optar. Foto: Casa RosadaHace más de 320 millones de años aparecieron l[os primeros mamíferos, los sinápsido](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/psicopatologias-del-poder.phtml)s. La vida se instalaba en nuevos sitios y estos reptiles se volvieron endotermos, regularon la temperatura de sus cuerpos y desarrollaron características mamalianas. Desarrollaron también un cerebro que les permitió sobrevivir en un medio que se volvió más hostil cuando, 90 millones de años después, aparecieron los dinosaurios y dominaron el mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; Hace unos 300 mil años aparecimos los Homo sapiens. N[uestro cerebro se había desarrollado a través de cientos](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/lo-que-dicen-las-encuestas.phtml) de millones de años y nos proporcionaba una información sofisticada que no pasaba por procesos racionales. Inventamos la escritura hace unos 5 mil años y con ella llegaron los dioses. Pero nuestra relación con el entorno pasa, ante todo, por la información que recoge nuestro cerebro. Así como percibíamos la cercanía de espacios peligrosos, cuando vamos a un barrio desconocido podemos también darnos cuenta de que existen peligros, no porque analicemos datos concretos, sino porque leemos inmediatamente los contextos y sabemos que pasa algo peligroso. **Pasa lo mismo con los electores que, antes de leer manifiestos o escuchar discursos, ven a un candidato y reaccionan inmediatamente ante la sensación de que es mentiroso.** Tomamos actitudes en la vida de acuerdo a ese conjunto de informaciones que para movernos en una u otra dirección no necesitan ordenarse de manera consciente.
&gt; 
&gt; **Reciente.** La democracia es una forma de organizar la lucha por el poder que tiene muy pocos años. Nació asociada a los cafetines, a los libelos, manifiestos y textos escritos. Mientras estuvo restringida a un sector pequeño de la población fue la democracia de los textos, de los discursos. El progreso tecnológico incorporó a la mayoría de la población al proceso y dio un nuevo espacio a las formas tradicionales de percibir la realidad. La palabra, los conceptos, la teoría, son indispensables para comprender de manera profunda los procesos, pero las masas se orientan más por la información que les proporciona su cerebro. Cuando nuestro ancestros se encontraban en la selva y veían que los matorrales se movían de determinada manera, percibían ciertos olores, integraban decenas de informaciones de todo tipo, se daban cuenta de que estaban ante un peligro y huían. No lo hacían por falta de información sino porque hacían uso de una gran cantidad de datos que articulaban en su cabeza de manera automática.
&gt; 
&gt; [Una bomba de tiempo](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/una-bomba-de-tiempo.phtml)
&gt; 
&gt; **Vivos y otros.** Al haberse extendido la democracia pasa algo semejante con los procesos electorales. Más allá de lo que digan algunos analistas, existen fenómenos que no tienen que ver tanto con las palabras y los manifiestos como con la percepción de la realidad que tienen amplios grupos humanos. Independientemente de lo que digan los discursos y las teorías, hay muchos argentinos que se identifican con una determinada forma de ver la realidad que tiene que ver con creencias, perspectivas de futuro, sueños de lo que querrían hacer y[remedios para sus insomnios.](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/columnistas/numeros-de-los-candidatos.phtml)
&gt; 
&gt; Desde **hace años sabemos que el kirchnerismo tenía y tiene el favor de un enorme porcentaje de votante**s con percepciones semejantes que no van a cambiar porque les expliquen ciertas teorías o porque les cuenten determinados datos. Suponer que esto podría desaparecer persiguiendo a sus dirigentes o publicando la lista de sus equivocaciones o sus transgresiones a la ley es absurdo. No votan por Cristina porque desconocen que existen los cuadernos de Centeno. Lo saben e integran esa información en un conjunto simbólico en el que aparecen como pruebas de la persecución de los ricos a una dirigente popular. Tampoco desconocen los proyectos que quieren acabar con la Constitución y controlar todos los poderes para bien de su grupo.
&gt; 
&gt; En algún estudio que realizamos hace unos meses nos encontramos con que cerca del 75% de los argentinos admira más al avivado que al que cumple con todas las normas. No es algo único de nuestro país, sino que es una actitud frecuente en América Latina. Reiteradamente aludimos en esta columna al concepto de anomia que explica la actitud del enorme porcentaje de latinoamericanos que no tiene interés en cumplir con las normas, a las que consideran expresión del poder de los ricos. Prefieren vivir en sociedades controladas por un líder mesiánico que exprese sus pulsiones negativas enfrentando fantasmas inexistentes, con discursos patrióticos sin sentido desde un análisis racional. Aunque a algunos analistas no les guste y no entiendan la dinámica de estos grupos, existen y tienen una importancia enorme en todos nuestros países.
&gt; 
&gt; Por otra parte, hay un porcentaje importante de electores que percibe que el país puede ir a una nueva etapa en que vivirán mejor. Por un lado, tienen la información de siempre acerca de que Argentina es un país rico con enormes recursos naturales. Pero lo más importante es que se han incorporado al mundo de internet y la modernidad. Se informan acerca de que casi todos los países del mundo, incluida la China comunista, son capitalistas. Ven el enorme crecimiento de bienes y servicios propios de la sociedad contemporánea y quieren participar de esa prosperidad. Se alegran cuando saben que el Mercosur llega a un acuerdo con la Union Europea y que por esa vía sus productos tienen espacio en uno de los mercados más grandes del mundo. Ninguno de estos asuntos aislado explica sus actitudes. Es el conjunto de que además integra la libertad de prensa, la libertad de expresión y muchos aspectos básicos de la democracia occidental.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dos campos**. La oposición entre estos dos grandes grupos se fue consolidando en la medida en que Cristina Fernández dio un contenido más violento al primero y **Mauricio Macri** logró consolidar y dar sentido al segundo. Las demandas que se hicieron en su momento de que se amplíe la base política de gobierno, incluyendo a personajes políticos que denostaban a **Cristina Fernández**, no tuvo éxito y Macri conservó su identidad. Para la gente que se identifica con el cambio, si el Gobierno incluía a **Sergio Mass**a como jefe de Gabinete, a **Felipe Solá** como ministro del Interior y a Julio Bárbaro como ministro de Modernización, habría perdido todo su sentido.
&gt; 
&gt; Según avanzó el enfrentamiento electoral, la oposición entre democracia y populismo autoritario fue el eje de las elecciones. Algunos peronistas que vieron cómo avanzaban sobre su partido las ideas de Cristina expresadas por La Cámpora sintieron que tenían que optar. La división entre un discurso insurgente y el tradicional del peronismo expresada cuando el General expulsó de la Plaza de Mayo a la Tendencia cobró actualidad. Muchos peronistas conservan las ideas básicas de Perón en torno a la justicia social, pero son democráticos e institucionales. La presencia de **Miguel Angel Pichetto** dio a la fórmula de Macri ese aporte que aparece por primera vez en la política argentina: **peronista sí, totalitario no.**
&gt; 
&gt; La mayor parte de los disidentes de Cristina eran solamente personas que estaban dando una vuelta por el mundo antes de volver a la fuente original en la que nacieron como líderes políticos. De hecho, casi todos ocupan algún lugar en el cristinismo.
&gt; 
&gt; Estos son fenómenos políticos profundos que están en la sociedad. Se expresaron cuando **Mauricio Macri** ganó la presidencia a Scioli con una ventaja muy reducida y ahora, aunque todos los estudios coinciden en que sumadas las preferencias electorales de Mauricio y **Cristina Kirchner llegan a cerca del 80%.** Curiosamente, algunos analistas dijeron que alguien había inventado una grieta dividiendo a los argentinos entre estas dos opciones y que la mayoría está ansiosa de superar esta división. Si eso fuera cierto y la mayor parte de los argentinos quisiera superar esa contradicción, no se identificaría tan claramente con los dos principales grupos en conflicto. Por otra parte, para que se pueda superar la contradicción entre dos concepciones arraigadas de la política se necesitaría que exista una idea tan fuerte que pueda superar y ser una síntesis de las dos iniciales.

Democracy doesn't end at a referendum result. If you see your country heading in a direction you believe is terrible for it then you have the right to speak up and say it's a stupid idea, even if the majority disagree with you. 

This isn't about remain or leave or whatever. This is about those who proclaim to be the guardians of democracy such as yourself having no understanding of how a functioning democracy works. It works by having the argument and having it afterwords, reacting to facts and new events, allowing choice and allowing someone to change their mind.

1. You didn't have technology such as the canon AND

2. You have enough wealthy people inside to draw upon their resources and skills for both defending the city and for producing an effect where those laying seige would be convinced with a few bread crumbs thrown to them to negotiate. The reason there were walled cities around the Mediterranean was that the lifeblood of the economy was trade that relied upon slaves or near slaves to row the boats. Europe paid a price for that oppressive practice with the next 2000 years of war. These days, to think of walls as normal in protecting large areas is an idea which just shows someone has played too many video games.

Walls have never worked to defend national borders. I was an exchange student in West Berlin, decades ago. Erich Honecker, the East German leader, had mine fields, guards to shoot people on sight who were in the no go zone, and the Stasi to provide pressure on the families of the people who had escaped through the Iron Curtain. The Berlin Wall was a tiny part of a wide range of practices.

I think thats by far and large the most important factor in why European flags use these colours so much.

The red white and blue as used in the Dutch flag represented the people (red blood)) the church (white &amp; holy) and the nobility (blue blood). Which wasnt something to think lightly about. The people placed above the church and the nobility, no family dynasty crest/coat of arms on top of the tri-colours. Peter the Great did put a dynasty coat of arms on top of the colours and he placed the white (church) above the nobility (blue) and put the people below (red). Whether there were motivations of changing the positions of these colours i do not know, i am not even sure whether Peter the Great used the same meaning for each colour. Maybe a Russian can explain that below.

&gt;It’s one of the biggest bug-bears of middle-income earners, and an area that is likely to be a focus in the upcoming budget: Ireland still has one of the highest marginal rates of tax in the world.

&gt;Figures from the OECD for 2016 show that Ireland, with a top rate of 52 per cent, including USC and PRSI (55 per cent for the self-employed on earnings over €100,000) is one of only 15 out of 34 OECD countries with a marginal rate in the 50s. Even here, it has slipped out of the top 10, with its rate now the 14th highest on the back of changes in previous budgets.

&gt;Typically, the level of earnings at which it kicks in is €70,044. That’s broadly in line with countries such as Sweden (€66,997); Denmark (€64,453) and the Netherlands (€67,703).

&gt;However, people start paying just a slightly lower rate, or 49 per cent, at a much lower level of earnings. That means a greater proportion of people’s incomes may be taxed at this higher rate in Ireland, compared with other countries in the world.

On the one hand it sucks, on the other hand tax has to come from somewhere and Ireland has made the choice to offer relatively low corporate tax rates. This has to be made up from personal taxation. To look at it from the flip side, Ireland has some of the highest salary levels in Europe, and it arguably wouldn't have if it wasn't so business/FDI friendly with the corporate rate.

It’s not unusual for Vladimir Putin’s actions and statements to trigger a frosty reaction abroad. Theresa May’s facial expression at her photocall with the Russian leader last week spoke a thousand words. She disapproved intensely of the man she was shaking hands with and was determined to make this abundantly clear.

Mr Putin’s bold claim that western liberalism is now obsolete has met with a predictably hostile response. Both men seeking the leadership of the Conservative Party were swift to dismiss his analysis. Jeremy Hunt insisted that liberal values were responsible for generating more wealth and happiness than anywhere else in the world. Boris Johnson was adamant that history would prove the Russian president wrong.

Seeking to derive a coherent political philosophy from Mr Putin’s public pronouncements is no easy task. But on this occasion, he has raised an intriguing intellectual challenge and, tragically, he even may be on to something. “The liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done,” Mr Putin claimed. “It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.”

Of course, the observation mischaracterises liberalism. It is those who advocate anarchism who presuppose that nothing needs to be done. Liberals believe in strict limits on what can legitimately be done by state authorities. All liberals agree that there is some useful role for the state, but they fear growth in its power and scope.

The power of the Putin pronouncement is that those who purport to be the greatest defenders of limited state liberalism appear to be the prime architects of its continued, albeit gradual, erosion.


Any historical analysis of Theresa May’s three-year tenure in Downing Street will inevitably focus on her inability to finalise Brexit, but there is a plethora of intriguing side issues which, taken together, amount to a significant story in themselves. Increased state regulation over individual consumer choices and corporate activity has been relentless.

The list of completed and intended actions by the outgoing administration is too extensive to list here but include the prohibition on the use of cartoon characters in marketing cereals, a ban on advertising of various foods at certain times of day or in certain places, making “ageism” a hate crime, stopping children from buying energy drinks, increasing state control in the setting of electricity prices and obliging companies to report on differences in the remuneration of male and female staff.

On the other side of the ledger, it is hard to find significant examples of the May administration hacking away at state control and granting greater power to the private sector. I feel sure there must be some, but none spring to mind.

The oddity here is that, at the outset, Mrs May did not outline a manifesto of enhancing state regulatory power. She did express some concerns about aspects of corporate governance in Britain, but there was little else to suggest that her premiership would amount to a combination of increasing domestic red tape while failing to execute the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

The surprising, often petty, interventionism of the May administration does not prove Putin’s dictum that liberalism is obsolete, but it does underscore that the current default setting of the United Kingdom is to travel along a path of ever-increasing interventionism and ever less market liberalism. The picture in much of the western world is similar, with the possible, and significant, exception of Trump’s America.

The challenge, and the choice, for Britain’s next prime minister will be whether to continue eroding individual and corporate discretion or whether to chart another course. If they wish to do the latter, it will require a determined effort, not merely a few nods and tweets in the general direction of market freedom.

A frustrating feature of numerous speeches from the prime minister and the chancellor has been the issuing of a rallying cry that the case for free market capitalism needs to be made powerfully again, only to shrink from the task of actually making that case.

So dominant has the Brexit issue been in contemporary debate that it is difficult to discern the intentions of Mr Johnson or Mr Hunt in this wider area of their approach to policy. As is common in the heat of a campaign, both candidates are attempting to make pledges on tax reductions and state spending increases while continuing to prove they can broadly balance the books. But neither has laid out an extensive list of areas in which they wish to see current state powers diminished or abolished. Perhaps neither is committed to such a list at all and prefer a continuing drift towards greater regulation.

The challenge of Mr Putin’s observation is not that western liberalism can be rendered obsolete by a single, micro-level encroachment of the state. The government removing a cartoon tiger from a packet of frosted flakes might be irritating, but it doesn’t of itself herald the end of a liberal society. A little tampering here and a few bans there doesn’t bring the free market system to an immediate end.

However, one can embark on a journey of tempering markets and freedoms that leaves not a well-regulated liberal market, but something that is barely a market at all. That has been the pattern of the last few years. Unless the next prime minister can focus their administration at least as much on liberalising markets as regulating them, then Mr Putin will eventually be proven right. What would be left of free market liberalism would be an emasculated historical artefact, rather than the core guiding principle of our society.",True,False,False,,1,1561970411,,False,0,{},esgwdl1,True,t3_c7q3n3,False,True,t3_c7q3n3,/r/ukpolitics/comments/c7q3n3/could_banning_a_cartoon_tiger_symbolise_the/esgwdl1/,False,,1571187349,0,True,[],False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

Chopping off hands and obliging women to wear a headscarf is *exactly what Mohammed and the Koran said to do:*

* The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and Mohammed and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or **their hands and their feet be cut off** on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the hereafter. Koran 5:33

* I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. **Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.** Koran 8:12 

* And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and protect their private parts and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent and to **draw their veils all over *juyubihinna* [their bodies]** and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands. Koran 24:31

* Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to **draw their veils all over their bodies.** That will be better, that they should be known as respectable women so as not to be *yu'dhayna* [harmed or hurt]. Koran 33:59

Now how would a woman be ""harmed"" for not covering herself up? Abdullah Yusuf Ali, whose English translation of the Koran is one of the most widely used, translates *yu'dhayna* as ""molested,"" meaning a woman could bring sexual assault *on herself* if she is not covered up according to Islamic dictates.

In Sahih Bukhari 6:321, Mohammed said it's wrong for a woman to leave the house without a veil. 

In Abu Dawud 32:4092, Mohammed said that a woman's face and hands must be covered at puberty. 

In Abu Dawud 2:641, Mohammed said Allah does not accept prayers from an unveiled woman. 

In Sahih Muslim 26:5395, Mohammed told women to wear a burka, not just a headscarf. 

[""I say that when a girl walks about like that [without a veil] it is a patriotic duty to sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her.""](http://archive.is/Mcvhv) Quote from Nabih Wahsh, Muslim lawyer, on Egypt's al-Assema TV, October 19, 2017.

[""Either you wear a veil or you get raped.""](http://archive.is/OKDkH) Quote from one of the most prominent Islamic scholars in Europe, Tariq Ramadan. He said it to one of his own rape victims. 

What's that you were saying, Redouane Ahrouch, you fucking liar? 

In fact, there are several different forms of lying that are sacred to Muslims:

1) **Taqiyya** is saying something that isn't true as it relates to the Muslim identity. This is a Shiite term. The Sunni counterpart is *muda'rat.*

2) **Kitman** is lying by omission. 

3) **Tawriya**  is intentionally creating a false impression.

4) **Muruna** is ""blending in"" by setting aside some practices of Islam or Sharia in order to advance others.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably not the first time this topic has been posted but i weirdly feel strongly about this and wanted to voice my own thoughts on the subject.

I'm a 28 year old white male, living in Europe. I have no idea how it feels to be a person of any other color and i would never think i could ever imagine how it feels to be the victim of racism or living as a minority. But i'm not here to discuss racism as such or the extend of it - although i know it is far too wide spread and common (it shouldn't exist at all really).

I personally feel that the n-word should either be banned completely or be allowed to be used by anyone. I know for some (perhaps most) it is about the history of the word, how it was used as a derogatory name for centuries, or perhaps just the history of oppression in general. But that's part of my point - it is history (not neglecting the fact that racism is still an enormous problem at this time). Nowadays, pretty much every tweet made by a young black person talking about another person (white or black) will call them the n-word. ""What this n. doing lmaoo"" etc. Most black people i see/hear/know call each other the n-word.

I feel like its the only remaining thing that makes me feel a division, a disconnect between our cultures. A feeling that skin color actually makes you different in some way, since it determines how you greet each other and what you are allowed to say. If we are really one people, or at least strive to be. To really see past the color of your skin and only see a person for what they are: a person, a personality, should we then continue this tradition?

I know a lot of non-black (racist) people still use the word against black people - which i think is mostly down to the fact that they know it will trigger them and they want to be hurtful. Obviously that is very wrong and racist, i'm just hoping someday the culture will change, so we can either stop using the word all together, or all of us use the word in a friendly/greeting way - and even if used derogatively, it should be like calling someone an idiot or cunt or what ever.  
I know it hurts a lot more than to be called an idiot, but if we could somehow change that, then other races (mostly whites) wouldn't have 1 word to instantly hurt and trigger most black people.

For full disclosure i will add that me and my (white) friends sometimes call each other the n-word. I'm truthfully sorry if that offends anyone reading this. When we use the word, it is always as a replacement for ""mate"", ""buddy, ""bro"" etc.  
We only really use the word when chatting on discord when we game/chat with each other, and no black person is present. On the rare occasion we have played (and been on discord with) a black person without knowing this fact, and used the word, they have always (seemingly) been completely cool with it and mostly laughed at it - maybe because they could tell we didn't mean it in a negative way. This has only happened 5 times at most during several years.

I'm only adding this to be completely forthright, it might have an impact on my opinion - the sole fact that i use the word at all, since that makes me aware of my surroundings when used (although as i said, we would never use it in public), it is still in my vocabulary and sometimes naturally used to greet or address a friend).",True,False,False,,0,1561976883,,False,0,{},esh0jqk,False,t3_bswxvl,False,True,t3_bswxvl,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bswxvl/racism_megathread/esh0jqk/,False,,1571189391,3,True,[],False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,0,

Bride kidnapping, also known as bridenapping, marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, is a practice in which a man abducts the woman he wishes to marry. Bride kidnapping has been practiced around the world and throughout history. It continues to occur in countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus region, and parts of Africa, and among peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe.

In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime rather than a valid form of marriage.

If that's the case then I want England to leave the Union.  Forget Scotland.

What a bonkers argument.  We can't not implement anything because a minority don't want it.  Better not ban fox hunting because the country folk don't want it.  

Frankly, if the Scots can't accept that being in the Union will mean that they lose democratic votes then they should leave.

At least they get a vote though. We don't when it comes to what gets put up for EU law.

The mind blowing astonishingly bizarre contradiction here is that all the remainers support Scotland leaving.

*Even though all their arguments apply.*

* There can be no plan for how leaving is implemented until they have voted (eg the currency problem, the border - just use the NI solution lol)
* They are leaving an economically favourable position
* Leaving is massively expensive and complex
* Leaving will disrupt their lives for decades
* They will lose access to all the UK infrastructure and have no guarantee of joining the EU.  
* They are risking trade, job, revenue
* If they join the EU they will have to take the Euro and have the same risks that the small EU countries have.  Worked well for Greece, huh?  
*Fingers crossed Italy doesn't need the mother of all bailouts.  Amazing that some ""informed"" remainers don't appreciate how close the Euro was to going under in the 2008 financial meltdown.  


Somehow, all of these things are trivial for Scotland.  How rational of remainers.

It just makes no sense.  Unless it's just a childish response to losing.  That makes some sense as tragic as that is.  Let's pin the break up of the union on Brexit.  Fine.  Whatever.  I don't want it but it's their choice.

1. The end of their quest/search/journey (two times)
2. The end of Cylon resurrection/immortality (opening the way for true Cylon death)
3. The end of the human-cylon war (also two times)
4. The end of the cylon-civil-war
5. The end of the ""pure"" (Colonial) human race
6. The end of the ""pure"" (Colonial and 13th-tribe) Cylon races

This is the exact quote by the first-war Cylon hybrid:

""Kara Thrace will lead the human race to its end. She is the herald of the Apocalypse, the harbinger of death. They must not follow her.""

^(Here's a small contemporary blog analysis of that quote: https://ideas.4brad.com/cylon-god-and-his-prophecy)

The Rebel Basestar Cylon Hybrid also has a similar line:

""You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end. End of line.""

Note that the human race, as the colonial humans on the BSG fleet know it, does begin its ""end"" with its settlement on Earth^2.  They presumably breed and mix with:

1. The human-Cylon descendents of Helo and Athena (i.e. Hera and perhaps more)
2. The pre-existing primitive humans on Earth^2
3. Possibly other Colonial Cylon ""skinjobs""
4. Possibly other members of the ""Final Five"" (13th tribe Cylons)

This ""end"" could easily be interpreted as ""death"" - the ""death"" of the existing human race, but also as a ""rebirth"" into something new: a hybrid future.  There's a lot of symbolic parallels to this idea throughout the story:

1. Kara's death and rebirth
2. Roslin's death paving the way for a new future
3. The Galactica becoming a hybrid vessel
4. The alliance between humans and Cylons
5. Hera as the ultimate symbol of the hybrid future

A major part of Kara's story arc (highlighted in the episode where she dies), is the acceptance of death as something beautiful, and not to be feared.  Kara herself is a personification of this very concept of death and rebirth as something new, and perhaps better.  There are also similar themes echoed by other characters in the show: the idea that there is ""something beautiful between life and death"" (see D'Anna); the idea that parents need to die (death) before they can be replaced (reborn) by their children (the next iteration of a cycle that has all ""happened before""); etc. 

Finally, note that the source of the quote of Kara's destiny makes for an unreliable fortune teller.  This hybrid ""god"" was a member of a split-away faction of the original Cylons that (presumably) disagreed with the ""evolutionary path"" of the mainstream Cylons.  He had an inherent bias in seeking to maintain the ""purity"" of *his* line of Cylons and his own hybrid existence (which was described as a developmental dead end).  It seems quite obvious that he would view a different hybridization, and possibly ""corruption"" of the ""purity"" of the Cylon future in a more negative light.

I think the basestar hybrids are also similar evolutionary ""dead ends"" that would not be involved in the hybrid Cylon-human future that would develop on Earth^2.

I'd also point out that ""harbinger of death"" is itself quite ambiguous.  I could interpret it as simply being a title for Starbuck's role in the context of *having returned from the dead*.

&gt;It's like saying a prophecy that Christopher Columbus would lead humanity to it's destruction came true because the Spanish Empire doesn't exist anymore.

It's more like a prophecy foretelling the end of the Roman Empire, and then someone arguing that the Roman Empire lives on because European and American countries still owe so much to the linguistic, political, technological, and genetic influences of Roman.

No, you are. Considering you're talking about some kind of extreme right voting pattern, when our right wing parties have been decimated in the recent election, especially the nationalist Danish People's Party.

&gt;you are not talking to some dumb american who cant point denmark on a map

That is **exactly** what I am doing, judging by your comments.

&gt;for one there is a huge push for privatization and lowering taxes all over

Considering the fact that our right wing parties LOST the general election, that simply put, is a fucking lie. How dumb are you? Noone, **NOT A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY IN DENMARK** supports privatization of healthcare. It would instantly lead to 0% in all polls, as no Dane is dumb enough to want American healthcare when we have some of the best accessible healthcare in the world. Our right wing government has failed to lower taxes by any meaningful amount, and our new left wing government intends to raise them, **and was elected on that promise.**

&gt;again plenty of european countries will be a mini usa with garbage weather.

Denmark won't. As for the right wing rising in various impoverished shitholes in Eastern Europe - I literally couldn't care less. Scandinavia is the only part of the world that I would describe as being civilised. Pretty much everything else is a shithole, one way or another.

&gt;About denmark your ""left wingers"" are mirroring more and more of the alt right's talking points

No they're not. They've gone sensible on many immigration policies, but in all other aspects our left wing parties are just as left wing as they always have been. The idea that we should be feeding a bunch of migrants and refugees fleeing Americas imperialist wars is just dumb, and more and more left-wing parties are in agreement to this. Despite this, our new government has decided to take more refugees, although the numbers will still be low. In reality we should be sending them all to the USA, as well as leaving NATO and cutting all military ties with the US.

&gt;and that is why they won because danes wont vote for anyone who is not a racist

Jesus christ man, you must be one of those American ""liberals"" (which btw, is a really dumb term considering that you're not economically liberal at all), who wants to flood our nation with Islamic barbarians. Fuck off, SJW.

We don't have **a single** racist party in our parliament. The only racist party running for parliament, failed to be elected.

&gt;you have paludan as a legit politician with fans for fucks sake

And who didn't get elected, despite our extremely low election threshold. They failed, the far-right FAILED.

&gt;go brag to clueless americans bro, I know what is up in europe

No you don't, as I've just pointed out to you.

&gt;because you hate black and brown people that much

We prefer our own people, which is completely fair, considering that it was our own people who enabled us to be one of the best countries on the fucking planet, something that not a single african or middle eastern country has ever achieved, or even gotten close to achieving. We are simply superiour, not because of race, but because of culture, attitude and (the lack of) religion. And many Danes simply don't want people who are incompatible with our way of life, to be given access to this land of milk and honey - because they'll fucking poison it. Religion (and especially Islam) is a terrible, terrible thing.

So, tl;dr: We aren't moving to the right on any other issue than immigration (which, by the way, is the ONLY issue that we should be moving to the right on). Our left wing parties are stronger than ever, in part thanks to their more realistic stance on immigration. We are a homogeneous country, which is exclusively a benefit, and we wish to remain so. Multiculturalism is bad, Islam is bad, Denmark is good :)

While Pakistan didn't directly involve itself in the conflict, Pakistani military officers have nonetheless guided the Saudis throughout the war. What do you think Raheel Sharif is doing in Saudi Arabia? 

&gt;you can be sure Pak won't be getting involved in any conflict with Iran. 

Pakistan doesn't have to invade Iran. We could very well simply use proxies to target them in Iranian Balochistan 

&gt;doesn't hold much clout on the economic front either when it comes to Iran. 

Considering Iran is on the verge of being utterly destroyed by US sanctions, Pakistan being one of Iran's major neighbours does in fact have a great deal of influence. Why do you think Iran's been so interested in joining CPEC? 

&gt;Pakistans military cooperation with Saudi/Qatar/UAE pales into insignificance when you compare it to them and the US/Europe. Pakistans military does not have the sort of power projection capabilities that the US/Europe do. That said, are Pakistanis (including Pakistani origin individuals) embedded within/part of Saudi/Qatar/UAE armed forces, of course. But they would have still been there even if the Saudis/Qatar/UAE DIDN'T loan Pakistan &gt;$12 billion.

Pakistan's military cooperation paling in comparison to US/Europe doesn't mean it's irrelevant. In fact, you're completely ignoring the fact that US/Europe involvement is mostly tied to arms sales whilst Pakistan presence has to do more with military bases and officers directly training and assisting the Gulf Countries. 

Another thing you fail to consider is loyalty. The Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia, see loyalty when they see Pakistan because Pakistan's relations with the Saudis aren't solely tied to oil like it is with America and Europe. They've a much greater chance at actually developing a friendship with Pakistan than say.. with America or the EU (the latter which has already started ending military sales to Saudi Arabia due to civilian casualties in Yemen). Then to all of this, you add in Pakistan's nukes and it's a done deal

&gt;So again, Pakistan was loaned money for strategic reasons

It's hilarious how keep repeating strategic reasons but then fail to consider what it entails. What value do these ""strategic reasons"" except through one's military and economy? 

&gt;keep out of Irans sphere of influence

Keep out of Iran's sphere of influence? Pakistan within Iran's sphere? Lmao, are you okay? Might as well add in ""Pakistan should be out of Afghanistan's sphere"" 

&gt;and the Qataris

It's the same as earlier. Pakistan isn't within or even at risk of falling under Iran or Qatar's sphere of influence. Neither of those two countries are influential enough to push Pakistan into their spheres and with Qatar, I doubt if they've even got any ""sphere of influence"" outside of fringe proxy groups 

&gt;don't take sides in our issues with the UAE/Saudi and/or mediate on our behalf.

How can you say that when they signed onto the Tory austerity framework? I don't care if you say it was a less severe austerity. Austerity is still austerity.

Well it might be if I had actually said that.

&gt;Less tax coming in means less money to spend. Otherwise poor countries would just decide not to be poor any more.

Why are you going back to this again? You might not understand macroeconomics but that doesn't mean economists don't understand it. Austerity has been repeatedly discredited by economic research.

Dando eu o pontapé de saída, propunha ao SC jogarmos com o esquema base que ele utilizou com o Liverpool - 4x2x3x1. Laterais bem abertos e a subir, os médios mais recuados a arrastar o meio campo para a frente, os 3+1 da frente em trocas posicionais e a atacar a balizar. 

Para tal, investia prioritariamente num PL/Avançado (tipo Roger Guedes) e num novo extremo. Se sobrassem ainda alguns trocos e as jantaradas tivessem todas pagas, por fim, um guarda-redes. Daria algo como:

11 base:

Vaná (ou GR novo)

Alex Telles; Pepe; Diogo Leite/Diogo Queiróz; Saravia

Danilo; Sérgio Oliveira

Extremo; Oliver; Corona;

Avançado.

O resto:

12.Diogo Costa (taças)

13.Manafá - lateral para os dois lados;

14.Diogo Leite/Diogo Queiroz - 3º Central

15.Mbemba - 4º Central

16.Loum - rodar os médios defensivos;

17.Otávio - possibilidade de alterar o esquema jogando como extremo/médio central

18.Galeno - 1ª substituição no jogo para extremo

19.Aboubakar - avançado para quando fosse necessário jogos muito fisicos (há sempre aqueles campos fdds em janeiro/fevereriro com muita chuva)

20.Terceiro avançado.

Geria os ""miúdos"" como o Jesualdo referiu: treinar periodicamente com o plantel, tentar que fossem para o banco na taça da liga e quipa B. Teria o Tomás Esteves como o 4º lateral, o Fábio Silva como 4º avançado (suplente para taças da liga, por exemplo). Quanto ao Fábio Vieira e o Romário Baró, talvez assumisse que emprestaria um deles para rodar na Primeira Liga e o outro na B e podendo servir os A em caso de lesões.

Thats probably a question of the point of view to it; they might not have ""get things done"" but as we know as living under checks and balances: thats how things are if you really figure out which is the best step for everybody.

&gt;He centralized everything and made it under his control,

-&gt;erased it and became dictator

&gt;but at least they were working and not corrupted.

or rather 100% corrupted since bound to his arbitrary will for the good of himself and his family.

&gt;(not counting the ones that died of starvation or illness from epidemy)

well...the revolution started because of this and as we know: if things went to far there is no short way back

&gt; that would have happened (in way worse) if the first coalition would have invaded France..

which is a bad scenario, I'm with you, but since they didn't even planned to move into the field before France declared war on them (why should they? they were bitter rivals, and rivals with the king of france as well, they weren't even able to fight side by side when it would have made the difference to win instead of loosing: Austria wasn't jet able to forgive Prussia four lost wars, and Prussia had nothing, literally nothing else to win or loose there; having a constitution already and high support-rates it didn't really felt threatened by the revolution).

(EDIT The thing is: it ended exactly as if he never took over the Alps: France occupied. Its army slain. French soil abandoned. ""les enfants de la patrie"" dead.The woman windows. French economy wrecked. French independence gone. A King set on the throne by outer powers....i don't think loosing in first round would have been ore disastrous)


&gt;Yep he was clever enough to make come back those who had money and knowledge.

Not saying it was dump, just a mayor setback for equal rights and all that, literally everything positive about the revolution; this way it was just losses without gain. No freedom or progress from ancient regime left here.

&gt;His family members were indeed at the head of the freed states

oh, i remember when i was a child and the ""conquer this or that"" card in RISIKO got replaced with ""Free this and that "" cards, doesn't really matter

&gt;Absolutly false information, even wikipedia says that the newly states created by Napoléon were less authoritarian than the previous ones.

French Wickypedia possibly: never trust wickypedia on political controversial stuff: even the carnival at the Rhein got banned under french rule (which is why the animator groups march in caricatures of Prussian uniforms, even though some nowadays think it was to ""mock the oppressor"")

Oh, he was Brilliant in Propaganda which is why many welcomed him and expected great deal of freedom and stuff... ...you can read their anger few years later when they became his staunch enemies since he didn't brought the revolution but a setback to conditions which weren't the bad ever before, but people understand the better why among all the french had a revolution when it was said to have been even worse before.

The Most progressive became those states which managed to avoid his and his families direct rule, like Bavaria and Prussia.

&gt;Thanks to him, France went from totally fucked up country vowed to obliteration to an Empire ruling over almost all continental Europe.

Thanks to him the antimonarchist revolution was delayed another hundred years in which France had to recover from the losses he inflicted on his journey across euro, since a empire for a day is nothing but waste of resources.; and he couldn't hold a foot of land, so France ended worse of than ever before.


&gt;Thanks to him France was second behind England in manufacturing weapons

You know that till the threat of the blockade forcing to build up more production capacity England imported great deal of weapons from Prussia?...second...;)

Grantred, he did his best to cripple Prussia by giving mayor capacities to Bavaria, but still; dreams of supremacy and a giant production goods needed by the own military, (but still not sufficient as the end demonstrates, not even sufficient including systematic plundering of the occupied countries) is nothing positive but a complete disaster.

The main premise:

1. Regulations that restrict competition for the idea of protecting jobs have the actual effect of hurting Canadians. Canadian “capital” cannot leave our system. The idea that foreigners profit at our expense by extracting capital in a market trade system is impossible. [Background]
2. In regards to our discussion about Airlines - I want to set up a scenario where if I am wrong about previous statement about the Airlines then we should restrict and ban imports of fruits.
3. You’ve asked questions on why countries industry fails. My answer is this again is a failure of government.
4. Taxes would help. I agree with you, my issues is there is a bigger problem to solve.
5. You argue that Air Canada doesn’t have a monopoly because we have many smaller players.


You mentioned security. I just wanted to start off here about regulations that restrict competition actually hurt Canadians. You said it was a security issue, I would argue that it's precisely the opposite - that is Canadians are more secure. Canadians are more secure if foreigners who vote in another country like America or Europe have an economic self interest in maintaining the status quo, why would they impose restrictions on us or go to war if that could hurt there voting interests. Wars have happened in the past due to markets and products they cannot get, we are freely trading them at this point. 


[ You can ignore this part, as part of our discussion. This is part of the background from point 1.

There is a general failure of understanding economics in the general population and by politicians, everyone votes assuming they understand economics. The ideas of economics are very counter initiative to them. For example: The American rust belt being destroyed somehow hurt America. This is used in the media to show how trade hurts Americans. Many Americas benefited a great deal from the lower prices of vehicles. The upfront damage is shown but the large diffuse advantages at large of cheaper cars are not shown.

That is it is often thought to be a good thing if you are an exporter and a bad thing if you are an importer. 

We often invoke protectionism to maintain jobs here because the fear is those jobs are going to another country. 

Protectionism has impacting of saving jobs you can see at the greater expense of the economy at large because the silent jobs created by lower costs cannot be seen as they are spread over the economy.
]


I agree with you on American’s and European have those restrictions. 

By my general premises of 1. Just because they have those restrictions doesn’t mean we should. The main reason being that we would be less subject to government failures as I’m about to explain. We seriously benefit from “unequal free trade” as trade is never unequal, we are just exporting Canadian currency instead of goods and services. 

“If European and American carriers were able to establish healthy, competitive, and affordable air transportation industries without removing foreign ownership restrictions(in some cases being more restrictive than Canada currently is), then why on earth are you seeking to remove these restrictions domestically rather than simply following the proven successful model in these other countries?”

This is the general premises of 3. We have not talked about this yet. 

The answer: They can have those foreign restrictions if they don’t have a history of Government stepping and breaking the market. That is companies need to be allowed to succeed and fail from the very beginning. 

This requires a history of Air Canada. We did at one time we did have a private fleet. Air Canada was made as a crown corporation. It killed our private airlines business, that is healthy competition in your comparison. It was then made private but it could not run properly without assistance so it has had to be bailed out and ran at a loss. The government could not let this beast fail. They should have let them. 

Now you could say: Let that is all the past. They wanted to give it a chance running as a private company. The problem is that promising Canadian upstarts and knowledge have already been destroyed due to years of being a crown company and then running at loss when it was made private against competitors. They are desperately trying to compete. You could not compete at the transition if one company can run losses then get saved. Today startup costs of being is the airlines industry are much higher due to regulations and rules for ""safety."" Air Canada was using taxed funded to keep it alive. Now the airline business is very hard to get into as opposed to the past. As a Canadian it’s just easier to buy Air Canada stocks if you want a part of the Canadian airline business, because a failure of government has repeatedly allowed it to trip over itself and kill competition. Any money you spend on a new airline business would be better spent on the Air Canada stock because it’s a monopoly [I understand your point of saying it’s not a monopoly because we have smaller regional ones, that would also need an entire point] over the majority of high revenue flight path in current status quo.

You would need both capital startup required and knowledge. Air Canada has never had to compete domestically and worry about failures. It has learned from international flights, but no reason to make that work at home. A foreign airline would exactly fix the wrongs that the government created in the first place.

“Whether or not they are small players isn't really relevant. What routes they fly is.”

If we allowed foreign ownership this would begin to change our capital outflow to inflow allowing trade to increase. Meaning investments would be happening directly in our economy. Right now we are a net exporter of currency and one reason being that money has better returns outside of our country then inside, if we allowed foreign ownership we could actually see capital flow into our country to buy these Airlines and set up shop for development to create competition on the main market. Increasing trade and thus the wealth of Canadians. 

I don't agree that don't they have a monopoly. If continue, i'll talk more about this in another point as I understand it's key to your point of view. The point would be showing that jumping from a smaller to a higher tier one has been made more difficult over time. A simple example, and one you might consider bad is at Steve Jobs was able to make computers in a garage and sell them, over time the barrier to entry has gotten harder. 

Once again by my main premises number 1. We are never hurt by lower prices due to foreign lower prices, I would argue capital can be stolen by opposite a broken system that allowed an unnatural monoploy to form. I want flights like Toronto to Vancouver to be cheaper. I also don't believe Air Canada would fall quickly and jobs would be shifted. 

“high prices and fares”

I would agree with this too. If we lowered taxes it would help. It still would not get us to a free competitive market as our history of government interference and banning of foreign money to develop our market. The bailout of the airline if you look up the past. We also aren’t as capital rich as America or Europe and also just buying Air Canada stocks with it’s stranglehold on the market is better. You can get flights over very long distances in the USA and Europe for as low as 25-50. Just a history of very competitive forces has made them very cost efficient. 

“Right. None of this is problematic from an economic standpoint. When you ""switched over"" to a new proposal the economic issues present with the original proposal were dealt with.”

I did switch over because I did not want to get into things dealing with customs. At that point we’d be talking about cabbage laws, international laws, immigration laws and work permits. I wanted to get a basecase on competition. I actually still stand by those things, I think starting here is simpler then expanding. I wanted to work inside your rules to make my points it. 

The security point I wanted to put above.

“A couple of comments back you specifically stated that we wanted to be a net importer. I'm not sure why you're flip flopping on these positions - I didn't even argue against(or disagree) with your assertion that we want to be a net importer.”

I thought at some point you mentioned our profits from our Canadian flights would somehow be extracted and foreigners would profit at the expense of Canadians. I wanted to show this is not the case. If I have not shown that in the general condition (1) could say more. 

“We aren't ""propping up"" the Canadian airlines anymore than America or the EU are ""propping up"" theirs. It seems extremely clear to me that the higher costs in Canada's air transport industry are due to the comparatively high fees/taxes Canadian airlines are subject to rather than the lack of foreign investment.” 

I understand now why you have an issue with my Fruit Comparison to Air Lines. 

The reason being is that they had better and more fair markets from competition in the first place - as did we. They never had a market destruction of the nationalization of the airlines. That means they got really good at competing. Americans/Europe do not complain as much about price, however they too would benefit from more competition.

What is presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Every report I've ever read from a government study refutes Frum's statements. Even the ones from conservative thinktanks don't agree with him 100%.

If he included some citations; maybe it would be more effective. But he didn't. 

&gt;The Atlantic isn’t a two-bit publication

I actually like the Atlantic and I defend them a good publication regularly against conservatives who treat it like a liberal rag. It has a lot of objective material....which is almost always sourced in some way, form, or fashion.

&gt;almost all of their stories are heavily vetted before making it to print

Part of that vetting is hyperlinking to sources, which is entirely absent from Frum's article.

&gt;You literally don’t even refute any of them

A lot of what he says isn't worth refuting. It's simply his opinion. He argues that immigration is the reason for the rise of right wing populism in Europe and that stopping immigration will correct that. He completely ignores that these groups existed prior to immigration waves and will continue to do so afterwards. It's like blaming racism on black people; it's fucking stupid.

Frum argues that our immigration outlook is based on nostalgia and outdated. He might as well denounce all religions since their teachings are nothing more than nostalgia as well. He offers nothing more than his opinion here...

He quotes Clinton about immigration being a problem but offers no proof. Nowhere does he actually show that immigration is the problem and not archaic social attitudes and right wing neo-conservatism stirring the pot.

&gt;according to a 2016 survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic, nearly half of white working-class Americans agree with this statement: “Things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.”

He offers nothing to suggest this is due to immigration in the modern era. White, working class Americans didn't either. In my experience, they're just as likely to call a 5th generation Hispanic or a Native American an ""immigrant"" as an actual immigrant. Their fear is rooted in xenophobia; not immigration concerns.

Frum uses examples of how the broader European public wants less immigration but ignores that the broader US public wants the same amount or more (Pew data). He's trying to draw similarities between populations that don't share the same opinion on the matter.

I actually spent time reading up on it before I made my post. Every tribe actually given an origin story in 1 and 2 originates from a Vault. Arroyo is from Vault 13. Jackals, Vipers, and Khans are from Vault 15.

In NV, you have the Boomers from Vault 34, the Mormons from Vault 70, the Sorrows/Dead Horses/White Legs/80s who survived in Zion/Utah solely because House stopped the nukes falling in the Mojave area with his high tech missile shield, and that's all. The series tells us that in the rest of the world that wasn't the Mojave, people who didn't take shelter in Vaults, or incorrectly secured Vaults, died of radiation poisoning or turned into ghouls.

&gt;There are also military bunkers, company shelters and privately or community-owned and buildt shelters that can very well exist in other countries as well. The Swiss did build shelters a lot, and the Russians have their giant metro system in Moscow. 

Fallout's world is divergent by 1945, which means their Cold War and everything after it played out differently to ours. All of Europe is canonically impoverished in the 2060s so it doesn't matter if real-world Switzerland and Russia have good bomb shelters, because you need plenty of fuel and food spare and set aside if you want to be able to stock a bomb shelter that can run for hundreds of years. Europe did not have the food or fuel to spare.

&gt;So Europe was well enough in 2077 to have tourists visitin the U.S.

Conversely, you solely attack Islam while overlooking religious violence by Buddhists and Hindus against Islamic and Christian communities.

&gt;**genocide, as prescribed by Islamic scripture**

This is completely false, and extremely dividing and Islamophobic. Recognise that the more that you validate the [""clash of civilisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations)"" US propaganda feat, the more you push the Muslim World further towards extremism as they feel cornered by the seemingly unstoppable march of American consumerism and plutocratic democracy (neither of which benefit Europe in the slightest) as the globally accepted norm. Islam does not endorse genocide or the destruction of the West. The US and its lackeys present you with the worldview that the Islamic World is one monolithic civilisation which is against everything we stand for and that has essentially declared war on us. This is anything but a case of an *""either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists""* scenario.

In fact, across the Middle East, the United States has destroyed the bulwarks of secularism (Tunisia, Libya, Syria) through disasterous ""regime-change"" wars and colour revolutions backed by Turkey, Qatar and the other Gulf monarchies (the truly despotic Islamist states) as well as the Zionist settler-colonialist state and the Muslim Brotherhood. Even now, the Free Syrian Army is in a de-facto alliance with al-Nusra, backed by al-Qaeda. None of this is speculation, it's verified fact.

&gt;**defend China in light of the Uygur situation**

As for the Uyghur issue, I accept that there are legitimate concerns regarding re-education facilities in China and that quality of life in many of the institutions is below what we expect as international observers, and dialogue is certainly needed with China on this issue. Europe, as a part of a free and multipolar world with strong international institutions that are no longer mere instruments of US power projection worldwide, would play a key part in this.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that the people attending these facilties have often been referred to them by trusted members of their community after flirting with extremist (and sometimes terroristic) ideas. In order to preserve China's stability, peace and secular government, they clearly need to employ a wide-ranging counter-insurgency strategy that targets the cultural disillusionment at the core of the rise of Islamist sentiment in Xinjiang Province (which has been Chinese since 60 BCE), rather than simply adopting the American policy of going in and [""bombing the sh\*t](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2015/11/12/trump-i-d-bomb-the-s-t-out-of-isis)"" out of the terrorists with no concern as to the underlying causes of unrest. Education can address these issues, but must do so in a moderately more nuanced way than that of the policies employed by China today.

&gt;**huge federated states**

Nice Eurosceptic dogwhistle.

In **summary**, I am a secularist but I believe strongly in self-determination for all peoples. The secular path likely to be taken by a Middle East devoid of American-Zionist-Wahhabist interference would be a favourable one to Europe, and MENA would serve as a confluence of Europe, Africa and Asia, but a fiercely independent one nonetheless.

The plat gets you access to the Amex Centurion lounges.  SFO is already one of better ones, though crowded, and they're slated to finish the LAX lounge Q3 2019.  Plus, the 5x points on booking flights lets you save up points for an international trip in business/first class if you transfer points to partnering airlines.  The dream, of course, would be an ANA round-the-world ticket.  We're looking at 120k points for economy, 170k for business, and 260k for first class.  You can read the details online, but basically you pick a direction and fly around the world.

On the topic of hotel discounts, Amex frequently has hotel offers on the card, which are usually about 20% cashback.  Right now I have:

 * $100 off $500 or more at Hilton in Europe
 * $60 off $300 or more at Kimpton Hotels
 * $50 off $250 or more at Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts
 * $40 off $200 or more at Caesars Entertainment in Vegas
 * $75 off $200 or more at Hyatt Place and Hyatt House
 * $100 off $500 or more at MGM resorts
 * $60 off $300 or more at select MGM resorts

Hotel upgrades are a function of loyalty programs.  The plat gets you in to Marriott and Hilton at gold level.  As long as you hold the card, your status will never drop below gold.  Marriott Bonvoy offers room upgrades, but being upgraded to a suite requires Platinum or higher.  That said, there are data points of people getting a suite with Gold.  Hilton likewise requires Diamond status to get upgraded to a suite.  Outside of the membership perks, the Hotel Collection and FHR program offers a space-available room upgrade at check-in.  I've never used the HC program, only the FHR program, so I can't speak about HC.  But FHR basically upgrades you to whatever room they feel like giving you.  Sometimes that means no upgrade, because the hotel is sold out on all the rooms they are willing to upgrade you to.  Sometimes this means that, ""Hey, no one is staying in the best suite in the hotel, you can have that one"".

They were not your typical native tribe. Reportedly very tall and widely known to be fierce warriors. They are often claimed to have been cannibals, but this was likely fear-mongering by Europeans and Americans. In fact, when Cabeza de Vaca and his shipmates washed ashore, they stayed on the beach for awhile trying to recover and survive. They *did* resort to cannibalism out of necessity, however when the Karankawa found them and saw this, their first reaction was to start weeping. It is possible they practiced a ritualistic cannibalism with their enemies after battles, but this was a widespread practice across many tribes, not a staple of their diet by any means.

Edit: come to think (been a few years since I've studied this in depth), actually I think it was the case that the natives *didn't* see the sailor's cannibalism, which de Vaca was grateful for as this was feared to persuade them to kill them all. They wept just at the pitiable state they were in. Also, he subsequently lived with them for several years and never mentions any cannibalism. All of which strengthens the case that it was either nonexistent or very rare.

I think personally we should have had a clean break no deal brexit and spent the negotiation time instead preparing the country as much as we could to soften the blow.

The negotiation was never going to be a success because of remain and leave. Remain would not support any deal or actively help to make one, because to do so is to accept the result (which they haven’t and never will.). Likewise, leave would never have supported or actively helped to make a deal because they see any deal as diluting leaving, as maintaining some kind of tie to the project which can be used to push us back in at a later date.

So the whole “brexit” situation has been less about the EU vs UK and more just a continuation of the referendum. Barnier has frankly been irrelevant to the entire process, it was an internal British political scrap.

it's hard. because as an iranian, i can 100% guarantee you that their shitty government is not to be trusted as far as they can be thrown. the instant you make some sort of ""deal"" with iran, they **will** go back on it because the people in charge (of running what was once a beautiful country) are completely corrupt, garabage fires and murderers. their word counts for nothing. they also won't lash out to the USA because their government knows we outclass them - so they make their empty threats but that's all it is imo.

&gt;Wack story. America is not even remotely close to as diverse adms Europe. That's all OP is referring to. America has ethically Segragated communities and that's as much diverse as it gets here. **The most diverse places are big cities like NY, LA, SF, etc. Rest of country is filled with Trumpeters.** (Emphasis mine)

&amp;#x200B;

and not OP. I am not trying to prove that one (Europe or America) is more than the other, I am trying to show that even obscure cities in the United States are more diverse (however you may want to define that) than that this person is claiming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree with your point that it's impossible to truly measure cultural diversity, I never insinuated that it was possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So, is the cultural diversity in the US due to larger economic inequality than in Europe (I assume that there is more economic equality in the US, but I have no proof of that) where people move to another ""culture"" if they happen to get rich, while the European diversity is more agnostic about the economic situation of the people and more of their background?

I don't think it's that simple to tie cultural diversity simply to economics or place it largely on one outcome. I think its always multitude of factors (neighborhood/location, economic, racial, religious, etc.).I agree that it's almost impossible to boil down a person's diversity level to a single identifying marker, but  I have difficulty believing that people's own ""subjective"" ethnic identification is somehow a disqualification. Of course it's a simplification, and they do tend to show an imperfect comparison, but since they are both measurements of ethnicity, I find them flawed but still usable. You have provided no reason beyond opinion to disqualify census numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

But I do believe that using the socially constructed ethnic/racial groups in the US (Black, white) is equally valid as identifying ethnic Germans or ethnic Hungarians, given the long history of racism in the United States that permeates cultural differences to this day. I believe that trying to differentiate between what is more different is impossible. Diversity, as it applies to humans, is a completely subjective and artificial designation. It's impossible to truly measure because it simplifies a whole host of factors amongst people to attempt some form of measurement between categorical differences. It gives very little weight as to how big those differences are and only identifies if differences exist at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Given how every level of how diversity is often measured, ethnicity is a simple and effective tool at getting to that point. It's imperfect, but it at least allows for some point of reference. A more effective analysis would look at  linguistic, religious, sexual orientation, economic, age, gender, political belief diversity. Then it would weigh them in some manner to show the relative difference between them and then assign some kind of score.

NBA is fucking over continental basketball every offseason since 2015. 

12 years ago NBA cap was slightly over 50 million USD. Now it's breaking into double of that. 12 years ago Eurobball clubs' budgets were the exactly the same they are today. And with 2-way contracts, 60 additional player spots were added to the NBA.

With this pace, NBA will have another big cap increase in 2025 and EuroLeague clubs will still operate on same budgets which will be the practical death of continental basketball.

NBA has certain rules, structure and tradition that they should have the best players in the world. Frankly, if the top of the top players were to come to Europe, they would not be maximised here due to Eurobball's own rules, structure and tradition which all constitutes an extremely different game on&amp;off the court than the NBA. The issue is NBA has started to steal away tons of players that would be better maximised here, most of them don't even play in the NBA.

Other societies such as those of Japan, South Korea or Switzerland employ a very indirect way of talking. Both methods are equally efficient and successful as long as all participants know the cultural context. Problems (misunderstandings) only arise when people from two cultures with vastly different modes of communication meet and aren't aware of the disparity. For example Americans among themselves usually understand each other without problems and Japanese people among themselves also know what the other person is saying but if an American travels to Japan and speaks the same way there as he does at home, chances are the Japanese will turn away and think he's extremely rude while the American will be perplexed by how ""unclear"" the Japanese are expressing themselves. Similar situations happen when Germans (or other people like that) come to Switzerland and aren't aware of the cultural difference.

And yes, screaming in public is viewed as rude here. But to be fair, this is the case for most of Europe. Americans are generally considered annoyingly loud in Europe.

&gt; European leaders have resisted calls to start reimposing sanctions on Iran after the country said it had for the first time broken the terms of the nuclear deal it signed with foreign powers in 2015.

&gt; European leaders had urged Iran not to breach the deal, but the focus may now be on dissuading Iran from taking further, more serious steps away from the terms.

&gt; Iran previously has enriched to 20%. At a meeting with Iran in Vienna last Friday, the EU announced it had set up its long planned EU-Iran trading mechanism, Instex, and said the first transactions had been completed.

My reference to truth was not meant in the ""true justified belief"" sense. Truth as the description of a beliefs relationship or accordance with reality, as you said.   


If we want to speak in terms of academic philosophy when I say ""objective truth"" I'm referring to the noumenon.   


Also I'm not arguing for [absolute morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism). I'm arguing for [moral realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism).    


My argument begins with an assumption of moral realism as a premise. If you disagree then we can discuss that as a separate issue.   


But what I'm arguing is that all in all, most people's moral frameworks don't actually differ all that much, what fundamentally differs is people's understanding of reality itself.   


Case in point:    


Nazis believed that the Holocaust was justified because inferior peoples were propagating out of control and leading to a degeneration of society.   


These beliefs were formed through the material realities surrounding the German people and Europeans in general. The industrial revolution, the rapid urbanization and rampant crime and squalor, the increase in inequality, the expansion of globalization, and the atomization of local and traditional communities etc etc.   


They were correct in identifying there being issues with the modern capitalist paradigm but they interpreted it through an ontological schema which identified the source of the problem as being ""degeneracy"" rather than recognizing the systemic nature of capitalism and technology. They based their beliefs on [anthropological theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race#19th-century_physical_anthropology) , and [biological theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Origins_of_scientific_racism) which had no merit.   


IF there were in fact an out of control propagation of inferior peoples directly leading to the destruction and dissolution of human society, then YES it would make sense to try to reform, kill, or control such people. This is in fact the same argument that is made by democratic societies when they lock up people for breaking the law, and by communist societies when they create ""re education camps"".   


Nazis and racists are immoral but they're immoral largely because their worldview is fundamentally based on falsehoods.  


When one engages with Nazi rhetoric on a purely moral schema level you ultimately do your argument a disservice by ceding their greatest weakness. The fact that they are factually wrong about their premises.   


It can seem easier to argue the issue on moral schema because moral schema seems so wishy washy. There are dozens of competing theories of how to best formulate morality. I take the view of [GE Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy#Moore's_discussion) that most of these are fundamentally misled because they are attempting to reduce the irreducible. Fundamentally... most moral schema come to pretty similar conclusions *as long as* they are also operating under the same worldview of how reality is and works.",False,False,False,,0,1562008183,,False,0,{},esi7brx,False,t3_c7r29b,False,True,t1_esi10r1,/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/c7r29b/friendly_reminder/esi7brx/,False,,1571209674,1,True,[],False,ChapoTrapHouse,t5_3ezs3,r/ChapoTrapHouse,public,0,

He's been doing all the talking about ""tackling the child abuse issues"" and had been ""admitting"" that it exists in the Church throughout his tenure, but no real steps have been taken that the outside world considered concrete and effective in getting the guilty charged and punished.

Here are some the steps that are considered major in the eye of the church and its followers, and IT IS LAUGHABLE:

I'll add the ones you already mentioned:

* actively attempt to restore people's faith in the church by admitting that the church covered up a BUNCH of misconduct for decades.
* being a true Christian by exposing the church's flaws, asking for forgiveness while attempting to correct their mistakes.

____________

* He asked young children who are about to be abused to remind the priests that they are going wayward!

&gt; Pope: ""if you see a priest at risk, because he has lost the joy of his ministry, or seeks affective compensation, or is taking the wrong path, remind him of his commitment to God and his people, remind him of the Gospel and urge him to hold to his course.""

&gt; Francesco Zanardi, an Italian survivor of clergy sex abuse and president of the Abuse Network, said Francis’s guidance to young people - asking them to help wayward priests - went against ""every prevention protocol"" and indicated that the pope wants abuse to be handled internally.

&gt; ""Prevention means reporting and making it public,” Zanardi said. “You can’t just remind [a priest] of his Christian values. What will a pedophile think? ‘Wow, I got lucky.’ ""

________

* Performing a ""powerful"" mea culpa, making forceful statements, pressuring child abusers to resign. Much concrete! Wow!

&gt; January - he took a trip to Chile and ended up embroiled in a scandal where he was defending a bishop who had been accused of covering up sexual abuse.

&gt; After he botched the affair in Chile, he did admit his mistakes, and he made a very powerful mea culpa. And over the year, he has made many forceful statements against predator priests. He's also pressured several bishops to resign. He's talked the talk, but many abuse survivors say he hasn't sufficiently delivered.

ZURICH.- El presidente Mauricio Macri recibió hoy en su visita a Suiza el premio ""Living Football Award"", primera edición de un reconocimiento que la FIFA entrega a las personalidades destacadas del mundo por las acciones que han liderado para el desarrollo del fútbol y el sostenimiento de los valores del deporte como vehículo para el crecimiento de las sociedades. ""En este mundo que necesita del diálogo, el fútbol tiene que ser el puente para lograr ese diálogo que derribe las barreras. El fútbol refleja la cultura de cada nación"", subrayó Macri, en un acto realizado en la sede de la FIFA. El presidente fue acompañado por Gianni Infantino, responsable de la FIFA, y Alejandro Domínguez, el titular de la Conmebol.

Macri puntualizó que ""el futbol ha sido una escuela"", que le ha dado ""momentos increíbles e inolvidables"" y afirmó que ""la pasión crece más cuando uno pierde que cuando gana porque siempre se quiere revancha"". Recalcó que se considera un ""fanático del fútbol desde muy chico"" y recordó que ya desde adolescente abrazó la idea de convertirse en presidente de Boca, cuando se dio cuenta de que no iba a poder ser ""el 9"" del xeneize.

""Hay que profesionalizar la conducción, apostar por los talentos y saber transmitir una mentalidad ganadora, la marca y la identidad del club para sumar a los jóvenes"", añadió.

En tanto, Infantino remarcó que Living Football ""es algo que nos habla al corazón, una manera de vivir el futbol"" y que el premio busca reconocer a las personas que ""hacen mucho"" por el deporte. ""Por eso decidimos entregar a Macri por primera vez este premio, especialmente por el respeto que se ganó en el mundo y no sólo por sus títulos conquistados"", destacó.

En ese sentido, subrayó que, ""como presidente de la Argentina, está escribiendo la historia con el acuerdo entre el Mercosur y la Unión Europea"" y aseguró que por ese histórico logro ""van a llegar más reconocimientos"".

Por su parte, Domínguez sostuvo que la distinción marca ""un momento histórico para Macri, la Argentina y fútbol mundial"". ""Hablar de Macri se puede resumir con los títulos que ganó. Convirtió a Boca es un ejemplo de lo que es creer en grande, lo llevó a la cúspide y contribuyó al crecimiento del fútbol mundial"", puntualizó.

The only way we're going to succeed in Europe is within the EU. We're never going to get things 100% our way 100% of the time, compromise is the aim of the game within the EU. Which i think is something that our government has failed to understand in the negotiations with the EU.

Needless to say, this uprising was suppressed, reportedly without violence, by the Czech legions, which were the closest thing Czechoslovakia had to an organized army. Relations were complicated from Day 1.

The German ""minority"" (which accounted for over 3 million people, the Czech population was barely twice that size for comparison) actually enjoyed decent political representation and economical sovereignty during the First Republic. The demographic was just about as varied as the Czech one, and there were Germans from the worker class all the way to the upper, landowners and industrialists included.

The Czechoslovak Republic was built and governed in such a way to benefit the Czech population first and other populations second. Despite this, out of all the minorities, the Germans enjoyed the biggest privilege, arguably even more than the Slovaks for example, though that is debatable. German institutions, schools and language weren't exactly promoted by the national government on a grand scale, but weren't suppressed either. Due to the uneven distribution and the prevalence of Germans in the border areas, it wasn't hard for Germans to find a prevalently German-speaking environment and sort of have ""their own place"" within the republic.

From the beginning, most German voters were distributed between the DSAP (German Social Democrats), DCVP (German Christian Social People's Party), BdL (German Farmers' League) and DNSAP (German National Socialists - disclaimer that national socialists =/= nazis). Most of these parties found representation through cooperating with their Czech equivalents, the DSAP cooperated with the Czech Social Democrats, BdL cooperated with the RZSML (Czech Agrarians) and so on. By a rule of thumb the German parties usually had 50-25% of the seats of their Czech equivalents and so played a decent part in their respective coalitions.

While there always were some tensions, they were far from a boiling point and apart from the language barrier, Czechs and Germans got along fairly well.

And then 1933 came. And Hitler came to power. And the Sudetendeutsche Party was created. Oh god. Oh fuck.

As one would expect, the nazis had a polarising effect on the German population in Czechoslovakia through this proxy party of SdP. Its mere existence threw a giant wrench into any prexisting harmony there was between Czech and German parties. In 1935, the SdP has **fucking won the national elections** (by a plurality). As in, they got more votes than any other Czech or German party in the whole fucking country. Keep in mind that the German, not necessarily voter population, counted around 3,5 million people, while the SdP received 1,2 million votes (!!!).

From this point on, things went south. When 1938 rolled in and the Sudetenland crisis came, you had SdP freikorps and other nazi-funded paramilitary groups conducting raids, sabotages and attacks on Czech military and law enforcement installations, including customs offices and barracks. A special volunteer home defence organisation had to be created by the national government, that's how much the government was scared of this looming threat. If a war were to break out, there would be 2 fronts - the one on the German border and the other everywhere between that and Prague. Things GOT HOT.

In October 1938, Sudetenland got annexed and SdP got absorbed into NSDAP. The Czechoslovak government subsequently plummeted into absolute panic and a single-party authoritarian state became to form over the couple of following months, with a government desperately trying to stall for time and trying to keep the Czech populace calm while knowing all too well a full-on annexation is coming. And it came, in 1939.

&gt; # [El acuerdo Mercosur - UE es ""fake"" | Algo falso que no es lo que aparenta](https://images.pagina12.com.ar/styles/focal_16_9_960x540/public/media/articles/3131/macri.jpg?itok=GwTcrwha)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; No se conoce la letra chica del acuerdo Mercosur - Unión Europea. Los principales afectados, a favor y en contra, no fueron consultados. Funcionarios del gobierno dicen que recién ahora se reunirán con ellos para comentarles de qué se trata lo que se firmó en Bruselas. Un Gobierno que se jacta de la apertura al diálogo y al consenso avanzó en una negociación, dominada por el secretismo, que puede definir la matriz productiva del país ignorando la opinión de industriales y de trabajadores de sectores sensibles.
&gt; 
&gt; Este comportamiento se entiende en la firme convicción del presidente Mauricio Macri de que la industria argentina es vetusta, como se lo ha dicho a varios de los principales dueños de grandes firmas productoras de manufacturas, y, por lo tanto, no merece ser considerada como prioritaria. Un desprecio que mezcla ignorancia acerca de cómo se han desarrollado los países y una rivalidad no resuelta con su padre industrial. Franco ha fallecido; ahora le toca el turno de terminar con la industria y le será más aliviador a él si en primer lugar se encuentra la automotriz, donde el grupo Macri fue uno de sus protagonistas con Sevel (Franco echó al hijo Mauricio de esa empresa por la escasa habilidad que demostraba en la administración del negocio). Por lo pronto, ese objetivo ya lo está cumpliendo porque el sector está siendo destruido en sus años de gobierno.
&gt; 
&gt; Otro motivo para explicar ese acuerdo es que la administración macrista responde a los intereses de los jugadores más grandes del agronegocio, quienes parecen ser inicialmente beneficiados del acuerdo con la UE. Uno de los máximos representantes de esa actividad, Gustavo Grobocopatel, actuó de vocero de ese grupo con una militancia fanática a favor del macrismo.
&gt; 
&gt; Se debe sumar una razón más rústica y de cortísimo plazo: aplicar un golpe de marketing político con el objetivo de tener algo para mostrar en estos meses de elecciones en un frente que ha acumulado una sucesión de fiascos estrepitosos en estos tres años y medio de economía macrista. Esto último ha quedado tan en evidencia que resulta grosera la repetición de eslóganes difundidos por la red de propaganda pública y privada acerca del carácter histórico de un acuerdo que no se firmó.
&gt; 
&gt; La grey de economistas liberales deberían ser más prudentes en festejar el anuncio del Gobierno si después no quieren quedar asociados al fracaso de otro experimento neoliberal, como pasó durante la gestión de Alfredo Martínez de Hoz en la última dictadura militar y de Domingo Cavallo durante el menemismo. Si es por la bandera ideológica del libre comercio les servirá para un debate económico que atrasa un siglo; pero si tienen la expectativa de que existe un acuerdo ya sellado se chocarán otra vez contra el muro del marketing político del oficialismo.
&gt; 
&gt; El macrismo, siendo fiel a su esencia, presentó una instancia de la negociación como si fuera un hito histórico, cuando en realidad no se firmó el acuerdo, sino que se definieron líneas generales. Condiciones que, también respondiendo a la naturaleza de la Alianza Cambiemos, benefician en exceso a la contraparte (a los europeos) con la ilusoria esperanza de conseguir la simpatía de capitales extranjeros para invertir en el país.
&gt; 
&gt; Uno de los negociadores del acuerdo Mercosur-Unión Europea en el gobierno anterior, Carlos Bianco, ex secretario de Relaciones Económicas de la Cancillería, ilustró con un ejemplo “el desastre” -como lo calificó- de lo pactado, en El Destape radio. En 2004, el Mercosur pidió que la Unión Europea autorizara el ingreso de 400 mil toneladas de carne; la contraoferta fue 100 mil toneladas. En 2010, sin avances en ese punto, se definió que ninguna oferta europea posterior podía ser inferior a esas 100 mil toneladas. De acuerdo a lo que se difundió, el Mercosur ahora aceptó 99 mil toneladas. No sólo no subieron la cuota, sino que es menor al mínimo ya establecido. Bianco reveló que conversó con uno de los negociadores argentinos y que él le dijo que había que cerrar el acuerdo porque “lo dicen de arriba (se refiere a Macri) para hacer el anuncio” para las elecciones.
&gt; 
&gt; Las “_fake news_” se emiten con la intención deliberada de engañar, inducir a error, manipular, desprestigiar para obtener un rédito económico o político. El anuncio del acuerdo Mercosur-UE realizado por el macrismo se encuadra en la definición de _fake_: algo falso que no es lo que aparenta. No es un acuerdo final; la letra chica no se definió; lo que se avanzó se mantiene en secreto; es un anuncio político en tiempos de campaña electoral; no tiene beneficios generales para la economía argentina; aumentarán las importaciones y disminuirán las exportaciones porque se perderá el mercado brasileño a manos de los europeos.

Again, terrible reasoning. The reasons for people's residency in countries are largely out of their hands. It relies on a variety of political, social, and economic reasons. 

For instance, Chinese emmigration relative to its population is quite small. Using your terrible logic, you could say their restrictive policies and authoritarian policies are somehow justified, demanded by the majority, or morally superior. Terrible reasoning.

&gt;I'm not usually in favor of absolutist policies for anything.

There are limits to speech in the US. They don't pertain to things so pathetic as policing insults. Imagine pathetic governments combing through people's Twitter accounts, waiting to jail people for the equivalent of being a playground bully. This is not freedom nor is it the responsibility of government.

&gt;It's reasonable to allow judges to not allow people to advocate that African Americans be sent to death camps or whatever. 

It is also apparently reasonable to censor comedians, jail those who criticize religion, and arrest people for making a joke with their dog. Once you grant the power to censor people for ""offensive behavior"" you grant the stupidest nonsense.

&gt;reasonable amounts of free speech you will have.

""Reasonable speech"" goes with ""reasonable"" human rights or ""reasonable"" freedom. It is a laughable phrase that sounds like it should be coming out of the mouth of a Saddam or a Gaddafi.

&gt;As long as democracy is in effect and the people want there to be reasonable amounts of free speech, reasonable amounts of free speech you will have. And if there's a dictatorship, or the people don't want to allow reasonable amounts of free speech, well, sooner or later you're not going to have reasonable amounts of free speech regardless what any constitution says.

Yes, and one of the great things about the American system is that it adjusts for the tyranny of the majority and grants fundamental human freedoms for everyone and doesn't leave it up to a majority vote.

&gt;See paradox of tolerance. If you're entirely tolerant of everything, that means being tolerant of people who want to establish a dictatorship. Being allowed in the public square gives them a chance to succeed, with demogogery and so forth. If they succeed, they tolerate nothing. So instead of almost all free speech being allowed, you have no free speech being allowed.

**The British Isles**

Great Britain has too many religions which aren't fleshed out. If it was a battle between four religions which all have some sort of defensive bonus (e.g. decisions to call troops in religious defensive wars) it would be fine, but currently that's not the case. My idea would be the following:

Have a syncretic religion of the former Greater London area. If you want to insult the British make every county outside of this area tribal. Make it a tolerant mishmash of non-Christian religions found in the area currently. A sort of mix between Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism.

Most of the rest of England could be Anglican including Canterbury, the current seat of the archbishop of the Anglican church. Maybe give some credit by making the Queen a sort of Mary-esque figure, the saint of the British isles.

Most of the rest of Britain should be a sort of Druidic nature worship. This is different from simply returning to old gods instead they reinvent nature worship and directly pray to the various names of wind, rain, earth or forest. Use Gaelic names to make them more mysterious. 

On the west coast of Ireland catholic provinces and realms should exist who have managed to weather the storm of the apocalypse.

**Catholicism**

Moving on to the mainland and talking about Catholicism and Polish Catholicism. I think the current split should be differentiated. I would split Catholicism between a more rigid and more ""liberal"" version. What does this mean? I would suggest that Poland, Southern France and parts of Italy follow a sort of inverse Franciscan Catholicism with a crowned Pope for both versions. Subjecting the enemy faction to restore theological unity could be a good goal for the early to midgame for the faithful and unity would unlock new abilities to rally for a crusade for example.

**Lutheranism and Deism**

I personally dislike the trope of the returning viking gods, especially coopting Lutheranism for it. What I would suggest is making Lutheran a tolerated heretical Christian with the Patriach feature. It would fit the style and breathe some life into an otherwise boring trope.

Deism is too boring. The Jain-like features only make sense in a peaceful environment. I would suggest the following. Dissolve the religion, add southern Finland to Lutheranism and give the Baltics a new religion. Make it a raiding religion, very commercial and very amoral. It should be a backstab fest and terrify neighbours. Maybe give it even coastal Poland.

**Black Forest, Atomist, Mountain Gods, Basque and Chavs**

The religions should simply be removed.

**Political and Philosophic Religions**

The cult of Reason and the Europeanism should be merged and mystified. First up this merger lead to more gameplay. Brussels could be the centre of a unique system, neither HRE nor ERE. The core lands could be the vestiges of a post-deluge empire, the core lands are ruled by a council president while all europeanist rulers swear tribute to them as semi-autonomous vassals. The religion itself would be a mix of different religions and ideas to choose from. Secularised Christianity could be an option to choose from. The Cult of Reason should be a heresy.

Soviet should have its name changed and be a collectivist unreformed folk religion. To make this obvious maybe change it so that they have access to a special government type, which makes their standard feudal primary holdings cities.

**Hellenism**

The story should be changed so the Greeks were forced to raid after the deluge to survive and have acquired a tradition of seafaring this way. This would make it possible to conquer new colonies and also reason the changes to Hellenism I propose. After the raiding habits of the southern Greeks turned worse a sacking of Mount Athos broke the camels back and the surviving Orthodox clergy denounced the Greeks. The Greek church in turn declared themselves independent and now it is a maritime version of Orthodoxy in which the sea plays a major role. It is still considered a heresy and has buffs, but if it is ever conquered it will be deactivated as a valid belief destroying the papacy and force converting all remaining believers.

I think these changes would make the mod much more unique and interesting.

It was the eastern Germanic tribes who favoured mounted warfare, the Ostrogoths and Vandals in particular were noted for their extensive use of cavalry. The Lombards picked up mounted warfare on a larger scale as they swept into Northern Italy abosorbing Gothic remnants and pushing back the Byzantines.

I went through a phase of intense saving and then backed off a bit over the period of 8 months or so.  To be frank it was one of the most life-changing phases of my life, especially since at the beginning I got a job that paid me more money than I previously would have known what to do with.

&amp;#x200B;

My recommendation is to think about your finances more in terms of priorities.  For me, I like tinkering with servers, exploring eastern Europe, sailing on the weekends and knowing I have enough money in the bank to leave a job I don't like (it came in handy when I left that high paying job because my boss and team were toxic).

To either ""live it up"" or save and ""not live"" is a total cop-out.  Spend enough to do what you like, but don't waste your money on things you don't really enjoy.  It's that simple.  Although, everyone takes a different amount of time to understand where their current priorities are.

&amp;#x200B;

Spending all your money and living a life of fear over creditors and debt collectors is no way to live your life.  For now enjoy your health and take this moment in your life to think deeply about what makes you happy and what that would mean in moderation.

Yes, there is a point at which you stop worrying about coalitions, and that point will get earlier and earlier as you get more experienced in EU4. The first general way to deal with coalitions is to prevent them from forming. Your allies get a heavy penalty to any AE you would accrue against them, so strategically allying large powers in the next area you intend to go on a warpath through is a good way to keep your coalitions manageable or too small to form in the first place. Also, anyone whose relation with you is greater than 0 will never become outraged no matter how much AE you have against them (although the instant they hit -1 they will flip to outraged, so be careful) so by using diplomats you can drastically increase the amount of AE you can generate in an area before coalitions begin forming. In general, if you want to hyper-blob, your best bet is to conquer the world one religion at a time; if you go on a warpath through Europe and every Christian nation is outraged towards you, the Islamic world still won't care, so pick a religion and unify it by the sword.

&amp;#x200B;

The second general way to deal with coalitions is to aggressively attack them. Nobody who has an active truce with you counts as a potential coalition member, so if you have 25 outraged countries and 23 of them are in a truce with you, a coalition cannot form. This is the strongest (and most difficult) way to deal with AE. You can, for example, rampage through the muslim world with no practical limits as long as you are willing to be in a truce or in a war with every single Islamic country in the game at all times. Alternatively, you can just let the coalition form, coalitions aren't as scary as new players think they are. The biggest thing is that you HAVE to attack the coalition, instead of letting them declare a punitive war against you, because punitive wars have a big negative modifier to the war leader's desire for peace that will make it incredibly difficult for you to end the war. If you attack into a coalition (and choose one of the smaller countries involved, who you can stackwipe and fully occupy quickly) you can then pick up just a little bit of warscore from occupations or battles and white-peace the entire coalition out, putting them all in truce and freeing yourself up for more wanton conquest. The downside of this is that the coalition will generally reform in 5 years when the truce is up, and you cannot declare more than 1 war per month so you will only be able to separately attack 1 or 2 of the original coalition members before it has fully reformed. One way around this is to allow the coalition to partially reform before attacking it again, splitting the coalition into separate truce timers. Another way is to attack an ally of one of your coalition members, and add that member as a co-belligerent; this will circumvent the inability to separate peace coalition members and allow you to put every single member of your coalition on a separate truce (try to space them all at least 1 month apart).",True,False,False,,0,1562019371,,False,0,{},esish6q,False,t3_c7s9wr,False,True,t1_esi8xqv,/r/eu4/comments/c7s9wr/the_imperial_council_reu4_weekly_general_help/esish6q/,False,,1571219749,2,True,[],False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,0,

Com o ritmo atual de desmonte da estrutura de fiscalização e da legislação ambiental demonstrado durante os seis primeiros meses, a destruição da floresta pode atingir um limite irreversível ""em dois governos Bolsonaro"", prevê o cientista Paulo Artaxo, doutor em física atmosférica pela Universidade de São Paulo (USP) e estudioso da Amazônia desde 1984, quando viajou para lá pela primeira vez como parte de sua pesquisa de doutorado. 

Estimativas mostram que, desmatada uma área de 40% da floresta, o restante não consegue sustentar o funcionamento de um ecossistema de uma floresta tropical chuvosa e, nesse cenário, parte da floresta poderia virar cerrado. A Amazônia já perdeu 20% da cobertura original. 

""É uma questão absolutamente crucial para a estabilidade do clima do planeta - assim como reduzir as emissões de combustíveis fósseis dos países desenvolvidos"", explica Artaxo.

Hoje em dia, ele vai à região pelo menos uma vez por mês para supervisionar o Projeto LBA, a torre de 325 metros que investiga a atmosfera amazônica e que permitiu ao cientista ajudar a desvendar a formação das nuvens de chuva na Amazônia. 

Artaxo é um dos 12 brasileiros que fazem parte da lista dos 4.000 cientistas mais influentes do mundo, feita com base em números de citações em artigos acadêmicos pela [Highly Cited Researchers 2018](https://hcr.clarivate.com/). Também é membro, desde 2003, do Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC). 

O pesquisador conversou com a BBC News Brasil na última quinta-feira (27), quando começou a ser noticiada [a resposta](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-48783709) do presidente Bolsonaro aos comentários feitos pela chanceler alemã Angela Merkel sobre a política ambiental do Brasil - ao chegar ao Japão para a cúpula do G20, o presidente afirmou que a Alemanha tinha muito o que aprender com o país e que não tinha ido ao encontro para ""ser advertido"".

Para Artaxo, é justamente a pressão vinda de outros países o único caminho que pode frear o atual processo desmonte da fiscalização e da legislação ambientais que ele afirma ter se iniciado com o novo governo. Usar temas econômicos como moeda de troca, como foi o caso do acordo entre Mercosul e União Europeia, seria uma estratégia eficiente nesse sentido. 

Enquanto isso, o cenário que era de mudança climática se encaminha cada vez mais para o de ""emergência climática"" global. 

Nas condições atuais, o planeta vai aquecer em média 3,5ºC. No caso do Brasil, ""vamos ver o Nordeste se desertificar totalmente nos próximos 30 anos, vamos ver alterações profundas no bioma amazônico e mudanças climáticas sem precedentes nos últimos 10 milhões de anos"".

""Isto vai ocorrer. O que nós podemos fazer é minimizar esse cenário.""

Leia, a seguir, trechos da entrevista.

   Direito de imagem Paulo Whitaker/Reuters   Image caption  Brasil reduziu o ritmo de desmatamento de 24 mil km² por ano pra 4.000 km² entre 2004 e 2012   **BBC News Brasil - Como o senhor avalia a agenda ambiental nesses seis meses de governo Bolsonaro?**

**Paulo Artaxo - **A mesma coisa que o Trump fez nos EUA. Basicamente desmontar toda a legislação ambiental - que, no Brasil, foi construída a duras penas ao longo dos últimos 30 anos, incluindo Código Florestal e assim por diante -, e desmontar toda a estrutura de fiscalização do Ministério do Meio Ambiente.

Porque este governo tem como uma das principais bandeiras o não cumprimento da lei. Nós temos um governo que a todo momento diz: 'Olha, não vamos cumprir a lei, essa lei não vale, essa lei não é boa'. Seja de cadeirinhas para criança no carro, seja o cadastro ambiental rural na Amazônia (o presidente editou em junho Medida Provisória extinguindo o prazo para os proprietários de terra fazerem o cadastro). 

Então, a lei que eles não gostam não é pra ser cumprida. É a primeira vez no Brasil a gente tem um governo que vai contra sua própria razão de existência, que é dar um ordenamento jurídico para um país como o Brasil. 

**BBC News Brasil - Em termos de medidas concretas, em que consiste esse desmonte ao qual o sr. se refere?**

**Artaxo -** O principal é você estimular ações violentas no campo. O atual governo está fazendo isso, primeiro, por meio da não repressão quando esses atos violentos ocorrem. 

O Brasil hoje é campeão de ações que matam ambientalistas, aqueles que lutam pelo direito da terra, ações contra populações indígenas e assim por diante. O que a gente vê é uma fração muito pequena do que está ocorrendo no campo, que é o que acaba saindo na grande imprensa. 

A segunda questão é a destruição de todo o sistema de fiscalização ambiental no Brasil. O Ibama tinha, por exemplo, um sistema chamado Prevfogo, de prevenção de queimadas, que tinha centenas de funcionários há um ano e hoje está reduzido a algumas dezenas de pessoas para cuidar do combate a queimadas na Amazônia. 

É um sistema que, mesmo que o Brasil no ano que vem retome a necessidade de combater queimadas, basicamente todas as pessoas que estavam lidando com isso foram dispensadas.

**BBC News Brasil - O governo fala, nesses casos, que isso é reflexo da falta de recursos, que acaba afetando todos os ministérios... **

**Artaxo -** O Brasil é a nona economia do planeta e não existe essa questão de falta de recursos. Falta de recursos é uma justificativa para você implementar a sua própria agenda. Por que não faltam recursos para pagar os juros da dívida? Por que não faltam recursos para financiar a produção agropecuária brasileira? Por que não faltam recursos para se dar subsídios às indústrias? 

E faltam recursos para manter um sistema como o Prevfogo, que custa absolutamente nada para o país, mas que foi desmantelado. O discurso de falta de recursos não existe. O problema é onde você aloca os recursos. É a mesma coisa nos EUA. O Trump desmontou toda a estrutura da EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). É falta de dinheiro? Não. É ideologia. 

**BBC News Brasil - O sr. elencou então como segundo ponto esse desmonte da estrutura de fiscalização...**

**Artaxo - **Fiscalização e legislação. Aí entra, por exemplo, o desmonte do Conama (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente, criado em 1981 e do qual o físico faz parte), da estrutura de monitoramento e acompanhamento das mudanças climáticas globais, que antes era dividido entre Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia, Ministério do Meio Ambiente e Itamaraty. 

Se você vai hoje nesses três órgãos e pergunta quem cuida da questão climática no país, você não encontra ninguém. Toda a divisão de clima do MCTI não existe mais. 

É um desmonte que, para se refazer toda essa estrutura num próximo governo, vai demorar de 10 a 20 anos, realisticamente. 

**BBC News Brasil - Do ponto de vista ambiental, que tipo de consequência de médio e longo prazo essa política pode acarretar? Pode haver algum tipo de dano irreversível?**

**Artaxo -** Pode não, já está tendo. O desmatamento na Amazônia já está aumentando, porque todos os mecanismos de combate foram desmantelados. 

Não são problemas futuros - é no presente. A questão de agrotóxicos. Vamos ter algum problema no futuro? Não, estamos tendo no presente. São quase 250 novos agrotóxicos, inclusive que são proibidos em outros países, aprovados nesses seis meses. Não é no futuro, é prejuízo hoje, que já está ocorrendo.

**BBC News Brasil - Existe uma conta de que o ""ponto de não retorno"" para a Amazônia, a partir do qual a floresta entraria em autodestruição, seria um desmatamento de 40% de sua área. O quão distante estamos desse limite?**

**Artaxo -** Ontem (26/6) o INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) soltou um novo número de quanto da floresta original foi desmatada. 

Nós desmatamos 20% - 20% de 5,5 milhões de km² é uma área absurdamente grande. Estimativas de cálculos do Carlos Nobre, do Thomas Lovejoy mostram que, se você desmatar 40% da floresta, basicamente o restante não tem condições de sustentar o funcionamento de um ecossistema de uma floresta tropical chuvosa. 

E aí todo o carbono que está armazenado naquela floresta vai para atmosfera, agravando em muito e acelerando em muito as mudanças climáticas. 

Nós não estamos falando de um aspecto trivial ou de um aspecto que não tenha impacto sério sobre o clima do planeta. É uma questão absolutamente crucial para a estabilidade do clima do planeta - assim como reduzir as emissões de combustíveis fósseis dos países desenvolvidos, em particular dos EUA. 

**BBC News Brasil - Então estamos no meio do caminho?**

**Artaxo -** Isso, estamos no meio do caminho. E o restante do caminho pode acontecer nos próximos oito anos, durante dois mandatos de governo Bolsonaro. 

**BBC News Brasil - No ritmo atual, essa é uma possibilidade real?**

**Artaxo -** Não há menor dúvida. A única coisa que pode impedir isso é pressão internacional. É o que a Merkel está fazendo essa semana (a chanceler alemã declarou, em sessão do Parlamento, estar ""muito preocupada"" com a atuação do presidente brasileiro na área ambiental, disse considerar a situação ""dramática"" e afirmou que conversaria sobre o tema com Bolsonaro durante a cúpula do G20).

Plastic bags?  Let retailers and customers do what's best for themselves.  I actually like the European model, bags are available for the customer to purchase, and many customers choose to bring their own bags.  I reuse plastic bags to line trash cans, for scooped cat litter, for policing dog poop, and other things, so I like to get them, although I usually bring my own bags when shopping at the store that sells bags instead of giving them away with purchase.  

Your retailers compete in the marketplace.  If consumers such as yourself start asking them to do something to encourage their customers to bring their own, reusable bags, great.  If enough people ask retailers to either stop using plastic bags, or reduce their use via charging for them, you can probably effect the change you want without involving government to do the heavy handed work for you.

Don't waste your student loan on liberal arts or whatever. If you love writing but you can't make money from it, THEN DON'T FUCKING WRITE! Sorry for coming off harsh but when you choose a career, profit is the first thing you should look for. If that thing also combines your passion, even better. If you like writing, then maybe you should invest your time into learning the copywriting skill. You could write ads for people. It's like a salesperson but in print. This is a high income skill.

The issue, however, isn't with the *length* of the Mediterranean Sea vs. the Atlantic Ocean (as one can see, a nonstop trip across the Mediterranean would have been analogous to an early modern voyage across the Atlantic.) It's that a nonstop trip across the Mediterranean would have been ... daft.

In the ancient world, and frankly even to today, the Mediterranean would have had a *lot* of different ports of call. A merchant vessel would therefore *not* be sailing directly between Alexandria and the Pillars of Hercules (as the Strait of Gibraltar was known then), but rather would be sailing, say, from Alexandria to southern Greece, from there to Syracuse (in Sicily, on to some port in North Africa, and from there on to the Pillars, dropping off and picking up goods and supplies at every waypoint. So, instead of sailing 3000 miles in one fell swoop, it would have been several journeys of 400-500ish miles each. Sailing directly from Alexandria to Lisbon made no financial sense whatsoever.

As a consequence, our Roman mariner would have had no concept of the deep sea crossing from the Azores (which, to be fair, is about halfway across the Atlantic) to the North American mainland, and such a journey would have required a vessel with about double the storage space for crew supplies (and hence either a bigger vessel or a vessel with less space in the hold for salable materials) than what would have been common in the Mediterranean. European discovery and colonization of the Azores [only dates to the fifteenth century,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores#European_discovery) anyhow.

Now, to be fair, there was a *significant* [Roman trade with India,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDTaOOVbxLs) following the monsoon routes, and the Arabian Sea crossing is actually analogous with the deepwater crossing of the Atlantic from the Azores to the North American mainland -- about a thousand miles.

However, there was a good reason to be undertaking such risky voyages, and there would have developed separate seafaring cultures within the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean basins; there was little in the way of a good reason to challenge the River Ocean on his deep when markets further west remained unknown.

Finally, galley ships, like triremes, were primarily warships. It makes some sense for them to be mercantile when plying coastal routes, because there were ports-of-call roughly a day's journey away from each other, or when one was trading at the fringes of the known world (such as down the African coast), where more bodies = more defense, but the typical merchant ship sailing in the comparatively safe waters of the Mediterranean would have looked more [like this.](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/39/2c/ea/392cea67e8c1815ef10b886ebeefe79a.jpg)

However, I'm not a huge fan of purchasing $1,200 items from Europe due to potential difficulties in returning the item if there are issues. So I decided to buy the rim from Amazon, and I'm glad I did. 

As soon as I got the wheel out of the box the button frame around neutral popped off as you can see in the picture (top left). You can see (maybe) around the switch in the top left that the tube they use to shine light through the wheel is rough cut compared to the on on the right. Moreover, two directions of the 7 way hat switch didn't work or weren't working correctly. The neutral button felt kind of loose as I wiggled it around a bit. Finally, the stickers that were applied were already lifting. 

The carbon had a bit of flex. More than my Simulaje F1s which Barry mentioned flexed a bit. I don't think this is an issue in a normal driving scenario. 

If any one of these things were an issue, other than the broken hat switch, I would probably let it slide with how much I like the shifters. However, all of these issues on a $1,200 rim feels wrong and it will be going back tomorrow. 

What I can say is that grips felt nice. The shifters were great and the CNC machining all around was excellent. I really liked the rotary encoders as well. 

I wish Cube Controls had better quality control, but I won't be buying from them again. 

I'll upload pics and a video so people can see in better detail the issues. 

Images: https://imgur.com/gallery/A7JzZAF

The first image is the missing button guard, then rough cut on the light tubing, then peeling stickers.

Edit: I figured out the issue with the hat switch/7 function switch. And it isn't as bad as I originally thought. 

The button top is 3d printed (I assume based on the layer lines under the switch) and doesn't fit the switch quite like it should. It is allowed to sit a bit too low against the button frame impeding it's movement. When I tried engaging the right and down directions a few more times the switch engaged which surprised me as I thought it was broken, but then when I turned the switch it didn't engage the rotary encoder which was working prior. 

Pulling the top off the switch you could see that it is glued on (I assume that the glue gave way when I got the hat switch to engage. The other option is that the switch top was designed for the hat switch and the plastic gave way, but I don't think that is the case as it looked like it was glued on) and doesn't have a grub screw the hat switch/7 function switch is designed for. A little glue is all you need to fix it. 

I do like how they finished the switch top and I wouldn't have known that it was 3d printed unless I pulled it apart as the bottom didn't have the same finish.

Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug.[10] It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein.[9] Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation.[9] Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils.[9] High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature.[11] Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.[9] Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.[12]

Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain.[10] After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur.[10] Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death.[10][13] Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity.[14] Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.[10]

Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.[10] This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain.[10] It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier.[15][16] Cocaine is a naturally occurring substance found in the coca plant which is mostly grown in South America.[9] In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally.[17] It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to US$500 billion each year.[10] With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.[10]

Cocaine is the second most frequently used illegal drug globally, after cannabis.[18] Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year.[10] Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America.[10] Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life.[10] In 2013, cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990.[19] The leaves of the coca plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times.[14] Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860.[10] Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.[20]

Space Megaforce, known in Japan as Super Aleste (スーパーアレスタ), is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed by Compile. It was published by Toho in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as part of the Aleste series. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a spaceship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from American and European ones. However, Super Aleste also offers a ""Short Game"", where only a set of small levels are played, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.

There are two very important things you have to do with normies.

 A) figure out where they need to be redpilled first: women, media, demographics, black crime, iq, religion, Jews.  Everyone needs a different starting point. Take days, weeks or even months, studying your target and seeing where they are the softest.  I started with gender, then demographics, then race, jq last.  If someone had tried to start me on race or jq I'd probably still be a democrat right now. 

B) The most effective redpilling is the balance of exclusion and inclusion in addition to subtle shifts in language.  Jews do this artfully and we could learn a lot from them. With exclusion you simply don't tolerate people in your closer social circles who are verbally anti white.  This is HUGE and it's how people broke through my liberal bubble. There's a deep visceral reaction people have when they feel they've transgressed the group consensus or might be excluded entirely (especially in women). I was hanging out with some conservative boomer Canadians (and I like Canadians) and they straight up shamed me for saying I don't care about white population decline.  This deep down got to me because they made me look a bit stupid in the social setting I was in at the time and that created a seed of cog dissonance inside of me that as a logical critical thinking person I just couldn't shake off.  For weeks is just sat in my subconscious festering. It was a sweater string just dangling. Then I went down the path.  Inclusion is another approach.  If you have a younger friend, brother, sister, girlfriends, wives, charges that look up to you they will go with whatever you tell them if you say it with conviction and you do it in a slow way.  You have to condition people.  This is also how cultural Marxists slow boiled the frog and how sexual predators operate but it's a powerful force that can be used for good as well.  Condition people *slowly*.  Marinate them first in anti leftism/degeneracy (which comes natural to almost everyone), then anti Marxism, then European pride, then white nationalist ideas.  Especially if they are people forced to be around you.  Family members and best friends can't easily push you out of their life.  Never try to redpill someone fast who is someone you can't afford to lose/alienate in your life.  It's also a good rule of thumb to not even try with people over 40.  Unless they show hints of interest when you drop clues.

Virgin Queen might be a little more accessible than HIS but basically you have the equivalent of 3 or 4 war games going on all at the same time.

You have the Vatican vs Protestants in their own thing across Europe, you have Suliman invading from the Ottoman empire, you have England just trying to produce a male heir, you have the Holy Roman Empire trying to hold Europe together &amp; exploit the New World, you have France trying to snipe at the HRE. Historically each of the factions have an ""ally"" (France &amp; Ottomans oddly enough, England and the Protestants, HRE &amp; the Vatican) although all the goals are kind of muddied. 

It's a card driven wargame, similar to Twilight Strugle where decks get added to the main deck as time goes on. Leaders age and die, and you just have to deal with their historical replacements for better or worse. There's a \*lot\* of negotiation, in fact the first round I believe starts with the Field of Cloth of Gold where England decides if it's going to side (temporarily) with France or Spain. Meanwhile Martin Luther is kicking up trouble and sets off debates and purges and reformations across Europe that basically just make everyone's lives miserable. 

It's a trip of a game. It's kind of a grail game since it's so heavy &amp; involved. Check out some of the play by forum or session reports over on the geek. It's a trip.

 No dia 18 de junho, membros do Ministério Público Federal de todo o país fizeram uma votação interna e [escolheram três nomes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/procurador-experiente-na-area-criminal-encabeca-lista-triplice-para-pgr-veja-nomes.shtml) para compor uma lista tríplice que será entregue ao presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 Embora não haja previsão legal nem constitucional, todos os presidentes da República, desde 2003, têm indicado alguém da lista para a PGR.

 “No meu sentimento, o presidente tem direito de escolha constitucional e o Senado aprova ou não aprova, após uma sabatina, o respectivo nome”, respondeu Toffoli ao ser questionado se, ao indicar alguém da lista tríplice, o presidente poderia fazer um aceno positivo ao MPF.

 “Do ponto de vista do Supremo, o que eu teria a dizer? Seria importante que fosse um subprocurador-geral, ou seja, que fosse alguém da última classe da carreira. A própria lei orgânica do Ministério Público estabelece que, para atuar nos tribunais superiores, tem que ser do último degrau da carreira”, afirmou.

 Estão na lista tríplice, nesta ordem, dois subprocuradores-gerais, Mario Bonsaglia e Luiza Frischeisen, e um procurador regional, Blal Dalloul —nível intermediário na carreira. 

 Questionado em seguida sobre uma eventual recondução da atual procuradora-geral, [Raquel Dodge,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/raquel-dodge/) o presidente do Supremo respondeu que ela tem feito um excelente trabalho.

 “A doutora Raquel Dodge tem desempenhado um excelente trabalho. No âmbito do CNJ [Conselho Nacional de Justiça] junto com o CNMP [Conselho Nacional do Ministério Público] temos várias atividades em conjunto”, disse.

 Dodge não se inscreveu para disputar a eleição interna. Em 2017, ela chegou à PGR, indicada [por Michel Temer (MDB),](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/michel-temer/) após participar da disputa e ficar em segundo lugar na lista tríplice.

Britain doesnt give 2 shits about HK. 

From HKU press, ""[Concise History of Hong Kong](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/con/5.pdf)"":

&gt;During the countdown to 1997, the Western media depicted Hong Kong as a bastion of democracy, free expression, and prosperity, often ignoring how for so long Hong Kong had been a **colony with little democracy or freedom of expression**. But any assessment of the British colonial legacy must consider the entire colonial period rather than only the last decade or so of British rule, when the British introduced last-minute political reforms. 

&gt;Although colonial Hong Kong was theoretically based on the rule of law, some jurists and legal scholars argue that common law has never taken root in Hong Kong, mainly because it is so different from the traditional Chinese legal system, while others suggest that most people in colonial Hong Kong had only a superficial knowledge of common law because the language of the law was English (trials are often still held in English, as many judges are expatriates and most counsels received their legal training in English). 

&gt;Furthermore, the government  enacted a wave of anti-Chinese legislation from the earliest years, passed various emergency and discriminatory ordinances, and often censored the Chinese press. The 1951 Control of Publications Ordinance, which made it an offense to publish anything that might incite people to commit sedition or treason, was not repealed until 1987. As journalist C. K. Lau argues, Hong Kong’s “supposedly high degree of press freedom” should be “better understood as **allowing the press great latitude to comment on Chinese politics, but not on the legitimacy of British rule**.” 

&gt;Hong Kong’s colonial civil service was generally efficient and politically neutral, but until the last years **Europeans dominated senior positions on the grounds that Chinese were not qualified or trustworthy enough**. Political power, writes Leo Goodstadt, “was controlled by colonial officials, alien in both language and culture who, with the other members of this European minority, enjoyed superior status and influence solely on account of their race.” Because they were so isolated from the Chinese community, “expatriates were in no position to identify the frustrations and the aspirations of their constituents, their fears as well as their hopes.” Because these expatriates had little knowledge of life in public housing estates, for example, **standards of housing and social services “fell well below what Hong Kong could afford** even after its prosperity was assured by its export triumphs.”

&gt;Similarly, James Hsiung argues that because they were not problems facing expatriates, the colonial government had little concern about Hong Kong’s inordinate **income-distribution inequities, “the very problem of abject poverty amidst affluence”; the “scandalous” condition of the elderly living in poverty; and the lack of unemployment insurance, which the government believed would only encourage laziness**. “The sad thing,” laments Hsiung, “is that this lack of compassion perpetuated by colonial policy as such has rubbed off on the British-educated local elite even into the postcolonial era.”

&gt;Hong Kong has often been described as a capitalist’s paradise and as one of the world’s freest and most competitive economies. But this economy historically depended on political patronage and **discriminatory monopolies that favored large British firms**. Directors of large British firms such as Jardine and Matheson, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and the Swire Group regularly held seats on the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. Cable and Wireless, a British corporation, had the telephone monopoly until very recently. 

&gt;Well after World War II, the colonial government refrained from encouraging industrialization because it violated official colonial policy of stressing trade and commerce. The overrepresentation of business and professional classes in the colonial power structure also restricted competition in the property market. As historian Ming Chan puts it, free trade and free enterprise “did not always  mean fair trade and equal opportunity.”

&amp;#x200B;

Mas vamos pro seu segundo pseudo argumento.  


Você disse:  (Eu falei ""Se você esta tentando impedir pessoas de usar o SUS... você não tem direito de usar."" )  


Continuo discordando... Primeiro que, se pessoa X defende o Livre Mercado, e fala à favor do mesmo, não significa que essa pessoa X esteja querendo IMPEDIR alguém de fazer qualquer coisa que seja. Ela apenas está transmitindo seus anseios aos demais, votando em quem pensa igual, falando sobre o assunto, divulgando as ideias, etc, para que ela(PESSOA X), possa viver em um ambiente que considera mais favorável a todos. Está, portanto, lutando pelos seus ideais.

Se eu quero uma casa específica W, na esquina Y do bairro Z, não significa que eu estou tentando IMPEDIR que outras pessoas morem nessa casa, apenas significa que eu QUERO/DESEJO morar naquela casa específica W.  


Um outro exemplo melhor: Eu gostaria que o governo privatizasse as universidades federais, mas enquanto isso não ocorrer, vou usufruir(e tenho direito) dessas universidades se eu precisar. Depois que privatizar, usufruo se quiser e se puder($). De acordo com você, por pensar assim eu estou tentando IMPEDIR que pessoas estudem em universidades federais ""de graça"", logo, eu não deveria JÁ HOJE ter o direito de estudar em uma federal. Quando na verdade eu apenas gostaria que o dinheiro fosse realocado pro SUS(que atende mais pobres que ricos) ao invés de ficar nas universidades federais(que atendem mais ricos que pobres). Ou, caso o dinheiro não fosse realocado, poderíamos diminuir os impostos, aumentando a qualidade de vida da esmagadora maioria da população. Com menos impostos, as pessoas conseguiriam enriquecer com mais facilidade, e poderiam pagar suas faculdades ou de seus filhos, de repente nem precisariam pensar em faculdade pois teriam mais oportunidades. Dei o exemplo de realocar pro SUS mas por mim o SUS também não existiria, mas vejo como retorno muito mais útil de impostos do que universidades federais, por isso o exemplo. Sem o SUS, teríamos que pagar ainda menos impostos, e seria mais fácil pagar planos de saúde com esse dinheiro extra que o Estado roubaria a menos do nosso bolso.

The IQ scale was then made to prove white Europeans’ intelligence, but this one is very biased. Since African people didn’t learn the same stuff as Europeans, they had lower scores on such tests. That doesn’t mean they are dumber at all; it just meant they weren’t taught the same things! 

Europeans also made up the existence of a pure Aryan race to oppress those who weren’t “pure”. Of course, white Europeans were the purest of them all and they were obsessed with keeping it that way. This was especially a big thing in America, where it was completely unheard of and illegal to be in a relationship with someone from another “race”. 

Back to the concept of an “aryan race”. This idea was spread throughout the entire world. Europeans used it to create an “us vs them” feeling within other cultures. 

There were “aryan people” within African, Asian, ... cultures who were treated better and were privileged . The Europeans used them to keep the other cultures in check.

Or anyone who is concerned about managing the flow of oil and stability of the region. Which sometimes has knock-on effects.

Take Syria: theoretically it wasn't in the interests of anyone but warmongering US policy makers, as some would see it. Then a million people ran into Europe and the entire EU political landscape shifted. 

&gt; This same line of reasoning could be applied to Israel's nuclear program 

And the US bribes Egypt to keep the peace with Israel, provides a security guarantee for KSA (and other Asian nations like Japan and such) which discourages them from looking for their own nuclear deterrent. 

In the event that the US pulls out or is perceived to be unreliable or a close rival gets nukes, all those nations under said umbrella  have their incentives changed. I believe the Saudis have explicitly warned about this. 

&gt;Given the US's history of aggression I'd say it is absolutely fine with ""boiling over"", 

US history does give reason for cynicism but I think this is going too far.

You'd have to explain why, under this theory, Obama negotiated the deal at all or the reaction to intervention during his term.

&gt; I would almost say it's irrational for the iranian government to not pursue nuclear weapons

Sure. And the US perceives that it is in its interests to deny it to them. That's what the topic is about: the US effort.

&gt;Why?

It's curious that you want me to explain. I know you know why. 

Nations, especially nations that are hostile to the US don't want to give it things for free. There has to be some concern over the consequences of not making a deal that will justify them folding, especially on matters of utmost importance like this.

Look at Assad: Let's say Assad wants to gas his people to win the war. If there was no credible fear of US military response, why should he  back down when Obama warns him against doing so? It's a matter of survival and victory, if costs are not imposed upon him, why should he risk losing? And look, once he felt that it was unlikely for violence to happen to him for it, there was news of gassing again in Syria.

The US is currently in a space where people are deathly afraid of intervention and doing ""the wrong thing"". So the solution seems to be locking down any action because it's assumed to be the ""wrong thing"" prima facie. But there will be times when you simply run into intransigence and imminent problems where you do have to flex your muscles. 

The entire point of having the most powerful military force in history and all that diplomatic and economic cachet is to be able to use it to get nations to move your way.

Pakeha (European New Zealanders) were culturally very close to European Australians and British people and identified strongly with them. Even had the Maori been angry enough at the waste of life in WW2 to rebel (which didn't happen), Pakeha would likely have still seen the losses during the war as a noble sacrifice to help their European brethren. It's unlikely that the Maori would have been able to convince the Pakeha majority to submit to non-European rule and become a minority in a Polynesian country.

At the time, there were also attempts by the New Zealand government to dilute Maori culture and society, which argues against them allowing any serious cultural influence from the rest of Polynesia. Most non-Maori Polynesian influence here is limited to Auckland and was brought by immigrants, who would presumably have moved to Hawaii in this timeline instead. The Maori King movement is important to our history, but never had all that much of a political impact.

My feeling is that modern-day Kiwis would be much more likely to join such a confederation than at that time, as the culture has become much more syncretic and outward looking. Also, it feels like a Maori cultural and linguistic resurgence is happening now, with the support of broader society, and a large part of Auckland's population today is Polynesian, to the point where it is sometimes referred to as the cultural capital of Polynesia. But I suspect people would still expect New Zealand to be at the heart of the union or an equal member in an EU-style federation, and people may not be too pleased with another monarch in an age where many are questioning whether we need our current one. Also, the South Island is far more Pakeha-dominated than even the North Island, and I can't see the people there being too pleased with this arrangement.

EDIT: It might actually be more likely that non-Polynesian Pacific countries like Kiribati and Fiji would want to join. And New Zealand territories or states in Free Association like the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau would have a reason to leave NZ and join this federation.

Most western fantasy is based off of Europe not in the 21st century but medieval Europe of the 11th 14th centuries or about 1000 years after the Roman Empire. It also is using a lot of tropes that originally came about during the Renaissance (rebirth and also rediscovery of the ancients) of the 14th-17th Centuries.

Only towards the end of these time periods did Europe really surpass the Romans all out. Both in technology and in size of empires.

Further, most major religions are based on texts that are around 2000 years old, and that one of the tropes of modern philosophy, only somewhat in jest, is that it is all a footnote to Plato. Even today we are often not that different. However much I might wish we were.

The classic Fantasy tropes are based on very real human creations.

I personally get more out of the genre knowing that interplay, and many writers intentionally use it hoping that people get something of it.

That is a letter written by Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania to the Financial Times about the marijuana crisis of Albania in 2017. I would like to hear your thoughts on it.

I think that trying to focus on the elimination of the underground drug industry sounds like good publicity and that is probably what the EU members want to hear. Although, that means getting rid of a profitable industry that supports many of its people and the economy. So, why not legalize it and profit from it safely? Probably because that is not in the interest of the Mafia that controls it and which likely controls the elected government officials.

So getting rid of a significant amount of judges - even if they are believe to be corrupt - does not immediately improve the judicial process but rather slows it down dramatically. The two changes that will significantly target corruption with the Mafia and politicians is by putting in place the right checks and balances as well as ways to reinforce those rules. 

Lastly, coming from a business standpoint, the country wants better quality of life then it will need to focus on promoting foreign investment. Although, no investor would want to commit capital to a country that lacks regulatory structure, a robust financial services industry, educated workforce, and safe communities, and the list can go on. So, the first step to making this all possible is by proving to the world that Albania is ready to undergo radical change for the betterment of the people.

Also, it might be hard to explain if you don’t have a basic understanding of how some genes are more resistant/prone to being diluted out than others - which explains why someone can exhibit both clearly sub-Saharan African features AND a beard (or green eyes, Roman nose, etc.) It should not be surprising that this pops up more in America.

“Darker” genes, like having more melanin in the hair, skin, and eyes, are composed of a set of genes (not just one for skin or one for eyes), and these genes are typically dominant. To simplify, a homozygous dominant gene is highly likely to manifest in an offspring, even if the other parent is homozygous recessive. The result is a heterozygous gene that exhibits only the dominant gene.
As for the set of genes that make up propensity for a thicker beard, well they can probably make their way into a gene pool through a few generations while other genes that we know are dominant still stick around. Does that address your point about their beards being thick and dark while they’re also black?

Also worth noting that sub-Saharan Africans can grow a beard pattern, but they do not exhibit the full pattern (or even body hair patterns) of a lot of Europeans (which itself can be diverse or dependent on ethnicity). African Americans will often exhibit this though. For instance, MC Ride from Death Grips looks fully African, but exhibits body hair not typically seen in Africa, except for when he shaves it.

The transit back in Gothenburg is not that cheap, especially considering the significantly lower salaries, but it is the convenience that people are paying for. Also, it frees you up from looking for a parking spot for 10-15 minutes.

[],,xboxg4mer,1403960972.0,,,[],,We're fucked!,dark,text,t2_h66ac,False,[],"When Scotland voted, the union much like a chair had four legs of its campaign:

1). Remaining in the EU

2). Remaining in a stable economy

3). Being given additional powers within the UK to further advance devolution

4). Guaranteeing stability over a leap in the dark. 

My friend, each of those legs has not only broken, but has been sawed swiftly in half by the people who first glued them together. 

Let's go through them in order. 

1) remaining in the EU. 

It's no surprise that Scotland - the only country in the UK in which every constituency, in which 62% (a vast majority) voted to remain in the EU actually wanted to remain in the EU. The benefits that come with it are enumerable and Scottish people have the strongest sense of European identity out of any UK nation. To take us out of the EU, especially when we voted to remain is simply undemocratic. This is also reflective of the fact that the UK is overall undemocratic. Yes we have a vote, but in the past 70 or so years, it has only changed the outcome of two elections. Please let that sink in. Two. This is reflected by the fact that Scotland has not voted in a Tory government since the early 1950s yet we have had a Tory government for more than half of that. In which way is that democratic? It's ok to say you have a voice, but what good is it if it's so quiet that no one listens? 

2) remaining in a stable economy. 

At the time, taking the leap towards independence was portrayed by unionists as being an economic suicide. ""You can't use the pound"" they said. A lie. ""Your oil and gas will run out within a decade"". Another lie. ""You're too small to be independent"". My friend, this is yet another lie. Scotland could use the pound after independence (not that we would want to for very long), our oil reserves have been shown that they will last at least fifty more years and even if they don't Scotland is very nearly at a stage of being fully powered by green energy. And finally the ""You're too small"". Many of the world's richest economy's are close to that of Scotland, some have even less wealth than us and having a small population is an immense benefit as it is cheaper to pay for social programmes such as healthcare and education for 5.5 million that 60 million. Scotland may only have around 8% of the UK population but we do have:

90% of all fresh water in the UK 

61% of total sea area

65% of UK natural gas reserves

96.5% of all crude oil in the UK

62% of UK forest areas

46% of UK timber production 

92% of all hydeo-elextric power

40% of all wind, wave and solar energy production 

60% of all fish landed 

30% of the total beef here

100% of a billion pound Scottish whisky industry

£10 billion business services industry 

£13 billion food and drink services

£17 billion construction industry 

£9.3 billion tourist industry

£9.3 billion chemical service industry 

£7 billion financial services industry 

£5 billion aero-service industry

£4.5 billion in whisky exports

£3.1 billion life science industry 

£350 million textile exports

And 

Over 25% of all wind wave and energy potential in Europe. My friend, we earn all of this and more, annually! Scotland not only has the means to be independent but the means to be so and thrive as one of the world's most successful nations. 

Why on earth would you want to deny yourself the right to actually govern your own country, especially seeing as no country who has ever left Britain's rule has asked to return? Why would you want your wealth and democratic rights stolen by southern politicians in a southern parliament making policies that negatively impact people here who did not vote for them?

3) Being given additional powers 

Immediately after brexit the UK took powers from Scotland in a power grab. They plan to take even more and the additional powers gag was just that; a ploy to get voters on side to keep them subservient to westminister. So not only did they not gove us additional power, they took power away from us.

4). Guaranteeing stability over a leap in the dark

Hahahahaha stability is teresa Mays favourite word yet she has never ran a stable government in her very short tenure. The UK is anything but stable as shown in the past five years. At every turn westminister makes the wrong decision and harms the people of the UK and further destroys their so called precious union, which by the way is not so precious after all seeing as over 60% of Tories would rather have brexit than keep Scotland in the UK. 

You call the snp fascist, my friend, fascism is described as 

&gt; Fascism is a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy 

The snp are left wing, not right, they are fighting for our democratic rights to be protected (especially since the UK after brexit seems intent on suppressing them), remember how I told you that our vote has only counted twice in over 70 years? That's because they don't respect the democratic voice of Scotland. Forcible suppression of the opposition. In this scenario the snp are opposing the establishment of westminister and are indeed being suppressed. Tory owned media has largely ignored positive cases for Indy while bashing the snp at every turnndespite solid and grounded evidence that the UK is fundamentally flawed and that Scotland did not vote for much if what they do. The UK is not fascist by any means and throwing that term around is not wise, speaking as a student of history, in doing so you simply lessen the actual fact that fascist do exist in the UK and that they are indeed invading the UK political scene under the guise of brexiteers. Fascism is no joke my friend and using it loosely seems to make the suffering of those who actually had to suffer through fascist regimes less so please think before you throw it around. Independence would not mean we would get rid of the queen, by all means she will still be our head of state much like Canada and other common wealth countries unless we vote to get rid of her. Indy has nothing to do with the ira and nothing tondo with protestants or any religion. It's a political point not a religious. I know many Catholics who will vote yes and an equal number of protestants who will do so.

No, of course that's entirely up to them. I mean, pressed for a settlement that prolongs the uncertainty in the UK while settling the concerns of the EU.

&gt;What sequencing? You've lost me on that point... 

You know, the ""we'll settle the EU's demands first, and then we'll start to discuss what the future looks like"" - a format designed to maximise the uncertainty for the UK.

&gt;The breaks in the process are attributable to us. If May didn't have a red line on freedom of movement, eg, it would have been a lot easier.

Both sides have red lines. The trick is to be open to innovative solutions - if you're negotiating in good faith.

Did that already. Guy ran away with one of our plane. 

&gt;Hand over PSM to a Japanese Steel company.

PSM just needs to be depoliticized. Once that is done, it will be profitable. I think in early 20s that was a huge demand for Pak steel in central Asia.

&gt;.Or S. Korean if they build a Shipyard.​ (Enticement)

Already been plans in of building one. Can't remember if it was China or some other nation that offered to do this. 

&gt;Hand over Railways to a European/ Japanese/ Chinese head.

We have talented people here, don't need to hand everything over

&gt;Revitalize Railways factory, joint partnership for new locomotives.

Yeah, we need to bring this. But right now, Pak rail is recovering from years off Loss. Once its starts becoming profitable, maybe then.

&gt;Any strikes by doctors or government employees, that hamper their duties or the safety/health of the public will see them fired and on a blacklist. With removal of any special licenses they held.

Doctors in Pakistan have a god like complex. They operate without any fear. Punishing them for protesting, not good approach. Punishing them for their mistakes, I am fully on board. For doctors in Pakistan, I will vote for collective punishment against their whole family. 

&gt;Hire a Chinese/ S. Korean/ Japanese official, with Special Economic Zones specialty, to run and organize Gwadar.

What?

&gt;Joint venture with foreign automotive company .

Already happening. Some came, some didn't. Some canceled as well.

&gt;Construction of small/ medium dams.

Already been done

&gt;Construction of small/ medium reservoirs.

Already been done or being planned

&gt;Reimbursements of circular debts.

Other steps are being taken to tackle circular debt

&gt;Complete disconnection of public utilities for areas with high levels of non-payments. Those caught stealing utilities will be forced to pay debts of the area.

Already been done. But instead of areas, they are doing it to individuals. Many have been arrested. 


&gt;Freeze all land sales to establish who has ownership of said land.

This is a 70+ year old problem that can't resolved by simply freezing. The approach this government is doing is better. First get rid of the corrupt people, then get land reforms in place. Cause if you still have the corrupt sitting, no matter what land reforms you bring, the problem will still be there.

&gt;Taxation on land of more than 130+ acres of land.

&gt;Taxation of more than 125+ acres of arable land.​

&gt;Agriculture tax.

&gt;On crop yields on 30+ acres.​

&gt;Land Distribution.

&gt;Distribution of arable land above 135 acres held by 1 family.

&gt;Preferably to someone who had been tilting it for past years.​

Previous point

&gt;Exotic Animal Tax.

This is good.

&gt;Taxation ID correlated to CNIC ID number.

I am guessing you didn't file your taxes, cause that is what used for your Tax ID. In fact, from Aug onwards, every CNIC number will be converted into tax ID.

&gt;Tax Credits for Social progress

&gt;For children based on years of schooling.

&gt;For women based on employment.

Not that good right now. Maybe once we have a bigger taxpayer bases

&gt;Empowerment of FBR.

&gt;Enforced cooperation of banking industry with FBR.

&gt;Mandatory reporting by banking industry of 'suspicious' accounts &amp; actions.

&gt;Transfer of money requires biometrics of account holder.

Already done. Grab your popcorn, cause from this month onwards, there will be many people being fined or jailed.  

&gt;Empowerment of SEC.

&gt;Increased transparency of holding &amp; investment companies.

&gt;Funding has to be stated.

&gt;Implementation of global rules &amp; regulations of the industry.

This has been going on for a while. Public listed companies are required  to do that. 

&gt;Liaisons of government banking/finance/taxation industries.

&gt;Increased cooperation between SBP, FBR, SEC, FIA/IB.

This is happening. They all agreed to enhance the insurance industry with it 


&gt;Travel with cash.

&gt;Carried cash limited to $5,000.

Already happening. New limit is now $3,000

&gt;All baggage with traveler, regardless of ticket (public/private/chartered plane searched).

Ummm. This already happens. If not, i don't think we would be credited by international aviation authorities. Without the accreditation, no international flight can land in our airport. 


&gt;Empowerment of NAB.

Already in play

&gt;Corrupt Government Official is removed from office.

Can only be done, once law is amended. That can't happen right now, since no majority in senate.

&gt;Land and property is seized from him/her, spouse, sons and daughters (their in-laws if married).

&gt;No pension(s).

Would love to see this happen.

&gt;Blacklisted and Exit-Control list.​

ECL already happens.

&gt;Elected Officials.

What?

&gt;If Election Board documents found to be incorrect:

&gt;Removal from Office.

Already happens. That is why we have smaller elections going on.


&gt;Separate Courts for corruption trials.​

&gt;Local Governments empowered.

Its never about the law. The issues in Pakistan is about enforcing the law. Fix that, and you will solve huge chunk of the problems 

&gt;Removal of ""development funds"" to MNAs.

The only people who can do that are the MNAs,....very unlikely that will ever happen. 

&gt;Direct elections.​

What?

&gt;Removal of either Chief Minister or Governor for provinces.

Provinces still need a leadership to look up to, instead of PM only. Plus, without them, you would be giving too much power to PM.

&gt;Removal of President of Pakistan.​

He/she doesn't have any power right now, except to tell the parliament which direction they should head. 

&gt;S. Punjab &amp; N. Sindh combined into new province with portion of Northern Balochistan &amp; S. KPK.

Already being planned/done

&gt;Gilgit-Baltistan a separate province integrated.

Despite it being a peaceful area right now, there is still too much geopolitics in play here. 

&gt;Balochistan divided into 3 provinces; Mekhran being 1.

Good idea

&gt;Karachi, Lahore, &amp; Gwadar special territories that are provided funds based on population from province &amp; federal.

Already happens. Its just that because of corruption, the fund never see the light of day. 

&gt;Children must attend public schools.

&gt;Can not receive healthcare overseas if offered in Pakistan.

Good idea. For school, if they choose to send to private school, then they shouldn't be given school allowance. 

&gt;No more 'Gifts', property and property in use is taxed.​

What?

&gt;Dissolution of monthly allowances.

MNAs in charge will never let that happen. 

&gt;Elimination of housing allowances transportation to government employees making more than 45,000 rupees.

Not a good idea. Public transportation is crappy as it is. Once that improves, maybe then. As for housing, Try renting a house, and paying bills while making less then 45K. Very difficult. Maybe government can offer housing units to it employee while they are employed. 

&gt;Increase of salaries of low grade officials.

Already happened. 15% for low grade, and 5% for high grade.

&gt;Elimination of 'batmen', 'chai walas', drivers, servants.

That will increase unemployment. 

&gt;Ministers based on education &amp; relevance to ministry. Technocrats or MPA based on experience.

Good idea based on education. But keep in mind, books can only get you so far.

&gt;Removal of

&gt;Government Land.

What?

&gt;Public Auction of government land.

Already used to happen. If i remember it was thing back in late 90s. After that, corruption showed it ugly face. Auctions were held in back street.

&gt;Buyer must show source of funds.​

They have to do it now.

&gt;Land that is environmentally endangered is preserved into a National Parks Department.

Good idea

&gt;Land used for grazing of animals is 'rented' to shepherds. 

Don't know who that will help anyone.

&gt;Economic analyst of potential for a new'Planned City' potential.

We broke to fix current cities

&gt;No more retirement land handout to military or government officials.

&gt;Government land cannot be bought or traded for private schemes. ​

Previous Land reforms point

&gt;Voters must:

&gt;Be able to read &amp; write.

Sounds good on paper, but hard to implement. Also would be against the constitution 

&gt;Have CNIC.

Already happens

&gt;Filed taxes since last election.

Not right now, maybe later when our taxpayers bases is higher

&gt;No dual citizenship.

Agree with that. Or better, to vote, they must have lived in Pakistan in the last 5 years continuously before voting. 


&gt;Ballot boxes guarded by ECP &amp; Police.

Already Happens. But since police is heavily politicized, rangers/army is used.

&gt;Any ballot stuffing is automatic execution of:

&gt;Ballot stuffers.

&gt;Polling station chief and deputy chief.​

Yes turn to the dark side. Let the hatred flow through you. Strike with your angry. Use the force Vadar.

&gt;Career diplomats.

&gt;Merit based.​

corruption, but maybe soon this will be the case

&gt;Removal of 'foreign living allowances'.

Not every country is a cheap place to live. Although government can provide housing unit for the employee to live in. 

&gt;Show improvements in Pakistan relations .

&gt;Show improvements in Pakistan foreign trade.

That will be difficult to measure. Normally that is done by the foreign minster. Ambassador job is not that.

The natures of the wars fought and the emphasis placed on a Chivalry and prestige are self-evidently different. 

I deny it.  Or rather, I deny that you've given us any reason to believe there was this shift.  Ancient armies mostly didn't do anything much worse to the losing state than medieval ones would have.  They ran off their enemies' herds, pillaged their lands, held people for ransom, and established fortresses to lay claim to their territory.  Medieval warlords laid waste to wide swathes of land, slaughtered cities and towns, and forced their defeated opponents to accept their suzerainty.  A grandee leading a host into an enemy lord's lands and burning his crops until he abandons his former master and acknowledges you as overlord is really not that different than an ancient city forcing another to have the same friends and enemies. 
 Sure, you can argue that ancient wars were more often more intense, but the difference is one of degree, rather than anything fundamental.  You're the one splitting hairs by trying to rigidly separate these endlessly varied flavors of pre-modern warfare.

Also, what do you mean by chivalry?  Do you mean William the Marshal's war plan, explicitly lauded for its chivalry, of pretending to disband the English army, only to reform it quickly when the French do the same, and use the opportunity to lay waste to France unchecked?  There's nothing really incompatible in the medieval chivalric ethos with Mortal War; they're here to win, after all.  The goal of Edward III's campaigns in France was not loot/glory/prestige in any immediate sense; he sought to make an end to war by battle and so secure territories larger than any ancient city state, possibly even the throne of France itself.  This was not a chivalric promenade, but a ruthlessly calculated strategy of destruction.

&gt;I can't really see a case against a clear change in military systems. In just every regard, from battle tactics, overall strategies and the justifications given for war, to the types of men hired to wage them and the weapons they wielded; the differences between ancient warfare and medieval are vast. As are the changes in warfare between any era throughout history.  i.e.  The invention of the crossbow [...]

Yeah, we know that military systems in Europe changed between the ancient and medieval period; nobody is disputing that (except the bit about justifications for war/objectives).  What's being asked is why they changed to something that is seemingly less effective at mustering manpower, when we agree that a huge army of ancient style heavy infantry militia would have likely overpowered most medieval armies.  Flemish militia heavy infantry reduced the chivalry of France to dung and worms at Courtrai in 1302; the antique style had lost none of its effectiveness.  I'm legitimately certain there were very good reasons medieval armies were smaller, since I don't believe whole peoples stick with less effective systems for hundreds of years, but I think the reasons you've given are inadequate to explain the shift.

&gt;Medieval war objectives were fundamentally and profoundly different and didn't require the same numbers. 

Were they, though?  And did they not?  If we're defining medieval objectives as predation and territorial acquisition, that's very much in line with ancient wars, and the main determinant of force requirements  is the size of the enemy force.  There's no set bar of what numbers are 'required' for a give objective.  So you have two types of states with the same objectives, but for whatever reason the ancient states were driven to muster far larger armies, less their enemies overpower them.  This still isn't getting to the core question of how they did this and why medieval states *could* not.  The idea that medieval army sizes were 'big enough' for their objectives belies a fundamental misunderstanding of war.  Numerical superiority is to be regarded as fundamental, to be achieved in every instance to the greatest extent possible.  No medieval count is sitting there like 'My rival has about 1,000 men, I have about 1,000 men, that's enough to take X town, guess I'll settle for that even though I could raise 10,000 men from my territory and pursue a suitably grander prize.'  Forces available determine objectives in an interstate anarchy governed by strength, not the other way around.

&gt;As for sieges, my reasoning is simple. My distinction between the targets a medieval army engaged and the targets of an ancient host are that of population and size.

You vastly overestimate the size of ancient cities, using 400,000 as a representative number.  Many were quite large, but at the height of the Roman Empire, there were maybe three cities of this size: Rome, Alexandria, and Carthage.  Most ancient warfare was waged against 'cities' (the term denotes their political status, not so much their size) quite equivalent of medieval towns in size, be they average polises in Ancient Greece or the oppidia of central Europe.  If the number of armed citizens defending a city/town was a major concern, then most ancient armies wouldn't have been able to reduce defended cities.  Often times they weren't, but this inability wasn't a factor that limited their size one jot.  The Peloponnesian army that raged impotently outside the long walls of Athens couldn't reduce the city, but Greeks continued to use huge levies of their citizens despite this impotence.

Also, I think you'll find that Rheims very much was besieged during the campaigns of Edward III; he was unsuccessful, but more for logistical reasons than fear of the armed citizens.  Armed citizens did play a role in repelling the French assault on Paris in the later phase of the war, but the fact that it was attempted shows that even the largest cities in Western Europe were considered viable strategic targets, even for armies that paled in size compared to antiquity.  Moreover, the problem for Hannibal was not that the citizens of Rome would be too powerful for his army to overcome, but rather that the Romans had too many men in their field armies for him to mount a siege with secure lines of communication and protect his Italian allies.  

Regarding the larger point, though, I fear you're falling prey to circular logic.  Armies were too small to assault cities because leaders didn't want to assault cities, and they didn't want to because their armies were too small.  This situation is only tenable until someone decides to go for quantity, raising a large militia army to storm the walls like in antiquity.  If cities could arm so many townspeople as to make an attack by the seasoned knights and mercenaries untenable, why then did the attackers not bring their own horde of armed townspeople if they were available?  

&gt;Feudal wars lacked the national unity of ancient Rome, or Athens. Sources from the time openly discourse about how these wars are for the aristocracy's gain, or as a punitive measure, or ostensibly for wealth, as oppose to grandiose ideas of national stakes. 

Regarding internal unity, I'll point out that many, indeed most ancient states were oligarchic in character; monarchies and tyrannies were common as well.  As such, most ancient wars as well were fought for wealth and aristocratic gain as well.  Democracies like Athens and relatively open oligarchies like Rome (theoretically everyone was a citizen regardless of property, but not all their votes counted equally) were not really the norm in the classical world; regardless, these more exclusive states still mobilized immense armies despite a relatively small population base.  Thessalian states were mostly narrow oligarchies ruling over a class of serfes, and occupied an area not much bigger than Flanders, but under Iason of Pherai, mustered an army of 8,000 cavalry and at least 40,000 infantry.  The vast majority of these men would have had no political voice, but were still available to fight.  

'Mercenary' is increasingly recognized as being inadequate to describe Carthaginian armies; most of them were conscripts, compelled to fight by their home cities/tribes' subordination to Carthage.  In Africa, they had a system of garrisons and provincial governors to raise armies from the Berber population; in Iberia, the native peoples were forced to fight through hostage taking.  They did not freely join in order for pay, but as part of their duties to their superiors.  There's no 'unity of purpose' here, even the purpose of profit.*  Similarly, the Italians in the Punic Wars didn't really have 'national unity' in any sense we'd recognize; these were hundreds of distinct city states and hill tribes, compelled to serve Rome after succumbing to its superior power; many fought against the Romans when they got their chance.  The Peloponnesian League didn't have any kind of 'national unity' either; Sparta had overpowered its neighbors with superior numbers in the past and forced them to follow their lead in war and peace.  If internal unity was a prerequisite for large armies, pretty much none of the most powerful ancient states would have reached their heights.  

I don't know why ancient armies mustered such greater numbers than their medieval counterparts; I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, comparing arms, equipment, tactics, logistics, systems of mobilization, prominent campaigns, strategy, politics, population data, staple prices, wages, taxation, and so on.  So far, there's been no differences i can nail down that really explain this disparity in army size.  It's something I'm intently searching for, in my decidedly non-specialist way, but I don't think I've seen anyone nail it down yet.

He actually performed well, but that was still not enough to get out of groups. This MSI he was goddamn awful for most of the tournament, and him and CoreJJ had most straight up 2v2 deaths out of any bot lane. During RR he played like half of the games on Sona and kept missing his ults left and right. Against FNC (a game he played as an adc) he showcased how not to position during and after tf - his special. Certainly not a tournament I'd use as an argument to elevate him.

Secondly, you're comparing DL stats in NA to Rekkles stats in EU, that in itself is stupid. Outside of Zven there are no good adcs in NA (and even he's gotten much, much worse compared to his time in EU, as was seen during RR), and outside of CoreJJ there are no good supports there. TL has the best botlane hands down. TL is also the best team there and is rarely challenged, so obviously regardless of what DL picks, he's likely to have a positive record.  In LCS he could play Teemo and would still win probably, because TL is just better than all of NA teams, that doesn't mean his champion pool is big. If you look at his champion pool at international events, it's extremely shallow. He avoids champions he's used to picking in NA, because competition is much stronger, and even on his comfort picks he gets schooled more often than not.

Regarding Rekkles, in LEC spring not only Fnatic had a rough start, which obviously didn't work in favour of overall Rekkles' record on certain champions, but even if we take only 2nd part of the split into consideration, where Fnatic woke up and Rekkles also looked much better, there were 5 adcs (including Rekkles) that were legitimately fighting for the title of the best adc in EU. Also that retarded narrative of Rekkles small champion pool has got to go. His best champions are Trist, Sivir and Vayne, so obviously he's gonna play them the most if he aims to win, besides Rekkles has always been the late game insurance for Fnatic, and there is no better insurance than late game hyper carry. But he can also play Xayah, Ez, Twitch, Jinx, Cait, Kalista, Ashe (and back in the day Kennen), all at the world class level - the numbers back it up (all of those either near or above 60% wr, some like Kalista and Jinx go above 75%).

Regarding Rekkles' peak - he was a top 2 adc of the tournament last Worlds, and that was with Uzi and Deft playing there, so it's not like his competition was lacking. Rekkles peaks are also much higher than that of DL (multiple carry performances against best teams in the world, something DL can't write on his resume), and besides assuming, that Rekkles has already peaked is stupid. You may not realize it, because he's been a part of the pro scene for so long, but he's still only 22. DL is 26. Rekkles definitely still has room to grow, unlike DL.

And as for what DL would have to offer over Rekkles - enlighten me. DL is lane dominant but ONLY in NA (losing to EU and other international botlanes seems to be his fetish, on the other hand Rekkles has been wiping the floor with players like Deft on more than one occasion - Uzi seems to be his only weakness). His macro is much worse than that of Rekkles (2017 is the best year that showcased it, Rekkles was creating bigger pressure on the map than solo lanes of Fnatic, DL on the other hand has shown multiple times over the course of his career, that he has no idea where he should be on the map during certain situations), he brings unnecesary ego to the team (seen when he was playing for TSM, Bjerg was obviously a better player than him, yet the team kept playing around DL), he's only gonna get worse due to his age.

&amp;#x200B;

When Rekkles was on Alliance he was still only 17, it's really not fair to compare him to current Rekkles.

And don't get me wrong, I'd also like to see how DL would develop in EU, since he actually is very talented and got hold back by playing in NA, but it's too late for that.

Geography	

The village lies on the northwestern edge of the Volga plateau, in the extreme southeast of the Nizhny Novgorod oblast not far from the border with the Republic of Mordovia, almost 200 kilometres as the crow flies from the oblast capital of Nizhny Novgorod. The Rudnja River flows through Potschinki and flows a few kilometres north into the left tributary of the Sura River, the Alatyr. Potschinki is the administrative centre of the Potschinki rayon of the same name. The villages of Novospasskoye (7 km south), Dubrowo (13 km southwest) and Tagajewo (6 km west), the hamlets of Seljonaja Roschcha and Karmalei as well as the settlements of Ossinki and Penkosavoda are subordinated to the village of Potschinki in addition to the village of Potschinki.

 History 

In 1628, a village was first mentioned in place of today's Potschinki as the murderous village Anudemir or Potschinok Keuschtanow, which was destroyed by Tatars and therefore abandoned by the inhabitants. In 1647 the Moscow boyar Boris Morozov - one of the most influential and richest feudal lords of the time as the ""educator"" of the underage tsar Alexei I and de facto regent of Russia; he owned up to 274 villages and 40,000 serfs - bought the lands from the state and settled there from the Moscow surrounding countryside. This year is considered the founding year of the village, which was first called Nowo-Roschdestweno. Morozov set up a potash production plant in Potschinki, which grew significantly over the next 100 years. When in the middle of the 18th century the necessary forests of the surrounding area were cleared, potash production was stopped in 1760 and a large stud farm was founded at the instigation of Tsarina Elisabeth to supply the cavalry regiment of the imperial bodyguard (Konny leib-gwardii polk). In 1779 Potschinki was granted the town charter as the town of Ujesd Lukoyanov of the governorate of Nizhny Novgorod. In the following years the town was regularly built on according to a general plan. The coat of arms of the town, introduced in 1781, referred to the stud farm as the dominant economic enterprise of the town. Towards the end of the 19th century, the population of Pochinki more than quadrupled that of the Lukoyanov Ujesdv administrative centre. Nevertheless, the economic development of the town, which was situated away from the main transport routes such as the railway lines built in the second half of the century, stagnated. In 1922 Potschinki lost its town charter and has been Selo ever since. Today's population is only slightly higher than at the end of the 19th century. With the administrative reorganization after the foundation of the Nizhny Novgorod oblast in 1929, Potschinki became the administrative centre of a Rajon in the 1930s. 

Culture and Education	

In Potschinki, as a typical example of a Russian provincial small town of the 19th century, a number of buildings from this period are preserved. The stud farm complex from 1817 to 1825 is protected as a cultural and historical monument, but is in a poor state of preservation. Plans for restoration from the 1990s have not been implemented. 

Economy and Infrastructure

 Potschinki is the centre of an agricultural area with a number of agricultural processing and construction companies. The 250-year-old Potschinki stud farm, one of the oldest in Russia, where, among other things, the Soviet cold-blooded breed was newly bred in the 20th century, is currently insolvent and is on the verge of dissolution due to unclear ownership. Several natural gas pipelines cross at Potschinki. In 2007, construction began on the Potschinki - Grjasowez pipeline, which will initially stabilise the gas supply to northwest Russia and serve as a supply line to the Nord Stream pipeline to western Europe, and later on with the completion of a new pipeline from the Yamal Peninsula to northwest Russia in the opposite direction to the supply to central Russia. The nearest railway station is located at the Uschowka settlement, a good ten kilometres to the north, on the line from Rusajewka via Arsamas to Nizhny Novgorod (line kilometre 119), which was opened on this section in 1901. The R178 highway, which connects Nizhny Novgorod with Saratov via the murderous capital Saransk and Penza, runs through Pochinki",True,False,False,,0,1562059112,,False,0,{},eskc03s,False,t3_c82amt,False,True,t3_c82amt,/r/geography/comments/c82amt/i_posted_this_image_three_weeks_ago_answer_in_the/eskc03s/,False,,1571246248,2,True,[],False,geography,t5_2qnms,r/geography,public,0,
[],,Drooperdoo,1239587693.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3g0iw,False,[],"I never see studies that reflect my political views (because my views are not mainstream). 

I hold with historian Alvin Toffler that the world is NOT run by ideology. That is to say, there are no ""Capitalist countries"" or ""Communist countries,"" or anything like that. The world is moved more by technological shifts than by the pronunciamentos of philosophers. The 20th Century was the culmination of a few centuries of the Industrial Revolution. Both America and the USSR were shaped by the same historical process and shared the same core beliefs: 1) A linear conception of history, whose guiding idea is an unwavering belief in endless ""Progress,"" 2) The unquestioning conviction in industrialization and ""growth,"" 3) the dogma that colonizing the world is great for the rest of the planet, 4) the view that all power must be centralized, taken from the people and reposed in the hands of a ruling bureaucracy, and 5) The stance that a welfare state must be used to pacify an every-poorer population, as greater and greater social control is exerted using technology to manipulate the masses.

We've long since shifted away from the capitalist period. There is no ""free market"". Likewise, Communism was clumsy beta-testing for the real goal: Technocracy. (Both capitalist countries and so-called communist countries were trending toward the same end-goal.) 

We're watching Technocracy rolled out now in China, where they're doing the final beta-testing with the social credit system. Corporations like Apple and Facebook helped them enact it, and are slowly bringing the concepts and technologies West. Which is why we're now seeing all this social control and censorship on the internet in America and Western Europe. It's not about ""combating hate,"" but about setting up an authoritarian grid that can punish you for wrong-think. (And of course the ideas they're punishing you for are not laws anywhere: They're edicts and belief-systems that the shadow-rulers have legislated in invisible ink. It's a control network set up entirely outside of government. Rule-by-Oligarch.)

The Church (you're told) will no longer provide your morality; corporations will. 

You can curse religion all day long with no consequences, but cross a company's ""corporate values"" and you'll find yourself out of a job, blacklisted and starving.

Sorry for the long rant, but no: I no longer consider myself a conservative (by what modern Americans refer to as ""mainstream conservatism""). Nor do I see myself as a Progressive (that movement long since having capitulated to Wall Street). Where once they championed the Working Class, now they're the brownshirts of the oligarch class, enforcing ""corporate values"" on Traditional Americans. Getting them ready for absorption by the Industrial-Economic system (which does not want traditions tying people to the past.) It's why there's a conscious assault on the Family and an irrational obsession on ""rooting out race consciousness"" [which in reality is an awareness of one's own culture and traditions]. The past must be expunged at all costs, for people to be made ""blank slates"" for the new globalist utopia being prepared for them by the Corporate Elite. 

Both the political left and right are irrelevant movements by this point. They're used to distract the public while the REAL governance grid is being installed. 

So phony debates take place as distractions . . . with quasi-conservatives extolling the virtues of capitalism and ""debunking"" leftists on socialism. And progressives rambling on about Karl Marx and ""democratic socialism"". (When in fact, both systems are dead.) As I said: It's a distraction. 

The future age is opening up toward Technocracy . . . and no one is fighting it. Both left and right believe in it. The right admires ""innovation"" (because they see it as the source of wealth-creation) and the left likes the idea of total social control.

""The Fascist Manifesto was proclaimed in 1919 by Alceste De Ambris and Filippo Tommaso Marienetti. In their pamphlet, the authors called for an eight-hour workday and a minimum wage;

All that is written here is true. What is not mentioned is that both authors of the manifesto started to get problems with the fascist movement, because, as we all should have learned in history classes, Fascists are not actually interested in keeping the many promises they make, but only in gaining and maintaining power. 

De Ambris soon denounced the fascist movement and was forced into exile, where he kept writing against fascism and organised with anti-fascist organisations. Marienetti also left the party in protest a year later, altough his connections to the later fascist regime remain to some extend.

&gt; it demanded worker representation in industrial management and equal standing of trade unions, industrial executives, and public servants.""

It is true that this was demanded in the early manifesto. Other demands included:

	- Universal suffrage (including women!)
	- Proportional representation 
	- Elected National councils
	- Strongly decreased military
	- Peaceful foreing policy

It is also true that those demands look like they come from a communist party. That's because those demands were, together with the 8 hour work day, minimum wage, etc., at that time, considered to be radically leftist ideas.

The reason why fascist movements brought up those seemingly opposed ideas is relatively simple. Socialism was extremely popular in Europe at the time, many people, especially business owners, where getting very scared of a socialist revolution. Fascists tried to make themselves more popular by using those very popular demands while at the same time standing behind corporate interests.

It's very similar with German Fascists, who called themselves ""National Socialists"", despite them putting socialists in concentration camps as soon as they gained power.

The problem here is that you're mixing up personal performance and team result in a way that it'd always not favor DL. You'd say his best performance was in MSI last year (but will say he choked internationally because TL finished 4th). Now this year TL finished 2nd and beat IG, you'd say that he played awful on personal level (despite 10/0/8 and 9/2/10 performance on 2 of the wins vs IG). You're just unwilling to give him any credit. 

&gt; Secondly, you're comparing DL stats in NA to Rekkles stats in EU, that in itself is stupid.

No. I'm comparing Rekkles stats in EU+RR vs DL stats in NA+MSI+RR. Rekkles has 70% win-rate, DL has 67% win-rate which is pretty fair, if not favoring Rekkles. But hey, it's *stupid* LOL

&gt;  If you look at his champion pool at international events, it's extremely shallow. He avoids champions he's used to picking in NA, because competition is much stronger, and even on his comfort picks he gets schooled more often than not.

DL's picks for MSI 2019: Kaisa, Varus, Lucian, Sona, Vayne, Sivir, Ashe. That's 7 of the Top 9 of his picks in total for S9 (Xayah and Ashe are the other 2). He didn't suddenly pick only his shallow comfort picks like you claimed.

&gt; His best champions are Trist, Sivir and Vayne, so obviously he's gonna play them the most if he aims to win, besides Rekkles has always been the late game insurance for Fnatic, and there is no better insurance than late game hyper carry.

So why didn't he play any Vayne when Trist/Sivir were banned by IG? Xayah was his third choice at worlds, but he picked Jhin and Ez instead for the first 2 games and finished very badly at 1/2/3. FYI, his Vayne is 0% win-rate vs international team. Maybe he's the one lacking confidence to pick Vayne vs international team? Compared to DL who actually did pick Vayne and win vs IG in MSI.

&gt; But he can also play Xayah, Ez, Twitch, Jinx, Cait, Kalista, Ashe (and back in the day Kennen), all at the world class level - the numbers back it up (all of those either near or above 60% wr, some like Kalista and Jinx go above 75%).

This is prime example of meaningless exaggeration. Xayah and Ezreal are the only two relevant champions.

* Twitch: 53% played once (3/5/1 in a loss vs OG) since 2017
* Jinx: played once (0/3/0 in a loss vs G2) since 2015
* Caitlin: 57% played once since 2016
* Kalista: played once since 2016 (last 2 games were both losses)
* Ashe: last played in 2017 (2 out of 3 last games were losses)
* Xayah: consistently good
* Ezreal: 54% (5-5 in the last 10 games)

How can you say Rekkles can play those champions *at world class level* if most of them hadn't been played for 2 years or more? 1 game of Jinx in 4 years in a loss and you say he can play Jinx at world class level? Are you being fair?


I'll add two more champions:

* Lucian is Rekkles' second most played champion, and that's at an absurd **43%** win-rate. 
* Jhin is Rekkles' fifth most played champion, and at an even worse **40%** win-rate.

Isn't it bad that 2 of this Top 5 most played champions have negative win-loss record?

&gt; Alvvays is a dreampop band formed in Toronto, Canada in 2011.

&gt; Reverb-drenched and bittersweet, Alvvays members Molly Rankin and Kerri MacLellan were childhood friends, who began playing music with Alec O'Hanley while in high school.  Lead vocalist Molly Rankin is the daughter of John Morris Rankin from the popular Canadian folk family group the Rankin Family. Molly Rankin released a solo EP titled ""She EP"" in 2010 and then in 2011 formed Alvvays with MacLellan, O'Hanley, and new members Brian Murphy and Phil MacIsaac.

&gt; Following tours with The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and Peter Bjorn and John, the group recorded a full-length album, Alvvays, which was released by Royal Mountain Records (Canada), Polyvinyl Records (US), and Transgressive Records (Europe) in July 2014.  Chad VanGaalen, John Agnello, and Graham Walsh of Holy Fuck all contributed to the album's production.  Simon Vozick-Levinson, writing in Rolling Stone, called the eponymous album an ""indie-pop wonder"".  Alvvays went to #1 on US college charts on August 5, 2014. Read more on Last.fm.

It is making steady progress in isolating democratic Taiwan by offering economic incentives to developing countries like El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Burkina Faso, which previously did not recognize Beijing.

&gt;  ## Rattazzi sobre el acuerdo: ""Prefiero los autos europeos a los brasileños porque son mejores""
&gt; 
&gt; 04:18
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   2 de julio de 2019 • 02:27
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; A días de la firma del [acuerdo entre la Unión Europea y el Mercosur](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/acuerdo-mercosur-union-europea-tid66817) , el CEO de [Fiat](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/fiat-tid51410) Argentina, [Cristiano Rattazzi](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/cristiano-rattazzi-tid53220) , habló del temor que tienen algunos de que recibamos [una invasión de vehículos europeos](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/industria-automotriz-tid66247) . ""Tenemos una invasión de vehículos brasileños, por lo tanto es mejor tener europeos que probablemente son de mejor calidad y hasta más baratos"", opinó en diálogo con el panel [Terapia de Noticias.](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/terapia-de-noticias-tid58322) ""Es muy saludable para la Argentina que se abra un poco más"".
&gt; 
&gt; El entrevistado consideró que ahora el país debe focalizarse en ""crear competitividad para la cadena de producción argentina"". Tal como señaló: ""Si queremos crear competitividad, no puede haber algo que salga 20% más caro que en el resto del mundo porque no vamos a poder exportar a nadie o tendremos que llevar el dólar 25% arriba y eso no tiene ningún sentido lógico y económico para el país. Toda la cadena va a tener que adaptarse"".
&gt; 
&gt; Para él, se deben hacer múltiples cambios en el modo en que hoy se realizan las cosas en el país, por más de que el camino para lograr esto sea difícil y haya que afrontar resistencias. En línea con esto, Rattazzi dijo que sería favorable para el país que se flexibilice el sector laboral, que se realice una reforma previsional ""para que sea sustentable en el tiempo"" y que se aplique la reforma tributaria. ""Sacó muchos impuestos distorsivos, pero todavía no se aplica. Hasta volvieron las retenciones, que es un absurdo, pero había una emergencia y en emergencias se pueden hacer muchísimas cosas"", señaló en [LN+](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/ln-tid58215) .
&gt; 
&gt; Al analizar el panorama electoral, el empresario contó que le tiene ""mucha estima"" a Alberto Fernández, aunque criticó: ""Un grupo vivía de bolsos tirados en los conventos, millones de dólares en cajas de seguridad, medio campo argentino e inversiones en Miami de altísima calidad. Yo no entiendo cómo 30% de argentinos, sin siquiera mirar qué opciones hay y qué futuro puede haber, dicen que los votan igual. Son Alí Babá y los 40 ladrones, no importa"".

I doubt SE was surprised by this response. It was predictable.

I'm talking about open borders. Open borders allows legal entry to a country which makes gaining legal aid easier.

&gt; Wishing and hoping or wanting something really doesn't change reality. A person could work for 3 years in Sierra Leone without spending a penny on subsistence and still not earn enough money for a single one way plane ticket to the US, ignoring if they have a family.

Human trafficking services that demand. Look to the EU migrant crisis. There are migrants in the EU who are from central Africa. These people who cannot afford plane tickets to Europe, yet there they are. So what you've said is impossible has already happened.

&gt; If someone is resourceful enough to overcome that and get to the us anyway, why on earth wouldn't you want people like that??

a) It props up a human trafficking industry and b) They do no respect the laws of your country if they are an illegal immigrant.

&gt; And the population of Europe as a whole is over half a billion. Something tells me your scales seem off. 

That's not why I'm mentioning the thousands dying in the Mediterranean. I'm talking about the dire consequence of creating an incentive to travel somewhere. 

&gt; Incidentally, if you were to have open borders, human traffickers instantly go from being something nefarious to effectively a job temp agency.

Human trafficking is the the slavery of the 21st century, it is a MASSIVE human rights issue. It shouldn't be taken lightly.
It has little to do with the legality of the border. It has everything to with people being incentivized to travel but being unable to afford the legal means to do it. 
Human trafficking is a disgusting industry that hurts millions of people.

&gt; You've yet to demonstrate any substantial risks beyond ""people hate immigrants so shit will be bad with a lot of them"".

I'm not talking about citizens in America. I'm talking about potential immigrants. If we open borders the incentive to travel to America just went up this now offsets the risk of being human trafficked.

&gt; Oh. So. Not very rapidly at all then. The US's population in 1900 was about 100 million people. It's over 300 million people today. 

That's not the point I'm making. I'm telling you that migration of people is not always a good thing. Because in the case of Germany it was not. Even when the number of migrants was relatively small.

In regards to the USA, it needed to grow and by extension it had the provisions to support that growth. Why do you think it controlled the border in the end? Because too much growth too quick can be bad if you cannot support it. You seem to be of the opinion that it is ALWAYS good no matter what, which just isn't true. I'm making the case that it CAN be bad. This is why I'm talking about Germany, those migrants caused massive strain to the country because they did not have the infrastructure initially to deal with it.

&gt; At that rate it would take 90 years for Germany to double its population. The US obliterated that rate. Not to mention China or India.

Yes and that tells you everything you need to know. Germany struggled and the rate was exceptionally low. That indicates that the threshold for the amount of migrants is affected by a lot of variables. Such as the type of economy, the state of the global economy, the efficiency of the public services, the nature of those services etc.
You can gear up a country into taking in huge number of migrants. I'm not disputing that. My point with Germany is that they tried to do this and it failed because it is a fundamentally a risky play. Not acknowledging that risk gets people hurt.

&gt; Have you ever spent time with refugees? I know a catering company run by some Syrian refugee women

Why are you talking about refugees? I'm not against refugees or immigration. I'm against illegal and uncontrolled immigration.
People are people everywhere, that includes all the bad things too. Cultures are not created equally. Open borders means you let in just as much bad as you let in good. Rape gangs, sexual assaults on women, retrograde opinions about our legal system. There is a complete package and all of those things should be taken into account.

&gt; The US economy is propped up on the housing market never declining. Like that was the whole problem with the housing crisis

Yes and increasing the supply of houses for x number of immigrants will decrease houses prices, i.e. the market will shrink in a short period. All it takes is for that X number to be big enough over a certain time period, and there goes the American economy. Or the opposite happens, demand for houses explodes and the prices raise. Houses cannot be built fast enough to service the demand and inequality skyrockets.  

&gt; Really disengenious to compare conquest to immigration. No, immigrants aren't invaders trying to set up their own sovereign entity on the land you inhabit, and if you refuse, they will kill you. 

Why do you think that happened? One major aspect is that the native Americans were so culturally distinct from the Europeans. It's not simply a matter of conquest. Different cultures will resent one another because they are incompatible. This is the elephant in the room in Europe. In Sweden, migrants from the crisis attend mandatory training where they have to be taught how to treat women. That isn't sustainable if X number of people come over over a certain time period is too big.

&gt; In a country of 300 million, which grew to that size from 100 in 100 years, you've failed to indicate any ""too fast"" rate. 

Because I don't know what that rate is but I can guess. What's important is that there IS a threshold.

&gt; No, I was being glib. There's a difference. Primarily, in that all of this is scalable, and indeed, needs to be scalable for the system to work as intended.

You are making an argument for unrestrained free markets. Yes if demand is high, supply will eventually meet it. But take this example.
Dump 10,000 hungry people into a cafe. That cafe can meet the demands of those 10,000 people eventually, but in the first day/week/month/year all their food will be gone, and 90% of the people will still be hungry.
The worst case is if too much demand is placed on the cafe it will shut down.
Again, it's a rate of change argument. I'm not arguing that free markets don't self regulate, it's how they self regulate and what the hidden costs are that are important.

&gt; There isn't a set limit no matter how you slice it. 

Yes there is. I do not understand your argument here at all. If X number of immigrants cost the government Y amount and that Y amount is enough to bankrupt the country then there is obviously a limit. 

&gt; None of those things are even remotely fundamentally limited or set to ""run out"" with our current world population. 

Oh come on now for goodness sake. You can physically house 100 million people in the Sahara desert. That doesn't mean it's possible. You know why? Because the systems we live in have limitations. This is basic economics.
Take the house example, if we are going to build 100 million houses we need tonnes of construction material. The construction industry only services the current demand in America. So it only has the supply that meets that demand. Yes there is enough supply in the known universe, but getting that supply costs money. So, no company stockpiles more resources than the demand requires because it would incur unnecessary costs. This is just one industry. But industries are interlinked. When a demand is placed on one it is inherently placed on others. What about the logistics industry? The legal industry? The knock on effects could be dire and it only takes one link in the chain to fail for it all to fail. All it takes is the strain being a certain amount.

&gt; This.... is utter wild fantasy. ""Seize power by trying to control the border""? Wtf?

And it is the exact reason I make this argument. Unrestrained free markets result in Governments (i.e. a monopoly of power). Unrestrained borders result in cultural monopolies. America essentially had open borders which allowed 100s of millions of people to settle there. You know what happened? A cultural monopoly. They were no longer, German, British, Irish or whatever, they became culturally American. You know what that cultural monopoly did? It shut the border.

&gt; Los Angeles and Tuscon Arizona share profoundly different cultures and yet you don't see Arizona trying to ban California residents or the other way around. 

No they aren't profoundly different. Someone who thinks women should be stoned for adultery and someone who thinks women should have equal rights are profoundly different. You are being disingenuous 

&gt; Are you telling me you expect the US to break apart as states try to prevent residents from other states to immigrate?

No because they aren't profoundly different. If they were, then yes they would, but fundamentally they are American.

In terms of working out a rate that would cause a collapse let's take Germany as rudimentary example because we have numbers.

In 2015 when 900,000 asylum seekers entered the country it costs Germany 16 billion euros, which was 0.5% of it's GDP.
Let's be generous, let's say if it's expenditure is equal to 50% of its GDP major issues will occur. This means in 1 year, Germany can take on roughly 100 million migrants before dire consequences. That's a lot, but it's still an obvious limit. Bare in mind that this is generous. 

If it costs them 5% of their GDP it would likely make a serious dent into their economy. That's only 10 million people or 11% of their current population. That is certainly a real possibility given that Germany's border isn't even open. If it were I'd imagine we could potentially see these numbers. Is it worth the risk? And is ignoring that risk worth it ?",True,False,False,,0,1562067610,,1562068038,0,{},eskl2pp,False,t3_c7iidg,False,True,t1_esjrzsh,/r/changemyview/comments/c7iidg/cmv_most_all_arguments_against_immigration_are/eskl2pp/,False,,1571252941,1,True,[],False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,0,

&gt; Some lawmakers refused to stand as a jazz ensemble started playing the EU&amp;#039;s anthem - Beethoven&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Ode to Joy&amp;#039; - while others, notably from Britain&amp;#039;s Brexit Party, turned their backs on the proceedings.

&gt; Since Britain&amp;#039;s government and parliament have failed to agree on a Brexit deal, a hasty campaign was organized and the Brexit Party now takes up most of Britain&amp;#039;s European Parliament seats - at least until the U.K. withdraws for good.

&gt; While Brexit Party lawmakers briefly turned their backs in protest, pro-EU legislators donned yellow &amp;quot;Stop Brexit&amp;quot; t-shirts instead. Yet Britain&amp;#039;s departure is just one of many challenges facing the EU&amp;#039;s new legislature.

No meu término, assim como no seu, não houve motivo para “ódio” no final, sentamos, conversamos, tentei reatar e ela não quis, depois disso nunca mais nos falamos, mesmo que nada disso tivesse sido combinado.

Esse tipo de término é o melhor, mas o mais sofrido, pq fica difícil lembrar das coisas ruins. A todo momento os bons momentos vem à tona e a garganta volta a apertar de saudade de um tempo que no fundo, sabemos que não vai voltar.

Fiquei uma bons 6 meses de luto total, não quis fazer nada da vida praticamente e, só lá no fim que comecei a sair com amigos e a conhecer gnt nova. Era em graça, pq nada tinha a mesma cor de antes, ninguém era tão interessante e ficar em casa sempre parecia mais proveitoso, mas mesmo assim, faz parte voltar a ter sua identidade e é preciso forçar um pouco a ter contato social.

Teve gente que falou sobre substituir o que sente por ela, por outra pessoa. Eu não te recomendo fazer isso. O melhor ao meu ver é buscar o seu eu interior que está todo misturado a sua ex, você agr não sabe onde termina e onde ela começa, relações fazem isso e essa confusão de não saber o que fazer agr tem tudo a ver com isso.

Buscar outra pessoa agir só iria te transferir um problema que uma hora precisa ser resolvido.
Sem querer, comecei uma amizade com uma garota da faculdade e acabamos nos aproximando muito, os dois meio sozinhos, então nós entendíamos muito bem, só que naquele momento de fragilidade que eu estava, criei uma paixão que não tinha muita base, ao mesmo tempo que não havia sequer esquecido minha ex. Vê como não adianta tentar substituir?!

No fim eu consegui perceber que tava viajando demais e me afastei ela, ao mesmo tempo que meu luto acabava e me vi descobrindo minha identidade e livre de sentimentos pelas duas (guardado as devidas proporções).

Enfim, demora, demora muito para que tudo passe, um término é como uma morte, nos passamos pelo momento de luto e ele varia de pessoa para pessoa, mas passa!

The migrants are persecuted minorities. 

They are imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities. 

They are not providing forced labor or awaiting execution, but take note of the “sometimes” qualifier.

Also six people have died in ICE custody and ICE lost 1500 children. 

Who knows what happened to those children. Dead? Human trafficking? Living on the streets? Living with strangers?

""Canada will also establish ""targets"" for companies that manufacture or sell plastics to be responsible for their plastic waste.

Currently less than 10% of plastic used in Canada gets recycled.

Mr Trudeau called the issue of plastic pollution a ""global challenge"".

In May, the United Nations said 180 countries reached a deal to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the world's oceans, where it can harm fish, sea turtles, whales and other wildlife.

Marine animals can become entangled in larger plastics - particularly cord, nets and ropes from fishing.

While European and North American countries tend to produce a lot of plastic waste per capita, their management of that waste limits the impact of that product on the ocean compared to other regions, according to research out of the UK.

The Canadian government has yet to decide which single-use plastic products will be included on the list but it could target plastic bags, straws, cutlery, plates and stir sticks.

About 3m tonnes of plastic waste is thrown away each year in the country.""",True,False,False,,0,1562072215,,False,0,{},eskrspl,False,t3_c86og1,False,True,t3_c86og1,/r/solarpunk/comments/c86og1/canada_to_ban_single_use_plastic_items_item_list/eskrspl/,False,,1571256133,3,True,[],False,solarpunk,t5_34bsb,r/solarpunk,public,0,

Some more detail about the situation (didn't want to make the post too long). I'm designing a strategy board game where you can choose different nations in the 1800s to play as. Since the game is based off of warfare using the top technology and techniques at the time (rifles, lines of infantry, canons, etc.) most of the nations that could work with that were European. I was telling him that I wanted to included more non-European nations, particularly Brazil. Most (I of course can't say ""all"" with 100% certainty) of the top brass then were of mostly if not all Portuguese decent, people who would be considered ""white."" And while I do see and appreciate the ideas some people commented about race, the person I was talking to was had the idea of European = white South American = not white. I lived in Brazil (Curitiba) and people differentiated between races (white, black, and other) all the time. Unfortunately sometimes with racist intent but others with no racism, just differentiating. (Any Brazilians please let us know what you think!)

I was there for work during their Independence Day in spring a couple of years ago and in Athens they had tanks, heavy mechanized weapons platforms, a huge number of uniformed rifle bearing soldier.

Honestly the difference in whether the main secular holiday has a strong martial tone seems to me to be based on whether it is an armed revolution/war being marked. The US achieved independence by war and armed citizen uprising  combined. France similarly through one major  armed revolution. Greece got its independence  from ottomans by arms.

Japan and Germany did not achieve rigjts or their current liberties through their own military or use of force by their citizenry but by its defeat so they would not have a military parade . Neither would Canada or Australia who achieved political independence through the colonizing g empire’s decision  or ascent.

Look I don’t agree with introducing tanks,  I’d rather a float and reverence for othe bill of rights ok? I am just pointing out that the fourth of July has many martial aspects at its core. The national anthem of the US is literally and exclusively  a BATTLE Hymn (albeit actually a 1812 war one) — while “Oh Canada” is not and fireworks are quite directly a simulation of artillery. 

Rally it is simple, by and large there certainly is more of a martial element in the main celebration for nations that got independence and/or revolutionary shifts due to their use force

He isn’t a point getter, but look for him to quarter back your penalty kill, he is an extremely responsible defensive forward. Hardly takes penalties. Hope that helps? 

Also speaks Swedish due his time in Sweden’s pro leagues as well as French and English, so both the team and the media people are gonna love him.

 What else? He’s a ‘late bloomer’ in that he came to Flyers as a 29 year old rookie, but had had Caps scouts look into him when he was 19, got told by his GM that the only French players that made the NHL were Québécois, and to give up hope. Quit hockey to enroll in med school to be a chiropractor until he got an invite to the Swedish pro leagues, which disappointed his single parent, his mom. Started learning Swedish using chiropractic textbooks, because it was convenient and because he got sick of being chirped in a language he didn’t know. 

Hmm. And... The Blackhawks invited him to try out when he was 26 but it didn’t work out, schedule wise.

About your plan to implement 3rd party pixels - I'd be very careful in these GDPR days, as I understand - it should be clear in your TOS that you share this anon data with 3rd party companies. I'd consult someone of knowledge within that field as for how to cover yourself.

There are better ways to do so - Using a DMP or other tool, to segment your users and only allow advertisers to use them as a target audience, and not control all of it. That way you can also earn more of it (finding highly converting segments for certain advertisers).

About your problem with assigning value to conversions for google ads - I wouldn't go let this stop you. IMO it's a too granular method anyway - I'd try some high-intent, high-volume keywords and lead to your best performing landing page that are related.

Create 3  variations of ads for each ad group and don't forget ad extensions - they'll improve your CTR dramatically and there for lower your costs.

Budget obviously depends on the average CPC of your keywords.

I'd go with enough for 200-300 clicks, and see where I stand.

That way it would be much easier to scale when you succeed.

Regarding ad networks - Since you are being refused by the global once, maybe see if the abroad traffic contains a lot of users in certain countries, and try reaching out to local networks there. Maybe there are networks that works all over Europe or something similar.

You can also try specific affiliate offers for those countries and use banner ads for them.

About Pinterest - are you only working on organic traffic or are you using ads as well?

In either case (I can talk mostly for ads) you should try Instagram, too - much more scalable.

I'm especially concerned that relationships between people from different countries are often split apart by borders and immigration rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

From a more Marxist perspective open borders are a useful tool against global labour arbitrage. When people in one part of the world can be paid significantly less for the same work, capital is able to exploit this and make enormous super-profits. Something like 20% of Apple's profits are attributable to their employing Chinese, rather than American workers. Or rather, if Apple had to employ American workers, they would lose 20% of their profits. This situation arises in part because capital is extremely mobile but labour is not. Chinese workers cannot easily move to higher wage countries, or even between regions in China but capital can. Increasing the mobility of labour limits the ability of capital to achieve these super-profits by exploiting differences in labour costs, it increases the power of labour relative to capital, which Marxists should allows lean toward. The effect would be a tendency toward a global equalisation of wages but because the power of labour is increased it would also likely lead to higher wages overall.

&amp;#x200B;

How this plays out in practical reality, though, is more complicated. Assuming that the decision is being made by the government of one country, rather than a global agreement, the consequences may be different. If that country is in the global North, you would see greater immigration from the South which would likely not be enough to make a considerable difference to the wages and power of Chinese workers, considering there are still several hundred million peasants who can be drafted into the Chinese industrial labour market, far more than could conceivable move to one single wealthier country, even the US. There are also the practical limitations, you can open the borders but it's still going to be the wealthier people from the South who are able to afford to physically move from one country to the other. Generally, though, I think we could see such an effort in one country as part of a global move toward free movement, individual countries rarely move in one direction on their own. If Germany, for example, decided to open its borders, it would likely be on the back of a movement that exists across Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

If it's in the global South, it's hard to see what political-economic benefit this would have. I'd still support this for humanist reasons though.

He did fight for small-c communism in Spain during the Civil War. In 1936, he joined an anti-Stalinist Marxist militia that was allied to the much larger militia of the anarcho-syndicalist labor unions. They had a revolution centered around Barcelona, where factories and farms and other productive property were collectivized to be controlled directly by the workers. 

Orwell, his militia, and the revolution were all suppressed when the government of the Republic (their ally against the Fascists) betrayed them. 

The Republic had fallen more and more under Soviet influence, as major Western democracies like Britain and France remained neutral out of fear of a wider European war. The only two countries to help the Republic were the Soviet Union and Mexico, though tens of thousands of volunteers from dozens of nations flocked to the Republic to form the International Brigades, and thousands of others joined the anarchists. Meanwhile, Germany and Italy provided heavy military support for Franco and the Fascists.

Stalin was courting alliances with the West due to his fears about Germany, and wanted to demonstrate that he wasn’t fomenting revolution in Western Europe. Therefore, as the Communist Party gained influence in the Republican government, it allied with pro-capitalist forces to betray and attack the anarchists, de-collectivize the economy, and hand the property back to the old land-owners and businesses. During this time, they made false allegations that Orwell’s P.O.U.M. militia were secret fascists and suppressed it. Orwell, who had been shot through the neck by the Fascists on the front and so was back in Barcelona, had to go underground to escape the purge. Many of his friends and compatriots could not escape it. The infighting weakened the anti-Fascist cause and Franco ultimately prevailed, ruling Spain into the 1970s. 

This purge, and how he observed that the foreign press, including leftist publications, blindly printed the government line on everything, formed the core of his beliefs and writing motivations that would eventually become *Animal Farm* and *Nineteen Eighty-Four*. He remained a committed socialist for the rest of his days, though on his deathbed he gave the British government a list of names of people who he believed were sympathetic to the USSR. Many modern socialists view this “naming of names” as a betrayal, which could have led to government suppression of those individuals, when Orwell himself was ostensibly against governments cracking down on people for their political views. He was certainly a complicated character.

He wrote about the Spanish Revolution in his memoir of his time in the war, *Homage to Catalonia*. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

'Course you don't.  That's because Nichiren Shoshu is 100% of your *own* religious views.  

Japan has some 44.835 *million* Buddhists, according to a 2008 study (using 2008 population numbers).  That means that the Nichiren Shoshu membership you gave, assuming it was the same in 2008, is only 1.3% of the total number of Buddhists in Japan.

#That's FRINGE.

Especially when it's claiming to be the only *valid* religion: ""TRUE Buddhism"".  The largest two groups are Pure Land and Zen, but that's hardly surprising - it's rare to see the offshoot surpass the original.  And Nichiren simply ripped off the Pure Land model, substituting a secondary chant for the primary one.  Interestingly, it appears that the Nichiren religions and the Soka Gakkai are just about neck and neck, but even among the *Nichiren* religions, Nichiren Shoshu has a very small number compared to Nichiren Shu, and most of the sources don't count Rissho Kosei Kai in with the Nichiren schools, though it is Nichiren based, as they now strip off Soka Gakkai from the Nichiren schools (both those are new religions).  Rissho Kosei Kai had a period when it was a lay organization of Nichiren Shu but split off; it recently reported 6.5 *MILLION* members.  That's TEN TIMES the (already overstated) total you reported for Nichiren Shu, and Rissho Kosei Kai is one of those nasty little NEW religions! 

I'm not buying the ""600,000"" because Nichiren Shoshu has *ALWAYS* exaggerated its membership numbers.  To be fair, [they all do it](https://i.imgur.com/srSFsES.png?1).  In 2010, Nichiren Shū described itself as a ""religious organization consisting of about 5,000 temples, 8,000 ministers and 3.8 million members worldwide.""  Most of those will be in Japan, as with Nichiren Shoshu.  But compared to Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu is a paltry 15.8% of their size; if combined, Nichiren Shoshu comprises just 13.6% of the total.  Add in Rissho Kosei Kai and Soka Gakkai (I'm counting just 8.5 million SG members in Japan), and Nichiren Shoshu is now just 3.1% of the total Nichiren believers.  So that's a *VERY* small proportion of the overall Nichiren community, and ""fringe"" is defined as follows:

&gt;a group that is on the periphery of a larger organization because its views are more extreme than the majority [Source](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/fringe-group)

That certainly fits Nichiren Shoshu, doesn't it?  None of the *other* Nichiren sects revere the Dai-Gohonzon; Nichiren Shu doesn't hold that Nichiren is the ""TRUE Buddha"" (they just call him Nichiren Shonin), and Nichiren **Sho**shu means ""ORTHODOX Nichiren school"", referring to their hardline orthodoxy.

&gt;the outer or less important part of an area, group, or activity: one that represents the views of a small number of people [Source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/fringe)

That definition certainly fits as well.

So, yes, it's fringe.  The members of the fringe group *always* reject that designation because they fancy themselves the most important group, and the *reason* they're the most important is because THEY'RE *RIGHT!* About *EVERYTHING!*

&gt;Did you know or forget that thousands of uniform believers go to the Head Temple each year? Globally?

So what?  Thousands of uniform believers (in uniforms) go on the Soka Gakkai's NEW ""tozan"" trips to visit Gakkai HQ in Tokyo; thousands of uniform believers visit the SGI-USA's FNCC facility from across the 50 states every year; and thousands of uniform believers across Europe visit the SGI-UK's Taplow Court facility, that new SGI-Italy facility, Trets (at least they *used* to), and whatnot.  I'm just waiting for SGI to start launching ""Buddhist cruises"".

*This is what religions do.* The fact that Nichiren Shoshu does it does not make Nichiren Shoshu different or special - these religions are ALL doing it.

&gt;Other ordinary Buddhists do not even visit Tibet regularly or the other Buddhist temples on consistent pilgrimage, much less practice regimentedly because they often only treat Buddhism like a Yoga or Pilates alternative for westernized therapy.

MeeYOW!  Are all the Nichiren Shoshu members as catty^**1** and superior as you?

&gt;But Please spare me the sanctimonious defense that SGI members are dippity-great and somehow deemed without courtesy when we call a “spade a spade” and only the SGI leaders are wicked. Both categories act deplorably or are you blind to all the testimonies on this forum of SGI members vis a vis?

Please go read the top post on our main page, [FAQ - please read (especially if you are a faithful SGI member or Nichiren follower)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/ba8rmq/faq_please_read_especially_if_you_are_a_faithful/) right now.  You need to answer this for yourself:

&gt;If you are a ... **devoted Nichiren follower**, *why are you here?* This isn't the right site for you.  Why not find a site that exists to *promote* ... Nichiren and post whatever it is over *there* instead?  The type of content described above is not appropriate for a site specifically designed to support *former* SGI members, *current* SGI members who are questioning their SGI involvement, and people *considering* joining SGI.  In our capacity and function as the ""Consumer Reports"" for SGI (**and all things Nichiren, too**), **we do not accept input from the ""corporate interests"" we are reporting on, as those will simply try to use our site to advertise and promote themselves**.  No one here gets paid or otherwise compensated for their participation.  We are fiercely independent and will remain so by carefully guarding our site from those who would seek to use it for their own self-promotion or to promote the beliefs/practices we all left/escaped from/outgrew/figured out were false already/found *harmful*.  This is *NOT* a potential market or population for you to spread your beliefs into - we're over it.  It is *extremely* likely that the people here have far more experience with and knowledge about SGI/Nichiren than you do.

Consider yourself on probation - your next post may well be your last.  Your commentary is not acceptable to our forum and we will not host it as that might be regarded as endorsement of despicable views such as you have stated so eloquently right here.

As for the rest, blah blah blah.  Just more stupid superstitious nonsense.  We don't CARE about Tasekiji doctrine; it's rubbish.  Magical thinkingy, intolerant garbage.  And I've been quite clear thus far that this is my view of it.

The US does not have terrorism and nuclear problems nor holds any enmity towards Africa. Africa is not a threat to the USA currently, given that China has also started a market there. 

I made this analogy to merely demonstrate why the US' ability or inability in doing something shouldn't be based on ""they would have done that a thousand times.""

&gt;Far East forces are closer and as tensions rise in that region, it won't be safe to leave them alone with China. 

Far East forces aren't closer, they're actually farther because to reach Persian Gulf, they'd need to get around Malaysia and pass through Malacca Strait. Assuming they start somewhere between Philippines and Japan, that'd be a 12,000km journey. However, if US decides to transport its units from Europe, assuming they start somewhere south of France, through the Suez Canal and Bab-el-Mandeb and around Arabian Peninsula (not landing in KSA at all, solely going by the sea routes,) it'd only be around 8,000km (I'm using Google Earth for distances, you could try it yourself.)

Also, the forces in Far East are there to contain China, they're there to provide security for US allies in the region. Again, we can't say for certain whether China even gets involved or not.

&gt;The US doesn't have that many troops. They can't evacuate everywhere to focus on Iran. They will at best be forced to draw manpower from regional allies such as the KSA or Israel. 

They don't need to evacuate ""everywhere."" European NATO members have a military to defend themselves in times of high tensions, so drawing forces from there wouldn't be as catastrophic as one might think. Further, what's stopping US from enlisting the aid of its regional allies? They'd be more than happy to help.

&gt;Qatar will not be able to side with Iran and go against the US. That would heavily affect the outcome of the war. 

Well, Qatar isn't a significant factor. They'd most likely remain neutral, though they may join the US side.

&gt;No one starts a war hoping to lose. Iraq also invaded Iran, certain that they would win. Basically everyone in the world sided with Iraq, and they failed. This meant Iran, at least for the moment, was invincible. 

This isn't a place to discuss Iran-Iraq War history. Suffice to say, everyone is an exaggeration, and we did have weapons to counter Iraqis', we didn't fight with pitchforks.

&gt;Also, I've been wondering, where would the US station their troops? On KSA soil? UAE? Qatar? Jordan? Persian Gulf? Some of them may get seasick!

L'origine du drapeau Canadien, c'est le fait que les francophones détestaient l'Union Jack sur le Red Enseign.

À l'époque, ça a causé une grande polémique. Les libéraux sous Lester B Pearson voulaient un nouveau drapeau réconcilateur, sans Union Jack. Les conservateurs, sous Diefenbaker, voulaient absolument garder le lien avec le Royaume-Uni, et garder le Union Jack. Pearson, et les Libéraux, voulaient absolument aucune association coloniale dans le nouveau drapeau. Assez célèbrement, c'est lorsque les députés Québecois conservateurs ont brisé la ligne de parti et se sont rangé du côté du nouveau drapeau qu'il a été adopté.

Tu as raison qu'il y a toujours eu plusieurs racistes (l'Ontario et le Manitoba se sont inventés des Red Enseigns comme drapeaux provinciaux en réaction au nouveau drapeau), mais on a toujours été capable de travailler avec des gens ouvert d'esprit. Même lors de la premiere révolte des patriotes, le drapeau vert-blanc-rouge représente les irlandais, les français, et les anglais, et plusieurs membres des patriotes étaient anglophones. 

Dans le cas de l'hymne, souviens-toi que c'était ""God save the King"" jusqu'à assez récemment. Dans le documentaire ""Acadie, Acadie"" qui décrit le mouvement étudiant pour tenter d'obtenir le statut officiel bilingue à Moncton en 1967, il y a une scène assez frappente où le God Save the Queen est chanté, les anglais se lèvent et les francophones restent assis, puis lorsqu'on passe à Ô Canada, les anglais s'assisent et les francophones se lèvent pour chanter. 

Le Ô Canada, c'était notre hymne national à nous. Les anglais auraient pu aussi bien choisir Maple Leaf Forever - autant populaire sinon plus que le Ô Canada au Canada anglais, mais on a tout de même choisi le Ô Canada, étant plus rassembleur. Maple Leaf Forever aurait été tout aussi bien un symbole national Canadien rassembleur pour les anglais - il n'a pas été choisi car il ne rassemblait pas les francophones.

C'est lorsqu'on est tellement intransigeants qu'on est incapable de travailler avec personne, qu'on donne raison aux racistes. Un peu comme comment Wilfrid Laurier s'est fait détruire par une coalition de Nationalistes au Québec et d'anti-Nationalistes dans l'Ouest. 

&gt;Je ne crois pas que le Canada soit vraiment intéressé à « concilier » sa minorité francophone ; en fait, il me semble aujourd'hui qu'une bonne partie des Canadiens (surtout dans l'ouest) sont à peine conscients qu'il existe effectivement des francophones au Canada.

### Handful of reason why trump is good. Do I need to mention low unemployment rates and a growing economy?

### 

### He says he wants to “Make America Great Again.”

What's wrong with your president wanting to make your country great?

### He’s a businessman and not a politician.

Where other politicians receive giant donations from tech firms, Trump does not.

### He hates the media.

He's fighting the corner of the people, too long has the media had control over what information we see. Now people are waking up to the propaganda.  

### He’s nationalist rather than globalist.

Being a nationalist he has the interest of America before any other country. That's the type of person we need in power. Not some sellout like those in the EU.

### He is pro-gun.

Proving he's a man who respects our countries constitution, a constitution designed to maximize freedoms for all. 

### He does not think Russia is a threat.

People are becoming more aware that Russia is not the cold war era soviet bogey man anymore. There is a reason the Russian people love Putin.

### He's brave enough to speak his mind.

People need to be called out on their bull shit especially when it regards high level politics. It's refreshing to see Trump grill some incompetent hack.

### He’s not “politically correct.”

Political correctness is simply control over what can be said. Trump is showing he values facts overs feelings. You're offending by what Trump says? Who cares, facts don't care about your feelings.

### He says he’s not a racist.

People have a hard time proving he is a racist. Trump denies it, until it can be proven otherwise, we can conclude that Trump is not a racist.

### He’s against open borders.

Gotta pay your tax if you want our services.

Now the country name 'France' does in fact derive from ""Francia"" or ""Empire of the Franks"" (hence 'Frankrijk', 'Frankreich' etc.) as Francia was the name of that empire mentioned before from 481 to 843

I'm giving up on reading wikipedia now but I get the feeling that, and this part I'm 90% entirely making up, the reason why Franks became a general term was because Francia was the largest Germanic/'barbaric' conquering of / empire in previously Roman land, and that 'Franks' became a sort of term inside the remaining Roman empire to mean anyone 'not Roman' inside Europe, and that maybe this carried over to Byzantine empire, which was subsequently where the phrase 'Lingua Franca' originated to refer to that pidgin italian language spoken in the Mediterranean trade that they took part in

actually that makes no sense because apparently they spoke Medieval Greek by that time in the byzantine empire, not the 'late latin' that they spoke early on. whereas the term 'lingua franca' is clearly latin??

You could always buy the game, test out the performance on the testing range and refund if it's unplayable before your 2 hours is up. Just bear in mind that the testing range map is probably best case performance. In larger maps your FPS might be halved.

With a 2600k and a 1080Ti I get anywere between 90 fps to 30 fps depending on what's happening. It's not a well oiled machine but compared to ARMA 3 it's buttery smooth for me.

In terms of gameplay if you're looking for communication with random players in ARMA 3 playing modes like KOTH you're gonna have a bad time. Voice comms in squad are more on the level of mid level CS:GO competitive or maybe Rainbow Six Siege. If you've got a bunch of good players that speak the same language (might not be as common on EU servers) there is going to be a lot of communication. In my experience it's fun to play with randoms but if you expect high level play you will want to find a few friends in game that you know perform consistently.

Squad does have modding but since the game is in alpha they are making changes to how the mods integrate with the game and right now we're waiting on the new modding framework to be finalised. From what I've seen mods tend towards new maps, modified versions of existing objective layouts, slightly modified mechanics around ticket bleed and new factions.

Personally I have grown to hate modding in ARMA because every mission maker and unit I've been with is constantly changing the mods they require for seemingly little gain.

Instead when asked ""What does it mean to be Jewish?"", the number one reason given (73%) was ""Remembering the Holocaust"".

Some people think it's a secular pseudo-religion called Holocaust-ianity (combining the words ""holocaust"" and ""Christianity"")

https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Holocaustianity

Laws in many U.S. states, known as [""holocaust education"" laws](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/05/holocaust-deniers-shut-down-at-oregon-legislative-hearing.html), mandate the teaching of this secular pseudo-religion to all school children.

This indoctrinates kids with the belief that the Jewish people are ""unique"" in their historical victim-hood.

This puts Jews at the **very top of the victim-hood hierarchy**.

 And since a widely believed victim-hood narrative gives you political power, being at the top of the victim-hood hierarchy give you the most political power.

That's why holocaust-ianity causes people to believe that Jews deserve special rights that no one else has.

For example, holocaust-ianity means that Israel has an ethical exemption to create the same type of racists country that Nazi Germany created.

Also holocaust-ianity give jews the right to violate the principle of free speech, so that ""holocaust deniers"" can be censored and even put in jail.

 Currently no other groups has this special political right to protect their victim-hood narrative against people who might use their free speech rights to question the narrative.

The political power engendered by Holocaust-ianity is so powerful that it must be protected from the blasphemers, otherwise known as holocaust ""deniers""

""Holocaust denial"" is in truth, a form of blasphemy against the pseudo-religion of Holocaust-ianity. 

It's really Holocaust Atheism. And it must be prevented from spreading at all cost.

Creating false Jewish victimhood myths is nothing new.

 Remember the Spanish Inquisition? 

History books are filled with claims of tens of thousands of Jews being tortured &amp; murdered by evil white Christians during the Spanish Inquisition.

 In reality the [Spanish Inquisition was 99% Myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhlAqklH0do&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Another **false genocide story** used to demonize Europeans is contained in a book called ""King Leopold's Ghost"".

It claims that King Leopold II is responsible for genociding 10 million people during his rule of the Congo. 

The book is a lie written by a Jewish author.

He increased his meat and bun orders.

He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade
He finally got his son home from college to help
him out.

But then something happened.
His son said, ""Father, haven't you been listening
to the radio?
Haven't you been reading the newspapers?
There's a big depression.
The European situation is terrible.
The domestic situation is worse.""
Whereupon the father thought, ""Well, my son's
been to college, he reads the papers and he
listens to the radio, and he ought to know.""
So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders.
took down his advertising signs, and no longer
bothered to stand out on the highway to sell
his hot dogs.
And his hot dog sales fell almost overnight.
You're right, son,"" the father said to the boy.
We certainly are in the middle of a great depression.""

If the Ottomans haven't done so yet, you now want to beat them to the Turkish Beyliks. Your mission tree gives you claims on Karaman, Dulkadir, and Ramazan. Take whatever the Ottos haven't ASAP. If you can, keep expanding towards the Black Sea to wall the Ottos off from Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus. Especially, you need to prevent the Ottos from eating into Persia. If they can expand freely into Europe and Persia, they'll become way too strong. 

After letting AE cool off, I consolidated the Arabian peninsula and started expanding down towards Ethiopia. Don't get too wrapped up in these wars, as the development in these areas is poor and won't make you very powerful.

Next part is how I got lucky. Timurids got shattered, and became so small they accepted a vassalization request. If this doesn't work with Timurids, you can always try to snag Fars, Ajam, whatever country has lots of cores but almost doesn't exist anymore.  I was then able to feed my Timurid vassal the entirety of Persia and integrate them. From this point on I was #1 world power by far. Trade from Persia to Alexandria is insane (70+ ducats in value), and only gets bigger if you expand into Lahore, Sindh, and the trade company regions.

I'll do my best to explain! (I was about to type your ear off but figured I should answer the question as succinctly as I can lol. If you want to know more I can answer more!)

In music, there are certain notes that sound nice, or consonant, when played together. Other notes sound grating or dissonant when played at the same time. The reason for this goes down to the mathematics of sound waves, which I'll skip over. In particular, the octave (12 half-steps or frets apart), the perfect 5th (7 half-steps), and the perfect 4th (5 half-steps) are super consonant. That's part of why they're referred to as ""perfect"" intervals instead of major or minor.

At some point, people got tired of singing in perfect 5ths and wanted even more notes at the same time. Enter the 3rd! The 3rd is right in between the base note (the root) and the 5th, and still sounds nice. You can have the major 3rd (4 half-steps apart), or the minor 3rd (3 half-steps). Therefore, if you play a note, a major 3rd above that, and the 5th above the root at the same time, you get a major chord. If you play the a root, minor 3rd, and a 5th, you get a minor chord. That's where all you major and minor chords come in. You can spice them up if you like, but that's the basics.

 So now you have one chord. Hearing the same thing over and over again gets kinda boring, so what if you used different chords too? Melodies are were written using a major (or minor) scale. It just so happens if you only use the 8 notes in a major or minor scale, you can form a bunch of these major or minor chords. Over time, a tradition developed of what chords to play in a row, and now you've got chord progressions. Slap that below a melody, and you get underlying movement, structure, and a richer sound.

That's about as short as I can make it while hopefully explaining what you need to know! Chord progressions are a musical tradition passed down western Europe. There are tons of other musical traditions (and modern techniques) that don't follow this system at all, so I think it's important to know that too.",True,False,False,,0,1562086856,,False,0,{},esljows,False,t3_c8b1bb,False,False,t3_c8b1bb,/r/Guitar/comments/c8b1bb/stupid_question_why_does_composition_start_with/esljows/,False,,1571269435,4,True,[],False,Guitar,t5_2qi79,r/Guitar,public,0,

Its lmost like a higher standard is expected from us and culturally we are made to bow to all others. If i said our culture is in danger of erasure from excessive mixing i would be seen as a white supremacist. (When I say ""our culture"" i pretty much just mean elightenment values) However if a country like Japan restricts immigration (for many reasons, not only cultural preservation) it is seen as okay and within their right and noone gives them shit. This is reflected in current border policy discussion, a hit topic in the US and W. Europe. For the west to constrict our borders is seen as morally low or uninclusive. But the borders of most countries are quite strict to mass immigration. 

Now why is that? I know this is off topic but its something that im really curious about.

I think its because of our massive human progress and economic success. Its like there is a feeling everyone in the world deserves a slice of that successful pie. We've got something good going and exclusion is seen as ""mean"".  Thats pretty low resolution but i think its where these issues stem from.

The best solution is an ""american dream"" but for the world. Something along the lines of this identity you were talking about. Sadly thats a little ways off. I think we first need worldwide cooperation and coordination while keeping policy and governance controlled at the local level.

Fortunately for Labour, recent poling suggests that a fair proportion of Labour Leave voters don't count Brexit as their top issue.  They may have voted leave, but aren't Brexit-at-all-cost types.  

This is sharp contrast to Labour Remain voters, most of whom *do* count Brexit as their top issue, and would be far more likely to abandon the party unless it (at the very least) adopts a ""Referendum with the option of Remain"" platform.

Pra mim, a não existência (que não recomendo que ocorra de forma violenta ou por ação de terceiros) é algo do meu interesse, que também pode ser de interesse público, mas que não necessariamente é.

Pra mim, a lava-jato é uma referência no combate ao crime organizado e deve receber apoio popular quando realiza esse papel.

Pra mim, se existe um, dois, três, x indivíduos corruptos na lava-jato, de forma que a sua intenção original seja deturpada, os mesmos devem ser acionados judicialmente e afastados da operação.

Pra mim, pouco interessa esse negócio da vaza-jato. Não porque eu tenho um dogma com a operção, pois não tenho, mas porque isso não se sobrepõe ao objetivo maior, que possui fins republicanos (combate ao crime organizado), e esse deve ser sempre o foco de qualquer conversa que inclua a mesma.

Pra mim, o sistema judicial é porco em qualquer lugar do mundo, sempre vai ter uma vítima e uma parte beneficiada. Não existe processo legal 100% justo, qualquer advogado entra pra ganhar a causa e fazem o diabo a 4 pra conseguir isso.

Pra mim, lugar do Lula é na cadeia. Isso pode não se relacionar com a ação pelo qual ele foi considerado culpado. Pra mim, ele é pros brasileiros o que Marx foi pras vítimas dos Gulags e dos campos de concentração chineses. Isso não é um julgamento legal, é um julgamento pessoal.

Pra mim, pouco importa se Lula deveria, legalmente falando, estar preso ou não. Importa que está preso. Poderia ser eu, poderia ser você, alguém que conhecemos. Isso acontece na justiça.

Het is in principe niet anders dan hier in Nederland. Lijsttrekkers hoeven geen premier te worden/het kabinet in. Wat telt is het vertrouwen van het Parlement. (in dit geval het Europese) en regeringsleiders zijn in essentie de 'formateurs'.  


&gt;Timmermans heeft in Europa een sterker democratisch mandaat dan Borrell Fontelles, die nu nog Spaanse minister van Buitenlandse Zaken is. Beide worden met dit plan vice-voorzitter van de Europese Commissie, waarbij de functie van Hoge Vertegenwoordiger die Borrel Fontelles mogelijk krijgt als belangrijker wordt gezien. Dat zit dus behoorlijk scheef.

A Jewish immigration advocacy group:

&gt; Melanie Nezer, senior vice president of public affairs at HIAS, said in a statement that “Stories of Holocaust survivors are reminders that we should welcome the stranger and protect the refugee.

&gt; “Making the US great means upholding our commitment to international law and asylum seekers,” she continued.

&gt; “Blocking people from applying at ports of entry and forcing asylum seekers at our southern border to remain in Mexico to await their hearing is illegal, dangerous and unprecedented in American history. The greatness of America is in our diversity. America is great when it can be a safe haven from war, violence, persecution and disaster. America has a moral duty to be that safe haven,” she said.

And Max Glauben:

&gt; ""I had flashbacks,"" said the 90-year-old man about turning on his television and seeing stories about migrant children being snatched from their parents and imprisoned in cages inside warehouses and box stores along the border. He, too, was separated from his parents — first his mother and little brother, both sent to a place called Majdanek, then his father, taken by boxcar to a slave labor camp.

&gt; The 90-year-old man, Holocaust survivor Max Glauben, would never again see his family. They died in the camps — his mother and brother gassed, his father shot. This is what Max Glauben thinks about when he turns on the television and sees stories about children separated from their parent — about being left an orphan.

&gt; ""If you go through horror, even 70 years later, you get flashbacks,"" he said Monday from his North Dallas home.

And Yoka Verdoner:

&gt; The events occurring now on our border with Mexico, where children are being removed from the arms of their mothers and fathers and sent to foster families or “shelters”, make me weep and gnash my teeth with sadness and rage. I know what they are going through. When we were children, my two siblings and I were also taken from our parents. And the problems we’ve experienced since then portend the terrible things that many of these children are bound to suffer.

&gt; My family was Jewish, living in 1942 in the Netherlands when the country was occupied by the Nazis. We children were sent into hiding, with foster families who risked arrest and death by taking us in. They protected us, they loved us, and we were extremely lucky to have survived the war and been well cared for.

And Stephen Jacobs:

&gt; Stephen B. Jacobs has a warning from the past for America today: It's happening again.

&gt; At 79 years old he is among the youngest of the living Holocaust survivors and was born six years after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. But Jacobs can remember life in the Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald; what the Nazis did to him, his family, his friends.

&gt; He worries about what's happening right now in America, where he has lived and prospered since arriving a couple of years after Buchenwald's liberation on April 11, 1945.

And Irene Butter:

&gt; Irene Butter grew up as a Jewish child in Nazi-occupied Europe and survived two concentration camps.

&gt; ""And it is unbelievable to me that, in this day and age, and in this country, that children are kidnapped from their parents, held in detention centers, and not knowing whether they will ever see their parents again,"" the longtime peace activist and Holocaust survivor told a large crowd at the Families Belong Together rally in Ann Arbor.

As well as Leon Malmed and Rachel Epstein:

&gt; Leon Malmed’s childhood fear came flooding back when he read about President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy in the newspapers.

&gt; He still remembers the day his parents were taken from him.

&gt; “That is the only memory that I have from my childhood,” Malmed, now 80, said as he sat on his living room couch at his South Lake Tahoe home. “I remember hanging on to the dress of my mother and crying.

&gt; “That image just stayed all my life, and that was 76 years ago.”

&gt; Malmed and his sister, Rachel Epstein, are both survivors of the Holocaust. They lost their parents, Srul and Chana Malmed, nearly two years after the start of World War II.

&gt; Eva Schloss, 86, is an Auschwitz survivor and the stepsister of Anne Frank. Both Frank and Schloss were Jewish refugees in Amsterdam together and the pair played together as children until their families were forced into hiding in 1942.

Second, because the discussion is on minorities in the United States. Which would include everyone who is not of white-European descent.

In Mexico, white Europeans are a minority. Each country has their own minorities. The topic is not a global discussion, but rather minorities and homophobes in the US.

But to my surprise my dad said I don’t have to have kids anytime soon till I want to(I don’t plan to if I do till I’m 30) and my cousin(who has the only 5 year old that I can stand) said I can or don’t have to have kids if I don’t want to and that it’s great that there’s so many things I want to do. I told my grandmother that I might not even want kids and she said my dad changed his mind. 
But he said he wants someone to cuddle with and watch movies(and is now okay with adoption) and it made me think about my childhood. He fed me, but I think it was till I was able to use the microwave(I’ve been able to use the stove since I was 8) he worked, but so did my mom and she did most of the cooking and cleaning.

Well it is much easier to communicate with foreigners/people in English.

Work and life must go on and spending whole conversations explaining basic words is both pointless and counterproductive if you don't need to.

Also Dutch is sort of a slowly dying language. In the major cities we are seeing a language shift towards English. Give it another century or two and Dutch will be as extinct in Amsterdam as it is in Brussels. Take me for instance. There are days, sometimes a whole week when I don't speak Dutch at all. Sure I read the news in Dutch but that's about it. And if that were in English I'd probably prefer that (English is a much simpler and more compact language so you can read it faster). Basically I only speak Dutch with my parents and a couple friends from high school. I live in a Randstad liberal city bubble of course but the country as a whole is moving in the same direction.

My grandfather was one of the survivors of that raid and it certainly wasn't a rare case. 

Although OP's story is one of those rare cases where success (saving lives) was certainly accomplished, if people actually read up what resistance fighters in Europe did, people would not be so eager to praise or glorify them. Many had selfish motivations, would steal from weaker people with force, fought each other over dominance, sabotaged supplies that would simply be cut from the portion that the people got, etc. 

It was so bad at some point that Churchill refused to drop more weapons into France because he knew it'd actually save lives if he didn't. Different resistance groups would be waiting at drop zones for other groups to get the weapons, so they could swoop in and steal theirs, or raid them at their hideouts. The resistance would occasionally destroy/bomb something, but without a follow through of an army, the Germans would simply repair whatever was damaged, practically over the weekend, while lining up and executing a few dozen men in the nearest town to send a message. The resistance really had no practical use. People hated them. Nothing brave about sacrificing other people's lives so you can be a wannabee warrior. 

It took the British OSS to eventually organize the resistance and shape it into something useful. Even then it was deemed they'd only be useful for a single day, and then got disbanded. On the eve of D-Day they sabotaged the railways which delayed reinforcements to the German front from days to weeks. After that any resistance they could find was purposefully disbanded as they didn't want uniformless men fighting in a war between 2 armies.",True,False,False,,0,1562100613,,1562100836,0,{},esm91bb,False,t3_c8cazy,False,True,t1_esm4tb6,/r/todayilearned/comments/c8cazy/til_76_years_ago_yesterday_dutch_partisan_willem/esm91bb/,False,,1571281477,0,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,r/todayilearned,public,0,

No, that isn't really correct. The United States, South Vietnam and allies never committed *ground troops* to invade and occupy the north. Much of the ground fighting took place in South Vietnam, with a few exceptions. For instance, there were some Special Forces missions that went into Cambodia and Laos to observe the Ho Chi Minh trail. There was also [operation Ivory Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivory_Coast) which was an unsuccessful special forces raid intended to rescue POWs held in North Vietnam. 

Also, in 1970 there was a ""secret"" invasion of Cambodia where US ground forces crossed the Cambodia-South Vietnam border to secure the southern end of the Ho Chi Minh trail and make North Vietnamese infiltration harder.

But, we cannot forget the air campaign. The United States Air Force repeatedly conducted aerial bombing campaigns in North Vietnam, including operation Rolling Thunder from 1965-68 and Operations Linebacker I and II in March and December 1972. Also, US air power put mines in Haiphong harbor in May 1972 to interrupt the flow of communist shipping bringing war materiel to North Vietnam.

These bombing campaigns were directed at transport hubs, harbors, industrial facilities, as well as along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos and Cambodia. The intent of these bombings was to weaken North Vietnamese ability to conduct warfare, and to ""inflict pain"" to influence the leadership of North Vietnam to seek a negotiated settlement ending the war that would ensure South Vietnam's independence and territorial integrity.

----

As to the underlying question of ""why didn't the US, South Vietnam and allies try to invade and occupy North Vietnam with ground forces?""

There are a handful of inter-related reasons that all dissuaded US policy makers from taking that course of action.

First is the issue of escalation. Burns and Novick do a good job in the miniseries of explaining the Johnson and Nixon administrations concern about escalation, and whether US actions like aerial bombing of the North, mining harbors, invading Cambodia; would in-turn cause the Soviets and the Chinese to increase their support for North Vietnam.

You mentioned the experience of the Korean War, and a risk of repeating Chinese intervention. That likely did have an impact on US strategic thinking. 

But, we should not forget the precedent of the Cuban Missile Crisis either. In October of 1962, the US threatened to invade communist Cuba to remove the threat of Soviet ballistic missiles on the island. (The failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 lent credibility to the idea that the US would be willing to invade Cuba to topple the Castro regime). In response to threat of US invasion, and the risk of US seizing the soviet missiles on the island as well as cargo ships transporting missiles, the Soviets threatened retaliation. This standoff very nearly started a nuclear war.

So, shifting our attention back to Vietnam. In 1965 when US ground forces arrive in South Vietnam in large numbers, it's only a few years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Soviets had shown that they were willing to take risks (putting missiles in cuba) and to escalate tensions to defend communist-aligned states. Would the new Brezhnev regime in Moscow behave differently in 1965 than Khrushchev had in 1962? Or would an invasion of the North provoke brinksmanship again? 

A second factor is the domestic factor. The US government made the case to the US public (and to nations around te world) that American soldiers were fighting for the defense and freedom of South Vietnamese. And American soldiers were fighting and dying to prevent the *spread* of communism in Southeast Asia. 

An invasion would be fundamentally in tension with the ""defensive war"" argument. At the outset of the invasion, the US would *need* to declare what their aims were. Were they trying to force the Northern govt to the negotiating table? Were they trying to force a change of regime in the north? Were they going to re-unify Vietnam under the authority of the government in Saigon? 

Would American mothers and fathers, wives, sons and daughters accept troop deaths during an invasion of the North? Did the American public know or care *that much* about South Vietnam's independence?
No matter what the US declared the invasion goals to be, there is the risk that Soviets and Chinese would read the situation as US attempting to ""roll back communism"", which could be expected to provoke an escalatory response. Additionally, aggressive warfare is banned by the UN convention, and so non-aligned countries around the world could be expected to take a dim view of a US invasion of North Vietnam. 

Finally, to invade the North would require troops. To occupy the North while still keeping soldiers to guard the South against VC and NVA guerrilla warfare might require several hundred thousand more soldiers in-country. Rather than 550,000 US troops in the south, maybe it would require 1,000,000 troops in the South and North. Maybe more?

A million soldiers deployed to fight in Southeast Asia, in the context of the broader Cold War tensions means a lot of troops tied-down who can't respond to a potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe. 

And it is tax money spent in warfare that is not being spent on Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon's domestic policy agenda. It's money not spent on alleviating poverty, on medicare, or not spent on infrastructure or education. Or else it is raising taxes sharply to be able to fund everything.

So, US policy-makers took all these factors into account, and decided that it *was* important for US credibility to defend South Vietnamese independence, but that an invasion of the North was not in US interests, and posed significant risks.",True,False,False,,0,1562100860,,False,0,{},esm9h9k,False,t3_c8aixh,False,True,t3_c8aixh,/r/AskHistorians/comments/c8aixh/did_we_only_fight_in_south_vietnam_why/esm9h9k/,False,,1571281675,1,True,[],False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

Algunos se negaron a tomar asiento mientras un cuarteto de jazz interpretaba el himno de la Unión Europea, el “Himno a la alegría” de Beethoven, mientras que otros, especialmente los legisladores del Partido Brexit británico, dieron la espalda al proceso.
Además, hubo otra protesta contra la decisión de impedir que el líder separatista catalán Carles Puigdemont tome su escaño, y en defensa de la capitana de un barco alemán que está detenida en Italia debido a un enfrentamiento con las autoridades del país por los derechos de los migrantes.
Tras los incidentes del acto institucional, la cámara recuperó pronto su actividad normal de la legislatura de 28 países, que representa a aproximadamente 500 millones de personas y es uno de los ejercicios de democracia más grandes del mundo.
Las interrupciones enfatizaron las divisiones entre los legisladores justamente cuando los líderes de la Unión Europea se enfrentaban en Bruselas sobre quién tomará los principales puestos de la unión.
Las elecciones de mayo tuvieron la mayor participación en décadas y fijaron el escenario para un parlamento más fracturado, con más poder para la extrema derecha y los partidos ambientalistas.

Los legisladores británicos ni siquiera deberían de formar parte del Parlamento Europeo.

La división del Brexit abrió la sesión del martes. Mientras los legisladores del Partido Brexit dieron la espalda en señal de protesta, aquellos a favor de la UE usaron camisetas amarillas que decían “Stop Brexit”.

When Nihilanth and the alien controllers died, the Vortigaunts became allies with humans (you can notice even in HL1 that the Vortigaunts don't attack you in the factory part on Xen because there are no alien controllers around). They have a collective stream of consciousness (the Vortessence) and thus communicate very effectively, which is why they learned human language so quickly. 

The Nihlanth's race were running away from the Combine, a conqueror race that assimilate every race they find. They took advantage of the portal storms created by Black Mesa and conquered Earth in 7 hours, taking over most of the Earth and draining it for resources. The Administrator mentioned in Hl1 was the negotiator for humanity and sold it out to the Combine, becoming their puppet leader on Earth, holding power in the Citadel. City 17 was previously some Eastern European city like any other, but it got renamed to that when the Combine took over. Teleportation storms or circumstances led to it becoming an important center for humanity.

No one knows what the Combine actually look like. They take races they enslaved and merge them with technology to make soldiers, and none of the enemies you see are *native* Combine, but they most powerful are the Advisors, or the Shu'ulathoi, who seem to be the primary target of the Combine as they were super intelligent shared conscious beings who could shape matter with thought and spread energy or whatever.

I think part of the difficulty is that in my circles (Bernie type people, liberal Arabs, rarely conservative Arabs but they aren't worth talking politics to anyway), if I say I support zionists, they think I support the settlers and the extremists. However, from now on when I hear someone say they are a zionist, I will not assume the worst and instead will keep what you are saying in mind.

My father had a hard life. He suffered a lot in the 1982 Lebanese invasion. So I know why he is bitter. But he would always say that he is not anti-semitic. His best friend was actually an American Jewish man -- they never talked politics though.

My dad would say that Israel just should not exist and that the Israelis should ""go home"" to Europe. I'm sure you're familiar with this idea. But for years I have been thinking that if Arabs were to overtake Israel, it would turn into a genocide and millions of innocent Jewish people would die. And if Israelis went to Europe, they would be persecuted like you just said. He was advocating for genocide, right? I truly do not believe my father hates Jewish people in the Nazi sense. He is an educated person and has many Jewish friends. But unfortunately there are many Americans who do not think they are racist, and perhaps they are not racist in the sense that they want to lynch black people, but they fail to take the time to peer into the perspective of black people enough to avoid saying the most ignorant stuff. I think my dad fell into that category. I still think it is understandable given the hell he lived through as a young man, though I wish he had been stronger and thought more deeply. 

I don't know what the solution is, but I do think that Jewish people ought to have a country and a land. Because of my upbringing I also know the suffering of Palestinians and Arabs in the region too well and in too much detail to not sympathize with them (""us""), but I also know that religious extremism runs rampant in the Arab world. It isn't easy for Israel to deal with that. Hamas is an authoritarian scourge on the earth, for example. While I have met many Israelis who say they would shake hands/have coffee/welcome an Arab, most Palestinians will say the opposite.

It is even illegal for me to be talking to you right now back in my home country. I am not allowed to speak to any Israeli anywhere, ever. The brainwashing is at an extreme for many Arab children. The brainwashing isn't just about Israel, it is about all sorts of things --- gay people, women's rights, sex outside marriage, religion, etc. It's a problem that Israel didn't create, but it does negatively impact you. Objectively, Israeli forces have done great damage to my family, but I also know that my family members love to blame every Arab problem on only Israel which is incorrect.

The topic is much larger than me and I wish I was smart enough to unwind all of it, but I appreciate you taking the time to help me understand the terminology more so I can speak a little less ignorantly.

[],,ChromeLynx,1336328827.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_7ngor,False,[],"The problem with the amazon comparison is not necessarily the difference in how fraudulent the resellers are. The problem is that Amazon, and many other similar services, police their third-party resellers and what they sell. I can attest from indirect experience that bol.com, the Dutch &amp; Belgian alternative for Amazon (apparently the Dutch-speaking market is too small for Amazon, so we get a local alternative), takes fraudulent sellers very seriously. If you use bol.com to sell stolen goods, you're going to be banned the moment the store is onto you and you'll probably have to explain yourself to the police the next morning.

G2A does none of that. At best, it turns a blind eye, and may say that it's impossible to police against it. At worst, it profits off the fact that some sellers are fraudsters and some customers might know that but still want to buy at below market rate.

The sad thing is though, that the initial acquisition of the key is, on the surface, legit. You can check whether an item is stolen by calling the police to see if there have been reports as to where that item came from. That's probably very difficult with game keys without (probably) claiming the key, checking its transaction origin, checking the credit card number and calling the credit card owner as to whether they bought the item. Doing that for EVERY. GAME. PURCHASE. would be impossible for humans to do which you will ABSOLUTELY need to call anyone on a phone, at least in the EU afaik.

To quote Klonan from the Factorio devs:

&gt; In many cases these people use a automated bot to deal with automatically purchasing the game and trying all of details in their credit card database, and then posting these keys to these 3rd party websites. We only saw this fraud happening for us after our Steam release, because the real money is in selling Steam keys - not many people care about website keys. On our side, the cost is very large, each chargeback costs roughly $20 in fines, effectively a negative sale, and we were seeing upwards of 10% chargebacks on our website transactions. Also each chargeback notice had to be handled on a case-by-case basis, at one point I was spending 12 or more hours a week dealing with individual purchases.

&gt; A common saying I hear is that this isn't a problem, because 'The devs just revoke the keys', well that simply isn't true, we don't get notice of a fraudulent payment right away, it can take upwards of 8 weeks for the chargeback to be issued, at which time the key is obviously going to be already sold for profit and forgotten. We still revoke these keys, often to the dismay of the purchaser.

&gt; So an easy solution would be to stop offering Steam keys, the typical effect of some people ruining it for everyone else, but we didn't want to immediately go down that route. First we tried to add additional 'hassle' for these people. We limited transactions to 2 for each credit card, we tightened up the checks our payment provider offered, and we implemented the Steam linking. Each stage of this was only effective for a short period of time, before inevitably the fraudsters adapted to the new circumstances, and our changes were circumvented.

[source](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-171)

In summary, the key sales are initially legit, then some time later the CC owner reports the fraudulent transaction, forcing the dev to have to refund the CC owner and pay a fine to the CC company. G2A at best can't, at worst won't, check the origins of the key and may saddle up a customer with something that may break in the future.

And G2A has been urged to be a responsible seller and offer its Shield for free on any transactions by default which they legally should. I think there was a TotalBiscuit (praise be upon him) video where GearBox prepared a G2A deal and TB urged them to reconsider that deal since G2A was a shady mess, and GearBox went on to set some terms to continue the deal which, had G2A complied with those terms, would have ended the entire debate as to whether or not G2A was a legit business. G2A refused to comment, and GearBox dropped the deal.

G2A just can't be arsed. At this point, I refuse to believe G2A is willing but unable to play by the rules, they won't get my business and I make sure that anyone around me thinking about shopping there is aware of the shit they pull.",True,False,False,,0,1562105300,,False,0,{},esmgw4q,False,t3_c8asot,False,True,t1_esme8gr,/r/JimSterling/comments/c8asot/g2a_is_so_bad_developers_would_rather_you_pirate/esmgw4q/,False,,1571285201,1,True,[],False,JimSterling,t5_2to10,r/JimSterling,public,0,
[],,vmedhe2,1275422652.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_43dp8,False,[],"I disagree this was Churchill more then Japan.Churchill blocked grain shipments from other parts of India, Australia, and US ships for his ill feigned campaign into Greece. Remember this was an acute famine,not a country wide one, it only affected Bengal. Grain shipments in Maharashtra,Bihar, and other parts of India continued to leave India for Europe. India exported more than 70,000 tonnes of rice between January and July 1943.  

Churchill was also considered quiet the racist even by the standards of the time. For him the Hindu population of India was to blame as they were ""breeding like rabbits"". The Viceroy of India , Archibald Wavell, wrote this in his journal following his failed request for food aid.
""Winston sent me a peevish telegram to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet! He has never answered my telegram about food.""

Another example comes from John Colville, his Downing Street secretary. 
""The PM said the Hindus were a foul race “protected by their mere pullulation from the doom that is their due” and he wished Bert Harris[""Bomber"" Harris as he is better known] could send some of his surplus bombers to destroy them.""

Churchill was a product of his time, he did some great things but was also pretty racist and was indeed ,at least partly responsible for the situation in India. He did not particularly care about Indians or India, he cared about the British empire,thus was the limits of his care for those subject to the empire. They were secondary to the empire itself. 

Its hard not to argue Churchill's callous nature towards Indians as he is often quoted as saying “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.” He was also very much against India governing itself, believing the Indian people to stupid to govern themselves,thus his opposition to the Government of India Act 1935. Indeed the main reason he was ignored during the wilderness years is because he kept comparing Hitler to Ghandi, which made him seem rather insane to his colleges. 

If Churchill had had better relations with India and Indians one could argue the war simply took to much time, or it was a black stain on his record. But all of it coupled together makes one question Churchill and his racist attitudes towards the contribution to the famine.",True,False,False,,1,1562105395,,1562105803,0,{},esmh1cn,False,t3_c89ivk,False,True,t1_eslo5be,/r/EnoughCommieSpam/comments/c89ivk/til_thread_on_pol_pot_people_in_comment_section/esmh1cn/,False,,1571285267,3,True,[],False,EnoughCommieSpam,t5_3fblz,r/EnoughCommieSpam,public,0,

&gt; Notice that in both cases, male obesity rates are 4% higher than than female obesity rates. But if you were to take a ratio like you've done, you'd get an F/M ratio of 0.33 for country A (2/6) and 0.86 for country B (26/30). What a huge difference in ratios, when in fact both reflect the same underlying difference of 4% in male versus female obesity rates.

I'm not sure I agree with this.  To me 2% obese men and 6% obese women isn't a 4% difference, it's a 200% difference because the number of obese women is 200% greater than the number of obese men (if we assume a 50:50 male/female population). Given we were talking about the different in obesity rates between the genders, I don't think the percentage point difference between male and female obesity rates is as illuminating as the ratio between those two.

The original point brought up was that a small number of European countries are the only ones to have higher rates of male obesity than female, and I was broadening this point to look at the overall ratio.  If country A has 25% obese men and 29% obese women, and country B has 3% obese men and 6% obese women, I think the fact that A has a 4 percentage point difference and B has a 3 percentage point difference is what would mislead you into thinking A has more inequality. In fact country B has two obese women to every one obese man (again, assuming 50:50 gender which is a bit cheeky but not that unrealistic) and country A has about 8 obese women to every 7 obese men.

I was careful to describe it as a ratio, not a percentage, to avoid making it look like it was to do with percentages of the total population, and because I personally hate it when people describe a percentage point difference as a percentage difference (because obesity going from 3% of population to 6% of population isn't a 3% increase, it's a 3PP increase which is actually a 100% increase).  As I say, I'm not a statistician though and I'm not aware of the problems of double normalisation or of describing the difference between two different subgroups of a population as a ratio rather than a percentage point difference.",True,False,False,,0,1562106227,,False,0,{},esmiapk,False,t3_c7n83n,False,True,t1_esl82a2,/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/c7n83n/oc_of_obese_people_meny_axis_vs_womenx_axis_per/esmiapk/,False,,1571285866,1,True,[],False,dataisbeautiful,t5_2tk95,r/dataisbeautiful,public,0,

That is what we have right now. Though I see the peak of that close, maybe even already passed. 

&gt;India doesn't have much power and has massive issues of its own.  
&gt;  
&gt;As  for China it will face massive problems such as transforming its  economy away from low end manufacturing goods and maintaining internal  stability with it's authoritarian regime. Plus it's heading towards a  collision with the US potentially challenging the US hegemony. It's not  going to win this trade war with the US.

ALL the asian nations are making huge leaps forward. Though I actually agree that China will see some huge issues of it's own, it will make a dent in it's development, but won't stop it. 1,2 billion inhabitants (last time I echked, proabably more now) simply dwarves Europe, even combined with the US. And though I do see a technological advantage for a couple more decades, eventually parity will be reached. And then it simply comes down to numbers and maths. 

&gt; The previous issue's you've highlighted doesn't necessitate to a federal  europe. It would benefit europe to have some level of co-operation but  there's no need for a United States of Europe. 

Yes, it does. Europe reacts too slow at the moment. It's monetary and economic policies need to be urgently streamlined. Descision making needs to be streamlined. More democratic accountability has to be implemented. There is a lot to do in this regard. 

Everybody doing his own thing is the ideal setting for devide and conquer by more unified powers. This WILL happen. There was no period in history where it was not the case that nations tried to use the divisions in other countries for their own gain. In fact it is happening right now, with both Russia and China and lately also the US trying to play these games in Europe. The whole world set up is changing right now, in front of our eyes. If we do not adapt, we will become dinosaurs and eventually be taken advantage of. Not adapting to new situations is what brought down every empire and nation in history, sooner or later. 

 

&gt;And what is the momentum of history ? It  does not necessitate a Federal Europe. The momentum is what the European  people make it and currently there is not an appetite for Federal  Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;We could argue forever about future predictions. It's been fun and will be interesting to see how the world turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a huge appetite for more Europe. You confuse the most vocal people with the actual majority. You also saw that at the last european elections. Going by the news and media everybody expected a huge right wing push. That did not happen but for very few countries, and even that was balanced out by other countries who overhwlemingly voted for pro european parties, especially because the youth went to the vote this time around. It is exactly that youth that will define the future decades. And as I said, going by the developments of the interenet, where young people from all over Europe, in fact all over the world, are starting to communicate, share their hobbies and interests, the differences between nations will actually diminish.

Heck, even the right wingers are currently working more and more toghether in international politics, the greatest irony of all.

Also I am not trying to blame you for the past and I recognize that your people have also endured many hardships and atrocities. I am not as educated in the historical or present circumstances in Central Europe but I would love to learn more. The lack of education I have received on that matter also goes to demonstrate some of my points; the experiences of entire peoples’ and their countries has been ignored in my country. Of course, it is silly to think that I could be taught in depth about every nation, but my point is that a crafted narrative runs throughout the education system in the US. For example, the area I live in still teaches abstinence only sex ed and does not touch on homosexuality at all. 

Your lack of want for reparations does not mean that they are not necessary. The goal of reparations is not to “introduce even more inequality” or “distort the narrative” as you said, but to bring us closer to equality. There is no level playing field on a hill and until we can fix the land there never will be. Said explicitly: the US is built upon systems of inequality and therefore putting a stop to racism in any one specific area only prevents things from getting worse but does nothing to mend the damage already done. Imagine two buckets, one having received much more water than the second for a very long time. Simply diverting the water itself to flow more equally into both buckets will never cause the second bucket to be equal. Water must be added into the second that is not added to the first in order to catch it up. Or as in a race, to catch up the runner who was held back you must allow him to move forward to where the others are. That seems much more fair to me than simply stopping the cause of the inequality but leaving the disadvantaged, who are still exactly where they were before, to have to attempt to find a way to “pull themselves up” so to speak. It’s okay to lend a helping hand and it’s okay to accept a helping hand. If you want to discuss the merit and effectiveness of specific policies like affirmative action PM me. 

To bring it back to photography (I apologize for politicizing the /r/photography sub lol), I agree that photography and music have been two great equalizers. That said, that only applies to the barrier-to-entry aspect and not to representation which is what started this conversation. It may be (I hope it is) that within your educational system representation is more fair and equal but it is far from it in the US (which I also only assumed is where the OP is because of his use of the term African American, he may not be a US educator). In order to equalize representation black artists have to be taught, and right now very few are. Therefore it is a just cause for OP to be researching specifically for black artists in order to introduce their narratives, and by extension the narratives of black culture and history in this country as a whole, to the educational system.

Nobody isnt some degree of ideological; this very belief that, through it all, we are extolling the virtues of ""Freedom"" is the same flawed neoliberal ideology that has led us through atrocity after atrocity to instill virtues we dont practice on people who don't want us there.

We didn't defeat fascism, the war was a group effort with the majority of the weight falling on the shoulders of the Soviets. Furthermore, we rehabilitated several Nazi officials giving them prominent positions in the post-war Republic as well as Operation Papercliping Nazi scientists (though, of course, the Soviets did as well).

Our opposition to the Soviets was never moral, it was always purely strategic and ideological. We committed just as many atrocities as they did, if not more only thanks to being around longer.

We absolutely devastated the DPRK. Through combat, strategic bombing, and numerous massacres, we and our allies killed roughly 10% of their population and demolished their nation to a near pre-industrial level. If it weren't for Chinese and Soviet relief efforts, its likely they never would have even recovered to the point theyre at now.

Excusing our support for the Rhee regime as a necessity for Cold War strategy is, frankly, disgusting and sets a bad precedent for other dictators supported by the US.

Its incredibly naive to think that the US would pull out our forces if the ROK government requested it. Our continued military presence in the peninsula has been the greatest obstacle to further deescalation to this very day.

The real facts, not 8th grade American history textbook facts, don't line up with your position; every intervention we've engaged in since WW2 has ended in disaster for the people of the world.

We didn't save Europe from Germany.

We didn't defeat Stalin (a brain hemorrhage did).

Our international AIDS relief work is riddled with corruption, poor planing, and plagued with reliance on abstinence only education rather than providing proper medical treatment.

ISIS formed as a direct result of power vacuums caused by the invasion and occupation of Iraq and subsequent ""limited interventions"" in surrounding areas along with financial and material support of various militant groups in the region. Our close allies in the region, Saudi Arabia, are open Wahabists and rather openly offer material support to ISIS and allied militias.

We already went over Korea.

Libya now has open air slave markets. That's an improvement.

Al-Qaeda, the near direct predecessor to ISIS formed as a direct response to the US invasion in Iraq and subsequent politicking in local religious affairs.

Japans a good one, though most notably, our use of nuclear weapons against major population centers to intimidate the Soviets amounts to one of the worst war crimes perpetrated during the war (saying nothing of the firebombing of Tokyo or the brutal post-war occupation).

We have supported numerous genocidal regimes all over the world including Cambodia, Guatemala, Rwanda, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc. That is of course, ignoring the genocides of Native peoples in our own country.

Not all US foreign policy has been evil or bad, but almost all of it has been for our own benefit, consequences be damned. If some people's lives improve, that's great! If Millions of innocents have to die to enrich a few, we have proven time and time again that its a price we are willing to pay.

Now I don't usually effortpost like this but this shit is just silly. If you take one thing away from this, let it be this: You don't lose anything from taking a critical look at America's actions throughout history, but when you defend or rationalize the evils we've committed as necessary or actually good, you make it that much easier to swallow the next atrocity we commit.",True,False,False,,0,1562113017,,False,0,{},esmrrz8,False,t3_c86zto,False,True,t1_esmj3v8,/r/FunnyandSad/comments/c86zto/hercuhercules/esmrrz8/,False,,1571290373,2,True,[],False,FunnyandSad,t5_2z7qd,r/FunnyandSad,public,0,

I am also getting an X570 upgrade soon, but I build in a rather small ITX case (14 liters) and worry a bit about heat.

main usage is going to be for gaming and video editing, and also handling spreadsheets but they're not in the gigabyte size so I'm not sure how much that is going to matter there. and I also don't really know how much gaming will be affected by a faster SSD.

was looking around as much as I could to try to make sense of it, but I'm not sure which benchmarks match my use-case and if I really need those super duper high speeds. I care more about it feeling like it has really low latency than being able to transfer at 3GB/s for example.

it will be an all-rounder and 1TB would be ideal, but we don't really have the same deals here in Europe as the ones I see over in the United States. I would like to not spend more than 250 euros, but I also don't want to over-spend.

reliability, temperature and ability to handle rather mixed workloads- would be the TL;DR.

perhaps going for something with a nice warranty would be a good peace of mind.

also worth noting that I currently have a Sandisk Extreme Pro S-ATA SSD which is doing quite well, but it's far too small.

* First, many of these papers are very out of date. The average publication year is before 2000 with only 2 papers from the past 10 years. This doesn't mean you need to be only looking at current working papers but these methods, topics, and standards are quite different then used today.

* Second, the topic matter is heavily focused on macro-economics. Aside, from the ""Mariel Boatlift"" papers (of which there are better modern versions of) and the UN ticket these are primarily macroeconomics or other very big macro adjacent topics. There does not appear to be much microeconomics with from what I can tell there is no IO, no environmental, and 2 labor. Nor is there any game theory/behavioral papers. The only experimental paper is old, highly contentious, and could be better replaced with a modern paper like Agan and Starr's work on ban the box legislation. 

* Third, the authors are almost uniformly white/europeans. The only possible non-europeans authors are one who is Turkish and 2 that may be Hispanic. The lack of notable non-white economic including Raj Chetty, Roland Fryer, Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, Peter Blair, Damon jones,  Lisa D. Cook, among others is deeply troubling. 

* Fourth, this list has zero female authors. Economics may only have a massive gender disparity problem but its tough to take a draw of 21 names when ~20% of the names are female and not get a single women. This only serves to reinforce outdated and toxic stereotypes about our profession. Consider work by Christina Romer, Elinor Ostrom, Annie Case, Susan Dynarski , Esther Duflo, Claudia Golden, Pinelopi Goldberg, Meradeath Fowlie, Jennifer Dolaic, Janet Currie, Rhonda Sharpe, Catherine Maclean, Shelly Lundberg, Betsey Stevenson, among many many more.

TLDR: Taken together, these issues suggest this list is out of date and not representative of economics research in regard to topics, race, and gender. You should do much better.

He created a propaganda machine and any negative news was deemed ""fake news"" (lugenpresse). He riled up the masses against minority groups, including immigrants, Jews, blacks and Romani people (Gypsies). 

In 1936, 3 years after Adolf Hitler became chancellor (he became supreme leader of Germany in 1934 after Hindenburg died and Hitler combined the position of chancellor and president into one role: Führer), the concentration camps were still far away. In fact, the death camps wouldn't come until 1941. The work camps (the concentration camps/internment camps) came shortly after the invasion of Poland in September 1939. 

And the Kristalnacht didn't happen until 4 years after he was chancellor (1937). That was the night that hate against Jews became so overpowering that Germans, mostly Nazi party members and devoted supporters of Hitler attacked Jewish businesses and left a few dead. 

Now, to recap, it took Hitler **6 years** to go from the start of Chancellor to starting a war in Europe. 4 years to go from Chancellor to people attacking minorities en masse. 

Even the most conservative estimate, that is, from his Presidency to the Kristalnacht took 3 years to happen. Before that, he actually helped the economy and most Germans. He dragged the country out of a depression. How? Through infrastructure and military spending. The pre-war Nazi German military was being heavily funded almost as soon as he became Führer. 

Trump has taken practically all of these steps in his presidency at one point or another, except start a war and killed people en masse, but he still has almost 4 fucking years. 

You're a fucking imbecile if you can't see any semblance between early Nazi Germany and today's America. The weakest members of society are being fucked over. Minorities are being fucked over. And ICE has started to look awfully much like the SD. How long until an equivalency of the Gestapo is created to arrest immigrants in the middle of the night?

Trump is like if Hitler and Stalin had a child with ADHD and the full incompetence of them both in the later stages of their lives (thankfully, or else more people would be dead) with no compassion for his own countrymen. Trump also has apparently only one book by the side of his bed. A book about Hitler's speeches. No Bible (not that it matters, it's a shite book), no novels, no books to learn from the mistakes of history. Just Hitler's speeches. Although he did confuse it for fucking Mein Kampf. Hitler's best selling hit!

So compare Hitler and Trump again, but now from 1933-1936 and 2016-2019. You will see that there are similarities, although both advanced in different fields (Trump has gotten the concentration camps faster, but both called out the press for lying pretty much immediately. They also both provoked their supporters into attacking protesters. Look up Heather Hayer and Charlottesville for more). 

In short, Trump is incompetent, as well as his administration and thank fucking God, cause otherwise the US would be knee deep in blood. Trump is also lucky to have had a good economy when he got in, cause he would never have been able to drag the US out of a depression, let alone a depression like the one Germany went through. Hitler did use similar methods though, by pumping tons and tons of money into the military industrial complex, which inflated the economy and gave a much stronger picture of how things were going than they actually were. He also promoted Germany, German goods and wanted Germany to be self sustained. Which is where ""Lebensraum"" comes from. Unfortunately, it required a large portions of Europe and mass deportation of people, which then became unsustainable way of getting rid of them, which in turn became the death camps.

Half the reason all our merchant (investment) banks died and clearing (commercial) banks fucked off out of investment banking is because the Big Bang basically did to our financial sector what unilateral tariff and standard-dropping would to agriculture/fishing/any number of other industries. We dropped all the barriers just like that in October 1986, simply expecting that American and European banks couldn't compete with British spunk and City expertise.

They all got murdered by mistakes their balances couldn't handle in the new world of truly international banking. When our commercial banks tried to get into investment banking, they had the money but not the expertise.

What they needed was time to adjust to the way banking had changed globally as they really reintegrated; time to get over the old clearing-merchant divide; time to get used to the more ruthless cut-and-thrust of the American way (especially the brutal competition for employees between firms that contrasted with the more paternalistic 'we pay you well, we take care of you, and poaching is ungentlemanly' of the old City).

I highly doubt that Trump trusts any of these leaders. He is trying to establish a positive connection to maintain peace. Not to join sides. 

If this were the case why is he so hostile to our European allies then? Why has he refused to say a word against Putin even when Putin isn't around? I don't want more stupid wars against every country that goes against what we want, but he seems to fawn over these murdering thugs. He doesn't act the same towards every foreign leader.

&gt; Nothing really to argue here either except that Bernie Sanders also hasn’t released his taxes either but that’s derailing the argument... 

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html

This argument is a little outdated, though it happened very recently and Bernie should have released them earlier as well. However, at this point, Trump stands alone in his lack of transparency and it only makes those of us who don't like him more suspicious of his motivations and finances.

&gt; In what way? 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/ivanka-trump/

https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-top-secret-security-clearance-donald-trump-white-1355094

His daughter now has a job in the White House for some reason. I may be wrong but I believe it is a paid job as well. The security clearances are even worse. Why in the world would any child of the president who is not in the military or high level of government need security clearances? It is blatant nepotism and corruption and sets a dangerous precedent.

&gt; Had no idea about the gun thing... definitely don’t agree with that. I assume he keeps pushing off the subpoenas because they keep coming one after another almost like a filibuster. Keep Trump in court with subpoenas until next election... not an excuse for him to get out of it, but since there was no Russian Collusion, he definitely believes that is the case or else you’re right and he would just do whatever they say. I imagine it was similar to the Obama birth certificate thing where the President kept pushing it off because he said it was distracting Americans from real issues before ultimately giving in and releasing his records. 

This may totally discredit everything I have said so far in your eyes, but I take issue with your ""no Russian collusion"" claim. I read the Mueller Report when it came out because I was very eager to see what it said, and Barr and Mueller both said that they could not exonerate Trump from obstruction of justice. Mueller went so far as to say that he would have if he could have, and that the law that a sitting president could not be indicted was the only reason there weren't charges filed.

The Mueller Report said that they could not prove there was collusion, which to be fair is the burden of guilt required in this country. However if there was obstruction, which the report makes it clear there was, then it would be easy to prevent such evidence of collusion from being found. I think saying ""no Russian collusion"" is a stretch given these circumstances.

As for the taking guns with no due process, here is the evidence.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-take-the-guns-first-go-through-due-process-second/2018/02/28/4f767df6-1cec-11e8-98f5-ceecfa8741b6_video.html?utm_term=.6aec5e14cef3

&gt; He has had multiple big time celebrities make jokes about his assassination and millions of people still wish death upon him. While I can see where you’re coming from, I would argue that these are reactions to some of the vile things that are said about him, fairly or unfairly. 

This is true and those celebrities are idiots who only hurt the cause. Their words are indefensible, however I could argue the same point that you do, that their words could be reactions to the many vile things Trump says routinely. 

""I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad."" -Trump

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html

I did watch your three minute video and I wanted to show you some of the violent things Trump has said. As to Obama's comments, I found most of them were definitely aggressive, but not violent. I do see your point and I think those statements were wrong but let me break them down for you.

Telling his supporters to argue and get in the faces of Republicans is aggressive, not violent, though it certainly doesn't help bring Republicans around, though Republicans in Congress were against him completely from day one. https://www.politico.com/story/2010/10/the-gops-no-compromise-pledge-044311

Calling Republicans ""the enemy"" of Latinos is also aggressive and inappropriate, but it isn't a threat of violence.

The last one, where Obama said ""If your opponent brings a knife to a fight, you bring a gun,"" may very well be violent, but bringing a knife to a gun fight is a common expression that is often used outside of violent situations so I would like to see the context of that statement before conceding that it is a call to violence.

Apesar de mais de 20 anos de negociações entre os dois blocos, o governo francês afirmou, nesta terça-feira, que o país não está pronto para ratificar o pacto. ""Vamos observar com atenção e, com base nestes detalhes, vamos decidir"", declarou o porta-voz do governo francês, Sibeth Ndiaye, em uma entrevista ao canal de notícias francês BFM. No Brasil, as declarações do porta-voz francês foram minimizadas pelo ministro das Relações Exteriores, [Ernesto Araújo](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/ernesto_henrique_fraga_araujo), que afirmou que esse tipo de manifestação é dirigida ao público interno.

 ""O acordo nem está pronto para ser votado. O processo de ratificação certamente dependerá do parlamento francês. Mas, neste momento, nenhum país está pronto para ratificar, diante da questão constitucional"", afirmou o chanceler em coletiva de imprensa no Palácio do Itamaraty. Segundo Araújo, a Comissão Europeia mantém consultas permanentes aos estados-membros, deixando sempre os países a par do que está sendo negociado. ""Nada que está no acordo, a meu ver, é uma surpresa"", completou.

 A resistência da França, entretanto, não é novidade. O país é um dos mais reticentes ao acordo pois teme os efeitos sobre o setor agrícola, que pode seria afetado pela grande entrada de produtos sul-americanos no mercado.

 Para entrar em vigor, o pacto entre o Mercosul e a UE ainda precisa tanto de avaliação jurídica quanto do aval do Parlamento europeu e dos legislativos de cada país-membro dos blocos.“É um processo que tende a ser lento. São 33 parlamentos. Mas pelo interesse que tem para todos os países, inclusive para a França, esperamos que seja acelerado”, disse Araújo.

 Há um grupo, entretanto, resistente ao acordo, tanto na França como em outros países europeus. São os ambientalistas que estão de olho na preservação do meio ambiente brasileiro. Pouco após as declarações do porta-voz Ndiaye, o ministro do meio ambiente francês, François de Rugy, afirmou que o tratado só será ratificado se o Brasil assumir seus compromissos, especialmente os referentes à luta contra o desmatamento na Amazônia. Na semana passada, o presidente Emmanuel Macron também já tinha ameaçado o fim de qualquer acordo comercial com o Brasil caso J[air Bolsonaro](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/jair_messias_bolsonaro) decidisse sair do acordo climático de Paris. Porém, segundo Araújo, não há nenhum motivo de preocupação sobre os franceses. ""Tenho certeza que todas essas preocupações que a França possa ter já estão contempladas em diversos pontos do acordo”, completou. Ainda segundo o chanceler, há “total compromisso” do Governo brasileiro contra o desmatamento. “Toda a nossa política é de preservação e utilização sustentável dos recursos naturais”.

 O ministro exigiu ainda que os mesmos compromissos ambientais sejam também aplicados por todos os outros países que agora fazem parte do pacto. ""Também esperamos ver implementados, inclusive, os compromissos deles, que são os países desenvolvidos, como desembolsos de recursos para financiamento de energias renováveis"", disse.

 O desmatamento da Amazônia em junho deste ano foi de 769 quilômetros quadrados entre 1 e 28 de junho, segundo sistema Terra Brasilis, do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). É o segundo maior desmatamento desde junho de 2016, quando a prática alcançou 951 quilômetros quadrados.

 ### Novos acordos neste ano

 Em conversa com a imprensa, Araújo afirmou que o acordo histórico do Mercosul com a UE abre caminho para outras parcerias comerciais. Segundo o ministro, a intenção do Governo brasileiro é celebrar outras dois acordos ainda neste ano. O chanceler não especificou quais seriam eles, mas disse que as negociação estão mais avançadas com a Associação Europeia de Livre Comércio (EFTA) - grupo de quatro países que não fazem parte da UE: Suíça, Noruega, Islândia e Liechtenstein - Canadá, Singapura e Coreia do Sul.“Não serão acordos nos mesmos moldes da UE. Cada acordo tem que seguir um modelo diferente. Cada parceiro tem características diferentes“, disse.

 Com a vigência do acordo Mercosul-UE, 92% das exportações do bloco sul-americano para o europeu serão isentas de tarifas em um período de dez anos. Já a UE terá zeradas tarifas sobre 91% dos produtos que exporta para o Mercosul. O pacto é um marco histórico no relacionamento entre os dois blocos, que representam, juntos, cerca de 25% do PIB mundial e um mercado de 780 milhões de pessoas.

**Owarimonogatari episódios 14-15 – Mayoi Hell**

Para ser sincero não sinto que eu tenha algo a dizer sobre este arco, porque ele lida abertamente com os mistérios envolvendo o acontecimento com o Tadatsuru, a morte do Araragi pela Izuko e o reencontro dele com a Hachikuji, mas um ponto interessante pode ser a discussão sobre erros e acertos, se seria realmente possível fazer certo desde o início ou se a única solução seria corrigir os erros ao longo do tempo.

Araragi reafirma que faria tudo novamente nos casos da Shinobu, Hanekawa, Senjougahara e Hachikuji, mas que com o caso da Nadeko ele se sentiu impotente e queria poder fazer o certo à partir do início – desde o reencontro deles em Bake –  mas Hachikuji afirma não ser possível fazer tudo corretamente o tempo inteiro; que Araragi não é onipotente, o que leva ele a querer discutir um pouco se corrigir os erros ao longo do tempo levaria a um *pure white kind of right*, mas conclui que o resultado seria um **pitch-black kind of right**, em outras palavras, que o ato continuo de correção de erros não levaria a um tipo ideal de resultado, mas sim a um resultado que funcionaria, mas a moralidade por trás dele é obscura. Só que, como apontado pela Hachikuji, antes de se pensar no tipo de correção resultante, é preciso que haja primeiro um agente externo que avalie os pontos passíveis de correção.

Essa conversa leva a interessantes questionamentos sobre autocrítica e de quem deveria ser o papel do crítico. Araragi sente que estaria falando não dele, mas de Oshino Ougi, mas de onde viria essa suspeita que Ougi agiria como o papel do crítico? No último episódio de Oni, Araragi pergunta à Ougi qual seria o trabalho que ela estaria fazendo no momento, ao qual Ougi responde:

&gt; Normal work.

&gt; If I were to liken it to something, it’s work as commonplace as the overwhelming darkness that comprises most of this world.

&gt; I right wrongs and bring to an end that which must end.

&gt; If I had to be specific, I guess my job involves punishing liars.

Seria a falha de se fazer o certo desde o inicio um ato mentiroso quando não se age continuamente na correção dos erros decorrentes dessa falha?

Ao menos esse é o questionamento lógico que, a meu ver, surge ao se conectar esses dois pontos e a conclusão de Owari, Ougi Dark, deve ao menos elucidar um pouco não só esse ponto, mas também outros pontos discutidos em Mayoi Hell.

Letra de terminal terminal, [OP de Mayoi Hell.](https://animethemes.moe/video/OwarimonogatariS2-OP1.webm)

&gt; Nothing has changed

&gt; Every day you welcome me with the same gentle smile

&gt; When I see you like that

&gt; I think how nice it would be

&gt; If I could be someone like you

&gt; This beloved place doesn’t want me to go home yet

&gt; But, hey, that’s the place I call home!

&gt; You perform miracles at a probability of ten billion to one

&gt; As long as you’re here

&gt; As long as you exist

&gt; Hey, however many times

&gt; I’m home! I’m starving!

&gt; What hour, minute, second?

&gt; How many times has the Earth rotated? Now!

&gt; As much as I think of you

&gt; You think of me just as much

&gt; Is this what you call “Happiless”?

&gt; Forgive me! I’m home! I bit my tongue!

Essa é a primeira vez que eu leio a letra de terminal terminal agora que consegui subs melhores e, simplificando o significado dela, acho que é evidente que é praticamente uma carta de amor da Hachikuji pro Araragi, mostrando os sentimentos que ela sente por ele, e o quão importante ele é na vida dela, após ter morrido e ter se transformado no *Lost Cow*.

Mr. Trump recently dropped plans to nominate two other picks, conservative pundit Stephen Moore and onetime Republican presidential contender Herman Cain. Both of them withdrew from consideration after Republican senators expressed reservations about their personal backgrounds, policy views and qualifications for the job.

Ms. Shelton was confirmed by the Senate for her current EBRD role by a voice vote in 2018.

Mr. Waller, a trained economist, holds a Ph.D. from Washington State University and headed the University of Notre Dame’s economics department before joining the St. Louis Fed in 2009.

Ms. Shelton and Mr. Waller didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Trump has recently escalated his criticism of the central bank for raising interest rates last year and called on it to lower interest rates. Doing so would allow the economy to take off like a “rocket ship,” he said April 5.

I think you are forgetting that their was an annexation of territory IN EUROPE just a few years ago.

&gt; and the fighting was by-and-large done by Iraq and Syria... so the issue resolved itself in a local manner.

I don't think you are very familiar with what actually happened.  Without the US support (and to a lesser extent UK, Russia, and Iran), ISIS would still control large swaths of Iraq and Syria.

&gt; I don't believe they're [Iran] a threat to the homeland or our citizens.

What about the terrorists they fund all over the middle east?  What about the drug cartels they are working with in Central America?  What about their threats to close off the Strait of Hormuz and cause a global oil shortage?

Yeah, you realize our military presence in Europe is much smaller than it was during the cold war. right?  You realize our allies are actually asking for us to send more troops to Europe because they are scared of Russian aggression (as evidenced by Ukraine and Georgia).

You keep saying this like it is a fact, when it is very much not.  There is nothing other than US deterrence keeping a major power war from happening right now.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/24/arab-world-turns-its-back-on-religion-and-its-ire-on-the-us

This recent report on the Arab world said that just under 40% in many countries are contemplating migrating without proper documentation. I feel this contradicts what you're saying. I think you are seriously underestimating how much of the flow of people is due to economic migration.

&gt;Also, to say that any country would become uninhabitable due to migrants shows that lack of respect people have for hard working migrants

This is a pretty facile interpretation of the point being made. A country's infrastructure can only take on so much and in the case of large inflows of people that often **cannot** be absorbed readily into the workforce then no, the migration does not benefit the company economically.

You bring out the old cliche of 'immigrants do the work natives don't won't'... Just how many low skill jobs do you think are actually available in a country like Italy where there is rampant unemployment? And don't you understand that increasing automation is only leading to a greater sparsity of low skilled labour jobs?

&gt;They pay taxes just like everyone else and contribute to the growth and development of our nation.

As I've already covered, many cannot be absorbed into the workforce either due to a lack of skills, language or simply no work opportunities. Likewise even when one does obtain a low skill job that won't necessarily represent a net contribution to the state coffers such as in cases where large tax credits and benefits are availed of due to having children. 

Unemployment rates amongst such migrants are already very high in nearly all European countries so your assertion that we can absorb more to 'do the jobs that natives don't' is plain juvenile.

&gt;If there was no work for them to do then they would return.

Once again an assertion that appears to have come off the top of your head and had no basis in reality.
Exactly would would someone return to a country with much lower quality of life if they are able to live in Western Europe and obtain state benefits?

[],,Interpine,1523304421.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_161svv9a,False,[],"Soft power is largerly a new-ish term for PR. This can come in direct forms (Voice of America and other transparent ""mouthpieces"" of governments) and indirectly through the cultural programs you mentioned. The governments of many countries, most prominently Russia, China, South Korea, and Turkey all have mechanisms to subsidize and ""shape"" their media output to be more flattering to the regime. Among them, South Korea and Turkey have been by far the most successful, with South Korea creating a music wave and Turkish soaps dominating a wide foreign market, and portraying unapologetic neo-Ottomanism to their mostly Slavic, Latino and Arabic viewers. One could argue the BBC is another example of a successful state-controlled media outlet, but in this case they don't support one political faction or ideology in particular: they just make Britain look cooler.

You can also have a great amount of cultural influence just by being a big country. Most people are intrinsically biased to their own country, so the anime industry and Hollywood unsurprisingly usually spread the ideas of their home countries. They aren't state controlled, but are widely influential simply because their home countries are huge.

But soft power takes other angles besides cultural influence. A great example of what you might call ""covert soft power"" is Iran's highly successful overseas propaganda campaign, which has seized complete control of the Middle Eastern narrative in the West. The Iranians have successfully convinced many in the West of three key lies, 1) that President Rouhani is the real power in Iran, 2) that Syria and Iraq are functionally independent countries, and have armies, and 3) that the Saudi regime and army are ""incompetent"".

In reality, it has been conclusively proven since 2016 that both the Iraqi and Syrian regimes have been bankrupt for years and entirely dependent on Iranian financing. The armies of those countries have virtually collapsed - the number of Ba'athist SAA soldiers is estimated at less than 20,000 - and the majority of their formal ""militaries"" are actually Iranian-backed militiamen self-identifying as ""army battalions"". To make matters worse, most of the ""Assadist"" fighters today are Shi'a jihadis Iran imported from its own country, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon. Iran has succeeded in covert invasions in a way that must make Russia jealous.

On this note, Russia is an example of a state that has utterly failed at the game of covert or overt soft power. Its media output is mostly for domestic consumption, and poorly consumed, with many popular idols being openly critical of the government. Its overseas ""covert soft power"" campaign, unlike the Iranian campaign, is too heavy handed and obvious. Russian leaders, generally former security and intelligence officials, seem to bask in their new image as comic book villains, masterfully manipulating events behind the scenes. Where Russia went wrong and Iran went right is arguably in degrees of separation. While Russia's overseas media outlets deliberately try to portray Putin as the ""good guy"" and directly attack the Western establishment, Iran's only try to distract attention away from everyting they want to keep secret by criticizing both enemies and friends alike. Iran has successfully blamed Russia and Assad (who has been nothing more than the public face of the Iranian province of Syria since 2012) for all the atrocities their own foreign fighters have committed in Syria, and has convinced the West of a completely wacky narrative in Yemen (Saudis being ""incompetent"" and indiscriminately bombing civilians, while in reality the Saudis are badly outnumbered and fighting in a giant mountain). The Iranians have skillfully taken advantage of Western prejudices by only bashing easy targets such as the Saudis and their own allies, while Russia attempts a ""frontal assault"" against Western opinion leaders.

Another example of a largely failed soft power campaign is that of the PRC. The PRC uses ""money censorship"" in Hollywood by inviting only a select number of foreign films to China and forcing them to pay lip service to the CCP. This has had exactly zero effect on anything. Internally, the CCP's domestic entertainment machine has been in trouble for years now, with the youth turning away from the older generation's Communist World War 2 dramas, and recent revolutionary movies flopping - most notably Jackie Chan's 1911. Overseas, the most popular Chinese films are Hong Kong kung fu movies that don't flatter the CCP at all. I'd reason the PRC's failure stems more from not knowing what to do than doing the wrong thing and getting giddy about their resulting villainous image, ala Russia.

So in summary, if you're trying to increase your soft power, the best solution is ""be a big, rich country"". However, if you don't have that avenue available to you, you can do 2 things:

1. Create proxy press outlets and feed information to foreigners that confirms their existing bias and racial prejudices, instead of going against them. Your aim here is to distract attention away from your crimes, not to make them seem good. Russia for example would be better served launching a PR assault against ""backwards, incompetent"" Ukraine and ""whiny, irrelevant"" Baltic states than their current strategy of waging a full scale war against the very idea of Western democracy.

2. Notice talent in your entertainment industry and promote shows that fill foreign niches. Turkey has produced three blockbuster game of thrones-esque shows in the last decade by noticing that very few shows center around court intrigue and portrayed conquerors in a positive light. Recently, they've exploited the Middle East and Eastern Europe's concepts of masculinity with Dirilis Ertugrul. China would be better served trying to spin its hard sci-fi and kung fu productions instead of censoring random Hollywood movies.

In any soft power campaign, the producer has to assume its credibility is zero. Similar to a salesman trying to gain access to a big company, a regime trying to sell itself to foreigners needs to understand their biases and pitch accordingly.

&gt;**Any image of a dead child is always harrowing, for everyone but the most deranged psychopaths among us.**  If the child has drowned while seeking a better life it is possibly  worse. The public reaction of politicians to such images, which varies  from doing very little, or nothing, to solve the issues that have led to  a child drowning, to trying to make cheap political gains from the  image, must be the worst.  
&gt;  
&gt;On September 2 2015, this photo of Syrian Kurdish 2 year-old Alan  Kurdi, lifeless on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey, went viral. Almost 4  years later, all Europe has done is try to hide the problems that led to  his death, by handing Turkey billions of euros to keep refugees inside  that country. [**And still today conditions in Lesbos, Greece are appalling.**](http://www.ekathimerini.com/242049/article/ekathimerini/news/violence-at-moria-as-migrant-arrivals-on-lesvos-spike) Hardly a thing has changed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Improvements to the situation that lead to Alan Kurdi’s death, within  Syria itself, have had very little to do with European efforts. Russia  had a much bigger role in that. And Syria is not the only source, or  place, of troubles and refugees. Libya has turned into an open air slave  market thanks to US and EU “efforts” under Obama. And Iraq is not  exactly a land of milk and honey either. Or Afghanistan.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then this week another picture of a drowned child made the frontpages -and more. **That  child, too, drowned due to a situation that has a long history: the US  seeking to turn Central America into a dirt-poor, chaotic and unsafe  environment that local people desperately want to escape.** Same difference. And again, in the US and EU it is used as propaganda material.

**Afossa:** Afossa is based on southern Russia and the Mongols as well as the general steppe culture. Afossa is based in the Etareron Valley on the great wide steppes. The Afossan people are tremendously different, being split along the harsh class divide, but tend to share some of the same aspects in their cultures. The steppes have bred its natives to be more serious and aloof than many peoples of the west. Most of the population tend to be competitive with their peers (aggressively or otherwise) but subservient to those who they perceive to be ‘above’ them. The peasants do cooperate with each other, leading pastoral lives and paying tribute to their overlords, but hostilies grow as one rises the social pyramid. Afossans are accustomed to change, largely due to their nomadic lives, and find rhythm in any sort of deviance from the norm; however, they tend to reject radical or unpredictable change. Typically, the people of the Etareron Valley tend to be worldly, orderly, and serious, but difficult to agitate. They also strongly value the importance of the family unit, a belief that stems from the Khanate’s strong ties to the worship of Tenebris (Tenebrity)

&amp;#x200B;

Life in the Khanate revolves around Tenebris. The social structure, their architecture, their festivals, their very culture: all are related to the Dark God in some way. Worship of Tenebris began in Afossa, and since its foundation in ancient times it has persisted and ingrained itself into every aspect of daily life in the Khanate. The Khanate is, in a way, a theocracy: the emperor of Afossa, known as the Darkhny, is believed to be the vessel of the divine power, and that all must be subservient by their rule. Tales of their religion are widespread and passed down through the works of poets and sages, and the entire population adheres to the conservative beliefs of the religion that value family and defense. Afossa lacks permanent settlements (save for a few fortress-cities built around temples) but scattered throughout the countryside are shrines of Tenebris – many of which are built like castles and can be defended as such. True to the tenants of their religion, Afossans strongly value the importance of stratification and order: everything has a place in the universe, and to change the order of things is generally frowned upon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Venator**: Venator is based on south-eastern Europe. Most people view it as a single nation but in actuatity, it is three, northern, central, and southern Venator and each have very different cultures and terrains.

&amp;#x200B;

Southern Venator is extremely boisterous and ""loud"" in all things. The streets of Kamarvan are full of colorful banners and clothes, musicians play on the corners of the streets, and the people are not afraid of starting up conversations with random people on the streets, it is well known for its friendliness. The land of southern Venator is almost entirely swamplands and bayous. The culture and terrain is a lot like Louisiana meets Constantinople.

&amp;#x200B;

Central Venator is more dower and extremely farm-centric. Its nobles and lords are constantly fighting battles over territory and it is a land covered in ruins and bandits much of the time. Its vast tracks of forest and plains are covered in scattered towns, castles, and settlements.

&amp;#x200B;

Northern Venator is far more warlike than the other two. It is the main area that combats the Sevardais invaders and afossan raiders. It is mostly based around iron and coal mining and has a strong military infrastructure.

&amp;#x200B;

Militaristically Venator generally is based around large shield formations and heavy crossbows with polearms. The hilly and rocky terrain of northern Venator favors hill forts and extremely defensive fighting. This has largely countered the Sevardais offensive and the two nations have been in a stalemate for years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kalendia**: Kalendia is based on eastern Europe (Czechia, Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary mostly). Kalendia is located on an incredibly defensible plateau with few effective pathways up that makes it incredibly difficult to attack. However, if one did attack and succeed at invading they would find very little of value. The mountains of Kalendia have long since been mined of almost anything of value, the soil is thin and of a poor quality, the people and nobility are scattered and don't really care about each other, few really having any idea that there is more than their town or bit of territory. Its people almost never see tax collectors or any form of larger scale government.

&amp;#x200B;

Officially, Kalendia is a feudal monarchy – it is ruled by a king and the nobles beneath him lord over fiefdoms of their own. This, however, is only what law proclaims the system to be. In actuality, Kalendia operates primarily as a cultural identity first and a cohesive nation second. With regards to the latter, the Kalendian government operates more like a league of city states than an actual monarchy. Since there is so little to hold power over in the nation, rulership is decentralized and nobles act with a fairly high level of autonomy. The king himself is little more than a glorified lord, as the title of ‘king’ is simply granted to the noble who owns the capital city of Baekenheim. Regardless, each fief operates as though it were its own independent duchy, and yet themselves still exert little practical authority over the surrounding lands. Despite this, peace once again prevails due to strong family ties between members of the upper class and dauntless apathy (and ignorance) from the lower class. While the nobility may treat politics with the same level of seriousness as one may find in other nations, they are largely rendered pointless by the autonomy of Kalendian commoners and lords alike.",True,False,False,,0,1562131706,,1562132392,0,{},esngb4f,True,t3_c8k1vc,False,False,t1_esnfmeu,/r/worldbuilding/comments/c8k1vc/the_world_of_umbra_lothen_etareron_and_lockdells/esngb4f/,False,,1571302001,4,True,[],False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,r/worldbuilding,public,0,

It does use a bunch of resources during initial sync.  There are some hardware recommendations (e.g., SSD drive) to help sync occur faster -- though they are not necessary.  Eventually your client will have all the blocks downloaded and maintain sync.

Now if you were asking about mining ... (to earn bitcoin), ...  that's something that bitcoin miners do.  If you wanted to enter that industry there is a large capital expenditure and operations costs, as well as a big learning curve.

And you probably wouldn't want to unless you pay an really low rate for electricity (e.g., $0.08 per kWh or less).

So when your Bitcoin Core wallet has reached sync, and you've ensured you have encrypted it and made a backup, ... then you might want to use an exchange to obtain bitcoins.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card (e.g., 247Exchange, CEX.io, Coinify, CoinCorner, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreleand, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified. For paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover) there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co).

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [NO KYC (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are also physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations &lt;-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange are probably your next best options:

It has no logic. Especially for a game that costs £7.40 and has a small player base.

Or could it be, which makes more sense, by putting the game on shelves in stores will promote it more. More shoppers will see it as they walk around. See its picture next to other games. Think “what’s this?” And “that’s cheep. I could pick that up”. Thus growing the player base and making the devs more money. It’s advertising the game more. Getting its image out there.

&gt;   
&gt; Desde ayer todos los autos eléctricos e híbridos de nueva homologación que se comercialicen en Europa deberán ofrecer obligatoriamente un **sistema de sonido artificial**. Es para evitar siniestros causados por la falta de ruido de este tipo de propulsión, que hace que **peatones y ciclistas no los escuchen**.
&gt; 
&gt; La norma fijada por la Unión Europea (UE) ya entró en vigor. A partir del **primero de julio de 2021** regirá para todos los vehículos eléctricos que se vendan en el Viejo Continente, y no solo los homologados bajo los **últimos protocolos**.
&gt; 
&gt; De esta forma, se le da tiempo a las automotrices a ir incorporando el **sistema de aviso acústico** (AVAS, por sus siglas en inglés) paulatinamente a medida que **modernizan sus productos**.

&gt; 
&gt; Un auto eléctrico cuando se enciende **no hace ruido**. Por lo general una luz verde en el tablero indica que está listo. Y al avanzar, al no tener un motor a explosión, **tampoco emite sonido**. Lo mismo pasa con los híbridos que, si bien tienen un motor a combustión, justamente **a baja velocidad no lo utilizan**.

Here is my feedback of the gig. Please acknowledge that’s my own experience and I just wonder if anybody else experienced the same thing.

I found the sound of the Altice Arena horrible. I was on a seated place, 1st row of the 1st Balcony. On the right side of the scene. 30/40 meters from the band.
The sound was extremely loud. The balances weren’t so great. Maynard voice was recovered by the instruments most of the time. The first 2 songs were just a cacophony for me and atop from that the reverb was insane.
My earplugs didn’t help with any of this issues I had last night and I thought they worsened the show... 

So ye... I was so excited about the gig, seeing for the first time one of my favourite band and I ended up very very disppointed with the result.

1. Pusul unor garduri nu rezolva problema.... tramvaiul tot ramane o optiune desueta/ mizerabila pt trasnport in comun. Tramvai = investitii majore in sina ( pe care o uzeaza si o distrug atat tramvaiele cat si masinile) + congestie ( tramvaiul este pe mijlocul drumului si daca face stanga sau dreapta a blocat fluxul de masini prin intersectie si da, nu toate intersectiile au semafoare speciale pentru tramvai)+ tramvaiul ocupa o banda si jumatate per sens, prin sina, gard si ocazional statia in sine din mijlocul drumului.. Realitatea este ca daca vrei transport electric ( din motive ce tin de strategie/ diversitate energetica), trolezubul este solutia mult mai eleganta ( circula pe partea drapta a drumului, nu necesita statii speciale fata de autobuz, asemeni tramvaiului necesita un fir de inalta tensiune dar nu necesita si sina + poate evita obstacole intr-o limita rezonabila.

2. Problema cu 41 este ca daca opresti acest ”metrou usor” nu mai alta varianta rezonabila ca sa ajungi sa iti faci treaba. Realitatea este ca trebuiau sa introduca un alt sistem/ mod de transport inainte ca opreasca 41 pt modernizare. 41 in sine este o improvizatie mizera de ”metrou usor”... LUMEA VREA METROU REAL.

3. Da bucurestenii vor parcari, dar ca bucurestean nu ma ajuta o parcare la Straulesti daca eu stau la Vitan/ Dristor/ Bracoveanu. Parcarea de la straulesti nu este pt bucurestenti ci este pt locuitorii din afara bucurestului care lucreaza in Bucuresti. Noi vrem parcari la noi in cartiere, nu la mama dracu. Eu sunt un caz fericit ca am loc de parcare in ansamblul rezidential, pentru ca as turba sa imi caut loc de parcare pe langa bloc. Problema este ca toate terenurile virane ADP au fost vandute si tranformate in blocuri + faptul ca nu toate aceste blocuri au suficiente locuri de parcare pt nr. de apartamente + chiar daca au, lumea nu cumpara pt ca ”gasesc loc pe strada”. La mn in ansamblu multi nu au vrut sa cumpere loc de parcare (in prima faza), astfel eu am reusit sa cumpar 2 desi pt moment am numai o masina, acum.... vor sa cumpere dar nu mai ce sa cumpere. Ma rog,... am deviat de la subiect... imi cer scuze. Concluzie: VREM PARCARI IN CARTIERE NU LA MAMA DRAQ!

4. Referitor la zgomotul de la santierul Decebal. NU ESTE NORMAL SA FIE ZGOMOT NOAPTEA. Muncesc o zi intreaga in zgomot, trebuie sa dorm in liniste. Realiatea este ca se freaca menta ziua de trebuie sa lucreze si noapte ca tot sa depaseasca termenul de predare cu 1-2 ani ( vezi magistrala drumul taberei). Referitor la omolire, si unde sa puna intrarea...ai dreptate acolo, lumea chiarmai comenteaza si aiurea.

5. Revenind la masini, nu mi se aplica dar daca mi-ar ridica masina pt ca nu am unde sa parchez nu rezolva problema pt ca mi-o recuperez si tot acolo sunt nevoit sa o pun pt ca nu am altundeva. De acord, sa se ridice masinite de pe torotuare sau din zonele unde exista locuri de parcare libere ( desi sunt locuri de parcare in piata victoriei la 5 sau 10 lei ora... lumea baga masina pe trotouar.. not cool).

6. Referitor la asteptarile mele: vreau sa nu se mai dea avize de constructie in zone deja dezvoltate ( pt ca efectiv nu mai este loc de un ac in zone precum pipera/ tineretului/  etc). Orice teren ramas liber al statului sa fie facut spatiu verde ( copaci + banca, FARA TOPOGANE KITCH). Municipalitatea sa inceapa o campanie de expropriere pt a obtine terenurile ramare libere in zonele full pentru la folosi in scopul mentionat anterior.

Stop avizelor de constructie in nordul bucurestului. Daca am raspandi mai bine cladirile de birouri si prin alte zone/ puncte cardinale ale orasului poate nu ar pune asa presune pe magistrala M2/ metrou in general.

Si nu in ultimul rand... o problema a bucurestului nu poate fi oprita de catre municipalitate.... suprapopularea. Toata lumea vine in bucuresti. Guvernul si administratiile locale din alte orase ar trebui sa demareze un amplu proces de dezvoltare a infrastructurii/ sistemului de educatie din alte zone. Trebuie ca si celelalte orase sa se dezvolte ca sa se decongestioneze capitala. Acum efectiv perpetuam un lant vicios: toata lumea din orasul X pleaca si vine la bucuresti pentru ca aici au unde sa invete/ sa lucreze iar orasul X ramane fata forta de munca si va vedea niciun investitor din aceasta cauza si ciclul se repeta.

In incheiere, aici nu discutam de fatalism ci de o manifestare a unor frustari aucumulate din diverse nemultumiri ce tin de mediul in care traim ( locuri de parcare putine in zone in care este mare nevoie, gunoi neridicat, asfalare perpetua pe strazi, trotuare sparte, zgomot, manele, politie si administratie inaplta, taxe mari si in permanenta modificare, 2 ore pierdute zilnic in trafic pana la/ de la munca, arhiteura/ peisaj urban grotesc, caldura, cretini pe strada, etc.)..... este evident ca paharul se umple si revarsa periodic daca tot turnam in el.

The 2008 low was $2.58 or so. DB already got to the 2008 low for that a few years ago and kept going lower.

DB and Barclays bounced in 2009 and then have spend the last 10 years or so gradually going lower. Credit Suisse, too. UBS is a fraction of what it was in 2007. SocGen is now about back to the 2008 low. You mention the 5 year chart, look at the 10 year.

What's your thesis as to why any of this will turn around? It's not baffling that a major bank could be a penny stock, but even if this did gradually level out, it might not go really anywhere for a while.

""Plus, Barclays Center in Brooklyn will be popular given their new acquisitions for the Brooklyn Nets so that may boost morale for Barclays.""

1. I guess almost every human has people close to him/her when they die, which makes the death of said human a meaningful event and a tragedy for his/her loved ones. I know that ""200 killed in terror bombing in Iraq"" is for a lot of people around me in Central Europe ""just a statistic"" (paraphrased a quote by Stalin) but I also know people who do care, even though it is far away and they know none of the victims.
2. Especially on the internet I noticed that deaths mostly are just a statistic and are being used as some sort of reversed e-dick measurement and for propaganda. ""Nazis killed 6 million jews and then some"" ""but Mao killed 40 million"" ""but capitalism directly and indirectly killed about 100+ millions"". These numbers are also made purposely silly to somehow delegitimize the claims, as well as the facts and the research behind it. I know my opinion is biased but I mostly notice this from Fascists with ""muh 6 million"". However leftists also do that with ""Mao/Holodomor muh 20 gorillion"". All of these phrases lack total respect for both the victims as well as the scholars who published those numbers after their reasearch.
3. Now to adress the OP: What I personally absolutely do not like is this notion of ""a person dies within the USSR -&gt; he died because of socialism/communism"". For fairness' sake this applies to any other ideology too. Things like famines, droughts, illness, epidemics and natural disasters can occur under every ideology and system. Wars are a bit more tricky IMO. 
On the other hand it is just a fact that the realization of both Pol Pots and Adolf Hitlers twisted and disgusting thoughts (made possible by people obeying their orders for various reasons) are a clear case of ""an ideology was implented and it lead to the death and misery of a certain amount of people"".
So, all in all, I do not agree with anything close to 100 million being directly killed by socialism and communism but I also think that this whole numbers game is rather stupid.

The Europeans/Americans/Chinese/Martians that consider the Russian people to be savages are probably best described as 'idiots', 'insane' or, and this is my personal favourite, 'insane idiots'. I would say that that people are right however to criticise the dubious Russian governments, the unhealthy support such regimes receive and the siege mentality they promote, the lack of critical thinking when it comes to Russia's actions (both past and present). 

The USSR lost the cold war because it was a 'concentration camp' based on propaganda and mass murder (and at times the threat of it) for so long that by the time reform came, it was simply too late. These days Russia is using almost the same recipe (no mass murder this time, just regular murder here and there) and I'd reckon it will suffer the same consequences. It has managed to isolate itself, it constantly antagonizes its neigbours and has very few incentives to make new friends but instead of attempting to correct these faults it merely cries 'fascism' and 'Russophobia'.",True,False,False,,0,1562144033,,False,0,{},esnpyps,False,t3_c7u47f,False,True,t1_eslk1w7,/r/europe/comments/c7u47f/map_of_russia_in_1914_with_territory_lost_19141918/esnpyps/,False,,1571306594,1,True,[],False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,

Of course it is.. Parliament asked the public whether we should or shouldn't be in the EU, the public said 'out', and Parliament decided to run with that and take the UK out of the EU. The resulting legislation, and process to determine how the UK leaves is entirely something that Parliament has to deliver.

&gt;How post Brexit Britian looks and functions requires a mandate that parliament doesn't have.

How does Parliament not have a mandate? MP's are elected, they represent their constituents. They have a mandate to act on their behalf and should have been able to find a reasonable compromise position that takes the UK out of the EU with an agreement in place and a close relationship (as reflected by how close the vote was). 

&gt;My suspicion however is that Brexit won't survive another public vote.

It almost certainly would. Nothing much has changed, the EU remains unpopular.
