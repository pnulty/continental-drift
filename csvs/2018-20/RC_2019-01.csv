&gt; Roy Ayers (September 10, 1940) is an American funk, soul, and jazz composer and vibraphone player. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, which is a mixture of jazz into hip-hop and funk, and has been dubbed by many as ""The Godfather of Neo Soul"". He is most well known for his signature compositions ""Everybody Loves The Sunshine"" and ""Searchin"", and is also famous for having more sampled hits by rappers than any other artist.

&gt; Roy Ayers was born in Los Angeles. Thanks to his trombone playing father and piano teaching mother, he became immersed in music from day one and the story goes that he was given his first set of vibe mallets by his hero Lionel Hampton at the age of 5. Constantly performing and recording since the 1960s, he is one of the most famous jazz vibraphonists. He has produced some of the most loved modern soul-jazz records of all time such as, ""Everybody Loves The Sunshine"", most influential afro-jazz with musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti (Africa - Centre Of The World) and the most seminal jazz-funk, such as ""Running Away"". And that's just the surface. 2004 saw the release of ""Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased Recordings 1976-1981"" which were 'lost' sessions tapes that he had discarded. Gilles Peterson described this as the equivalent of finding a lost Beatles album. No doubt this helped him win the Gilles Peterson 2004 Worldwide Lifetime Achievement Award. Roy Ayers is ageless and evergreen and as per the title of another one of hits, remember ""We All Live In Brooklyn Baby"".

&gt; Timeline
Ayers started recording as a bebop sideman in 1962 and rose to prominence when he dropped out of City College and joined jazz flutist Herbie Mann in 1966.

&gt; In the early 70's, Roy Ayers started his own band called Roy Ayers Ubiquity, a name he chose because ubiquity means a state of being everywhere at the same time.

&gt; Ayers was responsible for the highly regarded soundtrack to Jack Hill's 1973 blaxploitation film Coffy, which starred Pam Grier. He later moved from a jazz-funk sound to R&amp;B, as seen on Mystic Voyage, which featured the songs ""Evolution"" and the underground disco hit ""Brother Green (The Disco King)"", as well as the title track from his 1976 album Everybody Loves the Sunshine.

&gt; In 1977, Ayers produced an album by the group RAMP, Come into Knowledge, commonly and mistakenly thought to stand for ""Roy Ayers Music Project"". That fall, he had his biggest hit with ""Running Away"".

&gt; In late 1979, Ayers scored his only top ten single on Billboard's Hot Disco/Dance chart with ""Don't Stop The Feeling,"" which was also the leadoff single from his 1980 album ""No Stranger to Love"", whose title track was sampled in Jill Scott's 2001 song ""Watching Me"" from her debut album Who Is Jill Scott?

&gt; In the late 70's, Ayers toured in Nigeria for six weeks with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, one of the Africa's most recognizable musicians. In 1980, Phonodisk released Music of Many Colors in Nigeria, featuring one side lead by Ayers' group and the other lead by Africa '70.

&gt; In 1981, Ayers produced an album with the singer Sylvia Striplin, Give Me Your Love (Uno Melodic Records, 1981). He has also worked in collaborations with soul songstress Erykah Badu.

&gt; Ayers performed a solo on John ""Jellybean"" Benitez's production of Whitney Houston's ""Love Will Save The Day"" from her second multi-platinum studio album Whitney. The single was released in July 1988 by Arista Records.

&gt; Ayers has played his live act for millions of people across the globe, including Japan, Australia, England and other parts of Europe.

&gt; Ayers is known for helping to popularize feel good music in the 70's, stating that ""I like that happy feeling all of the time, so that ingredient is still there. I try to generate that because it's the natural way I am"". The types of music that he used to do this consisted of funk, salsa, jazz, rock, soul and rap.

&gt; 1990s to present
In 1992, Ayers released two albums, Drive and Wake Up, for the hip-hop label Ichiban Records.

&gt; In 1992, Ayers collaborated with Rick James for an album and is quoted to have been a very close friend of his.

&gt; In 1993, Ayers appeared on the record Guru's Jazzmatazz Vol.1 featuring on the vibraphone in the song ""Take a Look (At Yourself)"".

&gt; In 1994, Ayers appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as ""Album of the Year"" by Time Magazine.

&gt; During the 2000s and 2010s, Ayers ventured into house music, collaborating with such stalwarts of the genre as Masters at Work and Kerri Chandler.

&gt; Ayers started two record labels, Uno Melodic and Gold Mink Records. The first released several LPs, including Sylvia Striplin's, while the second folded after a few singles.

&gt; In 2004, Ayers put out a collection of unreleased recordings called Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased recordings 1976‚Äì1981 which allowed fans to hear cuts that didn't make it onto the classic Polydor albums from his more popular years.

&gt; Roy Ayers hosts the fictitious radio station ""Fusion FM"" in Grand Theft Auto IV (2008).

&gt; In 2015, he appeared on Tyler, The Creator's new album Cherry Bomb on the track ""Find Your Wings"".

&gt; A documentary the Roy Ayers Project featuring Ayers and a number hip hop producers who have sampled his music and other people who have been influenced by him and his music has been in development for a number of years.

&gt; Pharrell Williams cites Roy Ayers as one of his key musical heroes.

&gt; Ayers is a recipient of the Congress of Racial Equality Lifetime Achievement Award.

&amp;#x200B;

A maior base dela √© dos progressistas, mas o Bernie Sanders j√° √© um nome bem mais reconhecido e com carisma maior que ela. Mesmo se o Bernie n√£o concorrer, ainda tem outros nomes progressistas com carisma maior que a Warren (apesar de serem menos conhecidos) como a Tulsi Gabbard.

&amp;#x200B;

Pra tentar ganhar as minorias que votaram no Obama nas primarias de 2008 ela vai ter v√°rios problemas, especialmente se algu√©m que faz parte de uma dessas minorias concorrer e isso √© bem prov√°vel. Nomes como Kamala Harris e Cory Booker s√£o constantemente especulados como poss√≠veis candidatos e o Julian Castro deve anunciar a candidatura dele agora em Janeiro. Mesmo se nenhum deles concorrer, ainda tem a possibilidade do Beto concorrer, e se ele conseguir ir bem, ele tem grande chance de ganhar o voto das minorias.

&amp;#x200B;

Finalmente, ela tamb√©m n√£o √© o melhor nome para o establishment democrata, que provavelmente vai querer ficar com algum nome conhecido, como o Joe Biden, ou pegar algum senador relativamente centrista sem sal como os j√° mencionados Cory Booker e Kamala Harris.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Pessoas como Beto O‚ÄôRourke se provaram *muito* potentes com eleitores de classe-m√©dia/alta suburbanos que tradicionalmente votavam republicano, mas que se chocaram com o governo Trump e o caminho que o partido tem tomado. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tem outros dois fatores que acho que ajudaram o Beto. O primeiro foi que o Cruz n√£o √© dos melhores candidatos. Mesmo sendo senador do Texas, um estado muito conservador, ele tem uma taxa de aprova√ß√£o baixa, provavelmente o Trump ajudou essa taxa a ficar baixa com os constantes ataques durante as primarias do partido republicano em 2016.

It got so bad that some of them threatened that, if they ever saw me IRL, they would attack me on the spot or follow me around with the smear campaign. Admittedly I didn't help my own cause because I continued to tell the jokes out of defiance, with the mindset of ""fuck these people, I joke about what I want"". Although I eventually publicly took responsibility for the jokes, apologized, left the place, and never looked back, they were still stalking my blog and sending me flames for a month after I left, so I still don't feel safe. Amazingly, the smear campaign never left that forum (to my knowledge, at least).

Depending on who starts and invites players to the squad we will get majority clans from those servers. 

If we play NA we will mostly get Lost, 1%, CDxx etc. 

If tristen or Ben start the squad (Asian players) we will get blue samurai, and a couple other clans I can‚Äôt translate. 

If Viking or WD40 (Europe) start the squad we get IMP, RU, Vice etc quite a bit.

When I play (I‚Äôm NA) - and we go with Ben or Tristen I noticeable lag, not so much for EU.

I‚Äôll tag Ben or Matt (the only V√òXers I know who have reddit) and they can confirm as well.

Many clans will play other servers to avoid Lost and 1% during NA peak times, and playing against top Asians squad is crazy because they play a super patient mech-out style with lots of splash and midrange.

**Article**:

&gt; In an exclusive interview set to air during Fox News&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All-American New Year&amp;apos; special Monday night,¬†President Trump suggested that only Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren&amp;apos;s ""psychiatrist"" knows whether she thinks she can win the White House in 2020.

&gt; Warren announced¬†Monday she is filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee for president,¬†becoming the first candidate to take the major step toward a 2020 run for the presidency.

&gt; Fox News&amp;apos; Pete Hegseth asked Trump whether Warren really thinks she could make him a one-term president.

&gt; ""Well, that I don&amp;apos;t know,"" Trump¬†responded.¬†""You‚Äôd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

&gt; CATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS&amp;apos; &amp;apos;ALL-AMERICAN NEW YEAR&amp;apos; SPECIAL, 10 PM ET

&gt; Warren, a liberal firebrand who rose to prominence during the 2008¬†financial crisis, angered many¬†top Democrats and Native American groups in October¬†by releasing inconclusive¬†DNA test¬†results in response to Trump&amp;apos;s claims that she repeatedly lied about her heritage to obtain affirmative-action benefits in the course of her academic career.

&gt; The Cherokee Nation responded to the¬†results at the time by asserting that ‚Äúa DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship.‚Äù And¬†Kim TallBear, an associate professor at the University of Alberta, remarked that Warren&amp;apos;s¬†""very desire to locate a claim to Native American identity in a DNA marker inherited from a long-ago ancestor is a settler-colonial racial understanding of what it is to be Native American.""

&gt; ""Elizabeth Warren will be the first,"" Trump told¬†Hegseth in the phone interview.¬†""She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn&amp;apos;t work out too well.""

&gt; According to Warren&amp;apos;s DNA analysis, ""the vast majority‚Äù of Warren‚Äôs family tree is European and there is ‚Äústrong evidence‚Äù she has Native-American ancestry ‚Äúin the range of 6-10 generations ago.‚Äù¬†As reported by the Boston Globe, this means she could be between 1/64 and 1/1,024 Native American.

&gt; ""I think you have more than she does, and maybe I do too, and I have nothing,"" Trump said, referring to tribal heritage. ""So, we‚Äôll see how she does.¬†I wish her well, I hope she does well, I‚Äôd love to run against her.""

&gt; Trump repeatedly has derided Warren for claiming she has Native American ancestry. At¬†a rally in July, he¬†joked that he would¬†pull out a heritage kit during a hypothetical presidential debate¬†with Warren and slowly toss it at her, ""hoping it doesn&amp;apos;t hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces.""

&gt; Separately, Trump again invited top Democrats to join him in Washington to resolve the ongoing partial federal government shutdown -- but he signaled that a border wall is an essential element of any deal.

&gt; The president speaks to Fox News.

&gt; One¬†bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown that has been floated among key senators is to provide¬†$5.7 billion in funding for the border wall, as well as a congressional reauthorization of the Obama-era¬†Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children, along with some other immigration provisions. There also has been talk about a special allowance for some classes of Central American refugees to be granted more robust asylum statuses.

&gt; ""I‚Äôm in Washington, I&amp;apos;m ready, willing and able. I&amp;apos;m in the White House, I&amp;apos;m ready to go,"" Trump said.¬†He added that Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi¬†and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ""can come over right now, they could&amp;apos;ve come over anytime.""

&gt; The president emphasized that he canceled his plans to spend Christmas and New Year&amp;apos;s Day at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida because of the partial shutdown, and signaled that he remains concerned about the approximately 800,000 federal workers who are affected by furloughs and understaffing.

&gt; ""I spent Christmas in the White House, I spent New Year‚Äôs Eve now in the White House,"" Trump said.¬†""And you know, I&amp;apos;m here, I‚Äôm ready to go. It&amp;apos;s very important. A lot of people are looking to get their paycheck, so I&amp;apos;m ready to go whenever they want.""

&gt; He added: ""No, we are not giving up. We have to have border security and the wall is a big part of border security. The biggest part.""

It's because no one knew what was going on there, some people thought they were doing it for no other reason; but the reason was simple: communism. The U.S. didn't want communism spread to other countries - or, hell, even the U.S. of A if people didn't care enough. The Vietnam War took place in the 60s-70s. During this time, stuff like the Hippie Revolution and Hippie music was happening. ""Hippie-ism"" is the idea of no war, and stuff, all leading to world peace. Springsteen wrote a song about it. ""Born in the U.S.A."" It's pretty good. But, in conclusion, the United States did not win the war, and neither did Vietnam. It was a stalemate. And there were horror stories returning to the U.S. too. Stories of Marines having children with prostitutes or citizens, and leaving them to die (like in *Miss Saigon*). World War II vets were treated nice because they knew what was going on in Europe, about the Holocaust, and that it was bad. The same type of communication wasn't happening. To sum it up: a lot of people thought the war was unneeded because no one won, and vets were bullied and beaten because of the stories about bui doi, and also horrible atrocities like My Lai Massacre.

See? Even KC has history, wrong history out count them all. Therefore I don't think it is a good excuse.

Of course I am not asking for 100% historical accuracy in a game. This is just a game. A game is meant to be fun. I agree some restriction is fine. But the restriction they imposed now is just bullshit.

Limit the amount of battleship deploy? Yep I am fine with that. Can only use Fuso and Yamashiro to kill the boss? Sorry. I have no interest in entertaining you Tanaka.

As I said, KC is now just a orgasm of Tanaka, who has no interest in making any improvement but to make the game more and more troublesome.

KC was a gem. But instead of turning it into a jewelry, Tanaka has grounded it down to sand.

Trades46,1536626507.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1wc3jbiy,False,"As someone who grew up in Hong Kong, moved to Canada and then going back to China for family gatherings, it was pretty eye-opening how different the car cultures are in their respective nations.

I have discussed similar things with my uncle there who previously operated used car dealerships &amp; independent garages in Guangdong province about this when I visited him a while back.

&gt;This is important because the Chinese have very different tastes in  automobiles. To simplify it, bigger is better. To get a sense of this, *Buick,* yes Buick, is a trendy brand in China

Generally u/comeonDeckard got the gist of it - in China, car buyers value COMFORT above everything else. The pseudo-sportiness that European brands like BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes brings generally do not sell cars in China. What is considered luxury in China is opposite of what Europeans &amp; Americans are used to - space to stretch out, a serenely quiet interior, technology (this is where Tesla may have a slight edge) and above all, a SOFT pillow-like ride.

This is why almost ALL models sold are locally manufactured (e.g. Brilliance-BMW, Chery-Jaguar, Beijing-Benz) usually have stretched Long wheel base (LWB) variants with extra legroom &amp; deliberately softened suspension &amp; uncharacteristically small (e.g. 16\~17in wheels as opposed to American/European market's 18\~20in) wheels + high-profile tires. Unsurprisingly the ""old men"" brands like Cadillac, Lincoln &amp; especially Buick which are shunned in America actually does quite well in China: when I visited Shanghai a good portion of the cars were the Excelle (think Buick's take on the Cruze), Verano, Regal, LaCrosse &amp; especially the GL8, a Buick luxury minivan.

Yes you heard that right - a Buick minivan. It is quite a popular vehicle there for chauffeurs for VIPs &amp; high ranking businessmen.

&gt;...Tesla sells to this odd little pseudo green niche. Specifically, for  Americans, the model 3 allows for conspicuous consumption while still  being seen as green and seen as cool.

This is a very good point. Americans always heavily associate with what they consume &amp; the image they portray. While this is more prominent in modern China (hence IPhone's popularity) this is not reflected in the ownership of cars. In Shanghai the most popular cars were still economy cars: Corollas/Civics along with cars like Jettas/Boras, Focus, Sylphy, Elantra etc. alongside their Chinese made equivalents (e.g. BYD F3, Roewe 360, Geely Emgrand, Trumpchi GA4 among others) are the cars of choice.

&gt;Another factor is that all luxury cars are really expensive. Both of these factors hollows out  the market in China for ""moderate luxury"" vehicles.

While you'll see a nice Maserati or Porsche occasionally, they are less frequent sightings again due to their price. Anything that is not locally produced (e.g. anything imported: from a 911, G-wagen to even mundane cars like Ford Explorer or Buick Enclave, the only Buick not manufactured in China) are prohibitively expensive.

This from what I understand is mainly from taxes &amp; import fees, which is why almost every automaker has a joint-plant in the nation, and why Tesla themselves are banging loudly about that Shanghai plant.

&gt;Also, there's no corresponding niche for the pseudo-eco validated consumption that exists in America. Instead, a big part of the China market will scoff at the cute and small Model 3.

Small sedans still do well in China (whereas the US sedan sales is just about toast), but even then the C-class, 3 series, XE, ATS etc. are all usually sold in LWB format. The simple fact of the matter is compact executive sedans while popular won't sell AT ALL if they do not possess enough room especially in the rear passenger compartment. This is one glaring problem I immediately noticed when I sat in a Model 3 in Canada: the rear passenger accommodation is atrocious. Ever wondered why the BMW 3 series from the E90 -&gt; F30 -&gt; G20 gotten considerably larger? Now you know why, and that's before considering Brilliance-BMW makes an even longer 320Li for China.

If Tesla actually talked to Chinese customers or gave a f\*\*k about actually selling cars there, the Model 3 without a doubt REQUIRES a LWB to be remotely viable for sales to happen, especially considering LR RWD variant has a  \~500,000RMB starting price which is obscene when you realize the 320Li costs \~350,000RMB and the domestic BYD Qin Pro EV500 (BEV version with \~62 kWh battery at \~310 miles NEDC range) starts at \~219,000RMB.

Another is Tesla's marketing. The Chinese frankly don't care about performance or 0-60 times; majority of cars sold in the nation have under 200hp engines &amp; large SUV rarely exceeding 300hp. I stress again COMFORT is the key to the Chinese market. That immediately brings down one of their biggest selling points in the US market, along with Superchargers being moot (China has already an established charging network + nationalized charging standard) and the American myth of Tesla being a ""pioneer in EV"" dead because the Chinese market is already being flooded with a huge number of choices of a ""New Energy vehicle"" from domestic automakers with numerous more coming down the line for 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I want to add to Deckard's comment in China is how Autopilot is going to be a death-trap in China. While in Canada &amp; US I have experienced unsavory drivers in metropolitan areas such as Toronto, NYC or Downtown LA, they have NOTHING on how the Chinese drive.

Drivers cutting others off is a common practice. Waiting to get out of intersections? Don't expect anyone to yield. On the expressway? Pretty much the same. Trying to rely on AP where it still has close calls in US in China is downright retarded, because frankly there are less painful ways to commit suicide.

While anecdotal, this [Autocar.uk](https://Autocar.uk) participation of ""Best car for China"" where judges pick out the best from the best-selling cars in the country. Notice none of the vehicles tested even are considered remotely ""sporty"" or ""fun to drive"", and the ranking system more heavily prioritizes ""seat comfort"" than ""acceleration"", which is telling how Chinese rates their vehicles. 

Performance simply isn't what Chinese car buyers look for.

Physically, I'm 6ft5 tall, pretty long beard, midback long hair, mostly black leather or denim clothing. Your typical metalhead/rocker dude. Also, I got a lot of obscure hobbies, and I live in a place where you literally have to import EVERYTHING. Also, luggage constraints are annoying. Only 25lbs for the carry-on, but they also allow an item like a purse or small backpack for free? Okay, those 8lbs of lead foil rolls went into the backpack then, along with everything else heavy. In the end that 'small item that has to fit under your seat' did prolly end up weighing around 50lbs, and since they don't weigh your 'personal item' and only your carry-on bag, it went unnoticed. Suspicious items get examined at the security checkpoint, though? Who'd have thought car ignition coils can look like hand grenades, huh? Not to mention there's the word 'ignition' in there, which is enough to make airport security jumpy. Add to that other 'unusual' items such as electronics prototype boards and parts, spools of magnet wire, thermal camera equipment, a good dozen of li-ion battery packs (each one below the maximum allowed size, mind you), several pounds of bismuth metal as well as a few bars of indium, some large graphite electrodes....

Then the whole bags get saran-wrapped. The saran wrap gets reinforced with several broad bands of heavy duty duct tape. And on either side of the bag the destination letters of the airport it's going to get taped in 5"" high letters. Baggage handlers and inspectors are people too, inspecting dozens of bags a day gets tedious and boring, and I bet you that if they can choose between some bag they only gotta unzip and one where they have to work through layers upon layers of packing 'security', they'll check the easy bags first.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/18/just-about-everything-youve-read-warren-dna-test-is-wrong/

&gt; Here‚Äôs where the reporting went off course. The report said that Warren had 10 times more Native American ancestry than the reference set from Utah, and 12 times more than the set from Britain. The report also said that the long segment on Chromosome 10 indicated that the DNA came from a relatively recent ancestor. ...

&gt; The most important point is this: The results in Warren‚Äôs DNA test are static. The percentage of Native American DNA in her genome does not shrink as you go back generations. There could be one individual in the sixth generation ‚Äî living around the mid-1800s, which is similar to Warren family lore ‚Äî or possibly a dozen or more ancestors back to the 10th generation, which would be about 250 years ago. Her results are consistent with a single ancestor, however. ...

&gt; This basic error in understanding the test results was compounded by the RNC‚Äôs reference to the 2014 New York Times article, which was about a genetic profile of the United States, based on a study of 160,000 people drawn from the customer base of 23andMe, a consumer personal genetics company. With reporters believing that Warren‚Äôs genome was only as little as 0.01 percent Native American*, the article‚Äôs line that ‚ÄúEuropean-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 Native American‚Äù made it appear as if Warren‚Äôs sample was even smaller than that of the average American. (*Note: an earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to the high end of range, 1.56 percent.)

And this was said when?

&gt; ...that isn't particularly true, if you are ignoring an entire continent.

Which is something you didn't mention at all, therefore I can hardly be blamed for not inferring it.

&gt; To give a quick list of African works worth checking out would be ""Mhudi"" by Sol Plaatje, or his adaptations of Shakespeare, ""Things fall apart"" by Chinua Achebe, literally anything by Wole Soyinka.

Or I could have mentioned *Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English* by Ken Saro-Wiwa, *In Corner B* by Es'kia Mphahlele, *Petals of Blood* by Ngugi wa Thiong'o, *Ways of Dying* by Zakes Mda, *The Bride Price* by Buchi Emecheta, and of course Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is now well-known. And since North Africa is also Africa (speaking of having blind spots), I could have mentioned The Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz, *The Yacoubian Building* by Alaa al-Aswany, and *Fugitive Light* by Mohammad Berrada.

&gt; or other works by White Africans.

You mean other white Africans like Nadine Gordimer, J. M. Coetzee, Athol Fugard, etc.?

The extensive list we've just compiled between us is the reason why I *didn't* mention these figures, because we've now blown way past my dozen-book limit. I don't want to overwhelm people with recommendations, so there has to be a stopping point somewhere. I chose a dozen, a good round number, and therefore I wasn't able to mention many works, several of which I considered before selecting something else.

&gt; Furthermore, whilst poorly worded by me, the other problem with your post is that you explicitly place African Diaspora as an exclusively ""American"" thing, see the distinction between South American and just ""American"".

I can't be responsible for your faulty inferences. The reason I said ""of the African diaspora"" is because Nella Larsen was and Percival Everett is African-American. That does not apply to Clarice Lispector (who was of Ukrainian descent) or Machado de Assis.

&gt; Like why not mention Haitians? Why not Jamaicans? or Black Brazilians? or Black Latinos in general?

For the obvious reason that none of them were authors of the books I was mentioning.

&gt; I mean the Asians you mention arent even that radical or different, an Indian and a Japanese person.

What a surprise: when choosing classic works to feature, I happen to select from a couple of countries with literary traditions going back for millennia. Do you evaluate the worth of books according to themselves, or by the country of origin of the authors?

&gt; In this regard your list isnt really a list of writers writing in a context outside of Europe and the US.

The reason why Canada and Norway are doing okay is because they were liberal democracies before oil became a thing.

I'm not looking for a realistic recreation of the US involvement in the Middle East after 9/11. I'm looking for more Ghost Recon. Maybe if it loosely took inspiration from that event, such as an attack on US soil that sparked a huge war. They could return to form and tie in a Splinter Cell game with the events of a new Ghost Recon and release a new update for R6:Siege that would further reflect the impact of the event. Perhaps even use the plot of The Division 2 to support the terrorist attack (if the plot is half decent). 

With that said, it'd be cool to see the **location set in two countries in Europe** as a new war has been waged there and instead of a rebel faction, it could be an allied or US army faction. This could further compliment the context of being called a Ghost as your team would operate away from the US army's direct involvement in the war, but still assist them under elite and covert operations behind enemy lines. As the game progresses, more US troops could be seen in new regions of the map as they begin to push the frontline backwards.

Furthermore, this would play well into the Ghost Recon lore as it could take place after the events of Future Soldier and involve the Russian Ultra nationalists as the antagonists. 

 Europe has a lot to offer in terms of environments and all the set pieces are already there from Future Soldier to include more challenging foes on the same level as the Ghosts.

WaturTribe,1525858966.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_xbgl4j4,False,"Now **this** is a wall of text. I will reply out of courtesy and also because I have been where you are right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I called it ""some religion"", is not to shy away from responsibility or something by obfuscating it. With my words, I meant to downplay its importance. I know that Christianity has had a profound impact on the lives of people in Western society and that partly through Christianity we managed to get so far ahead. I agree with you on the fact that today's Protestantism is far better than certain other religions, for the reasons you already wrote in your comment.

&amp;#x200B;

However, here is where I don't agree with you:

&gt;The religion of White Western countries was historically Protestantism: belief in Christ as the saviour; based on faith alone and without the sanctity of the Roman Catholic Church which is believed to be ""tainted""

&amp;#x200B;

This is only true for the period after the inception of Protestantism. **Before** that time Europe was largely still Catholic and rife with superstition. And how far back do you want to go? Before Christianity itself, the tribes in what is now called Europe had their own beliefs. So did the Greeks and the Romans. Before Christianity, the developed world already existed. Yet you seem to say in the rest of your comment that we ought to be content with (in my words: the most respectable version of) Christianity.

My friend, the reason we can converse, ask questions and talk freely is not solely because of Christianity. The renaissance and enlightenment periods have allowed us to shed the shackles of superstition. And be aware that not just the West has known periods of such developments.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, there was the Islamic Golden Age, when something other than war **did** happen in North Africa and the Middle East. You seem to ignore this in your comment. There are times, in any culture, when superstition is put on the back burner and critical thinking is allowed. That we live in places where this holds true today is something we should be very grateful for.

&amp;#x200B;

The crux of my comment is this: Why settle at Protestantism as the least corrupt and most benign religion? Why not take it a step further? Why not cut out all superstitious beliefs? Is that not the whole idea of this very subreddit? *Going your own way*. Now I don't mean that you should wallow in nihilism, as you cut out religion from your life. There are still many principles that can guide you. You may have very well chosen Protestantism as your guide and that's fine by me. Part of adhering to a narrative is that you should be expectant of critique every now and then. Such is life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whether you believe in ""religion"" (belief in the supernatural) or not, the mark of the beast will come soon enough: you'll be microchipped to buy and sell shit, and eventually just to live.

I have been a fanatical conspiracy theorist yearning for Jesus to come and save me at the end times. I could write you off as one and be done with it, but I believe that people can change. Only because of the patience and love of the people around me I am able to write these words in a calm and precise manner. I am able to think more critically than I ever did in my Christian days.

Yes, the ""mark of the beast"" is written about in old texts, but that does not mean it has to be true in any way. You only see a sliver of reality. You observe merely a part of the full picture and your fantasy filled brain fills in the rest. You think you have ""connected the dots"" and, truly, to the best of your internal measures you believe you are right. Please read the story of Percival Lowell, who, in his age came to the conclusion that the planet Mars had to have been inhabited by creatures who dug canals.

&amp;#x200B;

If you wish to talk further you can always send me a message. Cheers.

Maybe I'm not being clear. Yes, I beleive that companies should be owned by the employees rather than by a single person. This is even more important now as automation reduces the need for employees, thus broadening the steam of money to the company's profit line. I also beleive that all land should belong to the state. Profit made from working the land goes to the people working the land, but they cannot sell land or profit from unused land.

Neodimium60,1537218109.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_28dwc1nj,False,"Olha, todos os livros que eu li esse ano eu achei excelentes, mas acho que o melhor vai pro Silmarillion, principalmente o trecho da can√ß√£o dos Ainur. Li o Hobbit pela primeira vez e depois reli os outros tr√™s livros de O Senhor dos An√©is, assim como As Aventuras de Tom Bombadil e Outras Hist√≥rias. Tamb√©m li a tradu√ß√£o do Tolkien dos contos de Sigurd e Beowulf. Li a saga dos Volsungs ( vi muitas similaridades com os temas que aparecem nas obras do Tolkien). O segundo melhor livro que li nesse ano foi A Tale of Two Cities, de Charles Dickens, da √∫ltima vez que pesquisei sobre ele ainda n√£o tinha tradu√ß√£o mas deve sair em breve. Men√ß√£o honrosa para The Face of Another, do Kobo Abe.

&amp;#x200B;

Outros √≥timos livros foram:

* Contos Completos de Oscar Wilde: tinha lido na inf√¢ncia e foi excelente revisitar hist√≥rias t√£o tocantes, principalmente a do Pr√≠ncipe Feliz e a do Gigante Bondoso, que eu recomendo bastante;
* Negras Ra√≠zes do Haley foi uma √≥tima leitura (em ingl√™s, a tradu√ß√£o em portugu√™s deixou muito a desejar), mas eu descobri que uma parte da trama foi baseada em um livro chamado The African, de Harold Courlander, que eu planejo ler agora em 2019.

Peguei um conjunto de pe√ßas do Arist√≥fanes para ler tamb√©m:

* As Nuvens;
* S√≥ para mulheres;
* um Deus chamado dinheiro;
* Lis√≠strata.

Os mais longos foram livros de hist√≥ria:

* Os Romanov 1613-1918, do Simon Sebag Montefiore, uma obra s√≥lida sobre a ascens√£o e queda da fam√≠lia imperial russa, com poucos pontos baixos;
* As obras completas de Di√£o C√°ssio, edi√ß√£o Delphi Classics, o mais trabalhoso mas bastante recompensador ler a descri√ß√£o feita por romanos de eventos como as guerras civis que levaram √† instala√ß√£o de c√©sar, a revolta dos Iceni (liderada por Boudicca), o governo de Commodus entre outras.

Tem alguns quadrinhos que eu posso recomendar tamb√©m:

* Os dois volumes de Maus: j√° havia lido o primeiro volume em 2017 mas descobri que havia outro volume e corri para reler o primeiro e ent√£o pegar o segundo;
* O Perfuraneve, edi√ß√£o Aleph, que cont√©m os tr√™s volumes: O Perfuraneve, os Exploradores e A Travessia, que contam a hist√≥ria de um mundo congelado em que a √∫nica forma de sobreviv√™ncia √© em um trem .

No problem.

&gt; This is mirrored in the Labour Party too. A no-deal Brexit could cause a rupture in The Labour Party just as it will in The Tory Party

There's a divide, but it's pretty much strictly over leaving the EU itself, rather than over the policies that people want to see in a post-EU UK. The main opposition to leaving the EU is from the Blairite faction, who are basically trying to use it to drive a wedge into Corbyn's support, rather than due to any kind of principled position. There were large chunks of the 2017 manifesto (which is credited for Labour's current popularity) which are incompatible with EU rules, so while many of our voters disagree with leaving the EU, we're much more united in what we want to happen afterwards.

# The things that make fax *unreliable*:

* some idiot in the office dumped the faxes and took out the garbage before reading them. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/a4kzcu/nhs_told_to_ditch_absurd_fax_machines_the_nhs/ebgqn93/), cc: u/Deceptiveideas u/supermunchkin001)

# The things that make e-mail *unreliable*:

* the recipient's client tools decide incorrectly that the message is spam and stores the message where it will never be seen
* the receiving mail server uses a DNSBL to...
   * ..block connections from the sender
   * ..accept and blackhole messages from the sender
   * ..accept and deliver messages to a place that is never visited
* the recipient's mail service decides for any flawed reason that the message is spam and delivers it to a folder that will never be seen
* the recipient uses a `spamgourmet.com` address and forgot to update the counter thus causing the message to be blackholed or the service provider of the protected address blocks the spamgourmet.com server specifically
* recipient's mail server may reject the message if the domain name appearing in the `From:` field does not correspond with the IP address of the transmitting server (e.g. MUA allows freetyping the `From:` field and sender uses a `spamgourmet.com` address)
* the recipient uses a forwarding service like Namesilo, who refuses to forward messages from unrecognized senders because the forwarding service considers their own IP reputation more important than the actual delivery of a single message
* the recipient's mail server uses graylisting with unreasonable delay.  Time-sensitive messages can miss the deadline or sending servers can give up before the time lapse.
* recipient's e-mail server blocks the attachment (and possibly the whole email) incorrectly flagging it as malware.
* recipient's e-mail address is unknown because a webmaster's anti-spam effort...
   * ..is to not publish any email addresses.  Senders are forced to use a contact form that's blocked by a sometimes broken CAPTCHA.  And when the webform does work, PDF attachments are not possible.
   * ..is to block e-mail address disclosure until a CAPTCHA is solved, and the CAPTCHA is broken or the sender rejects the effort required
   * ..entails hiding e-mail addresses until some javascript renders them, but javascript is either unsupported or disabled by the visitor's secure browser.  There is also no indication to the visitor that an e-mail address is even available if j/s were to execute.
* recipient's e-mail address is unknown because the webpage publishing it blocks Tor and the visitor will be damned if they must give up their security to view the page
* the sender simply cannot send the message because the corporation who handles the recipient's email (e.g. is a PRISM corp like Google or Microsoft) is not sufficiently trustworthy for the content of the message
* large corporations use DNSBLs to force email senders to relay their mail through a static IP, and the sender with dynamic IP may not consider any third party sufficiently trustworthy to see *all* their emails
* sender boycotts the recipients e-mail provider
* recipient does not have an S/MIME cert. or PGP public key, thus failing to achieve the level of confidentiality required by the sender (some sys admins even refuse to accommodate encrypted e-mail in fear that a malicious payload will get past the organizations malware scanner)
* recipient uses an EU-based e-mail service provider, where law obligates collection of metadata (a collection that may jeopardize the level of confidentiality required by the sender), and the recipient or sender are not using a [Memory Hole](https://github.com/autocrypt/memoryhole)-capable MUA to protect their metadata
* recipient abandons their mailbox because they have other accounts and can't be bothered to manage all of them, and unread mail piles up
* sender is a technologically-challenged bank or brokerage who sends multipart MIME messages and puts in the plaintext part:
   * a message saying ""Upgrade your mail client"" instead of the actual message
   * a large dump of unreadable machine-generated HTML indistinguishable from garbage
* sender attaches a file in a non-standard proprietary format like MS Word and the recipient cannot view it (or does not trust it to open it for viewing).",True,False,False,,0,1546349867,,1546357269,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0f8wt,False,t3_a4kzcu,True,t1_ebgqn93,/r/technology/comments/a4kzcu/nhs_told_to_ditch_absurd_fax_machines_the_nhs/ed0f8wt/,,1550731446,3,True,False,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,

 Ciro Gomes, em entrevista em seu apartamento em Fortaleza - Jarbas Oliveira - 30.out.18 Para quem, como eu, tem o cora√ß√£o ligado na vida do povo, √© inevit√°vel a percep√ß√£o de que as esperan√ßas da maioria dos brasileiros se renovaram, em larga escala pelo encontro sazonal do in√≠cio de um novo ano com a posse de um novo governo. Essas energias, ainda que algo supersticiosas ou meramente psicol√≥gicas, n√£o s√£o est√©reis. Podem ajudar muito a construir coisas pr√°ticas na dire√ß√£o da sofrida agenda nacional.

 N√£o seria eu a botar areia nesse sentimento. Tor√ßo genuinamente que as coisas possam melhorar e at√© acho que melhorar√£o, ainda que modestamente.

 √â que pouco importam as fic√ß√µes de contagem do tempo t√£o necess√°rias √† nossa psicologia humana: o problema de partida em nosso pa√≠s √© objetivamente muito dif√≠cil e grave. A pol√≠tica pode produzir rupturas, reorienta√ß√µes, e rumos novos. Mas n√£o por si ou por qualquer fatalismo como o que deriva da mera troca de governo.

 √â preciso diagn√≥stico correto, terap√™utica bem administrada, equipe, disciplina, bons ventos exteriores, bom equil√≠brio entre autoridade e habilidade pol√≠ticas, senso de urg√™ncia e ...compromisso! Uma pitada de sorte √© sempre bem-vinda.

 Nessa conjun√ß√£o reside minha descren√ßa objetiva em grandes mudan√ßas. Alguns n√∫meros: quase [13 milh√µes de pessoas desempregadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/12/desemprego-em-novembro-cai-a-116-informa-ibge.shtml); 17 milh√µes de pessoas vivendo de bico na informalidade; 63 milh√µes de pessoas com nome sujo no SPC; endividamento empresarial recorde; d√©ficit p√∫blico de R$ 130 bilh√µes, d√≠vida p√∫blica superior R$ 5,2 trilh√µes, um quarto disso vencendo em poucos dias; 63,8 mil homic√≠dios nos √∫ltimos 12 meses; 60 mil estupros no mesmo per√≠odo; dengue, chikungunya, mal√°ria e sarampo epid√™micos e um grave problema de aten√ß√£o b√°sica de sa√∫de, agravado pela [sa√≠da dos m√©dicos estrangeiros](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/com-eleicao-de-bolsonaro-cuba-anuncia-fim-da-parceria-com-brasil-no-mais-medicos.shtml).

 Em resumo, esses s√£o alguns dos n√∫meros que desenham provavelmente a mais aguda crise socioecon√¥mica da hist√≥ria moderna do Brasil. Para qualquer um, a revers√£o desse quadro n√£o seria f√°cil. Para quem permitiu a percep√ß√£o simplificada ao extremo dos problemas e se deixou ver como capaz de resolver tudo a golpes de frases feitas ou de uma radicalizada ret√≥rica que mistura moralismo com ideologia estreita...Eis as raz√µes de meus temores.

 Realisticamente, para algu√©m com minha experi√™ncia, talvez a palavra correta em rela√ß√£o ao cen√°rio de 2019 seja uma grande interroga√ß√£o! Ningu√©m sabe, a meros momentos do in√≠cio efetivo do novo governo, o que vai ser. Nenhuma proposta concreta, nenhum di√°logo sistem√°tico com a intrincada federa√ß√£o politica do pa√≠s, e [os primeiros esc√¢ndalos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/fabricio-queiroz-diz-que-movimentacao-atipica-vem-de-comercio-de-carros.shtml) j√° t√™m o velho tratamento de antanho: ""Fiz, mas eles (PT) fizeram tamb√©m"". Familiares apontando potencial escandaloso tamb√©m √© hist√≥ria velha. Assim como a relativiza√ß√£o de valores com que se olham a si e aos advers√°rios.

 A equipe √©, para dizer o m√≠nimo, inexperiente. O mais importante assessor n√£o tem nem um dia sequer de viv√™ncia no setor p√∫blico. Outros... bem, h√° os que fraudam mapas para privilegiar interesses econ√¥micos e aqueles que j√° se apresentam com pr√°ticas question√°veis. O diagn√≥stico, travado por um liberalismo tosco, √©, para dizer pouco, equivocado.

 Depois de afundarmos na terap√™utica Dilma/Temer, alguma revers√£o √© de se esperar. Que venha, pois nosso povo precisa e merece. Mas o potencial de confus√£o, por essa mistura de graves problemas, grave incompet√™ncia e despreparo, equipe fraca e desconhecimento do pa√≠s me permite apostar mais na sorte...Que ela ajude nosso Brasil!

 Uma palavra sobre a oposi√ß√£o, neste quadro. √â preciso evitar o oportunismo rasteiro e demag√≥gico; atrair o governo para o jogo democr√°tico, for√ß√°-lo a atuar dentro da institucionalidade, oferecer alternativas pr√°ticas ao equ√≠vocos sem negar a complexidade dos problemas, muito menos explorar as muitas contradi√ß√µes derivadas da ret√≥rica tosca. A cada bobagem, uma proposta! E fiscalizar sem tr√©guas.

From your hostility and rudeness you obviously want an argument but I will try to keep this civil at least from my end.

First off Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson do not have influence disproportionate to their positions, they are both MPs and the reason they both have more influence than someone like Sajit Javid is because they have open opinions that resonate with lots of members of the public.

The reason I didn‚Äôt reference it was because I, again, was making a passing comment and could not be ‚Äúarsed‚Äù at the time to find the link.

Also as far as I know, 4 year led don‚Äôt twist the meaning of words, that seems a bit too complex for a 4 year old to do.

Everything not defined in these directives is left to the local authorities.

toastymow,1319777265.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_64s1v,False,"&gt; Why are they still allowed to operate? The churches should be shut down, 

Let me put it in simple terms: The Catholic Church is the world's biggest mafia. And I say that as a god-fearing Christian who went to a Catholic University and likes a lot of Catholic Theology. 

The Catholic Church is old, really old. They are one of the oldest institutions in existence. They are older than pretty much all the governments in Europe, certainly the governments in places like Australia. The Catholic Church is a COUNTRY. Its not just a Church. Vatican City has the ability to issue its own passports. They have embassies! Bureaucrats! Technically, they have a standing army, though the Swiss Guard are pretty much just a formality these days. Technically, the Swiss Guard do have guns though. The Catholic Church is fucking loaded too. They have all kinds of money. They (mostly) use it to do what they consider charity, and to be honest, its mostly good work. But the point is that they are fucking rich, and that alone gives them the kind of power that few institutions can rival. 

So members of the Catholic Church, and I'll be honest this probably goes all the way up to the fucking Pope (maybe not this Pope, but certainly a Pope in the last 60-70 years), have been involved in either the raping of children, boys or girls it really doesn't matter, or covering up the raping of a child by another priest. They have done this world-wide. Its a consistent pattern. They are serial enablers of serial abusers. They're an institution that, as part of its nature, harbors criminals and pedophiles. 

You look at ANY OTHER INSTITUTION and you say ""break it up. Jail the leaders, make an example of them."" You look at what we do to OTHER organizations that harbor pedophiles and enable the raping and sexual exploitation of CHILDREN and you know this is true. Because those organizations are usually called gangs, or human traffickers, or something awful like that. 

So really, there isn't a good solution. The typical method of going after such a large-scale organization in the United States is a RICO case. That's what they did to FIFA recently. But an attempt to RICO the Catholic Church is... it would be historic. It would be unheard of. And I have a feeling it would get peopled killed.

&gt; The intermediary‚Äôs role is that of a facilitator whose contacts, knowledge or even language skills might benefit sporting directors in this country or agents based overseas

&gt; I would typically spend the leadup to December putting out feelers to clubs or scouts, usually face-to-face at games, before supplying sporting directors with lists of options to pursue in the window. Simultaneously, I will have cultivated relationships with agents abroad to ascertain what their clients offer, securing written mandates to represent their players in negotiations in England or even with specific teams.

There's also a good breakdown of contract negotiations:

&gt; Take a scenario: it is 10am on transfer deadline day and a club, to whom I have already sent videos of a mandated player based abroad, belatedly decide they want to push through a deal before the 11pm cut-off. They will be aware of the player‚Äôs asking price so, as the intermediary, you have to assume that aspect of the move will not prove problematic. It is now a matter of securing the best contract possible in what time remains. So, having spoken at length with the player‚Äôs existing agent, I would fire off an email to the club ‚Äì it is essential it is in written form ‚Äì laying down the basic pay and, just as significantly, the bonus structure acceptable to the player.

&gt; Those bonuses can be incredibly intricate, and quite volatile. There are standard team clauses: the amount owed for winning the league, gaining promotion or avoiding relegation; for lifting the Champions League or qualifying for Europe. Then there is the potentially prickly issue of image rights, as well as personal incentives ‚Äì top scorer, goal or appearance bonuses ‚Äì and sums due for playing a certain number of games. Within that you might specify what constitutes an appearance: 45 minutes, an hour or even coming off the bench for a minute of stoppage time. If you are doing a deal for a club going for promotion you could seek a guarantee to raise the player‚Äôs salary in the new division. Likewise, you might accept a salary drop, or insert a release clause, in the event of relegation.

&gt; The demands are then emailed to the club, who could make amendments of their own. Once the deal is agreed in principle, you await the formal contract offer, usually drawn up by the club‚Äôs in-house solicitors and emailed over . That, too, has to be legalled at our end and there may be more to-ing and fro-ing over the finer details before, once the green light is given by both sides, you address the logistics of bringing the player over.",True,False,False,,0,1546354562,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0iihr,True,t3_abipcd,False,t3_abipcd,/r/soccer/comments/abipcd/a_football_agent_gives_an_insiders_account_on_the/ed0iihr/,,1550732953,12,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,

But hey, since you mention it... a white nation for the white race would be fantastic. Just like the Jews have a Jewish nation in Israel. The Native Americans have their own dependent sovereign tribal nations. Like essentially all other nations have a strong and rational interest in the preservation of their cultural, ethnic, and racial groups.

Only whites are forbidden from having this, with a concerted effort being made from the government level on down today to break up and dissolve any and all strong white majority areas. Countries, cities, communities, etc.

Flip that around and talk about whites mass migrating into another country, demanding the news be broadcast in English, that the voting system be offered in English and them allowed to vote, etc etc... and you'd hear screams of colonialism and cultural imperialism etc.

But talk about any other racial or ethnic group doing that exact same thing into ""white"" countries? You're told whites have no such thing, no right to it, and should REJOICE at being slowly replaced, made into a minority (despite us being told how terrible being a minority is for non-whites), and how we should put their interests, language, culture, values etc above our own etc.

It's absolutely ridiculous when you actually stop and honestly think about it, and take any of these situations and simply swap the race of the groups involved.

It's also why you see so much hatred for the few countries in Europe that have pushed back against the migrant invasion. Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, etc. Despite them enjoying their safety and peaceful societies while the rest of western Europe faces increased terrorism, social unrest, the looming collapse of their welfare states... their statements about how they must accept the ""new normal"" of constant unrest and threat of terrorist attacks etc.

We tore up the ABM treaty with Russia to put ABM systems in Europe and undermine their strategic deterrence.

1. Why do you want to study psychology?

2. Don‚Äôt choose a degree, a career, for the sake of someone else. Do it for you. If what you want is also what they want, great. If not, then that‚Äôs unfortunate, but you‚Äôre the one who has to get the degree and then go to work every day. 

3. Some things you can do postgraduate study in without needing undergrad. You can become a doctor with an MD, with any kind of undergrad degree. Some medical programs have prerequisite subjects, but looking at the big picture - medicine is something where you can get an unrelated degree first. 

4. What subjects are you good at in school? If you‚Äôre good at everything, don‚Äôt say that. Instead, think about what subjects you enjoy most, and what subjects are your best subjects. They may or may not be the same. What are they? 

5. In a psychology degree you will cover a bit of neuroscience (neuropsychology/anatomy/pharmacology/physiology etc.). 

6. A lot of the subjects you take in undergrad psychology mix science-art-philosophy. So you‚Äôll constantly be thinking about things in different ways and discussing ideas and linking concepts.

It's because of our national myth that everyone can be successful if they work hard and make the right choices.  Recently, it's become more difficult to be successful without a college degree, and our national myth has metastasized into ""everyone can get a college degree if they really want it.""  For example, my sister who teaches high school has told me that one of the explicit goals of her institution is to have every student go to college.

So I have students who are the first in their families to go to college, who have to work full-time to afford college, who are not academically prepared, and struggling with issues they have no control over.  A lot of my students don't know what the expectations are, and if I teach them with the approach you've outlined many more will fail.  And that's fine in Europe, where there are clearly delineated alternative careers, and no one goes bankrupt from paying medical bills.  But the U.S. economy is a Mordorian wasteland, and I'm trying to save everyone who can be saved.  So I do lots of hand-holding.  I email students if they don't show up to class for a few days in a row, I drop the lowest exam in 100-level courses, and I have rubrics for everything explicitly stating how points will be calculated.

&gt; Biography

&gt; 
Hayvanlar Alemi is a psychedelic folk rock band founded in Ankara. They got together in secondary school in 1999, when they were 14. Classical rock and heavy metal were big influences on teenagers in Ankara then, and they started their musical venture playing hard-and-heavy covers, but very soon self-discovered free improvisation and moved into a more avant-garde approach, and later on occasionally deployed traditional instruments, found-sound elements like live radio, and colorful stage theatrics. They were influenced by the new folk-infused experimental rock scene of the late 90s Istanbul, but isolated from any music scene in Ankara, their sound and song-structure diverged from their contemporaries as they incorporated elements from the findings of their musical research into their sound, which included folk, pop and hybrid sounds of South East Asia, East and West Africa, South America and Russia, as well as Jamaican dub reggae and Californian surf.

&gt; Having begun self-releasing cdrs in 2004, Hayvanlar Alemi released their first album ‚ÄúGaga‚Äù through Ankara label 003 Records in 2006. Their second album ‚ÄúGuarana Superpower‚Äù, mostly culled from tracks on their cdrs from 2007 to 2009, was released by Seattle label Sublime Frequencies in 2010, followed by a cover of Mulatu Astatke‚Äôs Ethiopian instrumental piece ‚ÄúYekermo Sew‚Äù on seven inch vinyl. Following the release of Guarana Superpower which received positive reviews from publications such as The Guardian, Uncut and Wire, Hayvanlar Alemi opened for Group Doueh in London‚Äôs Barbican Centre and played a surprise performance at All Tomorrow‚Äôs Parties Festival Curated by Animal Collective. Since then they have been touring routinely and presenting their music to live audiences in Western Europe.  The band's third official album ""Twisted Souvenirs"", which was recorded in 2011 and 2012,  come out on vinyl on German label Unrock on 2014  and in early 2015 as a digital download on Inverted Spectrum Records, a Bandcamp label managed by the band's drummer.

&gt; Hayvanlar Alemi consists of √ñz√ºm ƒ∞tez, I≈üƒ±k Sarƒ±han, Hazar Mutgan and G√∂k√ße Ba≈üar. As they have been separated by geographical boundaries since 2006, the band has a flexible repertoire which allows them to play in power-duo and power-trio formations as well. In the past few years, Hayvanlar Alemi mostly toured with an old-school three piece set up with drums (Sarƒ±han), bass (Mutgan) and electric guitar (ƒ∞tez), with an emphasis on heavy psychedelic rock.  Band's name translates to English as ""Animal Kingdom"". Outside music,  band members  work in the fields of architecture, engineering, physics and philosophy.

You captured Scarlet's essence well although I was hoping for one mad screenshot of her [""laughing her leaves off""](https://youtu.be/LklhISETDJU?t=27) just to sell home Scarlet's creative insanity (not that we could ever forget her mentioning Faren's ""fancy panties"" and taking a liking to him when we rescued poor scantily clad Faren from Scarlet's cauldron in DR). In fact, those caps reminded me of this fun [player idea for a screenshot](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/147863/gw046.jpg) from the old GW2 forums depicting Scarlet and Trahearne chatting (as much as I oppose what Scarlet says there, the idea itself still makes me smile imagining what the actual interactions between Firstborn brother and Secondborn sister might've been like). ;)

I always found [Scarlet's history with the Inquest among other factions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Short_Story:_What_Scarlet_Saw) fascinating, and her being one of the influences goading the Inquest to cause the infamous Thaumanova reactor disaster was a nice tie-in to explain those mysterious occurrences back in the day as it advanced Scarlet's research on dragon energy, chaos magic and ley lines and gave us clues what she would ultimately be after.

It would be interesting if we ran into Scarlet's ghost in the Mists one day to give Taimi's arc some closure (given how big a Scarlet fangirl she was when introduced in Season 1, and how Taimi'd react to meeting her former ""idol"") and show Scarlet as the sociopath she awakened as but this time without Mordremoth influencing her actions and her maybe willing to use her brainpower to help us with our current Mists predicament to save Tyria (she may be a mad genius, but she wouldn't want her grand experiment to see Tyria evolve end with the destruction of all reality). Even better if we also met the ghost of Scarlet's mentor Omadd and saw some reconciliation between them, with Scarlet maybe apologizing for killing him while under Mordy's influence. After all, she seemed to regret her actions in S1 if using Omadd's name as a password for her encrypted files, having a torn portrait of Omadd in her lair, and her reacting angrily to Kasmeer calling her Ceara (as Omadd had done before Ceara had returned from the machine adopting the persona of Scarlet) during the final battle were any indication. :)",True,False,False,,0,1546363345,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0rdz0,False,t3_abex6r,True,t3_abex6r,/r/Guildwars2/comments/abex6r/local_sylvari_joins_the_inquest_and_disappoints/ed0rdz0/,,1550737104,1,True,False,Guildwars2,t5_2r9po,r/Guildwars2,public,
rieslingatkos,1457137143.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_w58ip,False,"&gt; *Nuclear power guarantees unlimited range, with a submarine‚Äôs only limiting factors being food and crew morale. The ability to speed across the Pacific or Atlantic directly into action, without needing to stop and refuel, is a powerful capability.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *There are other advantages. Nuclear submarines can be considerably larger than diesel electric boats and thus fitted with more non-attack capabilities (unmanned undersea vehicles, spy gear, or room for combat divers and SEALs). That's because no matter how big the sub gets, it doesn't have to take on proportionately large amounts of voluminous liquid fuel. Nuclear submarines also can stay submerged for very long periods of time, although the new generation of diesel electric submarines can stay submerged longer than ever before.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *One of the problems with non-nuclear subs is the need to rely on bases. Although few people talk about it, the fact is that in the event of a real war with China, every major military base from Okinawa to Guam will be bombarded with conventionally-armed ballistic missiles. Their goal: to destroy the springboards of American power into China‚Äôs backyard, pushing the Americans all the way back to Hawaii. Some missiles would get shot down, but others will get through. (This isn‚Äôt just limited to a war with China. You could overlay the same scenario over Europe with a hypothetical conflict with Russia.)*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Thus, in the event of war with China, it is quite likely that non-nuclear American submarines would lose their forward bases‚Äîwhich was the point of building them in the first place. The nearest places they could rearm and refuel would probably be Australia and Hawaii. A diesel boat with a burning Yokosuka naval base in its periscope and a quarter tank of diesel fuel is going to be in a lot of trouble. A nuclear-powered boat is not. In the event of a surprise attack by a major adversary, America‚Äôs forward-deployed nuclear-powered submarine fleet may be the only ships that survive the first day of war.*

I take very much issue with that. ""Stalin's"" theory of uneven development was just as much known to Trotsky as it was to Lenin. Stalin distorted this law by his attempt to justify something with it can't be justified with it: the reactionary theory of socialism in one country. 

Trotsky on the other hand was not only well-acquainted with the law of ""uneven"" development but also with another law derived from it: the law of combined development. His theory of permanent revolution is based on this understanding of ""uneven and combined development"". As yet another Chinese Trotskyist explained:

&gt; ""Trotsky‚Äôs theory of permanent revolution is inseparable from his ‚Äòlaw of combined development‚Äô. Lenin discovered the ‚Äòlaw of uneven development‚Äô and used it to explain a great many things. Trotsky invented his ‚Äòlaw of combined development‚Äô on the foundations of Lenin‚Äôs discovery, and used it to explain even more things. Trotsky‚Äôs law showed that a large number of so-called ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô periods in history are not simply ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô but constitute social systems in their own right. Past and future forms of development ‚Äòcombine‚Äô their special characteristics and so develop into a system. For example, the system of ‚Äòautocratism‚Äô in modern European history produced by the ‚Äòcombination‚Äô of certain special features of capitalism with others of feudalism can endure for a comparatively long time and sustain its own special politics, culture, and thought. ‚ÄòTsarism‚Äô, the system that ruled Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was not only ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô but formed a rather integrated system in its own right, its special characteristic being that capitalism controlled the state by making use of feudal exploitation and feudal methods of rule. It‚Äôs precisely because capitalism and feudalism developed in combination that the Russian Revolution could not first topple and expropriate the feudal system of ownership but had simultaneously to topple and expropriate the capitalist system of ownership. Many historical and practical problems are easily solved using Trotsky‚Äôs law of combined development.""

* Zheng Chaolin


Otherwise I think it is a a fair summary with only one other minor error: 

&gt; Trotsky classified the Soviet Union as a ""degenerated workers state"" and the Soviet Communist Party as ""bureaucratic centralist,"" also declaring the death of the 3rd international, and beginning the 4th international. 

The chronology is not quite clear here. When Trotsky still considered the Soviet Union ""bureaucratic centrist"" he did not call for a political revolution. Back then his slogan was: ""not revolution but reform"". It was only the experience of the tragic events in Germany 1933 where the German Communist Party enabled Hitler to come to power without a fight due to Stalin's idiotic theory of ""social fascism"". More precisely, it was the inability of the Communist International to do proper self-criticism that convinced him that the USSR was unreformable, and only then did he propose to build a new international. 

Edit: Oh yeah, this part here is also rather confused: 

&gt; ...and the idea that a communist society will be a 'workers' democracy.'

Workers' democracy will come before communism. It is essential for socialist construction. Under communism itself there will be no class of wage workers. Communism, and this includes both of its stages, will be a classless society. Hence this sentence doesn't make much sense.

Also:

&gt; ...another revolution of the workers was necessary to unseat the ""Stalinist"" bureaucracy...

Here I would stress that this revolution is a political and not a social revolution. To quote form Andy Blunden's excellent study of Stalinism:

&gt; Political revolution means the overthrow of the bureaucracy, whilst retaining the state as a weapon against imperialism and capitalist restoration. Political revolution means the independent mobilisation of the working class with a program aimed at the working class regaining political control of the state, and thereby the economy.

&gt;Political revolution was the perspective of the Trotskyist movement from 1933 on, once Trotsky came to the conclusion that regeneration of the Communist Party was no longer possible. Political revolution means the revolutionary overthrow of the Stalinist regime in the USSR. This revolutionary strategy is distinguished from social revolution only because it does not entail expropriation of the private property in the means of production, which had already been carried out (and at the moment of writing, has still not been entirely obliterated).

&gt;Further, such a political revolution does not actually entail the passage of power from one class to another, but simply the taking of political power by the working class from a bureaucracy which has usurped political power from the workers. There was no capitalist class with a social base in private ownership in the means of production in the USSR.

&gt;While the bureaucracy appears before the workers of their own country as no better than any capitalist class, the Soviet state was a force outside of the actual control of imperialism. So long as the growth of the market in the USSR was contained, the USSR remained unquestionably a gain of the working class that had to be defended against the attempt of imperialism to restore capitalism and/or overthrow the state. The perspective of political revolution combined the perspective of overthrowing the bureaucracy with that of defending nationalised property.

Overall Canada, like many European countries, is one of the best places to live in the world.

We don't have as many extremely high paying financial opportunities as some other countries like America, but we also don't have major problems with illiteracy, poverty, crime rate, expensive education and healthcare as some other countries like America.

Our health care is pretty good, I don't personally know anyone who has been screwed over financially by it. I know a handful of people who have gotten botched procedures though, apparently it's more common than it should be, but I don't think its an epidemic. Most good employers will give you nice benefit packages with dental, vision, disability, etc.

People here are polite and friendly, and mostly tend to ""do the right thing"". But they also tend to be more cold than you may be used to. People are less personal, and don't like to be touched as much here as some other countries, such as cheek kissing, hugs, and physical contact during conversations. If you ask for help, you will probably get it, but if you try to get personal, people may become uncomfortable.

Work varies a lot depending on your field, but Canadians do tend to work consistently more than most first world countries. We only have 2 weeks minimum paid vacation, 10 ish statutory vacation days, and most of us work 40 hour weeks. People tend to form close bonds at work and this will probably be where you make most of your friends. For me in tech, I really enjoy the work environment, free food all the time, flexible hours, ability to work from home, every other Friday off, etc. Salaries are all around pretty good for all fields, careers like Police or Teacher tend to pay well here vs places like America, but high end careers like Software Engineer or Doctor, pay more elsewhere.

Buying in a lot of places is very expensive. Getting a place worth around 5x your gross annual salary is probably what most people will do. As someone who is frugal, I thought it was pretty easy. As a side note, North Americans tend to have the lowest rate of savings in the world.
I bought my place at 24 in a big city metro area with a modest paying job, so it's definitely doable.
Note that Montreal is much cheaper than other big city areas.

Politics are politics, we are pretty liberal / left leaning as far as the world overall goes. Our politicians aren't really any different than you would get anywhere else, depends who is in on the podium at the time.

Mas.... ent√£o posso ou n√£o posso experimentar o gin√°sio? Pelos vistos pude.... Eu n√£o treinei la em Dezembro (nem podia aparentemente, visto que o contrato so come√ßava em Janeiro). Eu nem lhe disse se queria comecar em Janeiro ou Dezembro, ou se queria comecar sequer.... N√£o lhe disse nada. 

Nem enganei ninguem porque nem sequer estava a espera que ele j√° n√£o estivesse l√° quando sa√≠.... Se ele estivesse eu tinha dito ""olha muito obrigado mas n√£o quero porque s√≥ tens um banco de supino e um plataforma de deadlift e em dias em que isto estiver cheio demoro 3 horas a treinar"".

For one example, take a Classical Era Southern Europe (around the time of the Punic Wars), then have it criss-crossed by a continent-spanning system of underground railway stations. Another example, a little more ""out there"" as it leans into alternate history, could be in an alternate Islamic Golden Age where Rome never rose to prominence, and advanced alchemical transmutation is enabled by the cultivation of mysterious self-replicating substances that might have come to Earth by way of a meteor shower.

In regards to your questions:

You can choose between a bunch of prepaid sim providers (I've used Masmovil, Lycamobile and others) where you get at least something around 4-8gb for 10-20‚Ç¨ per month which should be totally sufficient for everyday use assuming you have wifi at your place. Most also include unlimited calls.

No need to turn data off at any point.

Using the sim card in other countries: This depends on where you travel. If you travel inside the EU, you can use roaming (all of your data and calls) free of charge! Travelling outside the EU I would either not use roaming at all or just get a simcard in that country as well.

All_Gonna_Make_It,1380478987.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_dbq4r,False,"&gt;Automation is THE solution to the human condition

Wishful thinking imo. When automation is widespread enough, corporation will have ALL the power. A company like  Facebook will say ""The US wants a crazy tax hike on big business so that OUR profits fund the citizens?"" and then they will find a country with a more favorable tax structure. Countries- especially developing ones like those in Africa- will bend over backwards for corporations. Corporations would only remain in a UBI country if they gained more power in exchange for the higher taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

So 20 years from now, I can only see two outcomes:

1) Business is driven out of the West due to high taxes. The population is out of work and out of money, without a way to get either. Corrupt leaders in developing countries have seen business movement as an opportunity to grow their country's economy by offering extremely low tax rates to corporations at the expense of their own citizens. The US, Canada, and much of Europe are now trending towards peasant.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Corporations agree to pay more in taxes to fun UBI in exchange for more power. Now Amazon and Facebook have a monopoly on all of your personal information, run government, or own the country's resources and infrastructure.

The truth is, I have recently unveiled a shocking truth that goes back centuries. In short, the Dutch are planning to conquer the world with the power of Christmas. The origins of this conspiracy go back to the mid 17th century. After gaining independence in the eighty years war from the Spanish the Netherlands established itself relatively quickly as a power in Europe. However, they were never taken seriously and mocked for their wooden shoes by the rest of Europe. This, in turn, angered the Dutch who started to plot the fall of all nations who mocked them. This is how they created ""Sinterklaas"" The Dutch Santa, and the figure from which St. Nicholas is derived from. I know, I know this may come as a shock but it is true my friends. You may say that evidence of such beliefs were found even earlier in the 1500s, but there is yet another answer for this. You see in the year 2023, the Dutch government hired the services of their most trusted and skilled mercenary,  Jean-Claude Van Damme to travel back in time and create the legends of Sinterklaas to the Dutch people. You may now ask, how will the Dutch use Santa and  Jean-Claude Van Damme to destroy the planet? The answer is simple, every Christmas night, children will hope for gifts under the Christmas tree, but when the plan starts, they will instead find tulips, wooden shoes and even body pillows of  Jean-Claude Van Damme. And when the children inevitably put on their wooden shoes, they will become Dutch! And join the conspiracy to obliterate the planet for mocking them for being defeated by tulips. With an uncountable amount of children, panic will ensue throughout the world and the Dutch will use this to their advantage and conquer the world with the combined magic of Santa and the sheer power of  Jean-Claude Van Damme!

My guess would be that among other factors, the religion and culture part is really important and affected the advancements in science and hindered the countries in becoming industrial. The fact that there was no separation between the Church and the Government is another thing. Availability of natural resources (particularly metals ores and coal/petrol) and the infrastructure to utilize them also probably lacked in many countries, at least, they were not discovered at the time. 

As an interesting piece of information, I have seen somewhere, maybe in a documentary? that the Tsetse fly in Africa is actually a factor why Africa in general is underdeveloped (not applicable to the desert areas)- the disease spread by those flies decimate through cattle population, and so cattle cannot be used for farming as extensively as we were able to use cattle or horses in Europe, especially after creating metal tools (plows? I do not know the english word). This prevented people from being able to farm more effectively, and combined with the harsher climate, it made it very very difficult to farm enough to be able to have enough food supplies from a season to another, also leading to underfed population and then a whole load of other issues related to that.

WiseauWonderShow,1483137502.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1403b6,False,"I'll give you the point about ""it's in the name."" That's very true that names can be used to try and lead a narrative or agenda, I'll concede that absolutely. That being said, the antifascist movement globally has been pretty consistent with its name in the work that they've done. In Greece, where I'm a citizen, Antifa actually successfully repelled the Golden Dawn party from Crete almost entirely through direct action and protest. The Golden Dawn Party being the far right party that closely mirrors the ideologies of the military dictatorship from the early part of the 20th century as well as having similar politics as the military junta that ruled the country from the 60's to the 70's and have very Nazi like beliefs. In France the Antifa movement there has been active alongside the leftist contingency of the yellow vests in seeking an end to neoliberal taxation policies that undermine the poor/working class, and in Portugal the yellow vests and Antifa have been protesting corruption and similar anti worker policies to great success. So that being said, in this case I'm very comfortable with using the ""it's in the name"" argument since across the globe Antifa had proven to consistently be a left wing syndicalism group dedicated to fighting fascism and neoliberalism (which at this point is comfortably fascist-adjacent). 

In most cases Antifa shows up as a counter protesting force, not actually instigators of violence.

I really want an answer of what would happen if you didn't make any unnecessary assumptions, and you just had a large mass of bodies colliding with Europe. I know there would be cataclysmic consequences- probably some kind of wave like a rock dropping into water- and perhaps one of these waves might be enough to throw some Chinese people into space. Perhaps when two waves circle the Earth, they will constructively interfere and *that* wave will be enough to throw some Chinese people into orbit. I don't know enough about fluid mechanics to say.

However, I do know that Force = mass * acceleration. I found [this article](https://www.quora.com/How-much-force-is-required-to-make-a-10-kg-mass-object-go-to-space-or-put-it-in-an-orbit-around-the-Earth) that says it takes 50 kiloNewtons of force to get a 10 kg object into space. I'm going to assume this scales linearly. (50 kN / 10 kg) * (70 kg / person) * 1.4 billion people = 4.9 √ó 10^14 newtons (if I did the math right).

Now I need to produce 4.9 quadrillion newtons of force at the other end of this perfect continental see-saw. [According to this calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/force.php?given_data=mass&amp;f=490000000000000&amp;f_units=newton&amp;m_units=kilogram&amp;a=9.8&amp;a_units=meter+per+second+squared&amp;sf=6&amp;given_data_last=mass&amp;action=solve) I need 50,000,000,000,000 kg of weight to do this. Divide that by 70 kg per person, and you get 714,000,000,000 people.

So I'm going with that.

HARUTO-TONBOGIRI,1539393741.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2eg81o6y,False,"Depends on the god, I suppose. They can range from cold, stoic, and calculating, to cheerful, ditzy, and a bit absentminded. When I was messing around with Shinto/Buddhist gods, I sat down and did a lot of research into Izanami-no-Mikoto, the Japanese primordial goddess of death and creation. Once I got a feel for her general story in the mythology, I worked out how I would reiterate her in my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

What came out was a woman who was incredibly cheerful, eager to help others get out of their slump, and always willing to lend a listening ear. She's a bit scatterbrained and has a difficult time adjusting herself to modern, human society, since the country is so different than it was hundreds of years ago. She's by far the sweetest character in the story, but as one of the oldest surviving goddesses, she holds a lot of secrets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Centuries before the main character would meet her, Izanami was a very different woman, to the point that her fellow gods dubbed her 'Izanami the Cruel'. She was said to be hateful, baleful mass murderer. She repeatedly broke Heaven's laws and ordinances, but no one could ever punish her for it. No one had the strength to kill her, and then there was the question of who would take her place as the goddess of death if they did win against her. No one wanted that job. Constantly being able to get away with breaking the rules only made her fellow deities hate her more. It's later revealed why and how she ended up like that, and it mostly plays off of Shinto mythology.

&amp;#x200B;

Izanami had her dream life when she was with Izanagi and all of her children, before the age of Man. She was a natural home-maker and wanted to keep building up her family. She ""died"" giving birth to Kagutsuchi, despite her family's best attempts to keep her alive in her charred, almost skeletal state. After she passed, she awoke in the Underworld as a rotten corpse, which led to the classic scene of Izanagi running away from her in Yomi. Years later, she was saved by Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, who fixed her appearance up a little bit, but were unable to rid her of her wintry, pallid skin. When she set foot in the world of the living once more, Izanami saw how much had changed since her death. Her daughter, Mizuhame died in a failed attempt to rescue her from Yomi. Kagutsuchi was alive, but was sealed inside of the sun. Izanagi fell into a languid torpor after his attempt to save his wife, and died an absentminded mute. Izanami's surviving children had grown up and split into two factions. The first were those that sided with Amaterasu and wanted to establish themselves as a pantheon, or a sovereign state of gods. The other faction, led by Susanoo, wanted to make a combined effort to search for their mother and father.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time Izanami came back, those two factions had already warred with each other. Those that were opposed to the formation of a divine state were wiped out almost entirely. Those that sided with Amaterasu were far more preoccupied with ruling over mankind and facilitating the birth of new deities than with preserving the original family. Though Amaterasu and Izanami cooperated to elevate the pantheon, it was pretty clear that the latter held a deadly grudge for the former. But with the pantheon still in its early stages, and Izanami all but alone on the ideological side of things, the two needed each other. Her title as 'Izanami the Cruel' came after she started The Black Death that swept across Europe. Supposedly, it was revenge on the Catholic church after they found Kagutsuchi, branded her a witch (it's a her in this story), and burned her alive.

&amp;#x200B;

So, though Izanami ended up being one of the nicest and sweetest characters in the story, she has a complex past where she was anything but. She made a habit out of fighting cruelty with brutal vengeance and didn't care how many people would die in the crossfire. It took a lot before she was able to confront herself, let go of her pain, and change into a loving, inviting woman. I suppose the deities I write aren't always that different from humans, really. Perhaps their emotions can be taken to extremes because they have the magical powers to act on them. But some of them feel love, hatred, and pain in a similar fashion to humans.

alanquinne,1502333478.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9zf7gxi,False,"They forgot the part that about the Russian monarchy being the most reactionary monarchy in Europe, having stalled Russia's development for decades, so much so that Russia was the most backwards power among the major European countries, centuries behind the others in even basic political and constitutional reforms, and the tsar's obstinate hostility and opposition to acquiescing towards a constitutional monarchy (which he constantly sabotaged and sidestepped) was one of the principle reasons that they were devastated in WWI, and the humiliating loss to imperial Japan in 1905 (which nearly collapsed tsarism then and resulted in a failed uprising, it was held together only by severe repression). In contrast, constitutional monarchies in Britain, Japan, and Germany played a relatively progressive part and *spurred* economic and social development in their countries, while Russia lagged behind. 

An interesting side note, the first modern proto-fascism movement emerged not in Germany, but in tsarist Russia. Viciously anti-semitic, Russo-chauvinistic, pro-absolutist monarchist right-wing populists were thriving in Russia pre-WWI, and often rivalled or exceeded the popularity of the left. Among other things, when they weren't printing pieces like *The Elders of Zion*, or carrying out pogroms, they were desperately trying to prevent any transition  to a western-style liberal constitutional monarchy, believing that the tsar had a 'mystical bond with the people' that had to be maintained and could not be mediated by anyone, much less a parliament. There were even highly competent tsarist government officials (Witte, Stolypin, Durnovo) who desperately wanted to carry out modernizing reforms (in the interest of preventing collapse, and maintaining stability), and it was these people who actually saved the tsarist system from the brink in 1905. And yet 12 years it all went down in ruin, because Nicholas II was a feckless imbecile who was so reactionary, that he refused to mobilize or incorporate the proto-fascist legion of supporters who would have thrown their lives away had he merely asked, because it contravened the principle of 'absolutely autocracy',  and he refused to heed the advice of those competent officials who were still trying to save him. Simply put, he didn't want to be saved. By late 1916, Lenin had lost all hope (he was in exile, and thus didn't have an accurate picture of the events in Russia), and told a group of students that the revolution might never happen, meanwhile, the tsar's own secret police analysts were warning that a revolution was imminent because of how badly the tsarist government had bungled the food supply. Durnovo had predicted some years earlier, in a notorious memorandum to Nicholas II, that a war with highly advanced Germany would almost certainly expose the weaknesses of the tsarist system, and precipitate a social revolution that would end his rule. Durnovo's prescient letter was of course ignored and dismissed.

1917 came around, and suddenly, no one, absolutely no one, not the left wing, not the liberals, not the rabid right wing, not his generals, not his own government officials, absolutely no one, retained any sympathy or loyalty for him, and he was forced to abdicate. Everyone had become completely disillusioned with him. 

That's how backwards and uniquely archaic the Russian monarchy was.

In contrast, Stalin's USSR would rise no more than a generation later from the chaos of the tsarist collapse, WWI, and the Russian Civil War, become a great power, and not only avenge the losses, but avenge them decisively against a Germany and a Japan that were more powerful than they had been in 1905 and 1917 when they originally trounced Russia.

People been repeating this since 1990 when Soviet collapsed. Even as recently as 2014, people saying ""Hard Landing"" for China's economy.

&amp;#x200B;

A broken clock is right twice-a-day, so keep up the baseless predictions that's been consistently proven wrong over and over again.

&gt; They have a massive housing crisis that makes before 2008 look small. 

This has been repeated for years and years since 2014 about a ""hard-landing"" and a ""housing bubble"", this has been thoroughly disproven over and over again.

&gt; And with the one child policy, it means one couple is taking care of two sets of parents and four sets of grandparents as they get older. That, and their population will soon start dropping, which means a slower economy 

You will be hard pressed to convince me that 2 billion population (without One Child Policy) is more advantageous to China's long-term sustainable growth than with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me, without One Child Policy, how would having a 1.8 Billion population be better for China? Ever heard of ""Overpopulation""??

&gt; Its more likely that china will collapse in the next 50 years than become the next super power. 

Wishful non-thinking. China is merely copying the proven export-oriented model of Japan, Korea, Taiwan.  It's a proven model for economic success that's been pioneered by other East Asian nations, Europeans, and American.

&amp;#x200B;

In 50 years, China will be the world's largest economy and likely the leader of the world.

A country can filter foreign betting websites pretty easily, and stop the 90% of people from betting, especially the vulnerable people tricked into spending their salaries in a rigged game.

Internet banning is *technically* easy, but there are numerous downsides:

* you're introducing domain banning as a legal concept, which many people are scared of as it can even more easily be diverted to ban political opposition or other sites critical of the government, porn, Youtube, Wikipedia, ...
* the cheap forms (domain-blocking on DNS level, IP range banning) are easily subverted. DNS blocking only requires changing your router to Google DNS (which many people already do!), IP-range banning is circumvented by gambling sites going on big Cloud IP ranges where blocking introduces huge collateral damage. Intercepting DNS requests to Google requires expensive equipment and won't work once DNSSEC and DNS-over-secure-channel is fully rolled out
* seizing domains only works for local gambling sites, it's much harder to seize .com, .eu or other domains

Want to stop gambling? Fight the causes of the *demand* for gambling, which in very many gambling cases (at least those I know of) are a lack of jobs, a lack of life perspective, and a lack of a decent social support system. Don't fuck around with the Internet, it won't work unless you're China or North Korea anyway.

Tattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of √ñtzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites, including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines and the Andes. These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt (c.

In my country, for example, you have to finish a 4-year HS in order to be able to enroll, and you can't, for example, go and study medicine if you've finished certain trade schools. 

Also, while EU countries generally don't charge tuition for other EU nationals, the cost of tuition for non-EU nationals can be staggering. 

And even with subsidies, if you're below a certain threshold, you're paying for college yourself. The state is also deciding which fields it wants to pay for, and which not. In my country, history gets ~100 state-funded scholarships per generation. Law school, on the other hand, gets ~800.


We have subsidies, and that may be fine, but we have to mitigate the risk by not allowing everyone to join, not allowing people to study whatever they want and not having that much freedom in our education choices. On the other hand, we don't have an entire generation burdened with non-dischargeable debt.  Personally, if I had enough money, US would have been my choice.

&gt; Food irradiation primarily extends the shelf-life of irradiated foods by effectively destroying organisms responsible for spoilage and foodborne illness and inhibiting sprouting.[3] Although consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means, because people imagine that the food is radioactive or mutated,[4] all independent research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have confirmed irradiation to be safe.

&gt; [‚Ä¶]

&gt; Food irradiation is permitted by over 60 countries, with about 500,000 metric tons of food annually processed worldwide.[10] The regulations that dictate how food is to be irradiated, as well as the food allowed to be irradiated, vary greatly from country to country. In Austria, Germany, and many other countries of the European Union only dried herbs, spices, and seasonings can be processed with irradiation and only at a specific dose, while in Brazil all foods are allowed at any dose.

&gt; The Cranberries is an alternative rock band from Limerick, Ireland that formed in 1989 and rose to mainstream popularity in the early 1990's. The band consists of Dolores O'Riordan (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Noel Hogan (guitars, vocals, also a member of Mono Band), Mike Hogan (bass, vocals), and Fergal Lawler (drums, percussion, also a member of The Low Network). The band went on hiatus in 2003 and reunited in the summer of 2009.

&gt; Combining the melodic jangle of post-The Smiths indie pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, The Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the indie scene of the early 90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. 

&gt; It wasn't until the lush ballad ""Linger"" became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of ""Linger"", The Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles like ""Dreams"", ""Zombie"" and ""Ode to My Family"". 

&gt; By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.

&gt; During the next few years, the band cancelled a large tour and rumours of a breakup were widespread. In 1999, they released Bury the Hatchet to mixed reviews. In 2001, the band issued Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to rave reviews. The album debuted at number 46 in the US charts. 

&gt; In 2002, The Cranberries released the compilation Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, which was supported by the single ""Stars"".

&gt; In 2003, The Cranberries announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers. They decided to put the next album on hold. After more than a dozen years of relentless touring and promotion, which had seen them clocking up album sales in excess of 43 million and playing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe, the band decided it was time for a break.

&gt; In 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released her debut solo album titled Are You Listening?. Two years later she released her second solo album, No Baggage.

&gt; On 25 August 2009, Dolores O'Riordan announced that The Cranberries will be reuniting for a North American tour to begin in mid-November 2009, to be followed by dates in Europe in early 2010. O'Riordan indicated that the band will be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of The Cranberries classic hits as well as some new music written by the group together.

&gt; The Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto (Canada) from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with producer Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all will be included on the album. The album is scheduled for release on 14 February, 2012.

&gt; On 26 May 2016, the Cranberries announced that they would start their next tour in Europe. The first show was held on June 3.

&gt; A new ""unplugged"" Cranberries album titled Something Else, featuring the band's hits along with three new songs, was released on 28 April 2017 through BMG. The album received mostly positive reviews. 

&gt; On 15 January 2018 lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died unexpectedly in London. She was 46 years old.

Meaning there hasn‚Äôt been as much time for it to be one contiguous market. While the US has always worked hard to maintain interstate commerce. 

That means the US was a much larger market, Germany, being the largest EU market only having 82 million people to the US‚Äô 350 million. 

Then you combine that with the fact that for most of America space is far cheaper, meaning grocery stores can be larger and have more shelf space, giving a wider variety of what can be offered. 

Does this mean America is freer? No, but it does mean we have more choices, on average at a typical grocery store. For example the average grocery store in the US has 40,000 skus, while in the EU it is closer to 10,000, often less. 

The next question then is, is more choices better? Research lately has shown that people actually prefer less choices at the grocery. Which is why stores like Aldi (having closer to 3,000 skus) are doing much better than other major brands. Even in the US companies such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe‚Äôs who stock mostly store label products are growing faster than tradition grocery stores.

Kaiserjager,1491794295.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16xxg8,False,"""Also, ever notice that the further someone is from white European heritage, the less specific it becomes?""

This is not necessarily true. I've seen people say Japanese-American for example, but I have also just heard ""Chinese"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Filipino"" without a hyphen. With ""African-American"" I believe it is less specific due to the history of slavery.

Also, even many people in America who identify as a hyphenated Americans don't necessarily consider themselves from that country. Someone might consider themselves Polish-American, but this doesn't mean they think they are Polish. For example, I grew up in an area with a large Polish-American population and a friend of mine's father grew up only speaking Polish for the first few years of his life, even going to a school taught in Polish until he was 5. There are still people in that town that only speak Polish despite being born here. Anyway his answer to the two questions of ""Are you American?"" and ""are you Polish-American?"" would be yes, but he doesn't think he's Polish in the sense of being from Poland because he isn't, but being Polish-American is a part of his identity due to the culture in America he grew up in. That said I do think the hyphenated American thing is stupid for a variety of reasons but I am not sure it is completely fair to say that this country is obsessed with ethnicity, I think for many it's just that the concept of American identity can be tricky due to a variety of subcultures and things they do differently from others, not that that doesn't get conflated with nationality. Then there is also foolishness like this ""Italian"" and his disapproval of pizza in Italy and love for NY Pizza, I mean everybody knows North Jersey has the best pizza.

The people support it. The corporate dems don't.

&gt; Last time I checked when you tell people their taxes will be raised to pay for MFA support drops like a rock.

So think about it for longer than a tweet. If you don't have to pay premiums or worry about coverage and can get preventative care (making the system cheaper as time goes on), it will result in a better society overall. People in Europe are willing and happy to pay more in taxes because they get so much value for it (not to mention helps boost confidence in government). You can't just end the conversation with higher taxes = bad. They have to be told what they stand to gain.

Correct. But Augustus also never called himself emperor. He actively refused royal titles, and styled himself the simple *princeps* or ""first citizen"" of the republic. His court was the senate of Rome.

By [this other article ALSO by the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31924912), using the European counting standard, Hershey's milk chocolate actually has 30% cocoa (non-fat cocoa powder + cocoa butter) vs. Cadbury's 23%.

_Steamed_Hams,1520384189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_109jzthf,False,"If there is a relatively smooth Brexit, most of those polled expect growth to pick up later in the year. However, several respondents warned that Brexit brinkmanship was doing lasting damage to the economy, with the prolonged uncertainty leading businesses to take irreversible decisions.

‚ÄúBusiness is now being told to prepare for a no deal Brexit and increasing numbers will relocate some operations. These decisions may not be reversed, even in the event of the best possible outcome for the economy, which would be to remain in the EU,‚Äù said Marian Bell, a former member of the monetary policy committee who runs the consultancy Alpha Economics.

Many respondents noted that even if a disorderly Brexit was averted, uncertainty over the UK‚Äôs future trading relations will limit the potential for a rebound, with the UK unlikely to return to pre-referendum levels of growth or to perform as well as its main trading partners.

‚ÄúEven if we sign a withdrawal agreement, I don‚Äôt believe this will unleash a spree of business investment. The UK is going to be approached generally on a ‚Äòcare and maintenance‚Äô basis by multinationals,‚Äù said Mark Gregory, chief economist at EY.

With businesses set for caution, the growth outlook hinges on consumers‚Äô willingness to spend. In theory, UK households are under less strain than a year ago, with real incomes finally rising as a tight labour market fuels pay increases and lower oil prices rein in inflation.

Yet many economists noted that consumer confidence looked fragile, and suggested that people were starting to worry that a hard Brexit would lead to job losses or hit house prices.

More than half said households would feel no better off at the end of 2019. One described real wage growth as ‚Äúweedy‚Äù and several said any change in living standards would depend more on how Brexit affected the pound and asset prices.

Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said low income households would not share equally in wage growth, with families facing a squeeze on benefits payments.

David Miles, professor at Imperial College, agreed. ‚ÄúA rise in real wages of, say, 1 to 2 per cent is hardly noticeable to most households,‚Äù he said. Chris Pissarides, at the LSE, said Brexit effects would mean ‚Äúthey will feel worse off, even if there is more money in the bank‚Äù.

Other respondents said consumers would feel slightly better off ‚Äî but cautioned that this would not necessarily boost consumption.

Jagjit Chadha, director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said high household debt levels suggested some people had been maintaining spending ‚Äúby borrowing from a richer future‚Äù ‚Äî and were now likely to pay off some debt rather than spending more.

Respondents offered a range of opinions on what could be done to boost the economy, with some seeing more scope than others for policymakers to support growth.

Prof Miles, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said interest rates were ‚Äúunlikely to change much at all‚Äù, since the BoE had little scope to cut them if there was a sharp shock.

‚ÄúIn the event of a chaotic Brexit, the BoE will lower rates. However, the impact will be limited, if a cut in rates is not accompanied by expansionary fiscal policy,‚Äù said Ann Pettifor, director of the network Policy Research in Macroeconomics.

Opinion was split on the chances of fiscal loosening. About half the respondents said the government would not live up to its promise to ‚Äúend austerity‚Äù in 2019 beyond the spending measures announced in the October budget. Several argued that chancellor Philip Hammond could not do more without breaking his own fiscal rules.

But a similar number said easing austerity was now a political imperative, regardless of Brexit. ‚ÄúThe government is not strong enough now to resist pressure to oil squeaky wheels,‚Äù said Howard Davies, chairman of RBS.

Many economists pointed out that Brexit prevented the UK tackling broader issues, such as chronic under-investment, poor productivity, fraying public services and ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù levels of deprivation.

‚ÄúThe big picture is that of an economy transitioning to a lower-growth equilibrium, marked by deficient domestic demand,‚Äù said Konstantinos Venetis, of the consultancy TS Lombard. ‚ÄúPolitical instability only makes matters worse.‚Äù

There are a number of details to be considered, of course.

Firstly the general agreement with Sweden as has been mentioned in other comments. NATO or not, they're likely our main ally.  
Also, while Finnish neutrality is partly a fa√ßade, it is taken seriously enough to be discussed as a problem with being in the EU; it does allow us to punch above our weight class diplomatically by acting as a neutral-ish part between NATO and Russia.  
Then, you have to weigh the impact on the economy of Russian retaliation for joining against the relative change in likelihood of being invaded.  
Also, the Finnish army largely consists of conscripts, which may complicate aiding other countries.  
Finally, though this one is anecdotal, a lot of people may not quite trust NATO to uphold their part of the deal in case  something does happen. Historically Western countries have been quite happy to completely ignore Finland whenever suitable for realpolitik. If this happens again, joining would mean potentially having to help Trump invade whichever sovereign country pisses him off on Twitter, while dealing with massive economic fallout from giving up the last pretence to neutrality, without getting anything in return but empty promises that may or may not deter an invader depending on how much they are believed.

So basically the disparity in the canadian schools that were used in this study was due to teacher bias through grade inflation. 50% of the grade is due to exam results, 50% is due to teacher evaluation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of recent history, teacher assigned marks were disproportionally higher than the exam marks, or otherwise known as ""grade inflation"". While grade inflation in and of itself is not entirely uncommon, usually covering up declining educational standards, the inflation of girls' grades were significantly and consistently higher. Meanwhile, the exam results from boys in provincial exams were equal or higher than those of girls in 5 out of 6 subjects.

According to Dr. Jim Dueck, this discrimination is prevalent throughout north america and western europe. It is also part of the reason why a lot of higher educational institutions now have a higher female to male ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, there is a growing body of research that attributes the apparent advantage females enjoy in the public school system to their more compliant and more passive behaviour in the classroom. Males are more likely to exhibit skepticism about subject matter and to challenge their instruction. This behavioural difference appears to  be the source of negative discrimination towards males in modern schools.

yodatsracist,1353699705.0,,soc,[],,Sociology of Religion,dark,text,t2_9ouov,False,"So globalization is often characterized by increasingly free flows of goods, services, capital, information, and people across international boundaries. Focusing *only* on that last one (the free flow of people), there‚Äôs good research that seems to indicate that the free flow of lower skilled immigrants causes a right way populist backlash in a way that the free flow of higher skilled immigrants does not (think, for example, of the flows of asylum seekers to Europe vs. Canada‚Äôs points based immigration system, if you‚Äôre familiar with either of these). See for example, ‚Äú[Skill of the Immigrants and Vote of the Natives: Immigration and Nationalism in European Elections 2007-2016](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25077)‚Äù by economists Simone Moriconi, Giovanni Peri, and Riccardo Turati. 

&gt; In this paper we document the impact of immigration at the regional level on Europeans‚Äô political preferences as expressed by voting behavior in parliamentary or presidential elections between 2007 and 2016. We combine individual data on party voting with a classification of each party's political agenda on a scale of their ""nationalistic"" attitudes over 28 elections across 126 parties in 12 countries. To reduce immigrant selection and omitted variable bias, we use immigrant settlements in 2005 and the skill composition of recent immigrant flows as instruments. OLS and IV estimates show that **larger inflows of highly educated immigrants were associated with a change in the vote of citizens away from nationalism. However the inflow of less educated immigrants was positively associated with a vote shift towards nationalist positions. These effects were stronger for non-tertiary educated voters and in response to non-European immigrants.** We also show that they are consistent with the impact of immigration on individual political preferences, which we estimate using longitudinal data, and on opinions about immigrants. Conversely, immigration did not affect electoral turnout. Simulations based on the estimated coefficients show that immigration policies balancing the number of high-skilled and low-skilled immigrants from outside the EU would be associated with a shift in votes away from nationalist parties in almost all European regions.

So, it‚Äôs not as simple globalization (here, the free flows of people) help lead to outcome X, but the specifics of how globalization is handled/implemented. I imagine for the other flows, it similarly depends not merely on the existence of such flows, but how they are specifically implemented.

frizzle_,1331567561.0,,english,[],,South East London,dark,text,t2_75icd,False,"Neoliberalism¬†or¬†neo-liberalism[1]¬†is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with¬†laissez-faire¬†economic liberalism¬†and¬†free market¬†capitalism.[2]:7[3]Those ideas include¬†economic liberalizationpolicies such as¬†privatization,¬†austerity,¬†deregulation,¬†free trade[4]¬†and reductions in¬†government spending¬†in order to increase the role of the¬†private sector¬†in the¬†economy¬†and¬†society.[12]¬†These market-based ideas and the policies they inspired constitute a¬†paradigm shift¬†away from the post-war¬†Keynesianconsensus which lasted from 1945 to 1980.[13][14]
English-speakers have used the term ""neoliberalism"" since the start of the 20th century with different meanings,[15]¬†but it became more prevalent in its current meaning in the 1970s and 1980s, used by scholars in a wide variety of¬†social sciences[16][17]¬†as well as by critics.[18][19]¬†Modern advocates of free market policies avoid the term ""neoliberal""[20]and some scholars have described the term as meaning different things to different people[21][22]¬†as neoliberalism ""mutated"" into geopolitically distinct hybrids as it travelled around the world.[5]¬†As such, neoliberalism shares many attributes with other concepts that have contested meanings, including¬†democracy.[23]
The definition and usage of the term have changed over time.[6]¬†As an¬†economic philosophy, neoliberalism emerged among European¬†liberal¬†scholars in the 1930s as they attempted to trace a so-called ""third"" or ""middle"" way between the conflicting philosophies of¬†classical liberalism¬†and¬†socialist planning.[24]:14‚Äì15¬†The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which neoliberals mostly blamed on the¬†economic policy¬†of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term ""neoliberal"" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more¬†laissez-faire¬†doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a¬†market economy¬†under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the¬†social market economy.
In the 1960s, usage of the term ""neoliberal"" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with¬†Augusto Pinochet's¬†economic reforms¬†in¬†Chile, the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and¬†laissez-faire¬†capitalist set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of¬†Mont Pelerin Society¬†economists¬†Friedrich Hayek,¬†Milton Friedman¬†and¬†James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as¬†Margaret Thatcher,¬†Ronald Reagan¬†and¬†Alan Greenspan.[6][25]Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of¬†political economy.[6]¬†By 1994, with the passage of¬†NAFTA¬†and with the¬†Zapatistas' reaction to this development in¬†Chiapas, the term entered global circulation.[5]¬†Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.[17][26]

\- A stable, long-standing clan with passion and a burning desire for all things Destiny

\- A place to call home (this is a big one!)

\- A platform for both PvE and PvP with like-minded players

\- Players who are looking to be part of a team for the long term. We don‚Äôt want players who log on once a week solely for a raid and aren‚Äôt active in Discord!

\- Players with a good raiding background, but also willing to improve and thorough knowledge about the game

Well, there's three ways to go; 

* Apply for a Combined residence and employment permit at the Immigrant and Naturalisation Service (IND). Check here: [https://ind.nl/en/work](https://ind.nl/en/work). Please note; you can ask your future employer to request the permit for you. This helps accelerate and increase your chances! 

* Apply for a family reunification (since your GF lives here?). You will probably need to apply to be legal partners. I can imagine you might not want to do this Here: [https://ind.nl/en/family](https://ind.nl/en/family)

* Apply for a study permit here: [https://ind.nl/en/study](https://ind.nl/en/study). You will need to enrol and finish in a study, which costs at least ‚Ç¨20k per year.

Here's the costs that are involved, looks like you (or probably your future employer) will need to pay ‚Ç¨285 for your permit and it's renewals. [https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Costs.aspx](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Costs.aspx)

gardenofjew,1323045629.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6dh6i,False,"&gt;&gt;we know for a fact that if you average the height of a man and a woman, then either add 2.5 inches (for a boy) or subtract 2.5 inches (for a girl) we can predict with excellent confidence the eventual adult height of their child +/- an inch. Predictions are more likely wrong at the extremes with some reversion to the mean, but you can predict height better than just about any other polygenic phenomenon (and excepting people with things like achondroplasia or gigantism, it's definitely polygenic).

You can do the same thing with IQ, FYI. If you know the IQ of someone's biological parents, you can make very rough estimates about their likely IQ. If you know the estimates of their siblings, their uncles and aunts, their grandparents, in addition to their parents, you can make better, but still noisy estimates. It is a straightforward consequence of IQ being polygenic and strongly heritable-- the phenotypes of relatives are useful for predicting hte phenotype of offpring.

&gt;&gt;It's almost certainly significantly heritable (though even that statement is controversial)


**This is not controversial**. This is demonstrated in 100+ years of extremely consistent results in behavioral genetics-- starting with Galton and his study of adopted sons of eminent individuals, then Cecil Burt, then onto other twin studies, Bouchard, Minnesota Twin Studies, more modern extended-family methods, etc. It is among the most replicated results in psychology. To pretend otherwise is dishonest.

&gt;&gt;The Dutch are certainly the tallest people in the world right now - but they weren't 400 years ago (as evidenced by door frames). What changed? Was it genetic drift? No. It was nutrition.

I'm not sure that this is actually true. Was the rank order of height among different human populations drastically different 100 years ago? How about 500 years ago?

European Americans had better access to nutrition than Europeans for a while, and were consequently quite tall relative to Europe. Now Denmark is quite a bit taller. But Danish-Americans are still taller than other Americans. And height increases have stopped-- almost like there's a ceiling on how good an environment has to be before it's good enough and stops affecting a phenotype. 

Even if it was, gene-environment interactions in height do not make empirical study of intelligence an impossibly challenging subject. You can do stuff like admixture analysis ala medical genetics, polygenic scores of intelligence in different groups (currently not possible because of the problem of linkage decay in GWAS studies + underrepresentation of most minorities in GWAS datasets), etc. You can also test for gene-environment interactions in more traditional behavioral genetics studies, and while those exist to some degree for some other traits, like educational attainment and alcohol consumption, they don't exist for IQ. 

Regarding group membership not being a great predictor of traits-- sure, but it depends on the trait and the group. Basically any Pygmy is shorter than any non-Pygmy population, excepting people with achondroplasia or other types of dwarfism.  And just because something is not a perfect predictor, doesn't mean it isn't useful. Medicine uses shitty but better than nothing predictors all the time.

Oh, ok. I've been there. Now I'm less active, but I used to post ideas and discussions, and I experimented a lot.

Let's see, for some basic tips:

* there are 2 types of formatting on reddit, Fancy Pants (the default, which shows you the style while you write it) and Markdown; if you're in Markdown, when you want to add a new line, at the end of a line you need to add 2+ white spaces, otherwise Markdown won't interpret it as a new line
* choose carefully the time when to post, considering timezones; you might want to choose a time where both american and european redditors are awake, and maybe in a break (like a time that simultaneously gets lunch break for americans and work end for europeans; something like 18pm in Rome time should work; google it to see what time it is in your timezone)
* use synthetic titles that fully explain the core concepts of your idea (for example, you might have tried summarizing your rework concept in the title itself)
* add the TLDR at the beginning of the post, not at the end
* highlight the TLDR as much as you can, for example make it bold like here (**TL;DR**) and separate it from the rest of the text with something (like this: --------------)

I do not accept that Marx's ideas are disproved by a totalitarian state imposing totalitarianism on their people and various satelitte states while calling it Communism or Socialism. I take Commuism to mean basically what Marx meant, and Socialism as a broader term given to all attempts to curb capitalism by way of unions, worker rights, and redistribution of the wealth generated within a society, by the whole of that society. This includes the social democracy parties of the Nordic countries and most of Western Europe.

The Nordic countres, where such 'social democracy' has actually been tried, we have better equality and more certain civil rights.

The attitude towards the opioid epidemic needs to change drastically. Restricting opioids to the point that legitimate pain patients does nothing but harm and does absolutely nothing to help the epidemic. In fact, it makes it worse because addicts will just turn to heroin. Many pain patients commit suicide because they can't get relief from their suffering. Addiction is a disease, not a moral issue or character flaw. The argument for prescription heroin and other replacement drugs is just, ""Yeah but they're doing heroin!!""

Leaving aside the impossibility of measuring something as inherently subjective as ""greatest country"", you should concentrate on proving the US is mediocre to back up your premise.

You state the metrics that comprehensively valuate countries, and then give examples of one's that beat the US on balance. The challenge will be others who point out things you leave out.

From my subjective point of view, the first division between ""good"" country and ""bad"" country would be the base availability of life. ""no matter what the socioeconomic circumstances, does a citizen have a reasonable expectation they will have food, shelter, and security"". As with *most* first world countries, the US is a solid ""yes"".

Then you move past necessities to comfort.

""no matter what the socioeconomic circumstances, does a citizen have a reasonable expectation of a *comfortable* life.

Even the very poor in the US have climate control, leisure entertainment, and some mobility. Again, *most* first world countries do as well, although it is narrowing more.

After needs, and physical comfort/leisure, I would put the nebulous ""freedom"" as the next priority. Freedom is tough because different people value different freedoms. Europeans value the freedom to be responsible for their personal security less importantly than many Americans. Therefore they don't see much value in freedom to have personal weapons.

Freedom of movement is near universal among first world countries, but does ding some of the edge cases.

Freedom of speech is the same as above.

Freedom to succeed, or improve your circumstances is incredibly important, but also impossible to make a comprehensive determination. It is not universal to every human, regardless of country. A low intelligence, low ambition, weak work ethic person won't likely improve their circumstances wherever they are. Now other countries, especially in Europe, may have more support to those trying to improve themselves, but it could be argued the US has the diversity of opportunities that other first world countries do not. 

I think it pretty obvious that ""mediocre""  is a silly label to put on the US. Regardless of our flaws, opportunity outweighs obstacles to any who are capable and ambitious. Every first world country has its problems in different areas. You can cherry-pick metrics to make grand statements about any of them. I just think we should look at how populations actually live before trying to insist one place is comprehensively better than another. There isn't a huge exodus out of the US to other countries. If you want to compare equitable population size and diversity, you would have to compare to the EU as a whole. If you look at the EU as a single entity, it is pretty easy to pick out ""bad"" areas that an unfair person could trumpet.

But it has the effect that ends up stifling smaller club's growth, thus maintaining a status quo of large teams. It allows the rich clubs to stay rich while poorer clubs struggle to keep up with the huge spending of those above them.

Originally, it was intended to stop rich owners pumping money into the club in loans, who could then legally demand it back. If the club can't meet repayments, it could potentially be forced into liquidation (the selling of assets to continue repayment). UEFA didn't want clubs, many of whom have existed for over 100 years, to essentially disappear purely because of greed from rich owners.

The problem is that the majority of club owners are not like this, and as I said previously it means clubs cannot spend the same on players as big clubs.

We are one of the leading countries in wood industry

We have one of the best air qualities in the world because of our forests

We are one of the most diplomatically outreached countries

Our passports rank in top 5 strongest

We hosted meeting of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin

Tourism to North Finland is exploding

Our citizens are the happiest in the world

Our education system is the second to best after south korea

Our country ranks always as one of the top countries in Pisa tests (leaving u.s. far behind)

The successes of Finland in winter war was one of the reasons why Hitler attacked Soviet Union without preparing well enough

Finland has one of the most efficient healthcare systems

Finland has started big trades with China, leading to great economic advance and China will do even more co-operation with Finland and the other Europe after US set the customs, this will also make us more workplaces

Also we are one of the most equal countries

And we have little to no corruption

To my last point: Our country and the whole rest of Europe isn't divided to liberal left and authoritarian right, like the U.S. is.

Still think we are irrelevant?

Also, if you are so insecure about Europe being better, I'm gonna use Ben Shapiro's words and say: Facts don't care about your feelings

Also I could have said any European country as my example of a better society, like Germany for instance or France.

In Afghanistan, the US has had troops on the ground for nearly 20 years. I'm sorry, but if whatever objective you were aiming to achieve wasn't reachable in nearly two decades, and you *still* don't have a clear outline for what you want to get done before you leave or when that job will be done... it's never going to happen. As for Syria... shouldn't there be some kind of public case made, some kind of general buy-in, before soldiers are sent in to occupy a foreign nation? When did this happen? When did the public debate take place? And again, what's the clear goal you're aiming to achieve there, how soon can you achieve it, by what methods?

However... the idea of breaking up NATO is much much less practical.

The fact that we've enjoyed nearly a century of peace and prosperity since then is a testament to how successful they've been. And...

Gun violence - is not an issue (considering our culture and the number of guns in the United States. Gun violence is generally uncommon. The average American will never have to deal with gun violence. Period. It‚Äôs rare.

Education - yes, we accrue way more debt that most countries. That does not mean our education system is bad. America should change its name to ‚Äúland of first world problems‚Äù. Other countries send students TO America to get their education. It‚Äôs less common to leave to get a degree. That‚Äôs a fact. Our general system and our credentials actually mean more than most other place (partly because we choose what we want to accept as a par education. Interestingly enough the fact that America is a leading nation in deciding something like that speak volumes to our influence, importance, power, and education system. Could it be improved? Absolutely. Is there an education crises related to quality of education. I would absolutely say no.

Politics - what other countries don‚Äôt realize is that our politics affect them almost more than they affect us. As a left leaner who HATES Donald trump. He honestly hasn‚Äôt affected myself or anyone I know. However I‚Äôm very active in opposition to trump. Europeans would have you believe that America is falling apart due to trump what that couldn‚Äôt be father from the truth.

Politics to Americans is recreation. We argue about politics out of boredom (this is where I‚Äôm going to get downvoted most, but it‚Äôs true). Now, are MOST people 100% unaffected by trump in America? Hell no. Many have lost jobs and money. However again, those that are *seriously* affected are in fact a vast minority. 

In other words, trump isn‚Äôt enough to destroy this country. Even though outsiders believe that to be true.

Gun violence- again, Europeans really enjoy telling us what we should and should not value. 

Americans value owning guns. Plain and simple.

You can not peacefully take away guns from Americans. Any politician with power that would announce a ban on guns would be hard pressed to keep their job. 

What we have to do is continue what we‚Äôre doing and regulate as best we can. 

School shootings aren‚Äôt common 

a BB gun near a school is NOT a school shooting 

An accidental discharge of a weapon is NOT a school shooting 

One person being killed by a gun unrelated to school and near school grounds is NOT a school shooting 

A stray bullet landing in a school zone is NOT a school shooting.

Every day police pull over 50,000 people. All our police carry guns

50,000 interactions with police A DAY. 

Now compare that to how many people police kill each day.

See? We don‚Äôt even have a police brutality problem. Institutionalized racism is not violent. It has to stay quiet. Police brutality is the worst way to express racism. 

We do not have a police issue.

Here is one issue we have.

Other countries telling us what to do while they ignore riots(France), isolation(UK), segregation(SA), force military conscription(various), have extremely difficult citizenship requirements(Germany), control a wasteland with the air quality of a 40 year old chain smoker(China), and have a drunk driving rate TWICE as high as the UK(Canada), 

Fix your shit Europe, Asia...and everyone else.

America is fucking fine. 

Edit: I want to clarify. There are Americans being affected. But let‚Äôs take this holiday season for example. Pretty quiet huh? Weird how the ‚Äúcrises‚Äù we‚Äôre in can wait until after the holiday season. This is a testament to how nonchalant we really are about politics. We can afford to ignore politics for a couple months 

Edit 2: I forgot to mention FREEDOM. Go to China and say ‚Äúfuck the Chinese President‚Äù. Go to almost any European nation and speak harshly against the government. I‚Äôm very curious to see the comparative consequences.

Since you seem to just have copy/pasted the bulk of your comment, I'm sure you won't mind if I copy/paste my reply from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ab6vdp/no10_admits_there_is_still_more_work_to_do_to_get/ecytftv/?context=1)!

So, firstly I note that you have only listed a few EU countries' GDP as evidence that the EU is in trouble, rather than all EU GDP data, and only Q3 numbers at that rather than than the last several quarters. Also, no link to where you are getting these numbers from. Also, you add in the USA in a conversation about the EU GDP statistics, because.... why? Seriously, why did you add that in?

According to the data taken from [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9437650/2-07122018-AP-EN.pdf/eadec005-b37c-42e2-a8e7-a8bfc2e74f1d), which was in turn found via the [Eurostat website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/national-accounts), we see the following:

UK: 2017 Q4 +0.4, 2018 Q1 +0.1, Q2 +0.4, Q3 +0.6

Germany: 2017 Q4 +0.5, 2018 Q1 +0.4, Q2 +0.5, Q3 -0.2

Sweden: 2017 Q4 +0.6, 2018 Q1 +0.8, Q2 +0.5, Q3 -0.2

Lithuania: 2017 Q4 +1.3, 2018 Q1 +1.0, Q2 +0.9, Q3 -0.3

Italy: 2017 Q4 +0.3, 2018 Q1 +0.3, Q2 +0.2, Q3 -0.1

So from just the countries you originally listed we can see overall positive numbers over the prior 3 quarters with only negatives in the one quarter you chose to display. 

Hmm, choosing to display only a narrow part of a data set in order to support a point? [There is a name for that sort of thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking). 

Additionally, given that the UK has strong growth while *inside* the EU, would you agree that this shows that the EU is, at the very least, not necessarily a barrier to GDP growth?

&gt;Germany, Italy and France also look to have a bad Q4. 

Citation needed.

&gt;But as these figures show, the UK will have had a good Q4.

Citation needed.

&gt;Consider that the countries that have pledged eternal loyalty to the EU are being Flushed Down the Toilet of Recession.

As far as can be gleaned from the data, they aren't. They have had growth for 3 of the last four quarters -hardly a trip down the shitter. 

Also, you mention France above despite not listing it in the numbers above. Not surprising since with a Q3 of +0.4 it wouldn't have fit in your cherry picker. (its prior 3 quarters were +0.7, +0.2, +0.2, for anyone wondering).

&gt;are being Flushed Down the Toilet of Recession.

Germany, Lithuania, Sweden and Italy are the ***only*** Eu countries not seeing growth in Q3, all of the EU countries (that you failed to list the numbers for) are seeing GDP growth in Q3 *and* in prior quarters.

&gt; Billy Ocean (born Leslie Sebastian Charles, 21 January 1950, Fyzabad, Trinidad) is a Grammy Award-winning British popular music performer who had a string of rhythm and blues-tinged international pop hits in the 1970s and 1980s. He was the main British R&amp;B singer / songwriter of the 1980s. He waited seven years after scoring his first four UK top 20 successes, before accumulating a series of transatlantic successes, including three U.S. number ones.

&gt; He was born in Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago to Grenadian parents, and moved to England with his family at the age of eight. Oceans' musical influence came at an early age of his life, as his father was a musician, and realised he was inline to follow those ambitions as he was growing up. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in London clubs while also working as a tailor in London's Savile Row. He released his first single in 1972 on Spark Records as Les Charles.

&gt; When in Trinidad as a boy he adopted the name Billy Ocean, taking the surname from the local football team 'Ocean's Eleven', who had gotten the name from the famous film of the same name. The next year, 1976, was when he recorded his first album, Billy Ocean, with its first single release, ""Love Really Hurts Without You,"" charting at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and number 22 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. More successes ensued, including ""L.O.D. (Love On Delivery)"". He also wrote songs for other artists, such as La Toya Jackson. In 1981, he scored the U.S. R&amp;B chart with ""Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)"".

&gt; Ocean's period of greatest success began with Suddenly during 1984, and its main single, ""Caribbean Queen"". The song's title and lyrics were changed for different regions, such that the song is also known as ""African Queen"" or ""European Queen"". The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards. The album's title track also became a success, its score maximizing at #4 in both the US and the UK; and the song ""Loverboy"", while also being a #2 US success during 1985, from the album, was also the background music for the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series, Casualty, during 1986.

&gt; Ocean appeared at Live Aid in 1985, singing ""Caribbean Queen"" and ""Loverboy"", from the JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

&gt; His 1986 album Love Zone also sold well. It included the successful singles ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" (the theme from the film The Jewel of the Nile); this was a number one success in the UK and a number two in the U.S.; and ""There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)"" (a U.S. number one, and also a major UK success). Also included were the title track and ""Love Is Forever"", which were #10 and #16 U.S. successes for Ocean, respectively.

&gt; In February 1986, Ocean's video of ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" was banned by the BBC, owing to non-union members (including Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito) miming to backing vocals.

&gt; Ocean's next album, Tear Down These Walls (1988) featured another number one single, ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car"", while the album was certified platinum.

&gt; His 1993 album Time to Move On failed to produce any major successes, but his 1989 Greatest Hits collection has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation Love Is For Ever made #7 on the UK album chart. Ocean's last studio album for Jive Records was Time to Move On, which he recorded in Chicago with R&amp;B star R. Kelly. It turned out that R. Kelly had been a long-time admirer of the way Ocean was able to mix the more emotive soul style with a crossover popular style.

&gt; In 2002, the University of Westminster awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. The awards ceremony took place in the Barbican Centre, in London. He continues to tour and record in Europe. He lives in Sunningdale, Berkshire with his wife of 27 years, Judy; and their three children Cherie, Antony and Rachel. Ocean is now a patron for Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech. He regularly visits to hold clinics and seminars for the students.

&gt; In October 2007, Ocean commenced his first British tour in over 15 years. In February and March 2008 he toured Australia and the Far East. His new album, Because I Love You was released on 2 February 2009. To coincide with this new tour and album launch, Ocean has been working with Adoseof Design on a website revision which is due March 2009.

The drawback is that it would become wildly more expensive for individuals to fly, so you move toward the situation nearly every other country has: only large commercial entities can afford to fly.

sooprvylyn,1350717921.0,,,[],,Resident Textile Expert,dark,text,t2_9cxrr,False,"Well that's kinda of a hard question to answer...there are a whole lot of brands(nobody can possibly know them all) out there and what makes something worth the money differs from person to person. I'm also not of average size(I'm the giant guy in my 1st link); I don't buy clothes the same way most people do so my experience is mostly limited to market research for the brands I've designed for...which unfortunately aren't the types of clothes most redditors would be into(think Tommy Bahama type stuff). I'm also a little older than the average redditor so that makes it harder to suggest brands that younger guys would be into.  I can certainly give some general guidelines though.

1. If it's super popular hype beast stuff you are gonna be paying for hype(looking at you Supreme).  Same goes for luxury brands, but at least with them you usually get pretty high quality because they have a lot of margin to play with and don't have to cut corners.

2. If it's in your average mall it's likely priced properly, there is a lot of competition for your dollars in the mall.  That said most stores in the mall aren't great quality but kinda low to middle of the road.  Some of the better standard mall options I see posted in here often are j crew, banana republic.  H&amp;M and Zara sorry to say is mostly garbage but that shouldn't surprise anyone here...good deals on fast fashion tho.

3. Anything made in low quantities, especially artisan level, is likely to be very well made and appropriately priced, yet expensive cuz making clothes well is a lot of work.  It's also more likely to be ethically made.

4. Anything made in USA, Europe or japan is generally going to be of good quality and as long as it's not some super popular hype/luxury brand the price should be reasonable for what you get. There is a lot of price/quality breadth with this but its pretty hard to find low quality stuff out of 1st world.countries. The only thing I'd warn is that 1st world doesn't equal ethical, plenty of sweatshops.and shady practices in these countries.  

5. Never skip out on stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx and Nordstrom rack...but burn Ross to the ground with a Molotov(total garbage in Ross).  These stores are gonna give you the best bang for your buck. Not everything in them is gold, but it's easy to find some really really good stuff here at very reasonable prices if you can tolerate last year's style(which is fine for basic bastard stuff).  Brands have to unload unsold product and these are the stores they do this at. Nordstrom rack in particular has some good quality items.  These discounters pay pennies on the dollar for most of the stuff they get so you can get some very very good deals if you know what to look for.


The fact is that any brands that make decent quality and also make popular styles is going to add at least a little label tax, they'd be stupid not to.  My best advice honestly is to learn a bit about fabrics and clothing construction so you can identify quality when you see it first hand. You don't need to be an expert but it would be helpful to know something about the fibers you tend to like(for me its natural fibers), and how to tell good versions apart from bad versions. Go to higher end stores and look at the clothes and fabrics.  Check out the inside of the garment to see how it's sewn together and take note, read the content labels, notice the fabric and what makes it special, that's what you need to look for when shopping other stores. It takes a little while to get good at it but it's a life skills.worth having since you'll need clothes til you die.

I know it's not the list of good guys you wanted but best I can do based on my knowledge base and other limiting factors as mentioned above.

Edit: the number 1 fiber dudes should learn about is cotton.  Cotton has a lot of variance so it's one of the more complex ones to.learn to identify, but it's also one of the most common fibers.  There is a big difference between the cotton in an etro button down and the cotton in an h&amp;m tee shirt.  One will fall apart in a few washes and the other should last a few years.  

Edit 2: pricing is often a good indicator of quality, but of course taken with a grain of salt.  Keep in mind what I said about hype/luxury shit above.....FULL RETAIL pricing like this for brands that aren't hype/luxury:

Cotton Tees...above $30 should net you a very good quality tee, if you pay more than maybe $80 on a tee you are certainly getting ripped off...and that $80 tee should feel incredibly soft and smooth with very little fuzziness on the fabric surface. Anything less than $15 is going to be crap....remember this is full retail, and I'm not talking about screen printing blanks like guildan and canvas.

Cotton ocbd/sportshirts...above $50 is where decent quality starts to kick in and goes up to about $200 before you start getting real diminishing returns on price vs quality.  The $50 shirt is what I'd call fair quality and should last a couple years of normal wear....that $200 shirt is pretty high quality, made of long staple yarns, with felled or taped construction throughout as well as high end buttons, high stitch count and maybe some expensive fabric treatments. Below $25 on a sportshirt and you are buying trash.

Jeans/chinos/pants....pricing is pretty similar to shirts so I won't reiterate the same points.  

Althetic stuff...well this is a mixed bag.  Basics like gym shorts/pants and shirts/sweatshirts should run in the $40-100 range, after that you are def paying a label tax.  Technical garments otoh can get pretty pricey and honestly you'll likely pay some label tax on those cuz the big popular brands are the ones who can afford the R&amp;D to develop that stuff.

Other items(sweaters, jackets etc) are harder to generalize pricing on because there is a big variance in raw materials that can drastically effect price.  A wool sweater and a cashmere sweater aren't the same thing so one is gonna cost $50 and the other might cost $300 for a fair price/quality.  Also the items above can be made of fancier fabrics/fibers, but if you are looking at those you probably know why they are $$$$.

It's not, but ignoring the result of the referendum until you get the answer you want is.

Want to have a second referendum? Feel free, after Brexit has occurred and a reasonable period of time has passed. You don't hold a vote again after an election and before the party who won is in office, so why should we do it for this?

&gt;did they know in 2016 that russians were heavily influencing the leave campaign and social media. Did they know the leave campaign repeatedly broke the law to achieve the desired result?

Funny how you don't mention the meddling from the EU...

And in any case, all elections have some meddling from foreign powers, whether through propaganda, or otherwise. That has never been a reason to invalidate an election, and i don't see why it should be different here.

If there is proof that actual votes were changed, and that the numbers of people voting for or against were altered, then that is an entirely different matter, but as far as i know that is not the case, and indeed most of the complaints against the leave campaign could quite easily be applied to the stay campaign as well as most other campaigns in other elections in the UK. 

&gt;did they know that leaving wasnt like turning off a light switch, that it would involve pain and drama?

Same arguments applies to literally every election. 

""Did they know X party wasn't actually going to be able to fullfill Y promise?"", that's a standard occurrence, and has never invalidated an election.

&gt;there were people who were not eligble to vote in 2016, who are now eligible, but we must also silence their voices for the sake of democracy?

Which leaves the question: what is that?  At least for Germany, they only choose U-Bahn train systems that are not linked to trams. Also,  S-Bahn-Trains are not counted.   


Only Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Nuremberg have such a U-Bahn-System, however, many German cities have Mixed Tram/ Underground Trains that travel underground only in congested city centres (eg. in Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, many of the cities in the Ruhr district, Stuttgart, etc.) and S-Bahns, which are trains that run mostly from the suburbs into the city and are run by the National Railways as opposed to local administration.   


These do not technically qualify as Metro systems, because they are strongly liable to outside influence (weather, traffic, accidents etc.) but of course not taking them into consideration is problematic. It heavily distorts the data if you want to make conclusions about public transport in general.   


  
Germany has more large cities than other countries (London and Paris are, together with their suburbs, up to ten times larger than the next city in their country). Local administration generally opted to only tunnel in the city centre for budget reasons.  


All of the cities (sans Hamburg) with a Metro also have a seperate tram system and all of them also have a S-Bahn.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: allways look carefully at your data before you make any conclusions, second: definitions matter.   


I only looked at German systems because I know more about them. I am sure other countries have the same definition problems.  


However, the concentration aspect could be true: if the city dominates its peers, it is more likely to get national subsidies for public transport compared to one amongst many average-sized cities.

&gt; A member of Britain‚Äôs parliament, speaking on condition of anonymity to The Times, said that correspondence had been received from a member of the public, named as Martin Waplington, who said that Corbyn told him he would be voting to leave the bloc.

As was pointed out, it wasn't on camera.  It's a ""he said, he said"".  

But Corbyn's history as a Euro Skeptic is clear.  He voted Leave in the prior vote.  He refused to attend a single Remain Labour rally. Even now, he's clearly against a People's Vote.

And had the statement Corbyn made to Waplington been on camera, Corbyn's political career would likely have ended that night.

InvisibleTextArea,1420025452.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kf78w,False,"&gt; Banca Carige, Italy‚Äôs 10th-largest lender, has had its stock trading suspended and its management temporarily taken over by European regulators after the majority of its board resigned on January 2.
&gt; 
&gt; The European Central Bank appointed three temporary administrators and a surveillance committee to ensure stable running of the lender and its 482 branches. Two of the ECB administrators are the bank‚Äôs current chief executive and chair.
&gt; 
&gt; A statement from the ECB on January 2 said the decision to impose a temporary administration was ‚Äúan early intervention measure aimed at ensuring continuity and pursuing the objectives of a strategic plan‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; The 536-year-old lender also had its shares suspended for the day by Consob, the Italian regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; Banca Carige had presented a plan to the European regulator with an extended deadline of December 30 on how it would solve its balance sheet problems and raise more money.
&gt; 
&gt; The lender had issued two successful bond deals and was planning to convert a further number of its bonds into shares in order to bring its solvency back into line with what European regulators require, according to press statements by Banca Carige.
&gt; 
&gt; But its largest investor refused to approve the last deal to convert the bonds into stock.
&gt; 
&gt; Vittorio Malacalza, a local businessman who is the bank‚Äôs top investor, holding more than 20% of its shares, blocked the share conversion, according to a representative from the ECB.
&gt; 
&gt; In December, Malacalza Investimenti, the businessman‚Äôs holding company, told Reuters that it did not oppose the cash call in principle, but wanted more detail on the bank‚Äôs business plan and merger options, the newswire reported.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank was then meant to propose a new solution that would put its balance sheet in order. During its December 22 shareholder meeting, the bank‚Äôs shareholders and its board could not agree on a plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Two board members then resigned on December 23 ‚Äî deputy chair Lucrezia Reichlin and Raffaele Mincione. On January 2, they were followed by chair Pietro Modiano, chief executive Fabio Innocenzi, and three other directors.
&gt; 
&gt; Modiano and Innocenzi are among the ECB‚Äôs three temporary administrators for Banca Carige, it said in its statement, alongside Raffaele Lener.
&gt; 
&gt; In a January 2 statement from Carige, Modiano said the ECB‚Äôs move would ‚Äúsimplify and strengthen the governance of Carige‚Äù while Lener pledged ‚Äúoperational continuity‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Modiano, a former UniCredit banker, and Innocenzi, who was at UBS, were only brought in to Banca Carige by Malacalza in September, after a clash between the investment group and former chief executive Paolo Fiorentino.",True,False,False,,0,1546448424,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed354pc,True,t3_abudem,False,t3_abudem,/r/Economics/comments/abudem/ecb_takes_control_of_italys_banca_carige/ed354pc/,,1550777192,8,True,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,r/Economics,public,

kuddlesworth9419,1369589557.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_btage,False,"It's a surplus Polish Lavvu 2 man tent. They are incredibly well designed, robust, high quality, super cheap and perform excellent in the winter. They are very popular amongst long term European campers as they have been up for surplus for decades. Mine is dated 1984 for example but they date back well before then.

It's a very simple yet effective tent, there is only a single aluminium pole however you can get rid of it if you wish and either tie the top of the tent to a branch or make your own centre pole. The tent can be broken into two parts making two poncho's and the arm holes for the tent are commonly used as flume holes for a wood burner. There is however no groundsheet but you can work around this by buying your own groundsheet or what I do is I just use my German rubber poncho as a groundsheet instead. On YouTube there are quite a few people who have heavily modified them to modernise the design somewhat although this increases the weight substantially and means you can no longer use the tent as two poncho's or use them as tarps above. It's a very versatile design. You can even get I think 8 of them to construct a massive tent to house 8 people if you so desire. There is a diagram of this on the internet somewhat. And because it's so simple you can erect the tent up in 5 minutes in a rush you could do it in less time then that.

There is literally no feature on the tent that is wasted it's a fantastic design. You can pick them up for well under ¬£50. I don't blame you by the way I blame the general concurrences. Cotton is looked down upon because it's an old materiel most people shrug it off as such without realising the benefits of cotton and it's disadvantages. They say very childish things like cotton kills without even stopping to understand the fabric at all. They will spout rubbish that companies that have a vested interest in synthetic materials essentially make up. Even cotton manufacturers are guilty of this to just look at Ventile fabric and look at the premiums they can charge for it because of the marketing. They create an ecosystem where people are willing to pay money for fabric that is incredibly cheap to manufacture. There are many different cotton fabrics they are not all created equal but Ventile sits up high essentially because of the marketing but if you look into the different fabrics you will realise there are many fabrics that are are equal to Ventile and in some cases surpass it for a fraction of the costs.

&gt; # [Espa√±a moderniza los tanques de Venezuela pese al embargo de la UE - Runrun](https://runrun.es/noticias/367755/341)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Espa√±a participa en la modernizaci√≥n de los carros de combate del Ej√©rcito de Venezuela pese al embargo de armamento decretado por la UE. La junta interministerial que controla las exportaciones de material militar aprob√≥ en enero de 2018 la venta a Nicol√°s Maduro de repuestos para blindados por 20 millones de euros. La autorizaci√≥n por parte del Ejecutivo de Rajoy se produjo despu√©s de que, el 14 de noviembre de 2017, entrase en vigor el reglamento de la UE que proh√≠be suministrar dicho material a Caracas. Fuentes gubernamentales alegan que el contrato es anterior al embargo, aunque su aprobaci√≥n pol√≠tica fuera posterior.
&gt; 
&gt; Ante el deterioro de la democracia en Venezuela y la falta de respeto al Estado de derecho y a los derechos humanos por parte de Maduro, el Consejo Europeo aprob√≥, el 13 de noviembre de 2017, un embargo a Venezuela de armamento y material susceptible de ser utilizado para la represi√≥n, as√≠ como la congelaci√≥n de activos de una lista de altos cargos del r√©gimen bolivariano que luego se ha ido ampliando.
&gt; 
&gt; El reglamento, que entr√≥ en vigor un d√≠a despu√©s, prohib√≠a suministrar a Venezuela cualquier material incluido en la llamada Lista Com√∫n Militar de la Uni√≥n Europea, que cita expresamente los veh√≠culos terrestres dise√±ados o modificados para uso militar y sus componentes.
&gt; 
&gt; El embargo a Venezuela solo admite dos excepciones: el suministro de material con fines humanitarios o para operaciones de la ONU y organizaciones regionales; y ‚Äúla ejecuci√≥n de contratos celebrados antes del 13 de noviembre de 2017 o de contratos auxiliares necesarios para la ejecuci√≥n de los mismos‚Äù.

jamieandhisego,1393710304.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fich6,False,"These are pretty reasonable liberal interventions into the capitalist economy, but to call a country 'far left' when their leader is not a socialist is quite a stretch.

Luke Savage is quite good on this (among a lot of things): https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality

By American standards, Canada may appear 'left-wing', but by European standards, they're a welfare-state capitalist mixed economy, and these policies are regressions back to the centrist mean. I mean, these are policies that Angela Merkel would probably endorse, and she's a centre-right politician. For most of the developed world, there is a general acceptance amongst elites that in order for capitalism to function, it requires a social safety net to cater for the necessary levels of unemployment that free markets require (as they do not aim for full employment), and a state willing to intervene to ensure citizens are not thrown completely under the wheel of capital (e.g. universal healthcare, worker's rights- and historically speaking, no child labour, the existence of the weekend, etc.).

P.S. Obviously I would tie being left-wing to a combination of both social and economic positions, but it's worth noting that you could conceivably be an anarcho-capitalist white supremacist and think that marijuana should be legalised. 

P.P.S. A socialist would ban fracking and tax oil companies (maybe even nationalise them and turn them into public cooperatives and reorient investment into green energy), not add a carbon tax.

Thanks for any information!

Would you mind linking that again? Because I've seen plenty of people suggesting that Corbyn not wanting to share a platform with Cameron represented him 'sabotaging the campaign', when in reality the opposite is the case. 

&gt; However, if we want to avoid the dire consequences of a no deal Brexit the answer to your point is that he needs to talk to other opponents of Brexit (rather than just his exclusive brotherhood), understand what they will and won't back and then (as leader of the largest opposition party) use that understanding to inform his public position and discussions (which I am sure go on in private) with the EU officials.

But Labour *have* been working with the opposition parties. It was a cross-party motion which proposed a Vote of No Confidence against May's leadership before Christmas. The leadership have been whipping to support amendments by prominent critics of Corbyn (such as whipping to support Umunna and Soubry's joint ammendment to force the government to release their No Deal forecasts).

&gt; The migrants granted citizenship on Wednesday were named as: Jake Gani from Albania, and Ibrahim Mahmoud Mousa and Emad Al Haimi from Egypt.

&gt; Greece was at the epicentre of the EU&amp;#039;s migrant crisis in 2015-2016, when more than a million migrants reached Germany via the Balkans.

Also, 

&gt;Resolution 4 of the 2007 World Health Assembly resolution 60.17 urges member states to ‚Äúconsider the development and implementation of fluoridation programmes‚Äù [90]. This statement is a reflection of current realities that artificial water fluoridation is not necessarily the most economical, effective, or affordable way to deliver fluoride to teeth in the 21st century [8, 9].

is clearly taken in the wrong context... how the fuck does the author of this article think that the WHA urging the development and implimentation of programs is a reflection that it is NOT an effective way? (point 3 here)

oh... and your linked article right there? #30, which you have referenced multiple times across this post? 

https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/en/l-2/3.htm#0

here is a basic text summery for you... 

in case you dont want to read it, let me quote a few things for you

in regards to fluorosis in permanent teeth

&gt;However, the EFSA panel considered that an intake of less than 0.1 mg of fluoride per kilogram of body weight, per day, led to no significant incidence of ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù fluorosis in permanent teeth.

&gt;Fluorosis can occur in areas with fluoridated water, and also in those without. Fluoride supplements and use of fluoridated toothpaste, in large amounts, also increase the risk.

in regards to skeletal fluorosis

&gt;SCHER concludes that there is not enough data to evaluate the risk of bone fracture at the fluoride levels seen in areas with fluoridated water.

and in regards to cancer

&gt;On reviewing the most recent studies, the SCHER concludes that epidemiological work does not indicate a clear link between fluoride in drinking water and any cancers. Nor is there evidence from animal studies to support such a link. Fluoride should therefore be classified as non-carcinogenic.

in regards to Neuro Effects

&gt;The SCHER concludes that there is no clear evidence that fluoride in drinking water at concentrations permitted in the EU may reduce children‚Äôs IQ, and that there is no biological basis for thinking that this would occur.

in regards to reproduction

&gt;A few human studies have suggested that fluoride might affect reproductive hormones, but they are poorly designed for risk evaluation. SCHER concludes that fluoride in drinking water at concentrations permitted in the EU has no reproductive effects.

so... what else ya got?

Well, I don't know if this counts for much but making it 2 european finals (EL, then CL) shows me that we have a lot of experience in big matches, big moments, and a lot of the core of this team was there last season, or for both finals. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, Van Dijk has won a league with Celtic. 

Milner with City. 

Shaqiri with Bayern. 

Sturridge was around Chelsea when they've won. He also was here for our heartbreaking 13/14 season, as was Hendo. 

Robbo has been in a relegation and a promotion fight, and I think that experience is equally valuable. 

Keita was in a tightly contested Bundesliga fight a couple seasons back, central to it all. 

Fabinho has won a league with Monaco. 

Gini I believe captained PSV to a league title. 

and perhaps most importantly, Klopp has been here before twice, in similar circumstances: great team chasing him from behind, has to win. He's also been to so many important cup finals. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't love the narrative right now from the media that we absolutely need to win 14-15 matches to secure the league. Yes, mathematically that's the number (if we beat City). Yes that's what we should be striving for, but I don't think people should be asserting this as if either Spurs or City are going to win 17 on the bounce. So, if we do end up being able to beat city tomorrow, they'll be 10 points behind us with 17 matches to play. That means that if City win out their remaining 17 matches after Thursday, we would only NEED to win the 14 matches to guarantee a league (they have to play Spurs still, mind, meaning Spurs would be 12 points behind if City run 17 on the bounce). Flip side, if Spurs somehow end up winning 17 on the bounce, we'd still need at least 14 wins (we'd have to win on GD though). 

With all of this said, Spurs will lose whom I consider their most in form player atm (SON) for the Asian Cup until early/mid Feb and have an incredible number of high intensity matches during this period. From now until I assume Son will be back and playing (let's just assume \~Feb 14 as the final is Feb 5), Spurs will play Chelsea x2 in the league cup, United x 1 in the league, have an easy FA cup tie against Tranmere but one that should be won and will give them an extra match the around Jan 26th to contend with, and big matches against Watford (who look like they're able to pick up points off anyone on their day), and Fullham (who with Ranieri at the helm, are infinitely more dangerous given all the talent that they have). That would be 8 matches in Jan (already played Cardiff), 7 of which will be without Son. If Kane, Dele, Eriksen, or any of the CBs go down even with a muscular strain, they will have a crunch period like we just had in December. If Kane picks up his annual 2 or 3 week knock in Jan, they'd be absolutely SOL, with Llorente their only depth. This also doesn't take into consideration that February isn't much better for them as they have Chelsea in the league, Burnley (who despite their form, are always a challenge to break down and will play dirty, likely fighting for survival), Leicester who can pick up points off any of the big dogs, Newcastle who have been particularly resolute, and Dortmund. They also would have another FA cup match if they win the 4th round match. 

My take on their season at the moment is that they will go out for the league, league cup and if they make it past the 4th round with their fringe players in fa cup, with the immediate focus being the League Cup. Come away the winners against Chelsea in the semis, and all of sudden they are 1 match away from their first trophy in years. No doubt in my mind that Chelsea will be feeling the same as it gives Sarri a chance to win a trophy early on in his tenure (with basically no chance at the league, no champions league and Europa league becoming tricky with Napoli, Arsenal, Sevilla, Inter, Valencia, Frankfurt, and Villareal in the round of 32 still, all quality sides with experience in the tournament). United also are looking significantly more dangerous with their ""new manager bounce,"" so it's not ideal to play them so soon after Ole came in. So my take is that Spurs will not win out their remaining 17 matches, especially with 5 more 'big 6 matches' in the league alone, 7 if you include league cup, 8 if they make the league cup final, and more depending on who they draw in FA cup. We also can put a lot more daylight between them if we go out and beat Spurs at Anfield in March, which who would bet against us at least picking up a point there. 

City, on the other hand, will only have 4 ""big 6 matches"" left in the league. Spurs, Arsenal, Chelsea and United. They will play one of Chelsea/Spurs in the LC final, and most likely go all out for the victory there again. In the league, in Jan, they play Wolves (tricky tie for the big 6, they're pushing hard for a european place and look like they could do the damn thing), they are almost guaranteed another fa cup fixture after Rotherham, and play as well the resolute, resurgent Newcastle. February is where things start to get really tricky for them. Arsenal, Chelsea, Schalke, Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth (who are now infinitely less dangerous with all their injury luck), Watford, Schalke and United between Feb 3 - Mar 16. 41 days. At least 10 matches, more if they advance in FA Cup + League Cup. So \~12 matches in 41 days, and a squad that already looks slightly burnt out physically and psychologically. If it ends up 12 matches, that's a match every 3.4 days. I could see them having points taken off of them in at least 1, if not 2 of those matches from Feb 3 - March 16. If they lost 1 (lets say against Chelsea), draw 1 (say against Arsenal), that would knock them 5 further back of us assuming we can keep on winning. If we mirrored their results and win all of our fixtures bar 1 loss, 1 draw, that would mean all we would need is 12 wins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the point of all of this is to lay out clearly that all these are assumptions based on everyone winning the rest of their matches, which is impossible for all 3 to do. Too many big 6 matches, too many CL matches. The Tomkins Times did a study a few years back finding a strong correlation to a run in the CL (to Semis or further) equals \~10 points lost in the EPL. So, if Spurs get past Dortmund and City past Schalke, they are both very likely to drop additional points as they turn their focus towards the CL (post League Cup). As it stands right now, we have a relatively light Jan with 5 matches and our FA cup match is against Wolves. A win there, fine. A loss there, fine. Us missing out on the LC semis will be huge for us. We have so many things going in our direction currently. But we need to start with a win in league tomorrow against City. If we can win against City and go on and put full force into winning against Brighton (Away), Palace (Home), Leicester (Home), West Ham (Away) and Bournemouth (Home), we could very easily be closer to having a 12-15 point lead in the league. 72 points after 26 matches. Again, City losing 1 and drawing 1 and winning 3 during that same time period (remember, they play Chelsea, Arsenal, Wolves, Newcastle and HT) would give them 57 points. Spurs losing 1, drawing one (they play United, Fullham, Watford, Newcastle and Leicester in the league during that period) would give them 58 points. If this scenario unfolds in this way, I think the league will be wrapped up by mid-feb. Even if it isn't, City and Spurs still have to play each other and Spurs still have to play us. This match against City is about as important as the CL Final.

In the 60s and 70s more socialist programs where being pushed by unions successfully until their was a massive public backlash with multiple percents of the population marching against these programs (namely the wage earner funds).

Large companies like the founder of IKEA moved (he moved to Switzerland). In the 90s people where fed up with the failure of the economy. Regulations, taxes, union power, and other things where scaled back and free market principles where further embraced. The Swedish economy is one of the freest in the world. Massive amounts of those social programs where transfered to the private sector for management because the government (as usual) was incompetent. Most of the healthcare is privately provided. Taxes for healthcare was massively decentralized to much smaller units. Two-tier healthcare is available allowing people to purchase better care for more money. Half of Swedish high-schools are private and are paid via government vouchers and citizens aren't limited in what schools they can send their children.

Organizations like the RS ‚Äúnational‚Äù police force are notoriously corrupt and are often made up of ex-soldiers and smaller scale war criminals dating from the 90s. RS does have their own President and legislature based in Banja Luka and they can do a lot of their own things, but they‚Äôre still in BiH proper - so yes, they do fall under the national government.

2. Some of the ultranationalists in RS are certainly wishing for independence, but they can do little about it. Nobody wants a war killing at least another 100,000 people. They can talk about how they want to join Serbia all they want but it‚Äôs just a political headline at this point. If one wants to become a political hardliner it‚Äôs a necessary talking point.

At the same time, there‚Äôs definitely a group that doesn‚Äôt care about the name of the country they live in and is glad to be living in peace. Much of the younger generation (across all ethnicities) wants to be done with all this stuff. A large group of the population is unfortunately stuck where they are no matter what they want, as many of the poorest parts of BiH are located in RS, and there are many towns and areas with awful education, no jobs, no investment, and the like, and the RS government has shown little interest in changing that. Many of these people have nowhere to go, which is forgotten to many politicians who would rather reinforce nationalist talking points than work towards fixing things like the astronomical youth unemployment rate or working with war veterans to get them the services they need.

The political consensus was that President Trump needed to pass health care reform to be able to move forward with his legislative agenda. While this may be true, the passing of any repeal and replacement bill without fundamental reforms has little chance of long-term success, likely defining Trump‚Äôs presidency as a failure no matter how successful he is in other areas. The proposed replacement bill, the American Health care Act (AHA), offered no major changes to the fundamentals of one of the most bureaucratic, inefficient, rationed and corrupt health care delivery systems in the world.

The U.S. spends over $10,000 per capita on health care, more than twice the average of other developed countries, though consistently ranking among the least efficient in the world. Much of the excess cost is a consequence of trying to use an insurance model for routine care, which eliminates competition and consumer-driven cost controls. The U.S. far exceeds any nation in expenditures for insurance administration, where the essential means of cost control is denial of service and rationing of care via ever increasing complex treatment approval systems, resulting in spiraling costs. Insurance is designed to provide coverage for medical emergencies, not routine care. Insurance has never worked in any industry as a method of providing services that are used on a routine basis.


Both physicians and patients, Republicans and Democrats alike, agree that increased access to health care and consumer choice are two of the most important aspects of health care reform. Many feel, however, that these are essentially mutually exclusive goals-feeling that increasing patient access to care means becoming a more socialized system while increasing consumer choice requires a free-market system, sacrificing patient access. Fortunately, these are not mutually exclusive goals.

The misconception that the American health care system is a free market system and the European systems are socialized because they provide universal coverage are complete fallacies. The American health care system has less consumer choice and other free market principles than most every industrialized nation even though they are often referred to as socialized medicine. U.S.government (taxpayer) funded health care spending is the highest of any country in the amount spent per capita, as a percent of GDP and as the percent paid by government compared to 
private payments. At 65 percent, it exceeds any nation, including those with universal health care programs such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and France.

Countries vary dramatically in the degree of regulation, central control, cost sharing and the function of private insurance. However, overall trends from the different health care delivery systems demonstrate that:

The more heavily weighted the system is toward government control, the more likely the patients face significant restrictions on physician choice, long wait times, rationed care and other obstacles.
Having health insurance does not necessarily mean increased access to care, but instead rationed care with long wait times for treatment or services.
The more the health care system incorporates free-market mechanisms, such as competition, cost sharing (copays), transparency, consistent pricing for all goods and services, consumer choice with an incentive and ability to discern price and value of goods and services and rejection of government control, the more effective the health care system.
The U.S. system is very similar to the systems used in France and Switzerland, with both having one underlying significant difference from the U.S. ‚Äî more free-market mechanisms to maintain costs, including consumer choice, price transparency, fewer regulations and consistent cost-sharing (copays of 10 to 40 percent) to discourage overuse of services. The Swiss system has been considered an ideal model of socialized medicine, but there are no government run insurance plans and no public options. It is based on a managed competition model, which is essentially the basis of the U.S. system, with a few differences. One such difference is the requirement for everyone to purchase catastrophic insurance (there is no employer contribution), but government subsidies are offered to individuals to buy coverage from private insurers.

Additionally, most Swiss purchase a health savings account, giving the Swiss more consumer control than could ever be imagined in the U.S. Due to these consumer controls of health care purchasing and consistent cost-sharing, they pay 40 percent less for a comparable level of health care to the U.S., with consumers generally being responsible for 20 percent of the cost. A review of the Swiss health care system published in JAMA concluded, ‚ÄúCost control may be attributed to the Swiss consumer‚Äôs significant role in health care payments and the resulting cost transparency.‚Äù

Singapore is arguably the best health care system, ranked sixth in the world in the WHO Quality of Care and second only to Hong Kong in efficiency while paying about one-fifth of what Americans pay for health care. Often referred to as a socialized health care system because everyone is required to purchase a Health Savings Account (HSA), it is also the most free-market oriented system in the world, as patients are aware of costs and can use their HSA money to shop around for the best value for their health.

Unlike the U.S. system, the Singapore health care system promotes individual responsibility with significant incentives for patients to make health care choices that provide value while allowing market forces to improve service, increase efficiency and foster the development of patient options. Patients then purchase a high deductible insurance plan with their HSA money for significant unforeseen medical problems. The key to success of the system is the widespread use of HSAs, where consumers have ultimate control when combined with price transparency. In this country, most believe that free market competition entails having multiple insurance companies to choose from, which completely misses the entire concept of free market and will not have a significant lasting impact on health care costs.

The model that works in other countries, utilizing HSAs for routine care combined with a high deductible plan for emergency coverage, would work in the U.S. but would require market reform. Regulations would be needed that allow consumer choice, including price transparency, and prevent the grossly inflated arbitrary pricing of hospitals, laboratories and drug companies that are different depending on who is buying. Thus, requirements that those supplying the product or service post their prices and cannot charge different amounts to consumers based on insurance coverage or carrier will be needed.

In my communications with members of Congress, it seems clear that there is no incentive to reform health care and an unwillingness to take on powerful health care lobbies. One congressperson‚Äôs office responded with, ‚ÄúLong story short, we are screwed regardless of what legislation is passed ‚Ä¶‚Äù This sentiment seems to be common, in that they don‚Äôt believe or see a way to successfully reform health care or are unwilling to make the necessary reforms. If Congress is willing to put the health care of the American public above their concerns about making significant change to the current system, which can be risky when seeking re-election, dramatic improvement in the health care system is possible.

A free-market system is shown to be the only reasonable method of reform that addresses the true underlying problems of the U.S. health care system and effectively lowers health care costs, allowing for universal insurance coverage for most everyone so any reasonable person ‚Äî doctor, patient, Republican or Democrat ‚Äî could support.""

Health insurance was never meant to be for primary care, it was suppose to be be emergency purposes. In addition, when a health insurance company allows pre-existing conditions, they are no longer a health insurance company at that point, but a piggy bank. That's like having your house burn down, calling the fire insurance company, and then the next day having your house replaced. Do you know why X-rays are so expensive? It's because there isn't a free market in terms of x-ray machines- there are like two companies that make them (monopoly). Do you know why flu shots are so cheap? It's because there is a free market system based on competition and you can get a flu shot at many places i.e. Walgreens, WalMart, CVS, local mom and pop drug stores, Costco, etc.

Just because right wing narratives conflate social liberalism and social democracy with Stalinism doesn't make it real. 



Social liberalism is right centre liberal politics. 


And Social democracy is right in the centre of the spectrum and is based around the rejection of one party, totalitarianism seen in the Soviet Union.


&gt;Social democracy originated as a political ideology that advocated an evolutionary and peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism using established political processes in contrast to the revolutionary approach to transition associated with orthodox Marxism.[6] In the early post-war era in Western Europe, social democratic parties rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternative path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.[7] In this period, social democrats embraced a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential utilities and public services under public ownership. As a result, social democracy became associated with Keynesian economics, state interventionism and the welfare state, while abandoning the prior goal of replacing the capitalist system (factor markets, private property and wage labor)[4] with a qualitatively different socialist economic system.[8][9][10]

most european countries regulate the prices a bit indirectly, they do this by either owning the network (or major parts of it), and/or forcing the owners of equipment (the main ISPs for example) to lease out use of the equipment to other companies at a controlled price (a very small profit), as a way to enable competition.

FunkyPlaid,1469376981.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_zrtbk,False,"Before you seek a comprehensive answer to this question, it is important to qualify what we're talking about when we discuss the Jacobite movement in context. To be clear, historical Jacobitism is long-dead and shares little with the beliefs of self-professed modern 'Jacobites'. This latter group tends to be largely made up of insular, republican, conservative monarchists who pine for the 'glory days' of Divine Right rule while performing flaccid rituals (toasts, speeches) imbued with sorrowful emotion and 'lost cause' conditioning. Some have appropriated the visual, cultural, and symbolic mechanisms of historical Jacobitism to reinforce their modern, often atavistic beliefs, but I have rarely encountered a legitimist who has any real grasp of what the Jacobite cause actually represented to the people who espoused it during its hundred years of activity, roughly 1689-1789.

I have previously summarized the primary tenets of historical Jacobitism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4u7oho/was_the_1745_jacobite_uprising_primarily_a/d5pb0gs), so I won't fill this space with a repetition of it. But I would like to specifically address the issue of Scottish independence within the broader umbrella of the many Jacobite causes in the long eighteenth century. To put it plainly: Jacobitism did not equate to nationalism, which makes its appropriation today by independence-minded folks somewhat odd. While it is true that for some, support for the Stuarts signaled an alignment with rethinking ‚Äì not necessarily revoking ‚Äì the parliamentary Union of 1707, the regnal union of crowns was always going to be jointly ruled by James VIII/III if his son was successful in overthrowing the established Hanoverian government. When faced with widespread resistance from loyalist Britons (that's English *and* Scots) in and after 1745, Stuart doctrine justifiably promised pretty much anything that might attract a broad base of followers to get warm bodies on to the field ‚Äì including the dissolution of the parliamentary union for those who thought it might be a more promising option. The resistance to the Jacobite threat, however, was *also* made up of large numbers of Scottish patriots who thoroughly felt the union was beneficial for Scotland, even through its growing pains and admittedly uneven advantages. They also felt that Jacobites were by their very beliefs committing treason against their king and country. So we see that nationalism cuts both ways in this context.

To sum it up, taken from my linked post above: *""... independence-minded nationalist sentiment was a relatively small motivating factor in the bottom-up constituency of Jacobite supporters during the last rising. The Jacobite-Nationalist alignment has been subsequently force-fit due to the hot potato of the modern independence issue, and historical Jacobitism in the context of the eighteenth century has been distinctly misshapen by those in privileged positions who, in my opinion, should know better. This is certainly not a commentary on the viability of the nationalist agenda or the legitimacy of an independent modern Scotland, but a frustrated complaint that this vital issue should not be conflated with Jacobitism in a widespread historical tableau. They weren't and aren't the same things, however present a small degree of overlap.""*

Finally, to your question about what makes the Jacobite cause so enduring: as mentioned above, there is a distinct romanticism connected with the historical Jacobite movement, largely attributable to the 'fateful doom' or 'lost cause' character of that history seen through the antiseptic lens of the modern. It's true that horrible things were done to innocent people in the aftermath of Culloden, and those measures arguably strangled the last gasp of the feudalistic Highland clan system, perhaps already centuries out of its time. It's also true that terrible and particularly emotional things occur in civil wars, of which the Jacobite challenges were certainly a part. Brother against brother, pomp and tartanry, Bonnie princes and all that. The [symbology is indelible](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/jacobites) and was designed to be that way specifically to attract followers to the cause.

But why does it endure? It might be uncomfortable to ask the same question about the Confederacy in the American Civil War, but the answers, if not the causes, share a quality and the same ultimate fate: progressiveness won out versus restrictive, elitist atavism. There is a fine line between rebellion and revolution, that line being a simple matter of failure or success. Perspective and perception is essential, then, when we discuss terms like independence, loyalist, rebel, and patriot. But the grass remains ever greener on the What If? side...

**LTO Network splits the functionality into two layers.**

Layer 2 consists of ad-hoc [permissionless private chains](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/the-rise-of-private-permissionless-blockchains-part-1-4c39bea2e2be), each with their own workflow logic. Every Live Contract rests upon its own miniature chain, making for ad-hoc collaboration.

The logic in each miniature chain is defined as [Finite State Machine](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/video-how-finite-state-machine-helps-avoiding-bugs-and-stupid-mistakes-571f635618bb), which differentiates LTO Network from other side chain projects. This makes the logic in a Live Contract understandable for both humans and machines.

Each private chain is visible to and shared only with the participants that are supposed to be interacting in that particular Live Contract. This means that the number of participants on each chain is limited, as most legal contracts consist of only about a handful participants.

As a result, guaranteeing immutability on just the private chain itself is hard. This is where the public chain comes in (layer 1). Every event happening in layer 2 (or rather, the fact that an event happened, not the data itself) is being [hashed](https://medium.com/ltonetwork/legalthings-one-blockchain-gdpr-made-possible-68a5ce09e7ca) onto layer 1.

A hash is *a one-way function that converts one value to another*. When a document is hashed, a unique hash is generated, consisting of just digits and letters. Because hashing is a one-way function, the document itself can never be re-generated from just the hash.

In short, the private layer is for data sharing, process automation, and collaboration. The public layer, on the other hand, acts as a security settlement layer, like an immutable digital notary for hashes of layer 2 (a distributed hash table, of sort). This hybrid approach makes LTO Network GDPR and data privacy compliant, as well as extremely scalable.

&gt;So why would they move to an obscure  blockchain tech?

I would not say it is obscure, I would say that LTO is an evolvement of the blockchains out there and adapted to solve a problem in a client base that was already present (and has potential to grow enormously). From EU point of view not many blockchains are GDPR compliant, Ethereum certainly isn't, nor is Bitcoin, as hashing/encryption is not considered enough at this moment to be GDPR compliant. Which for the blockchains itself might not be such a big deal (they are decentralized, so who are you going to sue/fine???), but for companies that wish to use blockchain technology, it IS.

LTO won a EU ledger for waste transportation and ran a succesful pilot that saved the companies involved about 48% in internal costs per waste transportation, which at 500.000 transporations that were present in the pilot of several months equaled to about 36.000.000,- EURO in saved costs.

But your article says it is basically about race.   Your article supports the point you are arguing against.

&gt; After analyzing in-depth survey data from 2012 and 2016, the University of Pennsylvania political scientist Diana C. Mutz argues that it‚Äôs the latter. In a new article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, she added her conclusion to the growing body of evidence that the 2016 election was not about economic hardship.

&gt; ‚ÄúInstead,‚Äù she writes, *‚Äúit was about dominant groups that felt threatened by change and a candidate who took advantage of that trend.‚Äù*

&gt; ‚ÄúFor the first time since Europeans arrived in this country,‚Äù Mutz notes, *‚Äúwhite Americans are being told that they will soon be a minority race.‚Äù* When members of a historically dominant group feel threatened, she explains, they go through some interesting psychological twists and turns to make themselves feel okay again. *First, they get nostalgic and try to protect the status quo however they can. They defend their own group (‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù), they start behaving in more traditional ways, and they start to feel more negatively toward other groups.*

&gt; This could be why in one study, *whites who were presented with evidence of racial progress experienced lower self-esteem afterward. In another study, reminding whites who were high in ‚Äúethnic identification‚Äù that nonwhite groups will soon outnumber them revved up their support for Trump, their desire for anti-immigrant policies, and their opposition to political correctness.*

ihatereddit613,1469062941.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_zon48,False,"Nice rant, but some things really stood out to me. I don't particularly care what you believe, but there's clearly a superiority complex going on. You seem to think *you* and people who agree with you have all the right answers, and the *only* right answers.  It's almost like you've never met anybody you respected that you disagreed with. I'd argue it's clear that you haven't met enough people outside whatever circle you run in.

*on your general hate for middle America*

You literally believe they are a meme. That everything you think they are, they must be. I'm from one of your precious ""cultured"" left wing enclaves. I have more education than 97% of Americans (only 3.5% if Americans hold a professional degree or higher). I am not the least bit better than anybody else, regardless of education, especially a farmer out in god knows where. The fact that you truly believe *you* are better just because you are *cultured* and live in a metropolitan area is hilarious. What, you have an Indian restaurant down the block? You ate Ethiopian food last month? It's a sick joke. It must be easy to feel superior to ""rubes"" in middle America that you'll never have to meet and speak to, much less say these things to their faces. 

*on American values*

Ah, yes. *They* stand against American values but you want to adopt what amounts to European forms of government. Or am I wrong? If you knew anything about the founding of this country, you'd know a strong centralized federal power was the farthest thing from what was intended. But that's ok, if you say those evil right wing rednecks stand against everything America was founded on enough times it must be true. 

I'd actually agree that the Trump-clan do not stand for American values because they are barely conservative. They are populists at best and they are opposed to anything small government.

*on religion*

I love when people use the bible to argue politics. As a urbanite/suburbanite redditor, the odds that you are actually religious are so slim you can't be taken seriously. Were you religious, you would also know that the bible, like most religious texts, has conflicting direction with regard to many things, and certainly does not provide guidance on things like immigration or gun policy. But fuck it, atheists and agnostics telling religious people what the bible says is on par with islamophobes quoting the Koran as a sword to keep refugees out. Beautiful hypocrisy.

*on anti-vaxxers*

Studies on the topic of anti-vaxxers are conflicting, with some finding liberals more prone to distrust vaccines and other finding conservatives more prone. But most of the impacts of anti-vaxxers have been seen in blue states/areas. For example, that measles outbreak was in the wealthy and largely left wing Marin County, CA.  

&gt;Yet, the same is true for those on the left: compared to moderates, those who are very liberal are also one-and-a-half times more likely to believe vaccines are unsafe. It seems that it does not matter what your politics are, the more partisan, the more likely you believe vaccines are harmful.

Let's face it, who has more time to think about vaccines: the blue collar workers or a hippie in a drum circle?

warwick607,1369282344.0,,crim,[],,Criminal Justice/Criminology,dark,text,t2_bryls,False,"Here are some books that cover a wide-range of information on the topic of drugs and criminology.

* In [Policing the Globe](https://www.amazon.com/Policing-Globe-Criminalization-International-Relations/dp/0195341953), Peter Andreas and Ethan Nadelmann explain how and why prohibitions like the war on drugs practice increasingly extend across borders. They challenge the common belief that internationalization of crime control is too often described as simply a natural and predictable response to the growth of transnational crime in an age of globalization. Their answer describes the ambitious efforts by generations of western powers to export their own definitions of ""crime,"" not just for political and economic gain but also in an attempt to promote their own morals to other parts of the world. It's a great book.

* In [Illegal Drugs, Drug Trafficking and Violence in Latin America](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319731520) Marcelo Bergman analyzes the political, economic and social effects of the war on drugs over the last twenty years, mostly from the context of Latin America but also the USA, Canada, Europe and the Far East. He also explores how drug-trafficking routes into Europe and the USA are developed, why the so-called drug cartels exist in the region, what level of profits illegal drugs generate, how such gains are distributed among producers, traffickers, and dealers, how much they make, why violence spread in certain places but not in others, and which alternative policies were taken to address the growing challenges posed by illegal drugs. Another great book.

* Finally, I recommend [Drug Use and Abuse: A Comprehensive Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Drug-Use-Abuse-Comprehensive-Introduction/dp/1305961544/ref=asc_df_1305961544/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312400961658&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=3783915779629953514&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002245&amp;hvtargid=pla-570030254585&amp;psc=1) by Howard Abadinsky. Although it's a textbook, it's very broad and easy read. It can answer any question you have related to drugs, drug laws, drug addiction, types of drugs and their effects, the history of drug use and laws, the various psychological and sociological theories behind drug use, domestic and international drug control, drug trafficking and ""narcoterrorism"", and alternatives to the drug war, or anything else you think of. This would be a good place to look if you wanted to know something specific and could reference a certain chapter or author for more information. I use it for my class and my students say it's not too bad of a read either.

&gt; 
&gt; El jueves 10 de enero del 2019 se espera la juramentaci√≥n de **Nicol√°s Maduro** para lo que ser√≠a su segundo periodo presidencial 2019-2025. Sin embargo, muchas son las interrogantes que envuelven este escenario pol√≠tico en el que por primera vez, un presidente de Venezuela podr√≠a no juramentarse en la Asamblea Nacional.
&gt; 
&gt; Para la elecci√≥n del Presidente 2019-2025, se organizaron unos comicios el 20 de mayo de 2018. Los diputados que conforman la mayor√≠a opositora en la AN aprobaron un acuerdo en el que declararon que las elecciones del 20M eran ‚Äúinexistentes‚Äù y anularon la proclamaci√≥n de Maduro.

&gt; Para Gustavo Linares Benzo, experto constitucionalista, las elecciones del 20 de mayo son nulas ‚Äìaunque las hubiese ganado la oposici√≥n- porque las convoc√≥ la asamblea constituyente y porque no se hicieron a finales de a√±o. **Por lo tanto, el 10 de enero de 2019, ante la falta absoluta, la Primera Magistratura debe ser asumida por el presidente de la Asamblea Nacional (AN), quien tiene la obligaci√≥n de convocar nuevas elecciones en 30 d√≠as. As√≠ lo establece la Constituci√≥n.**
&gt; 
&gt; Pero, aunque la oposici√≥n cuenta con la legalidad que le otorgo la Constituci√≥n, no cuenta con las instituciones democr√°ticas, y las fuerzas militares que se apeguen a la Constituci√≥n, para hacer cumplir con lo establecido en la Carta Magna.
&gt; 
&gt; Sin embargo, linares Benzo, advierte que la Sala Constitucional del TSJ se encargar√° de crear el piso legal para permitir que Maduro contin√∫e en Miraflores despu√©s del 10 de enero, y para dejar a un lado la Carta Magna.
&gt; 
&gt; Otro escenario dio a conocer recientemente el periodista Nelson Bocaranda, quien revel√≥ que el Gobierno tendr√≠a planteado realizar la juramentaci√≥n del presidente Nicol√°s Maduro pautada para el 10 de enero no ante la ANC como se ha anunciado en d√≠as previos sino ante el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia.
&gt; 
&gt; Hasta la fecha, m√°s de 40 pa√≠ses ‚Äìal menos los 28 miembros de la Uni√≥n Europea y los que integran el Grupo de Lima- podr√≠an cortar o reducir al m√≠nimo sus relaciones diplom√°ticas con el Gobierno de Venezuela si Maduro sigue en la Presidencia despu√©s del 10 de enero. Ese ‚Äúreducir al m√≠nimo‚Äù puede tener varias implicaciones pr√°cticas que est√°n por verse; una de las m√°s graves ‚Äìpor la migraci√≥n de venezolanas y venezolanos-.
&gt; 
&gt; Carlos Mezones, articulista del portal web aporrea.com asegur√≥ que la realidad nacional es que en ese d√≠a no pasara nada. La relaci√≥n de fuerzas con respecto a la oposici√≥n no la favorece. Esta no ha logrado reagruparse como para lanzar un ataque bestial que empa√±e la toma de posesi√≥n del segundo mandato del Presidente Maduro y haga temblar los cimientos del gobierno. No hay dudas que el pa√≠s seguir√° su rumbo esperando un acuerdo nacional o pol√≠ticas econ√≥micas acertadas para salir de la crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; El presidente de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente (**ANC), Diosdado Cabello, desestim√≥ que la dirigencia opositora pretenda desconocer el mandato que asumir√° el presidente Nicol√°s Maduro el pr√≥ximo 10 de enero.**
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúNo basta que destituyeron a Nicol√°s como 20 veces, lo juzgaron, le metieron 18 a√±os, le declararon ausencia absoluta, llamaron a elecciones y ahora la cosa es el 10 de enero ¬øQui√©n les va a creer?‚Äù, recalc√≥.
&gt; 
&gt; El tambi√©n primer vicepresidente del Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) afirm√≥ que el liderazgo revolucionario estar√° junto al pueblo acompa√±ando la toma de posesi√≥n del primer mandatario nacional. ‚ÄúY el que quiera chocar que le d√©, ah√≠ vamos a estar nosotros en la calle, las calles son del pueblo y no de la burgues√≠a‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; **El protagonista**
&gt; 
&gt; Maduro asegur√≥ en una de sus √∫ltimas Cadenas Nacionales durante el 2018 que terminaba su primer periodo mandando. ‚Äú**El 10 de enero empiezo 6 a√±os de construcci√≥n del socialismo. Me han tirado con todo, hasta una bomba me lanzaron con un drone y no me pudo hacer nada, estamos sagrados y protegidos**‚Äù, dijo.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúEstoy terminando el per√≠odo constitucional que me dej√≥ el Comandante Ch√°vez y lo estoy haciendo mandando, compadre, con el pueblo, con la Uni√≥n C√≠vico-Militar. Pueblo a la calle, pueblo al poder‚Äù, expres√≥ Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Lo cierto es que son inc√≥gnitas las pr√≥ximas acciones del presidente, ¬øqu√© suceder√° el 10E? Las decisiones, el temple, el valor y la sabidur√≠a tendr√°n el protagonismo de un hecho que marcar√° la historia pol√≠tica de nuestro pa√≠s.

Before the German invasion Polish Jews were obviously Polish and treated with the same equal rights as any other Polish citizen. Before the German invasion, Poland has long been a liberal country that embraced religious freedom and never indulged in dumb shit like the colonisation of Africa or other ethnic crimes. There were no mass atrocities that happened to Jews in Poland before the German invasion because like I said they were Polish just like anyone else in Poland and treated with equal respect regardless of Religion.

Obviously during the German invasion, Polish people were forced to partake in the Holocaust because we were losing the war and if the common people failed to abide by Germany's Nazi politics their lives were threatened. Many Polish people risked everything by helping their Polish Jewish friends hide. Many non Jewish Polish people were sent to die in concentration camps along with the Jews. It was not only a crime against Polish Jews but against Poland altogether.

The Polish police you speak of was actually ""milicja"" instead of ""policja"" - milicja was ruled entirely by the Russians and they commited a lot of unforgivable crimes against Polish people of all religious backgrounds, including Jews but not exclusively Jews.

I think what you're failing to understand is the extent of those foreign invasions and just how deeply they infiltrated into Poland's Politics. However they were not ""Polish politics"", they were foreign politics enforced in Poland which makes a huge difference.

To make this a little clearer: all of this era, from the German invasion right up until 1991 was a form of war against Poland. Why would any government in their right mind commit such crimes against their own people; whether they're  Jewish, Christian or Atheist? They wouldn't. Poland gained literally nothing from this shitshow. It was all a terrible thing that happened just because brainless fucktards invaded us.

Polish people are some of the friendliest nations in the World. Yes, there is a lot of casual racism in Poland but that's where it ends. I guarantee that in most Polish homes (unless obviously you meet some crazy people - every country has them) a foreigner of any background would receive a very warm welcome. There are of course places you shouldn't go to in Poland but these places are dangerous equally to foreigners as they are to locals and they exist as a direct result of the poverty caused by Russian &amp; German invasion.

&gt;In modern day it has one of the worst reputations in europe for antisemitism

Tbh, I've never experienced as much xenophobia anywhere else as I did in England. Some of the headlines that I've read about myself in English papers are disgustingly crazy , they're such lies and I can't believe it's legal to print this shit but do I go around calling all the English xenophobes? Nope. I have loads of English friends. Like I'm not sure what's going on in England these days but with the rise of anti-foreign attitudes in your politics, you're not doing much better in terms of ""tolerance"" than Poland lol. And we certainly dont print anti-Semitic shit in our papers like the xenophobic propaganda you guys publish about the Polish in yours, so take a good look at what's going on in your own country before criticising mine.

The Generalplan Ost (German pronunciation: […°en…ôÀà ÅaÀêlÀåplaÀên Àà…îst]; English: Master Plan for the East), abbreviated as GPO, was the Nazi German government's plan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale, and colonization of Central and Eastern Europe by Germans. It was to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. The plan was partially realized during the war, resulting directly and indirectly in the death of 9.4 to 11.4 million ethnic Slavs by starvation, disease, execution or extermination through labor, including 4.5 million Soviet citizens, 2.8 to 3.3 million Soviet POWs, 1.8 to 3 million Slavic Poles, 300 to 600 thousand Serbs and 20 to 25 thousand Slovenes. Its full implementation, however, was not considered practicable during the major military operations, and was prevented by Germany's defeat.The plan entailed the enslavement, expulsion, and mass murder of most Slavic peoples (and substantial parts of the Baltic peoples, especially Lithuanians and Latgalians) in Europe along with planned destruction of their nations, whom the 'Aryan' Nazis viewed as racially inferior. The program operational guidelines were based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in fulfilment of the Drang nach Osten (drive to the East) ideology of German expansionism.

**Hunger Plan**

The Hunger Plan (German: der Hungerplan; der Backe-Plan) was a plan developed by Nazi Germany during World War II to seize food from the Soviet Union and give it to German soldiers and civilians; the plan entailed the death by starvation of millions of ""racially inferior"" Slavs following Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. The premise behind the Hunger Plan was that Germany was not self-sufficient in food supplies, and to sustain the war and keep up the domestic morale it needed to obtain the food from conquered lands at any cost. It was an engineered famine, planned and implemented as an act of policy. This plan was developed during the planning phase for the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) invasion and provided for diverting of the Ukrainian food stuffs away from central and northern Russia and redirecting them for the benefit of the invading army and the population in Germany.

We met through friends and hit it off immediately, we talked alone for more than 12 hours the first time we met.  She was awesome and we got along better than any of my other GFs.  We got some shit from people, but not at all what I expected.

Weirdly, old people (white and asian alike) treated us super nice, with little note of race past comments about extremely good looking babies.  However, young white women from our ostensibly super-liberal school gave us the NASTIEST looks, and would glare at us for extended periods when we were out at cafes and stuff.  It happened A LOT, far more than anytime I've been out with a white girl and got glares out of jealousy or whatever.  Sometimes American girls (of several races) even ranted at me about ‚Äúsexual colonialism‚Äù and ‚ÄúChina Doll race fetishization‚Äù, for literally mentioning nothing more than the fact that my GF was from Asia.  It was beyond gross and ironically was super racist on their parts because OF COURSE she must be a demure mindless doll and OF COURSE I must be a world-marauding penile barbarian.  [NOTE:  this was before the stereotype of the ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù existed but was one of schools that gave it birth, so at the time this kind of stuff from people claiming to be ‚Äúanti-racists‚Äù was an enormous surprise]

Also, Asian students from Asia thought it was neat that we were going out or just didn't care, but I did meet some US-raised Asian boys and girls who took issue with us being an interracial couple.  I guess those inclinations grew into a dedicated hategroups on reddit that specializes in hating on the specific racial pairing discussed herein.  SO that's a thing.

\-Zionists are not real Jews as in Judaism.

\-People of all sorts of faiths and ethnicities have been living centuries peacefully together with each other, sometimes even marrying of each other and what not in the Middle East for example.

There is a lot of evidence for this. For example the Jewish community and history in Iran.

There are numerous problems with this. The first is that all of her known ancestors are white and white people aren't indigenous to Oklahoma. It doesn't make sense for her (or anyone) to think that hundreds of years ago there could have been a Native American ancestor in Europe. The timeline doesn't make sense. When we start talking about having tens of thousands of percent DNA then just being in Oklahoma recently where there are Indians present doesn't suggest native ancestry. 

The other problem is just the basic lack of common sense. She shouldn't claim to be an oppressed people when she doesn't share any experiences or traits with those people. 


Furthermore, she made a bigger mistake by making her native claims a part of her public image. It would be one thing to simply think you are Native American and tell people when asked but she went as far as to submit fake Native American recipes (that include mayo of all things) to publications.

They hated you before israel and will hate you long after it is gone.

Plus arab support of Nazi Germany directly with men like haj amin Husseini. There is no single excuse that justifies the current treatment israel by the left. Liberal Jews stateside are being misled by your kind nature, Jews have historically been supporters of progressive movements from helpjng found the NAACP to the anti apartheid movement in south Africa.

Which is why liberal Jewish college kids raised to uphold traditional cultural and religious values that incentives a empathetic understanding of others and due to a history of being a repressed minority it's nearly impossible for a jewish american or Jew in western europe going to a college campus like Berkley and being told that israel is evil is hard to disagree with it.

It's an insidious proposal that has been planned by the arab world for over 60 years, from the name change post 67 to the effort to turn islam a cruel backwards religion more in common with christian evangelicalism and far right conservatism into a liberal bullshit religion of oppressed brown people is amazing.

We got feminist supportive of regimes that oppress women because on the opposite front Trump and bannon are banning them. Then we have Netanyahu making a deal with the evangelical devil that thinks Jews have to die for jesus return.

All the while white college kids with parents who once gladly lynched Jews riding on the freedom buses for civil rights have the audacity to criticize Jews for defending the only jewish nation against arab imperialism. I'm black and a Zionist, i understand where Jews rationalization comes from but i will never support the attack on Israel.

For all it's racism, bigotry and hatred israel js ten times above the US under republicans when it comes to race relations. I mean fuck Arabs kill kindergarteners and celebrated it with monunents yet they still somehow end up in jail instead of killed.

Black men get murdered in our own homes and we can't get white people to agree okay maybe we have a race issue.

Mods ban anyone who contradicts what their bosses agenda is, including professors of international relations like myself. We‚Äôve been conducting research on the spread of false information and weaponization of ideology through social media platforms for over 4 years now with a large focus on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. There is three of us from my university that study Reddit currently and try to see what lines can and cannot be crossed on subs such as this one and worldnews to get a grasp on how diligently the paid mod teams are working to remove real information and people who do not follow their bosses agenda. The team working on Facebook had a hay day with the 2016 US election, and it brought it into perspective of just how easily these things can slip past the grasp of a purely public based moderation. 

Shills with bot armies run Reddit now, though at this point they are likely not needed anymore. Duped individuals are a massive portion of the Reddit community now, and they‚Äôre beginning to make up a good portion of university students now as well who happen to be causing serious issues for professors who refuse to stray away from anything but facts.

I think that one of the deep problems in American politics is the fact that the ""centre"" is way off to the right compared with both many European countries, and American political history (Eisenhower would probably be classed as some sort of socialist today, &amp; FDR would probably be labelled a communist). 

This results in unfortunate comparisons being drawn between politicians on the American ""left"" and other politicians from different places or times working in different contexts.

This is obviously only a problem because of failures in the education system which may or may not be features rather than bugs. 

It's certainly the case in the UK that Brexit is largely attributable to a profound failure of the education system, e.g. people thinking that [the fictitious ¬£350 million per week](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) is a lot of money, when in fact ¬£18 billion is really quite a small amount of money in the context of total public spending of [about ¬£800 billion per year](https://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/), even before we consider the fact that this was the gross figure, &amp; quite a lot of it actually came back anyway. If we use the real figure of about ¬£9 billion out, then it's about 1% of spending, &amp; the whole thing is ridiculous; we probably *already* lost more than that in growth forgone due to Brexit uncertainty.

zazzlekdazzle,1299284041.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4x68b,False,"It depends on where I am living. In the Netherlands, I never really saw or felt regular antisemitism as it's described (or I've experienced) elsewhere. I think people are a bit bashful about letting most of us get exterminated (though no one alive now could possibly have been involved), but Jews have been around for so long we're pretty integrated into the culture and there is a long history of ""live and let live"" with religious minorities. In fact, until there started being trouble with the Muslim population, I never saw anything that I would consider the sort of intolerance of anything like what I see and hear about elsewhere. This is not to say Dutch people aren't assholes, just in a different way.

When I lived in the UK, despite the place teeming with members of the tribe, I could not believe how many really educated people (I was on a fellowship at a university there) really didn't know anything about Jews. There was a menorah in the middle of town in December and I had someone with a PhD ask me what that thing was. I had, also very educated people, say, 'Oh, I always wanted to ask, why are you people so *tribal*?' And things like that. It was almost always a conversation stopper if I brought it up, and I was advised by local Jews to not mention to anyone unless it was necessary. I hardly felt persecuted, but the reason I didn't stay at that job is it just felt too weird being Jewish there.

In Quebec, I had to deal with some real-deal Jewish hate. There has been a culture war there among the Anglo Jews and the Francophone Quebecois for some time, and it has a taken its toll. It's too bad because I really loved Quebec and Quebecois culture and was actually quite sympathetic to their need to preserve their language and identity immersed in another culture. I am about 50% sure I didn't get a certain job at a Francophone university there because I am Jewish, but other than that it was just the usual meeting someone at a party saying they didn't like Jews but a good discussion usually brought them around.

In the US, it's just the garden variety stuff - people assume I'm rich and just have some magic mojo for success, but it doesn't feel like a compliment. Although I'm Dutch, my family is actually Sephardic so I look way more Southern rather than Nothern European, and people really like telling me they can tell I'm Jewish just by looking at me, and I find that makes me uncomfortable.  There is a weird feeling in the US now that both the political right and the political left don't like the Jews very much, and that's sort of a yucky feeling, like it's just not safe in that way. I recently read an article in the New York Times about anti-semitism in the Women's March organization (one I participate in) that really made me feel uncomfortable. I just feel like I need to keep my opinions mostly to myself.

1. A large network of instances, mostly based in the U.S. and Europe, where moderators enforce rules against racist, sexist, and homophobic speech. Several of the largest instances are hosted in France or Germany and are subject to those countries' laws against Nazi propaganda.
2. A small network of instances that permit all or almost all text and images that are legal in the United States, including racist, sexist, and homophobic speech. Many instances in network (1) have silenced or suspended (blocked) these instances.
3. A handful of instances in Japan, some of them very large, which have been suspended, silenced, or media silenced by most other Fediverse instances because Japan has different laws and norms about pornography.

The culture of network (1) is what most people mean when they talk about the culture of the Mastodon network. Though network (1) is united in rejecting racist speech, etc., on other issues, different instances have different moderation policies, and somehow it works out. Most notably, different instances have different policies about legal pornography and other NSFW images. 

The option of putting content warnings (CWs) on posts plays a key role in getting instances with different policies to federate together well. So does the ability for one instance to media silence another instance without blocking it completely.

I agree with @See46 that the Fediverse is a game changer. Yes, there is some content that has been effectively excluded from the mainstream network.

Correct.

Attempting to solve a crisis caused by his own incompetence is not something that  yields merit.

 Momentos decisivos na hist√≥ria s√£o raros e o Brasil acabou de entrar num deles. A elei√ß√£o de Bolsonaro foi s√≥ a prepara√ß√£o para o que vem agora: um Pa√≠s que, se quiser sair da mediocridade e estagna√ß√£o, ter√° de confrontar a si mesmo.

 O novo presidente prometeu libertar o Brasil de amarras que levaram gera√ß√µes para serem confeccionadas. E que podem ser resumidas numa constata√ß√£o preocupante: a sociedade brasileira falhou na tentativa de construir um Estado de bem-estar social nos moldes de pa√≠ses europeus. Nossa gera√ß√£o de riquezas n√£o comporta um Estado de bem-estar social com o qual sonhamos.

 Criamos um marco regulat√≥rio e legal que √© um verdadeiro compendio de aspira√ß√µes sociais, e que atribui ao Estado distribuir e garantir essas benesses e direitos codificados em leis. Esse papel garantiu a explos√£o de custos do setor p√∫blico que financiamos atrav√©s de aumentos de impostos nos √∫ltimos 30 anos (agora no n√≠vel do insuport√°vel) e endividamento (beirando tamb√©m o insuport√°vel). Tudo junto mais a baixa produtividade s√£o o famoso ‚Äúcusto Brasil‚Äù, que torna o Pa√≠s pouco competitivo.

 O principal desafio de curto prazo √© conhecido: lidar com as contas p√∫blicas, o que significa reformar a Previd√™ncia. Os principais obst√°culos pol√≠ticos s√£o bem conhecidos tamb√©m. Bolsonaro tomou posse gra√ßas a uma onda transformadora de amplo alcance e ra√≠zes profundas (ainda que em parte disfar√ßadas pelo rep√∫dio ao petismo). O ‚Äúmandato‚Äù conferido por esse fen√¥meno pol√≠tico para ‚Äúdefender a liberdade‚Äù, ‚Äúacabar com corrup√ß√£o e privil√©gios‚Äù e ‚Äúfazer o Brasil crescer‚Äù √© amplo para funcionar como inspira√ß√£o, mas precisa ganhar contornos pr√°ticos e diretos imediatamente.

 A combina√ß√£o dos dois discursos de Bolsonaro no dia da posse √© elucidativa. Ele reconhece que precisa do Congresso para governar e preferiu n√£o esbravejar com o Legislativo ‚Äì ao contr√°rio, confia em velhas m√£os (leia-se Rodrigo Maia como presidente da C√¢mara). Mas continua tratando de galvanizar o eleitorado como forma de manter a ‚Äútemperatura‚Äù pol√≠tica necess√°ria para, eventualmente, lidar numa posi√ß√£o de for√ßa com os senhores legisladores. N√£o parece que haver√° em breve qualquer grande separa√ß√£o entre ‚Äúpalanque‚Äù e ‚Äúgoverno‚Äù.

 Ocorre que h√° sempre um limite para o n√≠vel de ebuli√ß√£o e efervesc√™ncia pol√≠ticas e o capital acumulado em termos de votos na recente elei√ß√£o √© erodido pelo tempo, que n√£o √© o cronol√≥gico. √â o tempo da consagrada express√£o alem√£ do ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù, a r√°pida conjun√ß√£o de fatores estruturais e circunstanciais que abrem √†s vezes oportunidades √∫nicas para alcan√ßar objetivos amplos e dif√≠ceis.

 Claro, seria muito mais elegante e refinado reescrever a Constitui√ß√£o (quem sabe tornando-a liberal) ou realizar uma ampla reforma pol√≠tica (a m√£e de todas as reformas), mas isso significaria perder o ritmo e se deixar sufocar pelo peso monstruoso da crise fiscal, que j√° est√° paralisando servi√ßos essenciais de sa√∫de e seguran√ßa em v√°rios Estados. O Brasil n√£o √© um pa√≠s com mentalidade predominantemente liberal. Ao contr√°rio: aqui a burocracia √© encarada por muitos como prote√ß√£o e n√£o como obst√°culo. O lucro √© visto como pecado, e se algu√©m ficou rico √© porque algu√©m ficou pobre.

 O ‚Äúponto de equil√≠brio‚Äù entre mudan√ßa e ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù no qual nos encontramos √© o da instabilidade pol√≠tica, inseguran√ßa jur√≠dica, estagna√ß√£o econ√¥mica e mediocridade generalizada. Momento decisivo √© empurrar o Pa√≠s para fora disso a√≠. Oportunidades desse tipo n√£o se apresentam muitas vezes. E que ironia da Hist√≥ria: cabe agora a um outro conjunto de for√ßas pol√≠ticas entoar o velho refr√£o ‚Äì ‚Äúquem sabe faz a hora, n√£o espera acontecer‚Äù.

A 48DD is meant for a bust of 131.5 cm / 52 inches combined with an underbust of 48 inches. Due to the band being a bit too large, it can stretch about 3 inches extra. That combined with flesh being squishy is why she can close the 48DD bra. 

I suspect that the main reason they gave her 48DD is because most stores do not stock any larger cups than DD past a 42 band. 

Doing some alternate manual calculations I think her cupsize is most likely around EU 115G, which would be UK 50F. However that is going to be too loose with her underbust measurements. Sistersizing this down I get 48FF and 46G. 46G would be US 46i in Goddess and 46H in Lane Bryant Cacique or EU 105i in EU brands. Other brands that make bras in this size range are Elila (Elila runs large), Glamorise (very tricky fit, their bras are tall and shallow shaped like pizza plates), Ulla Dessous (EU sized), Gaia Linea Maxima. 

If you are in the USA, my recommendation would be to get the Elila 1803 (since she wants padded) and the Goddess Keira or Kayla in US 46K and US 46i and work from there. If you can afford it, throw in the Panache Sculptresse ChiChi in UK 46GG and maybe the Elila 2311 in UK 46J. All bras are available on amazon.

I think that an MBA is certainly a qualification you won't regret, it does depend on your goals though and what you really want out of it. Certainly, I have come across a lot of CIOs and other senior execs with an MBA - it gives them a really rounded skill set which helps when also dealing with other parts of the business (HR, Finance, strategy etc.) Doing an MBA will help you get through to the interview stage for roles - it helps you stand out from the other pack of CVs and applications. Networking is also a really important part of the MBA. You will walk out with a set of people you didn't know before who are all working towards bigger and better things and lots of great things can come from that.

It is a big investment of time but if you like learning and want to really open yourself up to new opportunities it can open up all sorts of doors - you will walk away knowing a whole lot more than you did across a full range of subjects and you will be able to apply that practical knowledge directly in the workplace!

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he done for me?‚Äù Trump said.

And Trump, who did not serve in the military and received draft deferments during the Vietnam War, suggested he would have made a good military leader himself.

‚ÄúI think I would have been a good general, but who knows?‚Äù Trump said.

He took credit for falling oil prices, arguing they were the result of phone calls he made to the leaders of oil-producing nations.

‚ÄúI called up certain people, and I said let that damn oil and gasoline ‚Äî you let it flow, the oil,‚Äù he said.

He described the recent stock sell-off as a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and said markets would soar again on the strength of trade deals he plans this year....

And Trump defended his push to fund his promised border wall, parrying complaints from Democrats who have called the wall immoral by remarking, ‚ÄúThen we have to do something about the Vatican, because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all.‚Äù ...

He said he stayed in Washington because the border security debate was ‚Äútoo important a subject to walk away from.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was here on Christmas evening. I was all by myself in the White House ‚Äî it‚Äôs a big, big house ‚Äî except for the guys on the lawn with machine guns,‚Äù he said. ...

Amid concerns within his own party about whether he will pull troops out of Afghanistan, Trump offered a discursive and somewhat inscrutable account of the fall of the Soviet Union, blaming it on the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

‚ÄúRussia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan,‚Äù Trump said.

His point was that the United States should pull out of hopeless and expensive wars, but he skipped over the many reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as he held up the loss of empire as an example.

The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there,‚Äù he said, breaking with the stance taken by past U.S. administrations that the invasion was an illegitimate power play against a neighboring nation. ‚ÄúThe problem is, it was a tough fight. And literally they went bankrupt; they went into being called Russia again, as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot of these places you‚Äôre reading about now are no longer part of Russia, because of Afghanistan.‚Äù ...

 Mattis‚Äôs formerly prominent place at the Cabinet table was occupied Wednesday by a little-known deputy, Patrick Shanahan, who mostly looked down at his notes as Trump called Syria, where more than 2,000 U.S. troops are deployed, a lost cause of ‚Äúsand and death.‚Äù ...

Several officials in attendance interjected praise for the president at different points.

‚ÄúI want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security,‚Äù Pence told him.

Trump, *a large poster of himself evoking ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù on the table before him*, complained about allies and partners from Afghanistan and Pakistan to India and Germany. They don‚Äôt pay their way or expect too much from the United States, Trump said, claiming anew that he is insisting on a reboot of the old expectations about U.S. aid and military obligations.

He claimed that if he wanted to, he could have any government job in Europe and be popular there. He cast his unpopularity among European publics as a sign he is doing his job well.

He defended his controversial negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by stating that if he had not reached out, there would have been a ‚Äúbig fat war in Asia.‚Äù ...

The president, who frequently faces criticism for his light public schedule, also bemoaned the lack of credit he has received for what he views as the many accomplishments of his first two years.

‚ÄúI have to tell you, it would be a lot easier if I didn‚Äôt do anything, if I just sat and enjoyed the presidency, like a lot of other people have done,‚Äù Trump said. ]

I'll say this, Trump is certainly not low energy... he's High Energy Idiot.

But then again, working for Trump everyday is another deeper level

Your first airsoft gun is the most important purchase you will make in airsoft. As your only weapon it must be **versatile**, **reliable**, **affordable**, reasonably high-performance, easy to work on, and compatible with as many accessories and upgrades as possible. This means buying an Automatic Electric Gun ('AEG') assault rifle or Sub-Machine Gun ('SMG'); **forget about sniper rifles, pistols, gas guns and other restrictive exotica** until you have more money, more experience, and at least one backup weapon.

System Component | Comment
---|---
Primary Weapon | An AEG assault rifle or SMG.
Magazine | A high-capacity ('hi-cap') magazine can replace numerous medium-capacity ('mid-cap') magazines, and many AEGs are supplied with one. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'.
Battery | You should have at least two. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'.
Battery Charger | You may also need a battery tester/balancer.

Again, most airsoft sites will rent you a weapons system, so you don't need to purchase your own until you're ready to commit to airsoft.

Which model of airsoft gun you purchase depends, in decreasing order of importance, on your **budget**, your **location**, and your **preference**. It is important that you understand that small budgets force you to choose from the small range of affordable guns that are not absolutely terrible. We will always recommend that you purchase the best gun that your budget will allow, rather than the cheapest gun that you can get away with: in airsoft, you get what you pay for. Good intermediate guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than budget or beginner alternatives. Your location may impose rules, or affect pricing, in a way that makes one gun better than the other. Your preference will be the choice between the guns that best fit your budget and location.

Commonly recommended choices include:

Make &amp; Model | Approximate Price | Comment
---|---|----
CYMA TM-Clone AK | $100 | CYMA's CM028 and CM028S are clones of the original TM AK-47 and AKS-47, and include a hi-cap magazine. These are the cheapest AEG we recommend, and are generally considered reliable, upgradeable, and reasonably versatile. However, their all-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ('ABS') plastic construction makes them relatively fragile. For improved robustness we strongly recommend spending slightly more to purchase a Glass-Filled Nylon Polymer ('GFP') AR-15 or a steel AK. To see a loadout built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot budget loadout'.
CYMA VFC-Clone AK | $150+ | CYMA's VFC-clone AKs are generally considered reliable, reasonably robust, and good value for money. AKs are generally tougher than AR-pattern alternatives. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an LCT or E&amp;L AK. For more information on loadouts built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot noob ak loadout'.
G&amp;G [Combat Machine AR-15](http://guay2.com/en/product-3-15-14-1) | $140+ | G&amp;G's CM16s are the gold standard of beginner airsoft guns. Built from a surprisingly tough GFP, CM16s are reliable, affordable, accessible and therefore absolutely ubiquitous. If possible, purchase one without G&amp;G's somewhat unreliable electronic trigger control system. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Classic Army Polymer AR-15 | $185+ | Classic Army's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to a slightly upmarket version of G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Tippman Commando | $160+ | Tippman's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Apex Fast Attack | $125+ | OEM'd by Classic Army, Apex's Fast Attack AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. Versions with GFP and metal receivers are available. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
ICS [CS4 Sportline](http://www.icsbb.com/product-category/electric-gun/electric-gun-cs4/electric-gun-cs4-sport/) | $190+ | ICS' Sportline AR-15s are effectively a re-shell of their excellent regular guns in a GFP receiver. They retain the convenient split gearbox system of the regular guns. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an ICS AR-15.
Specna Arms CORE | $130+ | Largely restricted to the European market, Specna Arms' CORE series of GFP AR-15s are considered to be reliable, robust, and good value for money. Many players now recommend these over CM16s, to which they are roughly equivalent. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a Specna Arms AR-15.

**FAQs:**

1. **What's the next step?** If you're new to airsoft and haven't already, reply '**airsoftbot how do I start**'. In the FAQ at the bottom of that reply is a series of steps that will guide you further.

2. **I can't afford any of the guns listed. Now what?** Reply 'airsoftbot what does it cost'.

3. **I've got more to spend than any of the guns listed cost. Now what?** In order to lower the cost of entry to airsoft, the guns recommended above prioritise a low purchase price. Good intermediate and high-end guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than the guns recommended above. Intermediate alternatives are listed alongside the beginner models recommended above, but the massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

4. **What else do I need?** Your gun is only one part of a weapons system, and will require batteries, a battery charger and potentially a battery tester/balancer, and ammunition. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'. If you can afford them, you should also purchase more magazines and potentially a speedloader. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'. The purchase of more magazines usually necessitates the purchase of gear which enables you to carry them, and a sling. You may also wish to purchase weapon accessories such as optical sights and lights. For more information on some recommended weapons systems, reply 'airsoftbot loadouts'. The massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

FlyingChange,1372458570.0,,,[],,Dressage,dark,text,t2_c7726,False,"I'm glad it was helpful! There are definitely a *ton* of good hunter/jumpers in the US and Canada. I'd honestly look in Canada for a horse before I'd go to Europe, just because of the sheer expense of bringing a horse here from Europe.

I believe that a lot of trainers and pros import horses because it's something of a fashion statement to have an imported warmblood- it sounds fancy, special, exclusive, and elite, and that's something the professionals definitely like. A lot of Americans get sucked into the idea that the Europeans breed better horses, and as /u/workingtrot said, American bred horses are just as good as German bred horses. With IVF, embryo transfers, and modern semen transport techniques, we are able to get exactly the same genetic material here in the US as they have in Germany. A Rotspon baby born on American soil will be just as good as a Rotspon baby born in Germany... and with embryo transfers, that baby can come out of basically any mare with a functioning uterus, which is wild! I worked at one breeding farm where the boss's prized mare once had 5 babies in year, all done with embryo transfers. Crazy stuff. Anyway, I digress.

If you don't mind me asking, are you a professional or an adult amateur? In some cases, professionals might have a reason to bring a horse back (for example, if they have a buyer, or their business is specifically imports, or they found a mare they want to add to a breeding program, or they just found a truly exceptional horse who happens to live abroad). Most of the good professionals that I've worked for, however, competed mainly on American bred horses. California has a *ton* of amazing sport horse breeders. Washington is getting there, and there are a few good ones in Oregon. Idaho is home to one woman who won USDF Breeder of the Year three times, breeding horses in her backyard. Point being, there are quality horses around here, you just need to know where to look.

Most internet keyboard warriors that hate sjws are not actually alt-right. Most anti-feminists again, are not alt-right. Most 'gamergate' type people, again, not alt-right. Jordan Peterson and his fans - not alt right. Ben Shapiro NOT alt-right. Stephen Fry - well, you get the picture. https://medium.com/@Ben_Chapman/who-exactly-is-the-alt-right-as-told-by-the-alt-right-3f357e03ab41 This article might give you a better idea.

I would hazard a guess, that quite a bit more than half of the people on the internet who complain about the far-left or radical-left who you believe are alt-right are actually NOT.

Some people are concerned their ethnic group will become a minority (a demographic certainty for many white people in Europe or for many ethnic groups in SE Asian which are facing large scale Han Chinese migration). But others are concerned with ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù which is still an obsession with ethnic make up, albeit a drive towards people of non-native ethnicity in the hopes of creating a more vibrant society.

Yet I would heavily suspect you‚Äôd call the first concern far-right and probably racist, but call the second one liberal and inclusive. 

This is both a problem with your definition (and I could go through the other points you included as well) and with all definitions of far-right. They are essentially useless identifying real groups of people, and offer little argument as to why these people are wrong. It seems to me better to criticise very specific attitudes, e.g. racial hatred, fascism, eugenics, ethnic superiority, etc, than the loose term far-right. 

For instance, a village or town with a few hundred people might have several hundred migrants settled in the area. Now no matter how much any the residents might wish the migrants had a better life I‚Äôd be surprised if there wasn‚Äôt widespread concern for the towns culture and perhaps even ethnic make-up,as the two are in some vague ways linked.

Sirhamm2,1462396040.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_xoyfa,False,"It‚Äôs the New Year, which must mean that railway fares are up again ‚Äì this time by an average of 3.1 per cent. Jeremy Corbyn has said the latest price hike is a ‚Äòdisgrace‚Äô, and commuters forced to shell out more for their journeys are likely to agree.

No one ‚Äì not even Chris Grayling ‚Äì is pretending that Britain‚Äôs railways are perfect, or that the system that they operate under does either. The Transport Secretary has in fact explicitly stated this week that ‚Äòthe franchising model cannot be the path for the future‚Äô. But at the same time, there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not said often enough, or even at all: Britain‚Äôs rail network is actually not that bad.

As a new briefing by one of my colleagues at the Centre for Policy Studies points out, customer satisfaction ratings in Britain are consistently higher than all other big European rail networks. User numbers have doubled since privatisation; and railway has almost doubled its share of passenger journeys in recent years.

Yes, punctuality is a problem: Britain was ranked 20th in an EU survey in 2016. But much of that is because we use our track more effectively and intensively than pretty much any other country. Pushing through more trains means less slack in the system when things go wrong. And while this year‚Äôs timetable fiasco ‚Äì as well as bad weather earlier in the year ‚Äì meant punctuality dropped in 2018, things are still much better than in the dog days of Railtrack.

When it comes to reliability, frequency of trains and quality of stations, Britain thumps the French and Germans on satisfaction ratings (even if the UK does fall down the rankings when it comes to getting a seat). In fact, the EU, pre-Brexit, was sending delegations over here to learn from us how to run better railways for less subsidy than the rest of its members are managing.

And yes, prices are high and getting higher. That‚Äôs painful for commuters. But it‚Äôs also partly a result of a decision to make them pay the price of their own journey, rather than have it subsidised by the general taxpayer. This is why saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôve got the highest prices in Europe‚Äô is misleading: in Europe people are mostly paying for trains through taxes, not tickets. In UK, it‚Äôs the reverse. Given that commuters tend to be richer than the rest, it‚Äôs not entirely obvious that asking others to pay more to make their fares cheaper is the solution.

Another point that needs to be made, given Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs passion for renationalisation, is that bringing the rail network back under public control is a slogan rather than a solution.

For all the talk about evil franchise operators draining money out, the contracts they‚Äôre under mean they‚Äôre often acting more as contractors than actual operators. They are effectively being paid a management fee for running railways according to government prescription. The 3.1 per cent fare hike today, for example, is happening because government says that‚Äôs the figure. And it‚Äôs calculated based on RPI (a bad, high measure of inflation) because that‚Äôs the measure government likes. (It‚Äôs also the measure in all the contracts running throughout the rail system.)

Labour‚Äôs shadow transport minister Andy McDonald is right that raising fares by CPI, rather than RPI, is a way to reduce ticket prices for consumers. But there is another way that ticket prices might be reduced that I would bet Labour is less keen on. The RMT and other unions say they want to end the great rail rip-off. If so, will these unions moderate their own wage demands, which are a significant part of rising costs ‚Äì including their demand that the RPI link be retained when it comes to their own increases? I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

Jeremy Corbyn was today pictured standing at King‚Äôs Cross alongside banner-waving RMT activists, calling for lower fares. But again, it‚Äôs not entirely obvious that giving the unions more control over the rail network ‚Äì even if you strip out the nasty, evil privatised train operating companies ‚Äì will result in lower costs for commuters.

Things are far from perfect on Britain‚Äôs railways. But they are better than we think ‚Äì and better, too, than most of our European rivals.

The state controlled everything, your just reading poems im rainbow land and believing your stupidity blindly.

Maybe I can explain the situation a little bit without everyone shouting at each other?

The most well known socialist/communist movements in the 20th century, like for example the Soviet Union, Maoist China, etc. all originated from one dude called Lenin and it is today often called Marxism-Leninism. Marxism is in the name because Lenin considered Marx's work to be the foundation of his believes.

Now, Marx wrote a big book about capitalism that explained how it works, why it can't just go on forever without eventually being replaced with another system and where he was very critical of it. But Marx also acknowledged that capitalism has given humanity incredible possibilities, as capitalism is incredibly efficient in growing and industrializing an economy and he even said that fully developed capitalism is a necessary step before socialism can happen.

Lenin disagreed that a socialist revolution needs to happen ""naturally"" due to the collapse of liberal capitalism and adapted Marxist thoughts to his home country, Russia, where capitalism and industrialization wasn't really a thing yet. He claimed that with the help of state capitalism upheld by a strong, authoritarian state, they would eventually be able to prepare for socialism/communsm until the developed countries, like Germany and the UK, had their revolution and ""overcame"" capitalism. 

Of course, fascism in Europe put an end to the socialist revolutions about to happen, so the soviet state put their old plans of establishing socialism on hold (more or less) and concentrated on defending themselves against fascism. After that, the justified their  totalitarian state as being necessary because of the cold war.

Today, most socialists/communists, especially in the west, don't support Marxism-Leninism for their country. You will still find people defending the soviet union, but even then, it is seen as a specific ""solution"" for a specific time and country. 

So, to come back to the main question: Was the soviet union ""real communism""?

Ideologically speaking, yes they where communists (or at the very least claimed that they were). This means that their end plan was to eventually build a communist society (which is according to theory classless, stateless and moneyless). This doesn't mean that everyone who calls themselves communist/socialists wants the same thing that the soviet union wants, as there is a lot of different theories about how this can be achieved and Marxism-Leninism is a very specific one. 

Strictly economically speaking, they never were or claimed that they were communist society.

There is no universal right or correct in politics, mind you. What's right for some, might be wrong for others and it will always be that way.

We zitten ongeveer een half procent onder het Europese gemiddelde wanneer het aankomt op budget wat betreft de openbare orde (als percentage van totaal overheidsbudget).

Besef dat er outliers zijn, voornamelijk landelijke of zeer kleine/dunbevolkte landen die het gemiddelde aanzienlijk naar beneden halen (de Scandinavische landen, Luxemburg...). Al die landen zijn ook welvarender dan Belgi√´ en hebben een lagere belastingdruk, allemaal factoren die zorgen voor minder misdaad, ergo minder nood aan een hoog budget voor publieke orde.

Misdaadcijfers worden land per land anders berekend, maar we kunnen ons het best baseren op [moordcijfers per 100.000 inwoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate): merk op dat Belgi√´ het in West-Europa het slechtst doet.

Iran is bff with qatar and turkey, and qatar and turkey are in turn bff with america. They're all working behind the scenes for mutual benefit.  Qatari media is so pro iran, and the qatari officials themselves are  and if this annoyed the us it would'nt be the case. Remember that qatar is essentially one big us military base, which is also the second homeland of every MB activist out there (along w turkey ofc).

&gt;  
&gt;The Brexit deal asumes that the UK and the EU will still be negotiating later, and both sides will have to talk to each other to discontinue the backstop.

Yes, but in this situation the EU would have the UK trapped in a customs union, the rules of which the UK have no say. Both sides would need to talk, but the EU would have all the power, because it can change the rules of the customs union at any time in ways the disadvantage the UK.  


&gt; That the UK insists on such a unilateral mechanism shows that it doesn't negotiate in good faith 

What it shows is that the UK does not trust the EU to negotiate in good faith. And with good reason, given that the whole of the brexit negotiations have been in bad faith from the EU, right from the start. The EU has always had a political agenda that took precedence to any economic concerns. ""Brexit cannot be a success"" said Juncker, and the obvious reason was that the EU wanted to make damned sure that any other member thinking of leaving would get the message that they should expect to be punished if they tried it.   


&gt; From this conclusion it follows that the EU will be better of with a  cliff-edge Brexit than with a treaty with an untrustworthy third party  country.

TOModera,1317416403.0,,tartan1k,[],,Dungeons and Drams,dark,text,t2_5ygxw,False,"Thanks to my wife for taking the pictures.

As part of the [Toronto Whisky Society](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/) I was invited to take part in a **Macallan Master Decanter Series** tasting. While I try to keep any bias from affecting the below reviews, I am human, therefore feel free to tell me I suck multiple times.

Well, it wasn‚Äôt all of the Master Decanter Series. You see there‚Äôs the Macallan Rare Cask, and then above that are four Scotches that form the Master Decanter Series, much like Voltron. Unlike a Voltron villain, I only faced off with  three of the four.

Rarely we get to see how these taste. Let‚Äôs get to it, shall we?

* * *

Up first we started with **Macallan Rare Cask**. The idea behind it is simple: Take 50 casks per batch, selected by the whisky team, looking at mainly first fill casks. Vat them together and release it to the world.

The plan for choosing the casks is the connections that Macallan has with many cooperages in Spain, giving them access to higher quality sherry casks.

So that‚Äôs the idea. But how does it turn out? Let‚Äôs see, shall we?

**Price:** $399.95 CAD at the LCBO (with glass stopper)

**Region:** Speyside

**Casks Used:** 100% American and European oak ex-sherry casks

**Abv:** 43%

**Colour:** 2.5YR 7/8 (or Ruby Dark Red, as I was told)

**Nose:** Rich plum pudding, coconut oil soap, oak, cocoa, light smoke

Initial plum, brown sugar/cooked molasses and plum notes. Some drier coconut/floral aspects, and some oak. Didn‚Äôt add water given the abv. Time gives a bit of smoke and cocoa, along with some oak.

Nice to nose. Certainly not rough anywhere, though some may find it a bit dry at first. Give it time‚Ä¶ Unless you also aren‚Äôt a fan of smoke, at which point‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶. Well, there are other whiskies.

**Taste:** Mexican chocolate, coconut meat, charred beef, brown sugar

Cinnamon/cocoa connects us to the nose, along with a coconut meatiness. Some umami/beef broth, some brown sugar as well. Certainly nice.

Mouthfeel is lighter than I‚Äôd like. Also takes quite a bit to coax out the sugar which is needed here to balance some of the drier/umami aspects.

**Finish:** Plum, flour, nutmeg, dry orange rind, smoke

Finish is shorter than I‚Äôd like. Rich plum, some raw aspects now. It really goes into the sherry aspect of things here, with orange, plum, and nutmeg dominating.

**Conclusion:** For these reviews, I‚Äôm going to speak to two different whisky fans. In the past few weeks, there have been some people who noted that some buy whiskies to have them sit on the shelf.

I am not one of those people, frankly. But I should speak to it when talking about these (note my final score is based on the taste alone).

As far as taste goes, it‚Äôs certainly nice to sip on. There was little roughness going on with it, and I did expect a bit more given the height of the casks. The finish was probably the roughest part, with the nose being the nicest. I wouldn‚Äôt call this the dreaded ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, it‚Äôs certainly got those nice festive winter spices going for it, which is quite nice, and it‚Äôs a step up for those people who want a simpler ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù whisky. In the end, the light aspects are 100% the issue of the abv. Which is too bad. I‚Äôd really enjoy this if it was at a higher alcohol percentage.

As for the bottle, given the nice stopper and the different looks, it certainly will sit nicely on your shelf. The inclusion of the word ‚Äúrare‚Äù should make friends who don‚Äôt know anything about whisky make ooh sounds. That said, the Macallan 18 may get more attention due to having a number on it.

**82/100**

* * *

**Macallan Reflexion** is up next. The impetus behind it is all of the casks were ex-sherry hogsheads or 250L in a system that makes sense. Each of the casks is designed, crafted, toasted, seasoned, and perhaps even had a special Ancient Greek prayer said over it to ensure Dionysus is happy by Macallan‚Äôs Master of Wood.

You know, I always wanted to have that moniker in the whisky world. Guess Dick jokes was the wrong direction.
So we have another study in wood (teehee) here. More wood contact (teehee) influences the malt more.

But how does this wood focused malt taste (teehee)? Let‚Äôs see, shall we?

**Price:** $1,603 CAD at the LCBO

**Region:** Speyside

**Casks Used:** 100% first fill ex-Sherry American &amp; European oak Hogsheads

**Abv:** 43%

**Colour:** 10R 3/8 

**Nose:** Nutella, cranberry fudge, apple tart, melon, vanilla

Hmm, nuttiness (teehee) and chocolate at first. Time gives more oak, red fruit, and some creaminess.  Mellows out after a few seconds with some apple and melon, a bit of vanilla even.

It‚Äôs interesting to get the mixture of vanilla and red fruit/spice from only ex-sherry cask. Might be the use of American oak? Nice surprise.

**Taste:** Cinnamon hearts, blondie, cotton, raisin, butter, papaya

Big amount of cinnamon followed by brown sugar, some vegetal/softness, raisin, more butter. Starts out with a lot of heat but then relaxes to a good mixture of tropical fruit and butter.

May turn you off at first. Give it a few more minutes to wake up all happy and whatnot.

**Finish:** Orange sorbet, dry apple, craisins, nutmeg, leather, cereal

Good subdued orange followed by fruit, leather (love leather) and some cereal. Round notes, no real roughness, and not a super quick finish as the Rare Cask.

**Conclusion:** For my money, this was the one that stood out during the evening. Part of the is because of the wood influence giving those vanilla and butter notes, as well as the fact I love cinnamon like I‚Äôm married to a tree.

The finish fixes a lot of what happened before. While the rare cask may have a more universally liked nose, the overall dram here is much better. It‚Äôs surprising when a low abv. Scotch-like this that doesn‚Äôt taste like it‚Äôs missing aspects. So if you were to get the chance, try a dram of this. It‚Äôs really quite special.
But what about the packaging to sit upon a giant mantlepiece? Well, the box certainly spreads out in an eye-drawing fashion, the bottle itself is very different and nice looking compared to other whisky bottles. So if you‚Äôre never going to open something but want to stare at the red/wood colour of the whisky without tasting it, this could be for you.

**85/100**

Its not about who gets hurt more, the basic fact is that Ireland will suffer in the event of a no deal, and a hard border will rise. 

&gt;Regardless I don't see that as an adequate reason for Ireland to give up hard fought for rights to serve a foreign state that seem intent on achieving unicorn brexit, a brexit that is both unfair to everyone else and impossible to achieve.

That is fair, and if Ireland's attitude is genuinely that they would rather have the pain of no deal and a hard border than a softer border and trade deal because they won't step back on principle, then I shan't argue with that. However if instead the attitude was that Britain is unlikely to leave without a deal, and base their demands around the idea that they could get whatever they wanted regarding NI, then they have made a grievous error (and a border across Ireland and economic carnage will be the outcome). Its similar to the UK - if you genuinely believe that it is better to leave without a deal that with May's deal - because you hate the deal, or because you want to stand up to the EU - then fair, it'll hurt but you're aware of that. If you think we should refuse the deal as a bluff to get a better one then you are a fool, and will suffer the same fate as Syriza.

DangerousSuccotash,1541779050.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2kgu09c4,False,"&gt; Classic racist defense 

Wrong little Jewboy, when will you learn that making claims doesn't make them true? But of course you don't care about truth, only the hypnotic power of persuasion, the substitute for truth in Jewish culture's interface with ""the nations.""

Again, classic and actual racism hates people on account of their immutable characteristics. Being Jewish is optional. Any Jew who wishes to leave the death cult behind is welcome to join us with equal standing. 

The real racists are the Jews belonging to  a religion and culture awash in racism. Virtually every Chief Rabbi Israel has ever had for Sephardim or Ashkenazim has expressed racist sentiments, as do secular revisionist zionists, as does Israeli policy, as does all Jewish ""holy"" literature. Your culture's bedrock principle is racism. But as usual these facile tactics of ""antisemitism"" to distract from the real issue. 

&gt; and what you just described IS ANTISEMITISM. YOU HATE JEWS! You said so in so many words with the same rhetoric that‚Äôs been used for nearly a century, if not more. 

Good faith argumentation doesn't need to make up strawmen and tilt at windmills. All you can do is pretend my position is other than what it is and die on that hill.

I do not hate Jews. I hate particular kinds of Jews who bring misery to the world - high financiers, etc. The average cattle Jew I simply pity, as much collateral to this madness as the rest of us; more in some ways.


&gt; The reason we don‚Äôt let go of the holocaust is because we were the victims. It‚Äôs like you telling me the American Slave trade was at the fault of the African‚Äôs and who ever. Saying.‚Äùif only they ran faster‚Äù. That‚Äôs your message when you argue the semantics of what happened. If you didn‚Äôt have family affected by said event, Jewish or not then keep your fucking mouth shut.

Again with the strawmen. I never said that the Holocaust was the fault of, say, innocent shtetl-dwellers. It was, however, the fault of organized Jewry who demonstrably funded the Nazi party and had an explicit intent, made clear by no other than Herzl himself, to ally with nationalistic antisemitism in order to increase Jewish suffering and therefore support for Zionism and immigration to Palestine. 


&gt; The Jews talk about the Holocaust and put emphasis on it so that we don‚Äôt forget what happened. Antisemitism is OUR form of racism and persecution and it‚Äôs ingrained in Western society, it‚Äôs just a filtered version of what you‚Äôre describing.

Aww, crocodile tears, so cute. What's also cute is that Jews aren't content to describe racist sentiment against them as racist. They need a special word for it, a special propagandic token - for the special people. The chosen victims. 

Also amusingly is that the term is itself antisemitic because it erases the semitic identities of all other semites and denies them equivalent consideration. 

Of course Jews extend the term disingenuously - as is their way - to include not just actual racism but criticism of Jewish religion, culture and state policy. A propaganda coup if there ever was one, a magic wand to wave away anything Jews don't like being said. The truth? Irrelevant to that mentality; is it good for the Jews? Usually not. 

&gt; Do you know what it‚Äôs like to be considered a scapegoat for one of the most hated demographics at this point and time? To constantly have your culture and heritage under attack and contributions to society mocked? The one culture that‚Äôs not allowed to have any pride and must always remain humble, yes white pride has a stigma but Jew‚Äôs aren‚Äôt white. We‚Äôre only lumped in there to again, be a scape goat.

Jewish pride is promoted, white pride is not. You are dissembling and trying to impress me with your well-coached victim narrative again. In actuality the Jews were always a privileged group compared to others, throughout the entire middle ages in Europe and in the modern period. Despite occasional and minor ""pogroms,"" the Jews suffered far less from wars, serfdom, etc., than other groups. The Jewish persecution complex is an absurdity I will have no truck with. Go cry on your own wall.

&gt; There is only one Jewish state in the entire world and it was created as a nation to fail. Ideally for religious purposes and as the British Empire‚Äôs final solution... this pattern has been going on forever and it‚Äôs sick.

Haha. Cute. Finding a way to whine even about being given Israel by a nation compelled against its own interest by the Jewish money power. A nation that tolerated all manner of Jewish terrorism against it and facilitated in the dispossession of the Arabs.

&gt; You have generations of people who have a rich cultural history but can‚Äôt learn about it because of assimilation, conversion and the records being destroyed.

I really love assimilation and conversion of Jews =). Ze real Final Solution to ze Jewish Problem.

RE: Nationalisation, it's more like they have a deliberately poisoned view of nationalisation. British Rail was much more efficient than what we have now, for instance. The only publicly run rail franchise in the UK was also the most consistently successful.

It's interesting you singled out British Leyland as well, because it wasn't a failure of nationalisation - and this is to my point. British Leyland was a private company that the government was forced to bail out after a series of uncontrolled mergers and acquisitions resulted in its bankruptcy. If BL hadn't been nationalised, 40% of the UK's car industry would have disappeared overnight, resulting in a massive spike in unemployment at a time when things already weren't so great. If the then-Labour government hadn't stepped in it would've been seen as a huge betrayal of both British industry and their own voters. It had virtually nothing to do with nationalisation for its own sake and more with managing the assets of a business that was too big to fail.

(It's worth pointing out that the nationalisation of the railways occurred under similar circumstances. Although it was part of Atlee's program, the companies that owned them were effectively bankrupt at the time and in no position to run them.

The same happened with [Guinea pigs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig#Name)

One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea. ""Guinea"" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country. Another hypothesis suggests the ""guinea"" in the name is a corruption of ""Guiana"", an area in South America, though the animals are not native to that region.

- French: cochon d'Inde (Indian pig)
- Dutch: Guinees biggetje (Guinean piglet) 
- Spanish: conejillo de Indias (little rabbit of the Indies)
- Chinese: Ëç∑Ëò≠Ë±¨ (h√©l√°nzh≈´, Holland pigs)

It's easier to make wrong but intuitive assumptions. Chinese are indeed nationalistic but the fact that GM sales half of its car in China has nothing to do with its nationalism. In fact, [in 2017, VW sold 3.9 millions in China](http://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-data/) and That's not far off from GM. Japanese automotive manufacturer also enjoys similar success in China. 

The reason why half of GM's sales are in China is because its sheer market size of 1.4 billion people.

The new currency, brought into being on January 1st 1999, has defied early critics, who thought it doomed to failure. It has emerged from its turbulent teenage years intact, cheating a near-death experience, the debt crisis of 2009-12. It is now more popular than ever with the public. But fundamental tensions attended its birth. Although the euro has made it this far, they still hang over it. If Europe‚Äôs single currency is to survive a global slowdown or another crisis it will require a remodelling that politicians seem unwilling or unable to press through.

To its supporters the bold economic experiment was the culmination of half a century of European co-operation and a crucial step towards an ‚Äúever closer union‚Äù that would unite a continent once riven by conflict. ‚ÄúNations with a common currency never went to war against each other,‚Äù said Helmut Kohl, Germany‚Äôs chancellor who, together with France‚Äôs president, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, championed monetary union in the 1990s to cement deeper political and economic integration.

Each member brought its own hopes and fears to the union. To the French it was a way of taming the economic might of a newly reunified Germany and the power of the Bundesbank. To the Germans, who feared they would eventually foot the bill for profligate southerners, the prize was a stable currency and an end to competitive devaluations by Italy. To the Italians, Greeks and other southerners, monetary union was a means of borrowing the inflation-fighting credibility of the Bundesbank, on which the European Central Bank (ECB) was modelled.

The most vocal critics of the euro‚Äîmany in America‚Äîsaw a foolhardy plan crafted by naive politicians. The currency union would shackle together economies that were too different in structure while taking away a weapon to fight ‚Äúasymmetric‚Äù downturns that hit individual members, such as a local housing bust. By giving up the ability to devalue currencies, the only way to adjust would be through painful and politically troublesome cuts to real wages. Unlike America, which also shares a monetary union, there would be no federal budget to help stabilise demand across state borders. Milton Friedman gave the euro no more than ten years before it collapsed and took the eu with it.

Neither its staunchest advocates nor its harshest critics have proved correct. The currency area has grown to 19 countries and ranks as the world‚Äôs second-largest economy, when measured using market-exchange rates, behind only America. But the euro has only muddled through. Political will, particularly at its Franco-German core, meant that just enough was done to ensure that the euro survived the debt crisis but none of the union‚Äôs fundamental problems was solved. As it enters its third decade, the question is whether the currency can withstand the next upheaval.

Currency affairs
To do so will require the right economic tools to overcome the euro area‚Äôs weaknesses. These became obvious after debt crises engulfed Greece, then Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The unresolved conflicts of the past 20 years has meant too little integration and too little reform. Crucial gaps in its structure are yet to be fixed, and its ammunition is limited. At the same time, Europe is politically more divided. In many countries, mainstream leaders are succumbing to populists. Divisions have widened between the fiscally disciplined north and the south, which advocates redistribution across borders.

The deeper cross-border integration of economies, banks and capital markets that would alleviate domestic economic difficulties has not materialised. The euro‚Äôs architects hoped that deeper integration would make the pain of real-wage adjustment easier to bear. But the external discipline of a single currency has not, as hoped, forced governments to undertake much reform to labour and product markets to improve competitiveness and so bring economies into line. Members trade more with each other. But, compared with grand expectations, the gains have been modest. Labour mobility is still low.

Financial integration has been limited, too. In America, capital and credit flowing from the rest of the country cushion the impact of a downturn in any one state. But a single capital market has not fully developed in the euro area. According to the OECD, a rich-country club, the corporate-bond market amounts to a tenth of GDP, compared with over two-fifths in America. A study by the European Commission in 2016 found that integration of capital and labour markets helped to cushion the blow of half of asymmetric shocks in America but only a tenth in the euro area.

No sense of togetherness
What banking integration has occurred has amplified risks not spread them. Banks have done little direct lending to firms and households across euro-area borders. Lending in the 2000s was of the flighty interbank sort that could easily be withdrawn. This fed macroeconomic imbalances: net foreign liabilities in Portugal, Greece and Spain rose to 80% or more of GDP by 2008. But capital fled swiftly once the global financial crisis got under way. Foreign debts suddenly could not be rolled over and crisis erupted.

Without deep integration, the burden of adjustment falls on member states that are already stricken. Greece was engulfed by crisis after it overspent and hid its fiscal deficits. The crisis spread to Ireland, poleaxed by reckless banks, and Spain, which suffered a property bust. Matters were made worse in an infernal loop of doom as governments struggled to borrow enough to support failing banks, while banks were beset by the tumbling value of the government debt they held. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus needed bail-outs. In return, northern countries insisted on stringent austerity measures and onerous structural reforms.

The Euro area has become more balanced economically as a result of these measures. Gaps in competitiveness that ballooned during the first decade of the currency‚Äôs existence have since narrowed as wages have been slashed and collective-bargaining practices reformed in southern states. Almost every country‚Äîapart from France, Estonia and Spain‚Äîis now running a primary fiscal surplus (ie, before interest payments). Ireland, Portugal and Spain ran current-account deficits before the crisis, but are now running surpluses.

Nevertheless, as the euro area enters its third decade it is still vulnerable to another downturn and underlying tensions are unresolved, if not sharpened. Past imbalances have left large debts that are only slowly being chipped away. Greece, Portugal and Spain have big external debts [(see chart 1)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190105_FBC084.png). Fiscal firepower is limited. Seven countries have public debt around or over 100% of GDP [(see chart 2)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190105_FBC086.png).

1. That you think the way US sports franchises are run bears any resemblance to those of European football teams, that this comparison could be relevant in anyway.
2. That you don't know that Kroenke doesn't actually have any part in running Arsenal AND of course, the club is funded by it's own success and failure - so bringing up how his American teams are doing is doubly irrelevant just from that aspect.

wewerewerewolvesonce,1521903359.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1355yvm5,False,"&gt; When I spoke about longevity I meant in the Modern Age. Even though mercantilism and feudalism or all other previous forms of social organization have much more in common with capitalism than with communism. 

To some extent I'd agree with this, I do think communism is to some extent a break with much of human history. However I actually think capitalism was in many ways a similar break with much of human history given that it more than basically any other form of social organization causes a major split between the economic and the political.

&gt; Well of course, conflict shapes society, ideas, everything. But it can also bring a much needed equilibrium. In fact precisely this conflict of interests is what contributes heavily to the essence of democracy.  

Yes I'd agree with this, to some extent however I don't think you're likely to see democracy in the true sense in capitalist countries partly because of the fact that most political representatives have far more to do with rentier/merchant classes than they do with the working class and partly because of the effect that capital has on the nature of the political system. This was more or less Einstein's reasoning I believe

[https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/)

&gt; I think a degree of ""class"" conflict will always exist and that ultimate consensus is rather an Utopia that would anyway lead to progress stagnation 

I think this is to some extent true but I think it can be greatly diminished as for progress stagnation. I won't go into this too much here but I would actually say I think progress particularly in developed economies has more to do with commodity fetishism than it does with societal or technological progress. There's additionally a number of ways the profit motive constrains progress which is particularly evident if you look at say, treatment for certain illnesses. 

&gt;  but to make sure that human life is still valued and preserved across the board through a decent living standard. Objective inequality is otherwise inevitable, we carry it in our genes, some of us are better at some things than others and vice versa. But being humble in acknowledging the superiority of other in some specific domain it is actually a positive trait, at least in my opinion. 

Marx didn't disagree with this and neither do I, he actually referred to egalitarianism as bourgeois conception and whilst I wouldn't use that phrase I think it's unhelpful as a goal. I would say my actual ideas are similar to yours in that I believe in giving every human being the chance to flourish. 

&gt; Welfare is implemented in different forms all over the world. All European Union states have that for example. 

Yes however as we're seeing in the UK through the universal credit system and in other countries through austerity this appears to be less of safety net in developed economies, alongside stagnating wages and poor economic growth. I think this is partly ideological but I also think it's partly because growth is brushing up against it's limits. 

&gt; As someone who lived in a communist state I can certainly claim that communism actually existed. It never reached it's full maturity, because it failed on the way. 

Just to be clear I don't think this means there have never been any communists I just think what they achieved was state socialism which judging from your accounts and what I've read seems congruent with your experience.

&gt; As they were predicated by Marx himself, it's hard to dissociate that from ideological Marxism (which is, by his own words, the communism). I've witnessed the forced expropriation, the violent exertion of power, the terror imposed upon critique and free speech, the poverty, the indoctrination in the public education system... all that and more. I have a separate post only about this subject. 

Marx also intended any communist overthrow to take place in what were considered advanced economies. The reason for this is because if this took place in less advanced economies still suffering from scarcity it would lead to similar class divisions that you witnessed in capitalism except the party would replace the bourgeois class in their struggle for resources.

 Rodrigo Yokota As f√©rias de ver√£o come√ßaram e, com elas, muita gente j√° passou pelo mart√≠rio inicial de ""descansar"" durante os feriados de Natal e R√©veillon. E mais uma vez me coloco a pergunta: por que todo o mundo junto, ao mesmo tempo? Ser√° que √© poss√≠vel relaxar da conviv√™ncia com as multid√µes da metr√≥pole, mergulhando em outra multid√£o (de gente, de demanda, de excessos) em outro lugar?

 Tive uma experi√™ncia dura e definitiva anos atr√°s. Estava inesperadamente livre para virar o ano sem histerias: fam√≠lia viajando, sozinho em S√£o Paulo, sem programa de passar R√©veillon com milhares de pessoas fazendo uma contagem regressiva sem perceber que em meio mundo o ano j√° tinha virado ‚Äîe, pior, que em quase todo o Brasil ele s√≥ passaria mesmo dali a uma hora, devido ao hor√°rio de ver√£o.

 Pois estava eu na minha tranquila S√£o Paulo, quando um casal de amigos ligou, l√° por 29 de dezembro, dizendo estar sozinhos numa casa em Camburi [(no lindo litoral norte do estado)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/12/arquipelago-dos-alcatrazes-em-sp-sera-aberto-ao-turismo-neste-domingo-16.shtml), convidando para juntar-me a eles.

 Pareceu ideia tentadora e de f√°cil execu√ß√£o. Em meia hora havia improvisado a mochila, agarrado alguns vinhos e ingredientes para nos divertirmos na cozinha, um viol√£o e a edi√ß√£o do dia da Folha. Entrei no carro e parti.

 Camburi fica a uns 160 quil√¥metros de S√£o Paulo, duas horas e meia de carro ‚Äîem condi√ß√µes normais de temperatura, press√£o e tr√°fego. Mas naquele dia o percurso tomou-me oito horas de vida e desespero.

 Eram tantos carros na estrada que nada andava. Ainda n√£o se lia not√≠cia no celular, o que fez com que, naquela in√©rcia angustiante, eu tenha lido n√£o s√≥ todas as not√≠cias do jornal, como tamb√©m, e com redobrado interesse, os an√∫ncios classificados, um a um.

 Fui mais uma v√≠tima das aglomera√ß√µes humanas de massa, quando quase todos se deslocam ao mesmo tempo, param ao mesmo tempo e v√£o aos mesmos lugares.

 Tr√¢nsito na rodovia dos Imigrantes, em S√£o Bernardo do Campo (SP), na volta do feriado de Natal - Rivaldo Gomes/Folhapress O epis√≥dio refor√ßou em mim uma velha convic√ß√£o: a de que, numa era em que a linha de montagem j√° depende t√£o pouco da presen√ßa humana e tantas atividades podem ser feitas remotamente, deveria ser criada uma mentalidade, e uma rotina, do contrafluxo.

 Sempre tento viajar no meio da semana, n√£o no final; e na meia esta√ß√£o, n√£o na alta. Assim como deslocar-me na cidade nos hor√°rios fora do pico --e se for num hor√°rio de pico, ir no sentido contr√°rio ao do tr√°fego (na hora em que est√° todo o mundo indo para o centro, √© hora de marcar um compromisso no bairro).

 N√£o pense que √© um drama paulistano: no mundo inteiro √© assim. [S√£o Paulo ainda tem uma vantagem](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/12/5-parques-no-brasil-com-trilhas-para-quem-e-amador.shtml): nos fins de semana e f√©rias, quando milh√µes viajam, quem fica aqui (ou, no contrafluxo, vem para c√°) encontra uma cidade um pouco mais tranquila (ruim para os neg√≥cios, mas um al√≠vio).

 J√° em outras metr√≥poles que s√£o polos tur√≠sticos, mesmo que parte de seus habitantes se ausente, s√£o substitu√≠dos por hordas de turistas.

 Se [Paris](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/11/louvre-tera-entrada-gratuita-uma-vez-por-mes.shtml) no alto ver√£o j√° √© desagrad√°vel pelo calor, quem est√° por l√° em agosto sofre duplamente: por um lado, v√°rios servi√ßos (pequenos, mas charmosos) estar√£o desativados pelas f√©rias (antiqu√°rios, restaurantes, lojas de bairro); por outro, as ruas estar√£o tomadas por turistas e os bistr√¥s que n√£o estiverem fechados estar√£o lotados. N√£o √© diferente em [Nova York](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/10/loja-de-brinquedos-do-filme-quero-ser-grande-sera-reaberta-em-ny.shtml) no alto e insuport√°vel ver√£o, ou no g√©lido (e pateticamente natalino) inverno.

 Meu palpite, em nome do conforto do turista, do morador e at√© da economia, √© que se criasse uma s√©ria mentalidade do contrafluxo. Que poupasse dissabores, mau humor, combust√≠vel e horas que deveriam ser de lazer.

 J√° soube de empresas que mudam seus hor√°rios de funcionamento para que os funcion√°rios entrem e saiam antes ou depois da hora do rush. Por que as cidades n√£o administram as empresas de forma a distribuir os hor√°rios?

 E as escolas? E os museus? S√£o Paulo tem ainda a cruel situa√ß√£o de oferecer um p√©ssimo transporte p√∫blico ‚Äîo que faz das horas de pico um tormento especialmente cruel. Mas n√£o √© s√≥ aqui: os eficientes metr√¥s de Londres, [Moscou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/06/dez-estacoes-de-metro-para-visitar-na-russia.shtml) ou [T√≥quio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/turismo/2018/11/descubra-toquio-de-metro-sem-falar-uma-palavra-de-japones.shtml) tamb√©m sofrem com a massa humana que os utiliza sempre ao mesmo tempo.

 L√° ou c√°, n√£o seria muito melhor distribuir o fluxo ao longo do dia? E pensando em termos mais amplos, n√£o seria melhor tamb√©m distribuir f√©rias e feriados ao longo do ano? Que tal parte dos funcion√°rios da empresa ter o fim de semana √†s quintas e sextas, outra parte √†s sextas e aos s√°bados, e assim por diante? Alternar datas de feriados; e trocar f√©rias de ver√£o por f√©rias de primavera?

 Quem sabe um dia algu√©m pense nisso. At√© l√° ‚Äîenquanto o fluxo de pessoas n√£o √© mais bem distribu√≠do‚Äî resta, a quem pode, se organizar para escapar do hiperfluxo que vai sempre na mesma dire√ß√£o, habituando-se a fugir da insanidade coletiva no tranquilo movimento contr√°rio.

The hostel I worked at back in the day employed plenty expats purely because they spoke a foreign language. The clientele in the industry was tourists, Germans and foreigners. That was always enough for the Amt. They weren‚Äôt students, they weren‚Äôt on work and travel visas. I know these people first-hand and was there when they got their visa renewed and how they just shrugged their shoulders over how easy it was. All they ever did was tending the bar or tour guiding some guests to a currywurst. 

Used to work for a language school, too. All the staff were Americans. 

My favorite bar employs a Japanese man. The bar is jazzy which is popular amongst the Japanese, hence there‚Äôs many Japanese customers. Japanese server is a business advantage that no German will be able to master. Case closed. 

The company I work at now (not hospitality, not education) employs many expats, as I said earlier, and they perform project management, -marketing, -IT jobs. Nothing a German couldn‚Äôt do. I feel like as long as the job/business/industry is tied into international market/clientele or specific foreign enterprises or languages, the Amt will give more leeway. 

Bottom line is that a German or EU-Citizen who is not a native English speaker cannot ever be more qualified to teach English (dual language kindergarten for example) than let‚Äôs say an Aussie. So look for a job in that direction and I bet it won‚Äôt be a problem. 

We have literally just relocated an American to be a PM. He brings in US market experience and acumen that almost no German will ever be able to provide. 

In my experience, this law is not much more than a Papiertiger. I would wager that it is actually easier to get a visa for a job that requires lower to no qualification than for anything with more merit, judging by yours and my experience.

So what do you think it exists for? Ireland making a land grab or some other contrived bollocks?

The PSNI are literally preparing for this. [They're asking for funds to employ up to 500 new recruits](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/31/brexit-northern-irish-police-funds-recruitment-protect-border) and [appealing for riot police from all over the UK to help out here post Brexit.](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/psni-appeals-for-more-riottrained-police-officers-from-rest-of-uk-ahead-of-brexit-report-37674824.html)

If you're not concerned yet: [MI5 currently spends about 18% of its operational and investigative resources in Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42434767) and is quoted in above link as saying ""Northern Ireland represents the ""most concentrated area of terrorist activity probably anywhere in Europe"", with terrorist activity disrupted on a weekly basis."" -- this is the status quo, ***without*** the major upset, propaganda boon, and breach of the Good Friday Agreement that a hard border will bring. Expect those numbers to rise.

Not only do we have traditional dissident groups on the war path around this new infrastructure, but [New IRA](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44082633) and a new generation of dissidents ready to take up a gun over it.

&gt; The UK will not enforce a hard border, the only political body which has threatened to do that is the European Union.

The UK cannot tell its arse from its ankle in regards to post Brexit reality right now. Theresa May has promised no land border in Ireland, no sea border, no border infrastructure, no checks... she has promised a multitude of contradicting items on a multitude of issues. The only thing for certain that we have seen is that she has been beaten back by the DUP and hard-Brexiteers on her attempts to place a border in the Irish sea, and as is clear as day, she lacks the backbone to force anything -- the way it is going right now is heading toward a hard border -- and regardless of who plants it or who enforces it, Brexit will be to blame, and Brexit came from the British. It will result in troubles here, again.

A meeting that resulted in the US no longer conducting military exercises in South Korea (among other things) and all we got was a ""promise"" to denuclearize, even though anyone who knows history knows not to trust NK. And for good reason, since they [continued to build and hide nuclear material, *after* the summit](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-still-making-nukes-trump-admin-now-taking-much-n907651). Basically, we gave up a lot and got nothing in return. Also, what about how Trump, *himself* considered China an enemy (we all know that he thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax meant to damage the US)? That they were currency manipulators, which damaged the US economy. [They were *raping* our economy](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/01/politics/donald-trump-china-rape/index.html).

npresston,1512245395.0,,,[],,5‚àÜ,dark,text,t2_d39jkqi,False,"&gt;I disagree. Peace is valued pretty much everywhere. Even China, which has the only rivaling system to democracy. Many other backward countries are able to keep up their despotic systems only because of the low education of their citizens. As this gets better over time, just like in Western Europe, the citizens won't accept anything but democracy especially if the despotic system doesn't spread the wealth.

Pick any time period in recorded human history. Pick any region of the world. (assuming it was inhabited during that period) You're going to find examples of a culture that solved its problems through violence, on some scale. Human beings are not inherently peaceful. We've had several thousand years to prove that. Democracy isn't some sort of objective Good, it isn't the universal direction of progress. We've been in a trend for the past several centuries towards democracy, but that isn't innate, it's subject to change and circumstance, and it wont always be the case.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's not a problem. The communication (both physical and information) was much worse in the 13 colonies that made up the US 250 years ago and the continental US 150 years ago than what it is for the whole world at the moment. You and I have no problem communicating even though we're probably on different continents. I could fly to see you within one day. Both of these were impossible in the US that was composed of only 13 initial states.

My intent there is less about accessibility and communication than it is sheer scale of diversity. Modern democracies have to deal with differing demographics and cultures within a fairly limited scope. Ultimately most cultures within a population are mostly similar. Increase the scale and you increase the diversity, and when you have a single source of authority making decisions that apply to the whole, you subsequently also see increased dissent to those decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, if the central power exerts too much political pressure on the regions, this won't work. That's exactly why I'm not talking about earth as an empire but as a federal system. This is exactly why a centrally controlled authoritarian global political system wouldn't work. There would be constant Catalonians going on and that would collapse the system. The only way to make it work is to leave most of the decisions in the local level and only concentrate conflict resolution on the global level. Note that Catalonia would like to be a member of the European Union (and so did Scotland when it tried to get independent a couple of years ago). They don't resent bigger political units as such, but only that they should keep their hands of the local things. The US and Switzerland are good examples on how this can work in practice. Both are culturally very diverse, but what binds them together is the trust in the system.

I think you hopped clean over the point in that sentence. Catalonia attempted to make a decision that was unacceptable to the whole. Eventually a unit of a global government is going to come to a decision that the whole cannot abide, because it affects the whole, and they will HAVE to interfere. The larger and more complex the system, the more common and problematic this becomes. This isn't just an observed behavior in human societies, any complex system features dissent of individual elements from the trends whole, and the only way to maintain the system is for those elements to be forced into the trend.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It gets voted down. Just like if California disagrees with, say, joing the Iraq war.

And if, following your example, California says no? What if a unit of the whole refuses to concede and refuses to compromise? Every source of authority is predicated on its abilities to enforce its will. That's why laws are enforced by police forces, and why international agreements by military responses. This kind of conflict, and the reactive force, are inevitable, and the larger a system grows the greater the level of imposed control has to be.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, the authoritarian system wouldn't work. The reason federal system works is that the units trust the system. They trust that central power won't intervene into the local issues. If it does, yes, that breaks the system and there's nothing the authoritarian system could do to stop it. Authoritarian system works only if the parts are not diverse (China is an example of this). China has one dominant language, one dominant culture and that's why the central control can work (and even that is heavily dependent delivering economic growth). With more diverse world, the only way is federalism. There's no way EU could ever turn into a country in a same way as France or Sweden are countries. At best it can evolve into a US style federal system with countries holding a lot of autonomy.

I suppose I've been misrepresenting myself: I don't mean to imply that an authoritarian system would function any better, or for very long. It would be doomed to fail, certainly. But it would also be doomed to exist, because, simply put, the units wouldn't trust the system. Look at countries that currently dissent against international law, the UN, and other major international alliances. Why would we expect conflict and dissent to decrease with an even more expansive system?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, so? Domestic means here something that breaks the constitution of the United States, not being a puppet to Donald Trump, for instance. That's the point. The federal army of the world would give itself for the use of force if one member broke the rules of the constitution. It would not take orders from the central government for it to break the rules because that itself is a domestic threat.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, the only justification for the size of the current US military is its foreign operations, not what is needed to keep peace internally. If the US had no foreign adversaries, there would be a huge push to cut down the military to a fraction of the current size (just as there was at the end of the cold war).

Thanks for calling that out, that thought was poorly thought through. What I mean to suggest is that major nations, even in times of relative peace have a historical trend of maintaining military and police forces beyond what might be considered strictly necessary. There's no reason to believe that a united government would reduce its capabilities to the extent you're suggesting.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes? Empire needs a big military, but a federal system doesn't. The political leaders who would try to expand a military would be voted out.

Would they? I think much of your argument is predicated on the assumption of the whole system, or at least a clear and irresistible majority, would sincerely work in the best interests of the whole before themselves. Human beings are inherently not so. Why vote out military leaders who espouse a large military when that force can then be used to bully your competitors or push your own agenda? Certainly, it isn't good for a fair, peaceful global democracy, but it's human nature to look after our own first, and outsiders second or never. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, but not all. That's the point. If the central government started bullying members outside of its remit of conflict resolution, it would lose the support of all the members and the whole thing would collapse.

Why would other members care about the subjugation of one if it's to their benefit? Or even if it isn't, but simply isn't impactful enough for them to warrant action? 

&amp;#x200B;

Are you familiar with Emery Reves' Democratic Manifesto? He discusses the trends of democracy that lead to the two world wars, and proposes basic principles of ethics, morality, and politics as a starting point for a global federal democracy. It's a fascinating read, but you very quickly get the sense that what he's proposing is authoritarian in nature.

The screenshot doesn't show a private conversation with the dev

&gt; Did you read the article linked? Or did you write it off immediately as SJW Bullshit and ignore it?

No, because it was a refutation of a point I never made. I didn't say the dev shouldn't take responsibility for his statements. In fact, just the opposite: I said that his intention as a European was likely very different from what Americans *assume* his intention was, and that the OP should've tried to talk to him privately. At that point, I said, he could consider unleashing the power of social media on the dev.

This is why I'm accusing you of not reading my comments.

&gt;""Oh, the Keen employee didn't *mean* it that way..."" So fuckin' what? Intention matters, but as the Politically Incorrect Redneck meme highlights - the exact words used matter too. 

Excuse me? Did you just use the word ""redneck?"" Do you realize how offensive that is to me, who has a relative who was vacationing in the south and was called a ""fucking redneck"" by someone in a pickup truck who threw a glass beer bottle at him??

Your intention does not matter. I'm going to make a thread about this, and if you're unlucky enough for that thread to gain traction, you'll find yourself the victim of a witchhunt.

&gt;The joke was apparently about how someone was asking for help, two other people stepped in to help, and then the Keen employee spoke up. That's the context for the joke. There's at least couple dozen other ways to say that without making remarks on ethnicity and historical atrocities. 

And that's why I accused you of thinking that your interpretation as an American makes you the center of the universe. We know the dev is from Europe, we know that the word means something else there. That's enough evidence to not assume the worst, and not assume that the dev meant it the way you're hearing it. But you don't even mention it in your summary of what happened.

&gt;But nevermind all that, as OP points out when someone says ""Dude, that's fucked up"" you don't reply ""Well who cares"" when you represent a company. 

Because why would someone who feels they didn't do anything wrong possibly defend themselves in an off the cuff manner?

&gt;You take what the person says in to consideration and see whether or not you agree. 

You don't treat every complaint against you with the same level of seriousness. No one does. You filter for what you already think is important, and it's hard to change people's minds as to what's important.

You know what educates almost no one? Creating a social media witchhunt.

Like I said, all that's likely to happen is what we've seen time and again: ""Look, I wish we lived in a world where people could speak their differences and come to an agreement, but the reputation-culture we live in now is just too dangerous for anyone to speak their minds. Because to do that risks being offensive, and if someone is offended they might summon a mob to destroy our company.""

It seems the majority of people I talk to nowadays don't get rollover/bank days either, so it's 15 days a year and you better take them or they're gone. With unlimited you just... go. 

I'd say the average employee at my agency takes 20-30 days a year. Still low by some European standards, but way better than the vast majority of my friends. It takes a mutual understanding and respect with your team to cover for each other, but I haven't had any problems with coverage or ever been shamed or shunned for taking off. It sucks covering for other people sometimes but when everyone is appreciative and willing to reciprocate the system works great. Our agency actually has a 15 day *minimum* policy, and while I have a feeling that's not strictly enforced and is more for ""culture bragging,"" it certainly lends to the notion that they're not trying to psychologically manipulate you into staying glued to your desk.

Even more important to me though is that we allow remote work, no questions asked. Being able to work from anywhere at any time is a MASSIVE perk for me and allows for travel (at least within US timezones) without worrying about coverage or time off or a massive backlog.

&gt; a war with EU 

Hang on a second. When did this become a discussion about war between the US and EU? Is that what you want?

&gt;A trade deficit isn't bad

Well, yes, it sort of is. Comes right off the top of GDP. But, its not jsut the trade imbalance. It is what the US imports from Europe. It is very hard to get the average guy on the street excited about how much the latest German luxury car costs, or the average women the price of Prada handbags.

&gt; US has a trade deficit with Canada amounting around $17 billion. Japan? $68 billion.

And we don't have to underwrite their defense, do we? TBH, that is the part that gets me. Europe runs a huge trade surplus with the US, then professes poverty when it comes to paying for European defense.

&gt;According to your own arguments, those other allies suck.

No, they do what they agreed to do when they signed the treaty.

&gt;The US gets a safe EU out of NATO, which is good for their economy. The US gets an EU they have control and influence over.

No, the trade deficit alone offsets any economic value. And, the US does not seem to get any influence over Europe for the money we pay for NATO. And we should not have that influence. FFS, Europe, grow up, and start accepting the responsibilities of adult-hood. And that includes honoring treaty commitments. If you don't want to pay that much, then get out of NATO.

&gt;in turn the EU listens to US voices. The US has a voice in Europe because you let us use your big dick.

Now, this is just getting infantile. Is Europe an adult, or a child? Does it require special financial support? Is it capable of entering into treaties that require domestic efforts?

&gt; Russia is your geopolitical opponent, by the way.

They wish. No, Russia is, at most, a regional threat. It is not the USSR, the Cold War is over, and Europe has to handle its neighbors on its own.

&gt;you see the irony in this, right?

Irony? No, the word is [hypocrisy.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/24/donald-trump-europe-border-walls-migrants/532572002/)

&gt;some parallels with Europe in the past and the US now

As Tom Wolfe famously said, ""The dark spectre of fascism is always falling in the US, but only ever lands in Europe."" Which is another reason we laugh at you guys. Trump is not a fascist, in any sense of the word. He is a populist and an ass, but he is not Hitler.

&gt;Republicans aren't Nazi's, but it's a warning that something like Nazism can happen.

You just cannot help yourself. You are so vested in all US Republicans being the worst of all possible people, that you cannot even comprehend that there may be 100 million people who do not share your political views, but are still decent human beings. And I vote Democrat more than Republican!

Europe's problems are Europe's, and I think expecting the US to always be there to bail Europe out is unrealistic. Sadly, I think that the US and Europe are drifting apart philosophically. And, as immigration to the US is more and more from Aisa, Europe is just less important to Americans as the years pass.

cookiedoughscoop,1542156564.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2leyae57,False,"My ex-boyfriend \[22M\] was identical. Everything that was not a hamburger, hot dog, chicken, or steak would provoke gagging to the point of theatrics. His ""no"" list even included pasta and cheese. I am the complete opposite; I am a big foodie and adore eating healthy and cooking. My primary diet is fruit, vegetables, and pasta (with cheese). Dating him prevented me from fulfilling my typical healthy diet, and my family (all from Italy) immediately had a vendetta against him because the texture of pasta does not meet his standards.

&amp;#x200B;

So - here's what I did. I managed to get him to try and like more foods than his mother ever has. It is a tedious yet immensely rewarding process. I began a running list of every new food that he tried and liked, and adding to the list became like a game to him. It's tough to make eating new foods fun for picky eaters, but posing it as a self-competition can be incentivizing.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my best tips &amp; recipe ideas for growing his ""new foods"" list:

* Find the ""**gateway**"" **vegetable**. A generalized distaste for vegetables suggests that he does not like the idea of vegetables, rather than the vegetable group itself. Offer different types of vegetables that he hasn't tried before with *fun twists*. I thought for sure that asparagus wrapped with bacon would do the trick, though my ex's gateway ended up being chicken lettuce wraps with rice noodles. He enjoyed them so much at a Korean restaurant that he actually wanted to order them again! I posed it to him as a variant of a chicken burger to appeal to him.
   * [Asparagus wrapped with bacon](https://fitfoodiefinds.com/bacon-wrapped-asparagus/)
   * Roasted [brussel sprouts](https://togetherasfamily.com/oven-roasted-parmesan-brussel-sprouts/) with parmesan cheese
   * Stir fry. Chicken/beef and rice to start to find a sauce he likes. Once you have established a sauce he likes, add 1 new veggie each time you make stir fry.
   * [Half-veggie burgers](https://www.platefullofgrace.com/burger-night-done-light/)
   * [Chicken lettuce wraps](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/asian-chicken-lettuce-wraps/)
* **Fruits**. What's easier with fruit than vegetables is that they require minimal preparation . **Always introduce with a food he likes!**
   * [Pineapple bacon burgers](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14496/pineapple-bacon-burgers/)
   * Melon and prosciutto
   * Apples and peanut butter
   * [Strawberry nutella crepe](https://www.handletheheat.com/sweet-crepes-with-nutella-strawberries/)
   * [Peanut butter, banana, and bacon toast](https://abc.go.com/playlists/null/video/VDKA3677996) (can eventually substitute almond butter for healthier alternative)
* **Other**. My biggest enemies here were pasta and cheese. I still cannot fathom how someone can completely reject both of these wonderful things. Cheese would make him gag, while pasta was a disagreeable texture (""too wiggly""). Here's what I did to gradually introduce him to pasta and cheese and condition a positive neural response to both foods, and I recommend modeling this approach for any similar food enemies.
   * Explored different types of pasta. His complaint was the wiggly texture because it felt ""slimy"" in his mouth, so I went out with him and **allowed him to choose** which pasta shapes he thought were fun and I guided him to the ""less wiggly"" ones, namely rigatoni and gnocchi. The rigatoni he did not take to. However, the  **gnocchi** paired with my grandmother's recipe for homemade meatballs was a game changer.
   * I started cooking gnocchi more regularly. He wouldn't eat it with sauce or cheese (though it was attempted), but he couldn't see what was inside the meatballs. **I began adding cheese to the meatballs** and would increase the amount of cheese with each batch. He did not know I added cheese for the second serving of meatballs.
   * Incredibly, he remarked that they were even better than the first (non-cheese) meatballs served, and when I told him that I added cheese, he was in disbelief! Incrementally increasing the quantity of cheese in the meatballs eventually increased his cheese tolerance.

I was still working on incorporating cheese into other dishes when we broke up because I was moving to Europe. Good luck!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**; the strategies are...

* Make it seem like it's his choice. Let him pick out the food or pair ""approved"" foods with new foods.
* Trick him. Sounds malevolent in theory, but food aversion is often visual. Mixing cheese into a meatball recipe or serving a combo of tofu nuggets + chicken nuggets circumvents any visual repulsion. Making meals from scratch gives you a lot of sneaky opportunities.

&gt;‚ÄúThe rhetoric from Trump‚Äôs team is misinformation, and it is not true,‚Äù said Gerard Mannion, a professor of Catholic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington.

&gt;**‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt all surrounded by walls, and it‚Äôs not like you need a separate visa or a passport to enter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt know, almost, when you even entered Vatican City. There is a white line painted on the ground in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, but that kind of thing is not obvious everywhere.‚Äù**

&gt;There are, to be sure, formidable walls in Vatican City, and much of of the site, including the gardens and the modest guesthouse that is home to Francis, is set behind them. But the walls do not entirely enclose the city-state, and in the modern era they are not meant to, historians said.

He always emphasizes the emotional aspect of relations between nations, between himself and other leaders. This is very productive for policy, to get things moving. 

Trump is a real American. You can find a dozen Clintons and Obama's in the legal or finance department of any midsize European company. It's just your standard materialist intellectual elitist, same all over the world. But there is noone like Trump or like many Republican politicians, in the Netherlands.

The American spirit is very nice. It's much a childlike spirit, but it does not mean Americans are like children. You just have your normal adult emotions, and then you have some national feeling on the side. The Dutch spirit is much defined by the absence of it. It's always an embarassment for me to see the display of the Dutch national spirit. Think of a scientist trying to do hip hop, is what it looks like. 

But I fear Trump is not a historic president yet, turning the tide of history, he may be the last of the great American presidents. To be historic he needs to deal with materialism. A large segment of the USA population are now materialists, bereft of the American spirit, inclined to socialism. Materialists deny free will is even real, because that way they can avoid the notion of the immaterial human spirit making the choice. It is now popular among materialists to redefine the meaning of free will, so that having made a choice, it means you could not have done otherwise. (so total craziness is now the norm in college) 

The thing is that in school and college curriculum, students solely learn about how things are forced, cause and effect. That is what is feeding the materialist and socialist eclipse of America. So if Mike Pence would start a conversation about teaching in school about how choices are made, then Trump's presidency has the potential of becoming historic.

How does the presence of a tracking pixel mislead me into thinking I'm not being tracked?

&gt;Good. Should it be legal for ""IRS"" phone scammers to run their scams simply because the person they are scamming agreed to do the Western Union money transfer? They were ignorant of the fact that the IRS would never contact them in such ways, or make such requests, but as you say, ignorance is not an excuse. That makes these scams a-ok, I suppose.

Once again, Google putting clearly-visible tracking code in no way misleads you into thinking you're not being tracked.

If the scammer says ""I am scamming you"", and you don't listen to him, and send him the money anyway, then yes, that is a legal interaction.

Again, as I said, even if you provide *full informed consent* to some things, it is not allowed under GDPR. Perhaps you are subscribing to a hypothetical cloud storage service, and you want to save money by having your data be stored unencrypted on a cheaper server out of the EU. If I am made *fully aware* of the potential risks of such an interaction (with lots of ""WARNING!"" popups or whatever), why are companies not allowed under GDPR to provide me with the option to opt out of their safe data handling procedures to save money?

&gt;When consumers are being misled, it is because it directly benefits corporate interests. The corporations use their position of power/authority to mislead and tell lies of omission. The corporations only have the power to do this because they are not being adequately supervised and regulated by the peoples' government.

Any individual has the power to put tracking pixels on their site. This is not a conspiracy by the rich and powerful.

That‚Äôs not contradictory, though. There was an historical contradiction but that wasn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs the Bible that is contradictory. If you go look at the historical sources (and actually took some time to study history) you‚Äôd see that the Abolition movement was strongly linked to religion - *but so was its opposition*. Religion is astoundingly contradictory, so for every stanza which seemingly is against slavery you can find one that seemingly supports it. In fact, because the ancient levant had slaves, *as did all of the Mediterranean basin*, you can find MORE biblical sources that support slavery than are against. 

[Here‚Äôs a Wikipedia article on slavery and the Bible.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery) Keep in mind the Bible tells you how much to charge for slaves, how to treat them, etc.

[Here‚Äôs a source from 1850, written by a slave owner, explaining why abolitionists cannot use the Bible to oppose slavery.](http://fair-use.org/debows-review/1850/09/slavery-and-the-bible) The argument can be summarized as ‚Äúthe Bible doesn‚Äôt say slavery is bad - if it was, or if it was something god cared about it would‚Äôve come up. It doesn‚Äôt, the opposite comes up.‚Äù

To both the abolitionist and the slaver they backed their point of view with the Bible. [John Brown is marching on glory glory hallelujah](https://youtube.com/watch?v=jso1YRQnpCI), but so is the confederate - god wants him to be free. There‚Äôs a certain ‚Äúhumour‚Äù about that. Not haha funny but *funny*. 

You cannot use the Bible to oppose slavery. Hate to break it to you but the slave owners are correct. [The Bible, and the Abrahamic God are okay with slavery.](https://youtu.be/r7Ht05pZ6vI?t=51) Religion has never been a good source of morals. 

The rest of your post comes from ignorance of history as well. *America is more racist than Europeans?* Europeans couldn‚Äôt hold slaves in Europe - but they were free to the minute they left Europe. The majority of slaveships were Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch. Europeans don‚Äôt seem racist because most European countries didn‚Äôt have minority populations until thirty years ago. And look at what‚Äôs happening now in Europe. Look at the politicians being elected. 

Where in Italy are you from? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure when southern Italians sing Tammurriata Nera they aren‚Äôt being friendly. 

There was, however, a MAJOR CONTRADICTION from the start. ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, **that all man are created equal**, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are **Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.**‚Äù Some describe this as the greatest sentence of the English language. And indeed, when the Declaration was published many people did realize the hypocrisy and immediately freed their slaves - not enough though. The consensus in America was that slavery wasn‚Äôt economically viable. That it would run its course and end by itself in a few decades without interference. This changes with the Gin and the Cotton is King maxim of the American south. Though in the North it did run its course and was outlawed. 

---

I hope this post doesn‚Äôt make it sound like I‚Äôm defending either racism or slavery - I‚Äôm not. When I was in college I took several classes just on the civil war. We had to learn all about the political and social ethos of both camps. I had to write quite a few papers on the northern arguments and their faults and the same for the south. It‚Äôs been a while since those papers but still. 

Also, in case you aren‚Äôt aware, the US outlawed the trans-Atlantic slavetrade in 1808. All salves had to be sourced locally afterward. This is long before the Portuguese did in Brazil. Not that that‚Äôs really an accomplishment. And it was in no way a relief for those enslaved.

srelma,1379356821.0,,,[],,3‚àÜ,dark,text,t2_d6dkx,False,"&gt; Pick any time period in recorded human history. Pick any region of the world. (assuming it was inhabited during that period) You're going to find examples of a culture that solved its problems through violence, on some scale. 

Western Europe post-WWII. Interestingly the time it has been a) under democratic rule and b) formed a union between the countries. That's probably the longest continuous peaceful time in Europe's history. At the same time the Eastern side (the authoritarian rule) had several conflicts (Hungary, Czechoslovakia and finally Yugoslavia). 

&gt; Human beings are not inherently peaceful. We've had several thousand years to prove that. Democracy isn't some sort of objective Good, it isn't the universal direction of progress.

How many of those several thousand years we used democracy? How many times democracies have gone to war against each other? I think the only exception is Britain declaring war to Finland in WWII when the Soviet Union asked for it, but this is really clutching straws as there was basically no fighting. Democracy seems to be quite a remarkable antidote against fighting. 

&gt; Modern democracies have to deal with differing demographics and cultures within a fairly limited scope. Ultimately most cultures within a population are mostly similar.

Not necessarily. I already mentioned Switzerland, which is probably the longest federal system. It's extremely stable even though it is composed of 4 language groups. For religion it has catholics and protestants. The US is another good example how a federal system can work even when there's no national identity the same way as there are in countries with much longer history. 

&gt;Increase the scale and you increase the diversity, and when you have a single source of authority making decisions that apply to the whole, you subsequently also see increased dissent to those decisions.

And that's exactly why a centrally controlled authoritarian empire wouldn't work. That doesn't mean that a federal system wouldn't. 

&gt; And if, following your example, California says no?

Ok, what would have happened in the US if Californians had said no to Iraq war? (It's not a very good example as the Californian senators were split on the decision, but let's ignore that now). Do you think the US would have broken down? I don't think so. The constitution was on the side of the federal decision and so even most Californians would have accepted that. And if Californians had refused, pretty much all the others would have been in favour of forcing California to participate. And that's how the federal system is supposed to work. The issues that have been agreed to be decided on a federal level can be enforced. However, if the federal government tries to enforce things that it shouldn't enforce, then the army is not likely to obey as those orders would be illegal. 

&gt;  Look at countries that currently dissent against international law, the UN, and other major international alliances. Why would we expect conflict and dissent to decrease with an even more expansive system?

Of course, I'm not arguing that the current countries could form a federal system. That is absurd. I would expect similar criteria as the EU has now for its membership to be required before a country would be allowed to join the union. Furthermore, I would expect that the wealth gap between the rich and the poor countries would need to be smaller before a world government would become practical. One of the reasons EU is creaking from the seams and why Britain is leaving is that the East European countries are much poorer, which has lead to a mass migration. The world without borders would not work with current income distribution. But I'm not arguing for that. I'm arguing against the ""never"". I'd imagine that the current EU as a completely voluntary union of diverse European countries would have looked a very weird concept 200 years ago. 

&gt; What I mean to suggest is that major nations, even in times of relative peace have a historical trend of maintaining military and police forces beyond what might be considered strictly necessary. There's no reason to believe that a united government would reduce its capabilities to the extent you're suggesting.

Well, I guess we have to agree to disagree here. One reason for big countries to maintain bigger military than is strictly necessary to protect their own borders is to project power elsewhere. The world government would not need that. It would have no place outside of it to project the power. 

&gt; Would they?

Yes, because there would really be no need for a big military. The current military budgets get through only by mongering fear of outside threats. This would not work in a world federation. 

&gt; I think much of your argument is predicated on the assumption of the whole system, or at least a clear and irresistible majority, would sincerely work in the best interests of the whole before themselves.

Well, do the Americans vote for the whole in their federal elections? For some reason I always hear ""I will go to Washington to represent the interests of X state"". Yes, the representatives in the federal system would represent their voters, but as long as they would stay in the remit of the constitution, there's no problem. That's how the system is supposed to work. That's actually the thing that keeps the central government from accumulating too much power. 

&gt; Why vote out military leaders who espouse a large military when that force can then be used to bully your competitors or push your own agenda? 

Ok, why don't the poor states in the US vote into power a military leader who would send the army to rich states to take their wealth? You notice that this sounds completely absurd, doesn't it? 

Why does EU almost never make a decision that would bully one country? Even majority decisions are not that common and instead a consensus is often tried to be achieved (which of course leads to some stagnation from time to time, but this is definitely better than bullying). 

Yes, human nature is to improve his own lot, but in modern societies this is achieved much better by collaboration than bullying. Germany is much richer because it collaborates with France than it would be if it tried to conquer France and take all its wealth. 

&gt; Why would other members care about the subjugation of one if it's to their benefit? 

But it's not. It would be a drain of resources to keep the one country subjugated instead of letting them collaborate. Only in the case the one country would be causing trouble to others (say, by attacking them or breaking global rules), would it make sense to use force.

* Sometimes the EU protects worker's rights and human rights, which represent thorns in the sides of an ego maniacal ruling class which gets most of its feeling of self worth from a sense of infallibility or god-like power over the plebs
* People who have been raised to believe in the circular logic that anyone who is in power deserves to be in power because they are in power. There are just so many people like this
* People who think multi-millionaires or billionaires have their best interests at heart

* European tax-evasion crack down

* That weird Stockholm-Syndrome most of the elder population seems to suffer from, where they seemingly _want_ to have ignorant fascists in power, basically wishing for harder times


It's quite weird. Decades ago I moved over here from the EU and I have always been quite skeptical of the EU myself. It's obvious that there are many issues with it. I could even almost, maybe be convinced into thinking that a country leaving the EU might work out. BUT, all the reasons for this happening are just so bizarrely weird, non-issues, blatant misinformation, won't happen anyway, etc.

I never got it, I still don't get it. I can understand it and attempt to list the reasons, but I will never get it.

Worst of all, I think most of the people who took part in this vote only voted on that day and have tuned out again ever since. So they will probably just wander into this blindly and one day wonder why shit's fucked. 

I do not understand why people do not have a more natural inclination to distrust rich people. Not the 1%, but the 0.001%, the truly rich and truly powerful. You should immediately assume they are awful, awful people. Nobody gets hurt in that scenario, they are rich, so they don't care. But if you trust them and their motives for some inexplicable reason, you will create a society by the rich, for the rich, and nothing else.

If said rich people were for the EU, we would have never left, as they would not have campaigned against it. It sickens me to think that so few people have so much influence over so many lives, for no other reason than having tons of money.

You're comparing apples and oranges. Ukraine is neither a NATO nor an EU member.
But we're talking about the EU here, so let's forget about NATO for a minute. 

The mixed response is partly based on the fact that Ukraine hasn't been perceived as a clean-cut case in parts of Europe that were in good terms with Russia. Public opinion was a lot more divided compared to the US. Even Kissinger said Crimea is not Prague. 

&gt;I do not know whether these people are idealists, na√Øve or simply ignorant, but the fact remains that soft power will always be subservient to hard power, no less in the 21st century than in the past.

I completely disagree and I think people who overemphasize hard power are stuck in the past,  na√Øve or simply ignorant. History has shown again and again, that it is possible to overcome the mindset of ""having to keep the them in check"". However, that's a different topic.

bananabbozzo,1405851321.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_hhj0g,False,"&gt; Yes, but no prominent Scottish politicians were campaigning for leave, unless you count the UKIP bloke I guess?

The vast majority of people get their information from the TV. The rest do from the internet and Cambridge Analytica showed its ads UK-wide. Dark money was funneled through the Tories in Scotland. A good chunk of the local tories was for Brexit. So the fact that UKIP is next to non-existing locally doesn't make much of a difference.

&gt; That hasn't been proven at all, native flight is a thing, a lot of leavers in Essex probably lived in London a decade ago and many of England's famously multicultural cities didn't deliver the huge remain votes that were expected. I really don't care enough to argue it though, I agree that 92% White British Scotland would be just fine with immigration levels comparable to England's, after all you are just nicer, more welcoming people.

The gap between the 99% white british places and London and other places with a significant non-native presence is statistically significant and constant.

&gt; You're not going to try and claim that a new EU member wouldn't be expected to join the euro and schengen are you? Probably seeing as you think leaving the UK would be easy and you have more in common with someone from Warsaw than someone from Watford, I mean hey what's another comforting lie on top of that?

Being _expected_ to do something _after_ joining and _having_ to do something _before_ joining are two radically different propositions.
Not all EU members are in Schengen and the Euro, and there's nothing forcing them to change that.

The US will NEVER let their neighbor be even remotely capable of putting up a fight. They will squash it before it happens. Therefore I dont expect Canada to prioritize traditional military objectives.  We live beside a giant. We best keep them relatively content. 

NATO - Kind of proves my point. Alliances are and will be the way of the future. Especially medium sized countries that want to at least have somewhat of a deterence towards a US, China and maybe Russian threat.  This is sort of why there is a push for a central EU military. The thing is how would an alliance military handle individual sovereign state interests...that remains to be seen. I do expect alliances to form that do not involve US or China in the future. When I couldnt tell ya.  

Things change constantly. Canada needs a military but we also do have to be realists.

Benjji22212,1347216206.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_8yfwh,False,"The Manchester suspect has now been detained under the Mental Health Act. The Mayor of that city, Andy Burnham, has oddly declared that the event had ‚Äòall the hallmarks of an isolated incident‚Äô (what are these hallmarks?). Some people (the police among them) assert that it was a terrorist incident, preponderantly a politico-religious act. Well, we shall see.

I cannot comment on the Manchester case any further, as it is too early to say any more than I have said, on the basis of the known and published facts. We must await the deliberations of the courts. 

But in some other past cases, there is evidence of self-deceiving circular thinking, brought on by a will to believe something which is so strong that it ignores all important facts.

Can a person be both mentally disturbed and capable of holding a political allegiance? Up to a point. Of course, it is perfectly possible for a person to be in some way mentally disturbed, and for that same person to embrace the slogans and chants of politico-religious movements. Indeed, psychiatrists are well aware of the person who tries to give his misery grandeur by adopting politico-religious positions. The question is, does this mean anything?

The extraordinary case of the (undoubtedly unhinged) Leyton knifeman, Muhiddin (sometimes Muhaydin) Mire is a good example of this. There are still people in authority who claim his action was political. Please read this https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2016/08/the-man-who-thought-tony-blair-was-his-guardian-angel-yes-really.html

Then decide if you think this belief is reasonable.

Those who read it will note the many clear references to his use of cannabis. But that is not all. Here are some extracts: 1. ‚ÄòBut I was very struck by the coverage on Tuesday, of the sentencing of the once-famous ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô threat, Muhiddin or sometimes Muhaydin Mire. It was a lot less prominent than the original huge media response to his original crime, a knife-attack on an innocent passer-by at Leytonstone Tube Station. Quite a lot of it still treated the action as if it was political. How on earth could they do this? It was revealed during the trial that Mire had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act as long ago as 2006‚Äô.

2.‚ÄúMire  ‚Äòwas put in touch with a community mental health team upon his release [from mental hospital], but soon lost contact with them and stopped taking the medication. In the years before the attack, Mire became increasingly unwell and was likely exhibiting symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, a serious mental illness for which he is now receiving treatment.

Among ‚Äústrange‚Äù ideas Mire had was a belief that former prime minister Tony Blair was his guardian angel and that he had been possessed by evil spirits, the court heard.‚Äù

Did you get that? He seriously and genuinely believed that Anthony Charles Lynton Blair,   invader of Iraq, was his personal guardian angel.

 

If anyone known to you seriously maintained such a thing, would you take any of his utterances on any subject seriously?

 

Now, to the second episode of the past few days, which was reported much less prominently (though imagine how it might have been reported had the suspect been said to have shouted ‚ÄòAllahu Akhbar!‚Äô). There is this account on the web:   https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-car-attack-suspect-man-charged-attempted-murder-police-far-right-bottrop-a8707536.html 

I learned of it through an interestingly different report in The Times of London. This is behind a pay wall, so I can only summarise it for you.   Here you are:

At least five people celebrating the New Year in a German town were injured by a driver who tried to ram pedestrians with his car.   
 
‚ÄòA child was hurt and a 46-year-old woman was left in a critical condition after they were struck by a silver Mercedes that drove into a crowd in the centre of Bottrop. Migrants from Syria and Afghanistan were also among the wounded.‚Äô

A local politician, Herbert Reul, alleged ‚ÄòThere was a clear intention to kill foreigners.‚Äô  A 50-year-old man from nearby Essen was arrested. Police said he displayed a ‚Äòxenophobic attitude‚Äô when they questioned him. They also said they believed he might be ‚Äòmentally ill‚Äô.

This BBC version also mentions the possibility that the driver may have been  mentally ill https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46730472

Well, you‚Äôd have to be pretty alert even to know this had happened, and I suspect that many events where no Islamist motivation can be suggested, or (more importantly, where *no* politico-religious motive *of any kind* can be suggested, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Times_Square_car_crash or https://www.thejournal.ie/tokyo-crash-4419164-Jan2019/  sink down into the bottom bits of newspapers,  websites and broadcast bulletins, barely noticed. Whereas the event in Manchester is prominently covered because the suspect is alleged to have used politico-religious slogans. If later trials reveal that supposedly political or religiously-motivated  attackers were in the grip of drugs, or mental illness, or both, this also tends to be rather lightly reported.

&gt; Delhi 2 Dublin was a happy accident born out of Vancouver's Celtic Fest in 2006. Their sound started as an electronic fusion between bhangra beats and Celtic fiddle and has since grown into anything from dub reggae to breaks to just straight up happy dance music. File under‚Ä¶ best.¬†

&gt; Founded by Tarun Nayar (of Beats Without Borders cred), Sanjay Seran (at the time hailing from live bhangra act Signia), and Ravi Binning (a professionally trained bhangra dancer and dhol player), the band started kicking ass on stages across North America, with violinist extremist Kytami and sitar/guitar hero Andrew Kim.¬†

&gt; Releasing their first full-length album out within a year of their inception, it was obvious D2D had something people wanted. Word spread about their ridiculously energetic live show, and tours grew from regular jaunts across the country and down through the States, to include festival performances in Europe, Asia and Australia. The band kept up with the pace, producing a new album bi-annually and a remix album alternating years.¬†
Ôøº
With seven albums out, 2014 has Delhi 2 Dublin releasing their very first, and much anticipated, LIVE album, recorded at the iconic Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver, BC on their 8th birthday. This year also brings about more additions to the D2D touring family: Serena Eades joins on violin (in lieu of fiddle player Sara Fitzpatrick starting a family of her own!) and James Hussain on guitar. Jaron Freeman-Fox continues being a featured guest at select shows, along with former member Andrew Kim.¬†

&gt; Described by one magazine as the ‚ÄúUnited Nations of rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll‚Äù, Delhi 2 Dublin has become one of Canada‚Äôs most buzzed-about bands, and this was not just a happy accident ‚Äì see for yourself what everyone's been dancing about: Live teaser from the Commodore

CharityStreamTA,1497746321.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4dz9xkx,False,"Manufacturing works using the lean engineering principle of JIT (Just In Time)

This method has been standard in the industry since it was popularised by Toyota.

Lean techniques essentially work by using a pull system rather than a push system to create goods. This means that you have the minimum possible inventory to see you through to the next delivery. 

With any brexit that fills brexiters requirements you will see disruption in supply chains at the borders. This is one of the definitions of brexit as we are taking back control of our borders for the import and export of goods and people. 

Any minor unplanned disruption to a supply chain can have devastating consequences. See the KFC chicken shortage, or any adverse weather and you'll notice how supply chains just break down with minor disruptions. 

So by definition, if our standards are not the exact same as the EU we will need checks on goods across the border to enforce these standards. We currently have free movement of goods due to EU standards and compliance which is the thing that means we do not do border checks. If we remove this the parts will be waiting at the border and the entire workshops and plants will have no work to do. 

The increase in productivity you are seeing is to try combat this. By having a larger stockpile of goods you can run for longer without having to shut down the plant but it is much more expensive to run as you need to store extra goods. In order to keep a single  manufacturing plant running for 12 weeks you would need more warehouse space than the four biggest warehouses in the UK.

Wenn ueberhaupt kann er nur eine Rot-Weiss-Rot Karte anfordern und ich weiss gar nicht ob er das ueberhaupt kann momentan weil das Gesetz naemlich so dumm geschrieben ist, dass er faktisch sogar keine Rechtsgrundlage hat als Staatenloser momentan in Oesterreich zu sein.

Das kannst du auch gerne mit Anwaelten besprechen, da gabs schon einige Diskussionen dazu (zB gibts nichtmal einen Rechtsanspruch auf einen Fremdenpass als Ex EU Buerger weil du keinen Aufenthaltstitel hast der aber benoetigt wird um sich einen ausstellen zu lassen).

Glaub mir. Das Gesetz ist echt frustrieren und voller Loecher. Ich bin selber momentan hals ueber Kopf in einem so einem aehnlichen Fall drin und es ist kein Spass.

&gt; Dann w√§re der Verweis auf die ""Notvignette"" unsinnig.

Faktisch ist er in einem Leerraum den der Gesetzgeber nicht glaub, dass er vorkommt (kommt aber immer wieder vor). Er darf das Land nicht verlassen und wenn ihn jemand kontrollieren wuerde (zB durch das Auslaenederbeschaefitungsgesetz) waere kann er nicht nachweisen, dass der rechtsmaessig im Land ist. Das selbe Problem haette er an der Grenze. Er muss auf jeden Fall zur Behoerde und eine Notvignette anfordern um wieder ins Land zu kommen. Mir ist bewusst, dass er keine Rechtsgrundlage dafuer hat aber ohne der kann der *gar nicht* raus.

They also seem to think the EU are the ones who need a deal... when they don't. I mean, it's painful for everyone if there's no deal, but if the UK want to leave and isolate themselves without a deal, the EU will just go on.

The deal the that UK seem to want, just plain won't happen. It can't. So the question is, if a deal is reached, what is the deal? Is it even any better than no deal at all?

I really wish I took more than 12 weeks off, but I'm in a niche field and concerned if I left the workforce, I wouldn't be able to get back in for commensurate location, salary, flexibility, etc. that I have now. 

I also felt extreme stress about going back to work when I felt so overwhelmed with a not exactly always helpful partner. For this reason, I also feel that paternity leave policies are also incredibly important. My husband owns his own business, so he went right back to work. That means everything fell to me. At 9 weeks, I couldn't compute how I could go back to work when carrying so much weight. 

It's not been almost a year, and yes as per my post, I'm still frustrated, but it's all doable! A big reason why I'm frustrated right now is because the first trimester is kicking my butt. That's why this has became an issue again. That tiredness coupled with anxiety about fitting in #2 in less than 30 weeks!

&gt;Freedom and slavery constitute an antagonism. There is no need for me to speak either of the good or of the bad aspects of freedom. As for slavery, there is no need for me to speak of its bad aspects. The only thing requiring explanation is the good side of slavery. I do not mean indirect slavery, the slavery of proletariat; I mean direct slavery, the slavery of the Blacks in Surinam, in Brazil, in the southern regions of North America.

&gt;Direct slavery is as much the pivot upon which our present-day industrialism turns as are machinery, credit, etc. Without slavery there would be no cotton, without cotton there would be no modern industry. It is slavery which has given value to the European colonies, it is the colonies which have created world trade, and world trade is the necessary condition for large-scale machine industry. Consequently, prior to the slave trade, the colonies sent very few products to the Old World, and did not noticeably change the face of the world. Slavery is therefore an economic category of paramount importance.

&gt;Without slavery, North America, the most progressive nation, would be transformed into a patriarchal country. Only wipe North America off the map and you will get anarchy, the complete decay of trade and modern civilisation. But to do away with slavery would be to wipe America off the map. Being an economic category, slavery has existed in all nations since the beginning of the world. All that modern nations have achieved is to disguise slavery at home and import it openly into the New World.

Yeah Kosovo and Albania are close but they do have different distinctive traits and cultures.

jpterpsfan,1464904142.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yeqcn,False,"&gt; [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) has yet to obtain approval from authorities in Europe to begin selling the Model 3 in the region, though this isn‚Äôt expected to impede the carmaker from starting deliveries next month, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company has been working in close collaboration with authorities and expects to receive certification after some personnel return from the holidays next week, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations aren‚Äôt public. This timing is in line with what Tesla has been targeting for months, the person said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting Model 3 deliveries in Europe is a key priority for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. He‚Äôs pointed to the sedan starting sales in Europe and China early this year as a key reason he isn‚Äôt concerned about any potential setback caused by the U.S. federal tax credit toward Tesla purchases halving to $3,750 as of Jan. 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tesla has previously obtained approval for safety, noise, environmental and production requirements through the Dutch regulator known as [RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/information-in-english). Under European Union rules, once an automaker‚Äôs new vehicle has been certified by one national authority, the approval is applicable [across the trade bloc](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/automotive/technical-harmonisation/faq-auto_en).  
&gt;  
&gt;The company has received systems-type approval for components of the vehicle, and is awaiting whole-vehicle type approval, which is expected to be imminent, the person said. Th√©r√®se de Vroomen, a spokeswoman for RDW, said the vehicle authority doesn‚Äôt provide information about its type approval process.  
&gt;  
&gt;Concerns about the shrinking U.S. tax credit and Tesla‚Äôs decision to cut prices by $2,000 to partially offset the lower incentive has sent the carmaker‚Äôs shares plunging about 9.4 percent during the first two trading days of the year. The company also reported fourth-quarter deliveries Wednesday that fell just short of analysts‚Äô estimates.

Dat het moeilijk is om een schifting te maken tussen gezond en ongezond voedsel kan ik nog wel begrijpen, toen ik jong was werden ook producten aangeprezen als gezond waarbij niet gezegd wordt dat het discutabel is. Een ananas is nog wel gezond, maar aan ananas in blik kan weer suiker toegevoegd zijn. Verse sperziebonen zijn daarentegen weer even gezond als hun bevroren of ingeblikte soortgenoten. De verpakking kan je dus niet als leidraad nemen, er zou eventueel naar de toevoegingen gekeken kunnen worden, maar daar zullen fabrikanten vast wel iets op verzinnen. Veel makkelijker zou het zijn om gewoon al het voedsel buiten de btw-heffing te laten.

Edit. Volgens de staatssecretaris moet op voedsel btw geheven worden. Volgens de eu richtlijn mag voor voedingsmiddelen een laag tarief gehanteerd worden, waarvan Nederland een 0% tarief voor bepaalde goederen hanteert (uit dezelfde lijst als waar voedingsmiddelen in staan).

I had braces and now I have a night retainer. My braces got taken off like a 4-6 years ago. Actually I had braces twice. I am 25 now. If I don't wear my retainer for three-four days, the two teeth (upper 2s) that were the most problematic move back a bit BUT IN A VISIBLE WAY towards their old problematic position. One week without retainer (forgot to bring with me on camping oops), and I could barely put it on, my teeth moved so much.

And now the question: WILL MY TEETH EVER FUCKING STABILISE? :'((((((((

&amp;#x200B;

Another question: Will asking an orthodontist to make me a new retainer (even based on the current form of my teeth, I don't care) cost me a lot? Will they do it? Obviously my retainer looks like complete shit by now (years of wear, grinding teeth, saliva, whatever don't do good to plastic). My last orthodontist refused to do it, that is when I got a second set of braces, only on my upper front 6 or 8 teeth, taken of, new retainer. Since then, that retainer also looks like shit. She refused to create me a new retainer? 

I have been heavily considering just visiting another orthodontist and ask them to take that ""blueprint"" off my current teeth and make a retainer (or five) based on that, it is still better than nothing.

Securities market adjusted last year
It became clear that short-selling investors raised profit rate more than 20%.
Short sale borrows stock and sells,
then if stock price falls again buy back and return
It is an investment method to gain margins.
The greater the fall in stock price, the higher the rate of return.
 
According to the 2nd financial investment industry last year
of short-selling investors (January 2 - December 27, 2018)
Securities market ¬∑ Kosdaq market Market capitalization top 788 events
Evaluation rate of return was calculated on average 20.52%.
This rate of return is the result of comparing the short sale price
(short selling price / short sale transaction amount)
for this period with the closing price on December 28 last year.
While securities markets fell 17.28% last year,
short-selling investors opposed a high rate of return.

Selling bomb ... IT and biotech stock plummet.
http://news.hankyung.com/article/2019010396691

Kospi 2000 line collapse ... the first time in 25 months
Samsung Electronics 2.9% ¬∑ Sertelion leaving 1.8%
""Apple shock"" overlapping bad materials
Degraded investment psychology ... Domino ""Destiny""

""Momentum of the growing market ... If you do not deal with defensive stocks""
 
 
The line of KOSPI index 2000 broke again.
The 3-day KOSPI index fell 16.30 points (0.81%) at the 1993.70 deal.

It was the first time in 2 months since last October 29 (1996.05)
that 2000 broke down on the closing price basis.

The KOSPI index of this day, after December 7, 2016 (1991.89)

The lowest value was recorded for the first time in 25 months.

China's economic indicators announced the previous day are worse than expected and concerns about the economic slowdown have increased,
A representative information technology (IT) company in the United States,
While Apple reduced the actual estimate for the first quarter
(October - December 2018)

It is an analysis that investment psychology sharply declined.
 
The lowest value for the first time in 25 months.

On this day the KOSPI index threatened the institutional investor's 'destiny'
offensive at the exchange place, but barely rebounded toward t
he end of the foreign buying trend.

The institution delivered a total
of 168.4 billion won (about 149.61 million US dollars)
on this day and spilled out four consecutive trading day bombs.

During this period the institution sold
1.18 trillion won ( about 1,048,832 million US dollars) stock.
 
Especially the institution delivered net proceeds
of 107 billion won (about 9.56 million US dollars)
even on this day futures market.
We set a direction with net purchase
of 340.2 billion won (about 322.3 million US dollars) the previous day.

Selling Kospi 200 futures means looking at the prospects
of the domestic securities market badly.
 
Information technology (IT) stocks and bio declined steeply.

Samsung Electronics 37,600 - 2.97% finished trading
at 37,600 won (about 33.40 US dollars) which fell
by 1150 won (about 1.02 US dollar 2.97%),
SK Hynix 57, 700 - 4.79% (- 4.79%),
Sertorion 210, 500-1.86% (- 1.86%) and other declines were also large.
 
Fund managers,
""A rumor that an asset management company that showed strengths
in IT and biotechnology industries put out properties and organized funds
that related stocks were adjusted, other institutions pre-populated
the property and the range of declines has increased."" did.
 
Concern over the global economic downturn is increasing.
In China, the Manufacturing Purchasing Officer Index (PMI)
in December last year fell to the lowest since February 2016,
and Chinese exports declined by 13.9% last year,
China's exports declined 13.9% compared with the same period
of the previous year, the Chinese economy has suddenly broken .
 
The fact that Apple lowered the actual estimate the day before also put fire
on deteriorating investment psychology.
John Gyeong de Macquarie Investment Trust Investment Equity Investment
Management Operations Headquarters analyzed,
""Apple and other companies' estimates for other companies
are also beginning to decline,
investment psychology is not good and bad materials overlap
and flooded selling.""
 
 
Utility communication stock etc are evacuation centers ""

It is an expert's analysis that repulsion is difficult for a while.
It is chosen for the greatest reason that the outlook
for Korean companies' performance is bad.
According to Yuhit Securities, the estimated value of operating profit
in the fourth quarter of the securities market-listed companies
was down 10.1% from the previous month.
This year's operating profit forecast also declined 5.5% over the same period.
 
Lee Jin Umeritz General Financial Securities Research Fellow
""The performance perspective of the market as a whole will be lower,
not individual enterprises and industries, where the forecasts
at a rate similar to the time of the financial crisis in 2008 have been low.""
 
Outside bad materials are as usual.
Kim Yeun IBK investment researcher
""US-China trade dispute, Bregjit (withdrawal from the UK's European Union)
uncertainty, shutdown of the US federal government
(suspension of temporary work) prolonged
It is a difficult situation to embark on poor investment that must keep
in mind the fluctuations caused by such things. ""
 
Experts advised that it would be better to invest in defensive shares in bonds,
shares than stocks.
Cheiseokwon SK Securities Research Center Director
""It deserves interest in industries that move on the theme regardless
of indices such as hydrogen cars, liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships, utilities,
communications etc. that could be evacuation centers.""

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00204-017-1962-5

where the first is outright critical of the article you've posted, and the second talks about EU policy and whether the chemical is a risk to people who consume parts of it in their food. But back to your paper: the authors mention right at the beginning

&gt; Celiac disease, and, more generally, gluten intolerance, is a growing problem worldwide, but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. 

Notice how this is left completely uncited. Is celiac really growing? Or are we just getting better at recognizing it? Also, the 5% figure is ridiculous! What does the 'it' refer to? Celiac? Gluten Insensitive? Look at some meta-analysis estimates for celiac:

https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(17)30783-8/fulltext - 95% CI: [1.1%, 1.7%]

&gt; The prevalence values for celiac disease were 0.4% in South America, 0.5% in Africa and North America, 0.6% in Asia, and 0.8% in Europe and Oceania; the prevalence was higher in female vs male individuals (0.6% vs 0.4%; P &lt; .001). The prevalence of celiac disease was significantly greater in children than adults (0.9% vs 0.5%; P &lt; .001).

This article gives cited figures for non-celiac gluten sensitivity:

&gt; The overall prevalence of NCGS in the general population is still unknown, mainly because many patients are currently self-diagnosed and start a gluten-free diet (GFD) without medical advice or consultation [6]. The disorder seems to be more common in females and in young/middle age adults [6]. Some authors think that the incidence of NCGS seems to be higher than CD and WA, its estimated numbers reaching 0.63‚Äì6% of the population [5], [10], [11], [12].

I'm pretty sure 0.63 - 0.66 is what they mean, since 0.63-6 is a *huge* estimate bound. But if we base our estimate on people with just IBS we get a much higher estimate of its prevalence:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508515000293

&gt; The analysis of the epidemiology of IBS provides an indirect and probably biased estimate of intestinal NCGS frequency. According to recent population-based surveys
performed in Northern Europe, the prevalence of IBS in the
general adult population is 16%‚Äì25%.38 In a selected (and
therefore probably biased) series of adults with IBS, the
frequency of NCGS, documented by a double-blind, placebocontrolled challenge, was 28%.39 In the large study performed by Carroccio et al, 276 of 920 (30%) subjects with
IBS-like symptoms, according to the Rome II criteria, had
wheat sensitivity or multiple-food hypersensitivity (including
wheat sensitivity)

Notice how this is an estimate of people with gluten sensitivty *given* IBS. Anyways, interesting stuff and I will have to look around for more!

&gt;Disraeli, the Jew Prime Minister of England, and Leader of the Conservative Party, who was always true to his race and proud of his origin, said on a well-known occasion: ‚ÄúThe Lord deals with the nations as the nations deal with the Jews.‚Äù Certainly when we look at the miserable state of Russia, where of all countries in the world the Jews were the most cruelly treated, and contrast it with the fortunes of our own country, which seems to have been so providentially preserved amid the awful perils of these times, we must admit that nothing that has since happened in the history of the world has falsified the truth of Disraeli‚Äôs confident assertion...

&gt;...With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek ‚Äì all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. **The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people.**


There's a very interesting book called; *""The Russian Roots of Nazism: White √âmigr√©s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945""* that details how the European/Jewish ethnic conflict from the Soviet Union spilled over into Germany;


&gt;The signiÔ¨Åcance of substantial White emigre inÔ¨Çuences on Hitler‚Äôs Weltanschauung has become more apparent since Brigitte Hamann convincingly argued in her 1996 work, Hitlers Wien: Lehrjahre eines Diktators (Hitler‚Äôs Vienna:Apprentice Years of a Dictator),that **Hitler was not yet anti Semitic during his ‚Äúhunger years‚Äù in Vienna from 1908 to 1913. He even defended the Jews in intense political arguments with those who denounced them.**11 Hamann‚Äôs book refutes the earlier historical consensus which had contended that Hitler developed an acutely anti-Semitic world-view during his time in Vienna.12


&gt;**Further indications of the relatively late development of Hitler‚Äôs far right political ideas exist. Hitler‚Äôs correspondence and private writings from World War I (1914‚Äì1918) lack anti-Semitic passages.13 Hitler‚Äôs comrades during World War I did not detect anti-Semitic views among his beliefs.14 Moreover, according to Aide-de-Camp Hans Mend, Hitler‚Äôs immediate commanding ofÔ¨Åcer on the Western Front in World War I, Hitler occasionally praised Jews, and he exhibited socialist leanings. He often held ‚Äúrabble-rousing speeches‚Äù in which he called himself a representative of the ‚Äúclass-conscious proletariat.‚Äù** 15 Hitler only began to crystallize his virulent anti-Bolshevik, anti-Semitic Weltanschauung in Munich in late 1919 in the context of intercultural collaboration between alienated volkisch Germans and radical White emigres.

One has to wonder if Imperial Russia not falling to the Reds would have prevented Nazism rising, ww2 and the jewish holocaust.

Because those reds clearly influenced Hitler's extremism as he cited the example of Russia as ""the most terrible example of slavery"" in the world:

&gt;**Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such a slavery. In that country the Jew killed or starved thirty millions of the people, in a bout of savage fanaticism and partly by the employment of inhuman torture.** And he did this so that a gang of Jewish literati and financial bandits should dominate over a great people.

The Red Holocausts are all too often glossed over. Horrific genocides that are denied often, but were man-made for political reasons [first in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%9322&amp;oldid=662607297)


&gt;The Russian famine of 1921, also known as Povolzhye famine, was a severe famine in Bolshevik Russia which began in early spring of 1921 and lasted through 1922. This famine killed an estimated 6 million, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions.[1][2][3]

&gt;In Lenins's secret letter to the Politburo, Lenin explains that the famine provides an opportunity against the church. The Harvard historian Richard Pipes argued that the famine was used politically as an excuse for the Bolshevik leadership to persecute the Orthodox Church, which held significant sway over much of the peasant populace. Pipes also considers the possibility that Lenin actually welcomed the famine as it weakened the peasantry and prevented the peasants from resisting the Bolsheviks.

""Revolutionary"" leader Leon Trotsky wrote letters mocking starving peasants, telling them to ""get back to him when they are eating their children, [and we have proof that they did this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4076244/Distressing-photos-1920s-Russian-famine-turned-hopeless-peasants-cannibals-five-million-people-starved-death.html)

Again [Kazakhstan was Holomdored by this extremist leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333)

&gt;The Kazakh famine of 1930‚Äì1933, known in Kazakhstan as the Goloshchekin genocide was a man-made famine where 1.5 million (possibly as many as 2.0‚Äì2.3 million) people died in Soviet Kazakhstan, of whom 1.3 million were ethnic Kazakhs; 38% of all Kazakhs died, the highest percentage of any ethnic group killed in the Soviet famines of the early 1930s.[8][2]

&gt;The famine made Kazakhs a minority in the Kazakh ASSR, and not until the 1990s did Kazakhs become the largest group in Kazakhstan again. Before the famine, around 60% of the republic's population were Kazakhs, but after the famine, only around 38% of the population were Kazakhs.[3][4][5][6]

Kazakhs named the genocide after him.

&gt;He is best known for his involvement in the Execution of the Romanov Family, as well as for the deadly role which he played in the Sovietization of Kazakhstan, (Small October), (Russian: –ú–∞–ª—ã–π –û–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—å, a reference to the ""Great October""), **better known within Kazakhstan as the ""Goloshchekin Genocide"".**

&gt;**From 1925 to 1933 he ran the Kazakh ASSR with virtually no outside interference as a local dictator.** He played a prominent part in the construction of the Turkestan-Siberian railway, which was constructed to open up Kazakhstan's mineral wealth....

&gt;A historian of the revolution, V.L. Burtsev, who knew Goloshchyokin, characterized him as such:

&gt;&gt;This is a typical Leninist. This is a man who does not stop the blood. This trait is especially noticeable in his nature: the executioner, cruel, with some elements of degeneration. In party life he was arrogant, was a demagogue, a cynic. **He did not count the Kazakhs as people at all.** Goloshchekin did not have time to appear in Kazakhstan, **as he stated that there is no Soviet power, and it is ""necessary"" to orchestrate a ""Small October"".**

&gt;Statements have been made that, in seven years, he never went outside the capital and was not interested in how the people lived, and did not correspond to reality. In April 1931, Goloshchyokin traveled only ten districts. The handling of collectivization and ""dekulakization"" under his leadership in Kazakhstan is remembered with a mixed feeling of hatred and horror by the Kazakh people.

&gt;He is also often referred to as Shaya Goloshchekin (–®–∞—è) by the diminutive from the name Isay in Yiddish. ""Filipp"" was his party cryptonym.

The latter may tick upwards and thaw some this year, but longer term there is a fundamental antagonism at work between China's desire to rapidly drive their productive forces up the value chain and shift to an advanced manufacturing economy and the United States' competitive position in that very realm. The immediate terms of the conflict are something both sides could back off on, but longer-term either China has to say ""we're okay depending on Europe and the US for advanced tech and being a lower-level manufacturing center"" or the US has to say ""we're okay giving up our primacy in technological production."" Sooner or later that's going to express itself, and I think Cohn (oops I mean Ross) and Lighthizer are betting that this is the last and best chance to head China off at the pass here. They are probably right--the US economy is relatively strong and stable right now and China is still early enough in its movement towards this that it's feasible that they could be beat. Navarro gets into the mix as a crackpot with the ear of the man that can unilaterally fuck shit up on this topic and it makes the whole situation incredibly volatile.

As for Brexit, you have the world's second largest economy jettisoning 15% of its economic power, and the world's 5th largest economy (if you shift from looking at the EU as a single economy) throwing up massive new barriers between itself and its most important trading partner, probably knee-capping their most significant economic drivers as well. The politics are internally contradictory in a profound way and the most likely scenario at this point seems to be a no-deal exit--it'll either be this or gross internal political chaos in the UK.

In the 20th century, most socialist states used planning to distribute resources. In the 1950s, GOSPLAN (which was the Soviet planning bureau) had control of some 30,000 individual products: how much was needed, how much they cost, etc. So it has been done. The problem was that by the late 1960s there were then several million distinct products circulating in the Soviet economy -- way more than the few thousand planners employed at GOSPLAN could calculate -- so the system underwent market reforms. But the Soviets didn't have modern supercomputers back then, so today the calculation problem is easy. Von Mises thought this wasn't possible but he was wrong.

The Soviets also had money, but a lot of socialists have wanted to move to a labor-token or labor-credit system. This means that everything costs the number of hours of work put into it (there is no profit in this system). If a pair of jeans took two hours to make, then those are ""two hour jeans."" There wouldn't be price tags at the store for goods but *units of time*. For every hour you work, you get a token which can be exchanged for goods. You get back what you put in, because under socialism everyone has an equal obligation to work. Of course, you could adjust the ""price"" of goods if they don't sell. So a pair of jeans that goes out of fashion can be marked down to ""30 minute jeans"" or whatever you like (all calculated automatically via algorithms). 

And once you use a labor credit, that credit would evaporate on the spot, like a movie ticket. It's one-use only. Back in the 19th century, some socialist thinkers imagined using hole-punch cards in place of a paycheck, with the idea being you'd go into the store and the shopkeepers would punch out the hours worked in exchange for goods. Edward Bellamy, an American socialist, wanted people to shop in giant ""horns of plenty"" (like giant supermarkets designed like palaces) where they'd order goods using their cards, and then the goods would deliver straight to their home using pneumatic tubes. Today we have Amazon.

&gt;How is scarcity of resources addressed? 

I wouldn't rule out market-based solutions for this. For instance, toll roads are common in capitalist economies to address scarcity of road space. I envision a mix. I would like as much planning as possible with modern computers, but I'm sure scarcity is still going to exist for various things. Some European and Latin American cities are so congested these days they use rationing and ""no car days.""

&gt;How do you prevent the majority imposing its will against the minority?

No, I want that, in the sense that I want the working class -- which comprises the majority of the population -- to take power, repress the bourgeoisie and establish a socialist democracy. This is ""authoritarian"" in a sense, but it's no more authoritarian than what the bourgeoisie did when it established the modern nation-state and pioneered the development of capitalism. (The French executed their nobles with a guillotine.)

But there are various controversies that develop here and there aren't any easy answers. Most attempts at creating socialist systems have found themselves immediately under attack by capitalist regimes. In these emergency circumstances, a dictator takes charge to defend the revolution from attack. But now you've got a dictator which smothers the democratic forces within the revolution, which is unfortunate and is one of the lessons of the 20th century that socialists will have to study. I should note that I don't find a dictatorship to be a desirable outcome.",True,False,False,,0,1546552093,,1546553708,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed6grha,False,t3_acaa0u,False,t3_acaa0u,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/acaa0u/how_are_resources_distributed_under_socialism/ed6grha/,,1550833114,2,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,r/CapitalismVSocialism,public,

Morocco sought to create a relationship with the US in 1777 by allowing them to freely enter Moroccan ports, recognizing the US as an independent country and later on in 1786 they signed a a friendship treaty (which is the longest unbroken treaty the US has) with the United States:

&gt; On 20 December 1777, Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah commissioned the Dutch consul in Sal√© to write letters to the European merchants and consuls in Tangier, Sal√©, Larache and Mogador stating that vessels sailing under the American flag could enter Morocco's ports, alongside those of European countries with which Morocco had no diplomatic ties, such as Russia and Prussia, under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the nations that had treaty relations.[3] Information about the Sultan's desire for friendly relations did not reach Benjamin Franklin, the American emissary to the Kingdom of France in Paris before April 1778 at the earliest.[3] In 1777, Morocco became the first nation to officially recognize the independence of the United States[4][5] ‚Äî but that ""recognition"" did not include the necessary treaty nor the exchange of ambassadors, only the admission of American ships.[6] Sultan Sidi Muhammad Ibn Abdullah actively sought to have an American diplomat negotiate a formal treaty, but meanwhile Moroccan pirates threatened American merchant shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, Thomas Barclay, the American consul in France, arrived in Morocco in 1786. There he negotiated the Moroccan‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Friendship which was signed later that year in Europe by American diplomats John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and ratified by the Confederation Congress (under the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union government) in July 1787.[7]

&gt; One of the many letters between America and Morocco was one by first President George Washington to Muhammed Ibn Abdullah. On December 1, 1789, eight months into his presidency, Washington speaks on his authority and leadership of the United States and the miscommunication between Morocco and America. In the letter, Washington expresses his regrets in lack of punctuality but clarifies that the untimely response was due to change in government and the want to communicate on solidified terms. Washington also shows appreciation for Muhammed Ibn Abdullah's diplomatic initiative tactics in protection of American ships from pirates. These actions are appreciated because of the lack of power United States as a country had held at the moment. Morocco was one of the first Arab, African, Muslim states to sign a treaty with America.

Here's the fun part for me, the sources.

Here's some shit you may want to read, both modern and old, most of which still referenced by leaders around the world, which might give you a better understanding of the Russian mindset, and how geography shapes conflict and diplomacy:

*The Geographic Pivot of History*

Halford Mackinder is probably the person you want to start off with. He's one of the true fathers of geopolitics and discussed how geography can influence both regions and the world (and, was vehemently anti-Russia). 

&gt;In 1944, America‚Äôs Ambassador to Great Britain, John Winant, captured the essence of Mackinder‚Äôs accomplishment when he praised him for ‚Äúfully enlist[ing] geography as an aid to statecraft.‚Äù

You can read about him here:

https://kirkcenter.org/essays/mackinder-geography-and-history/

&gt;As Robert D. Kaplan recently wrote, ‚ÄúGeography is the backdrop to human history itself.‚Äù

&gt;That is why the geographical and geopolitical works of Halford Mackinder, which span the time period from 1887 to 1943, remain relevant to our twenty-first century world. 

&gt;Regimes come and go. Nations and empires rise and fall. Wars are won and lost. The global and regional balances of power shift over time. Only geography stays the same.

&gt;Mackinder‚Äôs most fundamental insight was that the political world is inseparable from the physical world. In a paper entitled ‚ÄúThe Scope and Methods of Geography,‚Äù written in 1887, he expressed the belief that political geography was ‚Äúbuilt upon and subsequent to physical geography.‚Äù ‚ÄúEverywhere,‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúpolitical questions will depend on the results of the physical inquiry.‚Äù

&gt;including Britain and the British Seas (1902), The Rhine (1908), Lands Beyond the Channel (1910), Eight Lectures on India (1910), and Distant Lands (1912). In these books and other writings, Mackinder showed how geography shaped the history of various regions of the world.

&gt;In 1919, after the cataclysmic First World War, Mackinder warned the statesmen of the West that the failure to adjust their democratic ideals to enduring geographical realities would result in another and more destructive global war. Twenty years later, when events confirmed the wisdom of that warning, Mackinder‚Äôs writings and ideas received more widespread attention. His 1919 book Democratic Ideals and Reality was reprinted in 1942. Life magazine did a feature story on his geopolitical theories. The editor of the influential journal Foreign Affairs invited Mackinder to update his geopolitical theories with a view toward the post-war world, which Mackinder did in 1943 in ‚ÄúThe Round World and the Winning of the Peace.‚Äù It would be Mackinder‚Äôs last published work on global geopolitics. He died four years later at the age of 86.

&gt;Mackinder‚Äôs influence on statesmen and international relations scholars, however, was greater after he died.

&gt;In 1975, Saul B. Cohen noted that ‚Äúmost Western strategists continue to view the world as initially described by Mackinder.‚Äù In 1980, Robert Nisbet wrote that ‚Äú[e]very geopolitical apprehension that ‚Ä¶ Mackinder expressed some six decades ago ‚Ä¶ has been fulfilled.‚Äù The National Defense University issued a reprint of Democratic Ideals and Reality in 1986. In 1988, the respected strategist Colin Gray asserted that [t]he geopolitical ideas of ‚Ä¶ Mackinder ‚Ä¶ provide an intellectual architecture, far superior to rival conceptions, for understanding the principal international security issues.‚Äù

And here:

&gt;Mackinder's theory also may have influenced Western powers' strategic thinking during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, as the Soviet Union had control over the former East Bloc countries. 

Or maybe he is, as you suggest, just some pro-Russian bot feeding Russian propaganda? Feeding pro-Russian idiots like myself? Hahahaha. Ok.

Mackinder was influenced by, and influenced several others in these fields: Nicholas J Spykman, Karl Haushofer, Alfred Thayer Mahan. Unfortunately, some of the innovators had their work distorted by later generations, as Nazi Germany abused these ideas for their own horrific worldview. But largely, these men have been redeemed by history, and are still referenced *today* in global politics, diplomacy, and military. Read their shit. It's good.
