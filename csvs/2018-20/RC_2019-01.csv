&gt; Roy Ayers (September 10, 1940) is an American funk, soul, and jazz composer and vibraphone player. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, which is a mixture of jazz into hip-hop and funk, and has been dubbed by many as ""The Godfather of Neo Soul"". He is most well known for his signature compositions ""Everybody Loves The Sunshine"" and ""Searchin"", and is also famous for having more sampled hits by rappers than any other artist.

&gt; Roy Ayers was born in Los Angeles. Thanks to his trombone playing father and piano teaching mother, he became immersed in music from day one and the story goes that he was given his first set of vibe mallets by his hero Lionel Hampton at the age of 5. Constantly performing and recording since the 1960s, he is one of the most famous jazz vibraphonists. He has produced some of the most loved modern soul-jazz records of all time such as, ""Everybody Loves The Sunshine"", most influential afro-jazz with musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti (Africa - Centre Of The World) and the most seminal jazz-funk, such as ""Running Away"". And that's just the surface. 2004 saw the release of ""Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased Recordings 1976-1981"" which were 'lost' sessions tapes that he had discarded. Gilles Peterson described this as the equivalent of finding a lost Beatles album. No doubt this helped him win the Gilles Peterson 2004 Worldwide Lifetime Achievement Award. Roy Ayers is ageless and evergreen and as per the title of another one of hits, remember ""We All Live In Brooklyn Baby"".

&gt; Timeline
Ayers started recording as a bebop sideman in 1962 and rose to prominence when he dropped out of City College and joined jazz flutist Herbie Mann in 1966.

&gt; In the early 70's, Roy Ayers started his own band called Roy Ayers Ubiquity, a name he chose because ubiquity means a state of being everywhere at the same time.

&gt; Ayers was responsible for the highly regarded soundtrack to Jack Hill's 1973 blaxploitation film Coffy, which starred Pam Grier. He later moved from a jazz-funk sound to R&amp;B, as seen on Mystic Voyage, which featured the songs ""Evolution"" and the underground disco hit ""Brother Green (The Disco King)"", as well as the title track from his 1976 album Everybody Loves the Sunshine.

&gt; In 1977, Ayers produced an album by the group RAMP, Come into Knowledge, commonly and mistakenly thought to stand for ""Roy Ayers Music Project"". That fall, he had his biggest hit with ""Running Away"".

&gt; In late 1979, Ayers scored his only top ten single on Billboard's Hot Disco/Dance chart with ""Don't Stop The Feeling,"" which was also the leadoff single from his 1980 album ""No Stranger to Love"", whose title track was sampled in Jill Scott's 2001 song ""Watching Me"" from her debut album Who Is Jill Scott?

&gt; In the late 70's, Ayers toured in Nigeria for six weeks with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, one of the Africa's most recognizable musicians. In 1980, Phonodisk released Music of Many Colors in Nigeria, featuring one side lead by Ayers' group and the other lead by Africa '70.

&gt; In 1981, Ayers produced an album with the singer Sylvia Striplin, Give Me Your Love (Uno Melodic Records, 1981). He has also worked in collaborations with soul songstress Erykah Badu.

&gt; Ayers performed a solo on John ""Jellybean"" Benitez's production of Whitney Houston's ""Love Will Save The Day"" from her second multi-platinum studio album Whitney. The single was released in July 1988 by Arista Records.

&gt; Ayers has played his live act for millions of people across the globe, including Japan, Australia, England and other parts of Europe.

&gt; Ayers is known for helping to popularize feel good music in the 70's, stating that ""I like that happy feeling all of the time, so that ingredient is still there. I try to generate that because it's the natural way I am"". The types of music that he used to do this consisted of funk, salsa, jazz, rock, soul and rap.

&gt; 1990s to present
In 1992, Ayers released two albums, Drive and Wake Up, for the hip-hop label Ichiban Records.

&gt; In 1992, Ayers collaborated with Rick James for an album and is quoted to have been a very close friend of his.

&gt; In 1993, Ayers appeared on the record Guru's Jazzmatazz Vol.1 featuring on the vibraphone in the song ""Take a Look (At Yourself)"".

&gt; In 1994, Ayers appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as ""Album of the Year"" by Time Magazine.

&gt; During the 2000s and 2010s, Ayers ventured into house music, collaborating with such stalwarts of the genre as Masters at Work and Kerri Chandler.

&gt; Ayers started two record labels, Uno Melodic and Gold Mink Records. The first released several LPs, including Sylvia Striplin's, while the second folded after a few singles.

&gt; In 2004, Ayers put out a collection of unreleased recordings called Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased recordings 1976‚Äì1981 which allowed fans to hear cuts that didn't make it onto the classic Polydor albums from his more popular years.

&gt; Roy Ayers hosts the fictitious radio station ""Fusion FM"" in Grand Theft Auto IV (2008).

&gt; In 2015, he appeared on Tyler, The Creator's new album Cherry Bomb on the track ""Find Your Wings"".

&gt; A documentary the Roy Ayers Project featuring Ayers and a number hip hop producers who have sampled his music and other people who have been influenced by him and his music has been in development for a number of years.

&gt; Pharrell Williams cites Roy Ayers as one of his key musical heroes.

&gt; Ayers is a recipient of the Congress of Racial Equality Lifetime Achievement Award.

&amp;#x200B;

A maior base dela √© dos progressistas, mas o Bernie Sanders j√° √© um nome bem mais reconhecido e com carisma maior que ela. Mesmo se o Bernie n√£o concorrer, ainda tem outros nomes progressistas com carisma maior que a Warren (apesar de serem menos conhecidos) como a Tulsi Gabbard.

&amp;#x200B;

Pra tentar ganhar as minorias que votaram no Obama nas primarias de 2008 ela vai ter v√°rios problemas, especialmente se algu√©m que faz parte de uma dessas minorias concorrer e isso √© bem prov√°vel. Nomes como Kamala Harris e Cory Booker s√£o constantemente especulados como poss√≠veis candidatos e o Julian Castro deve anunciar a candidatura dele agora em Janeiro. Mesmo se nenhum deles concorrer, ainda tem a possibilidade do Beto concorrer, e se ele conseguir ir bem, ele tem grande chance de ganhar o voto das minorias.

&amp;#x200B;

Finalmente, ela tamb√©m n√£o √© o melhor nome para o establishment democrata, que provavelmente vai querer ficar com algum nome conhecido, como o Joe Biden, ou pegar algum senador relativamente centrista sem sal como os j√° mencionados Cory Booker e Kamala Harris.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Pessoas como Beto O‚ÄôRourke se provaram *muito* potentes com eleitores de classe-m√©dia/alta suburbanos que tradicionalmente votavam republicano, mas que se chocaram com o governo Trump e o caminho que o partido tem tomado. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tem outros dois fatores que acho que ajudaram o Beto. O primeiro foi que o Cruz n√£o √© dos melhores candidatos. Mesmo sendo senador do Texas, um estado muito conservador, ele tem uma taxa de aprova√ß√£o baixa, provavelmente o Trump ajudou essa taxa a ficar baixa com os constantes ataques durante as primarias do partido republicano em 2016.

It got so bad that some of them threatened that, if they ever saw me IRL, they would attack me on the spot or follow me around with the smear campaign. Admittedly I didn't help my own cause because I continued to tell the jokes out of defiance, with the mindset of ""fuck these people, I joke about what I want"". Although I eventually publicly took responsibility for the jokes, apologized, left the place, and never looked back, they were still stalking my blog and sending me flames for a month after I left, so I still don't feel safe. Amazingly, the smear campaign never left that forum (to my knowledge, at least).

Depending on who starts and invites players to the squad we will get majority clans from those servers. 

If we play NA we will mostly get Lost, 1%, CDxx etc. 

If tristen or Ben start the squad (Asian players) we will get blue samurai, and a couple other clans I can‚Äôt translate. 

If Viking or WD40 (Europe) start the squad we get IMP, RU, Vice etc quite a bit.

When I play (I‚Äôm NA) - and we go with Ben or Tristen I noticeable lag, not so much for EU.

I‚Äôll tag Ben or Matt (the only V√òXers I know who have reddit) and they can confirm as well.

Many clans will play other servers to avoid Lost and 1% during NA peak times, and playing against top Asians squad is crazy because they play a super patient mech-out style with lots of splash and midrange.

**Article**:

&gt; In an exclusive interview set to air during Fox News&amp;apos; &amp;apos;All-American New Year&amp;apos; special Monday night,¬†President Trump suggested that only Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren&amp;apos;s ""psychiatrist"" knows whether she thinks she can win the White House in 2020.

&gt; Warren announced¬†Monday she is filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee for president,¬†becoming the first candidate to take the major step toward a 2020 run for the presidency.

&gt; Fox News&amp;apos; Pete Hegseth asked Trump whether Warren really thinks she could make him a one-term president.

&gt; ""Well, that I don&amp;apos;t know,"" Trump¬†responded.¬†""You‚Äôd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

&gt; CATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS&amp;apos; &amp;apos;ALL-AMERICAN NEW YEAR&amp;apos; SPECIAL, 10 PM ET

&gt; Warren, a liberal firebrand who rose to prominence during the 2008¬†financial crisis, angered many¬†top Democrats and Native American groups in October¬†by releasing inconclusive¬†DNA test¬†results in response to Trump&amp;apos;s claims that she repeatedly lied about her heritage to obtain affirmative-action benefits in the course of her academic career.

&gt; The Cherokee Nation responded to the¬†results at the time by asserting that ‚Äúa DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship.‚Äù And¬†Kim TallBear, an associate professor at the University of Alberta, remarked that Warren&amp;apos;s¬†""very desire to locate a claim to Native American identity in a DNA marker inherited from a long-ago ancestor is a settler-colonial racial understanding of what it is to be Native American.""

&gt; ""Elizabeth Warren will be the first,"" Trump told¬†Hegseth in the phone interview.¬†""She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn&amp;apos;t work out too well.""

&gt; According to Warren&amp;apos;s DNA analysis, ""the vast majority‚Äù of Warren‚Äôs family tree is European and there is ‚Äústrong evidence‚Äù she has Native-American ancestry ‚Äúin the range of 6-10 generations ago.‚Äù¬†As reported by the Boston Globe, this means she could be between 1/64 and 1/1,024 Native American.

&gt; ""I think you have more than she does, and maybe I do too, and I have nothing,"" Trump said, referring to tribal heritage. ""So, we‚Äôll see how she does.¬†I wish her well, I hope she does well, I‚Äôd love to run against her.""

&gt; Trump repeatedly has derided Warren for claiming she has Native American ancestry. At¬†a rally in July, he¬†joked that he would¬†pull out a heritage kit during a hypothetical presidential debate¬†with Warren and slowly toss it at her, ""hoping it doesn&amp;apos;t hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces.""

&gt; Separately, Trump again invited top Democrats to join him in Washington to resolve the ongoing partial federal government shutdown -- but he signaled that a border wall is an essential element of any deal.

&gt; The president speaks to Fox News.

&gt; One¬†bipartisan proposal to end the shutdown that has been floated among key senators is to provide¬†$5.7 billion in funding for the border wall, as well as a congressional reauthorization of the Obama-era¬†Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children, along with some other immigration provisions. There also has been talk about a special allowance for some classes of Central American refugees to be granted more robust asylum statuses.

&gt; ""I‚Äôm in Washington, I&amp;apos;m ready, willing and able. I&amp;apos;m in the White House, I&amp;apos;m ready to go,"" Trump said.¬†He added that Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi¬†and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ""can come over right now, they could&amp;apos;ve come over anytime.""

&gt; The president emphasized that he canceled his plans to spend Christmas and New Year&amp;apos;s Day at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida because of the partial shutdown, and signaled that he remains concerned about the approximately 800,000 federal workers who are affected by furloughs and understaffing.

&gt; ""I spent Christmas in the White House, I spent New Year‚Äôs Eve now in the White House,"" Trump said.¬†""And you know, I&amp;apos;m here, I‚Äôm ready to go. It&amp;apos;s very important. A lot of people are looking to get their paycheck, so I&amp;apos;m ready to go whenever they want.""

&gt; He added: ""No, we are not giving up. We have to have border security and the wall is a big part of border security. The biggest part.""

It's because no one knew what was going on there, some people thought they were doing it for no other reason; but the reason was simple: communism. The U.S. didn't want communism spread to other countries - or, hell, even the U.S. of A if people didn't care enough. The Vietnam War took place in the 60s-70s. During this time, stuff like the Hippie Revolution and Hippie music was happening. ""Hippie-ism"" is the idea of no war, and stuff, all leading to world peace. Springsteen wrote a song about it. ""Born in the U.S.A."" It's pretty good. But, in conclusion, the United States did not win the war, and neither did Vietnam. It was a stalemate. And there were horror stories returning to the U.S. too. Stories of Marines having children with prostitutes or citizens, and leaving them to die (like in *Miss Saigon*). World War II vets were treated nice because they knew what was going on in Europe, about the Holocaust, and that it was bad. The same type of communication wasn't happening. To sum it up: a lot of people thought the war was unneeded because no one won, and vets were bullied and beaten because of the stories about bui doi, and also horrible atrocities like My Lai Massacre.

See? Even KC has history, wrong history out count them all. Therefore I don't think it is a good excuse.

Of course I am not asking for 100% historical accuracy in a game. This is just a game. A game is meant to be fun. I agree some restriction is fine. But the restriction they imposed now is just bullshit.

Limit the amount of battleship deploy? Yep I am fine with that. Can only use Fuso and Yamashiro to kill the boss? Sorry. I have no interest in entertaining you Tanaka.

As I said, KC is now just a orgasm of Tanaka, who has no interest in making any improvement but to make the game more and more troublesome.

KC was a gem. But instead of turning it into a jewelry, Tanaka has grounded it down to sand.

Trades46,1536626507.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1wc3jbiy,False,"As someone who grew up in Hong Kong, moved to Canada and then going back to China for family gatherings, it was pretty eye-opening how different the car cultures are in their respective nations.

I have discussed similar things with my uncle there who previously operated used car dealerships &amp; independent garages in Guangdong province about this when I visited him a while back.

&gt;This is important because the Chinese have very different tastes in  automobiles. To simplify it, bigger is better. To get a sense of this, *Buick,* yes Buick, is a trendy brand in China

Generally u/comeonDeckard got the gist of it - in China, car buyers value COMFORT above everything else. The pseudo-sportiness that European brands like BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes brings generally do not sell cars in China. What is considered luxury in China is opposite of what Europeans &amp; Americans are used to - space to stretch out, a serenely quiet interior, technology (this is where Tesla may have a slight edge) and above all, a SOFT pillow-like ride.

This is why almost ALL models sold are locally manufactured (e.g. Brilliance-BMW, Chery-Jaguar, Beijing-Benz) usually have stretched Long wheel base (LWB) variants with extra legroom &amp; deliberately softened suspension &amp; uncharacteristically small (e.g. 16\~17in wheels as opposed to American/European market's 18\~20in) wheels + high-profile tires. Unsurprisingly the ""old men"" brands like Cadillac, Lincoln &amp; especially Buick which are shunned in America actually does quite well in China: when I visited Shanghai a good portion of the cars were the Excelle (think Buick's take on the Cruze), Verano, Regal, LaCrosse &amp; especially the GL8, a Buick luxury minivan.

Yes you heard that right - a Buick minivan. It is quite a popular vehicle there for chauffeurs for VIPs &amp; high ranking businessmen.

&gt;...Tesla sells to this odd little pseudo green niche. Specifically, for  Americans, the model 3 allows for conspicuous consumption while still  being seen as green and seen as cool.

This is a very good point. Americans always heavily associate with what they consume &amp; the image they portray. While this is more prominent in modern China (hence IPhone's popularity) this is not reflected in the ownership of cars. In Shanghai the most popular cars were still economy cars: Corollas/Civics along with cars like Jettas/Boras, Focus, Sylphy, Elantra etc. alongside their Chinese made equivalents (e.g. BYD F3, Roewe 360, Geely Emgrand, Trumpchi GA4 among others) are the cars of choice.

&gt;Another factor is that all luxury cars are really expensive. Both of these factors hollows out  the market in China for ""moderate luxury"" vehicles.

While you'll see a nice Maserati or Porsche occasionally, they are less frequent sightings again due to their price. Anything that is not locally produced (e.g. anything imported: from a 911, G-wagen to even mundane cars like Ford Explorer or Buick Enclave, the only Buick not manufactured in China) are prohibitively expensive.

This from what I understand is mainly from taxes &amp; import fees, which is why almost every automaker has a joint-plant in the nation, and why Tesla themselves are banging loudly about that Shanghai plant.

&gt;Also, there's no corresponding niche for the pseudo-eco validated consumption that exists in America. Instead, a big part of the China market will scoff at the cute and small Model 3.

Small sedans still do well in China (whereas the US sedan sales is just about toast), but even then the C-class, 3 series, XE, ATS etc. are all usually sold in LWB format. The simple fact of the matter is compact executive sedans while popular won't sell AT ALL if they do not possess enough room especially in the rear passenger compartment. This is one glaring problem I immediately noticed when I sat in a Model 3 in Canada: the rear passenger accommodation is atrocious. Ever wondered why the BMW 3 series from the E90 -&gt; F30 -&gt; G20 gotten considerably larger? Now you know why, and that's before considering Brilliance-BMW makes an even longer 320Li for China.

If Tesla actually talked to Chinese customers or gave a f\*\*k about actually selling cars there, the Model 3 without a doubt REQUIRES a LWB to be remotely viable for sales to happen, especially considering LR RWD variant has a  \~500,000RMB starting price which is obscene when you realize the 320Li costs \~350,000RMB and the domestic BYD Qin Pro EV500 (BEV version with \~62 kWh battery at \~310 miles NEDC range) starts at \~219,000RMB.

Another is Tesla's marketing. The Chinese frankly don't care about performance or 0-60 times; majority of cars sold in the nation have under 200hp engines &amp; large SUV rarely exceeding 300hp. I stress again COMFORT is the key to the Chinese market. That immediately brings down one of their biggest selling points in the US market, along with Superchargers being moot (China has already an established charging network + nationalized charging standard) and the American myth of Tesla being a ""pioneer in EV"" dead because the Chinese market is already being flooded with a huge number of choices of a ""New Energy vehicle"" from domestic automakers with numerous more coming down the line for 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I want to add to Deckard's comment in China is how Autopilot is going to be a death-trap in China. While in Canada &amp; US I have experienced unsavory drivers in metropolitan areas such as Toronto, NYC or Downtown LA, they have NOTHING on how the Chinese drive.

Drivers cutting others off is a common practice. Waiting to get out of intersections? Don't expect anyone to yield. On the expressway? Pretty much the same. Trying to rely on AP where it still has close calls in US in China is downright retarded, because frankly there are less painful ways to commit suicide.

While anecdotal, this [Autocar.uk](https://Autocar.uk) participation of ""Best car for China"" where judges pick out the best from the best-selling cars in the country. Notice none of the vehicles tested even are considered remotely ""sporty"" or ""fun to drive"", and the ranking system more heavily prioritizes ""seat comfort"" than ""acceleration"", which is telling how Chinese rates their vehicles. 

Performance simply isn't what Chinese car buyers look for.

Physically, I'm 6ft5 tall, pretty long beard, midback long hair, mostly black leather or denim clothing. Your typical metalhead/rocker dude. Also, I got a lot of obscure hobbies, and I live in a place where you literally have to import EVERYTHING. Also, luggage constraints are annoying. Only 25lbs for the carry-on, but they also allow an item like a purse or small backpack for free? Okay, those 8lbs of lead foil rolls went into the backpack then, along with everything else heavy. In the end that 'small item that has to fit under your seat' did prolly end up weighing around 50lbs, and since they don't weigh your 'personal item' and only your carry-on bag, it went unnoticed. Suspicious items get examined at the security checkpoint, though? Who'd have thought car ignition coils can look like hand grenades, huh? Not to mention there's the word 'ignition' in there, which is enough to make airport security jumpy. Add to that other 'unusual' items such as electronics prototype boards and parts, spools of magnet wire, thermal camera equipment, a good dozen of li-ion battery packs (each one below the maximum allowed size, mind you), several pounds of bismuth metal as well as a few bars of indium, some large graphite electrodes....

Then the whole bags get saran-wrapped. The saran wrap gets reinforced with several broad bands of heavy duty duct tape. And on either side of the bag the destination letters of the airport it's going to get taped in 5"" high letters. Baggage handlers and inspectors are people too, inspecting dozens of bags a day gets tedious and boring, and I bet you that if they can choose between some bag they only gotta unzip and one where they have to work through layers upon layers of packing 'security', they'll check the easy bags first.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/18/just-about-everything-youve-read-warren-dna-test-is-wrong/

&gt; Here‚Äôs where the reporting went off course. The report said that Warren had 10 times more Native American ancestry than the reference set from Utah, and 12 times more than the set from Britain. The report also said that the long segment on Chromosome 10 indicated that the DNA came from a relatively recent ancestor. ...

&gt; The most important point is this: The results in Warren‚Äôs DNA test are static. The percentage of Native American DNA in her genome does not shrink as you go back generations. There could be one individual in the sixth generation ‚Äî living around the mid-1800s, which is similar to Warren family lore ‚Äî or possibly a dozen or more ancestors back to the 10th generation, which would be about 250 years ago. Her results are consistent with a single ancestor, however. ...

&gt; This basic error in understanding the test results was compounded by the RNC‚Äôs reference to the 2014 New York Times article, which was about a genetic profile of the United States, based on a study of 160,000 people drawn from the customer base of 23andMe, a consumer personal genetics company. With reporters believing that Warren‚Äôs genome was only as little as 0.01 percent Native American*, the article‚Äôs line that ‚ÄúEuropean-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 Native American‚Äù made it appear as if Warren‚Äôs sample was even smaller than that of the average American. (*Note: an earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to the high end of range, 1.56 percent.)

And this was said when?

&gt; ...that isn't particularly true, if you are ignoring an entire continent.

Which is something you didn't mention at all, therefore I can hardly be blamed for not inferring it.

&gt; To give a quick list of African works worth checking out would be ""Mhudi"" by Sol Plaatje, or his adaptations of Shakespeare, ""Things fall apart"" by Chinua Achebe, literally anything by Wole Soyinka.

Or I could have mentioned *Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English* by Ken Saro-Wiwa, *In Corner B* by Es'kia Mphahlele, *Petals of Blood* by Ngugi wa Thiong'o, *Ways of Dying* by Zakes Mda, *The Bride Price* by Buchi Emecheta, and of course Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is now well-known. And since North Africa is also Africa (speaking of having blind spots), I could have mentioned The Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz, *The Yacoubian Building* by Alaa al-Aswany, and *Fugitive Light* by Mohammad Berrada.

&gt; or other works by White Africans.

You mean other white Africans like Nadine Gordimer, J. M. Coetzee, Athol Fugard, etc.?

The extensive list we've just compiled between us is the reason why I *didn't* mention these figures, because we've now blown way past my dozen-book limit. I don't want to overwhelm people with recommendations, so there has to be a stopping point somewhere. I chose a dozen, a good round number, and therefore I wasn't able to mention many works, several of which I considered before selecting something else.

&gt; Furthermore, whilst poorly worded by me, the other problem with your post is that you explicitly place African Diaspora as an exclusively ""American"" thing, see the distinction between South American and just ""American"".

I can't be responsible for your faulty inferences. The reason I said ""of the African diaspora"" is because Nella Larsen was and Percival Everett is African-American. That does not apply to Clarice Lispector (who was of Ukrainian descent) or Machado de Assis.

&gt; Like why not mention Haitians? Why not Jamaicans? or Black Brazilians? or Black Latinos in general?

For the obvious reason that none of them were authors of the books I was mentioning.

&gt; I mean the Asians you mention arent even that radical or different, an Indian and a Japanese person.

What a surprise: when choosing classic works to feature, I happen to select from a couple of countries with literary traditions going back for millennia. Do you evaluate the worth of books according to themselves, or by the country of origin of the authors?

&gt; In this regard your list isnt really a list of writers writing in a context outside of Europe and the US.

The reason why Canada and Norway are doing okay is because they were liberal democracies before oil became a thing.

I'm not looking for a realistic recreation of the US involvement in the Middle East after 9/11. I'm looking for more Ghost Recon. Maybe if it loosely took inspiration from that event, such as an attack on US soil that sparked a huge war. They could return to form and tie in a Splinter Cell game with the events of a new Ghost Recon and release a new update for R6:Siege that would further reflect the impact of the event. Perhaps even use the plot of The Division 2 to support the terrorist attack (if the plot is half decent). 

With that said, it'd be cool to see the **location set in two countries in Europe** as a new war has been waged there and instead of a rebel faction, it could be an allied or US army faction. This could further compliment the context of being called a Ghost as your team would operate away from the US army's direct involvement in the war, but still assist them under elite and covert operations behind enemy lines. As the game progresses, more US troops could be seen in new regions of the map as they begin to push the frontline backwards.

Furthermore, this would play well into the Ghost Recon lore as it could take place after the events of Future Soldier and involve the Russian Ultra nationalists as the antagonists. 

 Europe has a lot to offer in terms of environments and all the set pieces are already there from Future Soldier to include more challenging foes on the same level as the Ghosts.

WaturTribe,1525858966.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_xbgl4j4,False,"Now **this** is a wall of text. I will reply out of courtesy and also because I have been where you are right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I called it ""some religion"", is not to shy away from responsibility or something by obfuscating it. With my words, I meant to downplay its importance. I know that Christianity has had a profound impact on the lives of people in Western society and that partly through Christianity we managed to get so far ahead. I agree with you on the fact that today's Protestantism is far better than certain other religions, for the reasons you already wrote in your comment.

&amp;#x200B;

However, here is where I don't agree with you:

&gt;The religion of White Western countries was historically Protestantism: belief in Christ as the saviour; based on faith alone and without the sanctity of the Roman Catholic Church which is believed to be ""tainted""

&amp;#x200B;

This is only true for the period after the inception of Protestantism. **Before** that time Europe was largely still Catholic and rife with superstition. And how far back do you want to go? Before Christianity itself, the tribes in what is now called Europe had their own beliefs. So did the Greeks and the Romans. Before Christianity, the developed world already existed. Yet you seem to say in the rest of your comment that we ought to be content with (in my words: the most respectable version of) Christianity.

My friend, the reason we can converse, ask questions and talk freely is not solely because of Christianity. The renaissance and enlightenment periods have allowed us to shed the shackles of superstition. And be aware that not just the West has known periods of such developments.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, there was the Islamic Golden Age, when something other than war **did** happen in North Africa and the Middle East. You seem to ignore this in your comment. There are times, in any culture, when superstition is put on the back burner and critical thinking is allowed. That we live in places where this holds true today is something we should be very grateful for.

&amp;#x200B;

The crux of my comment is this: Why settle at Protestantism as the least corrupt and most benign religion? Why not take it a step further? Why not cut out all superstitious beliefs? Is that not the whole idea of this very subreddit? *Going your own way*. Now I don't mean that you should wallow in nihilism, as you cut out religion from your life. There are still many principles that can guide you. You may have very well chosen Protestantism as your guide and that's fine by me. Part of adhering to a narrative is that you should be expectant of critique every now and then. Such is life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whether you believe in ""religion"" (belief in the supernatural) or not, the mark of the beast will come soon enough: you'll be microchipped to buy and sell shit, and eventually just to live.

I have been a fanatical conspiracy theorist yearning for Jesus to come and save me at the end times. I could write you off as one and be done with it, but I believe that people can change. Only because of the patience and love of the people around me I am able to write these words in a calm and precise manner. I am able to think more critically than I ever did in my Christian days.

Yes, the ""mark of the beast"" is written about in old texts, but that does not mean it has to be true in any way. You only see a sliver of reality. You observe merely a part of the full picture and your fantasy filled brain fills in the rest. You think you have ""connected the dots"" and, truly, to the best of your internal measures you believe you are right. Please read the story of Percival Lowell, who, in his age came to the conclusion that the planet Mars had to have been inhabited by creatures who dug canals.

&amp;#x200B;

If you wish to talk further you can always send me a message. Cheers.

Maybe I'm not being clear. Yes, I beleive that companies should be owned by the employees rather than by a single person. This is even more important now as automation reduces the need for employees, thus broadening the steam of money to the company's profit line. I also beleive that all land should belong to the state. Profit made from working the land goes to the people working the land, but they cannot sell land or profit from unused land.

Neodimium60,1537218109.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_28dwc1nj,False,"Olha, todos os livros que eu li esse ano eu achei excelentes, mas acho que o melhor vai pro Silmarillion, principalmente o trecho da can√ß√£o dos Ainur. Li o Hobbit pela primeira vez e depois reli os outros tr√™s livros de O Senhor dos An√©is, assim como As Aventuras de Tom Bombadil e Outras Hist√≥rias. Tamb√©m li a tradu√ß√£o do Tolkien dos contos de Sigurd e Beowulf. Li a saga dos Volsungs ( vi muitas similaridades com os temas que aparecem nas obras do Tolkien). O segundo melhor livro que li nesse ano foi A Tale of Two Cities, de Charles Dickens, da √∫ltima vez que pesquisei sobre ele ainda n√£o tinha tradu√ß√£o mas deve sair em breve. Men√ß√£o honrosa para The Face of Another, do Kobo Abe.

&amp;#x200B;

Outros √≥timos livros foram:

* Contos Completos de Oscar Wilde: tinha lido na inf√¢ncia e foi excelente revisitar hist√≥rias t√£o tocantes, principalmente a do Pr√≠ncipe Feliz e a do Gigante Bondoso, que eu recomendo bastante;
* Negras Ra√≠zes do Haley foi uma √≥tima leitura (em ingl√™s, a tradu√ß√£o em portugu√™s deixou muito a desejar), mas eu descobri que uma parte da trama foi baseada em um livro chamado The African, de Harold Courlander, que eu planejo ler agora em 2019.

Peguei um conjunto de pe√ßas do Arist√≥fanes para ler tamb√©m:

* As Nuvens;
* S√≥ para mulheres;
* um Deus chamado dinheiro;
* Lis√≠strata.

Os mais longos foram livros de hist√≥ria:

* Os Romanov 1613-1918, do Simon Sebag Montefiore, uma obra s√≥lida sobre a ascens√£o e queda da fam√≠lia imperial russa, com poucos pontos baixos;
* As obras completas de Di√£o C√°ssio, edi√ß√£o Delphi Classics, o mais trabalhoso mas bastante recompensador ler a descri√ß√£o feita por romanos de eventos como as guerras civis que levaram √† instala√ß√£o de c√©sar, a revolta dos Iceni (liderada por Boudicca), o governo de Commodus entre outras.

Tem alguns quadrinhos que eu posso recomendar tamb√©m:

* Os dois volumes de Maus: j√° havia lido o primeiro volume em 2017 mas descobri que havia outro volume e corri para reler o primeiro e ent√£o pegar o segundo;
* O Perfuraneve, edi√ß√£o Aleph, que cont√©m os tr√™s volumes: O Perfuraneve, os Exploradores e A Travessia, que contam a hist√≥ria de um mundo congelado em que a √∫nica forma de sobreviv√™ncia √© em um trem .

No problem.

&gt; This is mirrored in the Labour Party too. A no-deal Brexit could cause a rupture in The Labour Party just as it will in The Tory Party

There's a divide, but it's pretty much strictly over leaving the EU itself, rather than over the policies that people want to see in a post-EU UK. The main opposition to leaving the EU is from the Blairite faction, who are basically trying to use it to drive a wedge into Corbyn's support, rather than due to any kind of principled position. There were large chunks of the 2017 manifesto (which is credited for Labour's current popularity) which are incompatible with EU rules, so while many of our voters disagree with leaving the EU, we're much more united in what we want to happen afterwards.

# The things that make fax *unreliable*:

* some idiot in the office dumped the faxes and took out the garbage before reading them. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/a4kzcu/nhs_told_to_ditch_absurd_fax_machines_the_nhs/ebgqn93/), cc: u/Deceptiveideas u/supermunchkin001)

# The things that make e-mail *unreliable*:

* the recipient's client tools decide incorrectly that the message is spam and stores the message where it will never be seen
* the receiving mail server uses a DNSBL to...
   * ..block connections from the sender
   * ..accept and blackhole messages from the sender
   * ..accept and deliver messages to a place that is never visited
* the recipient's mail service decides for any flawed reason that the message is spam and delivers it to a folder that will never be seen
* the recipient uses a `spamgourmet.com` address and forgot to update the counter thus causing the message to be blackholed or the service provider of the protected address blocks the spamgourmet.com server specifically
* recipient's mail server may reject the message if the domain name appearing in the `From:` field does not correspond with the IP address of the transmitting server (e.g. MUA allows freetyping the `From:` field and sender uses a `spamgourmet.com` address)
* the recipient uses a forwarding service like Namesilo, who refuses to forward messages from unrecognized senders because the forwarding service considers their own IP reputation more important than the actual delivery of a single message
* the recipient's mail server uses graylisting with unreasonable delay.  Time-sensitive messages can miss the deadline or sending servers can give up before the time lapse.
* recipient's e-mail server blocks the attachment (and possibly the whole email) incorrectly flagging it as malware.
* recipient's e-mail address is unknown because a webmaster's anti-spam effort...
   * ..is to not publish any email addresses.  Senders are forced to use a contact form that's blocked by a sometimes broken CAPTCHA.  And when the webform does work, PDF attachments are not possible.
   * ..is to block e-mail address disclosure until a CAPTCHA is solved, and the CAPTCHA is broken or the sender rejects the effort required
   * ..entails hiding e-mail addresses until some javascript renders them, but javascript is either unsupported or disabled by the visitor's secure browser.  There is also no indication to the visitor that an e-mail address is even available if j/s were to execute.
* recipient's e-mail address is unknown because the webpage publishing it blocks Tor and the visitor will be damned if they must give up their security to view the page
* the sender simply cannot send the message because the corporation who handles the recipient's email (e.g. is a PRISM corp like Google or Microsoft) is not sufficiently trustworthy for the content of the message
* large corporations use DNSBLs to force email senders to relay their mail through a static IP, and the sender with dynamic IP may not consider any third party sufficiently trustworthy to see *all* their emails
* sender boycotts the recipients e-mail provider
* recipient does not have an S/MIME cert. or PGP public key, thus failing to achieve the level of confidentiality required by the sender (some sys admins even refuse to accommodate encrypted e-mail in fear that a malicious payload will get past the organizations malware scanner)
* recipient uses an EU-based e-mail service provider, where law obligates collection of metadata (a collection that may jeopardize the level of confidentiality required by the sender), and the recipient or sender are not using a [Memory Hole](https://github.com/autocrypt/memoryhole)-capable MUA to protect their metadata
* recipient abandons their mailbox because they have other accounts and can't be bothered to manage all of them, and unread mail piles up
* sender is a technologically-challenged bank or brokerage who sends multipart MIME messages and puts in the plaintext part:
   * a message saying ""Upgrade your mail client"" instead of the actual message
   * a large dump of unreadable machine-generated HTML indistinguishable from garbage
* sender attaches a file in a non-standard proprietary format like MS Word and the recipient cannot view it (or does not trust it to open it for viewing).",True,False,False,,0,1546349867,,1546357269,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0f8wt,False,t3_a4kzcu,True,t1_ebgqn93,/r/technology/comments/a4kzcu/nhs_told_to_ditch_absurd_fax_machines_the_nhs/ed0f8wt/,,1550731446,3,True,False,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,

 Ciro Gomes, em entrevista em seu apartamento em Fortaleza - Jarbas Oliveira - 30.out.18 Para quem, como eu, tem o cora√ß√£o ligado na vida do povo, √© inevit√°vel a percep√ß√£o de que as esperan√ßas da maioria dos brasileiros se renovaram, em larga escala pelo encontro sazonal do in√≠cio de um novo ano com a posse de um novo governo. Essas energias, ainda que algo supersticiosas ou meramente psicol√≥gicas, n√£o s√£o est√©reis. Podem ajudar muito a construir coisas pr√°ticas na dire√ß√£o da sofrida agenda nacional.

 N√£o seria eu a botar areia nesse sentimento. Tor√ßo genuinamente que as coisas possam melhorar e at√© acho que melhorar√£o, ainda que modestamente.

 √â que pouco importam as fic√ß√µes de contagem do tempo t√£o necess√°rias √† nossa psicologia humana: o problema de partida em nosso pa√≠s √© objetivamente muito dif√≠cil e grave. A pol√≠tica pode produzir rupturas, reorienta√ß√µes, e rumos novos. Mas n√£o por si ou por qualquer fatalismo como o que deriva da mera troca de governo.

 √â preciso diagn√≥stico correto, terap√™utica bem administrada, equipe, disciplina, bons ventos exteriores, bom equil√≠brio entre autoridade e habilidade pol√≠ticas, senso de urg√™ncia e ...compromisso! Uma pitada de sorte √© sempre bem-vinda.

 Nessa conjun√ß√£o reside minha descren√ßa objetiva em grandes mudan√ßas. Alguns n√∫meros: quase [13 milh√µes de pessoas desempregadas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/12/desemprego-em-novembro-cai-a-116-informa-ibge.shtml); 17 milh√µes de pessoas vivendo de bico na informalidade; 63 milh√µes de pessoas com nome sujo no SPC; endividamento empresarial recorde; d√©ficit p√∫blico de R$ 130 bilh√µes, d√≠vida p√∫blica superior R$ 5,2 trilh√µes, um quarto disso vencendo em poucos dias; 63,8 mil homic√≠dios nos √∫ltimos 12 meses; 60 mil estupros no mesmo per√≠odo; dengue, chikungunya, mal√°ria e sarampo epid√™micos e um grave problema de aten√ß√£o b√°sica de sa√∫de, agravado pela [sa√≠da dos m√©dicos estrangeiros](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/11/com-eleicao-de-bolsonaro-cuba-anuncia-fim-da-parceria-com-brasil-no-mais-medicos.shtml).

 Em resumo, esses s√£o alguns dos n√∫meros que desenham provavelmente a mais aguda crise socioecon√¥mica da hist√≥ria moderna do Brasil. Para qualquer um, a revers√£o desse quadro n√£o seria f√°cil. Para quem permitiu a percep√ß√£o simplificada ao extremo dos problemas e se deixou ver como capaz de resolver tudo a golpes de frases feitas ou de uma radicalizada ret√≥rica que mistura moralismo com ideologia estreita...Eis as raz√µes de meus temores.

 Realisticamente, para algu√©m com minha experi√™ncia, talvez a palavra correta em rela√ß√£o ao cen√°rio de 2019 seja uma grande interroga√ß√£o! Ningu√©m sabe, a meros momentos do in√≠cio efetivo do novo governo, o que vai ser. Nenhuma proposta concreta, nenhum di√°logo sistem√°tico com a intrincada federa√ß√£o politica do pa√≠s, e [os primeiros esc√¢ndalos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/fabricio-queiroz-diz-que-movimentacao-atipica-vem-de-comercio-de-carros.shtml) j√° t√™m o velho tratamento de antanho: ""Fiz, mas eles (PT) fizeram tamb√©m"". Familiares apontando potencial escandaloso tamb√©m √© hist√≥ria velha. Assim como a relativiza√ß√£o de valores com que se olham a si e aos advers√°rios.

 A equipe √©, para dizer o m√≠nimo, inexperiente. O mais importante assessor n√£o tem nem um dia sequer de viv√™ncia no setor p√∫blico. Outros... bem, h√° os que fraudam mapas para privilegiar interesses econ√¥micos e aqueles que j√° se apresentam com pr√°ticas question√°veis. O diagn√≥stico, travado por um liberalismo tosco, √©, para dizer pouco, equivocado.

 Depois de afundarmos na terap√™utica Dilma/Temer, alguma revers√£o √© de se esperar. Que venha, pois nosso povo precisa e merece. Mas o potencial de confus√£o, por essa mistura de graves problemas, grave incompet√™ncia e despreparo, equipe fraca e desconhecimento do pa√≠s me permite apostar mais na sorte...Que ela ajude nosso Brasil!

 Uma palavra sobre a oposi√ß√£o, neste quadro. √â preciso evitar o oportunismo rasteiro e demag√≥gico; atrair o governo para o jogo democr√°tico, for√ß√°-lo a atuar dentro da institucionalidade, oferecer alternativas pr√°ticas ao equ√≠vocos sem negar a complexidade dos problemas, muito menos explorar as muitas contradi√ß√µes derivadas da ret√≥rica tosca. A cada bobagem, uma proposta! E fiscalizar sem tr√©guas.

From your hostility and rudeness you obviously want an argument but I will try to keep this civil at least from my end.

First off Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson do not have influence disproportionate to their positions, they are both MPs and the reason they both have more influence than someone like Sajit Javid is because they have open opinions that resonate with lots of members of the public.

The reason I didn‚Äôt reference it was because I, again, was making a passing comment and could not be ‚Äúarsed‚Äù at the time to find the link.

Also as far as I know, 4 year led don‚Äôt twist the meaning of words, that seems a bit too complex for a 4 year old to do.

Everything not defined in these directives is left to the local authorities.

toastymow,1319777265.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_64s1v,False,"&gt; Why are they still allowed to operate? The churches should be shut down, 

Let me put it in simple terms: The Catholic Church is the world's biggest mafia. And I say that as a god-fearing Christian who went to a Catholic University and likes a lot of Catholic Theology. 

The Catholic Church is old, really old. They are one of the oldest institutions in existence. They are older than pretty much all the governments in Europe, certainly the governments in places like Australia. The Catholic Church is a COUNTRY. Its not just a Church. Vatican City has the ability to issue its own passports. They have embassies! Bureaucrats! Technically, they have a standing army, though the Swiss Guard are pretty much just a formality these days. Technically, the Swiss Guard do have guns though. The Catholic Church is fucking loaded too. They have all kinds of money. They (mostly) use it to do what they consider charity, and to be honest, its mostly good work. But the point is that they are fucking rich, and that alone gives them the kind of power that few institutions can rival. 

So members of the Catholic Church, and I'll be honest this probably goes all the way up to the fucking Pope (maybe not this Pope, but certainly a Pope in the last 60-70 years), have been involved in either the raping of children, boys or girls it really doesn't matter, or covering up the raping of a child by another priest. They have done this world-wide. Its a consistent pattern. They are serial enablers of serial abusers. They're an institution that, as part of its nature, harbors criminals and pedophiles. 

You look at ANY OTHER INSTITUTION and you say ""break it up. Jail the leaders, make an example of them."" You look at what we do to OTHER organizations that harbor pedophiles and enable the raping and sexual exploitation of CHILDREN and you know this is true. Because those organizations are usually called gangs, or human traffickers, or something awful like that. 

So really, there isn't a good solution. The typical method of going after such a large-scale organization in the United States is a RICO case. That's what they did to FIFA recently. But an attempt to RICO the Catholic Church is... it would be historic. It would be unheard of. And I have a feeling it would get peopled killed.

&gt; The intermediary‚Äôs role is that of a facilitator whose contacts, knowledge or even language skills might benefit sporting directors in this country or agents based overseas

&gt; I would typically spend the leadup to December putting out feelers to clubs or scouts, usually face-to-face at games, before supplying sporting directors with lists of options to pursue in the window. Simultaneously, I will have cultivated relationships with agents abroad to ascertain what their clients offer, securing written mandates to represent their players in negotiations in England or even with specific teams.

There's also a good breakdown of contract negotiations:

&gt; Take a scenario: it is 10am on transfer deadline day and a club, to whom I have already sent videos of a mandated player based abroad, belatedly decide they want to push through a deal before the 11pm cut-off. They will be aware of the player‚Äôs asking price so, as the intermediary, you have to assume that aspect of the move will not prove problematic. It is now a matter of securing the best contract possible in what time remains. So, having spoken at length with the player‚Äôs existing agent, I would fire off an email to the club ‚Äì it is essential it is in written form ‚Äì laying down the basic pay and, just as significantly, the bonus structure acceptable to the player.

&gt; Those bonuses can be incredibly intricate, and quite volatile. There are standard team clauses: the amount owed for winning the league, gaining promotion or avoiding relegation; for lifting the Champions League or qualifying for Europe. Then there is the potentially prickly issue of image rights, as well as personal incentives ‚Äì top scorer, goal or appearance bonuses ‚Äì and sums due for playing a certain number of games. Within that you might specify what constitutes an appearance: 45 minutes, an hour or even coming off the bench for a minute of stoppage time. If you are doing a deal for a club going for promotion you could seek a guarantee to raise the player‚Äôs salary in the new division. Likewise, you might accept a salary drop, or insert a release clause, in the event of relegation.

&gt; The demands are then emailed to the club, who could make amendments of their own. Once the deal is agreed in principle, you await the formal contract offer, usually drawn up by the club‚Äôs in-house solicitors and emailed over . That, too, has to be legalled at our end and there may be more to-ing and fro-ing over the finer details before, once the green light is given by both sides, you address the logistics of bringing the player over.",True,False,False,,0,1546354562,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0iihr,True,t3_abipcd,False,t3_abipcd,/r/soccer/comments/abipcd/a_football_agent_gives_an_insiders_account_on_the/ed0iihr/,,1550732953,12,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,

But hey, since you mention it... a white nation for the white race would be fantastic. Just like the Jews have a Jewish nation in Israel. The Native Americans have their own dependent sovereign tribal nations. Like essentially all other nations have a strong and rational interest in the preservation of their cultural, ethnic, and racial groups.

Only whites are forbidden from having this, with a concerted effort being made from the government level on down today to break up and dissolve any and all strong white majority areas. Countries, cities, communities, etc.

Flip that around and talk about whites mass migrating into another country, demanding the news be broadcast in English, that the voting system be offered in English and them allowed to vote, etc etc... and you'd hear screams of colonialism and cultural imperialism etc.

But talk about any other racial or ethnic group doing that exact same thing into ""white"" countries? You're told whites have no such thing, no right to it, and should REJOICE at being slowly replaced, made into a minority (despite us being told how terrible being a minority is for non-whites), and how we should put their interests, language, culture, values etc above our own etc.

It's absolutely ridiculous when you actually stop and honestly think about it, and take any of these situations and simply swap the race of the groups involved.

It's also why you see so much hatred for the few countries in Europe that have pushed back against the migrant invasion. Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, etc. Despite them enjoying their safety and peaceful societies while the rest of western Europe faces increased terrorism, social unrest, the looming collapse of their welfare states... their statements about how they must accept the ""new normal"" of constant unrest and threat of terrorist attacks etc.

We tore up the ABM treaty with Russia to put ABM systems in Europe and undermine their strategic deterrence.

1. Why do you want to study psychology?

2. Don‚Äôt choose a degree, a career, for the sake of someone else. Do it for you. If what you want is also what they want, great. If not, then that‚Äôs unfortunate, but you‚Äôre the one who has to get the degree and then go to work every day. 

3. Some things you can do postgraduate study in without needing undergrad. You can become a doctor with an MD, with any kind of undergrad degree. Some medical programs have prerequisite subjects, but looking at the big picture - medicine is something where you can get an unrelated degree first. 

4. What subjects are you good at in school? If you‚Äôre good at everything, don‚Äôt say that. Instead, think about what subjects you enjoy most, and what subjects are your best subjects. They may or may not be the same. What are they? 

5. In a psychology degree you will cover a bit of neuroscience (neuropsychology/anatomy/pharmacology/physiology etc.). 

6. A lot of the subjects you take in undergrad psychology mix science-art-philosophy. So you‚Äôll constantly be thinking about things in different ways and discussing ideas and linking concepts.

It's because of our national myth that everyone can be successful if they work hard and make the right choices.  Recently, it's become more difficult to be successful without a college degree, and our national myth has metastasized into ""everyone can get a college degree if they really want it.""  For example, my sister who teaches high school has told me that one of the explicit goals of her institution is to have every student go to college.

So I have students who are the first in their families to go to college, who have to work full-time to afford college, who are not academically prepared, and struggling with issues they have no control over.  A lot of my students don't know what the expectations are, and if I teach them with the approach you've outlined many more will fail.  And that's fine in Europe, where there are clearly delineated alternative careers, and no one goes bankrupt from paying medical bills.  But the U.S. economy is a Mordorian wasteland, and I'm trying to save everyone who can be saved.  So I do lots of hand-holding.  I email students if they don't show up to class for a few days in a row, I drop the lowest exam in 100-level courses, and I have rubrics for everything explicitly stating how points will be calculated.

&gt; Biography

&gt; 
Hayvanlar Alemi is a psychedelic folk rock band founded in Ankara. They got together in secondary school in 1999, when they were 14. Classical rock and heavy metal were big influences on teenagers in Ankara then, and they started their musical venture playing hard-and-heavy covers, but very soon self-discovered free improvisation and moved into a more avant-garde approach, and later on occasionally deployed traditional instruments, found-sound elements like live radio, and colorful stage theatrics. They were influenced by the new folk-infused experimental rock scene of the late 90s Istanbul, but isolated from any music scene in Ankara, their sound and song-structure diverged from their contemporaries as they incorporated elements from the findings of their musical research into their sound, which included folk, pop and hybrid sounds of South East Asia, East and West Africa, South America and Russia, as well as Jamaican dub reggae and Californian surf.

&gt; Having begun self-releasing cdrs in 2004, Hayvanlar Alemi released their first album ‚ÄúGaga‚Äù through Ankara label 003 Records in 2006. Their second album ‚ÄúGuarana Superpower‚Äù, mostly culled from tracks on their cdrs from 2007 to 2009, was released by Seattle label Sublime Frequencies in 2010, followed by a cover of Mulatu Astatke‚Äôs Ethiopian instrumental piece ‚ÄúYekermo Sew‚Äù on seven inch vinyl. Following the release of Guarana Superpower which received positive reviews from publications such as The Guardian, Uncut and Wire, Hayvanlar Alemi opened for Group Doueh in London‚Äôs Barbican Centre and played a surprise performance at All Tomorrow‚Äôs Parties Festival Curated by Animal Collective. Since then they have been touring routinely and presenting their music to live audiences in Western Europe.  The band's third official album ""Twisted Souvenirs"", which was recorded in 2011 and 2012,  come out on vinyl on German label Unrock on 2014  and in early 2015 as a digital download on Inverted Spectrum Records, a Bandcamp label managed by the band's drummer.

&gt; Hayvanlar Alemi consists of √ñz√ºm ƒ∞tez, I≈üƒ±k Sarƒ±han, Hazar Mutgan and G√∂k√ße Ba≈üar. As they have been separated by geographical boundaries since 2006, the band has a flexible repertoire which allows them to play in power-duo and power-trio formations as well. In the past few years, Hayvanlar Alemi mostly toured with an old-school three piece set up with drums (Sarƒ±han), bass (Mutgan) and electric guitar (ƒ∞tez), with an emphasis on heavy psychedelic rock.  Band's name translates to English as ""Animal Kingdom"". Outside music,  band members  work in the fields of architecture, engineering, physics and philosophy.

You captured Scarlet's essence well although I was hoping for one mad screenshot of her [""laughing her leaves off""](https://youtu.be/LklhISETDJU?t=27) just to sell home Scarlet's creative insanity (not that we could ever forget her mentioning Faren's ""fancy panties"" and taking a liking to him when we rescued poor scantily clad Faren from Scarlet's cauldron in DR). In fact, those caps reminded me of this fun [player idea for a screenshot](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/147863/gw046.jpg) from the old GW2 forums depicting Scarlet and Trahearne chatting (as much as I oppose what Scarlet says there, the idea itself still makes me smile imagining what the actual interactions between Firstborn brother and Secondborn sister might've been like). ;)

I always found [Scarlet's history with the Inquest among other factions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Short_Story:_What_Scarlet_Saw) fascinating, and her being one of the influences goading the Inquest to cause the infamous Thaumanova reactor disaster was a nice tie-in to explain those mysterious occurrences back in the day as it advanced Scarlet's research on dragon energy, chaos magic and ley lines and gave us clues what she would ultimately be after.

It would be interesting if we ran into Scarlet's ghost in the Mists one day to give Taimi's arc some closure (given how big a Scarlet fangirl she was when introduced in Season 1, and how Taimi'd react to meeting her former ""idol"") and show Scarlet as the sociopath she awakened as but this time without Mordremoth influencing her actions and her maybe willing to use her brainpower to help us with our current Mists predicament to save Tyria (she may be a mad genius, but she wouldn't want her grand experiment to see Tyria evolve end with the destruction of all reality). Even better if we also met the ghost of Scarlet's mentor Omadd and saw some reconciliation between them, with Scarlet maybe apologizing for killing him while under Mordy's influence. After all, she seemed to regret her actions in S1 if using Omadd's name as a password for her encrypted files, having a torn portrait of Omadd in her lair, and her reacting angrily to Kasmeer calling her Ceara (as Omadd had done before Ceara had returned from the machine adopting the persona of Scarlet) during the final battle were any indication. :)",True,False,False,,0,1546363345,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed0rdz0,False,t3_abex6r,True,t3_abex6r,/r/Guildwars2/comments/abex6r/local_sylvari_joins_the_inquest_and_disappoints/ed0rdz0/,,1550737104,1,True,False,Guildwars2,t5_2r9po,r/Guildwars2,public,
rieslingatkos,1457137143.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_w58ip,False,"&gt; *Nuclear power guarantees unlimited range, with a submarine‚Äôs only limiting factors being food and crew morale. The ability to speed across the Pacific or Atlantic directly into action, without needing to stop and refuel, is a powerful capability.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *There are other advantages. Nuclear submarines can be considerably larger than diesel electric boats and thus fitted with more non-attack capabilities (unmanned undersea vehicles, spy gear, or room for combat divers and SEALs). That's because no matter how big the sub gets, it doesn't have to take on proportionately large amounts of voluminous liquid fuel. Nuclear submarines also can stay submerged for very long periods of time, although the new generation of diesel electric submarines can stay submerged longer than ever before.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *One of the problems with non-nuclear subs is the need to rely on bases. Although few people talk about it, the fact is that in the event of a real war with China, every major military base from Okinawa to Guam will be bombarded with conventionally-armed ballistic missiles. Their goal: to destroy the springboards of American power into China‚Äôs backyard, pushing the Americans all the way back to Hawaii. Some missiles would get shot down, but others will get through. (This isn‚Äôt just limited to a war with China. You could overlay the same scenario over Europe with a hypothetical conflict with Russia.)*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Thus, in the event of war with China, it is quite likely that non-nuclear American submarines would lose their forward bases‚Äîwhich was the point of building them in the first place. The nearest places they could rearm and refuel would probably be Australia and Hawaii. A diesel boat with a burning Yokosuka naval base in its periscope and a quarter tank of diesel fuel is going to be in a lot of trouble. A nuclear-powered boat is not. In the event of a surprise attack by a major adversary, America‚Äôs forward-deployed nuclear-powered submarine fleet may be the only ships that survive the first day of war.*

I take very much issue with that. ""Stalin's"" theory of uneven development was just as much known to Trotsky as it was to Lenin. Stalin distorted this law by his attempt to justify something with it can't be justified with it: the reactionary theory of socialism in one country. 

Trotsky on the other hand was not only well-acquainted with the law of ""uneven"" development but also with another law derived from it: the law of combined development. His theory of permanent revolution is based on this understanding of ""uneven and combined development"". As yet another Chinese Trotskyist explained:

&gt; ""Trotsky‚Äôs theory of permanent revolution is inseparable from his ‚Äòlaw of combined development‚Äô. Lenin discovered the ‚Äòlaw of uneven development‚Äô and used it to explain a great many things. Trotsky invented his ‚Äòlaw of combined development‚Äô on the foundations of Lenin‚Äôs discovery, and used it to explain even more things. Trotsky‚Äôs law showed that a large number of so-called ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô periods in history are not simply ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô but constitute social systems in their own right. Past and future forms of development ‚Äòcombine‚Äô their special characteristics and so develop into a system. For example, the system of ‚Äòautocratism‚Äô in modern European history produced by the ‚Äòcombination‚Äô of certain special features of capitalism with others of feudalism can endure for a comparatively long time and sustain its own special politics, culture, and thought. ‚ÄòTsarism‚Äô, the system that ruled Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was not only ‚Äòtransitional‚Äô but formed a rather integrated system in its own right, its special characteristic being that capitalism controlled the state by making use of feudal exploitation and feudal methods of rule. It‚Äôs precisely because capitalism and feudalism developed in combination that the Russian Revolution could not first topple and expropriate the feudal system of ownership but had simultaneously to topple and expropriate the capitalist system of ownership. Many historical and practical problems are easily solved using Trotsky‚Äôs law of combined development.""

* Zheng Chaolin


Otherwise I think it is a a fair summary with only one other minor error: 

&gt; Trotsky classified the Soviet Union as a ""degenerated workers state"" and the Soviet Communist Party as ""bureaucratic centralist,"" also declaring the death of the 3rd international, and beginning the 4th international. 

The chronology is not quite clear here. When Trotsky still considered the Soviet Union ""bureaucratic centrist"" he did not call for a political revolution. Back then his slogan was: ""not revolution but reform"". It was only the experience of the tragic events in Germany 1933 where the German Communist Party enabled Hitler to come to power without a fight due to Stalin's idiotic theory of ""social fascism"". More precisely, it was the inability of the Communist International to do proper self-criticism that convinced him that the USSR was unreformable, and only then did he propose to build a new international. 

Edit: Oh yeah, this part here is also rather confused: 

&gt; ...and the idea that a communist society will be a 'workers' democracy.'

Workers' democracy will come before communism. It is essential for socialist construction. Under communism itself there will be no class of wage workers. Communism, and this includes both of its stages, will be a classless society. Hence this sentence doesn't make much sense.

Also:

&gt; ...another revolution of the workers was necessary to unseat the ""Stalinist"" bureaucracy...

Here I would stress that this revolution is a political and not a social revolution. To quote form Andy Blunden's excellent study of Stalinism:

&gt; Political revolution means the overthrow of the bureaucracy, whilst retaining the state as a weapon against imperialism and capitalist restoration. Political revolution means the independent mobilisation of the working class with a program aimed at the working class regaining political control of the state, and thereby the economy.

&gt;Political revolution was the perspective of the Trotskyist movement from 1933 on, once Trotsky came to the conclusion that regeneration of the Communist Party was no longer possible. Political revolution means the revolutionary overthrow of the Stalinist regime in the USSR. This revolutionary strategy is distinguished from social revolution only because it does not entail expropriation of the private property in the means of production, which had already been carried out (and at the moment of writing, has still not been entirely obliterated).

&gt;Further, such a political revolution does not actually entail the passage of power from one class to another, but simply the taking of political power by the working class from a bureaucracy which has usurped political power from the workers. There was no capitalist class with a social base in private ownership in the means of production in the USSR.

&gt;While the bureaucracy appears before the workers of their own country as no better than any capitalist class, the Soviet state was a force outside of the actual control of imperialism. So long as the growth of the market in the USSR was contained, the USSR remained unquestionably a gain of the working class that had to be defended against the attempt of imperialism to restore capitalism and/or overthrow the state. The perspective of political revolution combined the perspective of overthrowing the bureaucracy with that of defending nationalised property.

Overall Canada, like many European countries, is one of the best places to live in the world.

We don't have as many extremely high paying financial opportunities as some other countries like America, but we also don't have major problems with illiteracy, poverty, crime rate, expensive education and healthcare as some other countries like America.

Our health care is pretty good, I don't personally know anyone who has been screwed over financially by it. I know a handful of people who have gotten botched procedures though, apparently it's more common than it should be, but I don't think its an epidemic. Most good employers will give you nice benefit packages with dental, vision, disability, etc.

People here are polite and friendly, and mostly tend to ""do the right thing"". But they also tend to be more cold than you may be used to. People are less personal, and don't like to be touched as much here as some other countries, such as cheek kissing, hugs, and physical contact during conversations. If you ask for help, you will probably get it, but if you try to get personal, people may become uncomfortable.

Work varies a lot depending on your field, but Canadians do tend to work consistently more than most first world countries. We only have 2 weeks minimum paid vacation, 10 ish statutory vacation days, and most of us work 40 hour weeks. People tend to form close bonds at work and this will probably be where you make most of your friends. For me in tech, I really enjoy the work environment, free food all the time, flexible hours, ability to work from home, every other Friday off, etc. Salaries are all around pretty good for all fields, careers like Police or Teacher tend to pay well here vs places like America, but high end careers like Software Engineer or Doctor, pay more elsewhere.

Buying in a lot of places is very expensive. Getting a place worth around 5x your gross annual salary is probably what most people will do. As someone who is frugal, I thought it was pretty easy. As a side note, North Americans tend to have the lowest rate of savings in the world.
I bought my place at 24 in a big city metro area with a modest paying job, so it's definitely doable.
Note that Montreal is much cheaper than other big city areas.

Politics are politics, we are pretty liberal / left leaning as far as the world overall goes. Our politicians aren't really any different than you would get anywhere else, depends who is in on the podium at the time.

Mas.... ent√£o posso ou n√£o posso experimentar o gin√°sio? Pelos vistos pude.... Eu n√£o treinei la em Dezembro (nem podia aparentemente, visto que o contrato so come√ßava em Janeiro). Eu nem lhe disse se queria comecar em Janeiro ou Dezembro, ou se queria comecar sequer.... N√£o lhe disse nada. 

Nem enganei ninguem porque nem sequer estava a espera que ele j√° n√£o estivesse l√° quando sa√≠.... Se ele estivesse eu tinha dito ""olha muito obrigado mas n√£o quero porque s√≥ tens um banco de supino e um plataforma de deadlift e em dias em que isto estiver cheio demoro 3 horas a treinar"".

For one example, take a Classical Era Southern Europe (around the time of the Punic Wars), then have it criss-crossed by a continent-spanning system of underground railway stations. Another example, a little more ""out there"" as it leans into alternate history, could be in an alternate Islamic Golden Age where Rome never rose to prominence, and advanced alchemical transmutation is enabled by the cultivation of mysterious self-replicating substances that might have come to Earth by way of a meteor shower.

In regards to your questions:

You can choose between a bunch of prepaid sim providers (I've used Masmovil, Lycamobile and others) where you get at least something around 4-8gb for 10-20‚Ç¨ per month which should be totally sufficient for everyday use assuming you have wifi at your place. Most also include unlimited calls.

No need to turn data off at any point.

Using the sim card in other countries: This depends on where you travel. If you travel inside the EU, you can use roaming (all of your data and calls) free of charge! Travelling outside the EU I would either not use roaming at all or just get a simcard in that country as well.

All_Gonna_Make_It,1380478987.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_dbq4r,False,"&gt;Automation is THE solution to the human condition

Wishful thinking imo. When automation is widespread enough, corporation will have ALL the power. A company like  Facebook will say ""The US wants a crazy tax hike on big business so that OUR profits fund the citizens?"" and then they will find a country with a more favorable tax structure. Countries- especially developing ones like those in Africa- will bend over backwards for corporations. Corporations would only remain in a UBI country if they gained more power in exchange for the higher taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

So 20 years from now, I can only see two outcomes:

1) Business is driven out of the West due to high taxes. The population is out of work and out of money, without a way to get either. Corrupt leaders in developing countries have seen business movement as an opportunity to grow their country's economy by offering extremely low tax rates to corporations at the expense of their own citizens. The US, Canada, and much of Europe are now trending towards peasant.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Corporations agree to pay more in taxes to fun UBI in exchange for more power. Now Amazon and Facebook have a monopoly on all of your personal information, run government, or own the country's resources and infrastructure.

The truth is, I have recently unveiled a shocking truth that goes back centuries. In short, the Dutch are planning to conquer the world with the power of Christmas. The origins of this conspiracy go back to the mid 17th century. After gaining independence in the eighty years war from the Spanish the Netherlands established itself relatively quickly as a power in Europe. However, they were never taken seriously and mocked for their wooden shoes by the rest of Europe. This, in turn, angered the Dutch who started to plot the fall of all nations who mocked them. This is how they created ""Sinterklaas"" The Dutch Santa, and the figure from which St. Nicholas is derived from. I know, I know this may come as a shock but it is true my friends. You may say that evidence of such beliefs were found even earlier in the 1500s, but there is yet another answer for this. You see in the year 2023, the Dutch government hired the services of their most trusted and skilled mercenary,  Jean-Claude Van Damme to travel back in time and create the legends of Sinterklaas to the Dutch people. You may now ask, how will the Dutch use Santa and  Jean-Claude Van Damme to destroy the planet? The answer is simple, every Christmas night, children will hope for gifts under the Christmas tree, but when the plan starts, they will instead find tulips, wooden shoes and even body pillows of  Jean-Claude Van Damme. And when the children inevitably put on their wooden shoes, they will become Dutch! And join the conspiracy to obliterate the planet for mocking them for being defeated by tulips. With an uncountable amount of children, panic will ensue throughout the world and the Dutch will use this to their advantage and conquer the world with the combined magic of Santa and the sheer power of  Jean-Claude Van Damme!

My guess would be that among other factors, the religion and culture part is really important and affected the advancements in science and hindered the countries in becoming industrial. The fact that there was no separation between the Church and the Government is another thing. Availability of natural resources (particularly metals ores and coal/petrol) and the infrastructure to utilize them also probably lacked in many countries, at least, they were not discovered at the time. 

As an interesting piece of information, I have seen somewhere, maybe in a documentary? that the Tsetse fly in Africa is actually a factor why Africa in general is underdeveloped (not applicable to the desert areas)- the disease spread by those flies decimate through cattle population, and so cattle cannot be used for farming as extensively as we were able to use cattle or horses in Europe, especially after creating metal tools (plows? I do not know the english word). This prevented people from being able to farm more effectively, and combined with the harsher climate, it made it very very difficult to farm enough to be able to have enough food supplies from a season to another, also leading to underfed population and then a whole load of other issues related to that.

WiseauWonderShow,1483137502.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1403b6,False,"I'll give you the point about ""it's in the name."" That's very true that names can be used to try and lead a narrative or agenda, I'll concede that absolutely. That being said, the antifascist movement globally has been pretty consistent with its name in the work that they've done. In Greece, where I'm a citizen, Antifa actually successfully repelled the Golden Dawn party from Crete almost entirely through direct action and protest. The Golden Dawn Party being the far right party that closely mirrors the ideologies of the military dictatorship from the early part of the 20th century as well as having similar politics as the military junta that ruled the country from the 60's to the 70's and have very Nazi like beliefs. In France the Antifa movement there has been active alongside the leftist contingency of the yellow vests in seeking an end to neoliberal taxation policies that undermine the poor/working class, and in Portugal the yellow vests and Antifa have been protesting corruption and similar anti worker policies to great success. So that being said, in this case I'm very comfortable with using the ""it's in the name"" argument since across the globe Antifa had proven to consistently be a left wing syndicalism group dedicated to fighting fascism and neoliberalism (which at this point is comfortably fascist-adjacent). 

In most cases Antifa shows up as a counter protesting force, not actually instigators of violence.

I really want an answer of what would happen if you didn't make any unnecessary assumptions, and you just had a large mass of bodies colliding with Europe. I know there would be cataclysmic consequences- probably some kind of wave like a rock dropping into water- and perhaps one of these waves might be enough to throw some Chinese people into space. Perhaps when two waves circle the Earth, they will constructively interfere and *that* wave will be enough to throw some Chinese people into orbit. I don't know enough about fluid mechanics to say.

However, I do know that Force = mass * acceleration. I found [this article](https://www.quora.com/How-much-force-is-required-to-make-a-10-kg-mass-object-go-to-space-or-put-it-in-an-orbit-around-the-Earth) that says it takes 50 kiloNewtons of force to get a 10 kg object into space. I'm going to assume this scales linearly. (50 kN / 10 kg) * (70 kg / person) * 1.4 billion people = 4.9 √ó 10^14 newtons (if I did the math right).

Now I need to produce 4.9 quadrillion newtons of force at the other end of this perfect continental see-saw. [According to this calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/force.php?given_data=mass&amp;f=490000000000000&amp;f_units=newton&amp;m_units=kilogram&amp;a=9.8&amp;a_units=meter+per+second+squared&amp;sf=6&amp;given_data_last=mass&amp;action=solve) I need 50,000,000,000,000 kg of weight to do this. Divide that by 70 kg per person, and you get 714,000,000,000 people.

So I'm going with that.

HARUTO-TONBOGIRI,1539393741.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2eg81o6y,False,"Depends on the god, I suppose. They can range from cold, stoic, and calculating, to cheerful, ditzy, and a bit absentminded. When I was messing around with Shinto/Buddhist gods, I sat down and did a lot of research into Izanami-no-Mikoto, the Japanese primordial goddess of death and creation. Once I got a feel for her general story in the mythology, I worked out how I would reiterate her in my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

What came out was a woman who was incredibly cheerful, eager to help others get out of their slump, and always willing to lend a listening ear. She's a bit scatterbrained and has a difficult time adjusting herself to modern, human society, since the country is so different than it was hundreds of years ago. She's by far the sweetest character in the story, but as one of the oldest surviving goddesses, she holds a lot of secrets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Centuries before the main character would meet her, Izanami was a very different woman, to the point that her fellow gods dubbed her 'Izanami the Cruel'. She was said to be hateful, baleful mass murderer. She repeatedly broke Heaven's laws and ordinances, but no one could ever punish her for it. No one had the strength to kill her, and then there was the question of who would take her place as the goddess of death if they did win against her. No one wanted that job. Constantly being able to get away with breaking the rules only made her fellow deities hate her more. It's later revealed why and how she ended up like that, and it mostly plays off of Shinto mythology.

&amp;#x200B;

Izanami had her dream life when she was with Izanagi and all of her children, before the age of Man. She was a natural home-maker and wanted to keep building up her family. She ""died"" giving birth to Kagutsuchi, despite her family's best attempts to keep her alive in her charred, almost skeletal state. After she passed, she awoke in the Underworld as a rotten corpse, which led to the classic scene of Izanagi running away from her in Yomi. Years later, she was saved by Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, who fixed her appearance up a little bit, but were unable to rid her of her wintry, pallid skin. When she set foot in the world of the living once more, Izanami saw how much had changed since her death. Her daughter, Mizuhame died in a failed attempt to rescue her from Yomi. Kagutsuchi was alive, but was sealed inside of the sun. Izanagi fell into a languid torpor after his attempt to save his wife, and died an absentminded mute. Izanami's surviving children had grown up and split into two factions. The first were those that sided with Amaterasu and wanted to establish themselves as a pantheon, or a sovereign state of gods. The other faction, led by Susanoo, wanted to make a combined effort to search for their mother and father.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time Izanami came back, those two factions had already warred with each other. Those that were opposed to the formation of a divine state were wiped out almost entirely. Those that sided with Amaterasu were far more preoccupied with ruling over mankind and facilitating the birth of new deities than with preserving the original family. Though Amaterasu and Izanami cooperated to elevate the pantheon, it was pretty clear that the latter held a deadly grudge for the former. But with the pantheon still in its early stages, and Izanami all but alone on the ideological side of things, the two needed each other. Her title as 'Izanami the Cruel' came after she started The Black Death that swept across Europe. Supposedly, it was revenge on the Catholic church after they found Kagutsuchi, branded her a witch (it's a her in this story), and burned her alive.

&amp;#x200B;

So, though Izanami ended up being one of the nicest and sweetest characters in the story, she has a complex past where she was anything but. She made a habit out of fighting cruelty with brutal vengeance and didn't care how many people would die in the crossfire. It took a lot before she was able to confront herself, let go of her pain, and change into a loving, inviting woman. I suppose the deities I write aren't always that different from humans, really. Perhaps their emotions can be taken to extremes because they have the magical powers to act on them. But some of them feel love, hatred, and pain in a similar fashion to humans.

alanquinne,1502333478.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9zf7gxi,False,"They forgot the part that about the Russian monarchy being the most reactionary monarchy in Europe, having stalled Russia's development for decades, so much so that Russia was the most backwards power among the major European countries, centuries behind the others in even basic political and constitutional reforms, and the tsar's obstinate hostility and opposition to acquiescing towards a constitutional monarchy (which he constantly sabotaged and sidestepped) was one of the principle reasons that they were devastated in WWI, and the humiliating loss to imperial Japan in 1905 (which nearly collapsed tsarism then and resulted in a failed uprising, it was held together only by severe repression). In contrast, constitutional monarchies in Britain, Japan, and Germany played a relatively progressive part and *spurred* economic and social development in their countries, while Russia lagged behind. 

An interesting side note, the first modern proto-fascism movement emerged not in Germany, but in tsarist Russia. Viciously anti-semitic, Russo-chauvinistic, pro-absolutist monarchist right-wing populists were thriving in Russia pre-WWI, and often rivalled or exceeded the popularity of the left. Among other things, when they weren't printing pieces like *The Elders of Zion*, or carrying out pogroms, they were desperately trying to prevent any transition  to a western-style liberal constitutional monarchy, believing that the tsar had a 'mystical bond with the people' that had to be maintained and could not be mediated by anyone, much less a parliament. There were even highly competent tsarist government officials (Witte, Stolypin, Durnovo) who desperately wanted to carry out modernizing reforms (in the interest of preventing collapse, and maintaining stability), and it was these people who actually saved the tsarist system from the brink in 1905. And yet 12 years it all went down in ruin, because Nicholas II was a feckless imbecile who was so reactionary, that he refused to mobilize or incorporate the proto-fascist legion of supporters who would have thrown their lives away had he merely asked, because it contravened the principle of 'absolutely autocracy',  and he refused to heed the advice of those competent officials who were still trying to save him. Simply put, he didn't want to be saved. By late 1916, Lenin had lost all hope (he was in exile, and thus didn't have an accurate picture of the events in Russia), and told a group of students that the revolution might never happen, meanwhile, the tsar's own secret police analysts were warning that a revolution was imminent because of how badly the tsarist government had bungled the food supply. Durnovo had predicted some years earlier, in a notorious memorandum to Nicholas II, that a war with highly advanced Germany would almost certainly expose the weaknesses of the tsarist system, and precipitate a social revolution that would end his rule. Durnovo's prescient letter was of course ignored and dismissed.

1917 came around, and suddenly, no one, absolutely no one, not the left wing, not the liberals, not the rabid right wing, not his generals, not his own government officials, absolutely no one, retained any sympathy or loyalty for him, and he was forced to abdicate. Everyone had become completely disillusioned with him. 

That's how backwards and uniquely archaic the Russian monarchy was.

In contrast, Stalin's USSR would rise no more than a generation later from the chaos of the tsarist collapse, WWI, and the Russian Civil War, become a great power, and not only avenge the losses, but avenge them decisively against a Germany and a Japan that were more powerful than they had been in 1905 and 1917 when they originally trounced Russia.

People been repeating this since 1990 when Soviet collapsed. Even as recently as 2014, people saying ""Hard Landing"" for China's economy.

&amp;#x200B;

A broken clock is right twice-a-day, so keep up the baseless predictions that's been consistently proven wrong over and over again.

&gt; They have a massive housing crisis that makes before 2008 look small. 

This has been repeated for years and years since 2014 about a ""hard-landing"" and a ""housing bubble"", this has been thoroughly disproven over and over again.

&gt; And with the one child policy, it means one couple is taking care of two sets of parents and four sets of grandparents as they get older. That, and their population will soon start dropping, which means a slower economy 

You will be hard pressed to convince me that 2 billion population (without One Child Policy) is more advantageous to China's long-term sustainable growth than with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me, without One Child Policy, how would having a 1.8 Billion population be better for China? Ever heard of ""Overpopulation""??

&gt; Its more likely that china will collapse in the next 50 years than become the next super power. 

Wishful non-thinking. China is merely copying the proven export-oriented model of Japan, Korea, Taiwan.  It's a proven model for economic success that's been pioneered by other East Asian nations, Europeans, and American.

&amp;#x200B;

In 50 years, China will be the world's largest economy and likely the leader of the world.

A country can filter foreign betting websites pretty easily, and stop the 90% of people from betting, especially the vulnerable people tricked into spending their salaries in a rigged game.

Internet banning is *technically* easy, but there are numerous downsides:

* you're introducing domain banning as a legal concept, which many people are scared of as it can even more easily be diverted to ban political opposition or other sites critical of the government, porn, Youtube, Wikipedia, ...
* the cheap forms (domain-blocking on DNS level, IP range banning) are easily subverted. DNS blocking only requires changing your router to Google DNS (which many people already do!), IP-range banning is circumvented by gambling sites going on big Cloud IP ranges where blocking introduces huge collateral damage. Intercepting DNS requests to Google requires expensive equipment and won't work once DNSSEC and DNS-over-secure-channel is fully rolled out
* seizing domains only works for local gambling sites, it's much harder to seize .com, .eu or other domains

Want to stop gambling? Fight the causes of the *demand* for gambling, which in very many gambling cases (at least those I know of) are a lack of jobs, a lack of life perspective, and a lack of a decent social support system. Don't fuck around with the Internet, it won't work unless you're China or North Korea anyway.

Tattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of √ñtzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites, including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines and the Andes. These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt (c.

In my country, for example, you have to finish a 4-year HS in order to be able to enroll, and you can't, for example, go and study medicine if you've finished certain trade schools. 

Also, while EU countries generally don't charge tuition for other EU nationals, the cost of tuition for non-EU nationals can be staggering. 

And even with subsidies, if you're below a certain threshold, you're paying for college yourself. The state is also deciding which fields it wants to pay for, and which not. In my country, history gets ~100 state-funded scholarships per generation. Law school, on the other hand, gets ~800.


We have subsidies, and that may be fine, but we have to mitigate the risk by not allowing everyone to join, not allowing people to study whatever they want and not having that much freedom in our education choices. On the other hand, we don't have an entire generation burdened with non-dischargeable debt.  Personally, if I had enough money, US would have been my choice.

&gt; Food irradiation primarily extends the shelf-life of irradiated foods by effectively destroying organisms responsible for spoilage and foodborne illness and inhibiting sprouting.[3] Although consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means, because people imagine that the food is radioactive or mutated,[4] all independent research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have confirmed irradiation to be safe.

&gt; [‚Ä¶]

&gt; Food irradiation is permitted by over 60 countries, with about 500,000 metric tons of food annually processed worldwide.[10] The regulations that dictate how food is to be irradiated, as well as the food allowed to be irradiated, vary greatly from country to country. In Austria, Germany, and many other countries of the European Union only dried herbs, spices, and seasonings can be processed with irradiation and only at a specific dose, while in Brazil all foods are allowed at any dose.

&gt; The Cranberries is an alternative rock band from Limerick, Ireland that formed in 1989 and rose to mainstream popularity in the early 1990's. The band consists of Dolores O'Riordan (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Noel Hogan (guitars, vocals, also a member of Mono Band), Mike Hogan (bass, vocals), and Fergal Lawler (drums, percussion, also a member of The Low Network). The band went on hiatus in 2003 and reunited in the summer of 2009.

&gt; Combining the melodic jangle of post-The Smiths indie pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, The Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the indie scene of the early 90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. 

&gt; It wasn't until the lush ballad ""Linger"" became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of ""Linger"", The Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles like ""Dreams"", ""Zombie"" and ""Ode to My Family"". 

&gt; By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.

&gt; During the next few years, the band cancelled a large tour and rumours of a breakup were widespread. In 1999, they released Bury the Hatchet to mixed reviews. In 2001, the band issued Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to rave reviews. The album debuted at number 46 in the US charts. 

&gt; In 2002, The Cranberries released the compilation Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, which was supported by the single ""Stars"".

&gt; In 2003, The Cranberries announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers. They decided to put the next album on hold. After more than a dozen years of relentless touring and promotion, which had seen them clocking up album sales in excess of 43 million and playing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe, the band decided it was time for a break.

&gt; In 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released her debut solo album titled Are You Listening?. Two years later she released her second solo album, No Baggage.

&gt; On 25 August 2009, Dolores O'Riordan announced that The Cranberries will be reuniting for a North American tour to begin in mid-November 2009, to be followed by dates in Europe in early 2010. O'Riordan indicated that the band will be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of The Cranberries classic hits as well as some new music written by the group together.

&gt; The Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto (Canada) from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with producer Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all will be included on the album. The album is scheduled for release on 14 February, 2012.

&gt; On 26 May 2016, the Cranberries announced that they would start their next tour in Europe. The first show was held on June 3.

&gt; A new ""unplugged"" Cranberries album titled Something Else, featuring the band's hits along with three new songs, was released on 28 April 2017 through BMG. The album received mostly positive reviews. 

&gt; On 15 January 2018 lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died unexpectedly in London. She was 46 years old.

Meaning there hasn‚Äôt been as much time for it to be one contiguous market. While the US has always worked hard to maintain interstate commerce. 

That means the US was a much larger market, Germany, being the largest EU market only having 82 million people to the US‚Äô 350 million. 

Then you combine that with the fact that for most of America space is far cheaper, meaning grocery stores can be larger and have more shelf space, giving a wider variety of what can be offered. 

Does this mean America is freer? No, but it does mean we have more choices, on average at a typical grocery store. For example the average grocery store in the US has 40,000 skus, while in the EU it is closer to 10,000, often less. 

The next question then is, is more choices better? Research lately has shown that people actually prefer less choices at the grocery. Which is why stores like Aldi (having closer to 3,000 skus) are doing much better than other major brands. Even in the US companies such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe‚Äôs who stock mostly store label products are growing faster than tradition grocery stores.

Kaiserjager,1491794295.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16xxg8,False,"""Also, ever notice that the further someone is from white European heritage, the less specific it becomes?""

This is not necessarily true. I've seen people say Japanese-American for example, but I have also just heard ""Chinese"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Filipino"" without a hyphen. With ""African-American"" I believe it is less specific due to the history of slavery.

Also, even many people in America who identify as a hyphenated Americans don't necessarily consider themselves from that country. Someone might consider themselves Polish-American, but this doesn't mean they think they are Polish. For example, I grew up in an area with a large Polish-American population and a friend of mine's father grew up only speaking Polish for the first few years of his life, even going to a school taught in Polish until he was 5. There are still people in that town that only speak Polish despite being born here. Anyway his answer to the two questions of ""Are you American?"" and ""are you Polish-American?"" would be yes, but he doesn't think he's Polish in the sense of being from Poland because he isn't, but being Polish-American is a part of his identity due to the culture in America he grew up in. That said I do think the hyphenated American thing is stupid for a variety of reasons but I am not sure it is completely fair to say that this country is obsessed with ethnicity, I think for many it's just that the concept of American identity can be tricky due to a variety of subcultures and things they do differently from others, not that that doesn't get conflated with nationality. Then there is also foolishness like this ""Italian"" and his disapproval of pizza in Italy and love for NY Pizza, I mean everybody knows North Jersey has the best pizza.

The people support it. The corporate dems don't.

&gt; Last time I checked when you tell people their taxes will be raised to pay for MFA support drops like a rock.

So think about it for longer than a tweet. If you don't have to pay premiums or worry about coverage and can get preventative care (making the system cheaper as time goes on), it will result in a better society overall. People in Europe are willing and happy to pay more in taxes because they get so much value for it (not to mention helps boost confidence in government). You can't just end the conversation with higher taxes = bad. They have to be told what they stand to gain.

Correct. But Augustus also never called himself emperor. He actively refused royal titles, and styled himself the simple *princeps* or ""first citizen"" of the republic. His court was the senate of Rome.

By [this other article ALSO by the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31924912), using the European counting standard, Hershey's milk chocolate actually has 30% cocoa (non-fat cocoa powder + cocoa butter) vs. Cadbury's 23%.

_Steamed_Hams,1520384189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_109jzthf,False,"If there is a relatively smooth Brexit, most of those polled expect growth to pick up later in the year. However, several respondents warned that Brexit brinkmanship was doing lasting damage to the economy, with the prolonged uncertainty leading businesses to take irreversible decisions.

‚ÄúBusiness is now being told to prepare for a no deal Brexit and increasing numbers will relocate some operations. These decisions may not be reversed, even in the event of the best possible outcome for the economy, which would be to remain in the EU,‚Äù said Marian Bell, a former member of the monetary policy committee who runs the consultancy Alpha Economics.

Many respondents noted that even if a disorderly Brexit was averted, uncertainty over the UK‚Äôs future trading relations will limit the potential for a rebound, with the UK unlikely to return to pre-referendum levels of growth or to perform as well as its main trading partners.

‚ÄúEven if we sign a withdrawal agreement, I don‚Äôt believe this will unleash a spree of business investment. The UK is going to be approached generally on a ‚Äòcare and maintenance‚Äô basis by multinationals,‚Äù said Mark Gregory, chief economist at EY.

With businesses set for caution, the growth outlook hinges on consumers‚Äô willingness to spend. In theory, UK households are under less strain than a year ago, with real incomes finally rising as a tight labour market fuels pay increases and lower oil prices rein in inflation.

Yet many economists noted that consumer confidence looked fragile, and suggested that people were starting to worry that a hard Brexit would lead to job losses or hit house prices.

More than half said households would feel no better off at the end of 2019. One described real wage growth as ‚Äúweedy‚Äù and several said any change in living standards would depend more on how Brexit affected the pound and asset prices.

Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said low income households would not share equally in wage growth, with families facing a squeeze on benefits payments.

David Miles, professor at Imperial College, agreed. ‚ÄúA rise in real wages of, say, 1 to 2 per cent is hardly noticeable to most households,‚Äù he said. Chris Pissarides, at the LSE, said Brexit effects would mean ‚Äúthey will feel worse off, even if there is more money in the bank‚Äù.

Other respondents said consumers would feel slightly better off ‚Äî but cautioned that this would not necessarily boost consumption.

Jagjit Chadha, director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said high household debt levels suggested some people had been maintaining spending ‚Äúby borrowing from a richer future‚Äù ‚Äî and were now likely to pay off some debt rather than spending more.

Respondents offered a range of opinions on what could be done to boost the economy, with some seeing more scope than others for policymakers to support growth.

Prof Miles, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said interest rates were ‚Äúunlikely to change much at all‚Äù, since the BoE had little scope to cut them if there was a sharp shock.

‚ÄúIn the event of a chaotic Brexit, the BoE will lower rates. However, the impact will be limited, if a cut in rates is not accompanied by expansionary fiscal policy,‚Äù said Ann Pettifor, director of the network Policy Research in Macroeconomics.

Opinion was split on the chances of fiscal loosening. About half the respondents said the government would not live up to its promise to ‚Äúend austerity‚Äù in 2019 beyond the spending measures announced in the October budget. Several argued that chancellor Philip Hammond could not do more without breaking his own fiscal rules.

But a similar number said easing austerity was now a political imperative, regardless of Brexit. ‚ÄúThe government is not strong enough now to resist pressure to oil squeaky wheels,‚Äù said Howard Davies, chairman of RBS.

Many economists pointed out that Brexit prevented the UK tackling broader issues, such as chronic under-investment, poor productivity, fraying public services and ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù levels of deprivation.

‚ÄúThe big picture is that of an economy transitioning to a lower-growth equilibrium, marked by deficient domestic demand,‚Äù said Konstantinos Venetis, of the consultancy TS Lombard. ‚ÄúPolitical instability only makes matters worse.‚Äù

There are a number of details to be considered, of course.

Firstly the general agreement with Sweden as has been mentioned in other comments. NATO or not, they're likely our main ally.  
Also, while Finnish neutrality is partly a fa√ßade, it is taken seriously enough to be discussed as a problem with being in the EU; it does allow us to punch above our weight class diplomatically by acting as a neutral-ish part between NATO and Russia.  
Then, you have to weigh the impact on the economy of Russian retaliation for joining against the relative change in likelihood of being invaded.  
Also, the Finnish army largely consists of conscripts, which may complicate aiding other countries.  
Finally, though this one is anecdotal, a lot of people may not quite trust NATO to uphold their part of the deal in case  something does happen. Historically Western countries have been quite happy to completely ignore Finland whenever suitable for realpolitik. If this happens again, joining would mean potentially having to help Trump invade whichever sovereign country pisses him off on Twitter, while dealing with massive economic fallout from giving up the last pretence to neutrality, without getting anything in return but empty promises that may or may not deter an invader depending on how much they are believed.

So basically the disparity in the canadian schools that were used in this study was due to teacher bias through grade inflation. 50% of the grade is due to exam results, 50% is due to teacher evaluation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of recent history, teacher assigned marks were disproportionally higher than the exam marks, or otherwise known as ""grade inflation"". While grade inflation in and of itself is not entirely uncommon, usually covering up declining educational standards, the inflation of girls' grades were significantly and consistently higher. Meanwhile, the exam results from boys in provincial exams were equal or higher than those of girls in 5 out of 6 subjects.

According to Dr. Jim Dueck, this discrimination is prevalent throughout north america and western europe. It is also part of the reason why a lot of higher educational institutions now have a higher female to male ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, there is a growing body of research that attributes the apparent advantage females enjoy in the public school system to their more compliant and more passive behaviour in the classroom. Males are more likely to exhibit skepticism about subject matter and to challenge their instruction. This behavioural difference appears to  be the source of negative discrimination towards males in modern schools.

yodatsracist,1353699705.0,,soc,[],,Sociology of Religion,dark,text,t2_9ouov,False,"So globalization is often characterized by increasingly free flows of goods, services, capital, information, and people across international boundaries. Focusing *only* on that last one (the free flow of people), there‚Äôs good research that seems to indicate that the free flow of lower skilled immigrants causes a right way populist backlash in a way that the free flow of higher skilled immigrants does not (think, for example, of the flows of asylum seekers to Europe vs. Canada‚Äôs points based immigration system, if you‚Äôre familiar with either of these). See for example, ‚Äú[Skill of the Immigrants and Vote of the Natives: Immigration and Nationalism in European Elections 2007-2016](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25077)‚Äù by economists Simone Moriconi, Giovanni Peri, and Riccardo Turati. 

&gt; In this paper we document the impact of immigration at the regional level on Europeans‚Äô political preferences as expressed by voting behavior in parliamentary or presidential elections between 2007 and 2016. We combine individual data on party voting with a classification of each party's political agenda on a scale of their ""nationalistic"" attitudes over 28 elections across 126 parties in 12 countries. To reduce immigrant selection and omitted variable bias, we use immigrant settlements in 2005 and the skill composition of recent immigrant flows as instruments. OLS and IV estimates show that **larger inflows of highly educated immigrants were associated with a change in the vote of citizens away from nationalism. However the inflow of less educated immigrants was positively associated with a vote shift towards nationalist positions. These effects were stronger for non-tertiary educated voters and in response to non-European immigrants.** We also show that they are consistent with the impact of immigration on individual political preferences, which we estimate using longitudinal data, and on opinions about immigrants. Conversely, immigration did not affect electoral turnout. Simulations based on the estimated coefficients show that immigration policies balancing the number of high-skilled and low-skilled immigrants from outside the EU would be associated with a shift in votes away from nationalist parties in almost all European regions.

So, it‚Äôs not as simple globalization (here, the free flows of people) help lead to outcome X, but the specifics of how globalization is handled/implemented. I imagine for the other flows, it similarly depends not merely on the existence of such flows, but how they are specifically implemented.

frizzle_,1331567561.0,,english,[],,South East London,dark,text,t2_75icd,False,"Neoliberalism¬†or¬†neo-liberalism[1]¬†is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with¬†laissez-faire¬†economic liberalism¬†and¬†free market¬†capitalism.[2]:7[3]Those ideas include¬†economic liberalizationpolicies such as¬†privatization,¬†austerity,¬†deregulation,¬†free trade[4]¬†and reductions in¬†government spending¬†in order to increase the role of the¬†private sector¬†in the¬†economy¬†and¬†society.[12]¬†These market-based ideas and the policies they inspired constitute a¬†paradigm shift¬†away from the post-war¬†Keynesianconsensus which lasted from 1945 to 1980.[13][14]
English-speakers have used the term ""neoliberalism"" since the start of the 20th century with different meanings,[15]¬†but it became more prevalent in its current meaning in the 1970s and 1980s, used by scholars in a wide variety of¬†social sciences[16][17]¬†as well as by critics.[18][19]¬†Modern advocates of free market policies avoid the term ""neoliberal""[20]and some scholars have described the term as meaning different things to different people[21][22]¬†as neoliberalism ""mutated"" into geopolitically distinct hybrids as it travelled around the world.[5]¬†As such, neoliberalism shares many attributes with other concepts that have contested meanings, including¬†democracy.[23]
The definition and usage of the term have changed over time.[6]¬†As an¬†economic philosophy, neoliberalism emerged among European¬†liberal¬†scholars in the 1930s as they attempted to trace a so-called ""third"" or ""middle"" way between the conflicting philosophies of¬†classical liberalism¬†and¬†socialist planning.[24]:14‚Äì15¬†The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which neoliberals mostly blamed on the¬†economic policy¬†of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term ""neoliberal"" tended to refer to theories which diverged from the more¬†laissez-faire¬†doctrine of classical liberalism and which promoted instead a¬†market economy¬†under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the¬†social market economy.
In the 1960s, usage of the term ""neoliberal"" heavily declined. When the term re-appeared in the 1980s in connection with¬†Augusto Pinochet's¬†economic reforms¬†in¬†Chile, the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and¬†laissez-faire¬†capitalist set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of¬†Mont Pelerin Society¬†economists¬†Friedrich Hayek,¬†Milton Friedman¬†and¬†James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as¬†Margaret Thatcher,¬†Ronald Reagan¬†and¬†Alan Greenspan.[6][25]Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of¬†political economy.[6]¬†By 1994, with the passage of¬†NAFTA¬†and with the¬†Zapatistas' reaction to this development in¬†Chiapas, the term entered global circulation.[5]¬†Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last couple of decades.[17][26]

\- A stable, long-standing clan with passion and a burning desire for all things Destiny

\- A place to call home (this is a big one!)

\- A platform for both PvE and PvP with like-minded players

\- Players who are looking to be part of a team for the long term. We don‚Äôt want players who log on once a week solely for a raid and aren‚Äôt active in Discord!

\- Players with a good raiding background, but also willing to improve and thorough knowledge about the game

Well, there's three ways to go; 

* Apply for a Combined residence and employment permit at the Immigrant and Naturalisation Service (IND). Check here: [https://ind.nl/en/work](https://ind.nl/en/work). Please note; you can ask your future employer to request the permit for you. This helps accelerate and increase your chances! 

* Apply for a family reunification (since your GF lives here?). You will probably need to apply to be legal partners. I can imagine you might not want to do this Here: [https://ind.nl/en/family](https://ind.nl/en/family)

* Apply for a study permit here: [https://ind.nl/en/study](https://ind.nl/en/study). You will need to enrol and finish in a study, which costs at least ‚Ç¨20k per year.

Here's the costs that are involved, looks like you (or probably your future employer) will need to pay ‚Ç¨285 for your permit and it's renewals. [https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Costs.aspx](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Costs.aspx)

gardenofjew,1323045629.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6dh6i,False,"&gt;&gt;we know for a fact that if you average the height of a man and a woman, then either add 2.5 inches (for a boy) or subtract 2.5 inches (for a girl) we can predict with excellent confidence the eventual adult height of their child +/- an inch. Predictions are more likely wrong at the extremes with some reversion to the mean, but you can predict height better than just about any other polygenic phenomenon (and excepting people with things like achondroplasia or gigantism, it's definitely polygenic).

You can do the same thing with IQ, FYI. If you know the IQ of someone's biological parents, you can make very rough estimates about their likely IQ. If you know the estimates of their siblings, their uncles and aunts, their grandparents, in addition to their parents, you can make better, but still noisy estimates. It is a straightforward consequence of IQ being polygenic and strongly heritable-- the phenotypes of relatives are useful for predicting hte phenotype of offpring.

&gt;&gt;It's almost certainly significantly heritable (though even that statement is controversial)


**This is not controversial**. This is demonstrated in 100+ years of extremely consistent results in behavioral genetics-- starting with Galton and his study of adopted sons of eminent individuals, then Cecil Burt, then onto other twin studies, Bouchard, Minnesota Twin Studies, more modern extended-family methods, etc. It is among the most replicated results in psychology. To pretend otherwise is dishonest.

&gt;&gt;The Dutch are certainly the tallest people in the world right now - but they weren't 400 years ago (as evidenced by door frames). What changed? Was it genetic drift? No. It was nutrition.

I'm not sure that this is actually true. Was the rank order of height among different human populations drastically different 100 years ago? How about 500 years ago?

European Americans had better access to nutrition than Europeans for a while, and were consequently quite tall relative to Europe. Now Denmark is quite a bit taller. But Danish-Americans are still taller than other Americans. And height increases have stopped-- almost like there's a ceiling on how good an environment has to be before it's good enough and stops affecting a phenotype. 

Even if it was, gene-environment interactions in height do not make empirical study of intelligence an impossibly challenging subject. You can do stuff like admixture analysis ala medical genetics, polygenic scores of intelligence in different groups (currently not possible because of the problem of linkage decay in GWAS studies + underrepresentation of most minorities in GWAS datasets), etc. You can also test for gene-environment interactions in more traditional behavioral genetics studies, and while those exist to some degree for some other traits, like educational attainment and alcohol consumption, they don't exist for IQ. 

Regarding group membership not being a great predictor of traits-- sure, but it depends on the trait and the group. Basically any Pygmy is shorter than any non-Pygmy population, excepting people with achondroplasia or other types of dwarfism.  And just because something is not a perfect predictor, doesn't mean it isn't useful. Medicine uses shitty but better than nothing predictors all the time.

Oh, ok. I've been there. Now I'm less active, but I used to post ideas and discussions, and I experimented a lot.

Let's see, for some basic tips:

* there are 2 types of formatting on reddit, Fancy Pants (the default, which shows you the style while you write it) and Markdown; if you're in Markdown, when you want to add a new line, at the end of a line you need to add 2+ white spaces, otherwise Markdown won't interpret it as a new line
* choose carefully the time when to post, considering timezones; you might want to choose a time where both american and european redditors are awake, and maybe in a break (like a time that simultaneously gets lunch break for americans and work end for europeans; something like 18pm in Rome time should work; google it to see what time it is in your timezone)
* use synthetic titles that fully explain the core concepts of your idea (for example, you might have tried summarizing your rework concept in the title itself)
* add the TLDR at the beginning of the post, not at the end
* highlight the TLDR as much as you can, for example make it bold like here (**TL;DR**) and separate it from the rest of the text with something (like this: --------------)

I do not accept that Marx's ideas are disproved by a totalitarian state imposing totalitarianism on their people and various satelitte states while calling it Communism or Socialism. I take Commuism to mean basically what Marx meant, and Socialism as a broader term given to all attempts to curb capitalism by way of unions, worker rights, and redistribution of the wealth generated within a society, by the whole of that society. This includes the social democracy parties of the Nordic countries and most of Western Europe.

The Nordic countres, where such 'social democracy' has actually been tried, we have better equality and more certain civil rights.

The attitude towards the opioid epidemic needs to change drastically. Restricting opioids to the point that legitimate pain patients does nothing but harm and does absolutely nothing to help the epidemic. In fact, it makes it worse because addicts will just turn to heroin. Many pain patients commit suicide because they can't get relief from their suffering. Addiction is a disease, not a moral issue or character flaw. The argument for prescription heroin and other replacement drugs is just, ""Yeah but they're doing heroin!!""

Leaving aside the impossibility of measuring something as inherently subjective as ""greatest country"", you should concentrate on proving the US is mediocre to back up your premise.

You state the metrics that comprehensively valuate countries, and then give examples of one's that beat the US on balance. The challenge will be others who point out things you leave out.

From my subjective point of view, the first division between ""good"" country and ""bad"" country would be the base availability of life. ""no matter what the socioeconomic circumstances, does a citizen have a reasonable expectation they will have food, shelter, and security"". As with *most* first world countries, the US is a solid ""yes"".

Then you move past necessities to comfort.

""no matter what the socioeconomic circumstances, does a citizen have a reasonable expectation of a *comfortable* life.

Even the very poor in the US have climate control, leisure entertainment, and some mobility. Again, *most* first world countries do as well, although it is narrowing more.

After needs, and physical comfort/leisure, I would put the nebulous ""freedom"" as the next priority. Freedom is tough because different people value different freedoms. Europeans value the freedom to be responsible for their personal security less importantly than many Americans. Therefore they don't see much value in freedom to have personal weapons.

Freedom of movement is near universal among first world countries, but does ding some of the edge cases.

Freedom of speech is the same as above.

Freedom to succeed, or improve your circumstances is incredibly important, but also impossible to make a comprehensive determination. It is not universal to every human, regardless of country. A low intelligence, low ambition, weak work ethic person won't likely improve their circumstances wherever they are. Now other countries, especially in Europe, may have more support to those trying to improve themselves, but it could be argued the US has the diversity of opportunities that other first world countries do not. 

I think it pretty obvious that ""mediocre""  is a silly label to put on the US. Regardless of our flaws, opportunity outweighs obstacles to any who are capable and ambitious. Every first world country has its problems in different areas. You can cherry-pick metrics to make grand statements about any of them. I just think we should look at how populations actually live before trying to insist one place is comprehensively better than another. There isn't a huge exodus out of the US to other countries. If you want to compare equitable population size and diversity, you would have to compare to the EU as a whole. If you look at the EU as a single entity, it is pretty easy to pick out ""bad"" areas that an unfair person could trumpet.

But it has the effect that ends up stifling smaller club's growth, thus maintaining a status quo of large teams. It allows the rich clubs to stay rich while poorer clubs struggle to keep up with the huge spending of those above them.

Originally, it was intended to stop rich owners pumping money into the club in loans, who could then legally demand it back. If the club can't meet repayments, it could potentially be forced into liquidation (the selling of assets to continue repayment). UEFA didn't want clubs, many of whom have existed for over 100 years, to essentially disappear purely because of greed from rich owners.

The problem is that the majority of club owners are not like this, and as I said previously it means clubs cannot spend the same on players as big clubs.

We are one of the leading countries in wood industry

We have one of the best air qualities in the world because of our forests

We are one of the most diplomatically outreached countries

Our passports rank in top 5 strongest

We hosted meeting of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin

Tourism to North Finland is exploding

Our citizens are the happiest in the world

Our education system is the second to best after south korea

Our country ranks always as one of the top countries in Pisa tests (leaving u.s. far behind)

The successes of Finland in winter war was one of the reasons why Hitler attacked Soviet Union without preparing well enough

Finland has one of the most efficient healthcare systems

Finland has started big trades with China, leading to great economic advance and China will do even more co-operation with Finland and the other Europe after US set the customs, this will also make us more workplaces

Also we are one of the most equal countries

And we have little to no corruption

To my last point: Our country and the whole rest of Europe isn't divided to liberal left and authoritarian right, like the U.S. is.

Still think we are irrelevant?

Also, if you are so insecure about Europe being better, I'm gonna use Ben Shapiro's words and say: Facts don't care about your feelings

Also I could have said any European country as my example of a better society, like Germany for instance or France.

In Afghanistan, the US has had troops on the ground for nearly 20 years. I'm sorry, but if whatever objective you were aiming to achieve wasn't reachable in nearly two decades, and you *still* don't have a clear outline for what you want to get done before you leave or when that job will be done... it's never going to happen. As for Syria... shouldn't there be some kind of public case made, some kind of general buy-in, before soldiers are sent in to occupy a foreign nation? When did this happen? When did the public debate take place? And again, what's the clear goal you're aiming to achieve there, how soon can you achieve it, by what methods?

However... the idea of breaking up NATO is much much less practical.

The fact that we've enjoyed nearly a century of peace and prosperity since then is a testament to how successful they've been. And...

Gun violence - is not an issue (considering our culture and the number of guns in the United States. Gun violence is generally uncommon. The average American will never have to deal with gun violence. Period. It‚Äôs rare.

Education - yes, we accrue way more debt that most countries. That does not mean our education system is bad. America should change its name to ‚Äúland of first world problems‚Äù. Other countries send students TO America to get their education. It‚Äôs less common to leave to get a degree. That‚Äôs a fact. Our general system and our credentials actually mean more than most other place (partly because we choose what we want to accept as a par education. Interestingly enough the fact that America is a leading nation in deciding something like that speak volumes to our influence, importance, power, and education system. Could it be improved? Absolutely. Is there an education crises related to quality of education. I would absolutely say no.

Politics - what other countries don‚Äôt realize is that our politics affect them almost more than they affect us. As a left leaner who HATES Donald trump. He honestly hasn‚Äôt affected myself or anyone I know. However I‚Äôm very active in opposition to trump. Europeans would have you believe that America is falling apart due to trump what that couldn‚Äôt be father from the truth.

Politics to Americans is recreation. We argue about politics out of boredom (this is where I‚Äôm going to get downvoted most, but it‚Äôs true). Now, are MOST people 100% unaffected by trump in America? Hell no. Many have lost jobs and money. However again, those that are *seriously* affected are in fact a vast minority. 

In other words, trump isn‚Äôt enough to destroy this country. Even though outsiders believe that to be true.

Gun violence- again, Europeans really enjoy telling us what we should and should not value. 

Americans value owning guns. Plain and simple.

You can not peacefully take away guns from Americans. Any politician with power that would announce a ban on guns would be hard pressed to keep their job. 

What we have to do is continue what we‚Äôre doing and regulate as best we can. 

School shootings aren‚Äôt common 

a BB gun near a school is NOT a school shooting 

An accidental discharge of a weapon is NOT a school shooting 

One person being killed by a gun unrelated to school and near school grounds is NOT a school shooting 

A stray bullet landing in a school zone is NOT a school shooting.

Every day police pull over 50,000 people. All our police carry guns

50,000 interactions with police A DAY. 

Now compare that to how many people police kill each day.

See? We don‚Äôt even have a police brutality problem. Institutionalized racism is not violent. It has to stay quiet. Police brutality is the worst way to express racism. 

We do not have a police issue.

Here is one issue we have.

Other countries telling us what to do while they ignore riots(France), isolation(UK), segregation(SA), force military conscription(various), have extremely difficult citizenship requirements(Germany), control a wasteland with the air quality of a 40 year old chain smoker(China), and have a drunk driving rate TWICE as high as the UK(Canada), 

Fix your shit Europe, Asia...and everyone else.

America is fucking fine. 

Edit: I want to clarify. There are Americans being affected. But let‚Äôs take this holiday season for example. Pretty quiet huh? Weird how the ‚Äúcrises‚Äù we‚Äôre in can wait until after the holiday season. This is a testament to how nonchalant we really are about politics. We can afford to ignore politics for a couple months 

Edit 2: I forgot to mention FREEDOM. Go to China and say ‚Äúfuck the Chinese President‚Äù. Go to almost any European nation and speak harshly against the government. I‚Äôm very curious to see the comparative consequences.

Since you seem to just have copy/pasted the bulk of your comment, I'm sure you won't mind if I copy/paste my reply from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ab6vdp/no10_admits_there_is_still_more_work_to_do_to_get/ecytftv/?context=1)!

So, firstly I note that you have only listed a few EU countries' GDP as evidence that the EU is in trouble, rather than all EU GDP data, and only Q3 numbers at that rather than than the last several quarters. Also, no link to where you are getting these numbers from. Also, you add in the USA in a conversation about the EU GDP statistics, because.... why? Seriously, why did you add that in?

According to the data taken from [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9437650/2-07122018-AP-EN.pdf/eadec005-b37c-42e2-a8e7-a8bfc2e74f1d), which was in turn found via the [Eurostat website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/national-accounts), we see the following:

UK: 2017 Q4 +0.4, 2018 Q1 +0.1, Q2 +0.4, Q3 +0.6

Germany: 2017 Q4 +0.5, 2018 Q1 +0.4, Q2 +0.5, Q3 -0.2

Sweden: 2017 Q4 +0.6, 2018 Q1 +0.8, Q2 +0.5, Q3 -0.2

Lithuania: 2017 Q4 +1.3, 2018 Q1 +1.0, Q2 +0.9, Q3 -0.3

Italy: 2017 Q4 +0.3, 2018 Q1 +0.3, Q2 +0.2, Q3 -0.1

So from just the countries you originally listed we can see overall positive numbers over the prior 3 quarters with only negatives in the one quarter you chose to display. 

Hmm, choosing to display only a narrow part of a data set in order to support a point? [There is a name for that sort of thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking). 

Additionally, given that the UK has strong growth while *inside* the EU, would you agree that this shows that the EU is, at the very least, not necessarily a barrier to GDP growth?

&gt;Germany, Italy and France also look to have a bad Q4. 

Citation needed.

&gt;But as these figures show, the UK will have had a good Q4.

Citation needed.

&gt;Consider that the countries that have pledged eternal loyalty to the EU are being Flushed Down the Toilet of Recession.

As far as can be gleaned from the data, they aren't. They have had growth for 3 of the last four quarters -hardly a trip down the shitter. 

Also, you mention France above despite not listing it in the numbers above. Not surprising since with a Q3 of +0.4 it wouldn't have fit in your cherry picker. (its prior 3 quarters were +0.7, +0.2, +0.2, for anyone wondering).

&gt;are being Flushed Down the Toilet of Recession.

Germany, Lithuania, Sweden and Italy are the ***only*** Eu countries not seeing growth in Q3, all of the EU countries (that you failed to list the numbers for) are seeing GDP growth in Q3 *and* in prior quarters.

&gt; Billy Ocean (born Leslie Sebastian Charles, 21 January 1950, Fyzabad, Trinidad) is a Grammy Award-winning British popular music performer who had a string of rhythm and blues-tinged international pop hits in the 1970s and 1980s. He was the main British R&amp;B singer / songwriter of the 1980s. He waited seven years after scoring his first four UK top 20 successes, before accumulating a series of transatlantic successes, including three U.S. number ones.

&gt; He was born in Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago to Grenadian parents, and moved to England with his family at the age of eight. Oceans' musical influence came at an early age of his life, as his father was a musician, and realised he was inline to follow those ambitions as he was growing up. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in London clubs while also working as a tailor in London's Savile Row. He released his first single in 1972 on Spark Records as Les Charles.

&gt; When in Trinidad as a boy he adopted the name Billy Ocean, taking the surname from the local football team 'Ocean's Eleven', who had gotten the name from the famous film of the same name. The next year, 1976, was when he recorded his first album, Billy Ocean, with its first single release, ""Love Really Hurts Without You,"" charting at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and number 22 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. More successes ensued, including ""L.O.D. (Love On Delivery)"". He also wrote songs for other artists, such as La Toya Jackson. In 1981, he scored the U.S. R&amp;B chart with ""Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)"".

&gt; Ocean's period of greatest success began with Suddenly during 1984, and its main single, ""Caribbean Queen"". The song's title and lyrics were changed for different regions, such that the song is also known as ""African Queen"" or ""European Queen"". The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards. The album's title track also became a success, its score maximizing at #4 in both the US and the UK; and the song ""Loverboy"", while also being a #2 US success during 1985, from the album, was also the background music for the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series, Casualty, during 1986.

&gt; Ocean appeared at Live Aid in 1985, singing ""Caribbean Queen"" and ""Loverboy"", from the JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

&gt; His 1986 album Love Zone also sold well. It included the successful singles ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" (the theme from the film The Jewel of the Nile); this was a number one success in the UK and a number two in the U.S.; and ""There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)"" (a U.S. number one, and also a major UK success). Also included were the title track and ""Love Is Forever"", which were #10 and #16 U.S. successes for Ocean, respectively.

&gt; In February 1986, Ocean's video of ""When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going"" was banned by the BBC, owing to non-union members (including Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito) miming to backing vocals.

&gt; Ocean's next album, Tear Down These Walls (1988) featured another number one single, ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car"", while the album was certified platinum.

&gt; His 1993 album Time to Move On failed to produce any major successes, but his 1989 Greatest Hits collection has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation Love Is For Ever made #7 on the UK album chart. Ocean's last studio album for Jive Records was Time to Move On, which he recorded in Chicago with R&amp;B star R. Kelly. It turned out that R. Kelly had been a long-time admirer of the way Ocean was able to mix the more emotive soul style with a crossover popular style.

&gt; In 2002, the University of Westminster awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. The awards ceremony took place in the Barbican Centre, in London. He continues to tour and record in Europe. He lives in Sunningdale, Berkshire with his wife of 27 years, Judy; and their three children Cherie, Antony and Rachel. Ocean is now a patron for Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech. He regularly visits to hold clinics and seminars for the students.

&gt; In October 2007, Ocean commenced his first British tour in over 15 years. In February and March 2008 he toured Australia and the Far East. His new album, Because I Love You was released on 2 February 2009. To coincide with this new tour and album launch, Ocean has been working with Adoseof Design on a website revision which is due March 2009.

The drawback is that it would become wildly more expensive for individuals to fly, so you move toward the situation nearly every other country has: only large commercial entities can afford to fly.

sooprvylyn,1350717921.0,,,[],,Resident Textile Expert,dark,text,t2_9cxrr,False,"Well that's kinda of a hard question to answer...there are a whole lot of brands(nobody can possibly know them all) out there and what makes something worth the money differs from person to person. I'm also not of average size(I'm the giant guy in my 1st link); I don't buy clothes the same way most people do so my experience is mostly limited to market research for the brands I've designed for...which unfortunately aren't the types of clothes most redditors would be into(think Tommy Bahama type stuff). I'm also a little older than the average redditor so that makes it harder to suggest brands that younger guys would be into.  I can certainly give some general guidelines though.

1. If it's super popular hype beast stuff you are gonna be paying for hype(looking at you Supreme).  Same goes for luxury brands, but at least with them you usually get pretty high quality because they have a lot of margin to play with and don't have to cut corners.

2. If it's in your average mall it's likely priced properly, there is a lot of competition for your dollars in the mall.  That said most stores in the mall aren't great quality but kinda low to middle of the road.  Some of the better standard mall options I see posted in here often are j crew, banana republic.  H&amp;M and Zara sorry to say is mostly garbage but that shouldn't surprise anyone here...good deals on fast fashion tho.

3. Anything made in low quantities, especially artisan level, is likely to be very well made and appropriately priced, yet expensive cuz making clothes well is a lot of work.  It's also more likely to be ethically made.

4. Anything made in USA, Europe or japan is generally going to be of good quality and as long as it's not some super popular hype/luxury brand the price should be reasonable for what you get. There is a lot of price/quality breadth with this but its pretty hard to find low quality stuff out of 1st world.countries. The only thing I'd warn is that 1st world doesn't equal ethical, plenty of sweatshops.and shady practices in these countries.  

5. Never skip out on stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx and Nordstrom rack...but burn Ross to the ground with a Molotov(total garbage in Ross).  These stores are gonna give you the best bang for your buck. Not everything in them is gold, but it's easy to find some really really good stuff here at very reasonable prices if you can tolerate last year's style(which is fine for basic bastard stuff).  Brands have to unload unsold product and these are the stores they do this at. Nordstrom rack in particular has some good quality items.  These discounters pay pennies on the dollar for most of the stuff they get so you can get some very very good deals if you know what to look for.


The fact is that any brands that make decent quality and also make popular styles is going to add at least a little label tax, they'd be stupid not to.  My best advice honestly is to learn a bit about fabrics and clothing construction so you can identify quality when you see it first hand. You don't need to be an expert but it would be helpful to know something about the fibers you tend to like(for me its natural fibers), and how to tell good versions apart from bad versions. Go to higher end stores and look at the clothes and fabrics.  Check out the inside of the garment to see how it's sewn together and take note, read the content labels, notice the fabric and what makes it special, that's what you need to look for when shopping other stores. It takes a little while to get good at it but it's a life skills.worth having since you'll need clothes til you die.

I know it's not the list of good guys you wanted but best I can do based on my knowledge base and other limiting factors as mentioned above.

Edit: the number 1 fiber dudes should learn about is cotton.  Cotton has a lot of variance so it's one of the more complex ones to.learn to identify, but it's also one of the most common fibers.  There is a big difference between the cotton in an etro button down and the cotton in an h&amp;m tee shirt.  One will fall apart in a few washes and the other should last a few years.  

Edit 2: pricing is often a good indicator of quality, but of course taken with a grain of salt.  Keep in mind what I said about hype/luxury shit above.....FULL RETAIL pricing like this for brands that aren't hype/luxury:

Cotton Tees...above $30 should net you a very good quality tee, if you pay more than maybe $80 on a tee you are certainly getting ripped off...and that $80 tee should feel incredibly soft and smooth with very little fuzziness on the fabric surface. Anything less than $15 is going to be crap....remember this is full retail, and I'm not talking about screen printing blanks like guildan and canvas.

Cotton ocbd/sportshirts...above $50 is where decent quality starts to kick in and goes up to about $200 before you start getting real diminishing returns on price vs quality.  The $50 shirt is what I'd call fair quality and should last a couple years of normal wear....that $200 shirt is pretty high quality, made of long staple yarns, with felled or taped construction throughout as well as high end buttons, high stitch count and maybe some expensive fabric treatments. Below $25 on a sportshirt and you are buying trash.

Jeans/chinos/pants....pricing is pretty similar to shirts so I won't reiterate the same points.  

Althetic stuff...well this is a mixed bag.  Basics like gym shorts/pants and shirts/sweatshirts should run in the $40-100 range, after that you are def paying a label tax.  Technical garments otoh can get pretty pricey and honestly you'll likely pay some label tax on those cuz the big popular brands are the ones who can afford the R&amp;D to develop that stuff.

Other items(sweaters, jackets etc) are harder to generalize pricing on because there is a big variance in raw materials that can drastically effect price.  A wool sweater and a cashmere sweater aren't the same thing so one is gonna cost $50 and the other might cost $300 for a fair price/quality.  Also the items above can be made of fancier fabrics/fibers, but if you are looking at those you probably know why they are $$$$.

It's not, but ignoring the result of the referendum until you get the answer you want is.

Want to have a second referendum? Feel free, after Brexit has occurred and a reasonable period of time has passed. You don't hold a vote again after an election and before the party who won is in office, so why should we do it for this?

&gt;did they know in 2016 that russians were heavily influencing the leave campaign and social media. Did they know the leave campaign repeatedly broke the law to achieve the desired result?

Funny how you don't mention the meddling from the EU...

And in any case, all elections have some meddling from foreign powers, whether through propaganda, or otherwise. That has never been a reason to invalidate an election, and i don't see why it should be different here.

If there is proof that actual votes were changed, and that the numbers of people voting for or against were altered, then that is an entirely different matter, but as far as i know that is not the case, and indeed most of the complaints against the leave campaign could quite easily be applied to the stay campaign as well as most other campaigns in other elections in the UK. 

&gt;did they know that leaving wasnt like turning off a light switch, that it would involve pain and drama?

Same arguments applies to literally every election. 

""Did they know X party wasn't actually going to be able to fullfill Y promise?"", that's a standard occurrence, and has never invalidated an election.

&gt;there were people who were not eligble to vote in 2016, who are now eligible, but we must also silence their voices for the sake of democracy?

Which leaves the question: what is that?  At least for Germany, they only choose U-Bahn train systems that are not linked to trams. Also,  S-Bahn-Trains are not counted.   


Only Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Nuremberg have such a U-Bahn-System, however, many German cities have Mixed Tram/ Underground Trains that travel underground only in congested city centres (eg. in Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, many of the cities in the Ruhr district, Stuttgart, etc.) and S-Bahns, which are trains that run mostly from the suburbs into the city and are run by the National Railways as opposed to local administration.   


These do not technically qualify as Metro systems, because they are strongly liable to outside influence (weather, traffic, accidents etc.) but of course not taking them into consideration is problematic. It heavily distorts the data if you want to make conclusions about public transport in general.   


  
Germany has more large cities than other countries (London and Paris are, together with their suburbs, up to ten times larger than the next city in their country). Local administration generally opted to only tunnel in the city centre for budget reasons.  


All of the cities (sans Hamburg) with a Metro also have a seperate tram system and all of them also have a S-Bahn.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: allways look carefully at your data before you make any conclusions, second: definitions matter.   


I only looked at German systems because I know more about them. I am sure other countries have the same definition problems.  


However, the concentration aspect could be true: if the city dominates its peers, it is more likely to get national subsidies for public transport compared to one amongst many average-sized cities.

&gt; A member of Britain‚Äôs parliament, speaking on condition of anonymity to The Times, said that correspondence had been received from a member of the public, named as Martin Waplington, who said that Corbyn told him he would be voting to leave the bloc.

As was pointed out, it wasn't on camera.  It's a ""he said, he said"".  

But Corbyn's history as a Euro Skeptic is clear.  He voted Leave in the prior vote.  He refused to attend a single Remain Labour rally. Even now, he's clearly against a People's Vote.

And had the statement Corbyn made to Waplington been on camera, Corbyn's political career would likely have ended that night.

InvisibleTextArea,1420025452.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kf78w,False,"&gt; Banca Carige, Italy‚Äôs 10th-largest lender, has had its stock trading suspended and its management temporarily taken over by European regulators after the majority of its board resigned on January 2.
&gt; 
&gt; The European Central Bank appointed three temporary administrators and a surveillance committee to ensure stable running of the lender and its 482 branches. Two of the ECB administrators are the bank‚Äôs current chief executive and chair.
&gt; 
&gt; A statement from the ECB on January 2 said the decision to impose a temporary administration was ‚Äúan early intervention measure aimed at ensuring continuity and pursuing the objectives of a strategic plan‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; The 536-year-old lender also had its shares suspended for the day by Consob, the Italian regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; Banca Carige had presented a plan to the European regulator with an extended deadline of December 30 on how it would solve its balance sheet problems and raise more money.
&gt; 
&gt; The lender had issued two successful bond deals and was planning to convert a further number of its bonds into shares in order to bring its solvency back into line with what European regulators require, according to press statements by Banca Carige.
&gt; 
&gt; But its largest investor refused to approve the last deal to convert the bonds into stock.
&gt; 
&gt; Vittorio Malacalza, a local businessman who is the bank‚Äôs top investor, holding more than 20% of its shares, blocked the share conversion, according to a representative from the ECB.
&gt; 
&gt; In December, Malacalza Investimenti, the businessman‚Äôs holding company, told Reuters that it did not oppose the cash call in principle, but wanted more detail on the bank‚Äôs business plan and merger options, the newswire reported.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank was then meant to propose a new solution that would put its balance sheet in order. During its December 22 shareholder meeting, the bank‚Äôs shareholders and its board could not agree on a plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Two board members then resigned on December 23 ‚Äî deputy chair Lucrezia Reichlin and Raffaele Mincione. On January 2, they were followed by chair Pietro Modiano, chief executive Fabio Innocenzi, and three other directors.
&gt; 
&gt; Modiano and Innocenzi are among the ECB‚Äôs three temporary administrators for Banca Carige, it said in its statement, alongside Raffaele Lener.
&gt; 
&gt; In a January 2 statement from Carige, Modiano said the ECB‚Äôs move would ‚Äúsimplify and strengthen the governance of Carige‚Äù while Lener pledged ‚Äúoperational continuity‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Modiano, a former UniCredit banker, and Innocenzi, who was at UBS, were only brought in to Banca Carige by Malacalza in September, after a clash between the investment group and former chief executive Paolo Fiorentino.",True,False,False,,0,1546448424,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ed354pc,True,t3_abudem,False,t3_abudem,/r/Economics/comments/abudem/ecb_takes_control_of_italys_banca_carige/ed354pc/,,1550777192,8,True,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,r/Economics,public,

kuddlesworth9419,1369589557.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_btage,False,"It's a surplus Polish Lavvu 2 man tent. They are incredibly well designed, robust, high quality, super cheap and perform excellent in the winter. They are very popular amongst long term European campers as they have been up for surplus for decades. Mine is dated 1984 for example but they date back well before then.

It's a very simple yet effective tent, there is only a single aluminium pole however you can get rid of it if you wish and either tie the top of the tent to a branch or make your own centre pole. The tent can be broken into two parts making two poncho's and the arm holes for the tent are commonly used as flume holes for a wood burner. There is however no groundsheet but you can work around this by buying your own groundsheet or what I do is I just use my German rubber poncho as a groundsheet instead. On YouTube there are quite a few people who have heavily modified them to modernise the design somewhat although this increases the weight substantially and means you can no longer use the tent as two poncho's or use them as tarps above. It's a very versatile design. You can even get I think 8 of them to construct a massive tent to house 8 people if you so desire. There is a diagram of this on the internet somewhat. And because it's so simple you can erect the tent up in 5 minutes in a rush you could do it in less time then that.

There is literally no feature on the tent that is wasted it's a fantastic design. You can pick them up for well under ¬£50. I don't blame you by the way I blame the general concurrences. Cotton is looked down upon because it's an old materiel most people shrug it off as such without realising the benefits of cotton and it's disadvantages. They say very childish things like cotton kills without even stopping to understand the fabric at all. They will spout rubbish that companies that have a vested interest in synthetic materials essentially make up. Even cotton manufacturers are guilty of this to just look at Ventile fabric and look at the premiums they can charge for it because of the marketing. They create an ecosystem where people are willing to pay money for fabric that is incredibly cheap to manufacture. There are many different cotton fabrics they are not all created equal but Ventile sits up high essentially because of the marketing but if you look into the different fabrics you will realise there are many fabrics that are are equal to Ventile and in some cases surpass it for a fraction of the costs.

&gt; # [Espa√±a moderniza los tanques de Venezuela pese al embargo de la UE - Runrun](https://runrun.es/noticias/367755/341)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Espa√±a participa en la modernizaci√≥n de los carros de combate del Ej√©rcito de Venezuela pese al embargo de armamento decretado por la UE. La junta interministerial que controla las exportaciones de material militar aprob√≥ en enero de 2018 la venta a Nicol√°s Maduro de repuestos para blindados por 20 millones de euros. La autorizaci√≥n por parte del Ejecutivo de Rajoy se produjo despu√©s de que, el 14 de noviembre de 2017, entrase en vigor el reglamento de la UE que proh√≠be suministrar dicho material a Caracas. Fuentes gubernamentales alegan que el contrato es anterior al embargo, aunque su aprobaci√≥n pol√≠tica fuera posterior.
&gt; 
&gt; Ante el deterioro de la democracia en Venezuela y la falta de respeto al Estado de derecho y a los derechos humanos por parte de Maduro, el Consejo Europeo aprob√≥, el 13 de noviembre de 2017, un embargo a Venezuela de armamento y material susceptible de ser utilizado para la represi√≥n, as√≠ como la congelaci√≥n de activos de una lista de altos cargos del r√©gimen bolivariano que luego se ha ido ampliando.
&gt; 
&gt; El reglamento, que entr√≥ en vigor un d√≠a despu√©s, prohib√≠a suministrar a Venezuela cualquier material incluido en la llamada Lista Com√∫n Militar de la Uni√≥n Europea, que cita expresamente los veh√≠culos terrestres dise√±ados o modificados para uso militar y sus componentes.
&gt; 
&gt; El embargo a Venezuela solo admite dos excepciones: el suministro de material con fines humanitarios o para operaciones de la ONU y organizaciones regionales; y ‚Äúla ejecuci√≥n de contratos celebrados antes del 13 de noviembre de 2017 o de contratos auxiliares necesarios para la ejecuci√≥n de los mismos‚Äù.

jamieandhisego,1393710304.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fich6,False,"These are pretty reasonable liberal interventions into the capitalist economy, but to call a country 'far left' when their leader is not a socialist is quite a stretch.

Luke Savage is quite good on this (among a lot of things): https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality

By American standards, Canada may appear 'left-wing', but by European standards, they're a welfare-state capitalist mixed economy, and these policies are regressions back to the centrist mean. I mean, these are policies that Angela Merkel would probably endorse, and she's a centre-right politician. For most of the developed world, there is a general acceptance amongst elites that in order for capitalism to function, it requires a social safety net to cater for the necessary levels of unemployment that free markets require (as they do not aim for full employment), and a state willing to intervene to ensure citizens are not thrown completely under the wheel of capital (e.g. universal healthcare, worker's rights- and historically speaking, no child labour, the existence of the weekend, etc.).

P.S. Obviously I would tie being left-wing to a combination of both social and economic positions, but it's worth noting that you could conceivably be an anarcho-capitalist white supremacist and think that marijuana should be legalised. 

P.P.S. A socialist would ban fracking and tax oil companies (maybe even nationalise them and turn them into public cooperatives and reorient investment into green energy), not add a carbon tax.

Thanks for any information!

Would you mind linking that again? Because I've seen plenty of people suggesting that Corbyn not wanting to share a platform with Cameron represented him 'sabotaging the campaign', when in reality the opposite is the case. 

&gt; However, if we want to avoid the dire consequences of a no deal Brexit the answer to your point is that he needs to talk to other opponents of Brexit (rather than just his exclusive brotherhood), understand what they will and won't back and then (as leader of the largest opposition party) use that understanding to inform his public position and discussions (which I am sure go on in private) with the EU officials.

But Labour *have* been working with the opposition parties. It was a cross-party motion which proposed a Vote of No Confidence against May's leadership before Christmas. The leadership have been whipping to support amendments by prominent critics of Corbyn (such as whipping to support Umunna and Soubry's joint ammendment to force the government to release their No Deal forecasts).

&gt; The migrants granted citizenship on Wednesday were named as: Jake Gani from Albania, and Ibrahim Mahmoud Mousa and Emad Al Haimi from Egypt.

&gt; Greece was at the epicentre of the EU&amp;#039;s migrant crisis in 2015-2016, when more than a million migrants reached Germany via the Balkans.

&gt;Unfortunately, advocacy for funding to develop nonfluoride approaches for dental caries prevention has so far been compromised by the ‚Äúreligious arguments‚Äù between antifluoridationists and profluoridationists.

i will not take most of what it is stating as serious. 

Also, 

&gt;Resolution 4 of the 2007 World Health Assembly resolution 60.17 urges member states to ‚Äúconsider the development and implementation of fluoridation programmes‚Äù [90]. This statement is a reflection of current realities that artificial water fluoridation is not necessarily the most economical, effective, or affordable way to deliver fluoride to teeth in the 21st century [8, 9].

is clearly taken in the wrong context... how the fuck does the author of this article think that the WHA urging the development and implimentation of programs is a reflection that it is NOT an effective way? (point 3 here)

States EXACT OPPOSITE of what they claim. 

oh, by the way, most of the articles that the reviewer referenced state things similar to [this article](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/ep/2006/00000002/00000003/art00003%3bjsessionid=41q7mfp295app.x-ic-live-03) which was reference #82 in case you were wondering. which state that Even though Flouride MAY be linked to health impacts, it is in levels greater than found in water, and most often are from natural mineral deposits and mining operations, 

oh... and your linked article right there? #30, which you have referenced multiple times across this post? 

https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/en/l-2/3.htm#0

here is a basic text summery for you... 

in case you dont want to read it, let me quote a few things for you

in regards to fluorosis in permanent teeth

&gt;However, the EFSA panel considered that an intake of less than 0.1 mg of fluoride per kilogram of body weight, per day, led to no significant incidence of ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù fluorosis in permanent teeth.

&gt;Fluorosis can occur in areas with fluoridated water, and also in those without. Fluoride supplements and use of fluoridated toothpaste, in large amounts, also increase the risk.

in regards to skeletal fluorosis

&gt;SCHER concludes that there is not enough data to evaluate the risk of bone fracture at the fluoride levels seen in areas with fluoridated water.

and in regards to cancer

&gt;On reviewing the most recent studies, the SCHER concludes that epidemiological work does not indicate a clear link between fluoride in drinking water and any cancers. Nor is there evidence from animal studies to support such a link. Fluoride should therefore be classified as non-carcinogenic.

in regards to Neuro Effects

&gt;The SCHER concludes that there is no clear evidence that fluoride in drinking water at concentrations permitted in the EU may reduce children‚Äôs IQ, and that there is no biological basis for thinking that this would occur.

in regards to reproduction

&gt;A few human studies have suggested that fluoride might affect reproductive hormones, but they are poorly designed for risk evaluation. SCHER concludes that fluoride in drinking water at concentrations permitted in the EU has no reproductive effects.

so... what else ya got?
