If you don't have these constraints, you just wait around for good deals to pop up before booking.

Similarly, travel is pretty damn cheap if you don't mind taking a 5am flight to a random rural airport, taking a 3 hour bus to another airport, waiting 12 hours in the airport, then taking a 1am flight to another rural airport, then taking another bus to your final destination.

It's somewhat a political issue as well.

In the prototype Twingo, three battery packs are fitted in front and two in what used to be the gas tank. The whole pack, bought from a Tesla Inc. parts reseller, weighs 120 kilograms (265 pounds). To compare, Renault's electric Zoe has a 290 kilogram battery for a 210 kilometer driving range. Prices start at around 23,000 euros excluding battery rental battery. The transition takes less than a day, leaving the original stick shift and gear box and installing the plug behind the hatch that drivers usually pop open to refill the tank. Founder Aymeric Libeau, whose previous experiences include co-founding software company Pentalog Group, has worked on retrofitting for two years, and tested the method with a French business school. He is looking to raise 6 million euros to build a factory he says would be capable of churning out as many as 4,000 vehicles next year.

The best way for us to help you is if you told us what your goals are for your language, orthography, romanization, etc. Here are some things to consider:

* Are you going for a certain aesthetic? For example, do you want your language to be reminiscent of French? Japanese? Sumerian?

* Related to aesthetic, do you have a preference for digraphs? Diacritics? Uncommon symbols like yogh ⟨ȝ⟩?

* Do you want your orthography/romanization to be intuitive for English speakers to read? Do you want it to be systematic (e.g., one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes)? Or do you want your orthography to have historical spellings and irregularities (e.g., English [naɪt] being spelled *knight*, alluding to when it used to be pronounced something like [kniːçt] a thousand years ago).

With all that in mind, here is what I came up with for your language. I got rid of your trigraphs, and went with something a little more intuitive for monolingual English speakers to read. Like u/storkstalkstock already said, your proto and daughter languages don't have to have the same orthography/romanization, so I went ahead and used ⟨b d g⟩ for the unaspirated plosive series and ⟨p t k⟩ for the aspirated series.

|**Lateral**||l|ʎ ⟨lj⟩||||

Your vowels were harder to do. I like your use of umlauts for central vowels, like in the IPA. I took inspiration from Korean [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean) for the unrounded back vowels; I also looked to French orthography for the open-mid vowels. The open vowels (and you really have way too many if you're trying to go for naturalism), were really hard to do, but hopefully the system I have is intuitive.

we follow your logic lad. So be it. From the ""arbitrary"" 12/13 to 16/17 timescale Juve alone did better than all English teams together.

Yes, but almost every other time period you choose shows the opposite of the point you're trying to prove. If you pick the last five games before Christmas in the PL you can show that Man City were in fact the 11th best team, Spurs were going to win the league and West Ham were going to come third. Who knew eh?

&gt;Aye, 2 finals is definitely and not just ""marginally"" better than 2 semis, and it shows that they were a bigger fish than any English team in all those years 

No, it shows England were in a downswing in that period while Germany and especially Spain were tearing it up. Let's also not forget in one of those finals Juve got trashed 4-1

&gt;and not that the Serie A just was weaker. If for you that doesn't mean nothing, I couldn't care less.  

It shows nothing whatsoever about the strength of the Serie A. Only Juve.

If you want to look at three strength of Serie A as a whole why not look at the fact in that time period Italian clubs not called Juve only reached the knockouts of the CL 4 times in five years, getting knocked out in the round of 16 every time AND Juve won every league title with a cumulative points gap over the second place team of 56 points (11.2 points per season) AND won three out of five Copa Italias. But the Serie had loads of strong teams in that time period, right?



&gt;no lad, 4 years ago *is* more time than 2 months ago, that isn't me trying to distort something, is just the reality. How is that related to ""English European performances"" when we are comparing the chances of not top teams in their respective leagues of winning something escapes my imagination.  

Yes, lad, I understand how time works. You'll also notice, lad, how choosing one season where Juve didn't win doesn't erase 7 years of total domination by Juventus of both the Serie A and the Copa Italia, lad. 


&gt;again, Leicester was great, but in the overall state of things isn't truly meaningful. 

It's meaningful in that it clearly shows the opposite of your claim that underdogs can't do well in the PL. 

&gt;Kaiserslautern and Deportivo did similar things and 20 years after, and in a easier context it hasn't repeated. You can't just obviate that.  


And you can't obviate the fact that it happened. Note also that before people would have said it was impossible for that to happen and yet here we are



&gt;and yet the league who last season had a single team winning every domestic competition wasn't the Italian

For literally the first time **ever**. Just ignore that though, doesn't fit your narrative. You'll also have to ignore yet another inconvenient fact that the league Fa Cup double has only been done three times in the 21st century whereas Juve have done it four times in the last five years. 


&gt;and *you* seem to ignore that. Your people can be completely deluded to think that City didn't already started to be what Juve has been domestically at least until Pep leaves, from outside it seems to be pretty obvious and it is funny how you still insist in using the ""league different winners"" logic to prove something even after last season.  

They won last year by a single point ffs. Yes while Pep is there City are always going to be favourites but soon enough he will get bored and leave. Also it's by no means a given they win again this year. It's notoriously hard to string together PL titles. The longest run of consecutive league titles in the entire history of the English first Division going back to 1889 is three in a row that's only happened four times in 130 years. Compare that to the Serie A where you have a run of **8** Juve title wins (I actually fucked up before and undersold how ridiculously one-sided it is) preceded by a run of five Inter wins on the bounce with a Milan win sandwiched in the middle



&gt;Lazio is winning the Coppa, Atalanta reaching the final and getting CL football, Wolves is finishing 7th. Everybody have chances of anything, but the difference between them are immense.  

The difference between them is next to nothing. Wolves were less than a minute from an FA Cup final last season. It's also funny you bring up Atalanta since the parallels between them and Wolves are actually very obvious. A team that for most of their history have been in-between the first and second division (in fact Wolves have more pedigree) now making a push up the table with a new, more ambitious goal



&gt;If you think that a player should value more finishing 7th in the PL just because it is the PL instead of winning a domestic Cup and getting CL football in a top league, mate, *you* are the biased delusional.  

Jesus Christ are you being deliberately dense. There are so many more factors than this pointless binary choice you're laying out. Is the player going to play or be benched? Is the coach good? Are the club on the up? Is the club playing in a competitive environment? How much is the wage? Is the style of play right? All these are questions that should be asked ahead of ""what chance is there of winning a domestic cup"", given how random and sporadic those things are. The only way of guaranteeing a chance at cup success is to join the very best team


&gt;&gt;They're a slightly bigger team in a smaller pond. Wolves are absolutely on the up too  
&gt;  
&gt;Wolves are the top of what?


I didn't say anything about Wolves being the top of anything. Wtf are you jabbering on about now?

&gt;Burnley did the same than then the season before and then they weren't able to even reach the EL groups stage. That's their kind of level, not anything else. Ah, but let me guess, here comes the verbiage about how because of completely arbitrary reasons and biased reasoning both cases aren't comparable and Wolves is in fact of the same tier than a team that wins Cups and goes far in the EL.  

Oh, right I see. It's not an act. You really are that dumb. It's so painfully obvious you don't watch either Wolves or Burnley. The differences are so unbelievably obvious to anyone that has actually watched them. If you want objective stats, Burnley massively overperformed their expected points (by 13 points) and while they were very impressive to finish 7th, they ""should"" have finished 14th, and before you tell me Burnley always overperform in expected points, they actually underpoerformed by two points last season and only overperformed by 1.6 points in 16/18. Wolves on the other hand underpoerformed last season and finished 6th in the expected points table. In other words Burnley were always going to drop off whereas Wolves are likely to push on. 




&gt;A player has more chances of winning something in a Lazio kind of team than in a not-top 6 English team.

For the umpteenth time, players should not be choosing clubs on the off chance of winning a domestic cup because they happen so sporadically unless you're a very big team. Even if that was a sensible criteria England is still the better bet becsuse you've also got the chance of winning the League Cup


&gt;Lazio is bigger both historically and presently than Wolves. 

Not really though, it's pretty tit for tat, Wolves have won more league titles, Lazio have won more domestic cups and have a European trophy, but then Wolves have reached the final of the same competition and get bigger attendances nowadays (despite a much smaller stadium.


&gt;Finishing 7th in the PL is definitely far less impressive than winning domestic cups 

Winning domestic cups is like the icing on the cake of a season. If you have a shit cake icing it doesn't make it less shit. For example is Wigan winning the Fa Cup and getting related in the same season more impressive than finishing 7th in the league? No clearly not

&gt;or getting CL football in other top leagues. 

Something Lazio have done once since 06/07 and even then they lost the playoff and played in the Europa League anyway.

If you're talking more generally, there are very few clubs if any in top leagues that regularly get CL football where Cutrone would play more than he is likely to at Wolves so they are poor choices

&gt;Juve from 12/13 to the rise of Liverpool and Man City was a bigger fish than any English team as the international performances prove.  

Ok great. So what? In a very specific time period Juve was slightly stronger than the top English teams but Serie A was still far less competitive as a whole as evidenced by the lack of success from every other team. Also in every recent time period before or since England was stronger


&gt;if highlighting how absurd the situation is becoming because of the financial disparity between leagues, with minions like Wolves or Fullham spending more than CL clubs, so be it, I have such chip. I'm sorry for not just praising you while you destroy the rest of football, but ask yourself, wouldn't you do the same if you were in our position and not in the privileged one?

You're also just ignoring the silly spending that goes on in Italy (mainly Juve), by PSG, and in Spain by the big clubs.

Since before her birth, Bogdana Cometopoulos, was destined for greatness. Fate would see her rise to become Bogdana the Hammer, Empress of Bulgaria and Shield of Christendom, and lose it all in the name of love. 

So basically, playing as her grandfather, I got two duchies in Byzantium through a war with Byz. The firstborn son was supposed to inherit, however after two failed marriages and five other children, I got a genius son, younger by about 10 years. Of course, I had to get the genius elected, but I felt really bad for the first son, as I had promised him those lands even going into the war (kind of an internal Mufasa ""all lands under the sun"" kinda deal). So after my genius inherited I made sure to keep an eye out for that guy's kids, and I promised myself I would give them all the duchies I conquer from the other Bulgarian dukes when I eventually usurp the kingdom, and I eventually do so.

Enter the tragic story of Bogdana and Gergana. Gergana was the child of that firstborn son I mentioned earlier, matrilinearly married to a younger, attractive rando and was given a duchy of her own, bordering my demesne (duchies around Constantinople and Thessaloniki were mine), as per the promise. She had already had several children, and was nearing old age as Bogdana ascended to the throne of Bulgaria. Bogdana was the youngest of her siblings, but was born a child of destiny, so she had to inherit. Both of them became great friends, and I gave Gergana another duchy after a cute flavor event happened between them. But this is where things turn sour. As Bogdana went on a rampage through Europe, slaughtering the pagans and infidels (she was Catholic, wanted to try new crusades in Holy Fury) and earning her the moniker of Bogdana the Hammer, she grew lonely and found solace in the arms of Gergana's husband, who himself grew tired of his now old and infertile wife.

Now here is where things get fucked up. Gergana finds out about the affair and promptly proceeds to go apeshit. They become bitter rivals, and Gergana starts conquering every other vassal in the kingdom (mostly her own brothers/nephews) and fucking up my nice meticulously laid out setup. As I'm busy crusading for Jerusalem, I don't even notice her gaining so much power, until I return to find she has basically given all the shit she conquered to her one unlanded son. Bogdana herself has only three kids, one of whom dies of smallpox, and the other die under suspicious circumstances. Gergana, now nearing 60, challenges Bogdana, in her thirties, with 26 martial skill, a skilled duelist, to a duel. The decrepit bitch with a personal combat skill of exactly 0 actually kills my goddamn child of destiny. I have no children of my own left at this point, as I was too busy conquering and had no time for pregnancy. Her son was the most powerful Duke in the kingdom, and was easily elected Emperor of Bulgaria. I wasn't even mad, that was some next level shit.

https://www.reuters.com/article/r-bosch-batteries/update-2-bosch-shuns-battery-cell-production-in-blow-to-europe-idUSL8N1QI56P

Incidentally, I can guess without knowing anything about Germany that CATL's German gigafactory will be in a former area of East Germany.  Think about why.

&gt; Bosch had said it would only consider making battery cells if there was a chance it could capture a fifth of that market by 2030, a move it said would require about 20 billion euros ($24 billion) of investment to create 200 gigawatt hours of capacity ...

&gt; The company said it was therefore halting its research into cell technologies which had cost it in the region of 500 million euros, and dissolved the Lithium Energy and Power GmbH &amp; Co. KG (LEAP) joint venture for lithium-ion technology.

&gt; Bosch also plans to sell U.S. start-up Seeo Inc. which it bought in 2015 to enhance its expertise in next-generation lithium-ion batteries ...

Meanwhile there is a claim that to get support as one of China's champions, it was required that CATL first get rid of any foreign investment:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-batteries-idUSKBN14E0K1

&gt; To become a Chinese champion, a battery maker must first shed any foreign investment to be eligible for subsidies and other policy support, people in the industry say.

Also in China, Japanese and Korean companies were doing well at selling batters in China.   Until:

https://roskill.com/news/batteries-whats-driving-the-momentum-of-catl/

&gt; Based on their mature ternary lithium-ion battery technologies, Japanese and Korean battery makers entered the Chinese market with a cost advantage in 2015. Prices for ternary lithium-ion batteries were as low as RMB1/Wh (US$0.16/Wh). As a result, Japanese and Korean battery makers won many orders from mainstream carmakers. Until 2016, **China released a “white list” of qualified vehicles that were eligible for subsidies, which effectively eliminated competition from Japanese and Korean battery makers. CATL has since become the largest beneficiary of these subsidies**.

Pictures of Whaling Scenes.

&gt;But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon
the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not
draw so good a one.

&gt;**In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian
cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the
small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the
Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while
the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in
admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the
drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of
a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily
hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.**

&gt;Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for
painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder
fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of
France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the
successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea
battle-pieces of Garnery.",True,False,False,,0,1564627932,,False,0,{},evnmtfq,False,t3_ckdafw,False,True,t3_ckdafw,/r/mobydick/comments/ckdafw/can_anyone_remember_the_passage_about_this/evnmtfq/,False,,1573380291,2,True,[],False,mobydick,t5_2vqmx,r/mobydick,public,0,

When it became clear that the West was too impotent to act (and likely just wanted the Germans to wipe out communism first), Soviet policy was forced to change from containment to proactive defense. For the next two years after WW2 began, the Soviet Union began creating a large militarized border that would hopefully either dissuade or slow down a German invasion.

&gt;and which lead to both countries invading Poland. Russia also invaded Finland and the Baltic States, as agreed upon in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

Have you ever considered that these nations were the main points of entry into the Soviet Union during *Operation Barbarossa*? This was a move necessary to slow or prevent a German invasion.

If you're looking at stuff on the side, there will always be cinema. For all I said at the start I have zero fear that artful cinema will go away. I'm skeptical about wide-release stuff - like I doubt there will be another *2001 A Space Odessey* in theatres any time soon - but single screen and arthouse theatres will always have their place.

And if you want to see weird movies with a voice, there's a special place in my heart for Bruce LaBruce - the punk Canuxploitation arthouse sociopolitical gay porno auteur. That sounds ridiculous but seriously someone yelling Marx quotes while getting fucked in an elevator was just... art. If you're into the kinds of movies that Jay loves and Mike hates, that is. Weirdo cinematographers will always be out there. There will always be Lynches and Waters' and Cronenburgs, but just like them the future ones will only be featured on a limited number of screens. I'm not worried about cinema and art going away, but I am worried about the dumbing down of society and how these films don't sneak in anymore. It wasn't the urban fantasy / magical realism of *Les Revenants* that appealed to me btw... it was that old French cinema style of patient, slow, careful story-telling. They were in no rush, but it was never boring, and the camera occasionally made it clear that you were a voyeur on these lives. It was just as much about how the show was put together from a technical standpoint as it was the story itself and the characters and how they were portrayed.

I actually have seen *Beau Séjour* and *Dark*, both before they hit Netflix as I keep an eye on the internationals (and on that note *Please Like Me* should be more watched than it was). In terms of slow, artful pacing and that European sensibility the online series *The Outs* wowed me with its pacing and its absolute refusal to engage in any exposition. It was basically a whodunnit about two exes where you reconstruct from basically eavesdropping what happened between them (and later you find out exactly how you're wrong). The thing that wowed me the most about *The Outs* was it felt European but was made in NYC.

Faço uso de antidepressivos há uns 3 anos mais ou menos. Sim, no começo é complicado o ajuste da dose, e quando você melhorar o desmame é bem gradativo (você não pode simplesmente parar de tomar).

Vá ao psiquiatra, continue fazendo terapia e não deixe de tomar seus remédios, nem um dia sequer. Você vai ver como vai se sentir melhor em pouco tempo. No meu caso, senti bem a diferença, e quem convive comigo também.

Não fique nessa noia de “ah vou viciar, vou ficar dependente”. Você já tá mal, o remédio é um caminho para você melhorar. Depende do grau da depressão, da ansiedade.

Pollarding, a pruning system involving the removal of the upper branches of a tree, promotes a dense head of foliage and branches. In ancient Rome, Propertius mentioned pollarding during the 1st century BCE. The practice occurred commonly in Europe since medieval times, and takes place today in urban areas worldwide, primarily to maintain trees at a determined height.Traditionally, people pollarded trees for one of two reasons: for fodder to feed livestock or for wood. Fodder pollards produced ""pollard hay"" for livestock feed; they were pruned at intervals of two to six years so their leafy material would be most abundant. Wood pollards were pruned at longer intervals of eight to fifteen years, a pruning cycle tending to produce upright poles favored for fence rails and posts and boat construction.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me explain ....

&amp;#x200B;

Obama was primarily judged by his polices, his leadership and other peer-based criticisms as an equal over political divides and with the same historical vitriol that has been present since the very first days of our nation and in many of our presidential elections since George Washington.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite a rise of preference for collective policies/ideas during Obama's tenure among Millennials and coastal/blue-urban spot citizens, most of America still remains individualist/liberty driven.

&amp;#x200B;

The citizenship thing was never race based, we have been going back and forth with each other over 'natural born citizen' for generations.

&amp;#x200B;

In Obama's case most of it was due his communist upbringing. Communist were notorious liars/scam artist back in the day to get benefits and live off the state. This was increased by the sealing of his records and a book in which the literary agent claimed he was from Kenya too.  Andy Martin is credited with being the founder of birtherism surrounding Obama.

&amp;#x200B;

Another person who has faced similar scrutiny is Tea Party favorite  Senator Ted Cruz who also has his records sealed so that no one can verify if his mother filed the paperwork required at the time to be a citizen vs gaining citizenship through amnesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also in 2008 when McCain ran against Obama, there were questions as to whether he should be seen as a natural born citizen having been born on a US base in Panama

&amp;#x200B;

For 2020 our 'birther natural born-citizen' candidate is Tulsi Gabbard who was born in American Samoa to American parents.

&amp;#x200B;

No our nation isn't founded upon racism, regions vary in their social evolution, the more assimilated ethnic/racial/religious diversity the less anyone cares, the less ethnic/racial/religious diverse or if multicultural diverse is employed the more us/them mentality persists. This is why we embrace assimilated individualist-liberty which produces E pluribus unum  over collectivism or multiculturalism. Our incarceration rates reflect corrupt elites who enjoy profiting from the misery of others, it is easier to target and experiment on minority populations (which led to increased incarceration rates) before expanding them to the white majority. 

&amp;#x200B;

 At this time only a little over 900 children remain separated due to various reasons including derelict parent(s) or those seeking legal counsel with their parents to become UACs. 

The other factor in separation was whether a family presented themselves as a refugee legally at a port of entry and are rarely separated vs unlawful entry which was an automatic separation. We have laws, no one is above the law. Those who illegally cross into our nation put their children at risk through criminal behavior no different than a citizen who has their child present when arrested for a crime. Once a refugee made it to Mexico they were technically safe,  AmLO after all is a socialist president, has offered generous options and Mexico is set on a path of progressive revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

The largest population of children in custody are UACs (unaccompanied alien children) this number as of June for the 2019 fiscal year is 63,624. We are required by law (2008 bill sponsored by California Democratic Party Rep. Dianne Feinstein) to process these children at a much slower rate over trafficking precautions.

&gt; Tensions between the US and Iran have heightened since the US last year withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal that aimed to curb Iranian nuclear activities.

&gt; On Wednesday, the US extended waivers which allow Russia, China and European countries to continue civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran.

&gt; &amp;quot;At the same time the Iranian regime denies Iranian citizens&amp;#039; access to social media, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif spreads the regime&amp;#039;s propaganda and disinformation around the world through these mediums,&amp;quot; Mr Mnuchin said.

&gt; Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&amp;B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.

&gt; Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike ""The Man"" Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as ""The Man"" was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably ""We Care a Lot"", which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and ""We Are the World"".

&gt; The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of ""creative differences."" In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band's internal relationships had descended into ""pathological hatred"". Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the ""whipping boy"" of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.

&gt; Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group's first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

&gt; Patton's astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling—usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on ""Epic"" and the sleazy jazz vocals of ""Edge Of the World"" (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as ""a pair of lungs on legs.""

&gt; The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as ""not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic."" The video for ""Epic"", which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1).

&gt; Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is ""one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,"" and another writes that ""'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers … reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.""  Angel Dust featured the singles ""Midlife Crisis"" and ""A Small Victory"", as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic ""Easy"", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U.S., sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of ""Easy"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U.K., South America, Europe and Australia.

&gt; After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N' Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band's most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U.K., Germany and Australia. In the U.S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1.5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles ""Gentle Art Of Making Enemies"" and ""Take This Bottle"", and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of ""King For A Day."" It's been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived...Patton doesn't drive any more. Patton comments, ""Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. ...We had to look at lot of things in the face...it was nice.""

&gt; 
Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U.S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Last Cup Of Sorrow"" had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad ""Stripsearch"" was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). ""She Loves Me Not"" was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up.

&gt; On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band's growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide.

&gt; Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantômas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996).

&gt; Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks ""Falling To Pieces"" and ""The Perfect Crime"" were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey respectively.

&gt; On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009.  The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press  release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM.com. 

&gt; Th 10-song album Sol Invictus was released May 19, 2015.

This is a time period that the Hapsburgs were burning whole villages at the stake due to religion and politics. It's a level of brutality that completely fit that of the rest of Europe at the time, and instances of Hungarians fighting with Muslims against another faction of Christianity was not such a massive break from tradition or as shocking as all the weird and disturbing and non-traditional things going on all over Europe at the time. You might as well wonder why the English beheaded their king for suspected crypto-catholicism, or why in Russia people were striving for martyrdom over disagreements about how many fingers to hold up during prayer, or any or the long list of incredibly bizarre things happening in German cities during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if you mean that the Hapsburgs starting seeing Hungary differently? There were always some Hungarians on their side as well, though, as loyalists due to political rivalries with aristocrats on the independent claimant's side, or family ties to the Hapsburgs, or promise of wealth from them, or just plain catholic unity.

Ironic.

&gt;shifted focus away from the fact that slavery still exists and always had.

It's almost like it's now illegal in the majority of the world, and most English speaking nations are related to Europe is some way. Sure it's always existed in various forms, but there's only two that were on the same scale as the trans-Atlantic slave trade. And only one of those was caused by Europeans reshaping markets to provide a way for them to buy slaves.

&gt;Maybe think about the impact of your pathetic paternalism for a change.

That word, it does not mean what you think it means. Sellers only exist when there is a buyer, so if slavers exists it is the fault of the groups who buy them, this does not absolve the seller, but it also doesn't do what you are trying to do and shift blame away from people making use of slavery.

There were some scattered tribes living here before the Europeans arrived but they never set borders even around their living locations; much less around the whole territory that corresponds to the U.S., so they never took ownership of the land.

The Indians didn't have open borders; they really had NO borders at all. They didn't even know how large or small a land the area around their tribes was. They had no country and they had developed nothing in this land.

All tribes weren't even united. They fought against and killed each other all the time. Indians never claimed the whole territory of what is the U.S. today.  
If we put together all the area actually occupied by Indian tribes at that time, the total square footage of Indian-occupied land back then might be comparable to the total area designated as Indian land today throughout the U.S.

The Indians were only conquered in the sense that they were forcibly relocated, but there was at least a concern from the ""conquerors"" about recognizing that the Indians were here when the Europeans arrived and that they had the right to remain here, so land was preserved for them. 

Leftards are pathetic &amp; dumb. Explorers got here AT THE END OF THE 1400s (when the whole of the world was still unknown and still being explored &amp; settled) and found a mostly uninhabited and completely undeveloped land, and they put in the very hard work to make it into a country and bring development to it - without depending on anything the Indians had built or depending on the Indians to maintain them and their families or to make their lives better (at best they got advice from Indians on how to grow a specific crop or something like that). But leftards want to compare these brave explorers and settlers who started the path into making the U.S. into the most powerful and best country in the world to people invading an established nation that has internationally recognized borders (like every other country in the planet has had for a very long time now), not to build anything new or even to significantly contribute to what has already been built, but to take advantage of the wealth and development which they weren't able to build in their own countries and to take from the hard-working American people in the form of social benefits and/or by bringing chaos and crime.

Besides all of this, if it hadn't been the European, it would have been another people to arrive here and settle in this area, such as the Asians or worse; the Muslims - then the Indians would have been completely genocided, which the European didn't do.  There were fights in which Indians and Europeans or Americans killed each other, and many Indians died from illness, especially during the long journey (Trail of Tears) they were forced to go on towards the new area reserved for them in the west, but the White man didn't ever just put Indians against the wall and shot them for entertainment or to eliminate all Indians and ""steal"" all ""their"" land, which by the way, hadn't been theirs since humans started inhabiting the Earth.

We know there were people here before the Indians, such as the people who created and lived in the ancient city of Cahokia, which was located near what is now St. Louis and is estimated to have been vastly populated by tens of thousands of people until about 1350. 

The Indians aren't ""native"" to America either.

This stems from the primary loophole where devs **cannot delete apps** from Google Play.  All they can do is **Unpublish** - which just removes app's visibility to new viewers, while it remains visible for previous users.

Since those apps were published under previous rules, and it is Google who changes goalposts every year, it is essentially exacting **developer manpower without compensation**, and on compulsion.

The primary motivator for this, or the **source of this hidden power** for Google is their secretive (hidden rules) and much feared app ban, and subsequent developer ban (when too many app bans pile up, the dev will get banned).

Essentially, we are seeing the exercise of market dominance in action - because developers don't have recourse to another platform (once they are android specialists), and because app bans and developer bans happen in a climate of secrecy and obfuscation (we have many examples of such misbehavior by Google - defending Google because they have a difficult job with millions of apps/devs is not a burden an ordinary dev should bear - that falls directly on Google).

As a result Google leverages the nuisance factor to exact **greater compliance from devs** than Google could ordinarily exact in normal business dealings with devs.

In this way **Google's practices veer dangerously close to the practices of the Mafia**.

Unspoken rules threaten dire consequence  which are not spelled out explicitly in Google documents (or are spelled out years later as in this example) - and compliance is assured by a silent underlying threat of lifetime ban for the dev.  Given Google's all-pervasive presence now in everyone's lives, this means Google punches beyond it's reasonable weight - as a ban by Google has far wider implications than just a couple of app bans.

As it stands right now, a dev dealing with Google faces more extreme threat of action than if that dev was dealing with a smaller company.

This is an excellent reason to have a regulatory split of Google, **so Android behaves as a separate company**, instead of operating on the strategic goals of an all-encompassing search/user-tracking company that will eventually be seen as a threat - a territory that Facebook has already entered.  And which Google will eventually enter, given their history of such practices.

Google apologists will say this is a compulsion of Google's business model - they cannot be expected to deal equitably with millions of apps/devs.  Oddly such a leeway is not afforded to devs.  Google owns the business model, and benefits from it.  They should also be held accountable for it, and should not be considered too powerful that their business partners operate under an atmosphere of compulsion.

Here is some background on how the ""associated account bans"" work - a company can get banned, because their developer has a friend who got banned.  Is this the behavior of an above-board company ?

&gt; The Pretty Things are a 1960s and 1970s rock and roll band from London. They pioneered a raw approach to rhythm and blues (and later, psychedelia) that influenced a number of key bands of the 1960s British invasion, particularly The Rolling Stones, and David Bowie whose first hero was Phil May.

&gt; Pretty Things was preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. When Brian Jones joined Little Boy Blue and the Blues Boys as guitarist, Taylor was pushed from playing guitar to bass and the Rolling Stones were formed.

&gt; Several months later Dick Taylor (born Richard Clifford Taylor, 28 January 1943, in Dartford, Kent) quit the newly formed Rolling Stones to pursue his schooling when he was accepted at London Central School of Art, where he met up with Phil May (born Phillip Arthur Dennis Kattner, on 9 November 1944, in Dartford, Kent) and they formed Pretty Things.

&gt; Taylor was once again playing his preferred guitar with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited Brian Pendleton (born 13 April 1944 in Wolverhampton–died 16 May 2001 in Maidstone, Kent) on rhythm guitar; John Stax (born John Edward Lee Fullegar, 6 April 1944 in Crayford, Kent) on bass; and, after trying a couple of different drummers, including Pete Kitley and Viv Andrews, stuck with Viv Prince (born Vivian St John Prince, 9 August 1944, in Loughborough, Leices).

&gt; Early career

&gt; They caused a sensation in England, and their first three singles — ""Rosalyn"" #41, ""Don't Bring Me Down"" #10, and the self-penned ""Honey I Need"" at #13 — appeared in the UK singles chart in 1964-1965. They never had a hit in the United States, but had considerable success in their native United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands in the middle of the decade. However, in the U.S. they, along with The Yardbirds and Van Morrison's Them, were a huge influence on hundreds of garage bands, including the MC5 and The Seeds.

&gt; Their early material was hard-edged blues-rock influenced by Bo Diddley (they took their name from Diddley's 1955 song ""Pretty Thing"" in humorous contrast to their unkempt long-haired appearance) and Jimmy Reed, much like that of their contemporaries The Stones and The Yardbirds. They were known for wild ""rock and roll"" behaviour and shocking the establishment; their song ""Midnight to Six Man"" defined the mod lifestyle. Around this time, the first of what would be many personnel changes over the years also began, with Prince the first to go late in 1965. He was replaced by Skip Alan. Pendleton left late in 1966, and was not initially replaced. Then, Stax quit early in 1967 and Jon Povey and Wally Waller joined to make the band a five piece once again.

&gt; After an uncomfortable flirtation with mainstream pop on the Emotions album in 1967, they embraced psychedelia, producing the groundbreaking concept album S.F. Sorrow during 1967-68. This album, released in late 1968, is arguably one of the first rock operas, preceding The Who's Tommy by about a year. It was recorded in the legendary Abbey Road Studios six months after The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Each album shares a similar forward-thinking late-1960s psychedelic sound (as well as sharing the same record producer, Norman Smith, as the Floyd). S.F. Sorrow was followed by the highly-acclaimed record album Parachute, which continued the psychedelic sound and was named ""Album of the Year"" in 1970 by Rolling Stone Magazine. During this period they also recorded an album for a young French millionaire, Philippe DeBarge, which was intended only to be circulated among the man's social circle. The acetate has since been bootlegged.

&gt; Later career

&gt; From this point on, the group enjoyed less in the way of commercial success, but the devotion of a strong cult following, especially with critics and other rock musicians. Their material in the early 1970s tended towards more the hard rock and early heavy metal end of the spectrum, although still blues-based, on albums like Silk Torpedo. 1980's Cross Talk saw them incorporating influences of punk and New Wave into their hard rock sound; like most of their records, it was an artistic but not a commercial success.

&gt; With a new manager, Mark St John, they gigged sporadically during the 1980s. By the end of the decade their profile had almost disappeared, when founder members Phil May and Dick Taylor reformed the band for a successful European blues tour in late 1990 with Stan Webb's Chicken Shack and Luther Allison. This gigging outfit included drummer Hans Waterman (formerly of Dutch rock group Solution), bassist Roelf ter Velt and guitarist/keyboardist Barkley McKay (Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonaut's with Jon Langford of Mekon Fame). This line up regularly toured the European mainland playing a revitalised set that show cased their earlier, rootsy blues and r'n'b materiel, until late 1994. By 1995, they reformed the Cross Talk line-up and added Frank Holland on guitar in place of Peter Tolson. Their label, Snapper Music, issued remastered CDs with many bonus tracks, plus a DVD of a re-recording of S.F. Sorrow at Abbey Road Studios (with Dave Gilmour &amp; Arthur Brown guesting). They toured more frequently, including a tour of the U.S. for the first time in decades

&gt; Original rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton died of lung cancer on May 16, 2001.

&gt; In the early 2000's, they released new recordings, including a live album and the studio album Rage Before Beauty.

&gt; In 2003, Alan Lakey's biography of the band, Growing Old Disgracefully, was published by Firefly. The book dealt with the long and involved history of the band, and paid special attention to the legal proceedings issued against EMI in the 1990s.

To elaborate:    
Experts at UK in a Changing Europe [told us](https://fullfact.org/europe/no-deal-divorce-bill-legally-obligated-pay/) in February that, under international law, it’s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice. The European Commission [has said](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-743_en.htm) that in a no deal scenario, it would still expect the UK to “honour all commitments made during EU membership”. 

So yes, I think the UK will still pay money to the EU if only to smooth over any future deal, as I said, a divorce between nations does not mean that all obligations stop as well.

Because you wrote about how industrial society = post-industrial society. pre-industrial = primary. industrial = secondary. post-industrial = tertiary. That is how modern economies evolve..?

We both agree early stage capitalism is good, where ownership is widely distributed, it's mostly meritocratic etc. That's why I want to recreate a similar society where everyone can get what they deserve and earn through meritocracy rather than having this borderless, debt ridden, consumer hellhole with no purpose where people are reduced to homo economicus by both sets of materialists (marxists and capitalists). I seek to give people back their sovereignty and purpose in life, the ONLY way to do that is to rein in the corporations, which libertarian policies do NOT do.

I also would put major limitations on unproductive economic activity, this includes usury, speculation and other forms of profiteering which don't involve the profiteer providing anything useful.

&gt;Ah, but China and Russia and Africa and India etc. never really could catch up, could they? The irony that our economic competitors after WWII were Germany and Japan, two nations subject to increased capitalism even as America's capitalist system was receding! We imposed a freedom on both that made them the second and third most productive economies by the 1980s!

Alright cool, so the GDP increased, is that all that matters? What good is a high GDP if the average man's relative wealth decreases? All it means is that the rich are getting richer, while the 99.99% are getting poorer. No one is claiming that a command economy increases GDP more than a market economy. Although with the advancements in technology today I'm sure the government could monitor markets just as well as capitalists do. We have controlled economies now, most of the differences in GDP and such are due to Finance IE speculation. The trading of stocks, bonds, currencies etc. None of these things are physical, they are abstract and speculative, therefore it is possible for economic agents to manipulate markets quite easily. For example after Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't ban holocaust deniers from facebook their stocks plummeted the next day, what does that tell you? Rich speculators want holocaust denial banned from facebook of course, perhaps because they are Jewish and it offends them or whatever. I'm sure you'll say it's grassroots and millions of regular joes traded in their stocks because they heard the BIG NEWS from Zuck and thought facebook was going to implode after such a catastrophic horrible PR move, lol.

I would also say that I think the brilliance of Western Europeans far outweights all the others you mentioned. If you've ever read 'Human Accomplishment' by Charles Murray, you'll know that 97% of all innovations and advancements in literally every major field have come from Western Europeans. Mostly from Britain, Germany, France and Italy.

&gt;Ah, but ""what does it matter?"" It matters because the relevant distinction for all of this is political and economic freedom!

I don't doubt that 'economic freedom' increases GDP. I just doubt that increases in GDP increases wellbeing for the ordinary man, the evidence over the past 50 years tells us otherwise. You need the government to put restraints on the power of the rich otherwise they will keep enriching themselves at the cost of everyone else. It's pretty simple:

- Inflation is let's say 2% per year

- Businesses' profit must outpace inflation and increase the margin to please shareholders

This means businesses increase profit margin by

- Improvements in technology, efficiency of workers etc

- Importing new workers to replace your current ones for less wages

[Wages have stagnated whilst inflation has continued, this means in real terms wages have depreciated.](https://imgur.com/a/l1cwMLy), property, healthcare, education etc have all increased in price at a much quicker rate than inflation too. America's productivity is constantly increasing but the average man is constantly getting poorer. What libertarian policies change this? There are none, libertarian policies are geared towards increasing GDP which doesn't matter whatsoever to the 99.99%. Why the fuck would I care how George Soros, the Koch Brothers, the Sacklers etc are doing on the stock markets? I care about how much my wages that never increase in value are worth, I'm working harder and producing more yet I'm earning less? Why? Sure you can look down your nose on me because you're so much smarter than me for googling a Socrates quote and scoff because I'm just not an intellectual powerhouse like you that can pick up valuable skills and whatnot. But how does that help the average Joe keep his kids fed? Just 10 years ago his minimum wage job was fine when the kids were babies but now his wages are worth 20% less in real terms even though he's earning his business way more money. What do you tell him? It's his own fault for not somehow magically beating a rigged system right? Really meritocratic.

&gt;You can't even entertain this idea because you have such a biased narrative against capitalism, and such confusion about what capitalism is and is not, that you insist on one set of cause-and-effect. You insist on your narrative even when I try to confront you with a historical reality that directly contradicts it.

This again, how many times have I asked you to define and/or explain your terms? You have refused to explain literally anything. You refuse to engage with reality even.

&gt;Trying to open your mind to any other possibility is a fool's errand, and my attempt here has only resulted in you insisting I haven't explained ""anything"" or ""backed up a single point."" There is no explaining anything to someone with your kind of childish dogmatism.

Go on and explain how removing the government from the equation will increase the wages of the average man. The businesses will keep importing cheap labour, they'll keep outsourcing, they'll keep not increasing wages, they'll keep subverting any attempts at unionising etc ad infinitum. How exactly will saving them the money they use to bribe politicians help anything? The conditions will be the exact same.

The reason why some bills forbid private insurance is because M4A will include pretty much all essential benefits, which is something that Germany and Canada don't do for example. in these countries, people buy private insurance if they want access to these benefits.

The EU declares war in response. The Secretary of Defense resigns.

The UK tries to debate its way out of joining the war (""but we're almost out anyway"") until Trump decides to bomb Jersey, believing it to be part of Spain. Brexit is canceled so the UK can focus on demonstrating the virtues of the Royal Navy to the Americans. The new Secretary of Defense resigns.

The Democrats try to remove Donald Trump from office on grounds of being utterly insane but are blocked by the Republicans on grounds of ""it was a Democrat idea so we we'll oppose it on principle"". The new Secretary of Defense resigns.

Meanwhile, Germany switches to a war economy to equip and mobilize its troops, promising to make at least ten ships and up to fifteen tanks available within the next five years. Ammunition for the ships and tanks is expected to be available by mid-2030.

America tries to get its various allies around the Middle East to join the war but quickly find its doesn't actually have any after a pre-emptive bombing run is made on Golan instead of Iran, killing Israeli troops and causing Israel to angrily declare neutrality in the war. Five hours into his tenure the new Secretary of Defense accepts full responsibility and resigns. Saudi Arabia declines to comment; rumors from sources close to Salman ibn Abd al-Aziz say it's because ""he just couldn't stop laughing"".

After tweeting that he'd launch nukes to ""Kill all the Hitlers in Europe! #MAGA"" Trump attempts to authorize the deployment of the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States against the city of Malmö, Sweden, but is stopped because Europe hasn't actually gone on the offense and he thus needs the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Due to new Secretaries of Defense resigning within minutes of being nominated the office is currently incapable of approving anything.

Ordered to ""do everything to shut off the European gas"", American commando units destroy large parts of Gazprom's infrastructure. Angrily, Russia declares war on the USA. Several high-ranking American generals resign, leaving the military leadership in disarray.

Russia's only aircraft carrier suddenly takes on water and sinks, crippling Russia's ability to participate in the war. In a bid to save face Russia relegates itself to cyberwar, with the most successful campaign being a concerted Twitter trolling effort against the American president.

The Democrats are officially considering using assassins to remove Trump from office. The Republicans counter by showing up in explosive vests, promising to suicide bomb both the Senate and the House if Trump is killed. Control of the American military has been delegated to the Interim Command Sergeant Major of the Army Reserve, being the highest-ranking member of the military left. He is considering resignation.

Germany pushes back the timeline on its war readiness as it turns out that the diesel engines on both the tanks and the ships fail current emission standards due to defeat devices being present during certification. However, the Bundeswehr can now supply up to 500 fully armed soldiers, provided none of them needs to go through more than two magazines.

The Royal Navy returns from an attack on the USA. Due to lack of planning the ships had actually departed without any ammunition; however, in an accidental collision with a boat of the United States Coast Guard the Navy technically inflicted more damage than it received and thus the Tories sell the excursion as ""a rousing success"". When Trump demands to know where the US Navy was he is told that all ship captains had already resigned, leaving the ships unable to leave port.

Jared Kushner is instated as captain of the USS Nimitz. Within a week he manages to run it ashore on Liberty Island. He attempts to fire his entire crew, only to be told that ""discharge doesn't work that way"". The crew resigns nonetheless.

Donald Trump passes an executive order to confiscate all guns in America to equip the US Army because ""they'd be more effective if they had more guns"". The Republicans immediately move to impeach him. The Democrats oppose on grounds of ""it was a Republican idea so we we'll oppose it on principle"" but relent when the Republicans offer to legalize cannabis for incarcerated Americans in return for cooperation.

After the fastest impeachment process in history Donald Trump is convicted of five dozen charges and kicked out of the White House. The USA and the EU agree to a peaceful settlement, not mentioning once that both belligerents are unable to continue the war – the USA because they have no soldiers left in service and the EU because Italy has somehow managed to ""misplace"" the entire European war fund.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated calls for easier monetary policy may not be what drove the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday. 

&gt; But Trump’s policies did set the table for it. 

&gt; His aggressive tactics on trade, including 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods that prompted retaliatory duties on U.S. exports, have made companies uncertain about the future and more hesitant to invest. 

&gt; The Fed’s beige book, a collection of economic anecdotes from around the country, now regularly features an escalating and eclectic collection of trade-related impacts. 

&gt; In the edition circulated ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, a company in the Northeast complaining about the cost of keeping track of tariffs and a West Virginia rubber manufacturer saying trade wars had hurt demand from Chinese customers were among dozens of examples. 

&gt; The impact is in the hard data as well. A report last week showing the U.S. economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the second quarter featured the first drop in business investment since 2016, and trade overall was a net drag on growth. 

&gt; And it is one factor in the global manufacturing chill, exacerbating weakness from longstanding factors like aging demographics in Europe and Japan. 

&gt; Trade uncertainty, weak business investment, and sluggish growth abroad were the three main reasons cited by Fed Chair Jerome Powell for cutting rates on Wednesday to between 2.00% and 2.25%. 

&gt; “The trade war has been disruptive to the global economy and it’s created a feedback loop” that poses a risk to U.S. growth, said Eric Winograd, Senior U.S. Economist at AllianceBernstein. 

&gt; Fed policymakers “are responding primarily to risks, and most of the risks to which they are responding are coming out of the administration.” 

&gt; At the same time, Winograd said, there’s nothing usual about White House policies impacting the economy. Tax cuts by George W. Bush, tax hikes under George H. W. Bush, and government spending under Barack Obama are among examples under prior presidents, he said. 

&gt; Some risks to which the Fed’s rate cut is meant to respond are not of Trump’s making. 

&gt; Chief among these is low inflation, which Powell also said was a factor in the Fed’s rate cut decision in remarks to reporters on Wednesday afternoon following the committee’s action. Slow rising prices predate Trump’s tenure by years and is at least in part driven by global competition and technological innovation. Trade tariffs if anything tend to raise prices, at least temporarily. 

&gt; And while Trump’s tax cuts last year triggered faster-than-expected growth in the economy, sparking concern from some Fed officials about a slowdown once the tax break boost waned, consumer spending has stayed strong, surging at a 4.3% annual rate in the second quarter. 

&gt; Still, the Fed’s rate cut is at least in part a response to Trump’s actions, if not to his words. 

&gt; But the president wants more, and after Powell’s press conference on Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to voice displeasure with his hand-picked Fed chief’s signal that the central bank was not embarking on a full-blown rate-cutting cycle. 

&gt; “What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China, The European Union and other countries around the world,” Trump tweeted. 

&gt; “As usual, Powell let us down, but at least he is ending quantitative tightening, which shouldn’t have started in the first place,” Trump added in reference to the reduction in the Fed’s vast bond holdings over the past two years. The Fed also called an early halt to that on Wednesday. 

&gt; Powell, for his part, again insisted he and his colleagues do not take politics into account in deciding on rate policy, nor do they conduct policy to demonstrate their independence. 

&gt; “Trump has obviously attempted to influence the Federal Reserve to further his agenda,” said Nick Maroutsos, Co-Head of Global Bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. And as the 2020 presidential race heats up, he is unlikely to stop. “Trump wants lower rates, to keep down the dollar – a lower dollar - and all of that will help his campaign.”

I can't understand if you are sarcastic or real.

1. There are things that Germans do, and there are things that German don't do. And even more importantly there things that we do in the West and there are things we don't do . This argument of yours is really one of the most idiotic things I've heard ""German culture/way of life is not real"".
2. Migrants ( legal or not, since I was talking mainly about legal ones and you made the distinction), should always follow the rules in the country they are in. For example right now I'm in Germany, there are things here that I would do differently in Greece, but I'm doing them in way that I can respect the German mindset and way of living.
3. There is always should be a way to opt out. You don't want pork, great here it is something else. Don't want cow, great, here it is something else. We need to respect the people who come to our countries. But that doesn't mean we need to change the way we do things. If they don't like them, why they came here in the first place?
4. You can always feel like home at your house. It is your sanctuary, your property, they place you live. You can do things there, as far as they are legal of course.

We need respect from both parties. But ""we"" as the welcoming countries we need to be both tolerant and open minded to differences BUT by not changing our mindsets, the day we do things etc.

For example, if Muslims (and I'm using this group because it serves the example) who live in a country inside the EU, DON'T want native women to go around without hearing burka or hijab, we should never accept that. This is idiotic and offensive to freedom of expression IN OUR COUNTRY.

Another example, let's say that a given migrant group lives in one of the countries of the Union, and this group has certain beliefs about the role of woman in society, and they objectify them, attack them etc. this  should not be tolerable in our societies.

You said unless the UK wants to give everyone free trade, there would be need to a hard border. I have shown this to be incorrect. 

3rd time lucky on this question - the '10 to 1' where you say Article 24 cannot be used or that WTO quotas cannot be used (quotas and A24 being the loophole, which I have displayed). 

You make a statement, I say prove it. You don't. 
I make a statement, you say prove it. I do. 

Do you see a difference there? One of us (myself) seems to prefer factual evidence while the other (you) seems to prefer unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence.   

&gt; Nice strawmanning. Now do it for the other 39 trade agreements. See where the math leads you.

You saying I am strawmanning while actually sticking to the topic of trade is a strawman in itself. But alas, that seems to be the Reddit comeback when there is no answer - strawman. Really I don't think many people have actually read what it is, at least I don't think you have as you incorrectly used it.

Some kind of WA - I would agree with you. The current one I would say it doesn't as it's been refused by Parliament, the current Government and disliked by the public. By having a WA that wouldn't necessarily mean the UK has access to previous trade deals, in fact, it shouldn't. The UK would be aiming to forge it's own trade deals not use previous ones.

Europeans and the French particularly take butter very seriously. The feel and taste of a well salted, cultured French butter is wonderful. It has a silky texture, has a much higher fat content, well salted, and tastes almost earthy. As if you can taste what the cattle were feeding on that season the milk was taken. 

Le Beurre Bordier was my favorite and turns out, it’s world renown and highly sought after. You can watch videos on their amazing obsessions with hand making butter. I have been searching and searching since I came home to try and find it here but no luck yet.

Long story short, the wegmans French butter is an imported, French cultured butter and it is definitely one of the best butters I’ve been able to find here that reminds me of the butters I had everywhere in France.

1) Pay a layer for consultation. The 200$ I paid were the BEST decision I did! You can ask heaps of questions, but a good layer might now a MUCH better solution for your specific case. Do this ASAP. It saved my situation.

2) Make sure to comply ALL the conditions of a visa before applying. If you are unsure PAY A LAWYER. If the visa is denied it makes it VERY difficult to apply visas later, don't take this risk.

3) People from Europe and US sometimes don't realize how serious is immigration as they never need visas. I have friends that took lightly and they messed up, had to leave the country and significant others behind. So 6 months will be nothing if you get a 2 year ban.

so we are entering a time period when the united states is simultaneously the only country with the power to keep the world order  intact.....and the least interested in doing so

the result? a transactional arrangement where other nations must PAY America something we want for us to wake up and move heaven and earth. we will be more powerful than ever as the rest of the world strangles under climate change, antibiotics that no longer work, and overpopulation.......all of which will pass America by without impacting us......the American empire is going to be so ubiquitious over the next 50 years we aren't even going to need military bases",True,False,False,,0,1564666383,,False,0,{},evp5822,False,t3_ck5jfc,False,True,t1_evml99i,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ck5jfc/are_republican_claims_of_bias_in_muellers_report/evp5822/,False,,1573409283,-1,True,[],False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,0,

ftfy

&gt; It's your belief that Scotland would both have to join the euro and be unable to join euro. Which makes no more sense than anything else you've said.

Being unable to do something that is necessary is hardly a contradiction? Not sure why you think it is.

&gt; It's your belief that exports to the UK would no doubt lessen after independence, but no one except you has said that and even you haven't given any reasoning.

The reasoning should be obvious. Scotland would be a separate country, and therefore would not be able to export to the UK as freely as it does now. I'm sure you know what a border is etc.

&gt; Those aren't facts or even opinions, they're just your beliefs which are regularly shown to be true by reality.

So, no wonder so many organisations such as Oxfam, Red Cross, UN women (famous for forcefully labeling survivors as ""sex workers"". One survivor begged them to make a correction for 11 months), Amnesty International (previously, reluctant to recognize FGM, war rape as human rights violations and recognized abortion as right in 2007) and others support full decriminalisation of pimping, brothels, sex buying. Vested interest.

After a week, I've decided to replace the Mini for the LTE model - despite living in Europe and having a great amount of data at my disposal, I've spent a few days without any WiFi and it was incredibly troublesome to connect my iPads to my iPhone when needed. It almost always required me to unlock my iPhone and go to the settings for the hotspot connection to make through, and it would disconnect again if the iPad was not used after a few minutes.

About my use cases: I use the iPad Pro for gaming, browsing, Netflix/YouTube, writing, editing photos, taking notes... I also can use it to do some work remotely. It mostly has replaced my MacBook.

Most of the days, when I'm not too lazy, I'll bring my Pro with me at work and use it with a keyboard as a separate device &amp; screen for more personal web searches and listening to music, with the ability to take it with me in a meeting and take notes.

The iPad mini is the one I use in public transports to read, qiockly annote a PDF, listen to music and answer messages without having to bring my iPhone out. I also use it at home to listen to lossless music thanks to its headphone jack and my more high-end headphones.

&amp;#x200B;

I do feel that sometimes, having two iPads feels a bit overkill, especially when I take the two with me at work + my iPhone X.

To balance that out, I'll likely stop bringing my iPad Pro at work with me everyday and just bring the Mini, unless I know I'll have a good use for the Pro (going to a café after work or having meetings...).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I download a lot of music (mostly lossless) on my iPhone and iPad Pro, which respectively hold 256GB and 512GB.

1) It's not just about the revenue when it comes to taxing billionaires. There's a concern amongst many that the country has developed an overly powerful billionaire class who is too influential in politics and society. Heavily taxing this group is intended to combat this. Would it be effective? Unfortunately, I don't have high hopes. Our founding fathers were smart enough back in the day to see how extreme generational wealth corrupted a lot of Europe's history and that's why we've always had a heavy estate tax on the wealthy compared to other nations. Through creative accounting and political influence, generational wealth is a severe problem in our society though these days imo.

2) Income disparity has been growing in the US for several decades. Statistically, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. This is a problem in terms of keeping our economy strong overall and there's a good chance we'll see massive economic repercussions if this trend continues unabated. https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SI.POV.GINI/rankings This is a listing of countries by Gini Coefficient (an indicator of income equality). We're sitting at 59 next to Turkey and Uganda. The countries higher on the list have less income equality, the countries lower on the list have more. Take a look at that list and see if you want your economy and society to be amongst the countries on the top or the bottom.

3) It's not just about taxing literal billionaires - that is indeed a very small number.

No one said anything for a few seconds, then Doctor Strange replied, ""I think bowing is more European and Asian tradition.""

They walked with Drax, Mantis and Quill through the hallways of the Wakandan palace, escorted by a few Dora Milaje. Peter Parker kept looking around, Drax and Quill had their eyes fixed to the floor, Mantis almost seemed to be shivering and Strange was looking straight ahead.

Eventually they arrived at a control room. The front 2 soldiers crossed their arms in front of their chest. One spoke: ""Ubungangamsha bakho. Uneendwendwe.""

T'Challa looked up from the circular table in the centre and stood up, face looking forlorn. Still in his armour, he approached the group.

Peter adopted the gesture the guards had and crossed his arms over his chest. This caught T'Challa's eye.

""I remember you... You were at the airport in Germany.""

Peter dropped the gesture. ""Uh y-yeah... that- that was me. I'm Spider-Man.""

""T'Challa."" He shook Peter's hand.

""You're the kid with the webs that Stark had."" Sam Wilson pushed himself off a wall and stepped closer.

Peter almost flinched at the mention of his name. ""Yeah... Listen, sorry about the webbing and the kicking, no hard feelings?""

""Maybe."" Sam's arms were folded in front of him.

""Right... okay..."" Peter looked around the room. ""And you, I remember you too."" He pointed at Bucky, who was sitting on the floor with his arm detached, staring into the middle distance, . ""B-Bucky, wasn't it?""

The man didn't respond.

""He ain't taking it too well,"" said Sam.

""Who have you brought with you?"" asked T'Challa.

""Actually, I brought them,"" said Doctor Strange. ""My name is Doctor Strange, and these are... Drax, Mantis and... Starlord. They're the Guardians of the Galaxy.""

""I am Groot?"" came a voice from the back.

""Groot!"" Mantis ran out to give the creature a hug, followed by the other Guardians. 

Quill said, ""Groot... Groot, where's Rocket?""

Groot looked up at him. Mantis could sense the answer and started crying again. ""I... am Groot.""

""No... no, NO!"" Drax slammed on the table with force enough to break it was it not made from Vibranium. Nearby guards lowered their spears and he growled at them

""Drax, stop. That's enough,"" said Quill.

""You're one to talk! We had him! We had Thanos and then you lost him because you had a tantrum about Gamorra!"" He shoved Quill away and stomped towards Strange ""And you! Magic Man! You saved the Iron Man in vain and destroyed half the universe. Gamorra, Nebula, Rocket, the Iron Man and half the universe are dead. They suffered the same fate as my family..."" Drax breathed heavily and sat down. ""I don't care if I have to walk across space to him, I will find Thanos and I will kill him painfully.""

""How do we find him?"" asked Wanda. She was sitting in a chair, looking grave.

""That's what I came to talk about."" Stephen stepped forwards. ""I placed a tracking enchantment on the Time Stone before I handed it over. Give me a few hours, the sorcerers of Earth will find him.""

""And then what do we do?"" said T'Challa.

Peter Parker said, ""Then we call the Avengers and...""

""They're gone,"" interrupted Sam.

""... wha-""

""THEY'RE DEAD!"" yelled Bucky. ""Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Thor.... Steve... They're all dust! We're all that's left.""

""No... no they... what are we going to do then?""

""I am Groot."" Groot dropped Stormbreaker on the table with a thud.

Drax walked over. ""Use that? What is that?""

""I am Groot.""

""Thor's Thanos killing weapon,"" said Quill.

Wanda picked up the axe and gripped it, making Drax frown at her. ""Then we use it to finish him."" The blade started to spark with red energy.

""Before that, we all rest and heal,"" said T'Challa. ""While this... wizard contacts his cult.""

We are a democracy, the electorate (and country more generally..) are split on a specific issue, the split is quite narrow (as seen from the referendum, a relatively small majority want the UK to leave the EU, a minority want the UK to remain). Parliament mirrors that split. As a result, it's quite hard for anyone to force anything through as such.

However, Parliament have legislated to take us out of the EU, and we are going through that exit process. It is not, and should not be surprising that given the large amount (albeit minority..) support for remaining, that a concerted effort has been made in Parliament and generally to prevent it (presumably in the hope that there is a significant shift in public opinion).

That is our democracy working, it means that people have a say and see their views reflected by their representatives in Parliament. It doesn't mean we won't leave, it doesn't mean that one side or the other are being ignored, but it does mean that neither side can rapidly or easily simply do whatever they want.

In that context, what 'simple' solution is there for this 'simple' problem? 

And as an aside, the amount of disdain for democracy (when people feel it hasn't delivered for them) and the apparent confusion about what the implications of people having a say in their own futures  means is far more problematic than any international perception.

The job is being done, there isn't an easy way through, mistakes are always going to be made in a complicated political process, they always are. But there is no easy or rapid solution or any way to guarantee that a fractured country, led by a minority government will be able to deliver anything quickly or clearly.

Conspiracy theorists claim both holes are far too small to have been made by a Boeing 757. ""How does a plane 125 ft. wide and 155 ft. long fit into a hole which is only 16 ft. across?"" asks reopen911.org, a Web site ""dedicated to discovering the bottom line truth to what really occurred on September 11, 2001.""The truth is of even less importance to French author Thierry Meyssan, whose baseless assertions are fodder for even mainstream European and Middle Eastern media. In his book The Big Lie, Meyssan concludes that the Pentagon was struck by a satellite-guided missile—part of an elaborate U.S. military coup. ""This attack,"" he writes, ""could only be committed by United States military personnel against other U.S. military personnel.""
FACT: When American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon's exterior wall, Ring E, it created a hole approximately 75 ft. wide, according to the ASCE Pentagon Building Performance Report. The exterior facade collapsed about 20 minutes after impact, but ASCE based its measurements of the original hole on the number of first-floor support columns that were destroyed or damaged. Computer simulations confirmed the findings.
Why wasn't the hole as wide as a 757's 124-ft.-10-in. wingspan? A crashing jet doesn't punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building, says ASCE team member Mete Sozen, a professor of structural engineering at Purdue University. In this case, one wing hit the ground; the other was sheared off by the force of the impact with the Pentagon's load-bearing columns, explains Sozen, who specializes in the behavior of concrete buildings. What was left of the plane flowed into the structure in a state closer to a liquid than a solid mass. ""If you expected the entire wing to cut into the building,"" Sozen tells PM, ""it didn't happen.""
The tidy hole in Ring C was 12 ft. wide—not 16 ft. ASCE concludes it was made by the jet's landing gear, not by the fuselage.
Claim: Conspiracy theorists insist there was no plane wreckage at the Pentagon. ""In reality, a Boeing 757 was never found,"" claims pentagonstrike.co.uk, which asks the question, ""What hit the Pentagon on 9/11?""
FACT: Blast expert Allyn E. Kilsheimer was the first structural engineer to arrive at the Pentagon after the crash and helped coordinate the emergency response. ""It was absolutely a plane, and I'll tell you why,"" says Kilsheimer, CEO of KCE Structural Engineers PC, Washington, D.C. ""I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box.""

There's plenty of land for solar panels that doesn't involve the very expensive business of building stuff on heavily used transport infrastructure. Even building a footbridge over a railway or road is very expensive and requires traffic to be stopped while it's installed. 

For comparison, installing overhead electrification on existing railways can cost $10m+ per km for an operating double-track railway. It involves driving piles and burying cables around existing infrastructure including signalling cables, operating trains, bridges and crossings and points and all the rest. You need to figure out where all the buried cables are, you need to investigate the ground conditions along the whole route, you need to design everything so it can operate safely and won't lead to anything interfering with fast-moving trains then you need to install the whole thing in short gaps overnight and at weekends or shut down a whole section of railway for extended periods with all the disruption that involves. If you wanted to install panels on a railway with existing overhead electrification you'd have the additional challenge of working in very close proximity to 25kV cables and needing to ensure clearances so the whole thing would need to be enormous and engineered to a very high standard. If you did it on a non-electrified line, you'd make it much harder to electrify the line without ripping out the solar panels. 

I can't see overhead solar panels being cheaper than overhead electrification but it would come with the bonus of providing almost zero benefit and huge disbenefits to the railway so it would be impossible to get permission even if you paid for the whole thing. Any kind of maintenance would be vastly more expensive because of the location.

Trying to do the same on a road would face similar challenges but large roads are even wider and have far more vehicles on them, more junctions, sometimes they form the only way of accessing certain places and traffic is not centrally coordinated so in many ways it's even more disruptive to close big sections for long periods of time. Projects like 'smart motorways' which involve installing overhead gantries and communications cables to allow varying speed limits and running on the hard shoulder tend to be even more expensive per km than railway electrification. Installing solar panels over the whole road would again be much more expensive and deliver almost no benefit to the road, with significant disbenefits and very high maintenance costs. Again, it would be impossible to get permission to do this.

&gt; He denounced the opaque legal process that has ensnared him as “the Moscow goat rodeo.”

&gt; Mr. Whelan, 49, a Trump supporter who is a citizen of the United States, Britain, Canada and Ireland, has repeatedly denied being a spy and again declared his innocence in court on Thursday. He had asked to be released from pretrial detention in a grim Moscow prison and placed under house arrest instead; the judge rejected the request.

&gt; “I am asking the leaders and governments in Ottawa, Dublin, London and Washington for their help and public statements of support,” said Mr. Whelan, who works in corporate security, reading from a handwritten statement as consular officials from the United States and Ireland looked on.

&gt; The espionage charges against Mr. Whelan, which he has categorically denied, carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison.

&gt; Mr. Trump and his top officials have stayed mostly silent about Mr. Whelan, a former United States Marine and law enforcement officer who in late December was arrested on a spying charge while at a luxury hotel near the Kremlin while in Moscow to attend a wedding.

&gt; Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, tweeted on Sunday that he had met with Mr. Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth, “on how to support her brother.” Mr. Bolton said that “Russia has provided no evidence of any wrongdoing,” but stopped short of declaring him a victim of wrongful imprisonment.

&gt; “The U.S. has still not said that Paul’s been wrongfully detained, wrongfully imprisoned,” Mr. Whelan’s twin brother, David, said in an email message. “After 6 months and no evidence, is there a reason the U.S., Irish, U.K., and Canadian governments aren’t being more publicly vocal about this lack of evidence, and the legal violations by Russian authorities?”

&gt; Mr. Whelan’s December arrest at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow, made public only several days later, prompted speculation that he had been picked up to be exchanged for one or more Russians held in American jails. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has frequently voiced outrage at the arrest of Russian citizens by the United States and demanded their release.

&gt; In the latest such case, a Russian software developer, Oleg Tishchenko, pleaded guilty on Wednesday in Salt Lake City to smuggling F-16 fighter-jet manuals to Moscow. He denied being a spy and said he merely wanted to develop a realistic flight simulator. The judge sentenced the Russian to one year in prison but ordered his immediate deportation to Moscow because he had already served his time in pretrial detention.

&gt; In his courtroom statement on Thursday, Mr. Whelan indicated that investigators from Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., which is handing the case, were pressuring him to confess, which would relieve them of having to produce evidence in court.

&gt; “My life has been threatened my rights have been denied,” said Mr. Whalen, who appeared to be healthy. “I have been isolated in order to force a confession.”

&gt; Asked about an earlier statement that he was being mistreated, he said that guards at Lefortovo Prison, the tsarist-era jail where he is being held, had become a “little bit nicer” but added: “They are not the problem.” The problem, he said, are the “S.V.R. and F.S.B.,” a reference to Russia’s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies.

&gt; Mr. Whelan’s Russian lawyer, Vladimir A. Zherebenkov, said that his client had been framed and that investigators had produced no evidence to support the accusation of espionage other than a flash drive found in the back pocket of Mr. Whelan’s trousers.

&gt; The lawyer said Mr. Whelan had no knowledge of the flash drive, which he said had been planted by a Russian friend who “works in the system,” apparently a reference to Russia’s security apparatus. He declined to elaborate.

&gt; Mr. Whelan had made numerous trips to Russia over a decade and cultivated dozens of Russian friends through social media. His lawyer said that months before his arrest Mr. Whelan had traveled, along with the person who later set him up, to Sergiev Posad, the site of an Orthodox monastery north of Moscow, and had been waiting for photos and videos of their trip there together.

&gt; A Russian news agency close to the security services reported in January that the flash drive found in Mr. Whelan’s possession contained a full list of names of the employees of a secret Russian security agency. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has described Mr. Whelan as having been “caught red-handed.”

&gt; American officials have been more closed-mouthed about the case, only occasionally denouncing the absence of solid evidence and restrictions on consular access.

&gt; Employed before his arrest as director of global security for an automotive parts manufacturer based in Michigan, Mr. Whelan on Thursday thanked his employer and said cryptically: “The situation is work-related. Please insure maximum cooperation.”

&gt; Court bailiffs hustled reporters out of the courtroom as Mr. Whelan shouted in protest, “This is the sort of treatment I am getting to keep me from speaking to rights advocates and to keep me from speaking to journalists.”

&gt; Complaining that he had been denied full access to consular officials, books and medical care, he said: “This is obviously a politically motivated event.”",True,False,False,,0,1564678799,,1564679685,0,{},evpr8cl,False,t3_ckp2dx,False,False,t1_evpqw24,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/ckp2dx/how_do_you_feel_about_trump_sending_the_us/evpr8cl/,False,,1573419733,6,True,[],False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,r/AskTrumpSupporters,public,0,

Problema é... agrotóxicos orgânicos são mais tóxicos ao seres humanos que agrotóxicos sintéticos. Pois quando se vai sintetizar um agrotóxico, ele é feito de forma tal a ser o mais tóxico possível ao seu alvo (seja peste, ervas, insetos, etc), e menos tóxica ao ser humano.

Agrotóxico orgânico por outro lado, é algo ""natural"" que plantas desenvolvem para combater as pestes, problema é que é abrangente, portanto afeta todas as formas de vida, inclusive humana. E por ser menos eficiente, precisa ser utilizado em maior quantidade.

Scholarship has increasingly overturned this antiquated notion that there was no proper medieval science. In fact, the first 5 pages in the introduction to medieval volume (2) the recent Cambridge History of Science (2013) are devoted simply to a discussion of why it is misleading to think of there being a division between 'medieval' science and 'early modern' science at all.

In particular, while we might wish to say that by the 16th century there was a significant growth in the discussion of physics as an autonomous subject, or something like this, the notion that the Middle Ages was a regression in comparison to antiquity is not taken seriously by modern historians (at least those with any degree of relevant specialism in the period). For example, in the last 20 years or so it has become increasingly clear how much of 'renaissance' science is really indebted to the substantial work on mechanics that was undertaken in the 14th century. 

&gt;In Europe, people have been interested in nature since Augustine mainly as a sign of the divine will and therefore a source of revelation.

I suggest you go read some of the actual scholarship on the subject going back to the late 19th century. More broadly, you will need to square such a statement with the intense interest in Aristotle's works of physics and Plato's Timaeus. This sort of systematic interest in astrology actually coincides more with the growth of interest in cosmology and physics from the 13th century through to early modern period. Aquinas himself spilled a great deal of ink producing extensive commentaries on Aristotle's scientific texts.

&gt;We have only handed down a few works from that time, e.g. by Adelard of Bath, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Witelo and John Peckham.

As a result this list is very idiosyncratic and indeed quite deficient. Most obviously, you miss off two of the most obviously important authors on physics: Jean Buridan and Nicolas Oresme, who both significantly anticipate the works of Copernicus and Galileo. 

But anyways, just to give one representative example, the authors who Grant cites for discussion of the question: 'Whether the earth always rests or is always moved in the middle [or center] of the heavens or world': Michael Scot, Cecco d'Ascoli, John of Jandun, Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Oresme, Themon Judaeus, Johannes de Magistris, Johannes Versor, Thomas Bricot, and John Major (to cut ourselves off rather arbitrarily around the turn of the 16th century).

Some suggestions:

2: There are some suggestions [here](https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/pig-out-its-your-favourite-bacon-butties-in-london-090415), personally I really rate Dishoom's bacon naan, or Le Swine. 

10. As long as you know you're buying entertainment, not actual history. It's pricey for what it is, but fun. How gregarious are you? For actual Henry VIII history head to Hampton Court Palace. 

13. [Try here.](https://www.applausestore.com/calendar) The amount of queuing you'd have to do to be in with a chance of getting a seat though - honestly I'd rather spend my paid-for holiday time doing something other than standing in queue in a street for up to 1.5hrs (without even the guarantee of a seat). 

14. Brings yours with you, plus an adaptor. Abusing the returns policy is a shitty thing to do, and most retailers have a rule that if the item has been opened and used they won't process refunds, precisely because they're wise to these kinds of shenanigans. Why not book in at a [Blow dry bar?](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/best-blowdries-in-london)

18. Have you looked at the [menu](https://www.nandos.co.uk/food/menu)? They do 1/4 chicken legs extra-spicy if that's what you like. Nando's isn't fine dining, it's just a cheap chain restaurant that became a meme - I think it's fairly similar to Applebees or Olive Garden (although I've never been at either). 

19. I've not see a treacle sponge pudding on the menu of any London restaurant recently (it's seen as a very old-fashioned dessert), but [Rules](https://rules.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/JUNE-MENU-front.pdf) is London's oldest restaurant, and they do sticky toffee pudding and golden syrup steam sponge, both of which are very similar. 

22. The Post Office is fine - decent rates and no fuss. [Thomas Exchange](https://www.thomasexchange.co.uk/) has the best rates, but you have to order your currency online in advance for pickup in store to take advantage of those rates. 

23. Cheques are very rare in the UK, most retailers won't even accept them (or at the very least the 19yo processing your purchase will be pretty flummoxed by them, we haven't used cheques for about 15yrs). 

24. You don't need ID for any form of payment in the UK. Your US ID should be fine for booze. 

2. Nothing unique to London - in certain tourist areas you occasionally get 'Tibetan Monks' trying to give you a bracelet and then asking for cash. Just ignore anyone trying to give you anything. And I'm sure you know better than to get involved in street gambling (cup &amp; ball, cards/find the queen etc). 

9. You can pick up a meal deal (prepacked sandwich, snack + bottle of drink) from most supermarkets, or Boots/Superdrug/WH Smith etc for around £3.50/£4.00. Wetherspoons and Sam Smiths pubs are the cheapest, you can pick up a pint for £3.50 in most. That's the cheapest food and drink you'll find on sale in London, if you can't afford that then go the supermarket, but bear in mind you can't carry booze into bars etc (some places may even check your bags). You can get a 3 course meal from the prix-fixe menu in the fancy surroundings at [Brasserie Zedel](http://zedel2.d3r-cdn.com/pdfs/original/4766-zedel-mainmenu-035-aw-web.pdf) for £13.95. Look [here](http://www.londoncheapeats.com/central) or [here](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/cheap-eats-london-food-meals-dinner-under-ten-pounds-a3994566.html) for more cheap eats. 

11. Ask the lovely folks at r/oxford 

12. You'll only be able to use Netflix US. 

13. Try [here](https://www.londonnet.co.uk/films/)

14. Lots of places do a full English breakfast (definitely not just on Sundays). You hotel should probably offer one, or look at the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/londonfood) guide. 

16. Check with your airline carrier, they'll have full details. I've travelled around Europe with carry on luggage that contained power packs and bluetooth speakers, no idea what your TSA rules are though, and US carriers may be different. 

17. I guess - people do snooze on the tube (I've certainly nodded off a few times). The biggest risk is probably missing your stop. Why would you actively want to do this though? 

19. Many cafes/pubs/bars etc will have free wifi, and all underground tube stations offer free wifi (but not in the tunnels when on the train, there's no signal) but just wandering around the streets? Not really. 

20. Pretty much any place that serves food/drink and has a sit down area will have a toilet for customers (although you may have to ask for a key/get a code to unlock the door). Only larger department stores will have toilets. Most tourist attractions will have toilets, and most major train stations (e.g. Liverpool Street, Victoria, Waterloo, Paddington) will have toilets. There are toilet-finder apps in the App store/Play store, try those. 

21. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/2dfit9/londons_most_overrated/) are a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/3gw71p/im_visiting_your_area_of_london_what_thing_should/) threads asking the same question. Personally, I think Madame Tussauds and the London Dungeons are overrated, but scores of teenage kids seem to like them so what do I know. 

22. All the bus tours as basically the same. I've done 'Hop On Hop Off Bus' band tours in several cities and they seem pretty good. 

24. Have you mixed up the Hop On Hop Off Bus brand (the expensive tour buses, around £35-£40, related to question 22 above) with general London buses? Download the Citymapper app, it'll help you navigate London public transport. Also read the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) entry on travel, it'll help you. 

25. Incredibly subjective. I love the V&amp;A because I really like art and design, others prefer the Natural History Museum because dinosaurs are fun, or the British Museum contains amazing artefacts stolen from every corner of the globe. Tate Britain is a brilliant art gallery, as is Tate modern and the National Gallery. What kind of stuff are you into/what things to you prioritise? 

29. Probably cheaper to check another bag - posting heavy/bulky items from UK to US is very expensive if you want it there in a reasonable length of time. 

30. See above re posting bulky items. You can buy a cheap plastic frame for about £15 on Amazon, but I don't see how you'd get it back easily. 

31. Shoreditch is full of bars with trendy young hipsters. Any bars/restaurants that play loud music won't attract an older crowd, so basically aim for anywhere you can hear the music playing from the street and you'll be grand. 

32. The London Transport Museum has lots of great London-themed gifts. The British Museum and the V&amp;A also have excellent gift shops.",True,False,False,,0,1564680875,,False,0,{},evpv9sy,False,t3_cj4mtx,False,True,t1_evp0l45,/r/london/comments/cj4mtx/faqmegathread_for_visitors_and_new_existing/evpv9sy/,False,,1573421655,6,True,[],False,london,t5_2qkog,r/london,public,0,

Yes they definitely have less of interest in military spending as the US but I would be apprehensive in sweeping them all as having little importance globally. I guess it depends what industry you work in whether one needs to take note of the economic/political changes in these countries. Switzerland, Luxembourg and Ireland are just some of the countries that have a larger GDP per capita than the US and many US companies rely heavily on these countries for tax benefits. From a financial/tax perspective- these countries are hugely important and I would argue the general population in the US doesn’t really understand how much so. 

Homogeneous is an interesting point. So the US has a foreign born population of 13.7%. Switzerland is 23.8%, Luxembourg is 44.5% and Ireland was 10% in 2006 but now nearly 1 in 8 are foreign nationals. 

I’m not sure what you mean by “not dealing with diversity well” - can you expand on that? 

Yes a growth in far right movement (including the US) is a huge problem with any progressive policies. However, the political spectrum sits far further right than Western Europe, so it is worth taking that into account.

Of course you can up and leave? Why couldn’t you? Of course, you need to have a skilled job or alternatively go to study. But you 100% can up and leave. 

I find it’s a reoccurring thing with people here to say to themselves that things aren’t good, but convince themselves that things are worse elsewhere - and if that’s not true, these places are not important. It really blocks positive change. 

Instead I think “oh that’s interesting that US has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, yet spends the most per capita on healthcare. What’s going wrong? Which countries do it well and how can we copy them?” or in the case of police brutality “the rate at which US police officers shoot and kill civilians is so high, why is this and where does it not happen? “Eg.

And you’re doing the right thing trying to research and help her get some answers. This can be such a daunting illness and it helps to have someone supportive in your corner so good on you! 

I don’t know it it’ll be of help but I’ve recently been switched to a birth control pill without any estrogen in it. The pill is called Visanne (not sure if that’s just its name in Europe and Australia, but it’s by Bayer so I’d be surprised if you couldn’t find it in the U.S.). It’s a pill that’s been formulated specifically for women with endometriosis. It’s meant to help reduce pain. I didn’t even know this pill existed until I saw an endometriosis specialist who prescribes only this for their patients.

Sadly, my doc before kept me on a pill that lead to a deep spiral of depression and anxiety along with weight gain, and other complications. Looking back, I never should have stayed in her care but I was desperate for help.

So far, I don’t think it’s been enough time on this new pill to fully speak for it, but I feel less cloudy somehow and I’m really hopeful to see improvement in my pain and mood.

Bottom line, research different pills and go with your gut – don’t listen to any doctors that tell your wife she HAS to take one specific type of pill or doesn’t answer your questions.

En septiembre de 2017 una nube ligeramente radiactivo se desplazó a lo largo de gran parte de Europa, aunque su existencia no fue divulgada en la prensa.
Ningún gobierno se responsabilizó entonces de la propagación de material radiactivo, pero un nuevo estudio asegura tener la respuesta sobre el origen del incidente.
Cerca de 70 científicos de distintos países se basaron en más de 1.300 mediciones de diferentes puntos del continente europeo para resolver el misterio.
¿Su conclusión? el origen de la nube no fue un accidente en un reactor, sino en una planta de reprocesamiento de combustible nuclear ubicada en territorio ruso.
Las autoridades en Rusia negaron en diversas ocasiones que una de sus plantas fuera el origen de la nube, y no han hecho pública ninguna reacción oficial tras la publicación del nuevo estudio.
""Los datos indican una liberación desde una instalación de reprocesamiento nuclear en el sur de los Urales, posiblemente el complejo nuclear Mayak"", señala el estudio publicado en la revista de la Academia de Ciencias de Estados Unidos, Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
""Descartamos que se haya tratado de la caída de un satélite o de una liberación en territorio rumano, a pesar de que las concentraciones halladas allí fueron elevadas"", agrega el estudio.

""Detectamos rutenio 106 radioactivo. Las mediciones indican la mayor liberación singular de radioactividad de una planta de reprocesamiento civil"", afirmó Georg Steinhauser.
Los autores aseguran que los niveles de radiación fueron bajos yno representaron un riesgo para la salud de los habitantes de Europa.
Entre los expertos que aportaron mediciones se encuentran Dieter Hainz y Paul Saey, del Instituto de Física SubatómicaTU Wien, de Viena.
Los datos fueron evaluados por el profesor Georg Steinhauser, de la Universidad de Hannover, Alemania, junto con Olivier Masson, del Instituto IRSN de Francia.
""Detectamos rutenio 106 radiactivo. Las mediciones indican la mayor liberación singular de radiactividad de una planta de reprocesamiento civil"", afirmó Steinhauser.
Los valores detectados fueron hasta 100 veces más altos que las concentraciones totales medidas en Europa después del accidente nuclear de Fukushima.
El hecho de que no se midieron otras sustancias radiactivas que no fueran rutenio es una indicación clara de que la fuente debe haber sido una planta de reprocesamiento nuclear, de acuerdo a los investigadores.

El rutenio 106 fue detectado en grandes partes de Europa Central y Oriental, además de Asia, la Península Arábiga e incluyso el Caribe.
La primera alarma fue lanzada por científicos en Italia, que notaron un aumento abrupto en las mediciones de rutenio 106.
El material fue posteriormente detectado en grandes partes de Europa Central y Oriental, y fue registrada incluso en Asia y la Península Arábiga.
Los investigadores afirmaron que se encontró rutenio 106 incluso en el Caribe.
La planta Mayak en Rusia ya había sido escenario de la segunda descarga nuclear más grande de la historia en septiembre de 1957, después de la explosión del reactor nuclear de Chernóbil, en Ucrania, en 1986.
En 1957, un tanque con deshechos líquidos de la producción de plutonio estalló, causando altos niveles de contaminación.

El estudio se basó en más de 1.300 mediciones en diferentes puntos del continente europeo.
El lanzamiento de 2017 se produjo de acuerdo al estudio el 25 de setiembre de 2017 al mediodía, casi exactamente 60 años después del incidente de 1957.
""Esta vez, sin embargo, fue un lanzamiento pulsado que terminó muy rápidamente, a diferencia de los lanzamientos de Chernóbil y Fukushima,que duraron varios días"", afirmó Steinhauser.
""Demostramos que el accidente ocurrió en el reprocesamiento de elementos de combustible gastado, en una etapa muy avanzada, poco antes del final de la cadena de proceso. Y aunque actualmente no hay una declaración oficial, tenemos una muy buena idea de lo que pudo haber ocurrido"", agregó el científico.
El estudio señala que el análisis de la distribución de rutenio ""apoya la hipótesis de que el combustible fue reprocesado unos dos años después de ser usado, posiblemente para la producción de una fuente de Cerio 144 para un experimento con neutrinos en Italia"".

I’ve been looking into transmed/truscum discourse recently (and full disclosure, found this thread through a link on their sub). From what I’ve seen, there’s a variety of perspectives on non-binary within that community, and most people seem to see them as valid. Many are even fine with gender non-conforming people, but they just view them as separate from “trans” based on their medical, transition-oriented definition of trans-ness. 

In terms of two-spirit and other Indigenous identities, I’ve found in my experience of learning in a Canadian context that these are often not entirely in the trans umbrella. I saw a presentation by researcher Aniruddha Dutta who spoke about how generalizing Indigenous systems of gender as “trans” or “transgender” can itself be an act of colonization by imposing and privileging a Western understanding of gender. In Canada, the acronym is often LGBTQ2S+, and the two-spirit people I have met did not identify as trans (although I’m sure some do and that’s ok!).

The trade war with China will grow and not even a new administration will be able to repair anything fast with China, because nobody does an agreement with the US without a ratification by Congress. 

China tries to mitigate this strategy by building the network of BRI and makes first steps to attract academics and investors  by easing the visa laws.

In the case the war is further extending it would be foolish of the EU not to try to use this leverage, to get better trade agreements, like the EU did in the case of Canada, Japan and Mercosur.

Daenerys faz uma ponte entre a cena com Jon na Sala do Trono e a visão em que viu o Trono de Ferro na Casa dos Imortais na segunda temporada.

&gt;*DANY: Mas muitos anos depois, eu o vi. O verdadeiro.*

&gt;*JON: Como?*

&gt;*DANY: Em uma visão. O telhado, a neve, o trono ... (pausa) Tudo parecia exatamente assim.*

**3 - Drogon não mirou no Trono de Ferro**

Segundo o roteiro, Drogon estava querendo destruir qualquer coisa em volta e o trono é acidentalmente atingido.

&gt;*Ele olha para Jon. Nós vemos o fogo se acumulando em sua garganta.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jon também vê isso. Ele se prepara para morrer.*  
&gt;

The Reagan administration looked at HIV as something that would force them to spend money on, create programs for, and commit resources to the fight. That was unacceptable.

In many ways, the republican party of today is a magnification and extreme form of what it was back then. The republican party of the 1980s was ""we need to help all these poor beleaguered corporations and rich people. They're under attack by those who want to hold responsible for their fair share of the social contract.""

Their attitude that the poor and the sick deserve no consideration because it might mean they would have to forego a little profit really started back then. The support the republican party gets from ""religious"" groups today has its roots in that era. This was the era of the rise of the ""religious right"" into the political arena. The republican party found it profitable to pander to these now-political ""religious"" organizations

The republican party wanted to keep the money from those ""religious"" groups flowing. The republican party wanted to eliminate corporate funding of employee healthcare and force it on individuals. The republican party wanted to dismantle the existing mental health programs. Tackling HIV was contrary to all these goals. 

There was a strong media push to label HIV as something only scum got. Good, pure people didn't get nasty little viruses. If Reagan said ""this disease needs to be fought"" he risked alienating all that sweet ""religious"" funding and voter base. If he said ""there's a health emergency"" he'd risk all the republican plans to dismantle health care programs of the times.

It took European countries to say ""HIV is a *global* problem"" for the Reagan administration to take action. Even then there was still strong pushback from ""religious-based"" groups. 

[C. Everett Koup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Everett_Koop#AIDS) was barred by the Reagan administration from even addressing the issue during Reagan's first term. Can you imagine that? The Surgeon General of the US being told he can't inform the public about a disease. HIV was on the level of ebola as far as ignorance goes back then. 

In many ways history is repeating itself. Except these days we're fighting for affordable healthcare, unfettered internet access, and even our civil rights and against blatant violations of our Constitution. 

There's an opioid crisis that is taking lives like HIV did. Our veterans are dying by their own hands in record numbers.

Yes? Because that’s how the free market works?

The scroll in art is an element of ornament and graphic design featuring spirals and rolling incomplete circle motifs, some of which resemble the edge-on view of a book or document in  scroll form, though many types are plant-scrolls, which loosely represent plant forms such as vines, with leaves or flowers attached.  Scrollwork is a term for some forms of decoration dominated by spiralling scrolls, today used in popular language for two-dimensional decorative flourishes and arabesques of all kinds, especially those with circular or spiralling shapes.

Scroll decoration has been used for the decoration of a vast range of objects, in all Eurasian cultures, and most beyond. A lengthy evolution over the last two millennia has taken forms of plant-based scroll decoration from Greco-Roman architecture to Chinese pottery, and then back across Eurasia to Europe.

I really want to know if the current proposals outright ban supplemental insurance, but just generally such wouldn't be needed if everyone is on publicly available insurance. It would probably die on its own. Is the outcome of this really bad in the UK, Canada, France and every other developed nation? 

\&gt; Would it be okay to say refugee problem?

It depends. I think a lot of people aren't looking at the root causes of people fleeing their countries (hint, the root causes are often world superpowers disrupting countries with war profiteering, CIA intervention, a long history of colonialism/imperialism) that the superpowers aren't taking responsibility for. If we make a problem, shouldn't we be part of fixing it? 

Additionally, it really depends how much awareness you're bringing to the table about refugees, and how much race is being conflated into this. Most Americans today are ok with the idea that we let in many (perhaps not enough) Jewish people in the 1930-1940s to escape religious persecution, but most people see them as ""white"" and thus ""the same"". Most Americans are also ok with the idea that many of initial European settlers of the US were religious refugees. And that pretty much all the Europeans who came here were essentially fleeing their own countries to make a better life for themselves instead of ""fixing their own countries"". But, we view all of them as ""white"" and thus ""ok"". Now that it's more brown people who are refugees (and many Muslims, again, pay attention to the history of those countries and how superpowers have messed with those countries for oil)... well, suddenly it's not-ok. 

Also, do keep in mind there's a huge history of ""\[religion\] problem"" that's often culminated in thousands, if not millions of people dying. Words have meaning. If you have a ""final solution"" to the problem in mind, then we have a problem. 

If you're keeping all of this in mind, and have compassionate solutions in mind, then I suppose it's ok to think of as a ""refugee problem""; although the wording could be more compassionately phrased as a humanitarian crisis that's been caused by the hands of the powerful and wealthy, and hurting the poor and often powerless.

[],,NaturaSiveDeus,1523586270.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3a6bvdn,False,[],"&gt;What is the difference between Yiddish, Hebrew, and Jewish?

Technically, Yiddish means ""Jewish,"" but it refers not to Jews as a people, but to the language of the Ashkenazim, the Jews who migrated to Germany and Eastern Europe. It is essentially a dilaect of High German, with elements of Hebrew and Aramic sprinkled in and written using the Hebrew alphabet.

Hebrew was a designation for the people who would become the Israelites and Jews, amd also a synonym for these people themselves. It is also the ancestral language of the Jewish people; it ceased to be the spoken language following the second century, but remained the holy tongue of prayer and the Torah for millennia afterwards. The language was revived a century ago as Modern Hebrew, and is now spoken by millions of Jews as their native language.

&gt;Does any aspect of Judaism count as an ethnicity? I assume Judaism is the religious belief whereas Jewish is the ethnicity, and I want to make sure if that's correct or not.

Judaism is the ancestral, binding faith of the Jewish Nation. One who converts to Judaism is doing more than joining a religion, they are becoming members of the Jewish people as a whole. Our halacha (traditional law) prohibits reminding a ger--a convert--that they used to not be a Jew. Jewishness in this regard connotates notions of both ethnicity and tribal or national membership. If this sounds confusing, imagine it like this--some people are ethnically British and have lived in Britian for a thousand years, and some people are immigrants that only recently gained British citizenship, but in the eyes of the law, both are equally British. 

&gt;Is 'Jew' a slur?

No, though it can be used as a slur. Although I do not speak for all Jews in this regard, I myself take no offense to being called a Jew--it's what I am, after all. 

&gt;What is the purpose of a kippah? 

To remind us of our duties and submission to the Divine. A majority of our halachic authorities have ruled that it is wrong to go with an uncovered head, and over the years it simply became tradition.

No?  Funny that.  

All those ones are strangely missing.  

Manipulation works both ways doesn't it! 

 Let's compile a list of all the silly season stories from the dregs of the press that are read by dwindling numbers and are preaching to the converted anyway.  Which isn't actually they many, given we are talking about 30 fucking years.  

And then feed it to hungry remainers so they can laugh at the thick people.  Yes, someone is being manipulated and you can't even see it.

Is this list all it took to sway people?  Goes to show what an absolutely terrible argument for remaining there must be. 

This is what best your arguments?  How embarrassing for you.

 And let's be honest most remainers voted to stay as it was the default.  None of you ""love "" the EU.  None of you even knew what it did or didn't do until it was too late.  ""Oh shit"" we should have taken that more seriously.

Or perhaps you agree with every single thing the EU has ever done?  It's all great is it?  Lucky you.  Lucky that your politics matches perfectly.  A more honest remainer will admit that there are some faults.  Spend some time on other EU subs, you'll see there is actual honest debate.  

The moment you accept there are pros and cons...  You must accept there are valid reasons to want out.

We'll see.

Being fair and rational, you'll all jump at the chance at circulating my list of project fear stories that never materialised.

Good luck with your stockpiling guys.  Project reality innit, better stock up. No more holidays, collapse of the NHS, empty  shelves, no jobs, the cliff edge.  House price crash would be awesome though.

A drop in GDP is fine by me.  I'm with extinction rebellion on that one.  Why are you guys champions of infinite growth and solving our problems with unsustainable immigration.  How unfashionable!  Is that because it's all you've really got?  The arguments for the EU always seem so weak.  The moment the UK doesn't crumble to dust...  You've actually got nothing.

Ostsiedlung (German pronunciation: [ˈɔstˌziːdlʊŋ], literally east settling), in English called the German eastward expansion, was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of Germanic-speaking peoples from the Holy Roman Empire, especially its southern and western portions, into less-populated regions of Central Europe, parts of west Eastern Europe, and the Baltics. The affected area roughly stretched from Estonia in the north all the way to Slovenia in the south and extended into Transylvania, modern-day Romania in the east. In part, Ostsiedlung followed the territorial expansion of the Empire and the Teutonic Order.

According to Jedlicki (1950), in many cases the term ""German colonization"" does not refer to an actual migration of Germans, but rather to the internal migration of native populations (Poles, Hungarians, etc.) from the countryside to the cities, which then adopted laws modeled on those of the German towns of Magdeburg and Lübeck.

We have 320,000 American Characters
147,00 European characters
280,00 Japanese

This sub has roughly 300,000 subs and about 10,000 people on concurrently. I believe we peaked somewhere either around 22k - 26k on ShB Release but I’m not sure. But for the sake of argument let’s add them to the peak concurrent players to ever play this game simultaneously. 40k steam players, 26k players from Reddit who swore off steam puts us at 66k.

It’s incredibly unlikely but let’s just say all 66k players on that one day were from America which makes up roughly 30% of the entire FFXIV population. In that additional 70% we’d end up roughly around 200k players that’s awesome. 

But that’s our roughly peak for the next 2 years and also impossible due to time zones.  Runescape is peaking 90k on a Wednesday. Just some fucking random day. 

Okay what are peaking out now after a month. Well we’re looking at 30k steam players, 10k reddit users (which yeah I know isn’t 100% accurate but we literally don’t have the numbers otherwise) some logic if that’s 30% of the global pop our peak is 120 - 130k that’s super dope. But like I said also super duper impossible. 

Like if we have 700k active players worldwide in the past year over 70, we likely have near 300k+ under 70, also much harder to tell due to the whole free under 35 thing. But it’s fairly rational to assume we have about 1.3 million players in FFXIV. It’s a fair bit unlikely that we still have 1/10th of our global population all playing together at the same time on a Wednesday a month after the expac released. 

But hey that’s just my rough math you can disagree with me. old school runescape still has a fuck load of players on a wednesday and should be respected as a juggernaut on our scene. I don’t even fucking play the game.

In that thread I referenced a podcast by Dad-Starting-Over where he made a comment that if your sex life does not at least somewhat resemble what you see in mainstream man-woman XXX vids, that there is something wrong.

He goes on to explain that for the most part, main stream porn is two fit, attractive, uninhibited, sex-positive people getting it on with each other.

Yes, they are paid actors following something of a script and yes there is going to be cinematic embellishment with the moans and groans and dirty talk for the camera.

But for the most part it is healthy, attractive and sexually uninhibited people doing what fit healthy people who are attracted to each other do.

The feminists and the church ladies and the anti-porn crusaders would have us believe that all porn models are kidnapped and exploited human trafficking victims, but in the free western world I have the feeling the truth is it is hot, horny people making a quick a few quick and easy buck$ doing what they do best. 

In other words we’ve been raised to believe that all porn is fake and exploitive and all porn actresses are exploited victims.  

There may be some truth to that in stuff coming from Mayasia and Eastern Europe and old Soviet Bloc nations but I think most American, adult entertainment is consensual, horny people doing what they dig.

No, I listed two examples of where Christianity promoted and created widespread systems of slavery. These systems encompass more than 1500 years of Christian history.

&gt;But what you have not done is shown how Christianity had more slavery than its neighbors and how this was the norm of all of Christian history.

But I'm not making that claim, I'm arguing against the claim that Christian civilization is the smallest offender in terms of slavery, other than zoroastrianism. Given that Christian societies in Europe were founded on slavery (serfdom), then the claim is clearly false. Christian societies engaged in systemic slavery. Given that the NA slave trade and the EA slave trade were competitors for brutality, scale, and human suffering, that makes Christian civilization one of the worst offenders in human history.

&gt;Christianity was founded in 30 AD but the Middle Ages started sometime like 500 AD.

&gt;Also serfdom is not chattel slavery 

False, educate yourself on what chattel slavery actually is. It's merely defined as a system of slavery where people are treated as personal property. Serfdom meets that qualification because a serf could be bought, sold and traded by his Lord and was considered his Lord's property, ergo serfdom is a form of chattel slavery.

Chattel slavery is a general term. Serfdom references a specific system of slavery. They aren't different, one encompasses the other. Slavery doesn't need to be as brutal as British/US slavery to be called ""chattel slavery"", it merely needs to meet a basic set of criteria. Namely, people being bought and sold as commodities. This was possible under the many forms of Serfdom.

&gt;Serfdom was bad but it was a movement away from chattel slavery and one specific to Christianity.

Also false, Asian cultures had systems of serfdom in the same time period, including Korea, Japan, China.

Basically if someone died from a violence it was tradition to brick in the window in the room where the actual death happened, or the window nearest to the physical spot the death occurred if there was more than one window in the room. In parts of Ireland it was tradition to brick in the *highest* window nearest to the site of the death...

Depending on who you asked it was to EITHER prevent the vengeful spirit of the victim from finding the room again and causing problems for other innocent people who would eventually reside there (space often being at a premium and a need for a place to live often overcame fear of death) OR it was to prevent the spirit of the victim from leaving the room to seek vengeance on its murderer (and possibly anyone who happened to be near them at the time). 

So windows were bricked over to either keep ghosts out or to keep them in, the common thought being that the spirit would leave/ come back by the closest opening to the outside world such as the window. If you physically and permanently 'erased' the window the spirit would be confused, unable to find the location of so much pain and distress again or unable to leave the location of pain and distress to get revenge.

Same principle under which mirrors were covered during the mourning period. Not because people didn't want to see themselves looking awful and ragged, but because mirrors (and windows) represent a thin barrier between 'another place' and were often thought to be used by spirits and fae as doorways into our world. 

If you look at older manor houses, castles, etc., you can often find a bricked in window somewhere on it. Around the 1950's it was thought to be embarrassing to have such a visual reminder of 'stupid old nonsense beliefs' so a lot of the used-to-be windows were either opened up and framed out again, or more likely the facade was built up over the indented window space to look like unbroken wall, being the cheaper and easier option.",True,False,False,,0,1564701208,,1564785270,0,{},evr3nz1,False,t3_ckpc8n,False,True,t3_ckpc8n,/r/CrappyDesign/comments/ckpc8n/think_your_missing_a_window_there_bud/evr3nz1/,False,,1573442803,1,True,[],False,CrappyDesign,t5_2sa3m,r/CrappyDesign,public,0,

The countries the UK will most likely sign a free trade agreement with is Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This agreement will happen. No questions about it. The problem what will the terms be of this agreement. 

Canada, Australia and New Zealand already have a free trade relationship with each other CPTPP. That deal alone is worth 13.5 trillion dollars or 13.4 percent of the global economy. So basically this deal is just to add the UK into the mix. 

Canada has three trade deal with the US (USMCA, NAFTA and CUSFTA) which accounts 74 percent of all Canadian trade.  USMCA gives the US and Mexico a veto over any Canadian trade deal. Canada also has a deal with its second largest trading partner, the EU (CETA). This represents 10 percent of all Canadian trade.  

Canada will not risk these agreement for a trade deal with the UK which represents only 2.5 percent of all Canadian trade. So whatever trade terms the UK gains will be less favourable.

What about Australia and New Zealand. Britain represents 
3.4 percent of all trades with Australia and New Zealand. The vast majority of their trade is with China and CPTPP states. Again they will not jeopardize their trade with those states for a mere 3.4 percent. So whatever deal is signed with be less favourable than CPTPP. 

Actually had the UK stayed in Europe, it could have used it's leverage to get a free trade deal between Australia and New Zealand. The UK could have been the base for all trade between these countries and Europe thanks to their common language and historic connections.

Taking an example from your comment: you said it was a beautiful experience. While ""beautiful"" is gender-neutral, in Portuguese ""lindo""/""linda"" has to agree in gender with the noun. ""experiência"" is a female noun, so ""Isso foi uma linda experiência"" would be more adequate. This kind of mistake is pretty common from non-native speakers and kinda solves itself with practice, so you shouldn't worry too much with that.

""increvil"" (""incrível"") and ""experenxia"" (""experiência"") are harder to tackle. Usage of diacritics is pretty hard to learn and Brazilian Portuguese differs a bit from European Portuguese in this point. They don't follow easy rules. Unless you're interested enough to grab a textbook, just copycat the spellchecker.

IMO the best way to improve your vocabulary is casually consuming media in Portuguese.

1. 1.a person who strongly identifies with their own nation and vigorously supports its interests, **especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.**

Nationalists believe that their nation and their national culture/its people are superior to others. The Nazis, for example, believed that pure Germans were the superior race and pursued a campaign across much of Europe to promote their culture and their beliefs and force it on other nations (as of course you and everyone else knows). It's different from just being proud of your country or even simply being an isolationist.

These include free speech and the ability to own guns for defense of yourself, your neighbor and your country.

They're cheap because 99% of guns are semiautomatic. It's just what a ""gun"" is in the modern world. One trigger pull = one bullet is fired.

You have to realize a America a very young country which shares a very frontier style culture. We were founded by essentially ISIS in the sense that it was a minor religious group who one day said ""nah fuck this shit, this country us ours now"" and defeated the major world power in order to secure it.

As such the concept of an armed citizenry is very, very deeply embedded within all of American culture and the right to be armed is codified in the absolute highest law of the land that even congress, the president or the courts cannot touch. The only way to amend this law would be if basically 75% of the states all agreed to change it, something which will potentially never happen but will certainly not happen in my lifetime.

Support for the right to self defense, which is viewed as an inherent human right in America and codified into law as such, is something that is fervently popular and has no sign of declining anytime in the foreseeable future.


You ask yourself ""But in countries where guns are banned, people are not shot"". A valid claim. However the mindset here is that sure we could all be infinitely safer with speech censored, books burned, alcohol prohibited, every phone call monitored etc, potentially millions of lives would be saved in such a system, but again that frontier mentality persists and therefore Americans have almost uniformly elected for dangerous freedom VS peaceful slavery. Whether that's the right choice or not is yet to be seen but ultimately in a country where shootings are at record lows as well as crime in general, there's simply no realistic movement to remove the right to be armed currently.

I, and in fact we, all understand how foreign this concept must seem to our brothers and sisters abroad across Europe etc as it's absolutely true no guns means no more shootings, but to be quite frank, our entire country as an entity was founded upon the singular concept of ""kill the Europeans if they ever come here, use the shovels and farm tools if you have to, we fight to the last man"". As a result of this cultural legacy people to this day value the concept of owning guns to kill intruders over frankly everything else because everyone who didn't believe this was removed from the gene pool here long ago.


Kinda barbaric, but it also just is what it is. Arguments like ""people don't become shot in the face in places where there are no guns"" simply will never prevail here because the country was founded on the principle of shoot everyone else in the face ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",True,False,False,,0,1564718251,,1564728786,0,{},evrtr6x,False,t3_ckrsnt,False,False,t1_evqqq4s,/r/worldnews/comments/ckrsnt/trump_us_will_hit_300_billion_worth_of_chinese/evrtr6x/,False,,1573455226,5,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

It is literally the first thing that comes to my mind. This is because the Western interpretation of  ""human rights"", ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" are conditioned on the elimination of the Indigenous people and the subsequent mass distortion and denial of this history. I cannot even think about the concept of human rights without thinking about its contradictions and hypocrisies.

And what fundamentally pisses me off about all these sycophants of Western-styled democracy, may they come in the forms of political pundits across the political spectrum, or some misguided HK protesters, is that they willingly ignore this reality.

&gt;The prospect of Americans soon being able to legally access Canadian pharmacies in order to obtain dramatically cheaper drugs is **drawing criticism from health-care advocates who warn of the spectre of drug shortages north of the border.**

&gt;""This definitely raises the risk,"" said **Kim Hanson, executive director of federal affairs for Diabetes Canada**, told The Current's guest host Laura Lynch.

&gt;The **U.S. has the world's highest drug prices**. Faced with voter anger over the steep and rising costs of drugs, President Donald Trump's administration announced Wednesday **it will set up a system to allow Americans to legally import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada**. 

&gt;The policy change, if passed, **would reverse previous decisions by past administrations and weaken a longstanding ban that had stood as a top priority for the politically powerful pharmaceutical industry**. So far, Washington lawmakers have offered no estimate for when this new legislation might take effect.

|

****

&gt;Trying to head off the U.S. government's upcoming move, **more than a dozen organizations signed a letter urging the Canadian government to safeguard the country's drug supply**.

&gt;**Diabetes Canada** was one of the signatories to that letter, and following Wednesday's announcement Hanson says her organization is now looking to Ottawa ""to take decisive and proactive action.""

&gt;""It's clear to us that whatever measures need to be put in place to prevent, for example, large-scale importation by online pharmacies or large-scale importation by large U.S. states, has to be put in place because **Canada is not structured to produce an amount of medications required for a population that size**,"" she told Lynch.

|

****

&gt;With major **American and Canadian drugmakers united in their condemnation** of Washington's proposal, Picard contends ""there's a thousand practical reasons why this won't happen.""

&gt;""A lot of these laws, I think, will be struck down in the U.S. **There will be opposition from the pharma companies there,""** he said.

&gt;""[And] there's no reason that pharma companies in Canada, **which tend to be subsidiaries of larger American and European firms, to ship to the U.S**.""

|

****

&gt;The largest U.S. **pharmaceutical and biotech companies** ... **opposed the idea of importation through their lobbyists PhRMA and BIO**, claiming it could have harmful consequences.

&gt;""There is **no way to guarantee the safety of drugs that come into the country**,"" PhRMA chief executive Stephen Ubl said.

|

****

&gt;Insulin has been a flashpoint in the U.S. battle over exorbitant prescription drug prices.

&gt;The cost of the life-saving medication can be as much as **10 times more per vial in the U.S. ...than in Canada.**

&gt;North of the border, a federal regulator, the **Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, is responsible for setting ceiling costs for brand-name drugs**.

&gt;As a result, **more Americans are making the cross-border trek as an alternative to paying thousands of dollars for insulin**. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently permits cross-border dispensing of up to **a three-month supply of the drug, provided it's for personal use.**

&gt;Picard believes importing drugs from Canada will create a litany of other problems in the process.

&gt;""We have drug shortages now for a variety of complex global reasons, and this would probably be exacerbated if it happened,"" said Picard.

&gt;In recent years, **Canadian drug makers have reported thousands of shortages — often because of manufacturing issues but also due to increased demand**.

&gt;According to Picard, **the pressure of these companies needing to supply 10 to 15 times the amount they're currently producing ""is just not possible.""**

&gt;""The ultimate solution to this if the U.S. wants lower drug prices, [is] **they have to introduce price controls like every other Western country has done.""**

&gt;Hanson admits she has ""tremendous empathy"" for what Americans face, but believes that **should not come at the expense of Canadians with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.**

&gt;""We also have to ensure **that none of these caravans — or more worryingly, large-scale importation of drugs from Canada — disrupts the supply of this life-giving medication**,"" she told The Current.",True,False,False,,0,1564721232,,False,0,{},evrx0uz,False,t3_ckyvh3,False,False,t3_ckyvh3,/r/canada/comments/ckyvh3/canada_has_no_reason_to_support_us_plan_to_import/evrx0uz/,False,,1573456754,16,True,[],False,canada,t5_2qh68,r/canada,public,0,

 Nos bastidores, eles buscam os caminhos para que isso ocorra. A procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, tem sido pressionada a determinar essa medida a partir de Brasília. Nesta quinta-feira (1º), ela chamou uma reunião de emergência para discutir o assunto. 

 Pessoas próximas a ela dizem, porém, que Dogde não estaria disposta a se indispor com os colegas de Ministério Público Federal. Com isso, o destino de Deltan na Lava Jato teria de ser decidido pelo STF.

 A decisão, segundo a articulação em curso no tribunal, pode caber a [Alexandre de Moraes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/moraes-do-stf-suspende-apuracoes-da-receita-sobre-ministros-e-autoridades.shtml), no âmbito do [inquérito das fake news](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/entenda-o-inquerito-do-supremo-contra-fake-news-e-conheca-os-pontos-polemicos.shtml), relatado por ele.

 Na noite desta quinta, [Moraes determinou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/depois-de-fux-moraes-tambem-pede-a-pf-integra-de-mensagens-apreendidas.shtml) que as mensagens apreendidas pela PF com os [suspeitos de terem ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/pf-prende-quatro-suspeitos-de-hackear-celulares-de-moro-e-deltan.shtml)[hackeado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/pf-prende-quatro-suspeitos-de-hackear-celulares-de-moro-e-deltan.shtml) celulares de autoridades, como o ministro da Justiça, Sergio Moro, sejam encaminhadas ao Supremo no prazo de 48 horas. 

 Assim, o caso dos hackers também passa a estar sob a alçada do Supremo. 

 A reação do STF se deu no dia em que mensagens [publicadas pela **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/veja-o-que-ja-foi-publicado-pela-folha-com-base-em-mensagens-da-lava-jato.shtml), em parceria com o site The Intercept Brasil, revelaram que, em 2016, [Deltan incentivou colegas a investigar Dias Toffoli](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/deltan-incentivou-cerco-da-lava-jato-a-toffoli-revelam-mensagens.shtml), hoje presidente do Supremo.

 De acordo com relatos feitos à **Folha**, os ministros criticaram duramente a [atuação de Deltan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/deltan-nunca-pediu-investigacao-de-ministros-do-stf-diz-forca-tarefa-da-lava-jato.shtml), que, na avaliação deles, passou a usar a operação de combate à corrupção como instrumento de intimidação.

 Conforme as mensagens, Deltan buscou informações sobre as finanças pessoais de Toffoli e sua mulher, Roberta Rangel, e evidências que os ligassem a empreiteiras envolvidas com o esquema de corrupção na Petrobras.

 A Constituição determina que ministros do STF não podem ser investigados por procuradores de primeira instância, como Deltan e colegas.

 “Diante de notícias veiculadas apontando indícios de investigação ilícita contra ministros desta corte [STF], expeça-se ofício ao juízo da 10ª Vara Federal Criminal de Brasília solicitando cópia integral do inquérito e de todo o material apreendido” na operação, determinou Moraes no pedido à PF.

 A Justiça Federal decretou nesta quinta a [prisão preventiva](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/justica-determina-prisao-sem-prazo-de-suspeitos-de-hackear-autoridades.shtml), sem prazo para vencer, dos quatro suspeitos presos temporariamente desde a semana passada.

 Conforme a **Folha** antecipou, Moro [informou a autoridades](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/moro-avisa-autoridades-que-mensagens-apreendidas-com-hacker-serao-destruidas.shtml) alvos dos hackers que as mensagens, obtidas pelo grupo preso, seriam destruídas.

 A comunicação provocou a [reação de ministros do STF e de especialistas em direito](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/guerra-juridica-deve-selar-destino-de-mensagens-apreendidas-da-lava-jato.shtml), que afirmaram que a decisão de destruir ou não o material não cabe ao ministro da Justiça, mas ao Judiciário.

 Além de Moraes, o [ministro Luiz Fux também requisitou](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/fux-proibe-destruicao-e-determina-que-stf-tenha-guarda-de-copia-de-mensagens-hackeadas.shtml) o material apreendido pela PF. Em decisão liminar, o ministro atendeu a pedido do PDT e determinou a preservação das provas.

 “Há fundado receio de que a dissipação de provas possa frustrar a efetividade da prestação jurisdicional, em contrariedade a preceitos fundamentais da Constituição, como o Estado de Direito e a segurança jurídica”, escreveu.

 O ministro foi citado em uma das mensagens obtidas pelo site The Intercept Brasil, que as publica desde junho.

 Conforme as mensagens, Deltan relatou a colegas uma conversa em que o ministro teria declarado que a força-tarefa poderia contar com ele “para o que precisar”.

 Numa [conversa com ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/in-fux-we-trust-diz-moro-a-deltan-em-mensagem-sobre-ministro-do-stf.shtml)[Deltan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/in-fux-we-trust-diz-moro-a-deltan-em-mensagem-sobre-ministro-do-stf.shtml), o então juiz Moro escreveu: “In Fux we trust [em Fux nós confiamos]”.

 Também nesta quinta, [Moraes determinou a suspensão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/moraes-do-stf-suspende-apuracoes-da-receita-sobre-ministros-e-autoridades.shtml) imediata de procedimentos investigatórios instaurados na Receita Federal que atingiram ministros da corte e outras autoridades. Para Moraes, há “graves indícios de ilegalidade no direcionamento das apurações em andamento”.

 Além da suspensão, Alexandre de Moraes decidiu afastar temporariamente dois servidores da Receita por indevida quebra de sigilo apurada em procedimento administrativo disciplinar.

 Em um dos diálogos, o coordenador da força-tarefa da Lava Jato em Curitiba sugere que recebeu da Receita informações sobre pesquisas em andamento nas contas do escritório de advocacia da mulher de Toffoli.

 “São claros os indícios de desvio de finalidade na apuração da Receita Federal, que, sem critérios objetivos de seleção, pretendeu, de forma oblíqua e ilegal investigar diversos agentes públicos”, afirmou Moraes.

 O ministro também pediu informações detalhadas sobre os critérios que levaram a Receita a realizar a fiscalização de 133 contribuintes e pediu esclarecimentos sobre eventual compartilhamento dessas informações com outros órgãos.

 Moraes ainda criticou a Receita por ter informado ao Supremo Tribunal Federal que se baseou em “notícias da imprensa”.

 A decisão ocorreu no âmbito de um [inquérito aberto em março](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/toffoli-abre-inquerito-para-apurar-fake-news-e-ameacas-contra-ministros-do-stf.shtml) para apurar fake news e ameaças contra integrantes da corte. Essa investigação foi prorrogada por mais 180 dias.

 Após a publicação das novas conversas de Deltan, o ministro Gilmar Mendes disse à coluna Mônica Bergamo que o [aparato judicial brasileiro vive sua maior crise](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/08/gilmar-diz-que-aparato-judicial-vive-maior-crise-desde-a-ditadura.shtml) desde a ditadura militar (1964-1985).

 Pouco depois, Gilmar voltou a criticar o uso da Receita e, sem mencionar o nome de Deltan, comparou sua atuação a “conversa de botequim”.

 “Isso virou um jogo de conversa de botequim, quando o procurador diz assim: ‘Eu tenho uma amiga na Receita que me passa informações’. Coloquem-se cada um de vocês nessa situação. Que segurança o cidadão tem? Quando isso se faz com o presidente do STF, o que não serão capazes de fazer com o cidadão comum?”, disse.

 O ministro [Marco Aurélio Mello também fez críticas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/marco-aurelio-diz-ser-inconcebivel-procurador-de-1o-instancia-investigar-ministros-do-stf.shtml) aos procuradores.

 “Isso é incrível, porque atua no STF o procurador-geral da República. É inconcebível que um procurador da República de primeira instância busque investigar atividades desenvolvidas por ministro do Supremo”, afirmou Marco Aurélio. Segundo o magistrado, “o problema do Brasil é que não se observa a lei”.

 As mensagens obtidas pelo Intercept e [divulgadas até este momento pelo site e por outros órgãos de imprensa, como a **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/veja-o-que-ja-foi-publicado-pela-folha-com-base-em-mensagens-da-lava-jato.shtml), revelam que o então juiz Moro atuou em parceria com os procuradores em diferentes processos, aparentemente sem a imparcialidade diante de acusação e defesa exigida a um magistrado segundo as regras do Judiciário.

I'm stating basic facts. We get a lot of US newbies here who cannot ride properly, asking about financing bikes, learning basic skills, getting into accidents - dozens weekly. The cause is simple, most riders in the US don't have the means or make the effort to learn how to ride properly, even when getting the actual license is piss easy. As far as I know a lot of Americans can't even ride a bicycle which is mildly amusing and shocking to a European, it shares all the basic physics of a motorbike and as such is a great place to come from when learning how to ride a motorbike. As a result of this inadequate rider training the accident rate for newbies in the US is insanely high and so are the insurance premiums.

Because winning the Prem (which is one of the biggest leagues in Europe) twice in a row with point totals of 100 and 98 isn't anything of note.

You keep repeating 'the prem' like it means something, it doesn't. City can't exactly go and win la liga can they? They can win the CL though and they've failed miserably so far. Let me summarise for you off the top of my head.

* Barca have won (probably) 7 titles over the last decade.

* Juve have won 7 (by your count).

* Bayern have probably also won 7.

* PSG have won 5-6?

* City have won 3?

It's far easier to make an argument for the other 4 teams being dominant *domestically*. Haven't Chelsea won 3 titles over the last decade too?

&gt;My criteria is you have to win in a dominant fashion.

...what? If city don't win the league for another few years are people going to look back and think 'gee, city were really dominant there for 2 seasons' - ignoring completely that Liverpool were within 3 points of them one of the seasons. Beautiful football, sure, highest points tally, sure. Dominant, no.

&gt;If Liverpool did that, they'd be one of the beat teams (they already are). But they wouldn't be dominant.

??? You're contradicting yourself???

&gt;What opposite argument?

I’ve been pushing Boris for PM for over a year: I said on BBC Question Time that Theresa May should resign, and one lady gasped. I said Boris should replace her and the audience booed. Well, they must feel very silly now. Not only is the big man in charge but Jacob Rees-Mogg, a weapons-grade Catholic, is running the House of Commons. Like a king.

In fact, JRM is already in hot water for having issued an etiquette guide to his staff that bans certain words and phrases (got, lot, yourself, ascertain and equal) and insists that men without titles be addressed as “esquire”. He also wants his employees to use imperial measurements. Cue a Lefty Twitter panic. It was easy to assume that what JRM wants Boris wants, and so the Government will be invading India next Thursday afternoon to reimpose the imperial ounce.

Actually, manners are nice and etiquette is useful: it helps us to navigate social situations. Ultra posh people don’t use it. They talk in cockney slang and refer to each other as “squire”. It’s the rest of us who need a shared set of rules to make sure we’re treating each other as we’d like to be treated ourselves, and this is a fact of nature you’ll find in every society, civilised or not. I’m sure even the cannibals have a code of good manners, such as “If you’ve got a house guest, don’t eat them.” If there was a problem with JRM’s list, it’s that some of the guidance was a bit out of date. Who puts two spaces after a full stop nowadays?

Never mind. The joy of JRM is that, like Boris, his Victorianness speaks to something we’ve been lacking for a long time: a love of Britain. Love of our history, love of our language, love, too, of our inventiveness. The Victorians are misunderstood as straight-laced conservatives, and when one speaks of their politics there’s this odd assumption that all Victorian politicians were intensely relaxed about the poverty and sickness in their midst. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was an age of conquest – of other countries, yes, but a conquest also of disease, exploitation and illiteracy, all pushed forward by a fascination for science.

Last week, Boris spoke in Manchester about space travel and genetics while standing in front of an engine designed by the Victorian inventor George Stephenson. That right there is the sweet spot of conservatism: it achieves progress while rooting us in a familiar past. That way, change doesn’t frighten us so much because it’s been put into a context that we feel comfortable with.

As with choo-choo trains, so with Brexit. The Government is threatening to embark on one of the most destabilising missions we could ever undertake, namely, leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. How does it sell it? By talking about future opportunities (free trade, deregulation) at the same time as invoking the triumphs of the past. Blitz spirit, Winston Churchill, “we’ll fight them on the beaches …”

It’s maddening to Remainers and sickening to the Left, but this cultural sensitivity is what has made the Conservatives such an enduring force. They have never once defied the tides of history or turned the clock back or, really, prevented any change from happening. But by using the right language – by calling us “esquire” – they’ve made us feel a bit better about stuff that’s well beyond our control. Boris looks and sounds like a prime minister from the past, and the past was glorious, so maybe the future won’t be so bad after all?

I spent a few days in Arundel, Sussex, which has a remarkable neo-Gothic Catholic cathedral that looms over the town like Dracula’s castle. Equally unlikely is the nearby English Martyrs Church at Goring-by-Sea, which resembles a bingo hall on the outside but inside is the scene of an artistic miracle. Sometime in the late 1980s a parishioner went to Rome and saw the Sistine Chapel, and he returned with the mad idea of recreating it on the ceiling of this unassuming church. Even madder, the Church said: “All right then.” The result is faithful, beautiful and overwhelming. Quite moving, in fact. The artist, Gary Bevans, was a sign-writer. He says that he didn’t paint anything, he just “held the brush”.

Arundel is a reminder that once you get out of London, many parts of this country haven’t changed for 30 years – thank heavens. My friend and I visited a marvellous print and map shop in the high street. The man behind the counter told me he’d had an argument with his mother and she threw her Zimmer frame at him. “Oh dear,” I said. I bought two 19th-century prints of monkeys.

What some people here are saying is that somehow the peoples of Africa are just not as equipped to deal with the massive civilisation development other peoples have known.

Because European imperialism happens almost exclusively to the detriment of the aboriginal population.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,[],"""nordic model"" is not a thing. China, India, Vietnam, Latin America have been pursuing exactly the same policies since 1950 or whenever they had autonomy. The reason why you do not know that is because the developed, Global North countries are able to extract surplus value from the developing Global south.

The thing the user above and I am describing is not called colonialism, it is imperialism. Imperialism is the situation in which country A can extract value from country B by capturing markets or exploiting resources (human and natural). Inside country A finance capital is created by merging of industrial and banking capital.

In this comment I will give a brief over view of the two type of relationship which the GN share with the GS, in the second comment I will describe how the relationship is perpetuated. The third will be the sources.

&gt; China in Africa is a big one right now

on the contrary China does not share imperialist relation with Africa. The Chinese debt policy is policy is extremely restrained and so small that it does not merit comparison, for example total debt to China in 2016 was 30 billion $ for Africa. And neither is China in a position to dictate the industrial and trade policy of lesser nations like the GS. In general most NDCs in the GS dont share imperialistic relations with each other.

How the GN extract value from the GS, and thus able to facilitate various advanced social democracies; can be explained through two distinct relation ships in commodity chains. Before describing these in detail heres a general overview of global Commodity Chains.

In every single global commodity chain as you go higher up three things happen,

- you reach countries in the global north, 

- the value added keeps on increasing

- the work being done requires much less physical exertion and labour conditions keep on bettering

#Type:1 The Arms length relationship#

Take the following three Global commodities, [(1, Chapter 1)](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Imperialism_in_the_Twenty_First_Century.html?id=Y_MWCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

- Coffee, is essentially grown entirely in the Global South. And 9 nations in the GlobalNorth account for 2/3rds of all imports. In the GN coffee beans are sold at a mark up of 400% on an average. Coffee at cafes are sold at a markup of 900% on an average. While a portion of that is swept away as capitalist profits, a larger portion is used to support jobs like baristas, workers in coffee shops and marketing; taxation from these pay for various state services. Globally about 3% of the final retail price of coffee is received by the cultivator and harvester.

- iPhone. Jobs from Apple in the USA are three types manufacturing, retail and professional (engineers and mangers). Outside the US mostly are manufacturing; when wages are compared that comes to 6%, 3.2% and 1.8% respectively.

- T-Shirt, this case there are more precise values. For 4.9€ Tshirt produced in Bangladesh (production including packaging) and consumed in Germany. The value gets divided as 12% to the capitalist; 20% to the German state (spent on public programs); 40% ass wages of German workers(post tax); 27.5% in Bangladesh (to be shared amongst the local capitalist, worker, and state). **In essence although the German workers do little to no work in this case they are allotted double the value of Bangladesh (workers state and capitalist combined).**

Expounding on the last example since Germany's population is much less than Bangladesh's. And also the fact that it can capture more surplus value, means it is redistributing that extracted value in a smaller population; thus have much more advanced form of social democracy than Bangladesh. Thus Germany has 4.2 doctor per thousand while Bangladesh has .5 per thousand.

#Type2: Direct FDI related#

In this case a country from the GN invests that is send actual capital to the Global south. Some from of technology transfer takes place. Countries in the GS compete amongst themselves to set up the most lucrative situation for Global capital (belonging to the GN) to help. In this case the theft of value happens through a general mechanism called price transferring.

As David Kocieniewski explains in the now infamous NYT article [(Source 2)](https://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/explanatory-reporting/04ieconomy4-29.pdf),

&gt; For instance, one of Apple’s subsidiaries in Luxembourg, named iTunes S.à r.l., has just a few dozen employees, according to corporate documents filed in that nation and a current executive. The only indication of the subsidiary’s presence outside is a letterbox with a lopsided slip of paper reading “ITUNES SARL.”

&gt; Luxembourg has just half a million residents. But when customers across Europe, Africa or the Middle East — and potentially elsewhere — download a song, television show or app, the sale is recorded in this small country, according to current and former executives. In 2011, iTunes S.à r.l.’s revenue exceeded $1 billion, according to an Apple executive, representing roughly 20 percent of iTunes’s worldwide sales.

&gt; The advantages of Luxembourg are simple, say Apple executives. The country has promised to tax the payments collected by Apple and numerous other tech corporations at low rates if they route transactions through Luxembourg. Taxes that would have otherwise gone to the governments of Britain, France, the United States and dozens of other nations go to Luxembourg instead, at discounted rates.

- Basically if the actual value is created in say China, the TNC reports the value to be created in any other country where the tax on the profits is lower. Thus they pay a lower tax while the Chinese population is denied any tax from the value it helped create.

The ""any other country"" are basically tax heavens, and this is just not Bahamas or British Virgin Islands but Luxembourg, Ireland, the US (certain states like Nevada, Nevada, Delaware, Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and New York). **Not only that the TNCs make these tax heavens compete amongst themselves to offer the best offers** Charles Teibout, explained this in his paper A pure theory of Local expenditures.

- Another more heinous form of Price transferring is called [Trade misinvoicing](https://gfintegrity.org/issue/trade-misinvoicing/). The most intricate analysis of this is done by Global Financial integrity (GFI)

From GFIs report on unrecorded capital flight from NDC's [(Source 3)](https://gfintegrity.org/press-release/new-report-on-unrecorded-capital-flight-finds-developing-countries-are-net-creditors-to-the-rest-of-the-world/)

&gt; The findings in the report indicate that as of 2011, $2.6 trillion of developing countries’ private wealth is held in tax havens, over half of the $4.4 trillion of total developing country assets in these same jurisdictions. Sub-Saharan Africa’s assets held in tax havens grew at an annualized rate of over 20 percent from 2005 to 2011, a faster rate than that of any other region either developed or developing. “There is perhaps no greater driver of inequality within developing countries than the combination of illicit financial flows and offshore tax havens,” lamented Mr. Baker.

Africa the prime candidate for the west's humanitarian efforts is actually a net creditor in billions of dollars a year to Western economies, when capital flows of the type 2 is added up.

As the most extensive GFI report studying the phenomena in Africa and other developing countries, between 1980-2009 found, [(Source 4)](https://gfintegrity.org/press-release/new-afdb-gfi-joint-report-africa-net-creditor-rest-world/)

&gt; the study finds that cumulative illicit financial outflows from the African continent over the 30-year time span ranged from between US$1.2 trillion to US$1.3 trillion in real terms. These unrecorded illicit outflows considerably swamped cumulative net recorded flows over the same period. As such, cumulative net resource outflows from Africa ranged from US$597 billion to US$1.4 trillion between 1980 and 2009.

Net credit is calculated after subtracting all forms of Gn capital outflows into Africa ie investments, FDI, foreign Aid, charity and all the other shebang the self congratulatory West prides itself off.",False,False,False,,0,1564749774,,1565626189,0,{},evsl59p,False,t3_cksvnr,False,True,t1_evq8f1x,/r/BreadTube/comments/cksvnr/i_guess_im_on_the_fence_between_socialism_and_the/evsl59p/,False,,1573468218,2,True,[],False,BreadTube,t5_iezap,r/BreadTube,public,0,

\- made some slow progress with **Trails of Cold Steel 2** and am presumably midway through Act 2.  I can only think of negative things to say even though it's not a terrible game; I sort-of enjoy it, but I think I would just like to finish it.

Actually, it's better to say it will be *broken*, not that it will break, because the ""broken"" implies an agent breaking it (and I think you can imagine whose interest it is in to break it), as opposed to the system somehow breaking on its own.

Medicare for all must be ***for ALL*** because then it is as **concrete as possible in the collective consciousness.** Anything more abstract than that can be gradually ridiculed, diminished, hollowed out, and privatized/profit-ized. 

Americans need a system to be proud of, and a straightforward (I.e., the ""for all"" part) system that all can readily understand and have an interest in upholding. Medical care for each and every person is such a system. But it must also be the only system, that is, there can be no private alternative. A long and steady enough stream of PR and advertising can turn any private alternative into a ""preferable option"" in the public perception, even if it is not the better system at a given time.

In one European example, Romania has healthcare for all, but because private insurance was allowed to coexist, it has come to be regarded as better than the public insurance and the preferable insurance whenever one's employer offers it. Perhaps they had the same ""revolving door"" situation that the US has, and some healthcare industrialist(s) managed to go over to the regulatory side and systematically dismantle the public system, while tv ads and politicians increasingly told the people that the public system is broken/failing/flawed/etc.

In the end, what you have is yet another individual out there skimming off the top of he pay of so many employees with this private healthcare coverage that should not be necessary in the first place given the existence of public healthcare for all.

She patiently accepted a decade of male academics sneering at her and much worse than that, whilst she by herself sought and discovered the means to access and demystify this brand new ""nuclear"" world. 

That task took so much work, and it appears nobody came close. The scientific community had gone wild for the discovery of x-rays, with the very best minds turning to it... but Marie set herself the task of smashing literal tonnes of boulders (which she had procured herself) into a fine dust to refine and refine over again, discovering, developing, perfecting the arduous method to purify the radioactive substances within a too-hot-in-summer, too-cold-in-winter shed in a courtyard.

That process was: sledge-hammer, pestle and mortar, bunsen burner, leave it a fortnight, pestle and mortar, bunsen burner... ad nauseum. A kilogram of rock pulverised to dust and carefully tended to for a month could produce less than a spoonful of radioactive substance, or it could easily spoil and become unusable due to the impossibility of keeping things steady in an uninsulated shed in the courtyard.

Once she had procured the prized substances as only she knew how, despite the mocking and despite the immense work (of entirely her own discovered technique), then she would happily give the materials to others who were interested in studying them (asking nothing in return). Certainly breaking boulders was no gentleman's task, but it's what it required, and she was the one who did it (besides the theoretical and technical brilliance to know what to do in the first place).

Finally then, when her work was recognised as marvellous (and I have skimmed the harrassment she received in an otherwise all-male academia), she had no use for this recognition at all. She hated to appear in public and rarely did. She had no word of ""I told you so"" to say, but it is clear whomever she was racing towards these results she outclassed them.

And so she became the first woman to graduate at a European university by performing manifest miracles (it required no less), smashing an obliquely opaque door and paving the way for the millions of women who have since enjoyed and excelled at higher education. She remains the only person ever to have received two Nobel prizes (and yup, in two different subjects), she did it without any favours, overwhelmingly from what she had taught herself and then pioneered herself, and at a time where an overwhelming and loud consensus agreed she had no place at all in a place of learning.

To me, (as a fan), her modesty is up there with her prowess as to her exceptionality. She never complained about her treatment and consistently shied from all vainglory. 

It is perhaps then very sad that being in a sense the patroness of women in higher education and sciences that for all those who have come through the door she opened... how many female scientists can you name, compared to the males?

**Dr. Dagmara Mrozowska:** For many years only in the group of researchers in Bohemology was known the fact of the Roma Holocaust carried out by the Nazi authorities of the Third Reich during World War II. It was related, among others, with romanipen principles - all Romani traditions, unwritten code of conduct and mutual relations in the traditional Roma community, which didn't include relations with non-Roma (gadjo). This was also true for the story of the Roma Holocaust. First of all, the Roma did not realize the magnitude of their own tragedy, besides, there was only an oral tradition between them, for a long time there was no such thing as the Roma intelligentsia, which, such as the Jewish intelligentsia, would talk about the Holocaust. They also believed that what had happened to them was not about non-Roma, so it should only remain between them.

Earlier, international public opinion did not realize the immensity of Hitler's genocide against the Roma. Compared to the Holocaust of Jews, this is a topic that is still overlooked.

**How many people have been victims of the Holocaust?**

Estimates on this subject are very divergent. The KL Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum reports that only over 20,000 Roma people died there. It is assumed that during Porajmos, about half a million Roma could die. Estimates are difficult because some of the documentation was destroyed, not everything was recorded, except that the Roma were killed with entire tabors in the forests during mass executions.

**To understand the mechanism of this crime, you have to go back to the pre-war years. How did the German state ruled by the Nazis treat Roma before the war? What place did the Roma occupy in the hierarchy of ""races"" according to the Nazi criminal ideology?**

The German racist doctrine, both in the Romani and Jewish aspects, first of all recognized the racial problem that needed to be solved. Jews and Gypsies were two groups condemned to extermination. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 concerned Jews, but they were also applied analogously to the Roma. In 1937, Heinrich Himmler, published a brochure ""Fighting the Gypsy plague"", on the basis of which, in the totalitarian state, the police began to collect all information about the Roma. An unfair stereotype of a Gypsy criminal was used.

Dr. Robert Ritter, who ""examined"" the Roma, wrote in January 1940: ""The Gypsy question can only be solved, by gathering the overwhelming majority of antisocial and unuseful mixed blood units in large labor camps, where they should be kept, forced to work and prevented once and forever of the reproduction of this mixed-blood population."" The Roma were sent to concentration camps in Dachau, Buchenwald and Ravensbrück.

One might be tempted to argue that the racist policy towards the Roma originated from persecutions that have affected the Roma almost since they appeared in Europe. It is enough to mention that the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I in 1725 allowed ""to hang Gypsy men and women, if they are over 18, even if they did not commit any offenses."" In 1905, the work ""Zigeuner Buch"" by Alfred Dillman appeared in Germany, which encouraged to deal with the ""Gypsy plague"" using ""merciless means"".

**The doomsday machine gained momentum during World War II...**

The occupation of Poland by the Germans and the establishment of the General Government caused that the Polish territories under German occupation became the scene of the genocidal tragedy of the Roma. Himmler ordered the resettlement of the German Roma and Sinti to the Jewish ghettos in the General Government. There were also Roma from other countries of occupied Europe and from allied countries of the Third Reich. In December 1942, Himmler issued an order that the Roma, including mixed people, living in the Reich, were arrested and sent to KL Auschwitz-Birkenau.

**What conditions prevailed in the camp for Roma and Sinti?**

The area where the Roma sub-camp (Zigeunerlager) was established in Auschwitz-Birkenau was marshy, covered with mud and clay, completely devoid of vegetation. There were 40 wooden barracks, a stable type. With subsequent transports, there were more Roma. 500 people lived in one barrack. Ten people slept on one bunk. Drinking water was provided in residual amounts. There was hunger. Hygiene conditions were terrible. The camp quickly became a place of disease. Typhus and noma (inflammation of oral mucous membranes) decimated prisoners. Scabies were treated... with baths in a solution of hydrochloric acid.

**Have the same methods of humiliating and dehumanizing been applied to Roma as in the case of, for example, Jewish and Polish prisoners?**

At first the Roma were not separated from their families, their heads were not shaved and their clothes were not taken away. It has changed over time. Roma prisoners wore a stripe with a black triangle - a symbol of non-Aryanism and crime. The Roma have become one of the ""favorite"" objects of pseudo-medical experiments of Dr. Joseph Mengele. Dr. Ewa Justin, who never took any responsibility for her actions, helped him in this.

On the night of August 2 and 3, 1944, the Gypsy camp was closed down. The Germans killed 2897 women, children and men in gas chambers, this one night. After the liquidation of the Roma camp, a transit camp for Jews was established in its place. Of the nearly 400 Roma children born in the camp, none survived.

**What is the memory of the Holocaust in the consciousness of contemporary Roma society?**

As I mentioned before, Roma were not aware of the scale of their drama just after the war. It was related to the Roma culture, the flow of information. Among the Roma, the trauma of the war was experienced individually, which is why until recently the concept of collective memory was something that did not exist in Romani culture at all. It began to change in the 70's. In 1994, Roma from around the world gathered in KL Auschwitz-Birkenau to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the murder of Roma in a concentration camp. From that moment, every year, on August 2, Roma from all over the world meet in KL Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Since 1997, August 2 has been celebrated as the International Day of Remembrance for the Extermination of the Roma, and on July 29, 2011, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland adopted the Day of Remembrance for the Extermination of Roma and Sinti on August 2.

Luke was right, the reason he fought the gods is because of what happened to him and other demigods. However no matter how you phrase it, revolutionary or not, Luke fought for his ideas the wrong way. He was no hero for most of his life. 

Just because a revolutionary leaders ideas are good, just because they want to reform things for the better, they are still wrong to attack those in charge to attempt that change. Look at some revolutionary like Napoleon, he was somewhat in the right, attempting a revolution to fix Frances problems. He reformed Frances banks and in a case more like Luke’s he created a legal code that is still used as a basis for French law today. Despite his achievements as a leader Napoleon is still looked at as a bad force, because of how he achieved his goals. Through war that killed thousands and the destruction of monarchy across Europe, destabilizing the content. Napoleon was a revolutionary, right in his ideas wrong in his methods. 

Luke is similar, if not the same. He had the right ideas, the gods forget about there kids and make them suffer unnecessarily. Luke did want to change things for the better but like Napoleon he went about it in the wrong way. He worked to fight the gods with a worse force than the gods themselves. Kronos wanted to destroy all of western civilization in attempt to get his government ruling. Luke followed this. Luke’s actions actively hurt demigods he loved and claimed to protect. For this he is not in the right. He is the same as Napoleon, doing harm to and starting war to try and change the way things for the better. 

One of the best examples that I see of him doing harm under a veil of taking down the gods and helping demigods is poisoning Thalia’s tree. Luke loved Thalia, and he tried to kill what remnants where left of her. By poisoning the tree he also compromised the camps borders and left all demigods there vulnerable to monster attack. He allied himself with Kronos to to protect demigods and left them in a position where all of them could die. There is no excuse for his harmful actions no matter how deeply you look into his reasoning behind them.

&gt; The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

&gt; The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

&gt; In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

&gt; In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

&gt; The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

&gt; In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

&gt; Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

&gt; In 2005, the band released ""A Bigger Bang"". 

&gt; On December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 years, entitled ""Blue &amp; Lonesome"" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

&gt; All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. The end. Read more on Last.fm.

Spain spent a lot of history being fought over by the Moors (north Africans and sub-Saharan African mercenaries) which has lead to some mixing there.

France is a bit less mixed in the south, with a more dominant Frankish/Celtic bent.

Italy is very mixed due to the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman Empire and the long and storied history of Rome's influence over Europe and the world - and that's without even touching in the Sicilians who are genetically distinct, or the nearby Maltese who are mixed up with Norse, Arab and French in addition to their own north African past.

Eastern Europe is honestly so confusing I don't even know where to start.

Northern Europe has seen much less movement of populations and so is more clearly Nordic or Germanic/Gothic in many places, although that's not to dismiss the distinct Sami of Finland and Norway, or Finnish's lingusitic isolation that implies a non-Indo-European origin.

=====

Por exemplo, xeretei seu post history, e tem um exemplo bem simples que acho que vai fazer tu entender meu lado.

Atualmente na industria de games, temos um claro problema de falta de qualidades nos jogos mainstream.

Acontece que no sistema atual de investimento de jogos, jogos mais complexos, conhecidos como AAA, ou a vasta quantidade de Freemiums, só serão financiados por VCs se forem rentáveis, desenhados em modelos rentáveis, em sumo, se o RoI valer a pena para os VCs.

Significa que ao invés de termos um mercado cheio de jogos legais, com jogabilidade boa, mecânicas boas, temos um mercado saturado com jogos propositalmente inacabados no seu lançamento, cheios de dificuldades artificiais para que as pessoas paguem para se divertir/ganhar, feitos para te viciar em gastar dinheiro neles ou ainda usando a força de trabalho \[desenvolvedores\] como gado.

Isso daí só vai ser resolvido se outro sistema que não visa só o lucro da produção de games for posto no lugar.

Talvez você não ache que isso deva ser feito, pois fere a liberdade das empresas e dos investidores de lucrar, ou que qualquer alternativa teria outros resultados piores, ou que o problema não é tão grave assim.

E tudo bem, podemos discordar disso, mas o fato é, que não é uma ou outra empresa boa que faz games de maneira mais ética que vai resolver essa situação, elas já existem, e são bem poucas, não são ações individuais que vão resolver nada.

Traditional STR testing works best with about 1-2 nanograms of DNA. This is equivalent to about 165-330 cells. The MiniFiler kit works best with between 0.25-0.5 nanograms of DNA (approximately 40-80 cells) and has been shown to yield usable results with even less than this amount of DNA possibly even from 10-20 cells. This sensitivity allows analysts to obtain results from hairs with very little root tissue left and ""touch"" DNA items those items that have only been handled by an individual.
Cases that can be worked with MiniSTRs

What kind of cases can benefit from MiniSTR testing? One prime area for MiniSTR testing is unidentified remains in missing persons cases. Bones that have been located in sub-optimal conditions, such as buried, underwater, or in locations with high heat and humidity are perfect for MiniSTR analysis. Typically these samples would be analyzed in combination with the traditional STR testing. Traditional testing could allow the analyst to obtain results from the majority of the loci tested, and MiniSTR typing could provide many of the loci that may be missing from the traditional results.
Cold cases can also benefit from MiniSTR testing. Samples that even a year or two ago would not be considered good candidates for DNA testing may now yield results with the extremely sensitive MiniFiler kit. However, one must take into account the condition and handling of the sample prior to its arrival in the lab. MiniSTR typing is so sensitive it is possible to pick up DNA from officers or others who may have handled the item years ago.

&gt;How would you feel if trump started tweeting demands for US court cases be stopped and the defendants freed? Do you think the judicial system should be overridden like that?

How would this override the judicial system? Im fairly certain trump has tweeted at parts of his own DoJ to stop certain investigations and they haven't been overridden. it's certainly not happening at the judicial level. Its certainly certainly not happening at the judicial level for a foreign country.

&gt;Would you be ok with foreign leaders demanding US court cases be stopped and their citizens released immediately because a famous friend asked them to help out?

When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is – and not in a way that advances our values. That's what happened when we backed out of TPP – we put China in the driver's seat. That's not good for our national security or for our workers. TPP wasn’t perfect but the idea behind it was a good one: to unite countries around high standards for workers, the environment, intellectual property, and transparency, and use our collective weight to curb China’s excesses. Going forward, my focus will be on rallying our friends in both Asia and Europe in setting the rules of the road for the 21st century and joining us to get tough on China and its trade and technology abuses. That’s much more effective than President Trump’s so-called America First approach that in practice is America Alone, alienating our allies and undermining the power of our collective leverage. My trade policy will also start at home, by investing in strengthening our greatest asset—our middle class. I would not sign any new trade deal until we have made major investments in our workers and infrastructure. Nor would I sign a deal that does not include representatives for labor and the environment at the negotiating table and strong protections for our workers.

SOME people have this idea, but it is exceedingly rare. 18 is generally the age that we're expected to start to work or go to college. We're expected to begin to learn how to take on tasks that our parents have been doing for us. 

It's just equally as common to find people who are 30 and still have their parents making doctor appointments for them. 

There's no general consensus.

In more expensive areas, like in Los Angeles where I live, it's too cumbersome for many people to live on their own. You can find parents and children who live together with grandparents and great-grandchildren. I have a friend that has lived in a duplex with their parents their entire lives. Even got married and still lives there with her husband and daughter.

In rural areas, where it's cheaper to live on your own, some people move out as soon as they turn 18. Going away to college at 18 is common, but those students often return to live with their parents after college. Sometimes they stay for a while, sometimes not. I have family in a small city called Tyler, TX. Rent there is incredibly affordable and many of my cousins moved away from home at 18. However, a bunch of them still live with their parents or with their partner's parents.

The US is a single country, but each state is like the EU member states. They are vastly different from each other in culture and attitudes. We are as large and populous as the entire EU combined. It's rare to find consensus on any issue like this.

 Pontes e Galvão se reuniram por cerca de duas horas na manhã desta sexta. Ao final, Galvão falou por três minutos a jornalistas.

 Segundo ele, o motivo de sua exoneração foi porque seu discurso em relação ao presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) criou constrangimento. [Em entrevista à **Folha** ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/posso-ate-ser-demitido-mas-nao-se-pode-atacar-o-inpe-diz-diretor.shtml)no último dia 21, Galvão havia dito que até poderia ser demitido, mas que o instituto era cientificamente sólido o suficiente para resistir aos ataques do governo.

 No dia 20, ao Jornal Nacional, Galvão afirmou que ""ele [Bolsonaro] tem um comportamento como se estivesse em botequim. Ou seja, ele fez acusações indevidas a pessoas do mais alto nível da ciência brasileira, não estou dizendo só eu, mas muitas outras pessoas"". ""Isso é uma piada de um garoto de 14 anos que não cabe a um presidente da República fazer"", disse o diretor do Inpe.

 “Diante do fato, a maneira como eu me manifestei com relação ao presidente, criou-se um constrangimento que é insustentável. Então eu serei exonerado”, afirmou, nesta sexta, o diretor, que disse concordar com sua substituição.

 Galvão afirmou que tinha preocupação de que suas críticas fossem respingar no Inpe. “Não vai acontecer”, ressaltou. Apesar de ter mandato de quatro anos com prazo para terminar no final do próximo ano, ele disse que no regimento do instituto está explícito que o ministro poderia, numa situação de perda de confiança, substituir o diretor do órgão.

 Ele disse ainda ter indicado um nome para substitui-lo com o objetivo de continuar sua linha de ação à frente do instituto, mas não quis dizer quem seria, por ser prerrogativa do ministro escolher o novo diretor do Inpe.

 Para Pontes, qualificado por Galvão como um ministro de “alta capacidade técnica”, o diretor do Inpe disse que não precisou defender a solidez dos dados do Inpe, questionados pelo presidente.

 “Ele concorda inteiramente com os dados do Inpe, ele sabe como são os dados do Inpe. Foi só uma questão simples de comunicação que houve e que nós esperamos corrigir. Nós temos que aprender com os erros e temos que corrigir no futuro”, disse. Ele afirmou ainda que a conversa com Pontes foi “excelente” e “muito construtiva”.

 “O ministro conversou comigo de um jeito muito cortês, e o que me deixou muito feliz foi a preservação do Inpe”, afirmou.

 A exoneração ocorre depois de críticas reiteradas do presidente Jair Bolsonaro e do ministro do Meio Ambiente, Ricardo Salles, ao Inpe nas duas últimas semanas por causa de dados que apontaram alta no desmatamento. 

 [Na quinta (1º), Bolsonaro ameaçou demitir Galvão de forma mais direta. ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/bolsonaro-diz-que-dados-de-desmate-foram-espancados-para-atingir-governo.shtml)""Se quebrar a confiança, vai ser demitido sumariamente. Perdeu a confiança, no meu entender, isso é uma pena capital"", disse. ""Eu lamento que alguns tenham mandato, não sei se no caso dele tem mandato ou não. A gente não pode tomar uma decisão mais drástica no tocante a isso, porque o estrago é muito grande"", afirmou.

 ​

 No dia 19 de julho, em café da manhã com jornalistas estrangeiros, [Bolsonaro questionou os ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/bolsonaro-critica-diretor-do-inpe-por-dados-sobre-desmatamento-que-prejudicam-nome-do-brasil.shtml)[dados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/bolsonaro-critica-diretor-do-inpe-por-dados-sobre-desmatamento-que-prejudicam-nome-do-brasil.shtml) de desmatamento. “Com toda a devastação de que vocês nos acusam de estar fazendo e ter feito no passado, a Amazônia já teria se extinguido”, disse. “É lógico que eu vou conversar com o presidente do Inpe. [São] Matérias repetidas que apenas ajudam a fazer com que o nome do Brasil seja malvisto lá fora”, disse mais tarde no mesmo dia. 

 O presidente afirmou também que os dados do Inpe não correspondiam à verdade e sugeriu que Galvão poderia estar a “serviço de alguma ONG.”

 [Ricardo Galvão respondeu aos ataques](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/posso-ate-ser-demitido-mas-nao-se-pode-atacar-o-inpe-diz-diretor.shtml). No dia 21 de julho, disse que poderia até ser demitido, mas que o Inpe não poderia ser atacado. “A única coisa que o Inpe faz é colher dados, nada mais, mas havia insatisfação sobre isso. Isso [as críticas] estava concentrado no MMA e eu não esperava que subisse à presidência da república, mas aparentemente subiu, não sei exatamente pelo esforço de quem”, disse à **Folha**.

 [O Inpe](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-resposta-a-bolsonaro-inpe-diz-prezar-por-honestidade-cientifica.shtml)[ também rebateu oficialmente todas as acusações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-resposta-a-bolsonaro-inpe-diz-prezar-por-honestidade-cientifica.shtml) feitas por Bolsonaro e Salles. Nesta quinta, o instituto divulgou nota na qual afirma que seu trabalho ""sempre foi norteado pelos princípios da excelência, transparência e honestidade científica"".

 Nos bastidores, o ministro Marcos Pontes demonstrava apoio ao Inpe e aos dados do desmatamento. A situação mudou após a publicação, em rede social, de um comunicado no qual o ministro afirmava compartilha a “estranheza” de Bolsonaro em relação aos dados de desmate.

 Em seguida, no encontro anual da SBPC (Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência), em Campo Grande, [Pontes defendeu restrições à publicação de dados do desmatamento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/07/pontes-defende-nao-divulgar-todos-os-dados-de-alertas-de-desmatamento.shtml). 

 Por fim, o diretor do Inpe deveria participar de uma reunião sobre dados de desmate que ocorreu na quarta (31), com Salles, Pontes e representantes do Inpe e do Ibama. Galvão, porém, foi desconvidado de última hora e teve seu encontro com o ministro da Ciência adiado para esta sexta.

 O engenheiro Ricardo Galvão foi nomeado diretor do Inpe em 2016 pelo então ministro Gilberto Kassab, do MCTIC (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações Comunicações). Na época, Galvão era professor titular da USP e presidente da Sociedade Brasileira de Física. Também é membro do conselho da Sociedade Europeia de Física e ex-diretor do Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas.

 Sua nomeação na época saiu com quatro meses de atraso. À época, Galvão disse acreditar que a demora não se dava por má vontade política, mas, sim, por uma questão de ""conjectura"" do governo. 

 ""Estou a par da maioria das questões. Como já fui do Inpe (entre 1986 e 1990) ainda conheço algumas pessoas. Desde que fui indicado, tenho tido conversas e já fiz um levantamento razoável dos problemas"", disse Galvão então. Pesquisadores especulavam que a demora teria a ver com um desprestígio da pasta.

 Galvão é graduado em engenharia de telecomunicações pela Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), mestre em engenharia elétrica pela Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas) e doutor em física de plasmas aplicada pelo MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), com livre-docência em física experimental pela USP (Universidade de São Paulo). É membro titular da Academia de Ciências do Estado de São Paulo e da Academia Brasileira de Ciências (ABC).

I’m not going to argue that socialism we have seen hasn’t sucked, but my counter point to that is we haven’t seen democratic socialism/communism yet. All socialist regimes have been led by dictators. Now you may think this is an inherent flaw in socialism/communism, but you have to understand that capitalism also operated under very undemocratic systems for a long time, and that time period was not “good” for the common people.


&gt;Colonialism/imperialism does not equal capitalism, AFAIK. That's one of the primary reasons that they have different names.

In my examples given, as well as the majority of European colonial history, colonialism and capitalism were directly inclusive of each other. Much of the colonialism was dominated and financed by private capital, for example the Dutch east India company, British east India company. Many Spanish expositions to southern America (Cortez) we’re funded by private capital. Countries used colonialism to acquire cheap resources and labor for production in order to amass capital (wealth). You cannot separate colonialism and capitalism in this context because they are basically cause and effect.

A imagem, capturada pelo jornalista Bashar al-Sheikh, mostra Riham, de cinco anos, segurando Tuka, de sete meses, pela roupa, para impedir que ela caia da montanha de destroços; enquanto a outra irmã, que quase não aparece na imagem, parece estar presa sob os blocos de concreto.

O tio das meninas observa a cena do alto dos escombros levando uma das mãos à cabeça.

Ele conta que estava deitado na cama, quando ouviu um jato sobrevoando a cidade de Ariha, na província de Idlib, na última quarta-feira (24 de julho):

""De repente, os vidros se estilhaçaram. Corri imediatamente em direção à porta em meio à fumaça preta e espessa.""

Foi quando se deparou com a cena:

""Eu só pensava em salvar as meninas. Só conseguia pensar nisso, mesmo que tivesse que arriscar minha própria vida"", relembra.

   Direito de imagem SF-24   Image caption  'Eu só pensava em salvar as meninas', diz o tio das crianças   Ao mesmo tempo, o jornalista Bashar al-Sheikh correu para o local do bombardeio.

""Corri para lá e comecei a filmar, para documentar e mostrar ao mundo o que está acontecendo com o povo de Idlib.""

Ele não conseguia enxergar nada a princípio, por causa da poeira dos escombros - até que ouviu a voz das crianças e do tio delas.

   Direito de imagem Reprodução / BBC   Image caption  O jornalista Bashar al-Sheikh queria 'mostrar ao mundo o que está acontecendo com o povo de Idlib'   ""Depois de filmar Riham e Tuqa, vi que estavam correndo perigo. Desliguei a câmera e me aproximei cuidadosamente, não queria chamar a atenção delas, para que não movessem a cabeça ou as mãos.""

Bashar al-Sheikh lembra que o tio das meninas fez de tudo para salvá-las.

""Ele não recuou, estava tentando acalmá-las, ""tomem cuidado, não caiam"", dizia ele enquanto tentava alcançá-las.""

   Direito de imagem AFP/Getty Images   Image caption  Cadeira de rodas em meio aos escombros dos edifícios destruídos em Ariha   Momentos depois, o prédio desmoronou, ferindo ainda mais as crianças. Após serem retiradas dos escombros, elas foram levadas para o hospital:

""Carreguei as duas garotas e instintivamente comecei a gritar 'ambulância, precisamos de uma ambulância, há duas garotas feridas'.""

""O posto médico mais próximo não tinha infraestrutura para tratar Riham, ela foi encaminhada então imediatamente para outro hospital.""

Apesar de ter sido socorrida, Riham não resistiu aos ferimentos. Ainda não se sabe ao certo o que aconteceu com a outra irmã que mal aparece na foto, identificada como Dalia. Há alguns dias, um médico havia dito à agência de notícias AFP que ela ainda se encontrava sob tratamento, em estado grave, porém estável, no hospital.

A bebê, Tuqa, sobreviveu à tragédia. ""Tuqa está em casa, espero que fique boa logo"", diz o jornalista.

   Direito de imagem Reprodução / BBC   Image caption  Tuqa, de sete meses, sobreviveu à tragédia   A imagem registrada por Bashar al-Sheikh capta o horror da guerra da Síria, na qual as forças do governo tentam recuperar Idlib do controle de rebeldes e jihadistas.

""A sensação é indescritível, nenhuma palavra é capaz de descrever esse sentimento, quantas Rihams serão necessárias para a comunidade internacional se mexer?"", questiona.

O que está acontecendo na Síria?
--------------------------------

Idlib, junto às províncias de Hama e Aleppo, é uma das últimas áreas controladas pela oposição na Síria depois de oito anos de guerra civil.

A área estaria protegida em tese por uma trégua negociada em setembro entre a Rússia, aliada do governo sírio, e a Turquia, que apoia a oposição.

Essa trégua deveria proteger os mais de 2,7 milhões de civis que vivem na região de uma ofensiva das forças do governo.

Mas, conforme a Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) informou em meados de julho, mais de 350 civis foram mortos e 330 mil foram forçados a deixar suas casas desde que o conflito se acirrou em 29 de abril. Número que cresceu nas últimas semanas.

O governo - com apoio da força aérea russa - argumenta que o acirramento dos ataques se deve a repetidas violações da trégua por jihadistas ligados à al-Qaeda que estariam na área dominada pela oposição.

Great, so were women and children going to become soldiers and pick up where the Planters and Government left off? I doubt it. 

&gt;That's putting the cart before the horse, historically...It was not a collective story developed through Southern experiences with post-war Northerners, but rather a top-down post-facto justification

Ok, so why would this mean that the reality of Sherman's march was ""cart before the horse?"" Either it happened and was especially brutal or it wasn't. Things like that become fodder for every sort of justification, not just ""Lost Cause"" ideology. Doesn't matter if people were piecing it together into something like that or not. 

&gt;TIL there weren't any capitalists in the Southern US.

That's not the point, though. There were more in the North, especially after the war. And they were from a victorious set of States while the South was not. And so they developed a poor reputation during reconstruction for that reason, which led to Southerners forming a new identity in reaction to that where they preferred their own over Northerners. This led to huge upswells of support in elections and solidified the Democrats as the ruling party opposed to Northern military and economic control over the region. 

&gt;Dude, slaves and slavery were fundamental to all aspects of Southern society and economy in this period. There was no Southern economy that existed divorced from slavery and slave labor, 

Correct. And there was no Northern economy that wasn't at the very least proximal to the Southern economy. Even Europe still relied heavily on Southern cotton to carry their textile industries. That's the point, no one was particularly divorced from slave economics, and it would have been great to give the South something else to do besides Plantation agriculture once slavery ended. 

&gt;I dunno, I bet the slaves themselves were pretty hyped to be freed from bondage and shit. 

They were happy, but they didn't have a great life after slavery ended. It required another century of organizing and attitudinal change, not to mention economic improvements across the board for the Southern states before they would have something that looked like free and unencumbered ownership of their own land and property. They often had to go back to the same plantations that they were freed from to perform the same labor but with low wages instead of slave conditions. Something that might not have needed to happen if other industries were better developed. This is a reason you see a series of black american migrations towards more manufacturing-oriented economies in the North. They didn't want to stick around in the same place they were enslaved, and they wanted higher wages than what the Southerners were willing to provide. 

&gt; It's not about ""feeling good in the moment"", its about fighting to win instead of letting half of your country backslide into reactionary slaver aristocracy.

How does that happen if you have freed the slaves and killed or imprisoned the slavers? The only worry would have been the roving armies that were dwindling in supply as it was at the time. It was a quicker way to achieve an end to the war, and it came at the cost of long term resentments towards the North.

Steve Baker who refused to accept a job in the Brexit department is set to be made chairman of the hardline European Research Group next month.

Mr Baker - who held the job before Mr Rees-Mogg - said that he will seek to replace him next month when MPs return to Parliament after their summer break.

Mr Baker's likely election to the role could be a headache for Boris Johnson if he seeks to bring back Theresa May's withdrawal agreement before Oct 31. 

Mr Rees-Mogg insisted that there was ""no conflict of interest"" in him staying on as ERG chairman for a few weeks because the policies of the ERG and Government were aligned.

Mr Johnson has repeatedly stressed that he wants the European Union to agree to remove the 200 page long section covering the Northern Ireland backstop in Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement to get the deal approved by MPs.

However this week ERG vice chairman Mark Francois said that Tory members of the ERG on the backbenches - now understood to be around 60 - would vote down any agreement.

Mr Rees-Mogg has been allowed to remain as chairman of the ERG even though he is now a Government minister after asking permission of the Cabinet Office, The Daily Telegraph can disclose.

 

Mr Baker told *The Daily Telegraph*: ""I can confirm that in September Jacob will resign and we will elect a new chair and I will seek to be the chair.

""Jacob has been a fantastic ERG chairman - a chairman for the times that we live through. If I take over as chair we will be looking to support the Government in this wonderful new era.""

Mr Rees-Mogg said that it was ""not an unreasonable assumption"" that Mr Baker will replace him as ERG chairman, but there had to be a vote of ERG members.

He said that his chairmanship of the ERG had been formally registered in the register for ministerial interests in the Cabinet Office as soon as he was appointed.

He added: ""There was no conflict of interest - the ERG is fully committed to us leaving on Oct 31. Peter Walker remained in the ERG the whole time he was in Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet. This is not ususual.""

On this week's [Chopper's Brexit Podcast ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/08/01/sixty-backbench-tories-will-vote-withdrawal-agreement-even-irish/)Mr Francois warned of a ""running Parliamentary war probably for at least a month"" if Mr Johnson tries to force the agreement through the Commons.

Mr Francois said that Tory members of the ERG on the backbenches - now understood to be around 60 - would vote down any agreement.

He told this week Chopper's Brexit Podcast: ""Even if you took the backstop element out of the bill you are still talking about a very substantial bill.

""You’d have to spend weeks in parliament \[…\] and you’d have weeks and weeks of people like \[Dominic\] Grieve and \[Oliver\] Letwin and co. tabling wrecking amendments.

The US systems that fill that same capability are sea-based and were not affected. Additionally the treaty did not involve our allies in Europe who could still threaten Russia with such systems they could develop themselves. The whole thing was an enormously bad deal for Russia.

Now the Russians were not following the treaty, definitely not in spirit and most likely not in the letter. I don't think anyone would dispute that, but as long as the treaty was in place, the US had a legal right to inspect Russian missile sites and it was a stick in the diplomatic arsenal that could be used whenever the Russians wanted to act in good faith or extract some concession from the US, such as getting economic sanctions removed. With the US withdrawing first, we've not only lost that stick, we've also given the Russians, known bad-faith actors, diplomatic ammunition to use against the US at future dates and free reign to openly develop weapons systems that, while they pose minimal threat to the US, do pose a significant threat to our European allies and will become a powerful negotiation tool in Russia's favor.",True,False,False,,0,1564768746,,1564769413,0,{},evtem8m,False,t3_cl2cl3,False,False,t1_evt97r8,/r/worldnews/comments/cl2cl3/us_formally_withdraws_from_1987_nuclear_pact_with/evtem8m/,False,,1573482192,221,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

Don't you think that's a bit of an unfair burden when I'm postulating international espionage? It's not like I'm going to hold up a picture of me holding a challenge coin from Fort Meade.

But yeah, I think that's fair to point out that I don't have evidence and your reasoning is all solid. 

Though the simplest explanation is that the ""leak"" was scrubbed of information that would influence American politics. Some data points for people to consider:

-  Mossack Fonseca claims they didn't want to take on American clients, exactly for the reasons you've outlined/quoted. Yet they had American clients, [one was arrested in 2018](http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2018/12/7/four-charged-with-helping-mossack-fonseca-clients-evade-us-t.html) and although a lot of it is unclear, the [accountant involved](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article222802720.html) was working for an American firm. The [Clinton Family](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article72215012.html) had a lot of shared connections, along with a whole series of other Americans. Just so happens that the information published has only been circumstantial in nature.

- Mossack Fonseca had two offices in the US. At the time of the leak, they were considered the 4th largest firm in the world for creating tax shelters.

- The John Doe who leaked the documents to a journalist allegedly ""cited income inequality"" as their motivation. This John Doe was able to leak email records and files of this 500 person organization. As an IT consultant, that almost certainly means a digital exploit was cared out targeting the firm's Exchange Server and SharePoint Server (or fileshares) and that the data was extracted via an eDiscovery tool or using Microsoft's Exchange eDiscovery tool sets. Most semi-technical folks could learn how to do this via youtube videos, but very few people in the organization are going to have the technical expertise to identify and capture the necessary credentials/log-ins for a Systems Administrator who has permissions to conduct an attack on this scale (2.6 terabytes). At minimum we can postulate that there would either be several dozen people within the firm who could have access to do this (with very few having technical knowledge), or some external actor (maybe a government, maybe a rogue hacker) who carried out this attack. Yet nothing has come forward - this leak didn't do anything about ""income inequality.""

- If we go beyond the headlines and look at the practical impact and results of the Panama Papers, [one of the first and swiftest actions by law enforcement was a big blow against the biggest Mexican Cartel, Los Cuinis](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/20160425-cartel-arrests-uruguay/). Sure this whole thing was embarrassing for a lot of individuals internationally and the boat rocked a little - *but who ended up in jail?* A group of Mexican cartel money launders working for the most powerful cartel in Mexico. [DEA was quoted](https://www.proceso.com.mx/400944/400944-se-hacen-visibles-los-cuinis-el-cartel-mas-rico-del-mundo) (spanish) after the arrest, in the same newspaper which [first reported on the connections](https://www.proceso.com.mx/436735/mossack-fonseca-al-servicio-los-cuinis) between Panama Papers and the Cartel. It also explained how this same Cartel was the biggest supplier of drugs to Europe.

Would it be possible that the DEA would use extrajudicial powers to commit a cyber attack against a foreign firm - a firm with admittedly few American clients - and leak that to a foreign journalist anonymously? In 2003 DEA agent [Jonathan Randel](https://www.rcfp.org/journals/the-news-media-and-the-law-winter-2003/dea-analyst-given-one-year/) leaked information about a British Citizen to the Times of London. The State Department was very unhappy with this and charged him with ""selling"" the information because he asked for $13,000 in expenses from the journalist. Season 3 of Netflix's Narcos revolves around a DEA agent leaking ~~[Guillermo Pallomari's accounting](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/narcos-real-dea-agent-chris-feistl-what-season-3-got-right-cali-1036466/item/his-link-jorge-salcedo-narcos-s3-1036439) documents~~ [bribery tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceso_8000) to a Columbian journalist to bring down the Cali Cartel. 

It's just as possible that an agency like the DEA or NSA could do this as some hacktavist who got lucky.

&gt; Not everything bad that happens around the world is the doing of the U.S.

I completely agree - the Germans have their own counter-narcotics motivations too. Though, they probably would also not want to rock the boat and leak data that implicates American political interests in direct wrong doing, which again makes Monssack Fonseca a great target.

Instead of looking at the sensationalized headlines, we should look at the outcomes and winners and losers. Mexican Cartel lost. Americans won both in taking down the cartel and not having any political interests at risk. Germans won by bringing down the Mexican cartel and identifying (and arresting) two German citizens at the heart of the issue. 

Who wins and loses in geopolitics is always really telling. There was no clear winners or losers in the Paradise Papers, probably because no geopolitical power wanted to see that.

&gt; A key international nuclear disarmament treaty has formally collapsed amid mutual recriminations between the west and Russia, and with Nato pledging to boost Europe&amp;#039;s military defences.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised Trump in a tweet on Friday: &amp;quot;President Trump walking away from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty is yet another destructive decision that makes the world less safe.

&gt; The INF deal was seen as one of two key arms deals between Russia and the US - the other being the New Start treaty, which keeps the nuclear arsenals of both countries well below their cold war peak.

- They were exiled from their lands several times which triggered mass migrations and then, as now, migration can cause resentment;

- Beyond just being different, they were amazingly resilient and despite marginalization and persecution, they kept their religious and cultural practices at a time where being different was often equated with disloyalty. That made them easy targets for scapegoating in the many places they sought refuge;

- Flash forward to Middle-Ages, technically, the Bible says your not allowed to charge interest... like ever (just like in Islam) and for a VERY long time European kingdoms observed that. However credit enables economic growth and economic growth is power so European Kingdoms would borrow from Jews because Jews weren't Christians so that made it OK for some reason. When the Kingdom would rack up too much debt, they would blame the bankers (Jews), have a Pogrom, and clear the debt. It also spawned a lot of really unpleasant stereotypes.

- Christians also blamed Jews for the murder of Jesus which isn't in the Bible but became widely believed which made things worse. 

Those feelings of resentment and fear of Jews have persisted for so long, they've sort of ingrained themselves in our culture.

&gt; Cameron Stallones began his musical career as a founding member of the experimental psychedelic rock collective Magic Lantern.  Soon after, demos originally intended to light the Lantern became the first Sun Araw LP: The Phynx.  Sun Araw blossomed as a solo project in attempted geosynchronous orbit with the Eternal Now: oblique six-dimensional transmissions from changeless environs.  Structural and spiritual inspiration for Sun Araw comes primarily from Cameron’s first artistic love: film and filmmakers, especially those invested in the long-take (Tarkovsky, Altman, Bela Tarr, Greenaway).  Devoted to long-form mantric music, the ethos is similar: straight lampin’ in deep focus, angle after angle on the melodic object, gaining strength from the subsequent breakdown of the illusion of fixed perspective.  

&gt; Since 2007, 4 full-length LPs, 3 EPs, and 5 cassettes have walked the mind-planes from psychedelic drone to melted afrobeat, from warped dub to minimal composition.  These releases have been praised in Wire Magazine (who selected Heavy Deeds as one of the top 50 records of 2008, and On Patrol in the top 50 of 2010), The New Yorker, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Uncut Magazine, Mojo, Pitchfork, and beyond.  Sun Araw has performed in the US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand with hundreds of artists including luminaries like Christian Fennesz and Konono No. 1.  In early 2011, Cameron and M. Geddes Gengras traveled to Jamaica where they produced and recorded a collaboration album with roots reggae legends The Congos, set for release in the fall.  While in and around Kingston, they also began producing dancehall singles and tracking local toasters under the name Duppy Gun Productions, which will be seeing release this summer.  Spiraling outwards along mandalic patterns, Sun Araw has become a total vehicle for artistic expression as Cameron creates the extensive artwork for each release, writes detailed liner notes, and has directed the music video for the single “Deep Cover.”

As others have already pointed out, that's definitely not what prompted the name ""change"" in 1935. Others have given some good quick explanations, but I hope I can give some detail about the connection between ""Iran"" and ""Aryan"" and its use by Nazi Germany. They are all connected just not because of the reason you gave above. 


Once again, others have pointed out that Iran is the native name for the country (an endonym) and Persia was a name widely used outside of Iran (an exonym). ""Persia"" had been used for the empires and kingdoms of modern Iran since the 6th century BCE because of the far reaching fame of the Persian Empire, created by Cyrus the Great and his successors, who came from the territory of Parsa. The ancient Persians were Iranian in terms of ethnic background and wider language family, and identified themselves as ""Ariya"" as a name for themselves, but the name of their homeland was picked up by the Greeks and subsequently disseminated into the wider European lexicon, where it remained until the Shah formally requested that the League of Nations call them Iran in 1935.


So, let's track the Iranian side of things first. The word ""Iran"" has *very* old roots. Somebody else talked about the word ""Eran"" being the version of Aryan used by the Sassanid Persians to describe themselves around the 3rd - 4th centuries CE and ""Eransahar"" being ""Land of the Aryans"" eventually evolved into ""Iran"" by the 20th century.  600 years before ""Eran"" was being used, the classical Persians were calling themselves ""Ariya"" like I mentioned above, and 400 or so years before that, Zoroaster and the other writers of the early Avesta (the holy text of Zoroastrianism, the primary religion of pre-Islamic Iran) were describing themselves ""Airya."" So, ""Iran"" can be traced back to 1000 BCE and earlier as the indigenous name for the people and place of the Iranian languages.


The story of Nazi use of ""Aryan"" actually also goes back to the Avestan ""Airya"" and it's connection to the Sanskrit word ""Arya."" In the late 1700s western scholars translating both Avestan and Sanskrit started noticing their similarities not just to one another, but to many of the languages of Europe. On one hand, this led to the idea of language families and the modern field of linguistics. On the other, it led to a frantic search by Europeans to identify the original source of all these related languages. The theoretical people who spoke this language were termed ""Aryans""  because that was what the people of the two oldest known texts in the ""Aryan"" language family called themselves. Since the word has been corrupted by Nazis since then, we call this the Indo-European language family now. 


Really, by the 20th century there weren't many academics still looking for an Aryan homeland in western and central Europe, but the mythology had already taken hold. The idea developed of an Aryan warrior culture that invaded and conquered land from Spain to India. This got wrapped up in other pseudo-science and philosophy at the time, especially in Germany, to eventually spawn the idea of an Aryan super race that Hitler latched on to even though actual science and scholarship had long since moved on by the 1930s. 


So ""Iran"" and the Nazi ""Aryan"" have the same ultimate root, but got there in very different ways. The former was the natural change of the word ""Arya"" from proto-Indo-Iranian language of thousands of years and the latter was the product  of nationalism and racist pseudo-science co-opting linguistic terminology. 


Really, I think JRR Tolkein put the issue very nicely when a German publisher asked about his ancestry while trying to publish a German translation of *The Hobbit*:

An interesting fact about a historical ruler in CK2... Baldwin I of the Latin Empire had previously been only a Count (of Flanders and Hainaut), but became the Latin Emperor thanks to his prominence in the Fourth Crusade. He therefore achieved the It's Better to be Emperor achievement IRL.

My most memorable run was probably my third Ironman, by which time I had started getting the hang of things. Although it's not the most impressive run ever, I was pretty happy with it. I started of as the Count of Forez in 1066, a vassal of the HRE. His dynasty would go on to disrupt the balance of power within Western Europe, the two dominant forces being the Holy Roman Empire and France. Over time, his descendants conquered lands within the south-west of the HRE, eventually forming the Kingdom of Burgundy. However, the Kings of Burgundy had no desire to stay shackled by vassalship to the Emperor, and nor did they seek to take control of the vast empire; they sought instead to forge their own destiny, and set their eyes on founding the Empire of Francia, which had once existed in Europe long ago. One King of Burgundy spread his political influence throughout the Empire, drawing various vassals of the Emperor into a faction for independence. When the time was ripe, he struck. The Emperor could do little to stop the numerous armies rebelling against him, and he was forced to relinquish control. It seemed a new era was dawning in Europe, and the growing Kingdom of Burgundy was the driving force behind it. However, its job was far from over

In order to get a foothold in western lands, one such King of Burgundy conquered Brittany, meaning that France would now face trouble on two fronts. After gaining the favour of the Papacy, the Pope officially approved a Burgundian invasion of France, which was subsequently won by the Burgundians. Burgundy had now usurped France's position as the primary foe of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the Burgundian gaze was now cast southwards, towards Aragon. The small Iberian Kingdom put up little resistance, and it was soon in Burgundian hands. Thenceforth, the Kings of Burgundy became the Emperors of Francia. Over time, with strategic marriages and lengthy conquest, Francia assimilated the entire Iberian peninsula, and also took lands in Eastern Europe during crusades. Even the Papacy was not safe from this European behemoth, as an Antipope backed by the Emperor usurped the Bishopric of Rome. What had started as a minor noble family ruling a small area of land at the extremities of the Holy Roman Empire had now become the bane of the Roman pretenders. The Emperors of Francia spent many years claiming rightful lands back from the Holy Roman Empire, leaving it reeling and crumbling by 1453.

Have Europe take them. There is no need to threaten Europe with the release of dangerous terrorists. Nations negotiate criminal transport regularly without doing this.

&gt;Who should deal with these European terrorists if not the Europeans and how should they do so?

Yes, the Europeans should deal with them. I already said this multiple times. But America does not have to threaten Europe with their release into the general public. Why is this hard to understand?

&gt;Europe isn’t going to let these people into their countries outside of prosecution. We all know that.

COunter-point: no we don't.

&gt;So if we don’t try to force them to prosecute them then who should deal with these people and how?

Maybe wait until they actually refuse (if they do) before you threaten to release terrorists into their population. That shouldn't even be an acceptable minimum amount of decorum, but sadly the bar is now lowered.

So I went camping when I was 13 or 14 with extended relatives (not in the U.S. but in Europe).

It was really rustic so the outhouses and everything else was really far. I guess I was cold and wanted to get out of my wet suit before trekking back to our tents.

The lake was completely deserted and there was a huge hill with trees in front of the lake, so no one could look down on me. 

So my aunt suggested I change there and she held a towel in front of me just in case anyone did come down the hill. There was no ""dock"" -- just a small empty patch of dirt, so I took my sweet time changing since I had to balance myself and didn't want to trip or drop my clothes on the wet ground.

Finally, 15 minutes or so later, once I'm finally done changing, I hear a bunch of clapping and whooping. Apparently a group of boy scouts (or however you'd call them since we were in a foreign country) were sitting in two large canoes hidden behind a fallen tree on the lake. Since I was paying so much attention to the hill, I had no idea that eight teenage boys were behind me quietly enjoying a 15-minute peep show.

[],,Trump4206956,,,,[],,,,text,t2_48f50y9k,False,[],"&gt; The US has had a foreign policy based on destroying nations for corporate profits since at least the Monroe Doctrine was established in 1823, when it was basically agreed that all of South America was solely for the USA to loot and pillage and for no-one else, something they proceeded to do at regular intervals.

The Monroe Doctrine is THE reason central and South American countries gained their independence a full century before the rest of the colonial world. Think about that for a minute. 

&gt; The US empire is a greedy, rapacious and murderous entity, and has destroyed multiple nations and murdered millions of civilians for its own greed.

Like all empires. Sure US has murdered millions but we also provided a peaceful existence to billions others.

&gt; one very simple and obvious example is its ongoing interference in Iraq, dating back decades.
In 2006 was the Iraq clusterfuck. ""Justified"" by lies, propaganda and 100% fabricated ""evidence"", it was the direct cause of over half-a-million civilian deaths, and caused at least 6 million refugees to overwhelm surrounding territories and Europe.

Saddam was an destabilizing force in the middle east. He waged war on several of his neighbors, funded paramilitary groups across the middle east and killed millions. While the US failed in the rebuilding process, taking out Saddam was not an evil act. In fact had Iraq been rebuilt properly you all would be clapping about the Iraq war. This is history revisionism. 

&gt; A decade before that, US sanctions lead to the direct deaths of over half-a-million Iraqi children, something that US Secretary of State Madelaine Albright thought was a ""price worth paying"". except of course, its always someone else that pays the price.

Was Iraq a peaceful loving nation and was the US sanction unwarranted?

&gt; and a decade before that, the US was supplying targeting data to Saddam Hussein to encourage him use chemical WMDs in his invasion of Iran.

US did not directly encourage him to use chemical weapons. US encouraged him to win the Iraq-Iran war, and he decided to use chemical weapons. Where did Saddam purchase those weapons btw? Because to this day Germany and France and even the UK like to pretend they didnt play a part.

&gt; I assure you that much of the fracturing of the current world, and the destabilization of South America, the Middle East, and much of SE Asia is almost solely down to the interference and greed of the USA

You should study history if you truly believe this.

This is ridiculously easy to debunk on so many levels.

They're making a claim about the written representation of Chinese. Written Chinese is *not* the Chinese language, it is a representation of it. The spoken language, i.e. what exists inside the head of the speakers, is what constitutes the language itself. We don't need to remind anyone that human language existed for tens of thousands of years before it was written down?

So the litmus test of the claim must be: have they changed the spoken version of the language, have they made it impossible or more difficult for people to express ideas that contradict the party ideology or the party? No, of course not. I could take any idea that contradicts any party dogma in English and render it in Chinese. So that claim falls flat on its face. What about the weaker claim? Have they made it impossible or more difficult to express those ideas in writing? No, written Chinese can be used to express pretty much anything that a Chinese speaker can say.

With everything the party has done against its people ranging from blunders to atrocities, this is neither. The simplification of Chinese characters had nothing to do with anything Orwell wrote about, and by and large might have had positive effects on literacy.

Edit: There are so many claims in that video that are not just exaggerated, but wildly inaccurate or blatantly false.

&gt;""If you can read traditional characters, you can read anything written in Chinese the last 2000 years?""

Of course you can't! 120 years ago, you'd have to know Classical Chinese to read anything written in Chinese, and if you go back 2000 years you'll be well into Old Chinese territory. You won't understand any of that if all you know is modern Mandarin. It's like saying that if you can read the Latin alphabet, you can read anything written in Western Europe since the Roman empire.

Just think about how few trades would happen in the NBA if that many players were off limits. We aren't just talking stars here. We are also talking about role players or salary cap ballast. How would you even match salaries on a trade with those restrictions? What about genuinely terrible situations for both the player and team? Do you force a player who needs a change of scenery to stay when the team doesn't want them anymore?

Frankly, I have very little sympathy for players when we are talking about this issue. They get paid enormous amounts of money to play in the NBA. I don't think that those players also need to have the right to pick where they play. It hurts the product and is bad for the long term health of the league, because it affects the competitive balance of the game. I am fine with having no-trade clauses, to prevent Blake Griffin type situations, but that's about the only concession I think I would be ok with from the league side. The league has to concern itself with bigger issues than the immediate desires of a couple superstars. Most of those superstar players would happily have traveled to Europe to make a fraction as much money to live their dream, if they weren't good enough to play in the NBA. I don't feel much sympathy for guys making ungodly amounts of money for being forced to live in a place like New Orleans for 5 years. If Anchorage gets a team maybe we can talk, but living in New Orleans seems like it is not some indescribable fate.

What I think they need is something a little more like the baseball situation, where teams get compensated when they lose high level players in free agency. If teams had to, they would happily give up a first round pick to sign an all-star. Basketball isn't like baseball in terms of the value attached to late first round picks. Teams are currently giving up a half-decade's worth of picks to get superstars, so there is a lot of room here, before you get into a situation where you are genuinely affecting the mobility of anyone. But, at the very least, it would be nice that teams wouldn't lose star players ""for nothing"". I don't think that a small market team like Milwaukee should have to decide whether to make a title run in 2021, or get a return for the star they might lose in free agency.

A franchise player tag, like in football would be another option. It would limit the movement of some players, but would limit it just to a single player or two per team. You could justify rules that allowed increased mobility for some players, as long as teams could be confident that they could keep their top guys. 

The franchise tag option would actually be a really interesting one in the NBA context, because it would divide the union between top level superstars and the run of the mill guys. If a fraction of the union's membership, who also happen to be making the most money, are limited in their ability to move to the city they want, would rotation guys feel super sympathetic? Probably not. If you could get a deal that worked for the majority of players, the superstars who would have their mobility limited probably wouldn't have the ability to stop the majority from passing it.",True,False,False,,0,1564781954,,False,0,{},evtzftv,False,t3_cky2cn,False,True,t3_cky2cn,/r/nbadiscussion/comments/cky2cn/what_are_some_potential_solutions_to_the_trade/evtzftv/,False,,1573492070,2,True,[],False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,r/nbadiscussion,public,0,

**1966**

The core of the Raumgruppe 1 watched as four metallic objects approached. Despite being test pilots, using every experimental jet that Germany had produced since the end of the war, they had not seen a MiG perform, at least up close. German aircraft were derived from the Me 262, utilizing two engines. The MiG only had one, and supposedly had more power to it.

As the planes approached, they came close to the runway. In a single line formation, they buzzed past before pulling up. Colonel Erich Hartmann smiled. The ones piloting them were clearly skilled behind the stick.

“Ivan definitely wants to impress us,” he remarked.

“Still don’t know why von Braun is allowing them to train with us,” replied Major Kuebart.

“They managed to put a man in space and bring him back first. I say that’s reason enough to bring them along.”

The four planes touched down, and a ground crew darted forward to service them. Ever since the Second Weltkrieg ended, the Russian Republic was not a member of European Alliance or NAVO. But, they were shaping up to be an ally nonetheless. They had a common enemy in the Syndicate Union, and now that the Space Race was overtaking the Arms Race, both realized they had an interest in ensuring an American did not land first on the moon.

The flight leader was the first to emerge and remove his helmet. The astronauts all recognized him. Colonel Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. For half an hour, though. Still being first was being first. A series of technical exchanges allowed the Germans to perfect their rocket designs, leading to the Hercules program which started to test various parameters of space flight.

Two more pilots disembarked. Alexei Leonov and Vladimir Komarov, both experienced cosmonauts. But, the Germans’ gaze soon focused on the last pilot, who removed the helmet to reveal long flowing auburn hair. The newspapers were not exaggerating. Major Valentina Tereshkova was exceptionally beautiful.

The four Russians approached the Germans, saluting once they were close. “Colonel Gagarin, Russian Air Force Prime Group, reporting for duty.”

Hartmann returned the salute. “Welcome, Colonel. That was some fancy flying you just did.”

“That was nothing. We save our truly fancy flying for the upper atmosphere.”

“Once you’ve been in a Vostok,” Tereshkova said, “everything else is like riding a bicycle.”

Hartmann smiled. “I suppose it’s time for the obligatory speech. You are all here for one reason: to walk on the moon. It is not enough to simply beat the Americans. We intend to show them that international cooperation gets you further than syndicalism ever can. Do you think you can handle that?”

“Sir, yes, sir!” the Russians replied.

For clarification, the UK declared that there is radical right-wing extremists- specifically, ethnic nationalism and nationalism in general. Currently there are 1020 radical extremist groups in the US. This section says NC, but you can just look at the overarching map itself, or investigate specific States, if you so wish. 
https://www.splcenter.org/states/north-carolina

The reason the UK designated that the radical right is now a terrorist ideology is because the growth of radical extremism has skyrocketed and because of a series of new discoveries in regards to their interactions and organizing with each other. Specifically, a radical right wing group in italy managed to get their hands on a French anti air missile. It is likely they gathered the funds to do this by collaborating with other nationalist groups AND governments to produce the wealth necessary to buy this missile from someone else. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48987723

The left doesn’t necessarily take a stance on border, but socialists and communists and anarchists do. They would see the abolition of nation states in favor of global collectivism where we all pool our resources together to ensure everyone’s needs are being met. They would collectively gather and share their thoughts and priorities and interests and meet those needs. Technically the UN has the potential for this, but the UN announces that it now has an economic forum. This forum is basically a platform for global corporations like google, Gasprom, AT&amp;T, hwawei, Nissan, various banks, etc to gather and discuss how governments should act in the interests of global and transnational business. What this signifies is that corporations have now bought the global governments and have secured a platform for global lobbying, not just federal lobbying. This means that all governments on a global scale will now officially be able to determine international law- something that heavily effects domestic policy. It is a threat to nationalism, but it is NOT a left wing ideology. The function of it is driven by profit. This is the antithesis of the entire left leaning political spectrum.


In regards to the tax bracket thing, I’ll just share this. 
 https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/

I cede to you that effective tax back then wasn’t as high as it is today, however, there is a difference between millionaires and billionaires. Inflation caused this. You mentioned tax loopholes and evasion. The Panama papers made it quite clear that this is done using cyber methods to avoid taxation and that crypt-currency is a major ball player here. There isn’t much that can be done about this other than the federal government explicitly seizing google and amazon by storming them with the military and demanding money right now. This won’t happen because when you have enough money to basically be a one-man National budget, you can basically do what you want. Bezos for example has a larger amount of money than most nations and States. He effectively operates like a tiny nation. Google is at an even greater degree.

You mentioned the left preaches financial security. This is technically true but I think you mean it differently than how the left means it. The left interprets financial security as collective financial stability with investments that have secure payouts. In a capitalist society with winners and losers, most are losers and crap out. The winner gets a bunch, but the investments in the States don’t go as far because of what the investments are in, which tend to be monopolies instead of startups and new research development. For example, oil companies aren’t going to invest in solar panels and solar energy or geothermal or nuclear because it threatens them immensely....well, until now. It was leaked that the oil companies have invested hundreds of billions into these things in discrete methods. 


You said that the left preaches noninterventionism, but doesn’t really support what they preach. To this I respond with the statement that america doesn’t have a left wing party. In fact, it has been whistleblown that socialists and communists were intentionally left out of government hiring and considerations because they were threats. The democrat party isn’t left wing. If they WERE, then they wouldn’t be billionaires and corporate puppets.


Dunno anything about city housing stuff. I live in a relatively rural-ish area. Homeowners have a set of rules for some people but most don’t have strict rules. With that said, I have been to larger cities and out of the country. So I understand how some city systems work, but not US government and housing.


As for monopolies and Rome.

Monopolies ONLY form when capitalism is left unchecked and people become drones to do work to survive. People should live to work, not work to live. The businesses that grow large by paying workers a small portion of their earnings that are not dependent on sales but on a person’s time is a scam and should be treated as such. But,it is too late for that now. The corporations grew so wealthy  that they exploited government workers and employees on a global scale that they have effectively bought the government itself. Government is literally just people. People are flawed. Give them the world and they will be indebted to you.



Your statement about supply labor and migration doesn’t hold true. People may have come to the US with promises of success and wealth, but they have been met with harsh, inhumane realities at the border, as well as competition in a capitalist system. As such, most who come do not work in lucrative fields. Most are poor as a result.there is a supply of people that is too large for the jobs that are open and too many qualified individuals. Apply the principles of capitalism
 And free market economics to borders, and people can and will follow the money. No opportunity in America ? Back to my home country or somewhere else. Follow where the demand is. Supply and demand works for human capital as well.

Intra-European trade created more value than had ever been created before during the late 19th century (whoo, Industrial Revolution!). The German Empire &amp; Great Britain, for example, traded muchly with each other and the rest of Europe.

And they killed 20 million people in a contest.

New York -- Wall St -- was incidentally the largest investor in post-WW1 Germany. Reconstruction there was rocky (whoo, hyperinflation!), but ultimately made a lot of value for the US (investment returns) and Germany (can't build an Industrial economy without upfront CapEx).

And then they killed another 80 million people in a contest.

I bring these two up because the global consensus pre-WW1 was that Europe was too tightly meshed through mutually-beneficial trade relations to go war again. 

Point being: the existence of a presently-mutually-beneficial trade relationship does not preclude a subsequent conflict. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a significant conflict that occured between two significant powers who did not previously have a mutually-beneficial-trade-relationship.

&gt; Without it, **once China takes over both the US and the EU,** they will be the ones to be able to pressure each of the other with the threat of restricting trade.

This sort of language really makes it sound like you DO see China as an adversary...you just think they should be handled differently.

But even then, it sounds like you are particularly concerned about their ability to attack Western trade (&amp; therefore value creation engines). I get that your solutions sound very different from Thiel's, but your original dismissal of him was that he was just engaging in ""trade war rhetoric""...and now you're saying that we will be powerless to stop China from threatening our ability to trade, and that this should be addressed via economic sanctions and strategic partnerships to restrict &amp; contain China...

Dead serious, the memes are good for starting debate.

First follow up, aren’t we already unified/integrated? Yes and no, we have a lot of positive axis of unification, all with their own technicalities related to individual member states interests. We could definitely go further, all in, with sovereignty to the continent, power at the parliament, elected government instead of commission, majority rather than unanimity, etc.

Second, would a federal Europe be better? Europeanism, like all continental ideas are about having a unified front, inside out. We could act more confidently internally with large infrastructure and legislative projects much faster, which would be helpful now for examples with issues like climate. Outward we could project ourselves more as well, be a more powerful multilateral alternative to Uncle Sam. Have more comprehensive associations potentially. 

Third, is it realistic? What are the challenges? There isn’t really a very comprehensive European dialogue, debate, political convention, etc. people are mostly aware of national politics, a bit into regional, and not very much into continental. There are many barriers to being literate in EU politics, ranging from language to institutional and program complexity. Most people had no idea who the spitzenkandidaten were, or that their vote had an effect on them, or what it was, or that it died, or who vdL is.

In summary, heck yes let’s federalize. We can’t deny globalism exists as it gets more pervasive, we can only decide how much power we have in it. And we gotta work together and compromise internally. 

It’s hard. Federalizing is challenging, you can either give Europe more power first so people get more involved and a continental conversation not centered around member states develop, so we can give voters more power (No more commission, rip technocracy), or you give voters more power first over a more powerful Europe and hope our first go at it isn’t set by an electorate who have no idea what they’re getting into apart from what their national parties tell them to get seats, we cannot federalize without transnational candidates, nor without a conversation that doesn’t favor voting for people who only speak your language.",True,False,False,,0,1564786406,,False,0,{},evu5tu2,False,t3_cl9yra,False,False,t3_cl9yra,/r/YUROP/comments/cl9yra/serious_question/evu5tu2/,False,,1573495111,11,True,[],False,YUROP,t5_2wivw,r/YUROP,public,0,

That's right, I forgot that European cabs are smaller than the American ones. That makes sense why drivers wouldn't stay out so long. Although I must say, American cabs are still very small compared to a home. 

My background is I got my CDL Class A license (I can drive literally any kind of commercial vehicle on the road outside of military vehicles) in December 07, 2018. I've been driving nationally over the road all 48 states since January 12, 2019. I've been in my own truck since February 22, 2019. I drive dry van (non-refrigerated) and refrigerated items. My salary is $0.42 per mile. I try to drive at least 2500 miles every week but sometimes my dispatcher won't give them to me or they're not available. I would say my average monthly gross pay would be $3600 every month. That's before taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I speak English (duh) and enough Spanish to be able to talk like a baby and get the general idea of what people are saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe with the shortage they will let American drivers come over and work there and not just limit it to the third world. I'm making basically the same amount of money that European drivers seem to be making, I would really love to go over there.

I agree that what's more important is NATO's commitment to defending itself. The potential Russian strategy I linked is premised on the major NATO members being willing to betray the Baltics in exchange for peace. A hypothetical America-less European alliance would probably be more likely to do this. Apart from being weaker the alliance would be dominated by Germany, whose population tends to be Russophile and pacifist. So yes, leaving NATO is realistically off the table.

Gold that was held in a nationalized treasury. And the Federal notes distributed as fiat were backed by that nationally-held gold. 

&gt;That doesn't change the fact that it's a single currency shared by weak states and strong states. Strong states get a weaker currency than they should and weak states get a stronger currency than they should, which is the criticism of the Euro.

Yup you're right. And that was a major issue during the late 19th and early 20th century. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was actually an allegory about how states with agriculturally-based economies were screwed through a gold standard. I believe William Jennings Bryant made this disparity a major tenant of his failed presidential election bid. What alleviated much of the disparate impact eventually came in the form of subsidies to farm states. In Europe's case, I suppose this would be something like Germany subsidizing the economies of, say, Greece or Portugal. It's up to you to draw the conclusion of how cool people in Germany would be without any clear upside of that arrangement.

&gt;It is, Europe was razed by two world wars and the entire population didn't want to ever see that again. The European Union is a direct consequence of that, it ties the countries together economically so that we are closer to each other and want to cooperate. 

Tying countries together economically - yeah definitely. I don't see how *forcing* countries into a monetary union without either clear institutional support at the country level or the mechanisms to support that monetary union translates into a lasting cooperation without serious externalities. We're seeing the breakdown now.  

&gt;Of course there is, 0. Countries are free to leave the union and be 100% sovereign. But that's a political characteristic, I don't see what it has to do with economics.

Politics and economics are practically fused into one. Name one major economic policy that doesn't have a political dimension in its success or failure.

**◤ SANITY CHECK ◢**

Do you want **more** out of your **adventures**?Sheogorath's following; **Fading Sanity** is recruiting disciples to join their ranks. Conquer challenging content **together** and enjoy defeating other non-believers! Whether you're a veteran or these are your first steps in Tamriel, you can stay sane for a while, but when you're ready for the next step read on.

**◤ ABOUT US ◢**

**Fading Sanity** maintains a delicate presence on the EU Mega Server as part of multiple factions. We have a small raiding presence but we also have a good sized amount of members that participate in other aspects of the game. 

Our goal in Elder Scrolls is: to have **fun** and play ESO as a team continuing to **beat new challenges** implemented by the developers. We maintain our belief in team first, members first, friends first while while maintaining progression through end game content and having a lot of fun while doing so. We are a moderately small guild and strive to promote a positive and friendly atmosphere, We are committed to friendship and are commitment to be a drama free and tight-knit guild.

**◤ WHO ◢**

We recruit **anyone** who wants to join, faction is not only AD, any faction members can join.Realise that we're a mature guild that also participate in the occasional mad happy hours and it would be a plus if you have a broad sense of humour (▰˘◡˘▰).**Family** first, we’re a vibrant community of people in all walks of life with their own ideas and interests. **Fun**means different things to different people. To some it’s PvP. To others it’s end-game raiding, still others might just want to kick back and be social. **RL &gt; ESO** \- We’ve got members in college, full-time jobs, families, or have to deploy into the military.

**◤ WHO NOT ◢**

We don't embrace elitism; Remember where you've come from. You're not entitled to behave arrogant and like an @#$ just because you've spend more time in the game. Hard-core raiding is also not our cup of tea, keep your DPS parsing madness for end-game progression to yourself! After all, we're a casual community.

**◤ WE PROVIDE ◢**

Fading Sanity is a **fast growing** guild. A portion of our success derives itself from a set of core values and laws that govern the guild. We strive not only to set an example in the online gaming world with an embodiment of our perspective that ESO shouldn't be work, but also to be unified and have fun! As with any successful guild, member participation and communication are key. Obviously we have an awesome guild tabard with which you can represent the face of madness on your chest!

Obviously I have hoped of another premier league title, but that's more wishful thinking. 

If we manage to snag Dybala and Bruno this transfer window, I doubt reality will be able to stop me believing. 

I could take or leave Mandzukic. As you say, he's no Ibra. That being said, he would offer a lot of experience up top, and would be able to help bridge how Dybala adapts to our team and the Premier League by being familiar with his style. 

As for Bruno, United are in need of a good midfielder. Pogba's a guaranteed starter, but the rest all get rotated. Someone like Bruno would be almost guaranteed a place, which means with the way we play, we only have 1 space to fill with multiple players, and would be able to find a trio that works best in different situations. 

I really don't want to give out any predictions, mainly to save face when they most likely come back to bite me, but if United do land Dybala and Bruno, and Arsenal get Tierney and a CB, I think top 4 would only have United, Arsenal, Tottenham, City and Liverpool competing. I can't see Chelsea doing anything against a more bolstered United and Arsenal. 

I kept seeing talks of some of the mid to top table teams, like Everton and Wolves getting a mention at being able to break into the top 6, but most people wrote off their chances. I'm standing here not confident that Chelsea will be able to make European football next year. 

Even though Chelsea have a decent side, the loss of Hazard, and a lack of quality squad depth, means they're a stones throw away from relying on youth if a couple of injuries go against them.

Don't worry. Relationship between a minor and a major are really rare and people aren't really attracted to teenager, it's a very exceptionnal behavior. Tought I do remember a 15 years old going out with a man that was something like 24. It's truly the only case I ever encountered.

(regardless of the fact they do not like NCT and SM is forcing once again NCT on them). Even Shawols don't support this. Even NCTizens don't like it. Like it's starting a fanwar and people are boiling here. I swear, the few friends I made during the EXO concerts the last two weeks are BOILING out of rage @_@ and since I know most Kai stans, they are even more disappointed.

The Holocaust is generally understood and defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as ""gypsies"" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. During the time of the Holocaust the Nazis also targeted other groups on grounds of  their perceived ""inferiority"", such as the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals.

In terms of how the victims of the Holocaust were murdered, the Nazis had six camps to which they refereed to as death camps or extermination camps at one point during their existence, meaning that they did not expect the vast majority of prisoners to survive more than a few hours after arrival. These camps were 

* the Aktion Reinhard Camps, Sobibor, Treblinka, and Belzec, which operated from the spring of 1942 to the fall of 1943. The main killing method in these camps were gas chambers operating with a tank or other engine producing carbon monoxide. Approximately 1.650.000 people were killed in these camps (600.000 in Belzec, 250.000 in Sobibor, and 800.000 in Treblinka), most of them Polish Jews but also including Jews from Western Europe such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

* the Chelmno (or Kulmhof) camp, which operated from December 1941 to March 1943 and again from June 1944 to January 1945. It's primary victims were the Jews held in the Lodz Ghetto, mostly Poles but also from Austria, Germany, Luxemburg, and Bohemia and Moravia via the Lodz Ghetto and the Wartheland District. The primary method of killing was a gas van designed by the Kriminaltechnisches Institut of the RSHA. Newer research has shown that the number of people murdered in Chelmno is approximately 320,000.

* the Majdanek camp, which operated from October 1941 to June 1944, albeit it was not used as a death or extermination camp continually during that period. Using carbon monoxide and Zyklon B gas chambers, Majdanek was used as a death camp during Aktion Reinhard as a secondary extermination site to be used when one of the Reinhard Camps either experienced technical difficulty or was operating at fully capacity. The second time frame in which Majdanek operated as a death camp was during Aktion Erntefest (Operation Harvest Festival), a November 1943 mass shooting of the remaining Jews in Lublin District. During Aktion Erntefest 43.000 Jews were shot in or near the Majdanek Camp in one day. The total number of people murdered in Majdanek is approximately 80.000.

* and finally, the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, which after the conclusion of Operation Reinhard in the fall of 1943 and until the commencement of operations in Chelmno in June 1944 was the sole Nazi death camp. While gassing actions had taken place in Auschwitz I Stammlager in September 1941 and continued on a smaller scale throughout the camps existence, Auschwitz-Birkenau was to become one of the major sites for the Holocaust. The first Zyklon B gas chambers were operational by March 1942 but in early 1943, the Nazi administration decided to expand the camp and designate it as the primary killing site for Jews outside of the Polish districts affected by Operation Reinhard. Whole national communities of Jews such as the Greek and Hungarian Jews were gassed in Auschwitz and the total number of deaths is approximately 1.1 million.

Next to these camps where with approximately 3 million Jews murdered about half of the Jewish victims – and in the case of Auschwitz and Chelmno, the vast majority of the Roma and Sinti – of the Holocaust were murdered, there existed a couple of smaller camps that also can be subsumed under the moniker of death camp. These are the Maly Trostinecz camp near Minsk, where the Jews of Minsk, including several thousand deported there from Germany and Austria were killed and the Sajmiste camp near Belgrad where the the female, underage and senior Jews of Serbia were murdered by gas van in early 1942. In Maly Trostinecz between 40.000 and 60.000 Jews were killed and in Sajmiste around 10.000 Jews were killed.

Maly Trostinecz is a very good example of a camp that was known to have existed immediately after the war but where its function as a death camp is a relatively recent discovery due to the opening of the Russian archives. Due to material produced by Sonderkommando 1005, the unit in charge of opening mass graves and burning the bodies, that was kept in the Russian Special Archive of collected German material have historians been able to reconstruct Maly Trostinecz history as a death camp.

So as to the question if we know about the Nazi death camps, we do for certain about the eight mentioned above, it is however not impossible that material might still surface in Eastern European archives that shows that there were more.

Next to the death camps, one major cause of death for the victims of the Holocaust were mass executions carried out by the Einsatzgruppen. Operating in the Soviet Union from June 1941, these units comprised of members of the SS, the Police, and Gestapo. Through the reports they regularly send back to Berlin, the Einsatzmeldungen UdSSR, we know that they killed at least 2 million people, 1.3 million of them Jews.

Other reasons of death were murder by one of the various police units, being worked to death in a camp and Ghetto, starvation, disease, and death marches. Through various means of calculation, including documentation by the Nazis, comparing population statistics where available from before and after the war and physical evidence, we arrive at the following table

*Point 2*

This is more difficult to answer because of the question of how to define a Holocaust survivor. Are German Jews who emigrated before 1939 Holocaust survivors? Are people who escaped a Ghetto in Poland or the Soviet Union in 1941 and remained with the Partisans for the remainder of the war Holocaust survivors? Going by the broadest definition of a person persecuted as Jewish and living in area controlled or occupied by the Nazis or one of their collaborators and living through the war until May 1945, there were – according to the estimated pre-war population as laid out in the table above – 2.927.878 Holocaust survivors in May 1945. More difficult to know is the number of Holocaust survivors still alive today. The numbers vary greatly, depending on the definition applied. The Claims Conference just this year [published numbers](http://time.com/4392413/elie-wiesel-holocaust-survivors-remaining/) that about 100.000 Jews who had been in a camp, a Ghetto or in hiding during the war are alive in 2016. Applying the above definition, which includes Jews from Denmark brought to Sweden, Jews emigrating from Germany before 1941, and groups like the Jews of Finland living out the war there, the number of Holocaust survivors still alive is somewhere around 400.000 (including the above mentioned 100.000) or about 7,25%.

Applying Western European normal population statistics for an age group older than 76, that is a realistic number and even a bit low (13,2% of the EU population is between 70 and 79 and 5,2% is older than 80 in 2015 according to [official statistics](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Population_structure_by_major_age_groups,_EU-28,_2015%E2%80%9380_(%C2%B9)_(%25_of_total_population)_YB16.png).)

# Brazil Official Is Ousted After He Reports Rising Amazon Deforestation

## President Jair Bolsonaro called data showing an 88% annual rise in Amazonian deforestation a lie, without evidence to support his claim

Updated Aug. 2, 2019 6:50 pm ET

BRASÍLIA—Brazil’s government ousted the chief of the agency that tracks deforestation after President Jair Bolsonaro accused him of lying about rising levels of [Amazonian destruction](https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-small-ranchers-big-role-in-saving-brazils-amazon-1526734800?mod=article_inline).

Physicist Ricardo Galvão was removed from the respected National Space Research Agency, known as Inpe, which last month revealed preliminary data based on satellite images showing an 88% annual increase in deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon.

Mr. Bolsonaro had called the numbers a lie, without providing evidence to back his claim.

“With all the devastation that \[critics\] are accusing us of doing... the Amazon region would already have been extinguished,” Mr. Bolsonaro said last month.

In response, Mr. Galvão said in a TV interview on July 20 that Mr. Bolsonaro isn’t qualified to question Inpe’s data.

On Thursday, Mr. Bolsonaro again pushed back against the rise, saying the figures are incorrect and that if Mr. Galvão had released erroneous figures he would be fired. By Friday, Mr. Galvão’s said his position had become untenable.

“It created an unbearable embarrassment, so I will be dismissed,” the MIT-educated physicist told reporters after meeting with his boss, Marcos Pontes, the science and technology minister.

Mr. Bolsonaro, a pro-business leader who has tried to boost economic activity in the Amazon, has bashed environmental activism as a plot to keep Brazil from exploiting the rain forest’s natural resources.

The president, an ally of Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector, accuses authorities of excessively prosecuting farmers and miners in the jungle.

Some experts say Mr. Bolsonaro’s rhetoric is causing a new rise in deforestation.

“The president is irked by the deforestation figures, but it’s happening exactly because of his anti-environmental agenda,” said Gustavo Baptista, a satellite-imagery professor at University of Brasília. “If you say you’re going to loosen environmental enforcement, people will exploit the jungle more easily.”

Inpe estimated that 370 square miles of Amazonian forest were lost in June, an 88% increase from the same month a year earlier. The agency said April-to-June deforestation was 24.8% higher than the same period last year. Inpe sends alerts with such data to environmental authorities to help them contain the damage. Sixty percent of the Amazon is in Brazil, where it covers nearly half of the country’s territory.

The rise in deforestation coincides with the June-to-September dry season that makes it easier to cut down and burn trees. The cloud-free skies also permit clear satellite images. Deforestation is largely the work of illegal miners, loggers and farmers and ranchers who expand their soy fields and pastures into the jungle.

Amazonian destruction was far higher decades ago before it declined for years. It began to rise again in 2015.

Scientists link deforestation in the world’s biggest rain forest to climate change and environmental ills such as [an explosion of sargassum algae ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-brown-rotten-and-smelly-mexico-wishes-it-didnt-know-11564225200?mod=article_inline)across the Caribbean that puts ecosystems at risk.

Mr. Pontes said last week that Mr. Bolsonaro’s reaction to Inpe’s latest data was understandable. But he expressed confidence in the accuracy of Inpe’s data. Mr. Pontes said he had asked for a more detailed report from Inpe to better understand the data.

The wrangling over the data could complicate relations with the European Union, where some officials oppose a new trade deal with Brazil and other South American countries because of concerns over deforestation.

“France has made it clear that environmental issues are crucial” to advance the trade deal with Europe, said Thiago de Aragão, a foreign-policy consultant in Brasília. “If we have an environmental narrative that’s not well received overseas, this could slow down the progress of the EU deal.”

The Bolsonaro administration has said Brazil has sound environmental policies and that trade agreements aren’t at risk because of them.",True,False,False,,0,1564799226,,1564799420,0,{},evum752,True,t3_cldflg,False,True,t3_cldflg,/r/climateskeptics/comments/cldflg/brazil_official_is_ousted_after_he_reports_rising/evum752/,False,,1573503000,2,True,[],False,climateskeptics,t5_2qk5q,r/climateskeptics,public,0,

Again, I do not share the same pessimism about the early date of Avestan texts and accept the philological consensus among a growing number of historical linguists and Avestan scholars that OAv and YAv texts were composed many centuries before the Sassanid era. 

**The text**.  Of course,  Avestan research pales in comparison to the study of biblical texts (as it is a small field) and an enormous amount of work remains to be done in putting together a new critical text and resolving the many corruptions. I don't mean to compare the two. What I mean is that indeed there has been a lot of literary and linguistic research in the past few decades (with important contributions by Jean Kellens, Almut Hintze, Alberto Cantera, Antonio Panaino, P.O. Skjærvø, Michiel de Vaan, among others) that has led to newer understandings of the composition of the Avesta. In contrast to the older theory that it is a mishmash of fragments from the Great Avesta assembled in the Sassanid period, with the majority of the text lost, the current view is that the Dēnkard Avesta was a compilation of Avestan texts with Pahlavi translation and exposition while the extant Avesta is a separate collection of mainly liturgical texts with just a few inclusions from the Dēnkard Avesta (e.g. the Vidēvdād and the Nērangestān). In particular, the Long Liturgy (as found in the Yasna and other texts) is a coherent ritual text that was arranged around older OAv material in pre-Sassanid times (with its structure and arrangement known in other YAv texts), rather than being a unstructured concatenation of fragments redacted during a time when Avestan was no longer spoken. In other words, we have in the Avesta the earlier and more important liturgical texts while later exegetical compositions were more often lost or subject to scribal corruption (lacking the living memory inherent in liturgical performance). My main point in my prior post however is that the vast linguistic differences between OAv, YAv, and Pahlavi permit a far more robust literary stratification of texts in the Avesta than, say, a biblical scholar would attempt using stylistic criteria and the slighter differences between Classical Biblical Hebrew and Late Biblical Hebrew. And so Kellens attempts a relative chronology of how the Yasna grew as a piece of ritually performed literature.

**The chronological horizon of OAv and YAv texts**.  To get to the heart of the matter, whether you regard the Avesta as a rolling corpus that was largely canonized by YAv speakers, or as a jumble of texts assembled together by later Middle Persian speakers, the *composition* of OAv and YAv texts themselves could not have been done in the Sassanid era when the writing system was adopted. By that time Avestan had long ceased to be a living language and was understood only via the translations and expository texts that had already been produced (which reflect an imperfect knowledge of OAv and YAv). Rather the alphabet was a sort of phonetic notation for exactly preserving the proper pronunciation of what was only a liturgical language. So the ideas in the OAv and YAv (irrespective of later oral and scribal corruption) certainly belong to an earlier era; the Pahlavi expository texts meanwhile reflect a later stage in theological development. Moreover scholars believe that the individual texts (such as the Long Liturgy) were fossilized and achieved stability (crystallization) before the languages became extinct as native tongues. De Vaan and other specialists believe that 300 BC ""would mark the definite end of the period when new YAv. texts could be composed, or old texts adjusted by the redactors"" (*Avestan Vowels*, 2003, p. 13).

Of course, the dating of Avestan texts beyond this is largely conjectural but there are good reasons why nearly all contemporary scholars date OAv to ca. 1200-1000 BC. YAv shows about the same amount of development from Proto-Iranian (usually dated around 1500 BC) as Old Persian, and so they are generally thought to have been roughly contemporaneous languages; the close similarity between OAv and Vedic Sanskrit meanwhile points to a time of composition not far removed from Proto-Iranian. For example, Proto-IE laryngeals were generally lost in the first millennium BC throughout all Indo-European languages (with various effects such as the coloring of vowels), but in OAv they are maintained intervocalically via the laryngeal hiatus which was likely a glottal stop. This occurs also in Vedic Sanskrit but scholars note that it is done much more consistently in OAv. Laryngeal hiatus is an archaic feature of OAv; laryngeals were fully lost in the Old Persian of the Achaemenid era and in YAv texts as well. As Benjamin Fortson explains the OAv text preserves ""a stage from a time before the common ancestor of Avestan and Old Persian split"" (*Indo-European Language and Culture*, 2011, p. 231). Also OAv preserves PIE ablaut and inflections lost in both Vedic Sanskrit and YAv; YAv meanwhile developed its own grammatical features. At the same time, the Gathas were ritually performed into YAv times before the text crystallized (after OAv ceased as a spoken language), which de Vaan dates to around 800-600 BC.  Pseudo-OAv redactions suggests that OAv was no longer a living language. The very different stages in the language require that a span of several centuries must intervene between the crystallization of the OAv and YAv texts. Meanwhile Karl Hoffmann showed that YAv retains pronunciations from Old Persian that were lost in Middle Persian. Almut Hintze notes that this means that ""the Avesta was already being recited in Persis during the Achaemenid period and there is a continuity of tradition from that time throughout the Parthian and Sasanian periods"" (*Das Partherreich und Seine Zeugnisse*, 1998, p. 154)

**Zoroastrianism in the Achaemenid period?**  Although the Avesta shows signs of having undergone Old Persian transmission, it could not have originated solely in an Achaemenid milieu. Otherwise it would have been composed in Old Persian; Avestan is an eastern Iranian language, so the religious tradition is probably older and originated outside of a southwestern Persian context. Almut Hintze shows that YAv shares isoglosses with other Iranian languages in the southeast and northeast (such as Sogdian) and the YAv itself contains geographical references to Sogdiana, Margiana, Bactria, Herat, Arachosia, and the Helmand river (Yt. 13.143; Yt. 19.67; V. 1.1) – nothing whatsoever in western Iran; nor does the Avesta contain any references to the Median or Achaemenid empires. There is also potential archaeological evidence in the Yaz culture of Margiana, Bactria, and Sogdia (1500-500 BC), which show a near complete lack of burials – a feature consistent with Avestan practices.

The Avestan evidence suggests two main phases in early Zoroastrianism. The OAv period in the late second millennium BC was imo an anti-*daēuua* movement in the Margiana-Sogdia region (promoting the ahuras and yazatas as gods worthy of worship over other traditional gods), with the Medes and Persians inheriting this rejection of *daeva*s. In all Iranian languages *daeva* has derogatory meaning and OP has a neologism *bag* (&lt; ""assign, allot"") for ""god"" which indicates an early avoidance of *daevas*. Then in the YAv period a more developed form of the religion (which saw the *daeva*s as demons led by Aŋra Mainyu) arose in southeast Iran (Sistan?) which penetrated Media and Persia by the sixth century BC. A western form of this cult then arose in the Achaemenid period. Jean Kellens pointed out that Achaemenid royal names (Darius, Artaxerxes, Vahyazdata, possibly even Achaemenes) were allusive of sayings in the Gathas (e.g. *ašā xšaθrəmcā* in Y. 29.10 as the model for OP *artaxšac̨a*; cf. also the YAv version in Y. 20.3). The most interesting example is that of Darius: *dārayavau* ""holding firm the good (thought)"" has the model of *dāraiiaṯ vahištəm (manō)* in Y. 31.7 and the word for ""good"" is the Avestan term and not *naiba* which was the OP equivalent. Darius' father also was named Vištāspa, the name of Zoroaster's patron in the Avesta, and it is clearly a borrowing from Avestan or Median (as it lacks OP sound changes), and his wife Atossa bears the name of Vištāspa's wife Hutaosā in the Avesta. This contrasts with that of the Teispids, who were likely Elamite (Cyrus, king of Anshan), and thus it is not surprising to find a lack of Zoroastrian affinities in the inscriptions and onomastics of Cyrus and Cambyses (who in contemporary scholarship are distinguished from the Achaemenids). Skjærvø also draws attention to Xerxes' Daiva inscription which clusters together different technical terms and ideas found in YAv passages (XPh 46-56). The ""triad"" of Artaxerxes II corresponds to the three ahuras in the YAv, with Anahita supplanting Apam Napat (cf. the long Yašt to Anahita and the lack of one for A.N.). The largely post-YAv form of western Zoroastrianism in the late Achaemenid period took on a character of its own, with its promotion of Anahita, deemphasis of the Amesha Spentas, use of a new calendar, introduction of statue temples under Artaxerxes II, and finally the fire temples. Albert de Jong has shown that eschatological ideas from the YAv were known by the late Achaemenid era. Theopompus and Eudemus of Rhodes (fourth century BC) attribute ideas of resurrection, world eras of 3,000 years, and proto-Zurvanite notions to the Magi. Plutarch, citing Theopompus as a main source of information, quotes from Yt. 8.44, mentions the Amesha Spentas, relates the future fall of Areimanius, and describes the coming Renovation.  The YAv view of *daeva*s may also appear in Jewish tradition in Tobit (Asmodeus &lt; *Aešma daeva*).  So for these reasons I view OAv and YAv as legitimate sources for the period despite their late date of writing and textual problems.",True,False,False,,0,1564801240,,False,0,{},evuok8o,False,t3_cfhonp,False,True,t1_eugigxz,/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/cfhonp/did_zoroastrianism_influence_christianitys_belief/evuok8o/,False,,1573504259,3,True,[],False,AcademicBiblical,t5_2w28m,r/AcademicBiblical,public,0,

La victoria de la candidata liberaldemócrata en esta circunscripción de Gales –con el apoyo tácito de los nacionalistas y los verdes– deja reducida la mayoría parlamentaria del primer ministro conservador y sus aliados a un solo diputado.

 Tanto los independentistas del Plaid Cymru como los ecologistas galeses justificaron durante la campaña su aval a la liberaldemócrata Jane Dodds en la prioridad de plantar cara a la amenaza de Johnson de propulsar una salida de la UE sin acuerdo. La táctica de ambos partidos de no presentar candidatos propios para favorecer a Dodds les ha permitido derrotar al conservador Chris Davies, quien ocupaba el escaño hasta que se vio forzado a dimitir en junio por un caso de corrupción. Aquel escándalo propició la *by-election* (elección parcial) del jueves, cuyos resultados no se han conocido hasta esta mañana.

 Davies, hallado culpable de uso fraudulento de fondos públicos, volvió a presentarse a los comicios, escudándose en una condena leve que se saldó con una multa y la prestación de 50 horas de servicios comunitarios. Sus rivales han acabado desbancándole en un sufragio local con ecos nacionales.

 A solo una semana del desembarco de Boris Johnson en Downing Street, tras ser aupado por la militancia de su partido para sustituir a Theresa May, el dirigente *tory* ve mermados sus ya precarios apoyos parlamentarios. El nuevo jefe de Gobierno precisa del apoyo de los diputados unionistas norirlandeses (DUP) en la Cámara de los Comunes para sumar una ajustada mayoría absoluta, pero la posición contraria a un Brexit duro de algunos de sus correligionarios desbarata por completo esa aritmética. Ese escenario viene alimentando las especulaciones sobre los supuestos planes de Johnson de convocar elecciones generales anticipadas tras el receso estival de la legislatura que comenzó el 25 de julio, coincidiendo con el relevo al frente del Gobierno.

 La liza en la circunscripción galesa de Brecon &amp; Radnorshire tan solo ha dirimido, sobre el papel, la designación de un diputado al Parlamento de Westminster. Pero su calado nacional reside en el primer éxito de una entente política en contra de la resolución del nuevo Gobierno de desanclar al país de Europa a las bravas. El eje de esa estrategia está en el Partido Liberaldemócrata, el más europeísta del mapa político británico y, a tenor de las encuestas, capaz de arrancar muchos votos al dividido laborismo en unas elecciones generales anticipadas.

 En la elección parcial galesa, los laboristas de Jeremy Corbyn han quedado en un humillante cuarto puesto (12,4%), y por detrás del ultraderechista Partido del Brexit, que se estrenaba en estos comicios. Corbyn ha ido matizando su ambigua posición sobre la Unión Europea hasta el punto de anunciar recientemente que el Partido Laborista votaría sí en un nuevo referéndum sobre la permanencia en Europa. Pero solo si esa fuera la alternativa a un Brexit sin acuerdo o a un pacto negociado con Boris Johnson. En otras palabras, en el supuesto de unas elecciones anticipadas, que muchos consideran inevitables, no está claro que abogara por quedarse en la UE. Y esa es una losa que arrastra el principal partido de la oposición.

 La recién elegida nueva líder liberaldemócrata, Jo Swinson, ya ha sugerido que en el supuesto de adelanto electoral los liberaldemócratas renunciarían a presentarse en algunas circunscripciones para ahondar en la recién estrenada cooperación entre los partidos del frente anti-Brexit. Su colega y candidata vencedora en Brecon &amp; Radnorshire, Jane Dodds, ha enviado al primer ministro el siguiente mensaje: “Mi primer acto como diputada en Westminster será buscar a Boris Johnson, dondequiera que se esconda, y exigirle que deje de jugar con el futuro de nuestro país y descarte un Brexit sin acuerdo”.",True,False,False,,0,1564801921,,False,0,{},evupbr6,True,t3_cldwn7,False,True,t3_cldwn7,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/cldwn7/una_coalición_antibrexit_asesta_el_primer_revés/evupbr6/,False,,1573504674,1,True,[],False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,0,

Ill explain MY reasons and perhaps you can explain why my decision is wrong. Note before you read, I am PRO eu and PRO closer integration. PRO freedom of movement and think all the European immigration has enriched the UK immeasurably. Yet I voted to leave.

The most important thing that needs to be acknowledged, is that the UK population is fundamentally against ever closer union. The general public do not want a closer political union, it is something they passionately detest the thought of. 

All polling done for the last 20 years demonstrates this, for example the last significant poll taken on joining the Euro, a cornerstone of closer integration, was taken in 2012. The result showed only 6% of the country supported it. Six fucking percent. There is almost zero appetite in this country for it, infact the opposite is true. Brits would rather be significantly poorer and weaker than to get more involved in the political project.

So. With this fact established, we need to establish a second fact. That the EU is inevitably and unstoppably on a path towards that ever closer union. 

This means in the future we face two choices, both of which are completely terrible choices. Either the UK population is dragged into that closer union that they ABSOLUTELY DETEST, or the entire project is kept away from said choice by the UK. If you think either of them choices is better than brexit, no matter how shitshowey you think it’s going, no matter how damaging it will be economically to leave, then you sir are a deranged fucking idiot and you might as well not bother replying to me, because you are not worth the time it takes for me to type out my scorn of you.

Now let’s get down to the damage of brexit. Every economist on the planet now agrees that economically, the impacts of brexit long term are just a POTENTIAL LOSS OF THEORETICAL GROWTH, but that we will still be a growing economy. We just won’t grow quite as much. Once we leave, probably with a no deal, we will then have as long as we want or need to formalise an actual relationship with the EU, whether it takes 2 years or 20, it WILL be done. 

I hope I explained my reasons adequately enough. I’ve explained them on reddit a hundred times since the vote and nobody has EVER replied with a solution to that fundamental problem of the unstoppable force of “ever closer union” meeting the immovable object of “British opposition to it”.",True,False,False,,1,1564808521,,False,0,{},evuw698,False,t3_cl5icy,False,True,t1_evuolwn,/r/ukpolitics/comments/cl5icy/if_labour_was_in_power_the_press_would_be_calling/evuw698/,False,,1573508032,3,True,[],False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

 Para especialistas ouvidos pela **Folha**, ainda que a decisão pontual de quinta-feira (1º) seja tecnicamente pouco contestável, a origem da investigação compromete a validade da medida.

 O professor de direito constitucional da FGV-SP Roberto Dias afirma que há uma série de problemas em relação ao inquérito em si, e não a respeito do despacho.

  

  

 “É um inquérito que não tem um fato determinado, com vários problemas jurídicos. [O assunto] não tem relação direta com o próprio objeto do inquérito, que já é bastante amplo de apuração.”

 Diferentemente do que costuma acontecer no Judiciário, o Supremo abriu o inquérito sem a provocação do Ministério Público, por iniciativa da própria Justiça.

 [O inquérito das fake ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/investigacao-de-fake-news-contra-supremo-identifica-suspeitos-e-prepara-buscas.shtml)[news](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/investigacao-de-fake-news-contra-supremo-identifica-suspeitos-e-prepara-buscas.shtml) foi instaurado por determinação do próprio presidente do STF, Dias Toffoli, em março, para apurar notícias falsas e ameaças na internet contra membros da corte. Moraes foi designado por Toffoli como juiz relator.

 A iniciativa tem despertado, desde aquela época, reclamações do Ministério Público Federal, visto como um possível alvo das investigações por causa de críticas de procuradores feitas a decisões da corte.  
 O advogado e professor aposentado da Faculdade de Direito da USP Modesto Carvalhosa entende que houve ilegalidade no despacho de Moraes de quinta-feira.

 “É absolutamente ilegal, porque advém de um inquérito manifestamente ilegal. O inquérito em si é um absurdo porque transforma o Supremo em investigador do próprio crime que ele vai julgar. Isso não tem fundamento jurídico, conforme a Procuradoria-Geral da República já claramente mostrou.”

 A deputada estadual de São Paulo [Janaína Paschoal (PSL),](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/janaina-pede-impeachment-de-toffoli-por-decisao-que-beneficiou-flavio-bolsonaro.shtml) que é professora de direito, também criticou a medida de Moraes. Disse em rede social que, “sem saber qual o objeto, quais as partes e quais os advogados, o tal inquérito pode servir para qualquer coisa”.

 Membros do Ministério Público Federal também reagiram. Nesta sexta (2), a Associação Nacional dos Procuradores da República voltou a defender o arquivamento do inquérito em tramitação no Supremo.

 Disse que a decisão de Moraes é “mais um capítulo do ilegal” procedimento e que seu encerramento é “imperioso”. “Desde a sua gênese, a investigação citada afronta o Estado Democrático de Direito ao usurpar atribuição do Ministério Público.”

 Também na quinta-feira, o ministro Luiz Fux determinou que as provas obtidas na operação contra os hackers, batizada de Spoofing, não sejam destruídas e fiquem copiadas no Supremo. A ordem contraria o que havia sido dito inicialmente pelo ministro da Justiça, Sergio Moro, de que o material obtido seria inutilizado.

 As medidas dos ministros do STF se deram no mesmo dia em que [mensagens publicadas pela **Folha**,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/deltan-incentivou-cerco-da-lava-jato-a-toffoli-revelam-mensagens.shtml) em parceria com o site The Intercept Brasil, revelaram que, em 2016, Deltan incentivou colegas a investigar Dias Toffoli.

 Para o deputado federal [Luiz Flávio Gomes (PSB-SP),](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/07/34-deputados-contrariam-partidos-ao-votar-previdencia-veja-lista.shtml) que é doutor em direito, a decisão de Fux foi correta, mas o magistrado deveria se afastar do caso por ter o nome citado nas trocas de mensagens reveladas pelo Intercept. 

 Reportagem do Intercept publicada em junho aponta que Moro e o procurador Deltan Dallagnol conversaram em 2016 a respeito do apoio de Fux à Lava Jato. O então juiz da operação chegou a dizer no diálogo, segundo o site, [“in Fux we trust”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/in-fux-we-trust-diz-moro-a-deltan-em-mensagem-sobre-ministro-do-stf.shtml) (“em Fux nós confiamos”).

 “Uma das falas do Deltan é de que o Fux estava com ele. Eu diria que já tem elementos para dizer que está envolvido e que, por consequência, não poderia atuar”, diz Gomes.

 Para o professor de direito Antonio Santoro, da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Fux não deveria determinar o envio de cópia do material apreendido em uma resposta a um pedido para que o material não fosse destruído. O requerimento para garantir a preservação das conversas havia sido protocolado no Supremo pelo PDT.

  

 “Para ele trazer a investigação, não caberia naquele âmbito. Teria ser que ser no âmbito de uma investigação específica”, diz o professor.

 [Para Modesto Carvalhosa,](https://saidapeladireita.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2019/04/18/ombudsman-do-stf-jurista-diz-que-toffoli-e-moraes-cometem-terrorismo/) o envio dos dados ao Supremo “é extremamente estranho” por se tratar de material derivado de um crime.

 “É aberrante porque transforma o corpo de delito [conjunto de vestígios de um crime] numa peça acusatória contra a própria vítima.”

 Já o advogado e professor de direito da PUC-SP Pedro Estevam Serrano avalia que a decisão de Fux está de acordo com as regras processuais do país.

 “Existe um princípio chamado poder geral de cautela do juiz. Cautela quer dizer proteção. Se ele [Fux] manda não destruir, mas no final do processo alguém destruir, a decisão final vai ter pouca eficácia prática. Então, ele foi mais cauteloso, mais protetor, mandou não destruir e pediu cópia. Isso está dentro desse poder de cautela do juiz.”

 Para o advogado e professor emérito da Universidade Mackenzie Ives Gandra Martins, não houve ilegalidades nas medidas adotadas por Moraes e Fux. “São medidas perfeitamente possíveis porque autoridades dos três Poderes tiveram seu sigilo quebrado de forma ilegal”, afirmou Martins.

 O advogado e professor de direito da USP Miguel Reale Júnior também considera lícitos os despachos dos dois ministros. 

 “É a confirmação de que qualquer medida que se tome em relação a essas provas, sejam lícitas ou ilícitas, depende do Judiciário. É a demonstração de que o conteúdo, malgrado seja uma prova ilícita, pode vir a servir à defesa de algum réu, algum condenado. É muito importante a preservação da prova”, disse.

 Para Roberto Dias, as medidas [dos ministros do STF](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/stf/) sobre o material apreendido podem fazer com que a corte tenha que se manifestar sobre a validade do uso das conversas como prova. 

 Esse eventual desdobramento favorece as defesas de condenados da Lava Jato, que ambicionam anular decisões tomadas no âmbito da Lava Jato com o argumento de que Moro, juiz responsável pela operação, agiu de modo irregular.

Williams boots and it seemed people liked it. I've since replaced three of the four pairs in that post because I liked the Havana suede Comfort model so much I figured I'd just have my entire collection be current Comfort models. A big spend, but whereas the original/Classic Craftsman with the leather lining just feels like a typical boot, the Comfort Craftsman is genuinely up there with sneakers in terms of comfort, it's crazy how good it is.

The current collection are all 2019 Comfort Craftsmans in Black Suede (Made to Order), Black Yearling, Rum Yearling and Havana Suede. Havana wasn't available when I bought mine at the warehouse sale but they've since released it in their Spring/Summer 2020 collection. The belts are Black and Chestnut Dress, Black and Chestnut Jerrawa, and Caramel and Havana Drover. Unfortunately they don't make Rum belts so Chestnut is the closest match, and they don't make a black suede belt or I'd have that in Drover. Caramel was a free gift for some errors RM made shipping me the wrong things MTO.

I've read some comments from cobblers on here that RM's quality has gone down in recent years. I can't speak to the parts I can't see but from a consumer's perspective at least, the reverse seems to be true. Their product lineup is the best it's ever been and I'm really happy with the fit and finish of all of these boots. The microfibre/poron comfort inner is ridiculously good, all the boots are fully kid lined and stitched well, the welt joins are much finer than they used to be, and the hides seem pretty good to me although I'm no leather expert. Black and Rum are both yearling which they've been offering forever, but I know the Chinchillas are European crust leather, and the SS20 Havana is a new Italian suede which is noticeably softer and more nappy than their previous suedes. I drew ""/R/"" in it with my finger to try to show this. The black suede appears to be the same as my old 2011 Craftsmans had, however.

I think these four are a broad enough that I've got no plans to buy any more RM's unless they bring something interesting out in the future like a burgundy leather or suede would be pretty cool (Rum aniline is more of a typical brown than the pic suggests), or offer the Chinchilla/Signature models with comfort inners.

Oh no no. The New York Times isn't even *almost* a reputable new source. Just from my own personal collection of bullshit NYT has pulled: Sarah Jeong [(an absolutely rabid anti-white racist)](https://imgur.com/gallery/TvpJhjh) being hired to it's editorial board; the New York Times science section intentionally spreading fake news by claiming the Trump administration was trying to erase transgenderism because they intentionally confused sex, gender, and gender-identity to their readers; evidence that a NYT reporter was sleeping with a source emerged while she was being investigated for potentially leaking classified documents, just recently they basically doxxed a village of Hondurans that have been in a full-fledged gang war with MS-13 (which means all of those people's lives are in extreme danger), and the NYT stealth edited an article which accused the Trump administration of making the EPA change how it counts deaths from air pollution (this was not the first or last time these stealth edits have happened).

That's just some of the egregious stuff that *only* the NYT was involved in alone. I'm sure there's more if I start looking at group activities and media blitzes like Kavanaugh or Covington.

These places are *not* reliable. Activist Journalism is the name of the fucking game nowadays. Journalists feel it is their *responsibility* to be activists *first*. Objectivity is an *abhorrent* concept to them nowadays. It's treated with open contempt. Vox was fucking praising Gatekeeping during their spat with Crowder.

You are *hard fucking pressed* to find good journalism nowadays.

&gt;Articles are written and edited by hundreds or thousands of people, leveraging a collective knowledge base. You seem to think that page was written by one author with an agenda LOL.

Wikipedia's been lying about GamerGate for the past 8 years. Not a fucking *word* on that page is true, and that is because specific editors have specific authority and control over the page. It's not as open source as you think, that's why /r/WikiInAction exists. Many activists make it their *fucking mission in life* to make Wikipedia pages the way they want it. It's been a full on culture war battleground for *years*. Conservapedia, as bad as it is, exists because of how slanted Wikipedia became.

Now, a bit of an order change to keep the theme:

&gt;I’d like to give you the benefit of the doubt that you’re not a complete neo-Nazi POS or mentally deranged. Are you just attracted to bloviating authoritarians?

I'm a Libertarian, so no. Also, I'm not a neo-Nazi. Miscegenation now, Miscegenation tomorrow, and Miscegenation forever!

&gt;He represents everything I could loathe in a person: greed, egotism, carelessness, crassness, lying, boastfulness. Just makes me sick to see our hear him.

I personally don't like how Trump conducts himself, but I can't argue with his results, which have been *far* more positive than I predicted. Despite massive pressure from the establishment, he's kept us out of War in Iran, Ukraine, and kept war in Syria to a minimum. He's openly challenged both Soros and Koch's DAVOS agenda for an Imperial seizure of Africa as a form of competition with the Chinese and EU. His tax program was not an overhaul like I would have preferred, but he genuinely reduced taxes on the majority of people. He has effectively made headway in Korea, and most importantly, he's done a stellar job with the economy. He is responsible for the sudden rise in American wages, something most presidents never achieved. 

I'm not gonna lie. As former military and a Physics major, I'm psyched about Space Force.

I'm genuinely impressed by his successes because they are *very* important successes. The one that shocked me the most is Betsy DeVos, who I wouldn't even give the time of day to in 2016. But, she's done very positive things against the Title IX tribunal systems in colleges and has rescinded the ""Dear Colleague Memo"". The Trump administration is looking into pressuring colleges to stop the Tribunals and the *insane* 5th amendment violations that have been going along with them.

Is Trump a shitposter? Absolutely. Is that what you want in a leader? No. Does he know what he's doing to the media when he shitposts? Unequivocally.

Was Trump a fucking dick on the campaign? 100% To this day, hearing him talk annoys me.

Is there more to him than that? Absolutely, genuinely, has an impressive kind side to him. Only his fans end up seeing it because he's always fighting, but at his rallies you can sometimes see his kind side when he's talking to his fans, and it really is a whole different side to him.

&gt;It’s disturbing that so many people see anything positive at all about him. I hate to say it but I’m beginning to understand how Hitler rose to power.

No, you don't. You clearly don't *know* how Hitler rose to power. 

Hitler was a former Leftist who, like many disheartened leftists, found Fascism to be a similar but ultimately superior political structure. Hitler's rise to power involved literally killing his way to the top, even his close allies and developing a personality cult around him. Hitler drafted himself and the fascists as the last hope of defending *multiple* attempted coups by Communists and even invasions by the Red Army. Hitler and the Fascists pointed out that Democracy was too weak to defend itself form Communism, and Liberalism was to amoral. The state was the absolute moral representation of the will of the people (or nation). This is why Hitler's famous propaganda piece is called ""Triumph of The Will"". Hitler has very specific views about how Germany was to be oriented, and how the people had to sacrifice to the will of Germany, which was the State. The State was deified, to the point of being immortal. This is where the Thousand Year Reich came from. You sacrificed yourself to the greater cause. Meanwhile, Hitler became Germany, and Germany became Hitler, and Hitler preached strength by the eradication of things outside of the will, and he was the man to guarantee that the German people could be made perfect.

Trump is nothing like this. Trump's rise to power was bloodless and mostly entertaining rather than dangerous and violent. Trump does not have a cult following (as anyone on the strong right wing can attest to), Trump is not equating himself with the state, and he is not saying that the state is the embodiment of the people's will. 

Trump is a 90's Democrat responding to people who have felt utterly abandoned for decades. Trump is not a military expansionist, and has intentionally kept out of wars he *could* have started. To be honest, thank fucking God the right wing has attached themselves to Donald Trump. Trump's message is unifying under civic nationalism, which most fascists rejected. 

Frankly, you should be thanking your lucky stars that Donlad Trump won is what the right wing are attaching themselves to. If Hillary Clinton won, and the social justice racket expanded, and the US jumped on additional wasteful military adventures, and the economy declined from further poorly planned centralization, and wages continued to stagnate, and the Media and Silicon Valley continued to censor, it is *far* more likely you would see the right wing latch on to a much more genuine fascist figure. Someone more akin to Huey Long or Father Coughlin.

Hate doesn't give rise to Fascists. Communist aggression gives rise to Fascists as a form of ""self-defense"".

&gt;And quite frankly even after purchasing the S400s we still made several offers to buy patriots as well.

No... Can you cite sources supporting that statement? It's again the other way around:

It was again the Turks that refused.

The rest of your comment is of similar quality, heavily leaning on memes that are contrary to reality. For example:

&gt;they refuse to extradite fetullah gulen for years now, even though we have provided clear proof of his involvement in terrorist activities and other illegal activities against the Turkish state

Mind posting this ""evidence""? We have evidence that Gulen is a political opponent to Erdogan nothing more afaik. You're seem to blindly believe any claim that's made by Erdogan without the need of actual evidence, relying on feelings rather than facts.

&gt;but when American M4 carbines with serial numbers that match weapons shipped to the PYD

Can you source that? Not saying it's impossible but I don't quite remember the US arming the SDF with m-4's to begin with. And I am curious in regard to quantities involved since you know, the black market exists and transcends national loyalties.

&gt;yet you picked the Kurds over a NATO ally who was prepared to go into Syria to fight IS with US support

When was Turkey willing to go into Syria to fight ISIS? Sure as hell not in 2014. The SDF was the **last** party the US wanted to ally with, specifically because of Turkish concerns. For a few years they have tried to form an Arab force that would combat ISIS, spending hundreds of millions in the process and spectacularly failing:

&gt;The Obama administration on Friday abandoned its efforts to build up a new rebel force inside Syria to combat the Islamic State, acknowledging the failure of its $500 million campaign to train thousands of fighters and announcing that it will instead use the money to provide ammunition and some weapons for groups already engaged in the battle.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/world/middleeast/pentagon-program-islamic-state-syria.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/world/middleeast/pentagon-program-islamic-state-syria.html)

Only **after** Turkish (and Jordanian) supported Arab force spectacularly failed both in the south and the North, did the US ramped up aid to the YPG as the only anti ISIS option left standing.

&gt;US-trained Division 30 rebels 'betray US and hand weapons over to al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria'  
&gt;  
&gt;Division 30 was the first faction whose fighters graduated from a **US-led training programme in Turkey** which aims to forge a force on the ground in Syria to fight against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil).

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11882195/US-trained-Division-30-rebels-betrayed-US-and-hand-weapons-over-to-al-Qaedas-affiliate-in-Syria.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11882195/US-trained-Division-30-rebels-betrayed-US-and-hand-weapons-over-to-al-Qaedas-affiliate-in-Syria.html)

Still, the US went to extraordinary lengths to address Turkish concerns, every run down Jihadit supported by the CIA was armed **far** better than anything the SDF **ever** got. Thousands of ATGMs went to Turkish supported rebels in Idlib. Almost none to the SDF, no sniper rifles, large caliber mortars, very few machine guns and so on.

I can go on, but really lets first iron down what happened with the Patriot systems, where as I have shown the US was willing time and again to sell those to Turkey, while it was Turkey that refused. By all means I believe Turkey has every right to buy the S400 instead and **should not be sanctioned for it**. However US concerns in regard to the system compromising F-35 which is a US flagship project for the air force, as well as the air force of the navy and marines and a cornerstone in US defense for most of the next century should not be as easily brushed away as done by you.

It's kind of the same setup as the punching Nazis issue. Is it okay? Not really, no. Is it the forwards path of minimal conflict? I hope not?

This is part of the problem - because Brexit \*was &amp; is\* the will of the people, and one thing that could really have helped the UK was a leader who had the stones to say ""look, it's only just a majority, and it's a huge decision which *even if everything goes perfectly* is going to be massively expensive in money / time / effort, *and* it has failure modes that include national food &amp; medicine shortages, recession, GFA violations, and the breakup of the Kingdom.

The rest were split between ""May's Deal"" (might have been the lowest?) and ""Soft Brexit"" (which is garbage non-option, the EU has been pretty clear about WA and renegotiation).

Title: **How does international divorce work?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I have a few questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1- Is an e-mail a valid official notification to be served for divorce in 2019? I don't think it is as someone's e-mail could be hacked, e-mail addresses could be old and not used anymore, people could not even check it or read it etc etc
&gt; 
&gt; 2- I know if one person wants a divorce, they don't need signature or consent from the other party to divorce, of course. But how does that work for alimony? Can that be enforced internationally? Same things for legal expenses and fees. If one files for divorce in the US and the other party is not a US citizen but an European one living in Europe, can legal fees be enforced as well? If so, how? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

IF YOU STARTED reading this article as Loganair Flight 711 lifted off from the compacted-gravel runway at Papa Westray (airport code PPW), a tiny island at the northern end of Orkney, it would have landed by the time you finished. Its first destination, the neighbouring island of Westray (WRY), is all of 2.7km away—a distance shorter than Heathrow airport’s runways. Lasting less than two minutes, the route holds the record for the shortest scheduled flight in the world.

Some 75-odd weekly inter-island services connect Kirkwall, the main settlement and primary airport in Orkney, with six islands on the archipelago. Last year, around 21,000 passengers flew between the islands on Loganair’s three Britten-Norman Islander aircraft, which can carry up to eight passengers in a minivan-style arrangement. North Ronaldsay (population 72) and Papa Westray (population 90) received the most traffic. Neither island has a pier, and ferry crossings are infrequent or, depending on weather, non-existent. “So we try to compensate” with the air service, says James Stockan, the council leader.


The Papa Westray-Westray trip is cheap for passengers—£17 one way, and £1 more to fly all the way back to Kirkwall—but costlier for taxpayers. The Orkney Islands Council throws in another £46 (€50), adding up to an annual subsidy bill of just under £1m. The subsidy—paid for largely by the Scottish government—is exempt from strict European Union rules on state aid because it is a “lifeline” route. This is no exaggeration: between October and April, all North Ronaldsay’s supplies, including food, come by air every Tuesday.

The route is in contention for another record: the first commercial electric flight. In the world of commercial aviation, electric aircraft are likely to be taking off shortly. An Israeli model, expected to be operating by 2022, was unveiled at the Paris Air Show this year. Cranfield University, which specialises in aeronautics, is working on something simpler for the Islander—retrofitting it with electric power.

Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s boss, says he is sceptical of attempts to put electric engines on big planes, but “with the Islander we are confident and comfortable that it does work, that this is a technically feasible solution.” Moreover, Orkney’s inter-island flights are short enough for range anxiety to not be a big concern. The longest trip, from Kirkwall to North Ronaldsay, is no more than 20 minutes. Indeed, electric planes could make small, short routes such as these more economically viable, and therefore more common.

Orkney is already a leader in green energy. It generates more wind power than it consumes—it sells electricity to the national grid—has the highest rate of electric-vehicle ownership in Scotland and is experimenting with batteries to store excess energy. The council is working on a scheme to introduce hydrogen-powered ferries in 2021. If all goes according to plan, Loganair’s e-planes should take off the following year. ■",True,False,False,,0,1564821378,,False,0,{},evv632e,True,t3_clgkhl,False,False,t3_clgkhl,/r/ukpolitics/comments/clgkhl/the_worlds_shortest_flight_may_soon_be_its/evv632e/,False,,1573513991,24,True,[],False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

&gt;I just generally object to the casual way you cast baseless assertions and the broad brush you paint with. 

And then give no basis for your assertion that those examples were justified.

Let me show you what a baseless assertion looks like. A sentence like this, perhaps:

&gt; It was clear from your first post above that you cannot tell your friends from your enemies in this world, that you are quick to condemn without proper understanding...

about a post that never even talked about friends or enemies, much less my own. You make this assertion, and then give no basis. Whereas when I made the assertion, I followed it up with examples as basis.

&gt;You paint a picture of America preying on the free and democratic  peoples of the world rather than defending them at great cost, as it has  done 

In old times, European powers used to secure market access by conquering territories and converting colonies. After the WWII, America could have continued the practice, but they had, because of the fact that European powers were largely finished and couldn't compete with America, a better way. They assured everyone that America would ensure the security of the world's oceans, as long as the world opened its markets to America. It was not done out of a ""love for democracy, freedom and development. To lift everyone with the tide"", which is easily illustrated from the United Fruit incident, Panama invasion and the overthrow of the Iranian democracy. When America was denied market access where it wanted it, democracy was second priority, and human rights were farther behind still. This statement:

&gt; America preying on the free and democratic peoples of the world rather than defending them at great cost, as it has done. 

is a broad statement you are making without fully understanding the picture. America became the world's police not out of some moral compulsion, but because it was profitable. So whenever it wasn't profitable, it transforms into world mafia.

But if you want to count a victory, I did make a mistake with the beer statistics. You were right, it was four companies. However, I still make the assertion that you are an America lover who will always look at the world through biased eyes, and will bend logic over backward to keep thinking you were right.

If flying into Germany from USA, your dogs will need to be chipped with RFID chips that are compatible with the German/EU system. The dogs will need to be up to date on typical vaccines common in the USA. The rabies vaccine requirements may require a booster and some additional paperwork. And lots of paper documentation of all of the other vaccines, vet check up, etc. Lastly, you will need a USDA vet to sign off on some docs within 10 days of your travel - this can get tight logistically, but can be done via FedEx’ing the form and payment overnight to the USDA vet office near you (they do not do a checkup on the dogs). https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/pets.html#dogs

Note: There are some breed restrictions/prohibitions in Germany. https://www.zoll.de/EN/Private-individuals/Travel/Entering-Germany/Restrictions/Dangerous-dogs/dangerous-dogs.html

Once you arrive, you will need to visit a German vet. They can get you an EU Pet Passport. This doc is needed to make per travel within the EU pretty easy/painless. https://thepointsguy.com/guide/european-union-pet-passport/

You will need to pay a dog tax in the city where you live. You also should get liability insurance (may be required). You also may opt to get pet medical insurance... We have found our German vet to be much less expensive than our USA vet, but pet meds and lab work are dramatically more expensive... the result being higher total cost. I would recommend getting pet medical insurance.

Lastly, depending on what German state you live in, and the size and weight of your dog, you may need to take an exam to show you are knowledgeable about dog behavior, breeds, breeding, laws, etc. Many people refer to this as the 20/40 rule, or that your dog is a 20/40 dog. If your dog is 20 kg (or more), **or** is 40 cm (or more) in height at the withers, it’s a 20/40 dog. If this applies to your dog and you live in NRW (for example), you must take a 109 question long, multiple choice exam, in German. The exam is available on line to use as a study guide, but you have to sit down and take it in person with pen and paper at the local vet authority office. The fee was either 30 or 60€; I can’t remember.

Do your research… There’s a lot of good stuff out there on the inter-webs. The above tips are based on our own experience with in the last year. Your mileage may vary.

One last thought… If your dogs are larger than 8 kg, it’s a good idea to get them used to wearing a muzzle. Germany is very dog friendly compared to the US, but you will run into certain modes of transportation – such as the high-speed ICE trains - where you can bring your dog with you when you travel, but the dog technically will be required to wear a muzzle unless it is in a crate.

&gt; ""We have to conquer our own country and purify it of all infidels. Then, we should conquer the infidels' countries and spread Islam. The infidels who are usurping our countries have announced war against Islam and Muslims, forcing Muslims to abandon Islam and change their beliefs."" – Abdullah Mansour, current leader of the Uyghur separatist movement Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from ""The Duty of Faith and Support,"" Voice of Islam/al-Fajr Media Center, August 26, 2009.

Can you blame China for wanting to nip this extremism in the bud? Better than just letting these salafi mosques spread around like Europe has done. Now there are tens of thousands of Europeans who are willing to join groups like ISIS and blow themselves up all across the continent.

Africa has benefited greatly from Chinese investments. They offer infrastructure building loans and on rare occasions when they arent repaid, China takes a cut of the businesses as collateral. Pretty standard. With the US and the IMF, the businesses are up for grabs as a pre-requisite for receiving a loan, and their economies are liberalised super fast to the point where massive economic damage is caused, and the country falls into a debt trap, but western corporations make a killing. Whereas, countries that get ""screwed over"" by China are those that are too stupid to realise they cant afford the loan in the first place. They dont have to take it. They choose to, and then they fail to live up to the terms of the agreement.

Its not predatory because the people in charge of the country are educated and should know better.

The whole traditions of common law in the Anglo-American countries and and the European continental traditions are very different. This has nothing to do about ""allowing their politics to inform their faith and philosophy"", as there are quite a few different law codes and less different streams of moral theology and ethics, at least in Europe.

One of the main shifts in law and moral theology in Europe was the experience of the lawlessness and inhumanity in the decades of WWII and the Third Reich, an experience which influenced both law theory and moral theology and ethics alike. The habit of honoring life and human dignity regardless of ones (criminal) actions or intents gained influence almost simultaneously and independently in civic law theory and moral theology and ethics. And it's a general attitude or habit of our societies in Europe, as well.

I would agree, but it's how you implement STV that's the problem.

I'm not convinced it has 'revived' you. If anything, it's more like brigading! You're being taken over by Labour 'moderates' and 'soft tories' who aren't actually liberal at all. That said, stopping Brexit is a worthy cause to be brigaded over.

The Lib Dems can't deliver STV on their own - they'd need Labour support. McDonnell actually does genuinely seem pro-reform, and is enough of an operator to see it through if the opportunity arose. I think the best we can hope for is a Lab-Lib alliance promising a second ref and ultimately Labour backing remain in that. 

The Lib Dem's price for that support could be the implementation of STV, which I think the Labour Party would be willing to pay, because it could be sold as a solution to having to remain. I.e. 'look, Brexit has clearly shown up divisions in British society, but these divisions aren't so much an issue with Europe as they are an issue at home - our politics isn't working. Therefore, we back remain, but we also back STV to bring democracy closer to the people'.

Can you give examples? I'm not denying those things happened I just want to know what you're referring to so I'm able to respond.

&gt; I think it proved that you can't force people into communism. 

The ""Ruled by terror"" narrative is ahistorical and is a result of hard-to-justify second-hand sources. Works like ""Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia[^(\[1\])](http://ge.tt/2W0V2Id1/v/0?c)"" by Robert Thurston and ""The Road to Terror[^(\[2\])](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XYy2KcKfTQIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)"" by J. Getty, both anti-Stalinist writers, explain how Stalin would be unable to rule via terror and how the terror was a result of decentralized local administrators who acted in their own interest and at many times went directly against the will of the Buro. This wasn't ""\[forcing\] people into communism\]"".

And the belief that ""Anyone who spoke out against the party, or Stalin, was purged"" is also false. In the book ""Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar"" it says:[^(\[3\])](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/4.php)[^(\[4\])](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/5.php)

&gt;\[Molotov\] often disagreed with, and criticized, Stalin right up until the end (...)  Voroshilov, Mikoyan and Molotov frequently disagreed with Stalin. 

All of the figures listed above were in high positions in the Party and felt free to criticize Stalin without fear of losing their position or death. Even an old Soviet politician, Zhukov, has stated[^(\[5\])](https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-nmIGAXUrq0OJ87zK/Khrushchev%20Lied_djvu.txt):

&gt; By the way, (...) Stalin was not at all the kind of man before whom one could not post sharp questions and with whom one could not argue, and even firmly defend one's own point of view. 

And citizens were often encouraged to criticize directors and lower/middle levels of government. As it says in the first link I've mentioned, and in ""The Red Executive[^(\[6\])](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Executive-Organization-Russian-Industry/dp/B0000CKNEH?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-d-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B0000CKNEH)"" which has the following quote:

&gt;One factory director (...) implied that production meetings were a real ordeal for him. But at a question as to whether workers dared to criticize openly, he said, ""any director who suppressed criticism would be severely punished. he would not only be removed, he would be tried.""

And in the work ""The CPSU in a Soviet Election Campaign[^(\[7\])](https://www.docdroid.net/25FEQ8G/the-cpsu-in-a-soviet-election-campaign.pdf)"" it says:

&gt;(...) meetings of workers' collectives, where those present are encouraged to speak frankly about the personal qualities of the proposed candidates.

None of these works were written by Stalinists or even communist. The narrative of ""A totalitarian dictatorship forcing hegemony through terror!"" is just objectively ahistorical. Stalin said it best himself[^(\[8\])](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/dec/13.htm):

No, I didn't, because it was already popularized on the internet.  I saw it, chuckled, and moved on because it doesn't impact me at all.  I'm glad your friends showed you the goats, because they are quite funny.

And I just told you that written material gets lost very, very easily.  I even gave you an example of an incredible resource for finding the only known records of hundreds of lost books and papers.  Their authors wrote them.  And guess what?  We don't have them anymore.  I agree, humans write stuff down.  They also do a pretty bad job of preserving that stuff for hundreds of years.

I still don't understand why you're so hung up on 1880.  Why does it matter so much to you that, for all we know, they emerged only 140 years ago?  From reading your other replies, you seem to think that this is because evolution takes thousands of years.  And that is true.  Evolution *does* take a long time because it is a very random process in which *natural selection* causes beneficial traits to be passed on more often than detrimental traits.

But we are talking about *artificial selection*.  Just for sake of argument, let's say that fainting goats only appeared in 1880.  From all the sources that you can find, they were first brought by some dude to Tennessee, yes?  That means they are domestic goats, raised and selectively bred by this guy.  It's clear that he didn't just have a pen of goats and wolves and let the wolves decide which goats bred.  He *chose* to breed fainting goats, so this is *artificial selection* and NOT natural selection.

Now, about India and Ireland.  If it is true that the fainting goats only appeared in 1880, that doesn't preclude them from appearing across the globe nowadays.  Why?  Because people bring them across the ocean.  You ever wonder how dog breeds spread from one continent to the other?  Do you think that labradors 'evolved' from wolves in Europe and the Americas totally separate from each other?

You can even look up for yourself that domesticated goats originate from ""Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe"".  So how in the world did they (again, domesticated goats) get to North America? Humans.  How did they get to Ireland and India? Humans.

And so because humans are so intertwined into the history of goats and goatkind, it's ridiculous to think that fainting goats suddenly became commonplace because of *evolution*.  Like I said before, the fainting trait may have emerged randomly through mutation, but *humans* saw that and said, ""Wow, I like this for some reason.  I'm going to breed the hell out of this and get more fainting goats!"".  Therefore, the fainting goat does *not* disprove evolution because it arose so quickly because of human intervention and *artificial selection*.",True,False,False,,0,1564832660,,1564832935,0,{},evvdmq1,False,t3_clf0eg,False,True,t1_evvcrzz,/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/clf0eg/hey_yo_do_fainting_goats_disprove_evolution/evvdmq1/,False,,1573517565,2,True,[],False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,r/NoStupidQuestions,public,0,

Here's the story kid.

So there are plenty of people that want to explore the dark web, they want to see what's in there what's dark web like and they ask themselves how does dark weeb look like?Is it scary and creepy like those mystery boxes that some people have ordered? But if you actually think that the dark web is some kind of a place that you can make jokes with your friends that means that you are literally in the wrong place.There have been different people that have went through the dark web without any protection and they got threatened by different pedophiles and hackers they even said to do horrible sexual things for them.There have been different people that have experienced these kind of situations and just as you know there are plenty of hackers and criminels and  even child pedophiles that want to do creepy stuff on people especially on those who go through there without any protection but if you want to explore the dark web you should always use a good VPN to hide your IP location and you can find everything there including weapons, drugs, children, human smuggling sites, hitman agencies and i also forgot to mention one thing that  even the FBI and CIA have never managed to catch these dirty criminels. But one day i was watching all these videos saying that the dark web is so creepy that you do not wanna go there and i was so curious to visit it so i decided to explore it. So i went to this site called ""Candle"" which is in the deep web and i started searching for ilegal stuff like drugs, guns, hitman agencies and I was actually curious to know if there was any human smuggling sites but of course i wasn't gonna buy any of that because i would end up in jail for the rest of my life.These human smuggling sites are so disgusting and creepy that none of you should even think about visiting it. So i already managed to get to the deep web searching engine called ""candle"" and from there i did not know what to search so the first thing that i searched was a hitman agency i did not manage to remember the agency's name though  but forget it so there was a message on the profile that said ""We do work in Europe, Asia and in America but i first thought that this was probably a scam because the half of the sites can scam you sometimes but this one was not even a scam thing and this was probably a real site and the people on this site the creators who created it were not messing around they were really serious so if you want to hire someone to kill someone that you want you have to pay them like 150.000$ dollars.And then i decided to explore a site like silk road so it was a site where you could find like plenty of guns drugs, including weed cocaine and LSD drugs and it was unbelieveable. And then there comes the creepy part so i was searching through the dark web and i was of course using a good VPN for privacy purposes and then i found this site but i am not going to tell the site's name because it's creepy as hell so they were selling these young kids from the age of 4-13 and they were even selling adults.The page was so creepy that i was totally shocked at what i saw.I saw these young kids that were traded and as far as i remember trading young minors is against the law.I even have images of the the searching engine called ""Candle"" but like i said earlier i am not going to say the site's name because it's like way too creepy .So i just want to give a few advices to those who try to explore the dark web for the first time in their lives and remember use a good VPN a good protection program that can hide your IP location and dark web is very dangerous for those who try to explore it without a VPN program.",True,False,False,,0,1564832960,,1564865739,0,{},evvdv7w,False,t3_ckfo1e,False,True,t1_evqjcel,/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ckfo1e/those_who_try_to_explore_the_dark_web_without_any/evvdv7w/,False,,1573517673,1,True,[],False,Thetruthishere,t5_2sntx,r/Thetruthishere,public,0,
