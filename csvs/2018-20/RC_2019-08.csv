If you don't have these constraints, you just wait around for good deals to pop up before booking.

Similarly, travel is pretty damn cheap if you don't mind taking a 5am flight to a random rural airport, taking a 3 hour bus to another airport, waiting 12 hours in the airport, then taking a 1am flight to another rural airport, then taking another bus to your final destination.

It's somewhat a political issue as well.

In the prototype Twingo, three battery packs are fitted in front and two in what used to be the gas tank. The whole pack, bought from a Tesla Inc. parts reseller, weighs 120 kilograms (265 pounds). To compare, Renault's electric Zoe has a 290 kilogram battery for a 210 kilometer driving range. Prices start at around 23,000 euros excluding battery rental battery. The transition takes less than a day, leaving the original stick shift and gear box and installing the plug behind the hatch that drivers usually pop open to refill the tank. Founder Aymeric Libeau, whose previous experiences include co-founding software company Pentalog Group, has worked on retrofitting for two years, and tested the method with a French business school. He is looking to raise 6 million euros to build a factory he says would be capable of churning out as many as 4,000 vehicles next year.

The best way for us to help you is if you told us what your goals are for your language, orthography, romanization, etc. Here are some things to consider:

* Are you going for a certain aesthetic? For example, do you want your language to be reminiscent of French? Japanese? Sumerian?

* Related to aesthetic, do you have a preference for digraphs? Diacritics? Uncommon symbols like yogh ⟨ȝ⟩?

* Do you want your orthography/romanization to be intuitive for English speakers to read? Do you want it to be systematic (e.g., one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes)? Or do you want your orthography to have historical spellings and irregularities (e.g., English [naɪt] being spelled *knight*, alluding to when it used to be pronounced something like [kniːçt] a thousand years ago).

With all that in mind, here is what I came up with for your language. I got rid of your trigraphs, and went with something a little more intuitive for monolingual English speakers to read. Like u/storkstalkstock already said, your proto and daughter languages don't have to have the same orthography/romanization, so I went ahead and used ⟨b d g⟩ for the unaspirated plosive series and ⟨p t k⟩ for the aspirated series.

|**Lateral**||l|ʎ ⟨lj⟩||||

Your vowels were harder to do. I like your use of umlauts for central vowels, like in the IPA. I took inspiration from Korean [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean) for the unrounded back vowels; I also looked to French orthography for the open-mid vowels. The open vowels (and you really have way too many if you're trying to go for naturalism), were really hard to do, but hopefully the system I have is intuitive.

we follow your logic lad. So be it. From the ""arbitrary"" 12/13 to 16/17 timescale Juve alone did better than all English teams together.

Yes, but almost every other time period you choose shows the opposite of the point you're trying to prove. If you pick the last five games before Christmas in the PL you can show that Man City were in fact the 11th best team, Spurs were going to win the league and West Ham were going to come third. Who knew eh?

&gt;Aye, 2 finals is definitely and not just ""marginally"" better than 2 semis, and it shows that they were a bigger fish than any English team in all those years 

No, it shows England were in a downswing in that period while Germany and especially Spain were tearing it up. Let's also not forget in one of those finals Juve got trashed 4-1

&gt;and not that the Serie A just was weaker. If for you that doesn't mean nothing, I couldn't care less.  

It shows nothing whatsoever about the strength of the Serie A. Only Juve.

If you want to look at three strength of Serie A as a whole why not look at the fact in that time period Italian clubs not called Juve only reached the knockouts of the CL 4 times in five years, getting knocked out in the round of 16 every time AND Juve won every league title with a cumulative points gap over the second place team of 56 points (11.2 points per season) AND won three out of five Copa Italias. But the Serie had loads of strong teams in that time period, right?



&gt;no lad, 4 years ago *is* more time than 2 months ago, that isn't me trying to distort something, is just the reality. How is that related to ""English European performances"" when we are comparing the chances of not top teams in their respective leagues of winning something escapes my imagination.  

Yes, lad, I understand how time works. You'll also notice, lad, how choosing one season where Juve didn't win doesn't erase 7 years of total domination by Juventus of both the Serie A and the Copa Italia, lad. 


&gt;again, Leicester was great, but in the overall state of things isn't truly meaningful. 

It's meaningful in that it clearly shows the opposite of your claim that underdogs can't do well in the PL. 

&gt;Kaiserslautern and Deportivo did similar things and 20 years after, and in a easier context it hasn't repeated. You can't just obviate that.  


And you can't obviate the fact that it happened. Note also that before people would have said it was impossible for that to happen and yet here we are



&gt;and yet the league who last season had a single team winning every domestic competition wasn't the Italian

For literally the first time **ever**. Just ignore that though, doesn't fit your narrative. You'll also have to ignore yet another inconvenient fact that the league Fa Cup double has only been done three times in the 21st century whereas Juve have done it four times in the last five years. 


&gt;and *you* seem to ignore that. Your people can be completely deluded to think that City didn't already started to be what Juve has been domestically at least until Pep leaves, from outside it seems to be pretty obvious and it is funny how you still insist in using the ""league different winners"" logic to prove something even after last season.  

They won last year by a single point ffs. Yes while Pep is there City are always going to be favourites but soon enough he will get bored and leave. Also it's by no means a given they win again this year. It's notoriously hard to string together PL titles. The longest run of consecutive league titles in the entire history of the English first Division going back to 1889 is three in a row that's only happened four times in 130 years. Compare that to the Serie A where you have a run of **8** Juve title wins (I actually fucked up before and undersold how ridiculously one-sided it is) preceded by a run of five Inter wins on the bounce with a Milan win sandwiched in the middle



&gt;Lazio is winning the Coppa, Atalanta reaching the final and getting CL football, Wolves is finishing 7th. Everybody have chances of anything, but the difference between them are immense.  

The difference between them is next to nothing. Wolves were less than a minute from an FA Cup final last season. It's also funny you bring up Atalanta since the parallels between them and Wolves are actually very obvious. A team that for most of their history have been in-between the first and second division (in fact Wolves have more pedigree) now making a push up the table with a new, more ambitious goal



&gt;If you think that a player should value more finishing 7th in the PL just because it is the PL instead of winning a domestic Cup and getting CL football in a top league, mate, *you* are the biased delusional.  

Jesus Christ are you being deliberately dense. There are so many more factors than this pointless binary choice you're laying out. Is the player going to play or be benched? Is the coach good? Are the club on the up? Is the club playing in a competitive environment? How much is the wage? Is the style of play right? All these are questions that should be asked ahead of ""what chance is there of winning a domestic cup"", given how random and sporadic those things are. The only way of guaranteeing a chance at cup success is to join the very best team


&gt;&gt;They're a slightly bigger team in a smaller pond. Wolves are absolutely on the up too  
&gt;  
&gt;Wolves are the top of what?


I didn't say anything about Wolves being the top of anything. Wtf are you jabbering on about now?

&gt;Burnley did the same than then the season before and then they weren't able to even reach the EL groups stage. That's their kind of level, not anything else. Ah, but let me guess, here comes the verbiage about how because of completely arbitrary reasons and biased reasoning both cases aren't comparable and Wolves is in fact of the same tier than a team that wins Cups and goes far in the EL.  

Oh, right I see. It's not an act. You really are that dumb. It's so painfully obvious you don't watch either Wolves or Burnley. The differences are so unbelievably obvious to anyone that has actually watched them. If you want objective stats, Burnley massively overperformed their expected points (by 13 points) and while they were very impressive to finish 7th, they ""should"" have finished 14th, and before you tell me Burnley always overperform in expected points, they actually underpoerformed by two points last season and only overperformed by 1.6 points in 16/18. Wolves on the other hand underpoerformed last season and finished 6th in the expected points table. In other words Burnley were always going to drop off whereas Wolves are likely to push on. 




&gt;A player has more chances of winning something in a Lazio kind of team than in a not-top 6 English team.

For the umpteenth time, players should not be choosing clubs on the off chance of winning a domestic cup because they happen so sporadically unless you're a very big team. Even if that was a sensible criteria England is still the better bet becsuse you've also got the chance of winning the League Cup


&gt;Lazio is bigger both historically and presently than Wolves. 

Not really though, it's pretty tit for tat, Wolves have won more league titles, Lazio have won more domestic cups and have a European trophy, but then Wolves have reached the final of the same competition and get bigger attendances nowadays (despite a much smaller stadium.


&gt;Finishing 7th in the PL is definitely far less impressive than winning domestic cups 

Winning domestic cups is like the icing on the cake of a season. If you have a shit cake icing it doesn't make it less shit. For example is Wigan winning the Fa Cup and getting related in the same season more impressive than finishing 7th in the league? No clearly not

&gt;or getting CL football in other top leagues. 

Something Lazio have done once since 06/07 and even then they lost the playoff and played in the Europa League anyway.

If you're talking more generally, there are very few clubs if any in top leagues that regularly get CL football where Cutrone would play more than he is likely to at Wolves so they are poor choices

&gt;Juve from 12/13 to the rise of Liverpool and Man City was a bigger fish than any English team as the international performances prove.  

Ok great. So what? In a very specific time period Juve was slightly stronger than the top English teams but Serie A was still far less competitive as a whole as evidenced by the lack of success from every other team. Also in every recent time period before or since England was stronger


&gt;if highlighting how absurd the situation is becoming because of the financial disparity between leagues, with minions like Wolves or Fullham spending more than CL clubs, so be it, I have such chip. I'm sorry for not just praising you while you destroy the rest of football, but ask yourself, wouldn't you do the same if you were in our position and not in the privileged one?

You're also just ignoring the silly spending that goes on in Italy (mainly Juve), by PSG, and in Spain by the big clubs.

Since before her birth, Bogdana Cometopoulos, was destined for greatness. Fate would see her rise to become Bogdana the Hammer, Empress of Bulgaria and Shield of Christendom, and lose it all in the name of love. 

So basically, playing as her grandfather, I got two duchies in Byzantium through a war with Byz. The firstborn son was supposed to inherit, however after two failed marriages and five other children, I got a genius son, younger by about 10 years. Of course, I had to get the genius elected, but I felt really bad for the first son, as I had promised him those lands even going into the war (kind of an internal Mufasa ""all lands under the sun"" kinda deal). So after my genius inherited I made sure to keep an eye out for that guy's kids, and I promised myself I would give them all the duchies I conquer from the other Bulgarian dukes when I eventually usurp the kingdom, and I eventually do so.

Enter the tragic story of Bogdana and Gergana. Gergana was the child of that firstborn son I mentioned earlier, matrilinearly married to a younger, attractive rando and was given a duchy of her own, bordering my demesne (duchies around Constantinople and Thessaloniki were mine), as per the promise. She had already had several children, and was nearing old age as Bogdana ascended to the throne of Bulgaria. Bogdana was the youngest of her siblings, but was born a child of destiny, so she had to inherit. Both of them became great friends, and I gave Gergana another duchy after a cute flavor event happened between them. But this is where things turn sour. As Bogdana went on a rampage through Europe, slaughtering the pagans and infidels (she was Catholic, wanted to try new crusades in Holy Fury) and earning her the moniker of Bogdana the Hammer, she grew lonely and found solace in the arms of Gergana's husband, who himself grew tired of his now old and infertile wife.

Now here is where things get fucked up. Gergana finds out about the affair and promptly proceeds to go apeshit. They become bitter rivals, and Gergana starts conquering every other vassal in the kingdom (mostly her own brothers/nephews) and fucking up my nice meticulously laid out setup. As I'm busy crusading for Jerusalem, I don't even notice her gaining so much power, until I return to find she has basically given all the shit she conquered to her one unlanded son. Bogdana herself has only three kids, one of whom dies of smallpox, and the other die under suspicious circumstances. Gergana, now nearing 60, challenges Bogdana, in her thirties, with 26 martial skill, a skilled duelist, to a duel. The decrepit bitch with a personal combat skill of exactly 0 actually kills my goddamn child of destiny. I have no children of my own left at this point, as I was too busy conquering and had no time for pregnancy. Her son was the most powerful Duke in the kingdom, and was easily elected Emperor of Bulgaria. I wasn't even mad, that was some next level shit.

https://www.reuters.com/article/r-bosch-batteries/update-2-bosch-shuns-battery-cell-production-in-blow-to-europe-idUSL8N1QI56P

Incidentally, I can guess without knowing anything about Germany that CATL's German gigafactory will be in a former area of East Germany.  Think about why.

&gt; Bosch had said it would only consider making battery cells if there was a chance it could capture a fifth of that market by 2030, a move it said would require about 20 billion euros ($24 billion) of investment to create 200 gigawatt hours of capacity ...

&gt; The company said it was therefore halting its research into cell technologies which had cost it in the region of 500 million euros, and dissolved the Lithium Energy and Power GmbH &amp; Co. KG (LEAP) joint venture for lithium-ion technology.

&gt; Bosch also plans to sell U.S. start-up Seeo Inc. which it bought in 2015 to enhance its expertise in next-generation lithium-ion batteries ...

Meanwhile there is a claim that to get support as one of China's champions, it was required that CATL first get rid of any foreign investment:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-batteries-idUSKBN14E0K1

&gt; To become a Chinese champion, a battery maker must first shed any foreign investment to be eligible for subsidies and other policy support, people in the industry say.

Also in China, Japanese and Korean companies were doing well at selling batters in China.   Until:

https://roskill.com/news/batteries-whats-driving-the-momentum-of-catl/

&gt; Based on their mature ternary lithium-ion battery technologies, Japanese and Korean battery makers entered the Chinese market with a cost advantage in 2015. Prices for ternary lithium-ion batteries were as low as RMB1/Wh (US$0.16/Wh). As a result, Japanese and Korean battery makers won many orders from mainstream carmakers. Until 2016, **China released a “white list” of qualified vehicles that were eligible for subsidies, which effectively eliminated competition from Japanese and Korean battery makers. CATL has since become the largest beneficiary of these subsidies**.

Pictures of Whaling Scenes.

&gt;But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon
the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not
draw so good a one.

&gt;**In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian
cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the
small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the
Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while
the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in
admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the
drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of
a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily
hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.**

&gt;Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for
painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder
fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of
France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the
successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea
battle-pieces of Garnery.",True,False,False,,0,1564627932,,False,0,{},evnmtfq,False,t3_ckdafw,False,True,t3_ckdafw,/r/mobydick/comments/ckdafw/can_anyone_remember_the_passage_about_this/evnmtfq/,False,,1573380291,2,True,[],False,mobydick,t5_2vqmx,r/mobydick,public,0,

When it became clear that the West was too impotent to act (and likely just wanted the Germans to wipe out communism first), Soviet policy was forced to change from containment to proactive defense. For the next two years after WW2 began, the Soviet Union began creating a large militarized border that would hopefully either dissuade or slow down a German invasion.

&gt;and which lead to both countries invading Poland. Russia also invaded Finland and the Baltic States, as agreed upon in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

Have you ever considered that these nations were the main points of entry into the Soviet Union during *Operation Barbarossa*? This was a move necessary to slow or prevent a German invasion.

If you're looking at stuff on the side, there will always be cinema. For all I said at the start I have zero fear that artful cinema will go away. I'm skeptical about wide-release stuff - like I doubt there will be another *2001 A Space Odessey* in theatres any time soon - but single screen and arthouse theatres will always have their place.

And if you want to see weird movies with a voice, there's a special place in my heart for Bruce LaBruce - the punk Canuxploitation arthouse sociopolitical gay porno auteur. That sounds ridiculous but seriously someone yelling Marx quotes while getting fucked in an elevator was just... art. If you're into the kinds of movies that Jay loves and Mike hates, that is. Weirdo cinematographers will always be out there. There will always be Lynches and Waters' and Cronenburgs, but just like them the future ones will only be featured on a limited number of screens. I'm not worried about cinema and art going away, but I am worried about the dumbing down of society and how these films don't sneak in anymore. It wasn't the urban fantasy / magical realism of *Les Revenants* that appealed to me btw... it was that old French cinema style of patient, slow, careful story-telling. They were in no rush, but it was never boring, and the camera occasionally made it clear that you were a voyeur on these lives. It was just as much about how the show was put together from a technical standpoint as it was the story itself and the characters and how they were portrayed.

I actually have seen *Beau Séjour* and *Dark*, both before they hit Netflix as I keep an eye on the internationals (and on that note *Please Like Me* should be more watched than it was). In terms of slow, artful pacing and that European sensibility the online series *The Outs* wowed me with its pacing and its absolute refusal to engage in any exposition. It was basically a whodunnit about two exes where you reconstruct from basically eavesdropping what happened between them (and later you find out exactly how you're wrong). The thing that wowed me the most about *The Outs* was it felt European but was made in NYC.

Faço uso de antidepressivos há uns 3 anos mais ou menos. Sim, no começo é complicado o ajuste da dose, e quando você melhorar o desmame é bem gradativo (você não pode simplesmente parar de tomar).

Vá ao psiquiatra, continue fazendo terapia e não deixe de tomar seus remédios, nem um dia sequer. Você vai ver como vai se sentir melhor em pouco tempo. No meu caso, senti bem a diferença, e quem convive comigo também.

Não fique nessa noia de “ah vou viciar, vou ficar dependente”. Você já tá mal, o remédio é um caminho para você melhorar. Depende do grau da depressão, da ansiedade.

Pollarding, a pruning system involving the removal of the upper branches of a tree, promotes a dense head of foliage and branches. In ancient Rome, Propertius mentioned pollarding during the 1st century BCE. The practice occurred commonly in Europe since medieval times, and takes place today in urban areas worldwide, primarily to maintain trees at a determined height.Traditionally, people pollarded trees for one of two reasons: for fodder to feed livestock or for wood. Fodder pollards produced ""pollard hay"" for livestock feed; they were pruned at intervals of two to six years so their leafy material would be most abundant. Wood pollards were pruned at longer intervals of eight to fifteen years, a pruning cycle tending to produce upright poles favored for fence rails and posts and boat construction.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me explain ....

&amp;#x200B;

Obama was primarily judged by his polices, his leadership and other peer-based criticisms as an equal over political divides and with the same historical vitriol that has been present since the very first days of our nation and in many of our presidential elections since George Washington.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite a rise of preference for collective policies/ideas during Obama's tenure among Millennials and coastal/blue-urban spot citizens, most of America still remains individualist/liberty driven.

&amp;#x200B;

The citizenship thing was never race based, we have been going back and forth with each other over 'natural born citizen' for generations.

&amp;#x200B;

In Obama's case most of it was due his communist upbringing. Communist were notorious liars/scam artist back in the day to get benefits and live off the state. This was increased by the sealing of his records and a book in which the literary agent claimed he was from Kenya too.  Andy Martin is credited with being the founder of birtherism surrounding Obama.

&amp;#x200B;

Another person who has faced similar scrutiny is Tea Party favorite  Senator Ted Cruz who also has his records sealed so that no one can verify if his mother filed the paperwork required at the time to be a citizen vs gaining citizenship through amnesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also in 2008 when McCain ran against Obama, there were questions as to whether he should be seen as a natural born citizen having been born on a US base in Panama

&amp;#x200B;

For 2020 our 'birther natural born-citizen' candidate is Tulsi Gabbard who was born in American Samoa to American parents.

&amp;#x200B;

No our nation isn't founded upon racism, regions vary in their social evolution, the more assimilated ethnic/racial/religious diversity the less anyone cares, the less ethnic/racial/religious diverse or if multicultural diverse is employed the more us/them mentality persists. This is why we embrace assimilated individualist-liberty which produces E pluribus unum  over collectivism or multiculturalism. Our incarceration rates reflect corrupt elites who enjoy profiting from the misery of others, it is easier to target and experiment on minority populations (which led to increased incarceration rates) before expanding them to the white majority. 

&amp;#x200B;

 At this time only a little over 900 children remain separated due to various reasons including derelict parent(s) or those seeking legal counsel with their parents to become UACs. 

The other factor in separation was whether a family presented themselves as a refugee legally at a port of entry and are rarely separated vs unlawful entry which was an automatic separation. We have laws, no one is above the law. Those who illegally cross into our nation put their children at risk through criminal behavior no different than a citizen who has their child present when arrested for a crime. Once a refugee made it to Mexico they were technically safe,  AmLO after all is a socialist president, has offered generous options and Mexico is set on a path of progressive revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

The largest population of children in custody are UACs (unaccompanied alien children) this number as of June for the 2019 fiscal year is 63,624. We are required by law (2008 bill sponsored by California Democratic Party Rep. Dianne Feinstein) to process these children at a much slower rate over trafficking precautions.

&gt; Tensions between the US and Iran have heightened since the US last year withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal that aimed to curb Iranian nuclear activities.

&gt; On Wednesday, the US extended waivers which allow Russia, China and European countries to continue civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran.

&gt; &amp;quot;At the same time the Iranian regime denies Iranian citizens&amp;#039; access to social media, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif spreads the regime&amp;#039;s propaganda and disinformation around the world through these mediums,&amp;quot; Mr Mnuchin said.

&gt; Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&amp;B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.

&gt; Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike ""The Man"" Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as ""The Man"" was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably ""We Care a Lot"", which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and ""We Are the World"".

&gt; The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of ""creative differences."" In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band's internal relationships had descended into ""pathological hatred"". Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the ""whipping boy"" of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.

&gt; Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group's first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

&gt; Patton's astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling—usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on ""Epic"" and the sleazy jazz vocals of ""Edge Of the World"" (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as ""a pair of lungs on legs.""

&gt; The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as ""not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic."" The video for ""Epic"", which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1).

&gt; Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is ""one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,"" and another writes that ""'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers … reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.""  Angel Dust featured the singles ""Midlife Crisis"" and ""A Small Victory"", as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic ""Easy"", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U.S., sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of ""Easy"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U.K., South America, Europe and Australia.

&gt; After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N' Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band's most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U.K., Germany and Australia. In the U.S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1.5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles ""Gentle Art Of Making Enemies"" and ""Take This Bottle"", and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of ""King For A Day."" It's been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived...Patton doesn't drive any more. Patton comments, ""Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. ...We had to look at lot of things in the face...it was nice.""

&gt; 
Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U.S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Last Cup Of Sorrow"" had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad ""Stripsearch"" was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). ""She Loves Me Not"" was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up.

&gt; On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band's growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide.

&gt; Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantômas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996).

&gt; Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks ""Falling To Pieces"" and ""The Perfect Crime"" were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey respectively.

&gt; On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009.  The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press  release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM.com. 

&gt; Th 10-song album Sol Invictus was released May 19, 2015.

This is a time period that the Hapsburgs were burning whole villages at the stake due to religion and politics. It's a level of brutality that completely fit that of the rest of Europe at the time, and instances of Hungarians fighting with Muslims against another faction of Christianity was not such a massive break from tradition or as shocking as all the weird and disturbing and non-traditional things going on all over Europe at the time. You might as well wonder why the English beheaded their king for suspected crypto-catholicism, or why in Russia people were striving for martyrdom over disagreements about how many fingers to hold up during prayer, or any or the long list of incredibly bizarre things happening in German cities during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if you mean that the Hapsburgs starting seeing Hungary differently? There were always some Hungarians on their side as well, though, as loyalists due to political rivalries with aristocrats on the independent claimant's side, or family ties to the Hapsburgs, or promise of wealth from them, or just plain catholic unity.

Ironic.

&gt;shifted focus away from the fact that slavery still exists and always had.

It's almost like it's now illegal in the majority of the world, and most English speaking nations are related to Europe is some way. Sure it's always existed in various forms, but there's only two that were on the same scale as the trans-Atlantic slave trade. And only one of those was caused by Europeans reshaping markets to provide a way for them to buy slaves.

&gt;Maybe think about the impact of your pathetic paternalism for a change.

That word, it does not mean what you think it means. Sellers only exist when there is a buyer, so if slavers exists it is the fault of the groups who buy them, this does not absolve the seller, but it also doesn't do what you are trying to do and shift blame away from people making use of slavery.

There were some scattered tribes living here before the Europeans arrived but they never set borders even around their living locations; much less around the whole territory that corresponds to the U.S., so they never took ownership of the land.

The Indians didn't have open borders; they really had NO borders at all. They didn't even know how large or small a land the area around their tribes was. They had no country and they had developed nothing in this land.

All tribes weren't even united. They fought against and killed each other all the time. Indians never claimed the whole territory of what is the U.S. today.  
If we put together all the area actually occupied by Indian tribes at that time, the total square footage of Indian-occupied land back then might be comparable to the total area designated as Indian land today throughout the U.S.

The Indians were only conquered in the sense that they were forcibly relocated, but there was at least a concern from the ""conquerors"" about recognizing that the Indians were here when the Europeans arrived and that they had the right to remain here, so land was preserved for them. 

Leftards are pathetic &amp; dumb. Explorers got here AT THE END OF THE 1400s (when the whole of the world was still unknown and still being explored &amp; settled) and found a mostly uninhabited and completely undeveloped land, and they put in the very hard work to make it into a country and bring development to it - without depending on anything the Indians had built or depending on the Indians to maintain them and their families or to make their lives better (at best they got advice from Indians on how to grow a specific crop or something like that). But leftards want to compare these brave explorers and settlers who started the path into making the U.S. into the most powerful and best country in the world to people invading an established nation that has internationally recognized borders (like every other country in the planet has had for a very long time now), not to build anything new or even to significantly contribute to what has already been built, but to take advantage of the wealth and development which they weren't able to build in their own countries and to take from the hard-working American people in the form of social benefits and/or by bringing chaos and crime.

Besides all of this, if it hadn't been the European, it would have been another people to arrive here and settle in this area, such as the Asians or worse; the Muslims - then the Indians would have been completely genocided, which the European didn't do.  There were fights in which Indians and Europeans or Americans killed each other, and many Indians died from illness, especially during the long journey (Trail of Tears) they were forced to go on towards the new area reserved for them in the west, but the White man didn't ever just put Indians against the wall and shot them for entertainment or to eliminate all Indians and ""steal"" all ""their"" land, which by the way, hadn't been theirs since humans started inhabiting the Earth.

We know there were people here before the Indians, such as the people who created and lived in the ancient city of Cahokia, which was located near what is now St. Louis and is estimated to have been vastly populated by tens of thousands of people until about 1350. 

The Indians aren't ""native"" to America either.

This stems from the primary loophole where devs **cannot delete apps** from Google Play.  All they can do is **Unpublish** - which just removes app's visibility to new viewers, while it remains visible for previous users.

Since those apps were published under previous rules, and it is Google who changes goalposts every year, it is essentially exacting **developer manpower without compensation**, and on compulsion.

The primary motivator for this, or the **source of this hidden power** for Google is their secretive (hidden rules) and much feared app ban, and subsequent developer ban (when too many app bans pile up, the dev will get banned).

Essentially, we are seeing the exercise of market dominance in action - because developers don't have recourse to another platform (once they are android specialists), and because app bans and developer bans happen in a climate of secrecy and obfuscation (we have many examples of such misbehavior by Google - defending Google because they have a difficult job with millions of apps/devs is not a burden an ordinary dev should bear - that falls directly on Google).

As a result Google leverages the nuisance factor to exact **greater compliance from devs** than Google could ordinarily exact in normal business dealings with devs.

In this way **Google's practices veer dangerously close to the practices of the Mafia**.

Unspoken rules threaten dire consequence  which are not spelled out explicitly in Google documents (or are spelled out years later as in this example) - and compliance is assured by a silent underlying threat of lifetime ban for the dev.  Given Google's all-pervasive presence now in everyone's lives, this means Google punches beyond it's reasonable weight - as a ban by Google has far wider implications than just a couple of app bans.

As it stands right now, a dev dealing with Google faces more extreme threat of action than if that dev was dealing with a smaller company.

This is an excellent reason to have a regulatory split of Google, **so Android behaves as a separate company**, instead of operating on the strategic goals of an all-encompassing search/user-tracking company that will eventually be seen as a threat - a territory that Facebook has already entered.  And which Google will eventually enter, given their history of such practices.

Google apologists will say this is a compulsion of Google's business model - they cannot be expected to deal equitably with millions of apps/devs.  Oddly such a leeway is not afforded to devs.  Google owns the business model, and benefits from it.  They should also be held accountable for it, and should not be considered too powerful that their business partners operate under an atmosphere of compulsion.

Here is some background on how the ""associated account bans"" work - a company can get banned, because their developer has a friend who got banned.  Is this the behavior of an above-board company ?

&gt; The Pretty Things are a 1960s and 1970s rock and roll band from London. They pioneered a raw approach to rhythm and blues (and later, psychedelia) that influenced a number of key bands of the 1960s British invasion, particularly The Rolling Stones, and David Bowie whose first hero was Phil May.

&gt; Pretty Things was preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. When Brian Jones joined Little Boy Blue and the Blues Boys as guitarist, Taylor was pushed from playing guitar to bass and the Rolling Stones were formed.

&gt; Several months later Dick Taylor (born Richard Clifford Taylor, 28 January 1943, in Dartford, Kent) quit the newly formed Rolling Stones to pursue his schooling when he was accepted at London Central School of Art, where he met up with Phil May (born Phillip Arthur Dennis Kattner, on 9 November 1944, in Dartford, Kent) and they formed Pretty Things.

&gt; Taylor was once again playing his preferred guitar with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited Brian Pendleton (born 13 April 1944 in Wolverhampton–died 16 May 2001 in Maidstone, Kent) on rhythm guitar; John Stax (born John Edward Lee Fullegar, 6 April 1944 in Crayford, Kent) on bass; and, after trying a couple of different drummers, including Pete Kitley and Viv Andrews, stuck with Viv Prince (born Vivian St John Prince, 9 August 1944, in Loughborough, Leices).

&gt; Early career

&gt; They caused a sensation in England, and their first three singles — ""Rosalyn"" #41, ""Don't Bring Me Down"" #10, and the self-penned ""Honey I Need"" at #13 — appeared in the UK singles chart in 1964-1965. They never had a hit in the United States, but had considerable success in their native United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands in the middle of the decade. However, in the U.S. they, along with The Yardbirds and Van Morrison's Them, were a huge influence on hundreds of garage bands, including the MC5 and The Seeds.

&gt; Their early material was hard-edged blues-rock influenced by Bo Diddley (they took their name from Diddley's 1955 song ""Pretty Thing"" in humorous contrast to their unkempt long-haired appearance) and Jimmy Reed, much like that of their contemporaries The Stones and The Yardbirds. They were known for wild ""rock and roll"" behaviour and shocking the establishment; their song ""Midnight to Six Man"" defined the mod lifestyle. Around this time, the first of what would be many personnel changes over the years also began, with Prince the first to go late in 1965. He was replaced by Skip Alan. Pendleton left late in 1966, and was not initially replaced. Then, Stax quit early in 1967 and Jon Povey and Wally Waller joined to make the band a five piece once again.

&gt; After an uncomfortable flirtation with mainstream pop on the Emotions album in 1967, they embraced psychedelia, producing the groundbreaking concept album S.F. Sorrow during 1967-68. This album, released in late 1968, is arguably one of the first rock operas, preceding The Who's Tommy by about a year. It was recorded in the legendary Abbey Road Studios six months after The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Each album shares a similar forward-thinking late-1960s psychedelic sound (as well as sharing the same record producer, Norman Smith, as the Floyd). S.F. Sorrow was followed by the highly-acclaimed record album Parachute, which continued the psychedelic sound and was named ""Album of the Year"" in 1970 by Rolling Stone Magazine. During this period they also recorded an album for a young French millionaire, Philippe DeBarge, which was intended only to be circulated among the man's social circle. The acetate has since been bootlegged.

&gt; Later career

&gt; From this point on, the group enjoyed less in the way of commercial success, but the devotion of a strong cult following, especially with critics and other rock musicians. Their material in the early 1970s tended towards more the hard rock and early heavy metal end of the spectrum, although still blues-based, on albums like Silk Torpedo. 1980's Cross Talk saw them incorporating influences of punk and New Wave into their hard rock sound; like most of their records, it was an artistic but not a commercial success.

&gt; With a new manager, Mark St John, they gigged sporadically during the 1980s. By the end of the decade their profile had almost disappeared, when founder members Phil May and Dick Taylor reformed the band for a successful European blues tour in late 1990 with Stan Webb's Chicken Shack and Luther Allison. This gigging outfit included drummer Hans Waterman (formerly of Dutch rock group Solution), bassist Roelf ter Velt and guitarist/keyboardist Barkley McKay (Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonaut's with Jon Langford of Mekon Fame). This line up regularly toured the European mainland playing a revitalised set that show cased their earlier, rootsy blues and r'n'b materiel, until late 1994. By 1995, they reformed the Cross Talk line-up and added Frank Holland on guitar in place of Peter Tolson. Their label, Snapper Music, issued remastered CDs with many bonus tracks, plus a DVD of a re-recording of S.F. Sorrow at Abbey Road Studios (with Dave Gilmour &amp; Arthur Brown guesting). They toured more frequently, including a tour of the U.S. for the first time in decades

&gt; Original rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton died of lung cancer on May 16, 2001.

&gt; In the early 2000's, they released new recordings, including a live album and the studio album Rage Before Beauty.

&gt; In 2003, Alan Lakey's biography of the band, Growing Old Disgracefully, was published by Firefly. The book dealt with the long and involved history of the band, and paid special attention to the legal proceedings issued against EMI in the 1990s.

To elaborate:    
Experts at UK in a Changing Europe [told us](https://fullfact.org/europe/no-deal-divorce-bill-legally-obligated-pay/) in February that, under international law, it’s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice. The European Commission [has said](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-743_en.htm) that in a no deal scenario, it would still expect the UK to “honour all commitments made during EU membership”. 

So yes, I think the UK will still pay money to the EU if only to smooth over any future deal, as I said, a divorce between nations does not mean that all obligations stop as well.

Because you wrote about how industrial society = post-industrial society. pre-industrial = primary. industrial = secondary. post-industrial = tertiary. That is how modern economies evolve..?

We both agree early stage capitalism is good, where ownership is widely distributed, it's mostly meritocratic etc. That's why I want to recreate a similar society where everyone can get what they deserve and earn through meritocracy rather than having this borderless, debt ridden, consumer hellhole with no purpose where people are reduced to homo economicus by both sets of materialists (marxists and capitalists). I seek to give people back their sovereignty and purpose in life, the ONLY way to do that is to rein in the corporations, which libertarian policies do NOT do.

I also would put major limitations on unproductive economic activity, this includes usury, speculation and other forms of profiteering which don't involve the profiteer providing anything useful.

&gt;Ah, but China and Russia and Africa and India etc. never really could catch up, could they? The irony that our economic competitors after WWII were Germany and Japan, two nations subject to increased capitalism even as America's capitalist system was receding! We imposed a freedom on both that made them the second and third most productive economies by the 1980s!

Alright cool, so the GDP increased, is that all that matters? What good is a high GDP if the average man's relative wealth decreases? All it means is that the rich are getting richer, while the 99.99% are getting poorer. No one is claiming that a command economy increases GDP more than a market economy. Although with the advancements in technology today I'm sure the government could monitor markets just as well as capitalists do. We have controlled economies now, most of the differences in GDP and such are due to Finance IE speculation. The trading of stocks, bonds, currencies etc. None of these things are physical, they are abstract and speculative, therefore it is possible for economic agents to manipulate markets quite easily. For example after Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't ban holocaust deniers from facebook their stocks plummeted the next day, what does that tell you? Rich speculators want holocaust denial banned from facebook of course, perhaps because they are Jewish and it offends them or whatever. I'm sure you'll say it's grassroots and millions of regular joes traded in their stocks because they heard the BIG NEWS from Zuck and thought facebook was going to implode after such a catastrophic horrible PR move, lol.

I would also say that I think the brilliance of Western Europeans far outweights all the others you mentioned. If you've ever read 'Human Accomplishment' by Charles Murray, you'll know that 97% of all innovations and advancements in literally every major field have come from Western Europeans. Mostly from Britain, Germany, France and Italy.

&gt;Ah, but ""what does it matter?"" It matters because the relevant distinction for all of this is political and economic freedom!

I don't doubt that 'economic freedom' increases GDP. I just doubt that increases in GDP increases wellbeing for the ordinary man, the evidence over the past 50 years tells us otherwise. You need the government to put restraints on the power of the rich otherwise they will keep enriching themselves at the cost of everyone else. It's pretty simple:

- Inflation is let's say 2% per year

- Businesses' profit must outpace inflation and increase the margin to please shareholders

This means businesses increase profit margin by

- Improvements in technology, efficiency of workers etc

- Importing new workers to replace your current ones for less wages

[Wages have stagnated whilst inflation has continued, this means in real terms wages have depreciated.](https://imgur.com/a/l1cwMLy), property, healthcare, education etc have all increased in price at a much quicker rate than inflation too. America's productivity is constantly increasing but the average man is constantly getting poorer. What libertarian policies change this? There are none, libertarian policies are geared towards increasing GDP which doesn't matter whatsoever to the 99.99%. Why the fuck would I care how George Soros, the Koch Brothers, the Sacklers etc are doing on the stock markets? I care about how much my wages that never increase in value are worth, I'm working harder and producing more yet I'm earning less? Why? Sure you can look down your nose on me because you're so much smarter than me for googling a Socrates quote and scoff because I'm just not an intellectual powerhouse like you that can pick up valuable skills and whatnot. But how does that help the average Joe keep his kids fed? Just 10 years ago his minimum wage job was fine when the kids were babies but now his wages are worth 20% less in real terms even though he's earning his business way more money. What do you tell him? It's his own fault for not somehow magically beating a rigged system right? Really meritocratic.

&gt;You can't even entertain this idea because you have such a biased narrative against capitalism, and such confusion about what capitalism is and is not, that you insist on one set of cause-and-effect. You insist on your narrative even when I try to confront you with a historical reality that directly contradicts it.

This again, how many times have I asked you to define and/or explain your terms? You have refused to explain literally anything. You refuse to engage with reality even.

&gt;Trying to open your mind to any other possibility is a fool's errand, and my attempt here has only resulted in you insisting I haven't explained ""anything"" or ""backed up a single point."" There is no explaining anything to someone with your kind of childish dogmatism.

Go on and explain how removing the government from the equation will increase the wages of the average man. The businesses will keep importing cheap labour, they'll keep outsourcing, they'll keep not increasing wages, they'll keep subverting any attempts at unionising etc ad infinitum. How exactly will saving them the money they use to bribe politicians help anything? The conditions will be the exact same.

The reason why some bills forbid private insurance is because M4A will include pretty much all essential benefits, which is something that Germany and Canada don't do for example. in these countries, people buy private insurance if they want access to these benefits.

The EU declares war in response. The Secretary of Defense resigns.

The UK tries to debate its way out of joining the war (""but we're almost out anyway"") until Trump decides to bomb Jersey, believing it to be part of Spain. Brexit is canceled so the UK can focus on demonstrating the virtues of the Royal Navy to the Americans. The new Secretary of Defense resigns.

The Democrats try to remove Donald Trump from office on grounds of being utterly insane but are blocked by the Republicans on grounds of ""it was a Democrat idea so we we'll oppose it on principle"". The new Secretary of Defense resigns.

Meanwhile, Germany switches to a war economy to equip and mobilize its troops, promising to make at least ten ships and up to fifteen tanks available within the next five years. Ammunition for the ships and tanks is expected to be available by mid-2030.

America tries to get its various allies around the Middle East to join the war but quickly find its doesn't actually have any after a pre-emptive bombing run is made on Golan instead of Iran, killing Israeli troops and causing Israel to angrily declare neutrality in the war. Five hours into his tenure the new Secretary of Defense accepts full responsibility and resigns. Saudi Arabia declines to comment; rumors from sources close to Salman ibn Abd al-Aziz say it's because ""he just couldn't stop laughing"".

After tweeting that he'd launch nukes to ""Kill all the Hitlers in Europe! #MAGA"" Trump attempts to authorize the deployment of the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States against the city of Malmö, Sweden, but is stopped because Europe hasn't actually gone on the offense and he thus needs the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Due to new Secretaries of Defense resigning within minutes of being nominated the office is currently incapable of approving anything.

Ordered to ""do everything to shut off the European gas"", American commando units destroy large parts of Gazprom's infrastructure. Angrily, Russia declares war on the USA. Several high-ranking American generals resign, leaving the military leadership in disarray.

Russia's only aircraft carrier suddenly takes on water and sinks, crippling Russia's ability to participate in the war. In a bid to save face Russia relegates itself to cyberwar, with the most successful campaign being a concerted Twitter trolling effort against the American president.

The Democrats are officially considering using assassins to remove Trump from office. The Republicans counter by showing up in explosive vests, promising to suicide bomb both the Senate and the House if Trump is killed. Control of the American military has been delegated to the Interim Command Sergeant Major of the Army Reserve, being the highest-ranking member of the military left. He is considering resignation.

Germany pushes back the timeline on its war readiness as it turns out that the diesel engines on both the tanks and the ships fail current emission standards due to defeat devices being present during certification. However, the Bundeswehr can now supply up to 500 fully armed soldiers, provided none of them needs to go through more than two magazines.

The Royal Navy returns from an attack on the USA. Due to lack of planning the ships had actually departed without any ammunition; however, in an accidental collision with a boat of the United States Coast Guard the Navy technically inflicted more damage than it received and thus the Tories sell the excursion as ""a rousing success"". When Trump demands to know where the US Navy was he is told that all ship captains had already resigned, leaving the ships unable to leave port.

Jared Kushner is instated as captain of the USS Nimitz. Within a week he manages to run it ashore on Liberty Island. He attempts to fire his entire crew, only to be told that ""discharge doesn't work that way"". The crew resigns nonetheless.

Donald Trump passes an executive order to confiscate all guns in America to equip the US Army because ""they'd be more effective if they had more guns"". The Republicans immediately move to impeach him. The Democrats oppose on grounds of ""it was a Republican idea so we we'll oppose it on principle"" but relent when the Republicans offer to legalize cannabis for incarcerated Americans in return for cooperation.

After the fastest impeachment process in history Donald Trump is convicted of five dozen charges and kicked out of the White House. The USA and the EU agree to a peaceful settlement, not mentioning once that both belligerents are unable to continue the war – the USA because they have no soldiers left in service and the EU because Italy has somehow managed to ""misplace"" the entire European war fund.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated calls for easier monetary policy may not be what drove the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday. 

&gt; But Trump’s policies did set the table for it. 

&gt; His aggressive tactics on trade, including 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods that prompted retaliatory duties on U.S. exports, have made companies uncertain about the future and more hesitant to invest. 

&gt; The Fed’s beige book, a collection of economic anecdotes from around the country, now regularly features an escalating and eclectic collection of trade-related impacts. 

&gt; In the edition circulated ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, a company in the Northeast complaining about the cost of keeping track of tariffs and a West Virginia rubber manufacturer saying trade wars had hurt demand from Chinese customers were among dozens of examples. 

&gt; The impact is in the hard data as well. A report last week showing the U.S. economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the second quarter featured the first drop in business investment since 2016, and trade overall was a net drag on growth. 

&gt; And it is one factor in the global manufacturing chill, exacerbating weakness from longstanding factors like aging demographics in Europe and Japan. 

&gt; Trade uncertainty, weak business investment, and sluggish growth abroad were the three main reasons cited by Fed Chair Jerome Powell for cutting rates on Wednesday to between 2.00% and 2.25%. 

&gt; “The trade war has been disruptive to the global economy and it’s created a feedback loop” that poses a risk to U.S. growth, said Eric Winograd, Senior U.S. Economist at AllianceBernstein. 

&gt; Fed policymakers “are responding primarily to risks, and most of the risks to which they are responding are coming out of the administration.” 

&gt; At the same time, Winograd said, there’s nothing usual about White House policies impacting the economy. Tax cuts by George W. Bush, tax hikes under George H. W. Bush, and government spending under Barack Obama are among examples under prior presidents, he said. 

&gt; Some risks to which the Fed’s rate cut is meant to respond are not of Trump’s making. 

&gt; Chief among these is low inflation, which Powell also said was a factor in the Fed’s rate cut decision in remarks to reporters on Wednesday afternoon following the committee’s action. Slow rising prices predate Trump’s tenure by years and is at least in part driven by global competition and technological innovation. Trade tariffs if anything tend to raise prices, at least temporarily. 

&gt; And while Trump’s tax cuts last year triggered faster-than-expected growth in the economy, sparking concern from some Fed officials about a slowdown once the tax break boost waned, consumer spending has stayed strong, surging at a 4.3% annual rate in the second quarter. 

&gt; Still, the Fed’s rate cut is at least in part a response to Trump’s actions, if not to his words. 

&gt; But the president wants more, and after Powell’s press conference on Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to voice displeasure with his hand-picked Fed chief’s signal that the central bank was not embarking on a full-blown rate-cutting cycle. 

&gt; “What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China, The European Union and other countries around the world,” Trump tweeted. 

&gt; “As usual, Powell let us down, but at least he is ending quantitative tightening, which shouldn’t have started in the first place,” Trump added in reference to the reduction in the Fed’s vast bond holdings over the past two years. The Fed also called an early halt to that on Wednesday. 

&gt; Powell, for his part, again insisted he and his colleagues do not take politics into account in deciding on rate policy, nor do they conduct policy to demonstrate their independence. 

&gt; “Trump has obviously attempted to influence the Federal Reserve to further his agenda,” said Nick Maroutsos, Co-Head of Global Bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. And as the 2020 presidential race heats up, he is unlikely to stop. “Trump wants lower rates, to keep down the dollar – a lower dollar - and all of that will help his campaign.”

I can't understand if you are sarcastic or real.

1. There are things that Germans do, and there are things that German don't do. And even more importantly there things that we do in the West and there are things we don't do . This argument of yours is really one of the most idiotic things I've heard ""German culture/way of life is not real"".
2. Migrants ( legal or not, since I was talking mainly about legal ones and you made the distinction), should always follow the rules in the country they are in. For example right now I'm in Germany, there are things here that I would do differently in Greece, but I'm doing them in way that I can respect the German mindset and way of living.
3. There is always should be a way to opt out. You don't want pork, great here it is something else. Don't want cow, great, here it is something else. We need to respect the people who come to our countries. But that doesn't mean we need to change the way we do things. If they don't like them, why they came here in the first place?
4. You can always feel like home at your house. It is your sanctuary, your property, they place you live. You can do things there, as far as they are legal of course.

We need respect from both parties. But ""we"" as the welcoming countries we need to be both tolerant and open minded to differences BUT by not changing our mindsets, the day we do things etc.

For example, if Muslims (and I'm using this group because it serves the example) who live in a country inside the EU, DON'T want native women to go around without hearing burka or hijab, we should never accept that. This is idiotic and offensive to freedom of expression IN OUR COUNTRY.

Another example, let's say that a given migrant group lives in one of the countries of the Union, and this group has certain beliefs about the role of woman in society, and they objectify them, attack them etc. this  should not be tolerable in our societies.

You said unless the UK wants to give everyone free trade, there would be need to a hard border. I have shown this to be incorrect. 

3rd time lucky on this question - the '10 to 1' where you say Article 24 cannot be used or that WTO quotas cannot be used (quotas and A24 being the loophole, which I have displayed). 

You make a statement, I say prove it. You don't. 
I make a statement, you say prove it. I do. 

Do you see a difference there? One of us (myself) seems to prefer factual evidence while the other (you) seems to prefer unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence.   

&gt; Nice strawmanning. Now do it for the other 39 trade agreements. See where the math leads you.

You saying I am strawmanning while actually sticking to the topic of trade is a strawman in itself. But alas, that seems to be the Reddit comeback when there is no answer - strawman. Really I don't think many people have actually read what it is, at least I don't think you have as you incorrectly used it.

Some kind of WA - I would agree with you. The current one I would say it doesn't as it's been refused by Parliament, the current Government and disliked by the public. By having a WA that wouldn't necessarily mean the UK has access to previous trade deals, in fact, it shouldn't. The UK would be aiming to forge it's own trade deals not use previous ones.

Europeans and the French particularly take butter very seriously. The feel and taste of a well salted, cultured French butter is wonderful. It has a silky texture, has a much higher fat content, well salted, and tastes almost earthy. As if you can taste what the cattle were feeding on that season the milk was taken. 

Le Beurre Bordier was my favorite and turns out, it’s world renown and highly sought after. You can watch videos on their amazing obsessions with hand making butter. I have been searching and searching since I came home to try and find it here but no luck yet.

Long story short, the wegmans French butter is an imported, French cultured butter and it is definitely one of the best butters I’ve been able to find here that reminds me of the butters I had everywhere in France.

1) Pay a layer for consultation. The 200$ I paid were the BEST decision I did! You can ask heaps of questions, but a good layer might now a MUCH better solution for your specific case. Do this ASAP. It saved my situation.

2) Make sure to comply ALL the conditions of a visa before applying. If you are unsure PAY A LAWYER. If the visa is denied it makes it VERY difficult to apply visas later, don't take this risk.

3) People from Europe and US sometimes don't realize how serious is immigration as they never need visas. I have friends that took lightly and they messed up, had to leave the country and significant others behind. So 6 months will be nothing if you get a 2 year ban.

so we are entering a time period when the united states is simultaneously the only country with the power to keep the world order  intact.....and the least interested in doing so

the result? a transactional arrangement where other nations must PAY America something we want for us to wake up and move heaven and earth. we will be more powerful than ever as the rest of the world strangles under climate change, antibiotics that no longer work, and overpopulation.......all of which will pass America by without impacting us......the American empire is going to be so ubiquitious over the next 50 years we aren't even going to need military bases",True,False,False,,0,1564666383,,False,0,{},evp5822,False,t3_ck5jfc,False,True,t1_evml99i,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ck5jfc/are_republican_claims_of_bias_in_muellers_report/evp5822/,False,,1573409283,-1,True,[],False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,0,

ftfy

&gt; It's your belief that Scotland would both have to join the euro and be unable to join euro. Which makes no more sense than anything else you've said.

Being unable to do something that is necessary is hardly a contradiction? Not sure why you think it is.

&gt; It's your belief that exports to the UK would no doubt lessen after independence, but no one except you has said that and even you haven't given any reasoning.

The reasoning should be obvious. Scotland would be a separate country, and therefore would not be able to export to the UK as freely as it does now. I'm sure you know what a border is etc.

&gt; Those aren't facts or even opinions, they're just your beliefs which are regularly shown to be true by reality.

So, no wonder so many organisations such as Oxfam, Red Cross, UN women (famous for forcefully labeling survivors as ""sex workers"". One survivor begged them to make a correction for 11 months), Amnesty International (previously, reluctant to recognize FGM, war rape as human rights violations and recognized abortion as right in 2007) and others support full decriminalisation of pimping, brothels, sex buying. Vested interest.

After a week, I've decided to replace the Mini for the LTE model - despite living in Europe and having a great amount of data at my disposal, I've spent a few days without any WiFi and it was incredibly troublesome to connect my iPads to my iPhone when needed. It almost always required me to unlock my iPhone and go to the settings for the hotspot connection to make through, and it would disconnect again if the iPad was not used after a few minutes.

About my use cases: I use the iPad Pro for gaming, browsing, Netflix/YouTube, writing, editing photos, taking notes... I also can use it to do some work remotely. It mostly has replaced my MacBook.

Most of the days, when I'm not too lazy, I'll bring my Pro with me at work and use it with a keyboard as a separate device &amp; screen for more personal web searches and listening to music, with the ability to take it with me in a meeting and take notes.

The iPad mini is the one I use in public transports to read, qiockly annote a PDF, listen to music and answer messages without having to bring my iPhone out. I also use it at home to listen to lossless music thanks to its headphone jack and my more high-end headphones.

&amp;#x200B;

I do feel that sometimes, having two iPads feels a bit overkill, especially when I take the two with me at work + my iPhone X.

To balance that out, I'll likely stop bringing my iPad Pro at work with me everyday and just bring the Mini, unless I know I'll have a good use for the Pro (going to a café after work or having meetings...).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I download a lot of music (mostly lossless) on my iPhone and iPad Pro, which respectively hold 256GB and 512GB.

1) It's not just about the revenue when it comes to taxing billionaires. There's a concern amongst many that the country has developed an overly powerful billionaire class who is too influential in politics and society. Heavily taxing this group is intended to combat this. Would it be effective? Unfortunately, I don't have high hopes. Our founding fathers were smart enough back in the day to see how extreme generational wealth corrupted a lot of Europe's history and that's why we've always had a heavy estate tax on the wealthy compared to other nations. Through creative accounting and political influence, generational wealth is a severe problem in our society though these days imo.

2) Income disparity has been growing in the US for several decades. Statistically, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. This is a problem in terms of keeping our economy strong overall and there's a good chance we'll see massive economic repercussions if this trend continues unabated. https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SI.POV.GINI/rankings This is a listing of countries by Gini Coefficient (an indicator of income equality). We're sitting at 59 next to Turkey and Uganda. The countries higher on the list have less income equality, the countries lower on the list have more. Take a look at that list and see if you want your economy and society to be amongst the countries on the top or the bottom.

3) It's not just about taxing literal billionaires - that is indeed a very small number.

No one said anything for a few seconds, then Doctor Strange replied, ""I think bowing is more European and Asian tradition.""

They walked with Drax, Mantis and Quill through the hallways of the Wakandan palace, escorted by a few Dora Milaje. Peter Parker kept looking around, Drax and Quill had their eyes fixed to the floor, Mantis almost seemed to be shivering and Strange was looking straight ahead.

Eventually they arrived at a control room. The front 2 soldiers crossed their arms in front of their chest. One spoke: ""Ubungangamsha bakho. Uneendwendwe.""

T'Challa looked up from the circular table in the centre and stood up, face looking forlorn. Still in his armour, he approached the group.

Peter adopted the gesture the guards had and crossed his arms over his chest. This caught T'Challa's eye.

""I remember you... You were at the airport in Germany.""

Peter dropped the gesture. ""Uh y-yeah... that- that was me. I'm Spider-Man.""

""T'Challa."" He shook Peter's hand.

""You're the kid with the webs that Stark had."" Sam Wilson pushed himself off a wall and stepped closer.

Peter almost flinched at the mention of his name. ""Yeah... Listen, sorry about the webbing and the kicking, no hard feelings?""

""Maybe."" Sam's arms were folded in front of him.

""Right... okay..."" Peter looked around the room. ""And you, I remember you too."" He pointed at Bucky, who was sitting on the floor with his arm detached, staring into the middle distance, . ""B-Bucky, wasn't it?""

The man didn't respond.

""He ain't taking it too well,"" said Sam.

""Who have you brought with you?"" asked T'Challa.

""Actually, I brought them,"" said Doctor Strange. ""My name is Doctor Strange, and these are... Drax, Mantis and... Starlord. They're the Guardians of the Galaxy.""

""I am Groot?"" came a voice from the back.

""Groot!"" Mantis ran out to give the creature a hug, followed by the other Guardians. 

Quill said, ""Groot... Groot, where's Rocket?""

Groot looked up at him. Mantis could sense the answer and started crying again. ""I... am Groot.""

""No... no, NO!"" Drax slammed on the table with force enough to break it was it not made from Vibranium. Nearby guards lowered their spears and he growled at them

""Drax, stop. That's enough,"" said Quill.

""You're one to talk! We had him! We had Thanos and then you lost him because you had a tantrum about Gamorra!"" He shoved Quill away and stomped towards Strange ""And you! Magic Man! You saved the Iron Man in vain and destroyed half the universe. Gamorra, Nebula, Rocket, the Iron Man and half the universe are dead. They suffered the same fate as my family..."" Drax breathed heavily and sat down. ""I don't care if I have to walk across space to him, I will find Thanos and I will kill him painfully.""

""How do we find him?"" asked Wanda. She was sitting in a chair, looking grave.

""That's what I came to talk about."" Stephen stepped forwards. ""I placed a tracking enchantment on the Time Stone before I handed it over. Give me a few hours, the sorcerers of Earth will find him.""

""And then what do we do?"" said T'Challa.

Peter Parker said, ""Then we call the Avengers and...""

""They're gone,"" interrupted Sam.

""... wha-""

""THEY'RE DEAD!"" yelled Bucky. ""Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Thor.... Steve... They're all dust! We're all that's left.""

""No... no they... what are we going to do then?""

""I am Groot."" Groot dropped Stormbreaker on the table with a thud.

Drax walked over. ""Use that? What is that?""

""I am Groot.""

""Thor's Thanos killing weapon,"" said Quill.

Wanda picked up the axe and gripped it, making Drax frown at her. ""Then we use it to finish him."" The blade started to spark with red energy.

""Before that, we all rest and heal,"" said T'Challa. ""While this... wizard contacts his cult.""

We are a democracy, the electorate (and country more generally..) are split on a specific issue, the split is quite narrow (as seen from the referendum, a relatively small majority want the UK to leave the EU, a minority want the UK to remain). Parliament mirrors that split. As a result, it's quite hard for anyone to force anything through as such.

However, Parliament have legislated to take us out of the EU, and we are going through that exit process. It is not, and should not be surprising that given the large amount (albeit minority..) support for remaining, that a concerted effort has been made in Parliament and generally to prevent it (presumably in the hope that there is a significant shift in public opinion).

That is our democracy working, it means that people have a say and see their views reflected by their representatives in Parliament. It doesn't mean we won't leave, it doesn't mean that one side or the other are being ignored, but it does mean that neither side can rapidly or easily simply do whatever they want.

In that context, what 'simple' solution is there for this 'simple' problem? 

And as an aside, the amount of disdain for democracy (when people feel it hasn't delivered for them) and the apparent confusion about what the implications of people having a say in their own futures  means is far more problematic than any international perception.

The job is being done, there isn't an easy way through, mistakes are always going to be made in a complicated political process, they always are. But there is no easy or rapid solution or any way to guarantee that a fractured country, led by a minority government will be able to deliver anything quickly or clearly.

Conspiracy theorists claim both holes are far too small to have been made by a Boeing 757. ""How does a plane 125 ft. wide and 155 ft. long fit into a hole which is only 16 ft. across?"" asks reopen911.org, a Web site ""dedicated to discovering the bottom line truth to what really occurred on September 11, 2001.""The truth is of even less importance to French author Thierry Meyssan, whose baseless assertions are fodder for even mainstream European and Middle Eastern media. In his book The Big Lie, Meyssan concludes that the Pentagon was struck by a satellite-guided missile—part of an elaborate U.S. military coup. ""This attack,"" he writes, ""could only be committed by United States military personnel against other U.S. military personnel.""
FACT: When American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon's exterior wall, Ring E, it created a hole approximately 75 ft. wide, according to the ASCE Pentagon Building Performance Report. The exterior facade collapsed about 20 minutes after impact, but ASCE based its measurements of the original hole on the number of first-floor support columns that were destroyed or damaged. Computer simulations confirmed the findings.
Why wasn't the hole as wide as a 757's 124-ft.-10-in. wingspan? A crashing jet doesn't punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building, says ASCE team member Mete Sozen, a professor of structural engineering at Purdue University. In this case, one wing hit the ground; the other was sheared off by the force of the impact with the Pentagon's load-bearing columns, explains Sozen, who specializes in the behavior of concrete buildings. What was left of the plane flowed into the structure in a state closer to a liquid than a solid mass. ""If you expected the entire wing to cut into the building,"" Sozen tells PM, ""it didn't happen.""
The tidy hole in Ring C was 12 ft. wide—not 16 ft. ASCE concludes it was made by the jet's landing gear, not by the fuselage.
Claim: Conspiracy theorists insist there was no plane wreckage at the Pentagon. ""In reality, a Boeing 757 was never found,"" claims pentagonstrike.co.uk, which asks the question, ""What hit the Pentagon on 9/11?""
FACT: Blast expert Allyn E. Kilsheimer was the first structural engineer to arrive at the Pentagon after the crash and helped coordinate the emergency response. ""It was absolutely a plane, and I'll tell you why,"" says Kilsheimer, CEO of KCE Structural Engineers PC, Washington, D.C. ""I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box.""

There's plenty of land for solar panels that doesn't involve the very expensive business of building stuff on heavily used transport infrastructure. Even building a footbridge over a railway or road is very expensive and requires traffic to be stopped while it's installed. 

For comparison, installing overhead electrification on existing railways can cost $10m+ per km for an operating double-track railway. It involves driving piles and burying cables around existing infrastructure including signalling cables, operating trains, bridges and crossings and points and all the rest. You need to figure out where all the buried cables are, you need to investigate the ground conditions along the whole route, you need to design everything so it can operate safely and won't lead to anything interfering with fast-moving trains then you need to install the whole thing in short gaps overnight and at weekends or shut down a whole section of railway for extended periods with all the disruption that involves. If you wanted to install panels on a railway with existing overhead electrification you'd have the additional challenge of working in very close proximity to 25kV cables and needing to ensure clearances so the whole thing would need to be enormous and engineered to a very high standard. If you did it on a non-electrified line, you'd make it much harder to electrify the line without ripping out the solar panels. 

I can't see overhead solar panels being cheaper than overhead electrification but it would come with the bonus of providing almost zero benefit and huge disbenefits to the railway so it would be impossible to get permission even if you paid for the whole thing. Any kind of maintenance would be vastly more expensive because of the location.

Trying to do the same on a road would face similar challenges but large roads are even wider and have far more vehicles on them, more junctions, sometimes they form the only way of accessing certain places and traffic is not centrally coordinated so in many ways it's even more disruptive to close big sections for long periods of time. Projects like 'smart motorways' which involve installing overhead gantries and communications cables to allow varying speed limits and running on the hard shoulder tend to be even more expensive per km than railway electrification. Installing solar panels over the whole road would again be much more expensive and deliver almost no benefit to the road, with significant disbenefits and very high maintenance costs. Again, it would be impossible to get permission to do this.

&gt; He denounced the opaque legal process that has ensnared him as “the Moscow goat rodeo.”

&gt; Mr. Whelan, 49, a Trump supporter who is a citizen of the United States, Britain, Canada and Ireland, has repeatedly denied being a spy and again declared his innocence in court on Thursday. He had asked to be released from pretrial detention in a grim Moscow prison and placed under house arrest instead; the judge rejected the request.

&gt; “I am asking the leaders and governments in Ottawa, Dublin, London and Washington for their help and public statements of support,” said Mr. Whelan, who works in corporate security, reading from a handwritten statement as consular officials from the United States and Ireland looked on.

&gt; The espionage charges against Mr. Whelan, which he has categorically denied, carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison.

&gt; Mr. Trump and his top officials have stayed mostly silent about Mr. Whelan, a former United States Marine and law enforcement officer who in late December was arrested on a spying charge while at a luxury hotel near the Kremlin while in Moscow to attend a wedding.

&gt; Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, tweeted on Sunday that he had met with Mr. Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth, “on how to support her brother.” Mr. Bolton said that “Russia has provided no evidence of any wrongdoing,” but stopped short of declaring him a victim of wrongful imprisonment.

&gt; “The U.S. has still not said that Paul’s been wrongfully detained, wrongfully imprisoned,” Mr. Whelan’s twin brother, David, said in an email message. “After 6 months and no evidence, is there a reason the U.S., Irish, U.K., and Canadian governments aren’t being more publicly vocal about this lack of evidence, and the legal violations by Russian authorities?”

&gt; Mr. Whelan’s December arrest at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow, made public only several days later, prompted speculation that he had been picked up to be exchanged for one or more Russians held in American jails. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has frequently voiced outrage at the arrest of Russian citizens by the United States and demanded their release.

&gt; In the latest such case, a Russian software developer, Oleg Tishchenko, pleaded guilty on Wednesday in Salt Lake City to smuggling F-16 fighter-jet manuals to Moscow. He denied being a spy and said he merely wanted to develop a realistic flight simulator. The judge sentenced the Russian to one year in prison but ordered his immediate deportation to Moscow because he had already served his time in pretrial detention.

&gt; In his courtroom statement on Thursday, Mr. Whelan indicated that investigators from Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., which is handing the case, were pressuring him to confess, which would relieve them of having to produce evidence in court.

&gt; “My life has been threatened my rights have been denied,” said Mr. Whalen, who appeared to be healthy. “I have been isolated in order to force a confession.”

&gt; Asked about an earlier statement that he was being mistreated, he said that guards at Lefortovo Prison, the tsarist-era jail where he is being held, had become a “little bit nicer” but added: “They are not the problem.” The problem, he said, are the “S.V.R. and F.S.B.,” a reference to Russia’s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies.

&gt; Mr. Whelan’s Russian lawyer, Vladimir A. Zherebenkov, said that his client had been framed and that investigators had produced no evidence to support the accusation of espionage other than a flash drive found in the back pocket of Mr. Whelan’s trousers.

&gt; The lawyer said Mr. Whelan had no knowledge of the flash drive, which he said had been planted by a Russian friend who “works in the system,” apparently a reference to Russia’s security apparatus. He declined to elaborate.

&gt; Mr. Whelan had made numerous trips to Russia over a decade and cultivated dozens of Russian friends through social media. His lawyer said that months before his arrest Mr. Whelan had traveled, along with the person who later set him up, to Sergiev Posad, the site of an Orthodox monastery north of Moscow, and had been waiting for photos and videos of their trip there together.

&gt; A Russian news agency close to the security services reported in January that the flash drive found in Mr. Whelan’s possession contained a full list of names of the employees of a secret Russian security agency. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has described Mr. Whelan as having been “caught red-handed.”

&gt; American officials have been more closed-mouthed about the case, only occasionally denouncing the absence of solid evidence and restrictions on consular access.

&gt; Employed before his arrest as director of global security for an automotive parts manufacturer based in Michigan, Mr. Whelan on Thursday thanked his employer and said cryptically: “The situation is work-related. Please insure maximum cooperation.”

&gt; Court bailiffs hustled reporters out of the courtroom as Mr. Whelan shouted in protest, “This is the sort of treatment I am getting to keep me from speaking to rights advocates and to keep me from speaking to journalists.”

&gt; Complaining that he had been denied full access to consular officials, books and medical care, he said: “This is obviously a politically motivated event.”",True,False,False,,0,1564678799,,1564679685,0,{},evpr8cl,False,t3_ckp2dx,False,False,t1_evpqw24,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/ckp2dx/how_do_you_feel_about_trump_sending_the_us/evpr8cl/,False,,1573419733,6,True,[],False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,r/AskTrumpSupporters,public,0,

Problema é... agrotóxicos orgânicos são mais tóxicos ao seres humanos que agrotóxicos sintéticos. Pois quando se vai sintetizar um agrotóxico, ele é feito de forma tal a ser o mais tóxico possível ao seu alvo (seja peste, ervas, insetos, etc), e menos tóxica ao ser humano.

Agrotóxico orgânico por outro lado, é algo ""natural"" que plantas desenvolvem para combater as pestes, problema é que é abrangente, portanto afeta todas as formas de vida, inclusive humana. E por ser menos eficiente, precisa ser utilizado em maior quantidade.

Scholarship has increasingly overturned this antiquated notion that there was no proper medieval science. In fact, the first 5 pages in the introduction to medieval volume (2) the recent Cambridge History of Science (2013) are devoted simply to a discussion of why it is misleading to think of there being a division between 'medieval' science and 'early modern' science at all.

In particular, while we might wish to say that by the 16th century there was a significant growth in the discussion of physics as an autonomous subject, or something like this, the notion that the Middle Ages was a regression in comparison to antiquity is not taken seriously by modern historians (at least those with any degree of relevant specialism in the period). For example, in the last 20 years or so it has become increasingly clear how much of 'renaissance' science is really indebted to the substantial work on mechanics that was undertaken in the 14th century. 

&gt;In Europe, people have been interested in nature since Augustine mainly as a sign of the divine will and therefore a source of revelation.

I suggest you go read some of the actual scholarship on the subject going back to the late 19th century. More broadly, you will need to square such a statement with the intense interest in Aristotle's works of physics and Plato's Timaeus. This sort of systematic interest in astrology actually coincides more with the growth of interest in cosmology and physics from the 13th century through to early modern period. Aquinas himself spilled a great deal of ink producing extensive commentaries on Aristotle's scientific texts.

&gt;We have only handed down a few works from that time, e.g. by Adelard of Bath, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Witelo and John Peckham.

As a result this list is very idiosyncratic and indeed quite deficient. Most obviously, you miss off two of the most obviously important authors on physics: Jean Buridan and Nicolas Oresme, who both significantly anticipate the works of Copernicus and Galileo. 

But anyways, just to give one representative example, the authors who Grant cites for discussion of the question: 'Whether the earth always rests or is always moved in the middle [or center] of the heavens or world': Michael Scot, Cecco d'Ascoli, John of Jandun, Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Oresme, Themon Judaeus, Johannes de Magistris, Johannes Versor, Thomas Bricot, and John Major (to cut ourselves off rather arbitrarily around the turn of the 16th century).

Some suggestions:

2: There are some suggestions [here](https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/pig-out-its-your-favourite-bacon-butties-in-london-090415), personally I really rate Dishoom's bacon naan, or Le Swine. 

10. As long as you know you're buying entertainment, not actual history. It's pricey for what it is, but fun. How gregarious are you? For actual Henry VIII history head to Hampton Court Palace. 

13. [Try here.](https://www.applausestore.com/calendar) The amount of queuing you'd have to do to be in with a chance of getting a seat though - honestly I'd rather spend my paid-for holiday time doing something other than standing in queue in a street for up to 1.5hrs (without even the guarantee of a seat). 

14. Brings yours with you, plus an adaptor. Abusing the returns policy is a shitty thing to do, and most retailers have a rule that if the item has been opened and used they won't process refunds, precisely because they're wise to these kinds of shenanigans. Why not book in at a [Blow dry bar?](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/best-blowdries-in-london)

18. Have you looked at the [menu](https://www.nandos.co.uk/food/menu)? They do 1/4 chicken legs extra-spicy if that's what you like. Nando's isn't fine dining, it's just a cheap chain restaurant that became a meme - I think it's fairly similar to Applebees or Olive Garden (although I've never been at either). 

19. I've not see a treacle sponge pudding on the menu of any London restaurant recently (it's seen as a very old-fashioned dessert), but [Rules](https://rules.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/JUNE-MENU-front.pdf) is London's oldest restaurant, and they do sticky toffee pudding and golden syrup steam sponge, both of which are very similar. 

22. The Post Office is fine - decent rates and no fuss. [Thomas Exchange](https://www.thomasexchange.co.uk/) has the best rates, but you have to order your currency online in advance for pickup in store to take advantage of those rates. 

23. Cheques are very rare in the UK, most retailers won't even accept them (or at the very least the 19yo processing your purchase will be pretty flummoxed by them, we haven't used cheques for about 15yrs). 

24. You don't need ID for any form of payment in the UK. Your US ID should be fine for booze. 

2. Nothing unique to London - in certain tourist areas you occasionally get 'Tibetan Monks' trying to give you a bracelet and then asking for cash. Just ignore anyone trying to give you anything. And I'm sure you know better than to get involved in street gambling (cup &amp; ball, cards/find the queen etc). 

9. You can pick up a meal deal (prepacked sandwich, snack + bottle of drink) from most supermarkets, or Boots/Superdrug/WH Smith etc for around £3.50/£4.00. Wetherspoons and Sam Smiths pubs are the cheapest, you can pick up a pint for £3.50 in most. That's the cheapest food and drink you'll find on sale in London, if you can't afford that then go the supermarket, but bear in mind you can't carry booze into bars etc (some places may even check your bags). You can get a 3 course meal from the prix-fixe menu in the fancy surroundings at [Brasserie Zedel](http://zedel2.d3r-cdn.com/pdfs/original/4766-zedel-mainmenu-035-aw-web.pdf) for £13.95. Look [here](http://www.londoncheapeats.com/central) or [here](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/cheap-eats-london-food-meals-dinner-under-ten-pounds-a3994566.html) for more cheap eats. 

11. Ask the lovely folks at r/oxford 

12. You'll only be able to use Netflix US. 

13. Try [here](https://www.londonnet.co.uk/films/)

14. Lots of places do a full English breakfast (definitely not just on Sundays). You hotel should probably offer one, or look at the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/londonfood) guide. 

16. Check with your airline carrier, they'll have full details. I've travelled around Europe with carry on luggage that contained power packs and bluetooth speakers, no idea what your TSA rules are though, and US carriers may be different. 

17. I guess - people do snooze on the tube (I've certainly nodded off a few times). The biggest risk is probably missing your stop. Why would you actively want to do this though? 

19. Many cafes/pubs/bars etc will have free wifi, and all underground tube stations offer free wifi (but not in the tunnels when on the train, there's no signal) but just wandering around the streets? Not really. 

20. Pretty much any place that serves food/drink and has a sit down area will have a toilet for customers (although you may have to ask for a key/get a code to unlock the door). Only larger department stores will have toilets. Most tourist attractions will have toilets, and most major train stations (e.g. Liverpool Street, Victoria, Waterloo, Paddington) will have toilets. There are toilet-finder apps in the App store/Play store, try those. 

21. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/2dfit9/londons_most_overrated/) are a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/3gw71p/im_visiting_your_area_of_london_what_thing_should/) threads asking the same question. Personally, I think Madame Tussauds and the London Dungeons are overrated, but scores of teenage kids seem to like them so what do I know. 

22. All the bus tours as basically the same. I've done 'Hop On Hop Off Bus' band tours in several cities and they seem pretty good. 

24. Have you mixed up the Hop On Hop Off Bus brand (the expensive tour buses, around £35-£40, related to question 22 above) with general London buses? Download the Citymapper app, it'll help you navigate London public transport. Also read the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) entry on travel, it'll help you. 

25. Incredibly subjective. I love the V&amp;A because I really like art and design, others prefer the Natural History Museum because dinosaurs are fun, or the British Museum contains amazing artefacts stolen from every corner of the globe. Tate Britain is a brilliant art gallery, as is Tate modern and the National Gallery. What kind of stuff are you into/what things to you prioritise? 

29. Probably cheaper to check another bag - posting heavy/bulky items from UK to US is very expensive if you want it there in a reasonable length of time. 

30. See above re posting bulky items. You can buy a cheap plastic frame for about £15 on Amazon, but I don't see how you'd get it back easily. 

31. Shoreditch is full of bars with trendy young hipsters. Any bars/restaurants that play loud music won't attract an older crowd, so basically aim for anywhere you can hear the music playing from the street and you'll be grand. 

32. The London Transport Museum has lots of great London-themed gifts. The British Museum and the V&amp;A also have excellent gift shops.",True,False,False,,0,1564680875,,False,0,{},evpv9sy,False,t3_cj4mtx,False,True,t1_evp0l45,/r/london/comments/cj4mtx/faqmegathread_for_visitors_and_new_existing/evpv9sy/,False,,1573421655,6,True,[],False,london,t5_2qkog,r/london,public,0,

Yes they definitely have less of interest in military spending as the US but I would be apprehensive in sweeping them all as having little importance globally. I guess it depends what industry you work in whether one needs to take note of the economic/political changes in these countries. Switzerland, Luxembourg and Ireland are just some of the countries that have a larger GDP per capita than the US and many US companies rely heavily on these countries for tax benefits. From a financial/tax perspective- these countries are hugely important and I would argue the general population in the US doesn’t really understand how much so. 

Homogeneous is an interesting point. So the US has a foreign born population of 13.7%. Switzerland is 23.8%, Luxembourg is 44.5% and Ireland was 10% in 2006 but now nearly 1 in 8 are foreign nationals. 

I’m not sure what you mean by “not dealing with diversity well” - can you expand on that? 

Yes a growth in far right movement (including the US) is a huge problem with any progressive policies. However, the political spectrum sits far further right than Western Europe, so it is worth taking that into account.

Of course you can up and leave? Why couldn’t you? Of course, you need to have a skilled job or alternatively go to study. But you 100% can up and leave. 

I find it’s a reoccurring thing with people here to say to themselves that things aren’t good, but convince themselves that things are worse elsewhere - and if that’s not true, these places are not important. It really blocks positive change. 

Instead I think “oh that’s interesting that US has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, yet spends the most per capita on healthcare. What’s going wrong? Which countries do it well and how can we copy them?” or in the case of police brutality “the rate at which US police officers shoot and kill civilians is so high, why is this and where does it not happen? “Eg.

And you’re doing the right thing trying to research and help her get some answers. This can be such a daunting illness and it helps to have someone supportive in your corner so good on you! 

I don’t know it it’ll be of help but I’ve recently been switched to a birth control pill without any estrogen in it. The pill is called Visanne (not sure if that’s just its name in Europe and Australia, but it’s by Bayer so I’d be surprised if you couldn’t find it in the U.S.). It’s a pill that’s been formulated specifically for women with endometriosis. It’s meant to help reduce pain. I didn’t even know this pill existed until I saw an endometriosis specialist who prescribes only this for their patients.

Sadly, my doc before kept me on a pill that lead to a deep spiral of depression and anxiety along with weight gain, and other complications. Looking back, I never should have stayed in her care but I was desperate for help.

So far, I don’t think it’s been enough time on this new pill to fully speak for it, but I feel less cloudy somehow and I’m really hopeful to see improvement in my pain and mood.

Bottom line, research different pills and go with your gut – don’t listen to any doctors that tell your wife she HAS to take one specific type of pill or doesn’t answer your questions.

En septiembre de 2017 una nube ligeramente radiactivo se desplazó a lo largo de gran parte de Europa, aunque su existencia no fue divulgada en la prensa.
Ningún gobierno se responsabilizó entonces de la propagación de material radiactivo, pero un nuevo estudio asegura tener la respuesta sobre el origen del incidente.
Cerca de 70 científicos de distintos países se basaron en más de 1.300 mediciones de diferentes puntos del continente europeo para resolver el misterio.
¿Su conclusión? el origen de la nube no fue un accidente en un reactor, sino en una planta de reprocesamiento de combustible nuclear ubicada en territorio ruso.
Las autoridades en Rusia negaron en diversas ocasiones que una de sus plantas fuera el origen de la nube, y no han hecho pública ninguna reacción oficial tras la publicación del nuevo estudio.
""Los datos indican una liberación desde una instalación de reprocesamiento nuclear en el sur de los Urales, posiblemente el complejo nuclear Mayak"", señala el estudio publicado en la revista de la Academia de Ciencias de Estados Unidos, Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
""Descartamos que se haya tratado de la caída de un satélite o de una liberación en territorio rumano, a pesar de que las concentraciones halladas allí fueron elevadas"", agrega el estudio.

""Detectamos rutenio 106 radioactivo. Las mediciones indican la mayor liberación singular de radioactividad de una planta de reprocesamiento civil"", afirmó Georg Steinhauser.
Los autores aseguran que los niveles de radiación fueron bajos yno representaron un riesgo para la salud de los habitantes de Europa.
Entre los expertos que aportaron mediciones se encuentran Dieter Hainz y Paul Saey, del Instituto de Física SubatómicaTU Wien, de Viena.
Los datos fueron evaluados por el profesor Georg Steinhauser, de la Universidad de Hannover, Alemania, junto con Olivier Masson, del Instituto IRSN de Francia.
""Detectamos rutenio 106 radiactivo. Las mediciones indican la mayor liberación singular de radiactividad de una planta de reprocesamiento civil"", afirmó Steinhauser.
Los valores detectados fueron hasta 100 veces más altos que las concentraciones totales medidas en Europa después del accidente nuclear de Fukushima.
El hecho de que no se midieron otras sustancias radiactivas que no fueran rutenio es una indicación clara de que la fuente debe haber sido una planta de reprocesamiento nuclear, de acuerdo a los investigadores.

El rutenio 106 fue detectado en grandes partes de Europa Central y Oriental, además de Asia, la Península Arábiga e incluyso el Caribe.
La primera alarma fue lanzada por científicos en Italia, que notaron un aumento abrupto en las mediciones de rutenio 106.
El material fue posteriormente detectado en grandes partes de Europa Central y Oriental, y fue registrada incluso en Asia y la Península Arábiga.
Los investigadores afirmaron que se encontró rutenio 106 incluso en el Caribe.
La planta Mayak en Rusia ya había sido escenario de la segunda descarga nuclear más grande de la historia en septiembre de 1957, después de la explosión del reactor nuclear de Chernóbil, en Ucrania, en 1986.
En 1957, un tanque con deshechos líquidos de la producción de plutonio estalló, causando altos niveles de contaminación.

El estudio se basó en más de 1.300 mediciones en diferentes puntos del continente europeo.
El lanzamiento de 2017 se produjo de acuerdo al estudio el 25 de setiembre de 2017 al mediodía, casi exactamente 60 años después del incidente de 1957.
""Esta vez, sin embargo, fue un lanzamiento pulsado que terminó muy rápidamente, a diferencia de los lanzamientos de Chernóbil y Fukushima,que duraron varios días"", afirmó Steinhauser.
""Demostramos que el accidente ocurrió en el reprocesamiento de elementos de combustible gastado, en una etapa muy avanzada, poco antes del final de la cadena de proceso. Y aunque actualmente no hay una declaración oficial, tenemos una muy buena idea de lo que pudo haber ocurrido"", agregó el científico.
El estudio señala que el análisis de la distribución de rutenio ""apoya la hipótesis de que el combustible fue reprocesado unos dos años después de ser usado, posiblemente para la producción de una fuente de Cerio 144 para un experimento con neutrinos en Italia"".

I’ve been looking into transmed/truscum discourse recently (and full disclosure, found this thread through a link on their sub). From what I’ve seen, there’s a variety of perspectives on non-binary within that community, and most people seem to see them as valid. Many are even fine with gender non-conforming people, but they just view them as separate from “trans” based on their medical, transition-oriented definition of trans-ness. 

In terms of two-spirit and other Indigenous identities, I’ve found in my experience of learning in a Canadian context that these are often not entirely in the trans umbrella. I saw a presentation by researcher Aniruddha Dutta who spoke about how generalizing Indigenous systems of gender as “trans” or “transgender” can itself be an act of colonization by imposing and privileging a Western understanding of gender. In Canada, the acronym is often LGBTQ2S+, and the two-spirit people I have met did not identify as trans (although I’m sure some do and that’s ok!).

The trade war with China will grow and not even a new administration will be able to repair anything fast with China, because nobody does an agreement with the US without a ratification by Congress. 

China tries to mitigate this strategy by building the network of BRI and makes first steps to attract academics and investors  by easing the visa laws.

In the case the war is further extending it would be foolish of the EU not to try to use this leverage, to get better trade agreements, like the EU did in the case of Canada, Japan and Mercosur.

Daenerys faz uma ponte entre a cena com Jon na Sala do Trono e a visão em que viu o Trono de Ferro na Casa dos Imortais na segunda temporada.

&gt;*DANY: Mas muitos anos depois, eu o vi. O verdadeiro.*

&gt;*JON: Como?*

&gt;*DANY: Em uma visão. O telhado, a neve, o trono ... (pausa) Tudo parecia exatamente assim.*

**3 - Drogon não mirou no Trono de Ferro**

Segundo o roteiro, Drogon estava querendo destruir qualquer coisa em volta e o trono é acidentalmente atingido.

&gt;*Ele olha para Jon. Nós vemos o fogo se acumulando em sua garganta.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Jon também vê isso. Ele se prepara para morrer.*  
&gt;

The Reagan administration looked at HIV as something that would force them to spend money on, create programs for, and commit resources to the fight. That was unacceptable.

In many ways, the republican party of today is a magnification and extreme form of what it was back then. The republican party of the 1980s was ""we need to help all these poor beleaguered corporations and rich people. They're under attack by those who want to hold responsible for their fair share of the social contract.""

Their attitude that the poor and the sick deserve no consideration because it might mean they would have to forego a little profit really started back then. The support the republican party gets from ""religious"" groups today has its roots in that era. This was the era of the rise of the ""religious right"" into the political arena. The republican party found it profitable to pander to these now-political ""religious"" organizations

The republican party wanted to keep the money from those ""religious"" groups flowing. The republican party wanted to eliminate corporate funding of employee healthcare and force it on individuals. The republican party wanted to dismantle the existing mental health programs. Tackling HIV was contrary to all these goals. 

There was a strong media push to label HIV as something only scum got. Good, pure people didn't get nasty little viruses. If Reagan said ""this disease needs to be fought"" he risked alienating all that sweet ""religious"" funding and voter base. If he said ""there's a health emergency"" he'd risk all the republican plans to dismantle health care programs of the times.

It took European countries to say ""HIV is a *global* problem"" for the Reagan administration to take action. Even then there was still strong pushback from ""religious-based"" groups. 

[C. Everett Koup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Everett_Koop#AIDS) was barred by the Reagan administration from even addressing the issue during Reagan's first term. Can you imagine that? The Surgeon General of the US being told he can't inform the public about a disease. HIV was on the level of ebola as far as ignorance goes back then. 

In many ways history is repeating itself. Except these days we're fighting for affordable healthcare, unfettered internet access, and even our civil rights and against blatant violations of our Constitution. 

There's an opioid crisis that is taking lives like HIV did. Our veterans are dying by their own hands in record numbers.

Yes? Because that’s how the free market works?

The scroll in art is an element of ornament and graphic design featuring spirals and rolling incomplete circle motifs, some of which resemble the edge-on view of a book or document in  scroll form, though many types are plant-scrolls, which loosely represent plant forms such as vines, with leaves or flowers attached.  Scrollwork is a term for some forms of decoration dominated by spiralling scrolls, today used in popular language for two-dimensional decorative flourishes and arabesques of all kinds, especially those with circular or spiralling shapes.

Scroll decoration has been used for the decoration of a vast range of objects, in all Eurasian cultures, and most beyond. A lengthy evolution over the last two millennia has taken forms of plant-based scroll decoration from Greco-Roman architecture to Chinese pottery, and then back across Eurasia to Europe.

I really want to know if the current proposals outright ban supplemental insurance, but just generally such wouldn't be needed if everyone is on publicly available insurance. It would probably die on its own. Is the outcome of this really bad in the UK, Canada, France and every other developed nation? 

\&gt; Would it be okay to say refugee problem?

It depends. I think a lot of people aren't looking at the root causes of people fleeing their countries (hint, the root causes are often world superpowers disrupting countries with war profiteering, CIA intervention, a long history of colonialism/imperialism) that the superpowers aren't taking responsibility for. If we make a problem, shouldn't we be part of fixing it? 

Additionally, it really depends how much awareness you're bringing to the table about refugees, and how much race is being conflated into this. Most Americans today are ok with the idea that we let in many (perhaps not enough) Jewish people in the 1930-1940s to escape religious persecution, but most people see them as ""white"" and thus ""the same"". Most Americans are also ok with the idea that many of initial European settlers of the US were religious refugees. And that pretty much all the Europeans who came here were essentially fleeing their own countries to make a better life for themselves instead of ""fixing their own countries"". But, we view all of them as ""white"" and thus ""ok"". Now that it's more brown people who are refugees (and many Muslims, again, pay attention to the history of those countries and how superpowers have messed with those countries for oil)... well, suddenly it's not-ok. 

Also, do keep in mind there's a huge history of ""\[religion\] problem"" that's often culminated in thousands, if not millions of people dying. Words have meaning. If you have a ""final solution"" to the problem in mind, then we have a problem. 

If you're keeping all of this in mind, and have compassionate solutions in mind, then I suppose it's ok to think of as a ""refugee problem""; although the wording could be more compassionately phrased as a humanitarian crisis that's been caused by the hands of the powerful and wealthy, and hurting the poor and often powerless.

[],,NaturaSiveDeus,1523586270.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3a6bvdn,False,[],"&gt;What is the difference between Yiddish, Hebrew, and Jewish?

Technically, Yiddish means ""Jewish,"" but it refers not to Jews as a people, but to the language of the Ashkenazim, the Jews who migrated to Germany and Eastern Europe. It is essentially a dilaect of High German, with elements of Hebrew and Aramic sprinkled in and written using the Hebrew alphabet.

Hebrew was a designation for the people who would become the Israelites and Jews, amd also a synonym for these people themselves. It is also the ancestral language of the Jewish people; it ceased to be the spoken language following the second century, but remained the holy tongue of prayer and the Torah for millennia afterwards. The language was revived a century ago as Modern Hebrew, and is now spoken by millions of Jews as their native language.

&gt;Does any aspect of Judaism count as an ethnicity? I assume Judaism is the religious belief whereas Jewish is the ethnicity, and I want to make sure if that's correct or not.

Judaism is the ancestral, binding faith of the Jewish Nation. One who converts to Judaism is doing more than joining a religion, they are becoming members of the Jewish people as a whole. Our halacha (traditional law) prohibits reminding a ger--a convert--that they used to not be a Jew. Jewishness in this regard connotates notions of both ethnicity and tribal or national membership. If this sounds confusing, imagine it like this--some people are ethnically British and have lived in Britian for a thousand years, and some people are immigrants that only recently gained British citizenship, but in the eyes of the law, both are equally British. 

&gt;Is 'Jew' a slur?

No, though it can be used as a slur. Although I do not speak for all Jews in this regard, I myself take no offense to being called a Jew--it's what I am, after all. 

&gt;What is the purpose of a kippah? 

To remind us of our duties and submission to the Divine. A majority of our halachic authorities have ruled that it is wrong to go with an uncovered head, and over the years it simply became tradition.

No?  Funny that.  

All those ones are strangely missing.  

Manipulation works both ways doesn't it! 

 Let's compile a list of all the silly season stories from the dregs of the press that are read by dwindling numbers and are preaching to the converted anyway.  Which isn't actually they many, given we are talking about 30 fucking years.  

And then feed it to hungry remainers so they can laugh at the thick people.  Yes, someone is being manipulated and you can't even see it.

Is this list all it took to sway people?  Goes to show what an absolutely terrible argument for remaining there must be. 

This is what best your arguments?  How embarrassing for you.

 And let's be honest most remainers voted to stay as it was the default.  None of you ""love "" the EU.  None of you even knew what it did or didn't do until it was too late.  ""Oh shit"" we should have taken that more seriously.

Or perhaps you agree with every single thing the EU has ever done?  It's all great is it?  Lucky you.  Lucky that your politics matches perfectly.  A more honest remainer will admit that there are some faults.  Spend some time on other EU subs, you'll see there is actual honest debate.  

The moment you accept there are pros and cons...  You must accept there are valid reasons to want out.

We'll see.

Being fair and rational, you'll all jump at the chance at circulating my list of project fear stories that never materialised.

Good luck with your stockpiling guys.  Project reality innit, better stock up. No more holidays, collapse of the NHS, empty  shelves, no jobs, the cliff edge.  House price crash would be awesome though.

A drop in GDP is fine by me.  I'm with extinction rebellion on that one.  Why are you guys champions of infinite growth and solving our problems with unsustainable immigration.  How unfashionable!  Is that because it's all you've really got?  The arguments for the EU always seem so weak.  The moment the UK doesn't crumble to dust...  You've actually got nothing.

Ostsiedlung (German pronunciation: [ˈɔstˌziːdlʊŋ], literally east settling), in English called the German eastward expansion, was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of Germanic-speaking peoples from the Holy Roman Empire, especially its southern and western portions, into less-populated regions of Central Europe, parts of west Eastern Europe, and the Baltics. The affected area roughly stretched from Estonia in the north all the way to Slovenia in the south and extended into Transylvania, modern-day Romania in the east. In part, Ostsiedlung followed the territorial expansion of the Empire and the Teutonic Order.

According to Jedlicki (1950), in many cases the term ""German colonization"" does not refer to an actual migration of Germans, but rather to the internal migration of native populations (Poles, Hungarians, etc.) from the countryside to the cities, which then adopted laws modeled on those of the German towns of Magdeburg and Lübeck.

We have 320,000 American Characters
147,00 European characters
280,00 Japanese

This sub has roughly 300,000 subs and about 10,000 people on concurrently. I believe we peaked somewhere either around 22k - 26k on ShB Release but I’m not sure. But for the sake of argument let’s add them to the peak concurrent players to ever play this game simultaneously. 40k steam players, 26k players from Reddit who swore off steam puts us at 66k.

It’s incredibly unlikely but let’s just say all 66k players on that one day were from America which makes up roughly 30% of the entire FFXIV population. In that additional 70% we’d end up roughly around 200k players that’s awesome. 

But that’s our roughly peak for the next 2 years and also impossible due to time zones.  Runescape is peaking 90k on a Wednesday. Just some fucking random day. 

Okay what are peaking out now after a month. Well we’re looking at 30k steam players, 10k reddit users (which yeah I know isn’t 100% accurate but we literally don’t have the numbers otherwise) some logic if that’s 30% of the global pop our peak is 120 - 130k that’s super dope. But like I said also super duper impossible. 

Like if we have 700k active players worldwide in the past year over 70, we likely have near 300k+ under 70, also much harder to tell due to the whole free under 35 thing. But it’s fairly rational to assume we have about 1.3 million players in FFXIV. It’s a fair bit unlikely that we still have 1/10th of our global population all playing together at the same time on a Wednesday a month after the expac released. 

But hey that’s just my rough math you can disagree with me. old school runescape still has a fuck load of players on a wednesday and should be respected as a juggernaut on our scene. I don’t even fucking play the game.

In that thread I referenced a podcast by Dad-Starting-Over where he made a comment that if your sex life does not at least somewhat resemble what you see in mainstream man-woman XXX vids, that there is something wrong.

He goes on to explain that for the most part, main stream porn is two fit, attractive, uninhibited, sex-positive people getting it on with each other.

Yes, they are paid actors following something of a script and yes there is going to be cinematic embellishment with the moans and groans and dirty talk for the camera.

But for the most part it is healthy, attractive and sexually uninhibited people doing what fit healthy people who are attracted to each other do.

The feminists and the church ladies and the anti-porn crusaders would have us believe that all porn models are kidnapped and exploited human trafficking victims, but in the free western world I have the feeling the truth is it is hot, horny people making a quick a few quick and easy buck$ doing what they do best. 

In other words we’ve been raised to believe that all porn is fake and exploitive and all porn actresses are exploited victims.  

There may be some truth to that in stuff coming from Mayasia and Eastern Europe and old Soviet Bloc nations but I think most American, adult entertainment is consensual, horny people doing what they dig.

No, I listed two examples of where Christianity promoted and created widespread systems of slavery. These systems encompass more than 1500 years of Christian history.

&gt;But what you have not done is shown how Christianity had more slavery than its neighbors and how this was the norm of all of Christian history.

But I'm not making that claim, I'm arguing against the claim that Christian civilization is the smallest offender in terms of slavery, other than zoroastrianism. Given that Christian societies in Europe were founded on slavery (serfdom), then the claim is clearly false. Christian societies engaged in systemic slavery. Given that the NA slave trade and the EA slave trade were competitors for brutality, scale, and human suffering, that makes Christian civilization one of the worst offenders in human history.

&gt;Christianity was founded in 30 AD but the Middle Ages started sometime like 500 AD.

&gt;Also serfdom is not chattel slavery 

False, educate yourself on what chattel slavery actually is. It's merely defined as a system of slavery where people are treated as personal property. Serfdom meets that qualification because a serf could be bought, sold and traded by his Lord and was considered his Lord's property, ergo serfdom is a form of chattel slavery.

Chattel slavery is a general term. Serfdom references a specific system of slavery. They aren't different, one encompasses the other. Slavery doesn't need to be as brutal as British/US slavery to be called ""chattel slavery"", it merely needs to meet a basic set of criteria. Namely, people being bought and sold as commodities. This was possible under the many forms of Serfdom.

&gt;Serfdom was bad but it was a movement away from chattel slavery and one specific to Christianity.

Also false, Asian cultures had systems of serfdom in the same time period, including Korea, Japan, China.

Basically if someone died from a violence it was tradition to brick in the window in the room where the actual death happened, or the window nearest to the physical spot the death occurred if there was more than one window in the room. In parts of Ireland it was tradition to brick in the *highest* window nearest to the site of the death...

Depending on who you asked it was to EITHER prevent the vengeful spirit of the victim from finding the room again and causing problems for other innocent people who would eventually reside there (space often being at a premium and a need for a place to live often overcame fear of death) OR it was to prevent the spirit of the victim from leaving the room to seek vengeance on its murderer (and possibly anyone who happened to be near them at the time). 

So windows were bricked over to either keep ghosts out or to keep them in, the common thought being that the spirit would leave/ come back by the closest opening to the outside world such as the window. If you physically and permanently 'erased' the window the spirit would be confused, unable to find the location of so much pain and distress again or unable to leave the location of pain and distress to get revenge.

Same principle under which mirrors were covered during the mourning period. Not because people didn't want to see themselves looking awful and ragged, but because mirrors (and windows) represent a thin barrier between 'another place' and were often thought to be used by spirits and fae as doorways into our world. 

If you look at older manor houses, castles, etc., you can often find a bricked in window somewhere on it. Around the 1950's it was thought to be embarrassing to have such a visual reminder of 'stupid old nonsense beliefs' so a lot of the used-to-be windows were either opened up and framed out again, or more likely the facade was built up over the indented window space to look like unbroken wall, being the cheaper and easier option.",True,False,False,,0,1564701208,,1564785270,0,{},evr3nz1,False,t3_ckpc8n,False,True,t3_ckpc8n,/r/CrappyDesign/comments/ckpc8n/think_your_missing_a_window_there_bud/evr3nz1/,False,,1573442803,1,True,[],False,CrappyDesign,t5_2sa3m,r/CrappyDesign,public,0,

The countries the UK will most likely sign a free trade agreement with is Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This agreement will happen. No questions about it. The problem what will the terms be of this agreement. 

Canada, Australia and New Zealand already have a free trade relationship with each other CPTPP. That deal alone is worth 13.5 trillion dollars or 13.4 percent of the global economy. So basically this deal is just to add the UK into the mix. 

Canada has three trade deal with the US (USMCA, NAFTA and CUSFTA) which accounts 74 percent of all Canadian trade.  USMCA gives the US and Mexico a veto over any Canadian trade deal. Canada also has a deal with its second largest trading partner, the EU (CETA). This represents 10 percent of all Canadian trade.  

Canada will not risk these agreement for a trade deal with the UK which represents only 2.5 percent of all Canadian trade. So whatever trade terms the UK gains will be less favourable.

What about Australia and New Zealand. Britain represents 
3.4 percent of all trades with Australia and New Zealand. The vast majority of their trade is with China and CPTPP states. Again they will not jeopardize their trade with those states for a mere 3.4 percent. So whatever deal is signed with be less favourable than CPTPP. 

Actually had the UK stayed in Europe, it could have used it's leverage to get a free trade deal between Australia and New Zealand. The UK could have been the base for all trade between these countries and Europe thanks to their common language and historic connections.

Taking an example from your comment: you said it was a beautiful experience. While ""beautiful"" is gender-neutral, in Portuguese ""lindo""/""linda"" has to agree in gender with the noun. ""experiência"" is a female noun, so ""Isso foi uma linda experiência"" would be more adequate. This kind of mistake is pretty common from non-native speakers and kinda solves itself with practice, so you shouldn't worry too much with that.

""increvil"" (""incrível"") and ""experenxia"" (""experiência"") are harder to tackle. Usage of diacritics is pretty hard to learn and Brazilian Portuguese differs a bit from European Portuguese in this point. They don't follow easy rules. Unless you're interested enough to grab a textbook, just copycat the spellchecker.

IMO the best way to improve your vocabulary is casually consuming media in Portuguese.

1. 1.a person who strongly identifies with their own nation and vigorously supports its interests, **especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.**

Nationalists believe that their nation and their national culture/its people are superior to others. The Nazis, for example, believed that pure Germans were the superior race and pursued a campaign across much of Europe to promote their culture and their beliefs and force it on other nations (as of course you and everyone else knows). It's different from just being proud of your country or even simply being an isolationist.

These include free speech and the ability to own guns for defense of yourself, your neighbor and your country.

They're cheap because 99% of guns are semiautomatic. It's just what a ""gun"" is in the modern world. One trigger pull = one bullet is fired.

You have to realize a America a very young country which shares a very frontier style culture. We were founded by essentially ISIS in the sense that it was a minor religious group who one day said ""nah fuck this shit, this country us ours now"" and defeated the major world power in order to secure it.

As such the concept of an armed citizenry is very, very deeply embedded within all of American culture and the right to be armed is codified in the absolute highest law of the land that even congress, the president or the courts cannot touch. The only way to amend this law would be if basically 75% of the states all agreed to change it, something which will potentially never happen but will certainly not happen in my lifetime.

Support for the right to self defense, which is viewed as an inherent human right in America and codified into law as such, is something that is fervently popular and has no sign of declining anytime in the foreseeable future.


You ask yourself ""But in countries where guns are banned, people are not shot"". A valid claim. However the mindset here is that sure we could all be infinitely safer with speech censored, books burned, alcohol prohibited, every phone call monitored etc, potentially millions of lives would be saved in such a system, but again that frontier mentality persists and therefore Americans have almost uniformly elected for dangerous freedom VS peaceful slavery. Whether that's the right choice or not is yet to be seen but ultimately in a country where shootings are at record lows as well as crime in general, there's simply no realistic movement to remove the right to be armed currently.

I, and in fact we, all understand how foreign this concept must seem to our brothers and sisters abroad across Europe etc as it's absolutely true no guns means no more shootings, but to be quite frank, our entire country as an entity was founded upon the singular concept of ""kill the Europeans if they ever come here, use the shovels and farm tools if you have to, we fight to the last man"". As a result of this cultural legacy people to this day value the concept of owning guns to kill intruders over frankly everything else because everyone who didn't believe this was removed from the gene pool here long ago.


Kinda barbaric, but it also just is what it is. Arguments like ""people don't become shot in the face in places where there are no guns"" simply will never prevail here because the country was founded on the principle of shoot everyone else in the face ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",True,False,False,,0,1564718251,,1564728786,0,{},evrtr6x,False,t3_ckrsnt,False,False,t1_evqqq4s,/r/worldnews/comments/ckrsnt/trump_us_will_hit_300_billion_worth_of_chinese/evrtr6x/,False,,1573455226,5,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

It is literally the first thing that comes to my mind. This is because the Western interpretation of  ""human rights"", ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" are conditioned on the elimination of the Indigenous people and the subsequent mass distortion and denial of this history. I cannot even think about the concept of human rights without thinking about its contradictions and hypocrisies.

And what fundamentally pisses me off about all these sycophants of Western-styled democracy, may they come in the forms of political pundits across the political spectrum, or some misguided HK protesters, is that they willingly ignore this reality.

&gt;The prospect of Americans soon being able to legally access Canadian pharmacies in order to obtain dramatically cheaper drugs is **drawing criticism from health-care advocates who warn of the spectre of drug shortages north of the border.**

&gt;""This definitely raises the risk,"" said **Kim Hanson, executive director of federal affairs for Diabetes Canada**, told The Current's guest host Laura Lynch.

&gt;The **U.S. has the world's highest drug prices**. Faced with voter anger over the steep and rising costs of drugs, President Donald Trump's administration announced Wednesday **it will set up a system to allow Americans to legally import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada**. 

&gt;The policy change, if passed, **would reverse previous decisions by past administrations and weaken a longstanding ban that had stood as a top priority for the politically powerful pharmaceutical industry**. So far, Washington lawmakers have offered no estimate for when this new legislation might take effect.

|

****

&gt;Trying to head off the U.S. government's upcoming move, **more than a dozen organizations signed a letter urging the Canadian government to safeguard the country's drug supply**.

&gt;**Diabetes Canada** was one of the signatories to that letter, and following Wednesday's announcement Hanson says her organization is now looking to Ottawa ""to take decisive and proactive action.""

&gt;""It's clear to us that whatever measures need to be put in place to prevent, for example, large-scale importation by online pharmacies or large-scale importation by large U.S. states, has to be put in place because **Canada is not structured to produce an amount of medications required for a population that size**,"" she told Lynch.

|

****

&gt;With major **American and Canadian drugmakers united in their condemnation** of Washington's proposal, Picard contends ""there's a thousand practical reasons why this won't happen.""

&gt;""A lot of these laws, I think, will be struck down in the U.S. **There will be opposition from the pharma companies there,""** he said.

&gt;""[And] there's no reason that pharma companies in Canada, **which tend to be subsidiaries of larger American and European firms, to ship to the U.S**.""

|

****

&gt;The largest U.S. **pharmaceutical and biotech companies** ... **opposed the idea of importation through their lobbyists PhRMA and BIO**, claiming it could have harmful consequences.

&gt;""There is **no way to guarantee the safety of drugs that come into the country**,"" PhRMA chief executive Stephen Ubl said.

|

****

&gt;Insulin has been a flashpoint in the U.S. battle over exorbitant prescription drug prices.

&gt;The cost of the life-saving medication can be as much as **10 times more per vial in the U.S. ...than in Canada.**

&gt;North of the border, a federal regulator, the **Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, is responsible for setting ceiling costs for brand-name drugs**.

&gt;As a result, **more Americans are making the cross-border trek as an alternative to paying thousands of dollars for insulin**. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently permits cross-border dispensing of up to **a three-month supply of the drug, provided it's for personal use.**

&gt;Picard believes importing drugs from Canada will create a litany of other problems in the process.

&gt;""We have drug shortages now for a variety of complex global reasons, and this would probably be exacerbated if it happened,"" said Picard.

&gt;In recent years, **Canadian drug makers have reported thousands of shortages — often because of manufacturing issues but also due to increased demand**.

&gt;According to Picard, **the pressure of these companies needing to supply 10 to 15 times the amount they're currently producing ""is just not possible.""**

&gt;""The ultimate solution to this if the U.S. wants lower drug prices, [is] **they have to introduce price controls like every other Western country has done.""**

&gt;Hanson admits she has ""tremendous empathy"" for what Americans face, but believes that **should not come at the expense of Canadians with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.**

&gt;""We also have to ensure **that none of these caravans — or more worryingly, large-scale importation of drugs from Canada — disrupts the supply of this life-giving medication**,"" she told The Current.",True,False,False,,0,1564721232,,False,0,{},evrx0uz,False,t3_ckyvh3,False,False,t3_ckyvh3,/r/canada/comments/ckyvh3/canada_has_no_reason_to_support_us_plan_to_import/evrx0uz/,False,,1573456754,16,True,[],False,canada,t5_2qh68,r/canada,public,0,
