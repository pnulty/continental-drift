If people don't *see* an incentive, which is what i said, then there is no reason for them to work.

&gt;How much do people in California receive from the ""nanny state"" and what impact does this have on housing costs? 

Probably above my pay grade. As far as I know (living in CA for 9 yrs), the rent prices are just absurdly high out here, and that is one of the reasons *why* CA spends so much on welfare. That is my understanding of the relationship between housing costs and welfare spending in CA.

&gt;How does welfare increase income inequality?

You could Google it. An excerpt from a 2015 European Central Bank report:

&gt;multilevel cross-country regressions show that the degree of welfare state spending across countries is
negatively correlated with household net wealth. These findings suggest that social services provided by the state are substitutes for private wealth accumulation and partly explain observed differences in levels of household net wealth across European countries. In particular,
the effect of substitution relative to net wealth decreases with growing wealth levels. This implies that an increase in welfare state spending goes along with an increase - rather than a decrease - of observed wealth inequality.",True,False,0,1525133656,,False,0,dy8pdsv,False,t3_8g00nd,False,t1_dy8mzll,/r/conspiracy/comments/8g00nd/la_has_criminalized_poverty_by_making_it_illegal/dy8pdsv/,,1526930036,20,False,True,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,public

False,NaCLedPeanuts,,,,"Other New Zealanders have responded with some of the more typical stuff so I'll respond with things much closer to the OP's examples.

First up is the *moehau*, which is purported to be either a large, humanoid creature or a race of people living in the forests primarily in the Coromandel Range in the North Island. It could be related to or be a descendant of the *maero*, another humanoid creature said to have inhabited New Zealand before the arrival of Maori. Sizes range up to about seven feet tall. Outside of the Coromandel Range, reports have come mainly from the West Coast region of the South Island, where a tall hairy humanoid has been observed stealing vegetables from people's gardens or scaring campers out by throwing rocks and screaming at them. 

Moa have become ""cryptids"" in the sense that people have claimed to see them despite the birds going extinct at least two hundred years before the first known Europeans arrived. Moa are most famous for being massive birds, but there were numerous species where birds were about a fifth of the size of the largest species, and some lived in areas where humans generally did not go. Moa have mostly been reported from the Southern Alps in the South Island, where some of the largest tracts of pre\-European forest remain untouched. Stories range from a fisherman seeing multiple birds crossing slip faces in Fiordland to a train driver almost running over what he thought were sheep, but turned out to be large, flightless birds. 

Another one that not many people in New Zealand know about is the *waitoreke*, a mammal said to be about the size of a cat which has been attributed to animal sightings and footprints that resemble that of an otter, as well as the discovery of dams similar in construction to those made by beavers. The first documented sighting was made from Captain James Cook's ship the *Endeavour* in Dusky Sound in Fiordland. German geologist Julius von Haast, who explored the South Island in the middle of the 19th century, claimed to have found footprints of the *waitoreke* as well as a pelt of one, with similar coloring to the eastern quoll, a small mammal found in Australia. If it does exist, it would be significant discovery as New Zealand was devoid of land\-dwelling mammals for millennia, save for some species of bats and pinnipeds along the coast. 

New Zealand's Area 51, or some sort of secretive facility, is the Waihopai Station located on the northeast of the South Island near the town of Blenheim in the Marlborough region. Construction began in 1987 and it became operational in 1989. Not much about it is known, but it's not particularly well hidden, as a bunch of opponents to it cut through the fence surrounding the station and sliced open the radomes with a sickle. There is also another facility called  Tangimoana Station which is located 30 kilometres west of Palmerston North in the North Island. It's nowhere near as well known as Waihopai.

False,[deleted],,,,"  At various points in history, we did have multiple species of humans.  They just got out-competed and went extinct.  The most recent episode took place around 25,000 years ago.  

Neanderthal man was a human species which occupied Europe.  Cro-magnon man (aka anatomically modern humans) occupied Africa.  As long as both species lived on separate continents, there was no problem.  It was easy for each species to breed in isolation and adapt to living in different environments.  Eventually, however, Cro-magnon humans spread out of Africa and displaced the Neanderthal.

We don’t really know why this happened.  Climate change might have made the environment more favorable to Cro-magnon and less favorable to Neanderthal.  Cro-magnon was probably also smarter and more adaptable than Neanderthal, so they were better able to compete and use technology to their advantage.  Some have suggested that Cro-magnon may have brought African diseases that Neanderthal was vulnerable to.  There is at least one anthropologist who thinks Cro-magnon had an advantage in hunting efficiency because he domesticated wolves while Neanderthal did not.  It could have been any - or all - of these things.  

The jury is still out on whether Cro-magnon ever interbred with Neanderthal.  Some people think evidence supports the idea.  However, even if they did interbreed it was not widespread.  The hybrid species may even have been sterile, like mules, and in any event their genetic line did not survive even in hybridized form.

Yeah, I suppose there isn’t very much *only* he could do, but I imagine he would lead congress by a very conservative example. One thing he could directly touch is nominating Federal and Supreme Court Justices that would overturn decisions related to civil liberties of the LGBT community and reproductive rights.  I’m not sure how you feel about immigration or the transgender rights, but I imagine a unified Pence administration would probably be considerably more successful than Trump attempts at the travel ban and the trans armed forces ban.

I think more importantly than any of that (and this refers to your second question as well) is the rhetoric. Under normal circumstances, regardless of politics, the voice of the President is an important one. If a sitting president openly considers 10-15% Godless perverts, I think that could significantly harm our voice on a global scale and the values we hold as a country.  His ability to demonize an entire category of people is dangerous weapon that i would hate for the leader of the free world to hold. 

&gt; Who exactly in the Democratic party offers a centrist economic policy?

That really depends what you mean. I would consider free trade to be classically liberal position held by modern conservatives, while Trump’s protectionist views seem to be more closely aligned with the Bernies of our current political environment. Regarding domestic policy, I imagine that someone like Biden or Cory Booker might toe the line more than Bernie or Elizabeth Warren would.

I mean, Perfume did tour within Asia a few years back (I remembered it was somewhere in Singapore and Taiwan, pardon me if I'm wrong as I haven't been following their past world tours). Do they not want to be internationally popular? They already are a household name as the top techno pop girl group in Japan, so I'm not sure why they shouldn't take the next step further?

The only reasons I can think of are probably due to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the focus on the US market. My guess is that even if they do have a World Tour, it'll probably be all in the US (Just looking at Babymetal's ""World Tour"" would be an indication of how Amuse would handle this). I understand that the US is the largest market right behind Japan, but what about Europe? Australia? Or even their home turf, Asia?

Re: Germany - It depends on whether their current economic boom continues, and, in the case of a downturn, how the different political parties position themselves.

 Merkel ran on Germany's strong economy and (historically unmatched) financial security in the October 2017 elections. However, since that's taken for granted, the election became a referendum on cultural and ideological issues. As many SPD as CDU/CSU voters defected to the AfD over migration and *Leitkultur*; as many or more CDU/CSU voters defected to the FDP since Merkel wasn't fiscally conservative enough (Eurozone bailouts, etc.). Most voters didn't seem to want anything tangible out of the election, insofar as impact on their everyday lives was concerned. Like, AfD voters basically want to kick out Muslims and introduce *Leitkultur*, but no one can agree on what that even means, and most of them don't live in areas that have migrants in substantial numbers.  Voters who want stricter fiscal conservatism (a.k.a. being harder on Greece and welfare recipients) morally object to their dollars going unseen to the lazy. Both groups believe they are victims - of refugees, the EU, etc. Since it was an election about culture and ideology (and vague notions of national victimhood), the SPD's proposals for eliminating kindergarten fees and making the health care system more equitable fell on deaf ears. So, it was sort of like the US 2000 and 2016 elections in that regard.

I'm not so worried about the AfD becoming a governing party in the near future. In part, that's because the AfD is deeply divided between those who want to govern someday (who are splitting off), and those who are only interested in being a disruptive force in the Bundestag. In part, that's because Merkel (and new interior minister Seehofer) are implementing more restrictive and/or punitive migration (and deportation) policies. The big question is who succeeds Merkel as leader of the CDU, and whether it will be someone (like Jens Spahn) who's a cultural hardliner and wants to woo AfD voters (possibly in vain.) A failed push in that direction, abandoning the center ground, is one of the few scenarios in which an SPD chancellor is possible - if they're smart enough to try to reclaim the center. Merkel made Spahn health minister in order to destroy his political career, since anyone trying to reform the health system will become unpopular. She made the more moderate, pro-European, culturally moderate Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer General Secretary of the CDU, a less politically hazardous position that would position her to become the next *Kanzlerkandidatin*.

Language death in the modern era is often a symptom of colonization or the imposition of a dominant or 'metropolitan' culture on an indigenous culture, and of the latter's needs being ignored or unaddressed. In many cases, reducing the number of languages spoken worldwide doesn't remedy this pathology, and in fact can inhibit or restrict access to cultural wealth.

I live in the state of New Mexico and have done so for most of my life—I grew up in Farmington near the Navajo Nation, and now I go to university in Albuquerque, which before European contact was inhabited by communities that spoke the Navajo, Apache, Keres and Tanoan-Kiowa and Keresan languages. Many of the reservations in New Mexico have third-world living conditions such as no running water, no electricity and uranium mining contamination, and the cultures are struggling to survive in an environment that emphasizes fluency in English and (occasionally) Spanish. One of my colleagues feels like he doesn't belong in his own heritage because he's been denied opportunities to learn Keres like his ancestors did. My partner knows exactly why his father never taught him Spanish and his mother never taught him Navajo—becaise if he spoke a language other than English it would hurt his chances of success in the long run.",True,False,0,1525151089,,False,0,dy9516a,False,t3_8fzu1l,True,t1_dy87cpf,/r/linguistics/comments/8fzu1l/what_have_been_some_of_the_worst_linguistic/dy9516a/,,1526938966,3,False,True,False,linguistics,t5_2qhos,public

False,kristynaZ,CZEC,,Czech Republic,"&gt; You equal law infridgements with rejecting the principles of the EU. This is not the same.

It's exactly the same. The refugee quotas are a binding EU directive, not a core EU value. You cannot trigger Article 7 over the refugee quotas. The refugee quotas aren't any different from the legal perspective than any other directive that Germany is breaking. The fact that you selectively pick exactly this issue to rant about EE speaks about your own bias.

We are not going against the EU 'whenever we can'. We are having a disagreement about one directive. Quotas aren't even the only way to support SE. You can reject quotas and still support SE in other ways.

&gt; What is ""everything we had to give""? The things you had to give have mainly to do with capitalism, not with the EU. Don't mix those things up.

Oh, so I can't mix any econonomic or demographic side-results of the EU membership in this, but you keep saying how it's acceptable to mix structural funds with immigration. So some things can be mixed but others can't?

&gt; Just the EE countries work against it wherever they can and this cannot be unpunished.

What are we doing speficially that is against the EU? What is my country, or Slovakia or the Baltics or Slovenia doing against the EU? Why should we all be targeted?

&gt; The budget means that Germany will have to give money. 

Everyone will have to give more money to fill the gap of Brexit, otherwise there will be a smaller budget - that's quite obvious and we are perfectly aware of that.

&gt; nd EE countries are not exactly in a position to demand anything in those negotiations, because if Germany refuses to give money, there is no budget. If we have no budget, EE countries will get no funding at all.

If there is no budget, then EE countries also don't have to pay in anything. My country has gotten richer and so it wouldn't qualify for nearly as much funding as before even if the GDP PPP was still the only criterion. If other criteria are considered like the unemployment (we have the lowest in the EU) or number of refugees (we have a very few of those) then we would likely receive very little money anyway. Thus you can't really threaten us with 'you won't get any funding if the budget isn't approved' when the proposed budget already cuts our money anyway.

False,redditor_85,,,,"Hm...then are you suggesting the US becomes a welfare state like some European countries where the government gives handouts to people out of jobs?

Edit: I'll add some more here since you edited your response. I understand your perspective where you believe that an immigrant takes away a job or handout that could go to a citizen. Conceptually, it makes sense, but could you explain what the immigrant exactly takes away? I don't think I understand that because the National Academy of Sciences issued a report on immigration in 2016 that stated the willingness of less-skilled immigrants to work at low pay reduced consumption costs — the costs to consumers of goods and services like health care, child care, food preparation, house cleaning, repair and construction — for millions of Americans. I know, it doesn't make sense, right? But that's what their study found.

That's not saying that immigration has all positive effects on Americans. That same study found that immigration has a negative effect on low-income natives by lowering wages in low-income jobs. Immigrant labor mostly benefits owners of capital rather than the ""working man.""

The study also found that first-generation immigrants cost $1,600 each to local and state budgets. But, the second and third-generation of those immigrants add a net-positive of $1,700 and $1,300 respectively. So the immigrants actually end up contributing more than their ""fair share.""

Immigration in general has a positive effect on the American economy. It doesn't help or hurt native-born Americans equally - it is very complex. You pointed out that people are out of work or in need of assistance in the US. Could it be possible that those are symptoms of a problem unrelated to immigration? For example, companies are seeing record-breaking profits and yet, the average wage hasn't increased at the same pace. Instead of companies choosing to increase worker's wages from their profits, that money is going to shareholders.",True,False,0,1525163603,,1525166419,0,dy9bak0,False,t3_8g6q5g,True,t1_dy9b7ke,/r/AskReddit/comments/8g6q5g/why_should_or_shouldnt_we_give_citizenship_to/dy9bak0/,,1526942466,3,False,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public

Yes, because the chocolate is regulated and has to follow the same safety and health guidelines in both Germany and Spain. Can a UK citizen sell his chocolate in Spain?

&gt;and the UK wakes up on Mar 30 to a world in which the question of whether they want a withdrawal agreement evaporates and any question of regulatory demands by the EU over the UK are gone.

And so are the trade deals with literally the entire rest of the world. 
Besides you guys continue to assume a level of equality that just does not exist.

Most country in the world could afford cutting the UK from their trades.
Pretty much nobody can hope to cut the EU from their trades and not have a third world level economy.
and you are there trying to devise brilliant plans to not only abandon the EU, but to assume a hostile position towards it?

The EU does not want a no deal because... why would they? But don't confuse making smart decisions with leverage, you have no leverage whatsoever, no cards to play. If you make a no deal a better option than a deal, the EU can easily afford a no deal, the UK can't.",True,False,0,1525166674,,False,0,dy9cmmi,False,t3_8g1rg6,False,t1_dy9bgb3,/r/brexit/comments/8g1rg6/chaotic_uk_crashout_looms_if_border_solution_cant/dy9cmmi/,,1526943210,7,False,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,public

Erm... [only when they look like this](https://previews.123rf.com/images/upperkase/upperkase1306/upperkase130600048/20478794-shipping-container-on-articulated-trailer-and-lorry-on-uk-motorway.jpg). Most of the time they don't have containers on them when they're using ferrys or roads.

&gt;It is simply not a feasible facility for Northern Irish roads (where do you put them that people don't just drive a different way)

You put them on the main crossing points, smaller roads are low risk due to less goods traffic, but can easily be monitored by ANPR (say for a high volume of goods vehicles crossing, or one car making lots of journeys ect.), as lots of roads in the UK are anyway.

&gt;doesn't even address the problem the EU's actually worried about, and nobody has any interest in making it feasible.

Then pick 3 pictures circa 2013-2014 of the very beginnings of the migrant invasion into Italy, Germany, Paris, the UK, Sweden, etc, where we saw the same ""we love migrants"" groupies handing out water and giving out hugs to crowds of a similar size starting to cross into Europe... pictures which we all know looking back 5 years later represented the beginnings of the end of Europe.  Now be completely honest and tell me truthfully, if we laid out the 3 pictures from Europe 2013-2014 and the 3 pictures from our border today side by side, would you be able to tell that the pictures were taken years apart?  Would you know that the pictures were taken thousands and thousands of miles apart?  Would you even think for a second that the pictures weren't all taken at one event and not over multiple years across multiple countries?  I'm being dead serious here.  Because I can't tell the difference.  And this is what scares me.  This is EXACTLY what I saw happen in Europe at first.  Smaller numbers like this, welcoming crowds, water being passed out, chants of ""we will take your country for ours"", flags the countries the invaders came from being waved around.  People claiming to be refugee's or ""migrants fleeing poverty"" with iphones.  And then I remember how the event repeated itself over and over as the european populace sat back and let itself get destroyed until some started fighting back after they realized they were being invaded but by then it was too late.  I remember the sky rocketing number of terror attacks, acid attacks, crimes against children and unspeakable atrocities we all know about and hear about with regularity now that I won't go into for the sake of those who can't stomach hearing about it anymore.  But tell me, honestly, if you can tell these are not the same event, because I am telling you all that honestly, I cannot.. and that scares me.

2. These people came in from central america/south america, where the open borders groups have been moving ""so called refugee's"" and terrorists have been organizing to sneak into the USA from south america through central america and then through mexico.  We're prosecuting a pathetic 11 people?  How many of the unknown nameless massess that just disappeared into our country today are radicalized?  How many are extremely supportive of sharia law?  How many did we just let slip into the country who support ISIS or whatever offshoot they call themselves now?  How many terrorists did we just let into our country today.  And how many attacks (god forbid) in the future will we trace to people who came across the southern border today, because if you watch intel congressional hearings with the military and with our wonderful patriotic men and women keeping us safe... they've testified that the radicals, that the ISIS's that the al quaeda's and etc's have all been propogating plans to get into the usa via southern border hoping by sneaking in with the illegals that regularly come through and across.  I'm truly concerned, I know our president is too, and I'm furious at the groups that encouraged this illegal behavior, at the governments that funded these caravans, and anyone who was complicit in instructing these people on how to cross and claim asylum, anyone who gave instruction, worked with these criminals, and in any way abedded the law breaking at our southern border, should be thrown in prison.  The group who runs this program apparently runs out of the usa.  Throw them in prison what they have done is illegal.  I'm very upset, I know our president is as well.

&gt; 
&gt; Please do correct my mistakes

Will do!

1. You got the vowel length wrong in seven out of 68 words. You spelled [*ān*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/an#Old_English) with a short *a*, [*drēamlīċ*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/007872) with a short *i*, [*blōma*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bloma#Old_English) with a short *o*, [*þȳ*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEy) with a short *y*, [*dēor*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deor#Old_English) with a short *e*, [*milde*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/milde#Old_English) with a long *e*, and [*hwā*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hwa) with a short *a*. You need to start memorizing vowel length with each word. That shouldn't be hard—for me it's automatic—as long as you sound out how words are pronounced in your head.
2. You keep mixing up when *c*, *sc*, and *g* are [palatalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Old_English#Palatalization) (that is, when they're pronounced [/t͡ʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate), [/ʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative), and [/j/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant) respectively). The words [*Englisċ*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Englisc), [*sċulan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan), [*fæġernes*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%A6gernes), [*ġecnāwan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gecnawan), [*ċearu*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cearu), [*herġan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herian), and [*ġesēon*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geseon) should all be palatalized. This should also be memorized along with each word, since it's part of how they're pronounced. Protip: *sc* is palatalized in every common word except for [*āscian*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ascian#Old_English) ('to ask'), which is usually *āxian* anyway.
3. You keep ending the infinitives with -en. Old English never had a standard spelling system like modern languages, but the vast majority of the time, scribes would end infinitives with -an.
4. 'āblysan' and 'þoteran' aren't words. You're thinking of [*āblysian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/037370) ('to blush') and [*þoterian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/031964) ('to wail'). It's actually really important to remember which verbs end in -ian, because they're inflected differently from all other verbs. There are also a lot of them.
5. You keep inflecting infinitives. You write '[hīe] sculon willaþ' twice, when it should be *[hīe] sċulon willan* ('[they] should want'). This is one of the most common mistakes language learners make. Your brain is like, 'We just inflected one verb, why not this one?' I still do it as a German student, though not anymore with Old English, which I'm better at.
6. The normal plural of [*weald*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/034746) ('forest') is *wealdas*, not 'walda'.
7. [*dōmian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/007812) is an exotic word; I'm not sure I've ever seen it before. The most common word for 'to praise' *herġan*, though it wouldn't be weird to see *lofian* either.
8. You keep using [*sċulan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan) and [*willan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/willan) to indicate the future. Those words were occasionally used that way in Old English, but normally *sċulan* means 'must' or 'should' and *willan* means 'to want', like with their German cognates [*sollen*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sollen#German) and [*wollen*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wollen#German). You see, Old English doesn't really have a future tense; what's called the 'present tense' is really just the 'non-past tense', and you use it for both the present and the future. That may seem primitive, but lots of modern languages don't have separate future tenses either, like Finnish, Chinese, and Swiss German. Surprisingly enough, it's never caused me trouble. 99% of the time, either contextual clues show you whether someone's talking about the future, or it doesn't matter. If you want to know more, you can read [this](http://cla-acl.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cowper_Hall_Bjorkman_Tollan_Banerjee-2015.pdf). 
9. Your sentence 'Híe sculon willa[n] þæt híe hæfdon þíne fægernesse gecnéowen' ('They shall wish that they had known your beauty') is interesting because it has one particular error that's subtle and rarely discussed. An Old English writer probably wouldn't say 'hæfdon ġecnāwen' for 'had known'. Though the present tense of 'have' was often used to form past participles, 'had' wasn't usually used for pluperfects. If you wanted to specify that an action had already been completed in the past, you'd just use the word [*ǣr*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A6r#Old_English) ('before'): *Hīe ǣr cūðon* 'they had known', literally 'they before knew'. Also the past participle of *ġecnāwan* is *ġecnāwen*, not 'ġecnēowen'.
10. One of your sentences reads 'animals *willaþ tō cunnenne* your gentle touch'. An Old English speaker would just say *willaþ cunnan* ('want to know'). *Willan* is a [modal verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb), so you follow it with a bare infinitive, without the word 'to'. Its modern English descendant is the same way: you'd say 'I will watch a movie', not 'I will to watch a movie'. If you're wondering, the other modal verbs in Old English are [*cunnan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cunnan) ('know how to'), [*durran*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/durran) ('dare to'), [*magan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magan#Old_English) ('can'), [*mōtan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motan#Old_English) ('may/must'), [sċulan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan#Old_English) ('should', 'have to'), and [þurfan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEurfan) ('need to'). There are also some verbs that can be used with or without *tō* completely interchangeably, like [*onġinnan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onginnan) (the most common word for 'to try' and 'to begin'). *Iċ ongann þæt hūs tō forlǣtenne, ac mīn hund ongann mē forbēodan* ('I started to leave the house, but my dog tried to stop me') is a completely correct sentence.
11. The word *strēam* doesn't usually mean 'river'. The most common word for river is [*ēa*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ea#Old_English).
12. 'Eall sceal dómae þé, hwa wæs'—Aside from the ones I've already pointed out, this has a couple interesting errors. First, the word *eall* in Old English works very much like in modern English: it means 'everything' when it's singular (*eall is gōd* 'all is well'), and 'everyone' when it's plural (*ealle sind wilcuman* 'all are welcome'). Second, the hw- words aren't used for relative clauses in Old English. Instead, you use [*þe*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/031544) or one of the words for 'that': *Iċ hæbbe þæt þū wilt* ('I have what you want'), *Þæt is se wer þe mē liccode* ('That's the man who licked me'), *Ġelǣrede menn on Europe wiston þǣre Eorðan sinuwealtnesse hūru sīþ þām Crēcisċan ūþwitan Platōn, se lifde fēower ældum ǣr Criste* ('Educated people in Europe have known the Earth was round at least since the Greek philosopher Plato, who lived four centuries before Christ').
13. You got the inflections of nouns and adjectives wrong a few times. Even the title, 'An Englisce Lēoþ', should be *Ān Englisċ Lēoþ*. I don't know if you're erring here because you don't understand the case system (very common for a beginner!) or because you didn't look up the right inflections, or both.

Correcting your mistakes and substituting a few words, this is how I would render your lēoþ:

*Wealdas cunnon þīnne naman, Kelān. Hīe wȳsċaþ þæt hīe þīne fæġernesse cūðen—sēftu fōtswaðu, drēamlīċe stefne. Wind singþ þē sārlēoþ and lofsangas. Blōman āblysiaþ for þām þe hīe þē ġesǣgon. Dēor willaþ cunnan þīnne mildan æthrine. Ēa þoteriaþ on langoðe for þīnre wiermðe. Stānas tōġīnaþ for sorge. Ealle herġaþ þē, þe wæs.*

I didn't actually realize how nice it was until I read it twice. You have an appreciation for beauty.

Anyway, given the fact that you're a beginner and the kinds of errors you're making, I have a couple suggestions. First, if you want to know more about a word, you should use [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and [the website for the Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/). The Bosworth-Toller is easily the most useful resource I've seen; it contains almost every Old English word you come across, and it gives examples of when each one has been used, so you can look up how a word is used and not just its meaning and classification. You should also look up a word in wiktionary if you want to learn its etymology, how it's inflected, and which words in other languages it's related to. Remember that you need to note the gender, pronunciation, and inflections of all the words, 'cause right now it looks like you're just looking up the words themselves without minding how they're used or pronounced.

To learn the grammar of the language, you should read an introductory textbook. I recommend [this one](https://books.google.com/books?id=8TqrBgAAQBAJ), *Introduction to Old English*. You can download it [here](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=CD409DB9B7803CADFE481A110F185BE3) if you want.",True,False,0,1525174947,,1525190322,0,dy9ghqr,False,t3_8ftuee,True,t1_dy8dnri,/r/OldEnglish/comments/8ftuee/an_englisce_léoþ_for_keláne/dy9ghqr/,,1526945370,3,False,True,False,OldEnglish,t5_2tjrn,public

As a European I will say that isn't a positive at all because unfortunately what you don't take into account is the need for young people in the economy. Europe is a disaster since our age pyramids are inverted (we have more 40-50 year olds than 18-30 year olds). Soon our economies will grind to a halt when that generation retires and there arent enough people to fill qualified and non qualified roles. We also have massive unqualified immigration which is unable to integrate either society or the job market efficiently. Finally there is the fact that we have fertility below replacement rate which means we will be replaced by foreigners.

&gt; The problem lies in Africa. The African population is very rapidly increasing. Today the African population counts more than a billion people. By 2050 Africa would have 2.5 billion people, and 80% of these will be less than 30 years old. The problem with and underpopulated developed continent (400 million Europeans by 2050) sitting right next to an overpopulated undeveloped country is of course migration. European countries today already struggle to deal with immigration and the European borders are quite restricted (especially in the East), but imagine immigration today in a much, much larger scale.

That is generally a problem with the Southern hemisphere and especially with Africa. Simply put if there is a massive exodus, Europe at this point will implode similarely to the scenario of the great book (which I recommend although its depressing) **""Camp of saints"" by Jean Raspail**.

What probably happens in that scenario is some countries  capitulate whilst others (East Europe mostly) close their borders and wage aggressive war on the rest of the continent which has been taken over.

But I believe the end will not come from that. I think the end will come rather in a major war that will weaken European and American governments enough to ALLOW such masses to come into the country.

&gt; Drop Nineteens were a Boston-based indie rock band. They were one of a few U.S.-based bands who styled themselves on England's distinctive shoegazing sound, taking inspiration from bands such as Ride and Lush. Much like the Pixies before them, they were more widely acknowledged in the UK, where the then-unsigned Drop Nineteens first gained attention with two 8-track demos.

&gt; Signing to Caroline Records (home to Smashing Pumpkins, Hole), but with their records released on Hut in the UK, Drop Nineteens immediately garnered college radio airplay in the US with their 1992 debut album, Delaware. Formed by Greg Ackell (vocals, guitar), Steve Zimmerman (bass), Chris Roof (drums), Motohiro Yasue (guitar), and Paula Kelley (vocals, guitar), the band made three music videos that were prominently played on MTV. They also topped the UK's Indie Album &amp; Singles charts with early releases, toured on the success of their first album, headlined/co-headlined and opened tours in England, Europe, and North America, recorded BBC radio sessions for John Peel and Mark Goodier, and played summer music festivals like England's Reading Festival and North America's Lollapalooza.

&gt; Due to artistic differences, several member changes occurred between the first and second full length releases. Kelley, Roof, and Yasue went on to pursue other interests, and Megan Gilbert (vocals, guitar), Pete Koeplin (drums, now drummer for the band Kahoots) and Justin Crosby (guitar) were added to the lineup in 1993. Shortly thereafter, Drop Nineteens released their second full-length album, National Coma, but after a disappointing reaction to this record and various artistic differences the band broke up in 1995. 

&gt; Beyond Drop Nineteens, Ackell and Koeplin recorded an album under the band name Fidel in the late nineties, which was never formally released. Kelley went on to lead Hot Rod, Boy Wonder, and is currently a solo artist with the Paula Kelley Orchestra. Rumors of a third Drop Nineteens album have circulated over the past decade, but no release date has ever been announced.

You can annex *only* Fars and Khorasan instantly. You have to normally annex Sistan, Afghanistan and Transoxiana.

Also the cost to annex is 10 per development, and if you don't annex Transoxiana, opting to release them, they tend to back the rebellion of the remaining vassals. So the faster you annex Sistan and Afghanistan, the sooner you have Transoxiana who during this period you can safely keep under control as a march while stacking the Islam Iqta goverment's magical button powers i.e ""lenient taxation"" for a further -15% liberty desire. 

Also vassal feeding to annex is the proven way to cost save on admin points. So stacking the standard -50(45?)% diplomatic annexation cost(25% from here, 20-25% from a policy elsewhere) you can find from ideas lets you pay only 5 points per development.

Transoxiana once under control gets lots of liberty desire reduction due to culture group, ruling dynasty, same religion etc; thus making an ideal vassal to feed until they are about to pop at around 400 development. Since they already have a lot of land to support a small army, this makes them ideal for feeding them the rebellious lands in the steppes before annexing them.

Additionally Influence ideas gives a -20% to AE and halves the diplomatic cost to annex provinces that aren't part of the war goal.  Its events are also some of the kinder ones in the game. Some of the events have decent bonuses, most of the bad events give manageable negatives. If you have the -20% AE reduction and roll the ""Just Cause"" event, you get a whopping -40% AE which can be further stacked with a policy to -50%. This would allow you to pretty much steam roll an area of a map.

Finally Influence-Innovative gives a -10% advisor cost and -10% AE policy. Advisor cost reductions are invaluable for out of Europe nations that need to spend 2x the points typically to get the same tech as Europe. This is why Ming is cutting edge the most of the game; they get a -25% at full merit.

To charge 3 billion people $1100 more to subsidize half the world, while the other 3 billion don't, doesn't seem very ethical to me - considering that more specific indicators don't raise premium by nearly as much. Again, I don't have experience here.

I read an article a few days on propertycasualty360 that was talking about people who were fined for talking on the phone when driving, and whose premiums were raised on average by $300. Getting tickets in general raised premiums by $200-$1400. Surely a much more identifying piece of info like that should make a larger difference?

False,axsis,,,,"&gt; there's a reason lactose intolerance is a thing.

Yes but this depends on genetics and ancestry. I have no issues with dairy but I'll concede my SO reacts differently especially if it's slightly off. 

Additionally, there are cheeses with very small levels of lactose (cheddar, parmesan, brie, camembert, and swiss etc). I think the issue is very much framed in a particular political goal (that of encouraging veganism) since most lactose intolerance occurs with African and Asian populations, populations which generally made cheese without much lactose (e.g. Paneer) and did not necessarily adapt to it. 

So the statement: 
&gt; Our best diet is driven by evolutionary history, and we are the only mammal who continues to consume milk and milk byproducts beyond early childhood. It can't be good for us, there's a reason lactose intolerance is a thing.

Is false because as part of my European evolutionary history my body has adapted to process lactose reasonably well. To ignore our recent evolutionary history and go with a blanket statement is rather bizarre. Further the line: ""only mammal who continues to consume milk and milk byproducts"" is a denial of our pastoral history as a species. 

Now if I made a statement like ""Our closest relatives eat insects, therefore we should eat insects"", would you start eating insects?  

Or,  ""Our closest relatives don't eat a huge amount of meat"", or, ""Our closest relatives don't eat eggs regularly""... You can see this has the potential to be a huge rabbit hole and I'm sure I could find a way to phrase these in ways similar to the dairy statement, and this is why I detest the premise of the Paleo diet. It relies on Psuedoscientific cognitive bias...the idea that we can neglect evolution when it's convenient, it's the same as the vegetarians who claim we should be eating a barley rich diet because that's what 'Gladiators' ate...

False,Absolut_Null_Punkt,,,,"&gt; There is an old delicious Soviet joke about radio Yerevan: a listener asks “Is it true that Rabinovitch won a new car in a lottery?”, and the radio answers: “In principle yes, it’s true, only it wasn’t a new car but an old bicycle, and he didn’t win it but it was stolen from him.” Does exactly the same not hold for the fate of Marx’s teaching today, 200 years after his birth?

I lol'd.  


&gt; (1) it constitutes the majority of society; (2) it produces the wealth of society; (3) it consists of the exploited members of society; (4) its members are the needy people in society. When these four features are combined, they generate two further features: (5) the working class has nothing to lose from a revolution; (6) it can and will engage in a revolutionary transformation of society.[1] None of the first four applies to today’s working class, which is why features (5) and (6) cannot be generated

I'm curious as to how he qualifies his comments on the first four, that if the proletarian is no longer the majority (in a given society) then who is?  Is this statement a ""global"" one?  If so, then has the Proletariat every been the global majority?  Even in Marx's time there existed the large swaths of peasantry, hunter gatherer, tribal, and other pre Capital social groups.  

Point 5 I think has always been a bit more fluid.  There are always reactionary elements within the working class who act in a manner contrary to their ""class interests"" because their way of life will be changed in one way or the other.  Access to commodities is an intoxicating influence and their absence terrifies both the reactionary and class conscious proletarian.  

The historical example of ""reactionary proletarians"" has always defined those who were politically opposed to ""Stalinist"" regimes.  For many this is still what they mean when they say ""reactionary"".  But in 2018 can we say that these working class people were wrong, even if they couldn't articulate precisely why, since the reasoning wouldn't have been known before the implementation of these policies.  

&gt; The historical deadlock of Marxism resides not only in the fact that it counted on the prospect of capitalism’s final crisis, and therefore couldn’t grasp how capitalism came out of each crisis strengthened. 

I mentioned this in a few other posts on this sub in the past month or so.  Specifically that Marx, Lenin, Bordiga, and the likes of Malcolm X made comments and analysis absent the past 60 years of Capital crisis and Revolutionary failures.

&gt;  The latest version of this idea relates to the refugees: only an influx of a really large number of refugees can revitalize the European radical Left. This line of thought is thoroughly obscene and cynical. 

Agreed on this point, and wonder if this thought process is rooted in the self aggrandizing attitude of the modern Leftist where ""we just have to educate them properly"".  

&gt; The point is not just that revolution no longer rides the train of History, following its Laws, since there is no History, since history is a contingent open process. The problem is a different one: it is as if there were a Law of History, a more or less clear predominant main line of historical development, and that revolution could only occur in its interstices, “against the current.” Revolutionaries have to wait patiently for the (usually very brief) period of time when the system openly malfunctions or collapses, seize the window of opportunity, grab the power which at that moment as it were lies on the street, is up for grabs, and then fortify its hold on power, building repressive apparatuses, etc., so that, once the moment of confusion is over and the majority gets sober and is disappointed by the new regime, it will be too late to get rid of it, given its firm entrenchment.

I left my first PhD program after two years and after that took up a teaching job for two years and now I am planning to apply for the PhD on   the same topic again. In my first PhD i was not a failure , I took all  advanced level  courses and got decent grades. However my advisor who  is a nice person  otherwise works very fast and wants immediate results  while since it is  theoretical physics I was in general overwhelmed by  the sheer amount of  things I did not know and needed some time to  adjust while the advisor  just wanted to pick up topic and start working  and had little patience  for mistakes which I made a lot in the  beginning. I got very little time  to absorb things on my own and since I  am mostly a self taught person  it was more difficult for me to work as  per his schedule. He advised me  to change advisor however no one in  our department was working on the  same topic and changing advisor would  have meant changing topic of my  PhD which I was not willing to do. So I  just quit my PhD ,took two years  break , did projects with other  postdoc , faculties of different  universities and currently have four  papers under my belt. Have very  strong background on all advanced  topics in Physics. And am extremely  comfortable with research now \(  something I was not during my first PhD  since I have had time to absorb  thing my way\) I have managed to secure  two letter of recommendations  which are not from my ex advisor. Although  we ended up on amicable  terms , his opinion was that I am not going to  make a successful  researcher so we are not in contact anymore.

Most recently we had a holiday get together and before we even had dinner, my grandmother got angry over something trivial, screamed at everyone (in front of friends, too - this wasn't just family, these were people who didn't even *know* her) and she got up, left, and told my father in no uncertain terms to go fuck himself, and that we're all just a bunch of rude fucks who don't care about her.  

It was supposed to be a nice evening, and she ruined it.   This was a constant in my childhood, people *ruining* things.  Birthdays, graduations, vacations to Europe, all of them were like this.

&gt; Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.

&gt; Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. 

&gt; The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.

&gt; After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).

&gt; In November 2006 Condon was ""briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion"", the band's website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. 

&gt; Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec &amp; Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon's previous efforts. The second EP 'Holland' was credited to Condon's old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.

&gt; The band's album ""The Rip Tide"" was released in 2011.

False,FriedJesus,,,,"Like I said, I don't think all US police officers are terrible people and they purposefully kill people just for fun, but I see waaaaay to many video's on reddit alone, not to think you have a serious problem with your police force. I do agree that the Media sensationalizes a lot and I often see videos where the cops handled a situation pretty much perfectly, but that doesn't make a video like this or Daniel Shaver or the one where a guy gets beaten on by 5 guys for jaywalking any less terrifying. 

&gt;European countries don't have 50% of their crime committed in big cities, by black people, against black people, nor do they have the thug culture or glorification of violence and crime that our ghettos have. When Europe has crime like us, then you go ahead and compare, but our crime is just nothing alike. Your version of crime is a man running around naked or a shouting match, ours is gang violence and 30% of our murders being unsolved.

First of all, what a ridiculous over-generalization. Europe isn't one single country. Where I live we have plenty of pretty fucked up crimes, not to mention terrorist attacks. Especially in cities and especially in certain neighborhoods where police are scared to patrol and there's a heavy anti-police, anti-western culture sentiment. However we still manage to not shoot a thousand people every year. Second of all, 30% of murders unsolved? Isn't that the police fucking up? You think that stat somehow supports your argument?

&gt;when they say ""18 times"", you're thinking of police holding the trigger for 5 seconds at a time. 

No, I wasn't. I'm perfectly aware with how a taser works and I watched the video. There was no reason to taser the guy in the first place. Tasers are pretty dangerous weapons, even though most of the time they're non-lethal, they can cause serious heart problems. I didn't see any signs of resisting before the first tase. The guy just seemed confused and scared. 2 police officers should be strong enough to just take the guy and hold him, or at least ATTEMPT that before you reach for a taser, for fuck's sake. 

&gt;Nobody tells you how 600 out of the 750 people shot had a deadly weapon, most of the time a gun. Nobody mentions that a dozen cops are assassinated a year. But everybody loves a story that could paint the millions of police officers as tyrannical or brutal because of the actions of less than 12 a year.

Really? Just by a quick google search I found that US officers shot and killed almost 1000 people in 2017, sure most of them had a gun or were fleeing, but in 22 cases they were unarmed, not fleeing and didn't have any sort of mental illness. By contrast the UK police officers killed 5 people in all of 2017. All of them were legitimate terrorists. If you deny that your country doesn't have any sort of issue with your police force, I'm sorry, but you're a moron.

Northern Ireland doesn't get to veto the will of the British people. If the fighting starts again then that is the responsibility of those who do the fighting.

Not everyone in the EU is white. Every single EU member state has the power to give everyone in the world EU citizenship which would allow them to move to the UK. Tens of millions of the most illiberal peoples on the planet would be able to move to the UK, and we'd only be able to deport them after 3 or 6 months (I forget which).

Nobody is incentivised to treat anybody better unless it is conducuve to profit making. If slave labour were conducive to profit making in our current circumstances in the USA and europe, it would be happening, thankfully it isn't.

Why I think tech didn't change:
Besides the fact that it did, this slowness you are alluding to is due to one simple thing, which is the fact that people are only free to innovate if they have the time and the means to do so. Technology devaloped before the devalopement of capitalism made large scale production possible, which made less people needing to work for our basic survival needs and more possibilitys to invent, irregardless of capitalism.

The fact that soviet russia couldn't compete with the US is found in global capitalism. The USSR might have called itself socialist, but really what it was was state capitalism (aka a system in which the state is the only capitalist). Given this, the policies they had enacted to appear socialist made them unviable in the long run, as they needed to import some goods. Other factors may include geography, demographics and many, many more.

Also, any structure that centralised is very unstable if it requires its citicins to create the wealth since many people want to be at the head and can organise against the ruling class because of the things the ruling class has to maintain to create said wealth. 

BTW: the rennesaince is bullshit as anything else than an concept in art history, not really other subcategories of history.

False,ready-ignite,,,,"&gt; Set aside the fact no one asked Israel to be the independent police of this agreement.

Note that senior US officials including Pompeo flew into Jordan, then traveled to Israel, the evening before this speech. In addition issued a [statement](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-pompeo-saudi-arabia-iran-20180428-story,amp.html) just before then that the US stands with Israel and Saudi Arabia against Iran. The US was present for the event indicating alignment with the message.

&gt; *What we are seeing is a dance. A play. A theatrical performance *meant to appease the general population and generate just enough apathy in the general public that those in power don't feel they'll lose power attacking Iran. This has happened before. It's happening again. No one will care. No one can stop it.

I agree that this is a theatrical performance. I see indications that this is not run-up to war however, but setting the table for negotiations similar to what we observed in North Korea.

Go back to Nancy Pelosi's statement a week or two ago regarding her trip to North Korea. In it her aide whistles at her indicating she has delved into classified territory when she brings up the topic. She cavalierly continues on anyway, seemingly oblivious to the signal, and describes how when weapons development was brought up as a topic the North Korean's stated they eagerly offered weapons sale to the US dignitaries. Demonstrates sign that weapons development was for economic reason for sale on the black market. 

Reviewing North Korea and the tech available within the country, the country does not demonstrate a top notch R&amp;D capability exists. Take a close look at their soldier parades in recent years. The weapons they carry are old 1950s tech with oddity modifications such as a heavy cylindrical mag welded to them. Not something in practice you'd want to carry around and not particularly effective. Then look at the rapid advancement of missile and nuclear research effort, in a country struggling to keep the power on. Where did the technical know-how and ability to execute on designs come from?

Assume coming out of that Pelosi meeting an arrangement was made. Or maybe already existed. Intel agency provides weapons design and manufacture expertise to the country, NK sells on the black market to rebel insurgency groups or other rogue countries, intel agency gets a cut of funds changing hands for dark money off the books projects. Think to the cartels in Breaking Bad, or even Scarface. Once you're in an arrangement such as this, you're running drugs for the cartel, what happens if you ever try to back out? What happens if you don't hit your sales targets? Once these arrangements were in place one would presume that with communication lines and access to the country came with it means to reach out and harm NK leadership. The problem with war in the peninsula in that scenario is a hostage situation. Leverage, negotiation with, or otherwise eliminate the hostage takers pressuring for continued profiteering would be the key lever toward a peaceful solution.

Assume Iran is in a similar hostage scenario with deals to make arms production available on the black market in return for weapons R&amp;D support. The fun case of Uranium 1 comes back into play again. Where did the uranium go after leaving the US? We know it went by trucking company through Canada. We know it then went on to the EU passing through to presumably Russia. Where did it go from there? How is it being used? Did any of it go to Iran? What about North Korea?

How about after the Iran deal? Any chance there was relocation of Iranian nuclear program into Syria, including Uranium 1 material? Are we able to track flights into Syria that elude to such a relocation? Does the money flowing into Iran as part of the nuclear deal with the US currently fund the ongoing program? How much of the funding from that US/Iranian deal is skimmed off by the EU?

If there is merit here, can the table be flipped and lay groundwork for new negotiations by negotiating with or otherwise cutting ties with any group in a position to apply pressure on Iran, keeping them in the weapons for black markets game? Freed from those economic arrangements, could Iran then negotiate in good faith and created a new path forward similar to what we see developing in North Korea?

It is interesting that Netanyahu stopped at discussing historic events. The presentation is left not particularly persuasive in and of itself. It looked like theater serving a couple points, on one hand informing the public of behind the scenes detail here. The public should question whether it's a trustworthy source or not. I suspect by end of the week or early next week after there has been some time for discussion that we'll get additional statements describing nuclear targets already hit by missile strikes in Syria. On the other side it puts cards on the table signaling to EU, Iran, and other players that it's time to end the round and get to work on next steps. 

The story appears to be that either a high level defector from Iran came in, Israel got someone deep inside the program, carried out some sort of raid to acquire materials, or is just making it all up. The response from Iran has not been to come out and state it's all made up. Instead they made noises of leaving the US/Iran deal. Thus I'm leaning toward higher probability the materials exists. That gets in potential that methods and means Israel used to acquire materials may come under scrutiny and the ability to use those methods closed. Not ideal. Thus has to be a big reason for showing the information displayed.

It's possible this does lead to beating of war-drums similar to Iraq or other misadventures. We should keep in mind that history does not necessarily repeat, but kinda rhymes.

False,The-Autarkh,california-flag,,California,"&gt;There are some arguments so dumb only President Trump could take them seriously. That’s the only conclusion you could reach after seeing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s faux-dramatic speech yesterday, in which he literally pulled a sheet off of a pile of documents, like a magician unveiling a cage full of doves, to demonstrate Iran’s dishonesty about its nuclear program.

&gt;The point of the act was to convince Trump to pull out of the nuclear agreement negotiated in 2015 between the United States, Iran, China, Russia, France, the U.K, Germany, and the European Union, and it just might succeed.

&gt;Which in turn could make a nuclear agreement with North Korea all but impossible.

&gt;As you look around at these high-stakes matters of foreign policy and national security, you quickly realize that everyone, no matter which side they’re on, takes it as a given that the president of the United States is an infantile half-wit, and they must adjust their strategies accordingly.

&gt;...

&gt;It’s more than obvious that Trump wants to pull out of the nuclear agreement and always has. But up until now he’s been restrained by a group of sane senior advisers who have repeatedly insisted to him that the agreement is successfully restraining Iran and that if it disintegrated, there would be little to stop Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon, exactly the outcome Trump claims he wants to avoid and that the agreement was intended to forestall.

&gt;Unfortunately, with the departures of Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, that group has been reduced to one person: Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Just last week Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee “the verification, what is in there, is actually pretty robust as far as our intrusive ability,” because “it is written almost with an assumption that Iran would try to cheat.” Mattis now finds himself outnumbered, because Tillerson and McMaster were replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two longtime critics of the deal who seem only too happy to see it collapse. Bolton in particular has long advocated military action against Iran.

&gt;So right now you have one person, Mattis, who is trying to prevent Trump from doing what he really wants to do, and two people, Pompeo and Bolton, who are encouraging him to give in to his desires and walk away from the agreement. Who do you think is going to win that argument?

&gt;But it doesn’t stop there. If you were Kim Jong Un and you saw the United States abandon a painstakingly negotiated agreement to restrain Iran’s nuclear program, how could you possibly trust that that whatever promises were made to you in exchange for scrapping your own weapons would be kept?

&gt;Unfortunately, with the departures of Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, that group has been reduced to one person: Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Just last week Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee “the verification, what is in there, is actually pretty robust as far as our intrusive ability,” because “it is written almost with an assumption that Iran would try to cheat.” Mattis now finds himself outnumbered, because Tillerson and McMaster were replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two longtime critics of the deal who seem only too happy to see it collapse. Bolton in particular has long advocated military action against Iran.

&gt;There, too, everyone is acting like Trump is a fool. South Korean president Moon Jae-in, when it was suggested that he be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to ease the conflict with North Korea, replied: “President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize.” He said this knowing full well that nobody’s getting any prizes before any true agreement is reached, especially given the many times the North and South have briefly opened up ties and promised newly warmed relations only to slip back to the status quo. But he also knows that Trump’s massive ego and rampaging insecurity mean that showering him with praise is the best way to get what you want from him.

&gt;One world leader after another, from Netanyahu to Moon to Xi Jinping to Emmanuel Macron to the Saudis who gave him that gold medal, has realized that this president is easy to manipulate. Treat him like a big shot, shower him with compliments, tell him what he wants to hear, and he’ll be putty in your hands, at least for a while.

&gt;But eventually Trump has to make a decision. And when he takes the U.S. out of the Iran agreement, as he probably will, that will all but guarantee that Kim won’t be willing to scrap his nukes because the United States says it will give North Korea something in return.

Seize the institutions that promote it. A bureau which censors public media, as well as purging most academics from their positions to be replaced by people who aren't anti-nation and anti-family could solve most of the problems. The fact is that most reactionary positions are neuro*typical*, if people were left alone they would simply drift towards them naturally. The constant indoctrination by media and government and academia tries to suppress it, but the tendencies are still there.

&gt;How do you propose to create an ethnostate?

Reactionaries are not necessarily pro-ethnostate as some on the alt-right are. We see it as a good thing, but we're more spiritual than we are racially based. The typical ""Spencer"" argument seems to be deportations as well as encouragement for more white immigration. Jared Taylor by contrast argues that if you get rid of the institutional bias against whites identifying as whites, then an ethnostate will develop organically--perhaps somewhere in the midwest.

&gt;How do you propose to counter the international cabal of Globalists?

You make it sound like a conspiracy theory rather than greedy and insane bastards destroying our countries for their own gain. The fact is that the best way to stop ""the globalists"" is to create a society where the merchant class doesn't hold all the power.

To some degree, we still see things in the manner of three estates: Aristocracy making up the warriors of a society, Clergy making up the priestly class, and Merchants making up the politicians and businessmen. Each ""class"" is important for the basis of maintaining a civilized society, and its the way of things that each society can cycle through the three classes; Aristocracies tend to form dictatorships and monarchies. The Clergy tends to create societies bound by faith, such as the Islamic caliphates or to some degree, Western Europe during the ""dark age"" immediately following the Western Roman Empire's collapse.

All three classes are important to maintaining society, but its the way of the merchant class to be the most troublesome. Without warriors, a society is weak and can be conquered easily. Without clergy and religious guidance, societies become immoral and prone to their own destruction. Without the merchants, societies can become poor and find themselves obedient to foreign powers. Yet given the only value of the merchants is gold, they tend to push the envelope in the form of social change: they can talk a big game about ""Women's rights"", but all it really boils down to for liberals is more human resources to exploit. Things like virtue, or identity, mean nothing to them and may actually hamper them, so they seek to push things to the next extreme, always at the cost of society as a whole.",True,False,0,1525197915,,False,0,dya2oks,False,t3_8g0ptx,True,t3_8g0ptx,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/8g0ptx/all_i_have_some_questions_about_various/dya2oks/,,1526958215,1,False,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,public

My mistake. A legitimate brain fart. Though if you use a Pacific Ocean centered map then it still follows. The Caribbean including T&amp;T are east of the Pacific and Africa is west of Pacific (as well as west of Asia).

&gt;second, caribbean accents and african accents often have a lot in common due to common languages in a lot of the caribbean countries being spanish/french/english pidgins. t&amp;t in particular has a lot of descendants of african slaves who were brought from spain's colonial holdings in africa. 

It'd be like saying Louisiana creole or AAVE sounds like an African accent or American or Canadian English sounds like a European accent.  Also what does that even mean? A Yoruba person from Nigeria doesn't sound like a Xhosa person from South Africa or a Somalian or an Egyptian. A T&amp;T accent is most similar to other english speaking countries in the americas. It's not an African accent. Like you stated it has been influenced by colonial european languages, african languages, and Indian languages it is distinct enough not to be considered an ""african accent"" which like I said is a dubious phrase to begin with.

The GFA is an international treaty, not an internal UK matter. One party of the treaty is an EU member and this member chose to bring the open questions into the Brexit negotiations.

Doubt it. There are dozens of agreements which stand in the way of a fudge. The MFN clause of the WTO, the self-determination of the EU itself, Turkey's and Ukraine's customs arrangements, the pan Euro-Mediterrranean convention, basic WCO rules, several FTAs of the EU, open skies agreement...

Come on. That's not a serious proposition.

Yes. The UK decided that the rest of the Commonwealth wasn't worth any more to subsidize. New Zealand wasn't happy about the accession of the UK into the EC.

Yes. It is not the end of the world, but the UK redefines its international position fundamentally. It will be a less close, less compromising and perhaps even antagonistic towards other EU members. The interests will diverge more and more.

&gt;So you are equating the UK leaving the EU, with Germany signing a military memorandum with a hostile power? the hostile bit would be enabling a hostile power and bringing that to the borders of its fomrer allies..

Yes. It would be a fundamental redefinition of Germany's international positioning, as it is Brexit.

False,CaravanOfDeath,,5abe77de-24f8-11e5-bb11-0ef63926eacd,#HighToryGang,"The planned visit of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to the United Kingdom in July is well-timed and of great importance. By then the European Union Withdrawal Bill ought to have passed into law and a mere three months of negotiations are scheduled to settle the terms of our departure. Once we have left our alliance with the EU, the United States will be even more central to our foreign policy than it currently is, especially as we are unlikely to be flavour of the month with the EU after our departure.

It is our national good fortune that the president with whom we will develop this new arrangement is Mr Trump. His election depended upon similar factors to those that led to Brexit. He appealed to voters left behind by the metropolitan elite and he exudes confidence about his own nation and a determination not to be a manager of decline, which also inspires the Brexiteers.

This has had an important effect on American foreign policy which had consistently supported Britain’s engagement with the European Union from the days of the Coal and Steel Community in the 1950s. Former President Obama’s rude and counterproductive intervention in the referendum debate, telling us to get to the back of the queue, was an undiplomatic reminder of how the US saw its position.

It will, therefore, be necessary to show the Americans how our departure from the EU will be in their national interest, too. Donald Trump has supported Britain’s decision to leave the EU out of conviction and principle but if that could be bolstered by robust self-interest, so much the better.

The standard US view was that Britain could temper the incipient hostility to its power within the European councils. The proposition was that if one of the key member states were a true friend who could lessen some of the jealousy and unnecessary competitiveness exhibited towards the US this would advance America’s interests. In this way Britain could make an important regional power marginally more helpful to the US in pursuing its global aims.

The US accepted that because of its ties to the EU, Britain could not be as supportive as it might otherwise have wished to be in all circumstances. It could be held back by the sometimes irrational concerns of other member states, and the unwillingness to impose sanctions against Russia in recent years is a case in point.

As the US is about to lose a moderating ally in a major but sometimes difficult regional organisation, what is it going to get in return? This is where Britain has something genuine to offer to America, for so many of its values are similar. Indeed, with the common law and a parallel constitutional settlement the two nations are the world’s most longstanding democracies.

Free from its ties to the EU, Britain will be able to co-operate more fully with the US in its global efforts. Sometimes the sheer size and power of America makes it harder for it to deal with a smaller nation with whom we may have an excellent relationship.

In this way Britain can change from being a lukewarm friend exercising a calming influence to having a real special relationship. This is only “special” if it is in the United States’ interest, for every country in the world knows that its link to America is its overriding foreign relationship. Whether it is Germany, India, Israel or Taiwan, all view their link to the US as “special” but for America all this specialness is routine.

After Brexit, the US and Britain could push our shared values in all international forums, arguing for new solutions for the next generation rather than being held back by the EU’s efforts to protect vested interests.

However, this opportunity is dependent upon Mr Trump’s presidency. Without him the US would be offering no support for Brexit and would be seeking to frustrate it. He ought to be treated with every possible courtesy when he comes, both as befits the office he holds and in gratitude for his goodwill towards the nation of his mother’s birth. The red carpet that is laid out must be spotless and the evidence of our close relationship on clear display.

In addition, we would be wise to offer the US something tangible that would help the president’s agenda, not just fine words. If that means presenting a free trade deal or suggesting a London-New York agreement on financial regulation, which would become the global standard, the duty of “sincere co-operation” with the EU must not be an impediment. Opportunities need to be grasped and not evaded because of passing bureaucratic convenience.

Inevitably there will be demonstrations when Mr Trump visits but the US constitution has greater protections for freedom of speech than our own, so protest is part and parcel of political life. It is the official welcome that matters and it should be of the greatest warmth, ideally backed up by a clear vision of how our two great nations can co-operate in future.

Perhaps then Harold Macmillan’s vision of our playing the Greeks to America’s Romans would at last be fulfilled.

It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774. In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire. After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom.

You don't seem to know much about the history of fishing in the UK and the EU, but current quotas are based on historical catches of fish by member States within that area, before the common fisheries policy and before even the EU. Do you want to know what's responsible for the decline of the UK fishing industry? Fishermen and mechanisation.

You know all the stories you hear about harbours having a thousand boats and now only having ten? Guess what, the boats are 100 times the size and capable of catching 1000 times the fish. In the late 90s the EU actually gave UK fishermen 90% grants to build bigger and better boats, those boats then went out and through mismanagement nearly caused the collapse of North Sea fish stocks. The only thing that saved those stocks were quotas and technical conservation measures, each and everyone fought against tooth and nail by the fishing industry. Fishermen don't like regulation. That's the issue and time and time again they've shown that if left to their own devices, they'll take until no more can be taken (have a read about the grand banks cod stocks for a detailed picture of where out fleet would be if it wasn't for the North Sea recovery plan, introduced by the EU.)

False,Casualbat007,,,,"The circumstances surrounding that treaty are extremely complicated, I will do my best to give you a concise, helpful answer without re-writing one of my capstone papers:

Hitler and the Nazis were well aware that their ideologies (the return of lands lost in the aftermath of WWI, uniting all other ethnic-Germans into one state and annexing lands to the east for living space) would mean that they would have to fight another general war in Europe. France and Great Britain were clearly their main foes, as the Soviet Union was not considered to be a major player by either side in the run up to the conflict. 

In WWI, Germany had absolutely crushed the Russian Empire and contributed greatly to the conditions that resulted in the fall of the Tsar and the rise of the Bolsheviks. Since then, the Russians had fought a brutal civil war, saw the rise of totalitarianism under Stalin, and experienced mass famine, arrests and purges. To the other European powers, the Soviet Union seemed to be struggling to function as a state altogether, and otherwise seemed to be in no position to fight any war. However, Stalin saw the writing on the wall, the Nazis were very open and clear in their belief that Bolshevism and Jewry were one and the same and could not coexist with Nazism. Therefor he many numerous attempts to nail out an ironclad military alliance with France and Great Britain. 

But the Nazis were not the only ones who were wary of the communists. The Russian revolution, as most of Europe saw, wasn't about the Tsar or Russia specifically but rather the destruction of capitalism everywhere it is being practiced. Since all of Europe was ""capitalist"" at least by the Bolshevik standard, they felt extremely threatened, and were very motivated to contain, not encourage, the spread of Communism. Add these views of the Soviet State with the aforementioned perceived political, economic and military chaos, Great Britain and France frankly didn't think the Soviets would participate in the next war, and would be more of a burden than a help if they did. For these reasons, Stalin was left on the eve of war without any solid alliances, and became more open to last-minute options. 

For as much as they swore themselves arch enemies, the Soviets and the German government had been cooperating since the end of WWI out of necessity. The Versailles treaty prevented Germany from operating any Tank or air units or developing doctrine, so they agreed with the Soviets in 1929 to set up a training facility in the Soviet Union where, ironically, they developed many of the Blitzkrieg tactics that would later be used against them in 1941. In exchange, the Soviets received help with their industrial efforts and 5 year plans through the sharing of technologies. The Germans, additionally, needed huge amounts of resources from the Soviet Union to build and then maintain their new armies. The Germans additionally suspected the Royal Navy would construct a naval blockade like they did in the First World War, so resources over land from the Soviet Union would become even more essential when the war broke out. It was strongly in Germany's interest to keep friendly with the Soviets until they dealt with the more formidable Western Allies. 

The Germans saw Stalin, rejected by the allies, in no position to go to war, and friends with nobody.  They saw an opportunity to Guarantee the Soviets would not side with the Allies, to secure their resource channels until the moment they saw fit, and to create an element of surprise when they decided to strike. The treaty, at the time, mutually benefited both countries, and Stalin was relieved to know he had at least bought his country some time to prepare for eventual entry in the war.

 



However, as we all know, Germany breaking the pact with Operation Barbarossa might be the most successful surprise attack in history. Its reported that Stalin, arguably the most paranoid man in history,  was not seen or heard from for weeks after the event he was so shook to his core. 

Hope this helps!

Multiculturism brought tourism and a huge revenue for its citizens. It actually envelops more than a third of all jobs in our capital city. It also allows us to study or work abroad thus giving us better chances at life.

The common army would help us as well since most smaller countries have an abysmal army size even though they occupy strategic positions. Like the Baltic states, Greece etc.

The common budget allows to finance growth in poorer regions so they develop faster to reach the levels of the bigger states. Even some larger countries have parts that need these funds like Spain, Italy and even some tpwns in France (france is too centralized arpund Paris) I can't count how many stuff got funded in my country by the EU. From highways that benefit other countries as well, to schools and parks. Heck even the college i visit was built by EU funds. 

Most of the money that countries give to the EU fund is given back to the same countries as projects and benefits. Its just like a carefully managed fund so that it get fairly shared and much more efficient.

The common law also instated better worker and consumer laws. We benefit from better food quality, pharmaceutical drug quality, electronics, etc. The laws also curtailed corruption due to the economic rules and the fiscal rule.

And you do have control over EU politicians. Each state even has a leadership mandate. And you have EU parliament elections. You did vote right?

Ireland's genetic history is a little discontinuous, with the invading/immigrating people ranging anywhere from platinum blonde to very dark brown.

9000 years ago, hunter-gatherers populated the island from Northern Spain/Southern France. Since then, there have been three major 'genetic' invasions: the Celts of continental Europe (2500 years ago), Norse-Vikings (1200 years ago), and the English (850 years ago). There is also, throughout all this time, starting about 5000 years ago, continuous but minor waves of immigration from Great Britain and Western France.

Of those groups, the English, Vikings, and French all had significant dark-haired populations. As for the original hunter-gatherers, it's hard to say because of how far back that is; they might have been very 'Spanish' looking, but they could also very well be the original pasty-white, gingers.

If you're an American, things get further complicated because Americans in modern times tend to massively underestimate their English ancestry. At some point, the English-American identity transformed into a generic American identity, so you'll hear people who are 3/4ths English and 1/4th German refer to themselves as German-American, simply because the latter happens to be more distinguishable.

It's not that confusing, and if you have an open mind, I'd provide a couple interesting texts that detail why these common conspiracies are flawed.

1) A Convenient Hatred: The History of Antisemitism

2) The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History

The rest of your instinct to ""name the Jew"" is mere confirmation bias. If you take, as many trendy neo Nazis are apt to do these days, thirty prominent Jews, and if you photoshop a star of David next to them, and if you create a collage of it, it's an easy psychological argument to say ""LOOK HOW MANY JEWS ARE IN MEDIA.""

The reality is you could find vastly more by sheer volume alone influential Christians and Asians. 

Even if you believe Jews are disproportionately successful, which they are, it's absurd to believe there is some weight they are pulling in a particular direction.

For starters, Ashkenazi Jews are genetically white. They are primarily comprised of Christian converts. Similarly, many European Christians--even Neo Nazis--have a history of hidden Jewish ancestors, who were threatened and forced into converting. 

Why are so many doctors Indian and Asian? Again, these stereotypes are rooted in confirmation bias, but perhaps there is a reason why certain cultures gravitate toward certain career paths. Still, the *vast majority of them are not*. 

The question is, *why does it bother you?*

If you believe that Jews are a hivemind, you are succumbing to irrational, hateful logic, and I encourage you to visit a reform synagogue or talk to a rabbi or attend a Shabbat service and realize that hate and bias arises when we stop seeing the individual.

See the individual. From Islamic extremism to Jewish settler bigots to fundamentalist Christians, hate arises when we stop seeing the individual humans and start to use labels and judgments.

Arm sales: $11.6 billion, total sales: $58.2 billion
Gross profit: $5.3 billion, total workforce: 199,900 
United Technologies makes a wide range of arms — notably military helicopters, including the Black Hawk helicopter for the U.S. Army and the Seahawk helicopter for the U.S. Navy. The company was the biggest employer in the top 10 though arms sales accounted for just 20% of revenue. UTX also produces elevators, escalators, air-conditioners and refrigerators. International sales comprised 60% of the company's revenue in 2012.

9. L-3 Communications (LLL) -- electronics
Arm sales: $12.5 billion, total sales: $15.2 billion
Gross profit: $956 million, total workforce: 61,000
Some 83% of L-3 Communications sales in 2011 came from arms sales, but this was down from what it sold the prior year. The company has four business segments: electronic systems; aircraft modernization and maintenance; national security solutions; and command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Among many products manufactured, the company has become a major provider of unmanned aircraft systems. 

8. Finmeccanica -- aircraft, artillery, engines, electronics, vehicles and missiles
Arms sales, $14.6 billion, total sales: $24.1 billion
Gross profit: $ -3.2 billion, total workforce: 70,470
Italian company Finmeccanica makes a wide range of arms, including helicopters and security electronics. Nearly 60% of the company's sales in 2011 were in arms. Finmeccanica lost $3.2 billion in 2011. The Italian company is currently fending off allegation that it paid bribes to win an approximately $750 million contract to provide 12 military helicopters to the Indian government in 2010. The then-head of the company, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested in February but has denied wrongdoing. Other executives, including the head of the company's helicopter unit, have been replaced, and the company has delayed the release of recent financial results.

7. EADS -- aircraft, electronics, missiles and space
Arm sales: $16.4 billion, total sales: $68.3 billion
Gross profit: $1.4 billion, total workforce: 133,120
The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), based in the Netherlands, had sales in 2011 roughly in line with the prior year. Arms sales comprised just 24% of the company's revenue. EADS and BAE Systems unsuccessfully attempted to merge for $45 billion in 2012, which would have created the world's largest aerospace company. The deal collapsed in October after German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concerns about the merger.

6. Northrop Grumman (NOC) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, ships, space
Arm sales: $21.4 billion, total sales: $26.4 billion
Gross profit: $2.1 billion, total workforce: 72,500
Northrop Grumman's 2011 arms sales comprised about 81% of total sales even after a sharp decline in arms sales year over year. The company attributed the decline to reduced government spending on defense projects. Nevertheless, the company was more profitable than in the prior year.

5. Raytheon (RTN) -- electronics, missiles
Arm sales: $22.5 billion, total sales: $24.9 billion
Gross profit: $1.9 billion, total workforce: 71,000
Raytheon, based in Waltham, Mass., is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company makes the Tomahawk Cruise Missile, among others. Arms sales comprised about 90% of the company's sales in 2011 though they as a total they were lower than in the prior year. The slide hasn't let up. Total sales in 2012 fell 1.5%, and Raytheon is expecting sales to fall 3% in 2013, a projection which doesn't take into account the effects of mandated budget cuts. The company can rely on overseas customers to somewhat offset weak sales at home. As of January, approximately 40% of the company's backlog was booked overseas. The company expects approximately a 5% increase in international sales in 2013.

4. General Dynamics (GD) -- artillery, electronics, vehicles, small arms, ships
Arm sales: $23.8 billion, total sales: $32.7 billion
Gross profit: $2.5 billion, total workforce: 95,100
With 18,000 transactions in 2011, General Dynamics was the third-largest contractor to the U.S. government. Of those contracts, approximately $12.9 billion worth went to the Navy, while an additional $4.6 billion went to the Army. The company's arms sales in 2011 comprised 73% of total sales. Arms sales in 2011 were slightly below 2010 levels. The company makes a host of products, including electric boats, tracked and wheeled military vehicles, and battle tanks. The company announced layoffs in early March, blaming mandated federal budget cuts.

3. BAE Systems -- aircraft, artillery, electronics, vehicles, missiles, ships
Arm sales: $29.2 billion, total sales: $30.7 billion
Gross profit: $2.3 billion, total workforce: 93,500
BAE Systems was the largest non-U.S. company based on arms sales. Arms sales represented 95% of the company's total sales in 2011 even though they were lower as a total of overall sales compared to the prior year. The products BAE sells include the L-ROD Bar Armor System that shields defense vehicles and the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer that provides sophisticated simulation training for military pilots. In 2013, the company said its growth would likely come from outside the U.S. and Great Britain — its home market. BAE noted that its outlook for those two countries was ""constrained,"" likely due to the diminished presence in international conflicts and government budget cuts.

2. Boeing (BA) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, space
Arm sales: $31.8 billion, total sales: $68.7 billion
Gross profit: $4 billion, total workforce: 171,700
Boeing was the second-largest U.S. government contractor in 2011, with about $21.5 billion worth of goods contracted. The Chicago-based company makes a wide range of arms, including strategic missile systems, laser and electro-optical systems and global positioning systems. Despite all these technologies, just 46% of the company's total sales of $68.7 billion in 2011 came from arms. Boeing is the largest commercial airplane manufacturer in the world, making planes such as the 747, 757 and recently, the 787 Dreamliner. The company is also known for its space technology — Boeing had $1 billion worth of contracts with NASA in 2011.

1. Lockheed Martin (LMT) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, space
Arm sales:$36.3 billion, total sales: $46.5 billion
Gross profit: $2.7 billion, total workforce, 123,000
Lockheed Martin notched $36.3 billion in sales in 2011, slightly higher than the $35.7 billion the company sold in 2010. The arms sales comprised 78% of the company's total 2011 sales. Lockheed makes a wide range of products, including aircraft, missiles, unmanned systems and radar systems. The company and its employees have been concerned about the effects of the ""fiscal cliff"" and sequestration, the latter of which includes significant cuts to the U.S. Department of Defense. In the fall of 2012, the company planned on issuing layoff notices to all employees before backing down at the White House's request

I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.

**When it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control people’s beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.**""

This was an incredible movie. As with the series; music, animation, background art are all a treat.

I however wasn't fond of Bebe, as I kept having PTSD flashback to episode 3..

I'm not sure how I would qualify the ending, bittersweet doesn't quite adequately describe how it feels. On one hand, ending with Madoka taking Homura with her would have been a beautiful ""happy"" ending, but on the other hand I'm not sure it would have been consistent with the rest of the series. All the wishes of the girls brought what was said to be equal amounts of hope and despair, with the exception of Madoka's wish. Homura turning evil kinda feels like restoring the balance in that regard.

Not relevant to the movie but I still have on question : who was the Walpurgisnacht Witch, and why did she become so powerful? Are clues hidden for a second rewatch? Did her power grow along Madoka's seeing as many fates and timelines depend on her existence?

&gt; education, healthcare, prisons

you couldn't have picked three better examples where capitalistic privatized profit orientation has produced far worse results than socialised systems if we look at it through metrics of equality of opportunity (the more equal i.e. less dependent on previous generations socio economic status the better), social divide (the smaller the better), freedom from fear of illness (less fear is better), or reduction of recidivism post prison (the lower the better). 

If we can agree on these metrics, then the last decades have given a very good case study on the performance of these three areas under a profit oriented privatization  (US) vs a more socialised doctrine (EU). Considering education, last time I checked the academic growth rate (measured on the number of relevant/cited published papers in STEM fields) of the US vs EU was looking quite bleak. Considering healthcare, making it a privatized venture the you are directly pinning public health vs corporate interest. You can compare the rate of uninsured/insufficiently insured people, compare the rate at which people go to regular checkups/take preventive measures or compare the insurance premiums people have to pay (and be careful to take into account their spread and who it affects the most). And at last considering prison: I don't see how a privatized system would a) have any interest in reducing recidivism and b) be actually a viable business venture not dependent on taxpayer money  without being effectively a slave labour camp. 

Also although yes you are technically right that these three things are ""not required for human life"" in that an individual will not necessarily die if they have no access to school, affordable healthcare or a prison system. Humans seem to be a social species and societies do seem to benefit greatly and prosper with providing access to education and helathcare, as well as keeping themselves healthy and relatively safe implementing a prison system to keep bad actors under control.

This is the sort of logic train that leads one to say that Stalin was actually the villain of WW2, not Hitler, since Hitler *only* killed six million jews, while Stalin killed *insert inflated number of all deaths that could ever possibly be attributed to Stalin here*.

There's other ways of thinking about this, though. What about all the people saved by US involvement in WW2? All those lives saved by the war ending quicker, and not living under a Communist regime? What about all the refugees the US *has* taken, leading to it having the largest Jewish population in the entire world? What about the Marshall plan rebuilding Europe, or America's role in role in forcing the west to give up its colonial possessions in the aftermath of WW2? Or any intervention the US has had with positive results, such as preserving the independence of Kuwait, or stopping the genocide in Yugoslavia? (Note: you're going to be tempted to say ""but they did those things *for the wrong reasons*"", and I'm going to say that that hardly makes a difference to the people who were helped).

First of all, just to set things straight: if you think NZ is on the 'pretty dang racist' end of the spectrum, you'll be in for a surprise if you ever visit Asian, African or Eastern European countries. NZ is a very multicultural country (well, the North Island at least) and most people seem to be all good with it.          
As for the 'why' - People like to generalise, that's how the human brain works.            
You notice patterns (or you *think* it's a pattern because of some cognitive bias) such as Chinese people speaking English with a certain accent. Some accents sound worse to your ears and you may be irritated by it... and boom, now you have a negative association with people who speak with that accent - who, in this example, tend to be Chinese. Your opinion of Chinese people is now slightly negative, and thus you will see other things they do in a more negative light. More things they do will annoy you from now on, which just reinforces your bad opinion about them.         
Add to this the fact that a lot of people like to blame others for their misfortune. People from a different ethnic background than you, due to some ancient instincts, will be labeled as 'others' or 'not my kin' more often than the race you grew up with. When you're looking for an enemy, it's much easier to pick the people with different skin colour, than your own people.

When one is framed as the other, for people who don't know the difference they can become confused, not being equipped with the knowledge to tell the difference.  

So, you may be technically right about the UCG not being unitarian, however, and you did ask for specifics,

Of special note are the links to Herbert and then Garner Ted Armstrong, as well as the links to United Church of God (wallet_man's affiliation) and Worldwide Church of God.

When you also state that they are not messianic (for I stated the same) you are absolutely correct.

Here are some beliefs from the wikipedia page of UCG that seem incompatible with Messianic Judaism:  
""Nontrinitarian belief, i.e., that the Holy Spirit is the spirit/power of God and of Christ Jesus rather than a separate person in the Godhead.  
God 'the Father' and Jesus Christ are viewed as two distinct beings in the 'God family,' united in purpose only.[14]  
Belief that Christians are begotten as children in the Family of God and will at their resurrection become  
""spirit-born divine beings who are part of Elohim, the universe-ruling family of God.""[15]  
Belief that the core of Jesus Christ's message was the coming of a literal earthly Kingdom and  
that people who are 'saved' will not go to heaven, but will live and rule eternally with Jesus Christ on earth after  
his second coming, and will subsequently share rulership over the entire universe as part of the 'God Family'.  
UCG also asserts that the final destination of the unrepentant wicked is not everlasting torture, but annihilation  
or permanent destruction.[16] Belief that people of Western European descent, primarily the original British colonies  
and the United States, are direct physical descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of the northern kingdom of ancient Israel,  
whereas the historical Jews (and modern-day Israel) are descendants of the ancient southern kingdom of Judah.  
This belief is not used to assert racial or ethnic superiority, but solely to interpret End Time prophecies  
which are believed to be directed at the United States and Europe.[17] Belief that people who do not know  
or understand the truth of the Bible during their lifetimes will be given time to learn these teachings  
after the ""Second Resurrection"" to a new physical life. After living again in the Millennial world under God's Kingdom,  
those who continue to reject God's Holy Spirit and way of life will be annihilated after  
the ""Third Resurrection"" along with unrepentant former believers who had turned away from God.  
They are destroyed in the third resurrection (the ""resurrection of fire"") in the Lake of Fire,  
along with Satan and his demons.[22]""»",True,False,0,1525225257,,False,0,dyaujzi,False,t3_7bt62w,True,t1_dyathtg,/r/messianic/comments/7bt62w/lets_crowdsource_a_sticky_post_explaining/dyaujzi/,,1526973263,1,False,True,False,messianic,t5_2sa0c,public

&gt; The Slovak nation and people had been poorly defined up to this point, as the Slovak people lacked a definitive border or national identity. However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to Magyarize the Slovak region under Hungarian control.
...
You left out important part of your cited source. The Slovak identity was not as collective and well defined as you implied it. Furthermore  a Hungarian or Slovak identity not always matched with actual ethnic background. If you thoroughly take a glance on the ethnic composition of key figures fighting in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 you will see a lot of similar ambiguity, which is no wonder because in mixed areas non-Magyars supported the revolution.  

Some people did not mind Magyar influence, some non-Magyars were even supportive of it.

 Sandor Petofi a revolutionary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 had Slovak origins still refused the invitation of Slovak nationalists, because he unconditionally thought of himself as a Hungarian and believed embracing this identity and culture could make Hungary strong and progressive.

The ~~Hapsburg~~ Habsburg monarchy did not look for friends, if that was the case they would have honored the minorities for their effort. They looked for allies(!), and since they could not solve their problem through the minorities, the minorities political capital evaporated.

&gt; &gt; nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe they would want to secede one day.

&gt; This is putting the ox before the cart.

It was a scenario that had chance to happen. They indeed could not predict it for sure, regardless history verifies them being right. 

I would use a different argument:

nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe it was not only the nationalistic sentiment, but the logic of the time as well to go with the magyarization policy as that was what the most progressive model dictated to be beneficial for the economy. If you take for example the most progressive parts of Europe UK, France and even Spain all of them imposed these policies for the same reason.

&gt;  **Also, isn't is funny that you're basically claiming that only Hungarians should assimilate other nations?**

This is pure chauvinism. It is not the fault of 2nd, 3rd or 4th and so on generations' of people what their ancestors did. In addition the time when forced magyarization happened was the era of nationalism and the peak of it. It happened to be the Hungarians were in position to impose rule over Hungary at that time. It was nothing but expected regulations were nationalistic as like I said both the sentiment and the economic model dictated so to be it. However once that was over it was the world of Wilson's fourteen points and human rights which made any sort of nationalist motivated revenge unjustified. But let's not get so far from Romanians, the Decree of Alba Iulia right in 1918 promised *Full national freedom for all the co-inhabiting peoples.*

False,firecracker42,,,,"&gt;Of course they were going to have German nobility ruling over them, essentially all of Europe had German nobility even during the First World War - the kings of Britain and Russia were Germans. 

There is a difference between being related to other countries kings, which is impossible for a monarch not to be, and literally having Hohenzollerns on your throne, and answering directly to the German crown.

&gt;But I assume you mean they were going to be German Satellites; Finland was free in all but name before the Treaty (it was not going to be a puppet as it was basically already an independent state), the Baltic States were to be ruled essentially as our satellites this is true, Ukraine was to be independent under German guidance, Crimea was to be heavily colonized by Germans granted but you must acknowledge the Volga Germans already present there and this is hardly a genocide, Belarusian culture actually flourished under our occupation and this was the first time in ages that they were encouraged to teach their language in their schools they’ll even tell you that they preferred us over the Russians. The only ‘breeding out’ would be in the Crimea and it was not in the way you would describe it. We would merely have encouraged Germans to emigrate there to develop a promising area of our empire (As a German I love Ukrainians btw). More on the Ukraine- the Entente even recognized them as a neutral state. They supported us economically yes and they were in our sphere of influence but they were an independent state showing their appreciation for their liberators and helping themselves and us economically with their trading of grain.

Yes, I mean puppet states, Finland was formed out of the February Revolution, a year before Brest-Litovsk. And much of Eastern Europe and the Crimea would've been subjected to the Drang Nach Osten, *this is undeniable that Germans, especially the German Empire's government thought of Slavs as lesser even before the Nazis did at those days.*

&gt; Elaß-Lothringen was German and still is today! The Rhine is not Frances natural border, the language and cultural barrier lays west of the Rhine and Elaß-Lothringen rightfully belongs to Germany, it was historically German and the people living there have always (of course not since the beginning of time but you understand) been German - never French. 

This was a doozy, in that case, Poland fully deserves Poznan, since even during the HRE they had it as Polish Lituania if you want to bring antiquated historical province claiming that's completely irrelevant, since french people do live in Alsace, and it's very clear they wish to stay in France.

&gt; I don’t know much about the Kashubians beyond them being West Slavs, however I know they are culturally more similar to us, the fact remains that the land was historically German and inhabited by a large number of Germans and the manner of our expulsion cannot be forgiven or forgotten nor should it. 

The times of the HRE and Polish Lituania prove this wrong that's it's always been historically German, hell going even farther back you can see Slavic tribes extended as far as Brandenburg.  Are you saying that the entente after fighting a war that killed millions of people shouldn't have weakened Germany as a punishment for siding with Austria Hungary on the ideas of declaring war on Serbia, after a rebel group disconnected to the government killed their arch duke and the government refused to be Austria Hungary's new goddamn province? You can't be serious can you, you sniveling imperialist!

&gt;The Versailles Diktat is an unforgivable humiliation inflicted upon the German people, it made the Second World War inevitable - we agreed to an armistice based on Wilson’s Fourteen Points and then they decide they’d rather strangle the most promising nation in the world in its youth, in the brief time the German Empire existed we accomplished more than any other nation did in their entire existence and I am proud that it took the whole world to bring us down- and that our enemies were without honor and dependent on treachery. It’s funny how the West complains about the might of Russia if they had let things be- we had neutered Russia and made a just order in Central and Eastern Europe. You are correct that I would agree with him on a few points -

Again, it's almost like weakening a nation you've just been at war with much like the North German Confederation did against France in 1871, is the point, to keep them weaker. I'm just upset you weren't weakened enough, and Germany, if it was not to be Balkanized after the First World War, 100 percent should've been after the second, with Belgium, Netherlands and France sharing the Rhein.  /s And, a massive possibly hostile in the future power is not much better than a massive currently hostile power.

&gt;however if I were alive at the time my demands would merely be; return to our 1914 borders, have France pay us reparations and occupy large swathes of their contemptible nation as we did in 1871 until they had learned their lesson. 

However if I were alive at the time my demands would merely be; return to our 1812 borders, have Germany pay us reparations and occupy large swathes of their contemptible nation as we did in 1807 until they had learned their lesson. See how stupid it sounds! So does yours! Why would Germany have Slavic lands of Poznan, again I have to say this. Why would France pay reparations for a war they won, against the aggressors that were the central powers?

&gt;I’d likely support a campaign to reestablish the Brest-Litovsk Treaty against the USSR. I honestly wouldn’t want Wilhelm back- he was incompetent. I’d prefer a figure head like grandfather on the throne, I believe Wilhelm’s son would be a good candidate. I’d prefer to see a military junta headed by the General Staff to lead us. 

The USSR needed the industrial and agricultural capabilities of the Ukraine, Poland and Belarus, at that time, today Russia can support itself but expect mass starvation and suffering if it was 1918 since no German empire or German military junta would trade with the Soviet Union especially since they no longer need to, they have their agriculture in the Ukraine already.

&gt;Anyways I disagree with Nazis on far too many things. 1) they are collectivists which I despise with a passion 2) their ideology hinges on us being the master race - there is not master race, race is only ever important when it is connected with culture. Cultures can be superior and inferior- all races are equal. 3) no people deserve extermination, especially not the Jews, the Jewish people helped establish the empire and the German people owe a great deal to their remarkable genius in their contributions to our greatness. 4) His fanaticism prevented victory. He could not set his Nazism aside. Had he prioritized the needs of the Wehrmacht instead of his stupid ideology, we may have won. 5) His rearmament program was unsustainable and forced him into a war that we were not yet prepared for. There are many other things but you get the idea I am not one of them and have nothing but contempt for the National Socialist movement, may Hitler rot in hell were he certainly resides. 

For number one, they where socialists and collectivists in name only. They, like Mussolini's Italy were capitalist and corporatist to the absolute maximum.  That's the point of fascism. I don't see much of a problem with 2 so we'll move on. For 3 even during the German empire there was still rampant antisemitism, Kaiser Wilhelm the second and August Von Mackensen are proof of this. For 4 and 5, In no situation could Hitler have won, unless maybe Lord Halifax before PM of the U.K. and signed peace when France capitulated. Even if they took Moscow their supply line was too stretched to continue.

Notably, this study does show a continuity between southern Scotland, Cumbria, and Northern Ireland. However, it loses the nuance in the original maps I saw; the North Leinster\-Ulster group had a significant presence through Ulster.

As for the comparison with Europe, I think you're right. The above study proves that England itself has an even larger divide than between NI and Ireland.

The UK's middle class income taxrate is also 1.5x of America's federal income tax (40% vs 25%). Germany isn't as bad but it's still noteworthily more.

&gt;  And yet, I bet most Americans would save money if they could trade their healthcare costs + insurance premiums to have EU tax rates. I'd love to see the numbers on that.

These numbers conflict depending on who collects* them. It's so polarizing the research manages to conflict depending on who you ask.

&gt; I mean, it's been shown, repeatedly, mathematically, that the US spends a retarded amount per capita on healthcare. Socialized countries spend less. Despite this, conservative America continues to claim that socializing ANYTHING makes it a massive convoluted bureaucratic quagmire that guzzles money and doesn't accomplish anything. One of these things is obviously incorrect.

Socialized countries also are much more prohibitive to innovation than the U.S's dynamic system is.

That said, if you want my -personal- opinion, it's this: When I have a private, (albeit nonprofit) healthcare insurer, if they do something I don't like the government can actually act as a 3rd party to rectify it if I get screwed. When the government is your insurer, you're screwed period. We got a $800 bill from the ambulance for my grandmother the other day because Medicare, a federal health insurer, decided that there services (basically saving her life when she had a heart attack) were only worth $400, not the $1,200 they charged. We're on the hook for the rest.

There's no (Accomplishable) appeal. You're screwed. You can't call your buddy Edgar and sue the federal government for your coverage. That's your reality under a medicare for all system.

There is this notion that people are only Marxists while they are in college and then they give it up afterwords, but also all the neomarxist college profs have totally distorted all of society somehow. 

Maybe second year comm majors think of themselves as Marxists but it frankly doesn’t matter until they are actually in the workplace and continuing to organize. I similarly don’t take anarchists and the whole antifa thing particularly seriously because it’s not more than a flash in the pan reaction, and possess no real intuitional existence nor deep organizational structure. College Marxists are just as likely to end up anarchists the next year, Neo-reactionaries the next, and then end on being Rawlsian liberals. When I’m referring to Marxists, as with all other political groups, I’m referring to it’s serious elements, and I don’t think there are many serious members of any political ideology who are undergrads. I suspect people who are now “Marxists” from being DSA members for a couple months because they like Chapo Trap House will give you a different answer. Hardened Marxist Leninist will not though. 


You are completely correct that Camus became quite unmarxist, Sartre is a bit more complicated but fair enough. The point is that in 1956 they were definitely both Marxists. And as Marxists they wrote very negatively about the Soviet Unions actions in Hungary. The damage that the Soviet invasion did to the world communist movement is hard to overstate, it is seen in retrospect as a major inflection point. Its after that when all these intellectuals start to drift away. Foucault is another example of somebody who was a Marxist in 56 but two decades later would be extremely critical of Marxism conceptually and the actually existing practice of communism. The British Communist Historians group is a good example of everybody staying communist but breaking alignments with any existing communist state. It would be Trotskyism which would be the overwhelmingly dominate tendency there to this very day. 


As for your last paragraph, something that needs to be understood is that many things look different for us now than to activists in the movement. In the moment communists saw China as a recently decolonized state which was helping other states which were colonized by Europeans throw their oppressors out. Across all these instances you always need to imagine as if you don’t know what is going to happen next historically in order to put yourself in the shoes of the people at the time.

False,Khamr,,,,"BTW how many Middle Easterners have you seen on here identifying as Asian? Zero. There is no conspiracy to group them with East Asian people. Middle Easterners are called Middle Eastern or British Arabs in the UK, not Asians.

Yemenis like Muhammad al-Houthi and Ali Abdullah Saleh cannot pass in Syria. they have distinctly Yemeni faces and darker skin tone. Some Yemenis have lighter skin but still their face structure is different from Syrians. 

Source: Myself. I've seen Yemeni faces in real life and they cannot pass for Syrians. And look at DNA charts of Middle Eastern ethnicities, Yemenis are on the opposite end of Syrians

Gulf Arabs look different from Yemenis and Syrians. 

Don't try to tell me a Yemeni can even pass as Italian. There is a gradual gradient shift, neighbors shift into each other, Syrians at the northern border will blend into Anatolians and Anatolians in western Turkey then blend into Greeks who then blend into Italians and so on, some Syrians can pass as other Mediterraneans because of this shift around the Mediterranean, but not a Gulf Arab or a Yemeni.

Syrians still have their own DNA mix which is different from Italians and Greeks so most still have their own Syrian looks. Only the Arabs of the Gulf countries are ethnic Arabs and they do not look like Italians. Syrian urban Sunnis are mixed with other ethnicities like Kurds who moved during Ayyubid rule unlike Alawites and Shia.

At the fringes, DNA is shared and passed on because people had lots of sex in the past. Bengalis have the most SEA Mongoloid DNA (20%) out of all South Asians, 

which is apparently shocking- 

NOT, because Bangladesh borders Southeast Asia where lots of Mongoloids live. Other North Indians have less Mongoloid DNA, like 5%. Its obvious why neighbors would share DNA with their neighbors.

Pashtuns and Pamiris live near Mongoloid ethnicities in Central Asia. So 2% of Northeast Asian Mongoloid in Pashtuns isn't surprising. The amount gradually decreases as you move more west, go to Iran and they have less, and generally none in the Arabized Middle East. If anyone has a small amount of Mongoloid in the Middle East its in Sunnis because of Sunni Turkmen migration from Central Asia and mixing in Seljuq times. Alawites would not have it. Partisangirl is a Sunni Syrian and she said her great grandfather was a Turkmen.

Using centimeters thick makeup covered Bollywood celebrities which misleadingly changes the appearance even their face structure  to represent South Asians and Central Asians is one of the most dishonest arguments people can make.

And we must tell Iranian women to stop getting nose jobs to look like Europeans, because apparently they already look identical to them according to you! They must be stupid getting all those nose jobs then if they look like white women? And tell me why I can identify Iranian women and some men by just looking at them, if they supposedly look like white women? Do I have amazing magical powers that can identify people's ethnicity by mind reading? No I don't, its because they have their own looks. They don't look like Arabs, Turks, or Europeans. And white men fetishize them.

Berbers are not Arabs, their DNA is different, they look physically different.

&gt;Scythians weren't an Iranian ethnic group. It was a generic term given to many ethnic groups by the Greeks. Scyth was basically the historic name for East Iranic. While they do share a language with the Pamiris, they were probably genetically closer to the people that live on those lands today and were genetically more European than the Pamiris. Most Pamiris have tan/light-brown skin and black hair. Red hair is very rare among them. Photos on the internet make them look whiter than they really are. They don't look too different to their neghbors who are Tajiks and Afghans.

Don't try to group people by cherrypicked internet photos spread by people with agendas or fetishes. Everyone loves to discover that mystery population of white people. And FYI people try to falsely pass pictures of Nuristanis or Kalash as Pashtuns.

There was a photo on internet forums of a blonde Uyghur girl in Turpan. Everyone must look like her, right?

Except Turpan is known for having the most black haired, Mongoloid Uyghurs IRL.

Southeast Asians also have different autosomal DNA from Northeast Asians. Burmese are mostly Bamarized native SEA so they don't look like East Asians. Thais don't look like East Asians, if you think they look East Asian, you've been seeing too many mixed Thais from Bangkok who have Chinese blood. Rural Thais from northern rural provinces in Isan and Chiangmai don't look East Asian in their facial features and their skin color is NATURAL dark, not just tanned or brown.

Many Filipinos you see can have Chinese ancestry because a lot of Chinese moved to Philippines and mixed with them. Almost all of them claim they have a Chinese great grandfather. Other Filipinos are much more natural dark skin and have SEA facial features.

A lot of Koreans generally have their own look and don't look like Chinese people. Kin Jong-un cannot pass as Chinese.

False,kieslowskifan,qualitycontributor,,Top Quality Contributor,"Not really. Sure, some of these MfS agents knew a lot of skeletons and details of domestic and foreign intelligence, but this really does not translate into something very tangible in terms of a security threat. For one thing, German unification and the wider collapse of the Warsaw Pact drastically altered the balance of power in Europe. Knowledge of NATO war plans against the Warsaw Pact or CIA agents in the GDR had less value when both the Pact and the GDR had ceased to exist. MfS agents were also adrift in that there was no large state entity or bureaucracy that could back them up. Some of these agents might have had knowledge of unsavory intelligence techniques, but they did not have the infrastructure to allow them to ply their trade after 1990. There were comparatively few safe harbors for MfS agents in the immediate post-Cold War world, a situation that was unlike 1945 where a number of SD and Gestapo veterans managed to find employment for the emerging Cold War throughout Western Europe. Added to this, the reunified German government also instituted the novelty of opening up the [MfS archives](https://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Archive/_node.html) which meant people had access to their Stasi files. The immediate period after reunification led to a wave of dismissals among civil servants for their roles as MfS informants. This denied the MfS veterans a potential lever for blackmailing former IMs since the files themselves were open. 

Finally, it needs to be stressed that the MfS, while certainly a formidable intelligence agency, was not some totalitarian leviathan. The mature MfS often recruited from within its ranks (fathers and sons for example) and social milieus. This meant that some of its agents were not the cream of GDR society. Its pervasive spying and surveillance often produced a morass of details that could never be analyzed.  Timothy Garton Ash's *The File*, an exploration of the author's MfS file while a student in the GDR, notes that there were tons of irrelevant details. Studies such as Gieske's or Mike Dennis's has shown that a lot of its personnel were devoted to the busywork of intelligence collection. MfS reports might note the curtains of Ash's flat, but the question of whether or not investigating this 20-year old British student was worth the MfS's time is not brought up. The MfS had proven fairly incapable of predicting or preventing the mass disturbances of 1989 despite its massive penetration into GDR society.

&gt; Silverstein is a 5-piece post-hardcore band from Burlington, Ontario, Canada; formed in 2000. The band name was taken from the famous children's author Shel Silverstein.

&gt; After several lineup changes, the band acquired Billy Hamilton, a local fan who learned of the band's need for a bassist on the Internet message board ""The 905 Board"" (an Ontario area outreach board which used to be for local musicians). In Christmas of 2001, he joined the band after Shane Told helped him learn the music for the songs. Following a rehearsal on Boxing Day (December 26) in 2001, he officially debuted with Silverstein. The next spring, original guitarist Richard McWalter left the band to move to Victoria, British Columbia to study engineering. He was then replaced by Neil Boshart, childhood friend of Shane Told. The new lineup recorded a second EP, When the Shadows Beam, in preparation for their first tour in Eastern Canada.

&gt; The band then signed to Victory Records in October of 2002 with a complete lineup as Hamilton attempted to complete his secondary education one semester early. The January after, the band recorded their full-length debut CD When Broken Is Easily Fixed, released on the Victory Records label.

&gt; In 2005 the band performed on the Never Sleep Again tour with bands such as Aiden, Hawthorne Heights and Bayside—a tour during which Bayside's drummer John ""Beatz"" Holohan would be killed. In January-February 2006, they toured with fellow Canadians Simple Plan in Europe. They then toured Canada with the Taste of Chaos Tour, and also toured Europe, Japan, and Australia.

&gt; The band toured on the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, in support of their current studio album Discovering the Waterfront and an EP compilation 18 Candles: The Early Years. The Early years compiles the band's first two self-financed EPs with some acoustic and live material as well as single remix of the Discovering The Waterfront hit Smile In Your Sleep. Discovering the Waterfront was re-released in September 2006 with an extra song, the band's cover of Lifetime's Rodeo Clown and a DVD.

&gt; In 2006, Silverstein was nominated for a Juno Award in the ""Best New Band"" category, but lost to Bedouin Soundclash.

&gt; In Fall 2006, they headlined The Never Shave Again Tour, along with Aiden, It Dies Today, and He Is Legend. Following completion of their third CD, the band played a few shows in the spring, and then engaged in an all-summer tour with Rise Against. The band toured the United States in Fall 2007 with From Autumn to Ashes and then went on a month-long European tour with Blessthefall.

&gt; Following tours of Australia and Japan in January 2008, the band played their first ""Cross-Canada"" headlining tour with Protest the Hero, Ill Scarlett and The Devil Wears Prada, which sold out across the country. They recently completed a U.S. tour with A Day To Remember, Protest the Hero and The Devil Wears Prada. Protest the Hero dropped off the Tour and Pierce the Veil took over for them on a few show dates. They completed a 2008 Europe tour in for May and June, including several festivals, and are playing a limited summer festival schedule.

&gt; In September 2012, the band had announced that Neil Boshart had been fired and would be replaced by Paul Marc Rousseau, who also joined Billy Hamilton on backing vocals. The band achieved moderate success with their second studio album, Discovering the Waterfront, which was nominated for a Juno Award and reached No. 34 on the Billboard 200 charts, with the following two albums charting at similar positions. Silverstein has sold over 1,000,000 albums worldwide.
The band left long-time record label, Victory Records, in 2010; and after a period with Hopeless Records are currently signed to Rise Records.

For Rey, she could be corrupted by the issue of her identity or something since the writers made her parents a red herring (so who IS she?). Also with her being a mary sue, why should she have to carry the resistance to victory when she can do pretty much everything, sort of a jab to the creators for making her what she is.

As for Kylo, he did idolize Anakin so finding his path to the light side would be a good homage for what Anakin did in RotJ. It could be played out that the resistance became even worse than the First Order due to corruption in the upper ranks (probably led by Rey) and those who chose to oppose it would have to settle their differences with former enemies and work together to beat this new threat.

False,OtterTenet,,,,"Problem One: PDF-FOR-RYAN.pdf ""Reexamining the Jewish Question"" - seems to be almost completely ignored in this video.

http://thealternativehypothesis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-FOR-RYAN.pdf

Mirror:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Bg5TZSwX4SfQ7BPEEUQc2Ap6RodYg2j

The PDF raises many points about the JQ that show that the current tendency moving in favorable directions. Less Jewish ethnocentrism, more alignment with whites on political issues, pendulum swinging back towards conservatism and right wing political views. 

The PDF omits from analysis facts like the recent collapse of the Socialists / Labor party in Israel - who lost 50% of their Parliamentary seats a decade earlier, and never recovered. The failure of the peace process with the Arabs, and the accompanying terrorism has resulted in a shift to the right. Secular Zionist Jews are at war against the Ex-Jewish Marxists in Europe and the USA. 

There is a reason Netanyahu keeps getting re-elected despite massive flow of funds from Soros into left-wing organizations.
https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-blames-Soros-for-Israel-anti-deportation-campaign-540640

These are two clearly distinguishable opposing factions that cannot be treated as a monolith group. This rift extends into the USA, and any analysis should recognize the differences. 

Problem Two:

What other religious and ethnic group survived in Christian Europe? Alt-Hype repeatedly claims that the Jews being chased away from every country is evidence of wrongdoing, yet fails to compare to any other group.

Europe during the middle ages and until the start of classic liberalism was almost entirely Christian, and with warfare between different branches. 

For example: When Russia adopted the Orthodox Christianity, the government persecuted and chased out any stubborn adherents of the old faith ""Starovertsy"". 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Believers

Mere differences in how they pray and in which sequence they perform the cross sign resulted in massive ""pogroms"" of the Old Believers, chasing the few survivors away from population centers. 

Western Europe was not much better considering the Catholic Inquisitors would terrorize the entire continent, burning anyone accused of heresy, and any Jew caught within their sphere of political influence who did not convert or adhere to very specific and strict restrictions. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition

The Spanish inquisition targeted any large group that could be suspected of disloyalty to the crown. 

This included the Jewish converts to Christianity: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Expulsion_of_Jews._Jewish_conversos

This included the Muslim converts:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos_and_Morisco_conversos

The main reason other faiths were not affected was simply because they did not exist in large numbers in Spain at the time. 

The reasons for the inquisition movements themselves are many, and they are largely not focused on the Jews. They seem a part of a general political struggle and warfare against Muslim and Ottoman empires, and against other branches of Christianity. 

Jews did not need to be nefarious or have a corrupting influence to result in an eventual expulsion - all they had to do was be a separate political entity that did not fit under the strict hierarchy demanded by the Theocratic State. 

The surprising fact is not that Jews were expelled from multiple Christian countries, but that they survived at all in such a hostile environment and without an empire to fall back on or return to like the Muslims or Turks. 

Problem Three: 

https://jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/

Alt-Hype knew about Jordan Peterson's response to the JQ, and decided to not to engage in that debate, despite an elaboration being posted on April 24, 2018, and provided statistical reference.

Alt-Hype could have included references to this rebuttal of Kevin MacDonalds that was linked by Peterson: 

https://philarchive.org/archive/COFJAA
____

I have to say I was not entirely surprised by the release of the video considering the overall trend of /pol/ and Youtube commentary in recent years - a downward spiral towards InfoWars level controlled opposition and blind acceptance of falsified research.

Why should Alt-Hype engage in an intellectual debate with key arguments and participants in the debate when he can pretend they do not exist, tabulate only the data that supports his favored position, and appease the more radical wing of supporters?

If the goal was honestly the preservation of Western and European culture, then the positive contributions of Jews to that culture throughout history and in the present would have been represented.

Focusing solely on the Jews that oppose your movement (with an obvious historical reason) completely ignores the existence of a growing minority of Jews that support western culture and reject the Marxists. 

For illustration, here are a few videos of European culture in the heart of Judaism, Israel:

Israeli Opera since 2000's has been staging some of the biggest productions of Western European classics. 

For example - Giuseppe Verdi's AIDA:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbMG7GwODk0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7cf0KMjzII

Giacomo Puccini's Tosca:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYR-uwyfLsY

Carmen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqWL9M3PUE

When you look at the deeds of these people, they are promoting Western Culture in the most direct way possible. They perform art in the classical tradition, keeping the culture alive and bringing it to new generations. 

If you ask the same people a political question unrelated to their direct profession, you may get a dumbass hypocritical and inconsiderate answer. They exist in their own bubble controlled by the same type of leftists news propaganda that became dominant in the USA. 

That reality of 1990's and 2000's is now slowly shifting back towards the right - politically at first, but now increasingly in the shifting media, and very rapidly on the internet. The leftists elites are not only losing in the USA, but also in a similar way in Israel.

There are only two groups of people interested in marginalizing this historical shift - Leftists ""Soros Shills"" who want to scare Jews away from a shift to the Right (""there be Nazis!""), and the kind of tactical profiteers within the Alt-Right that see competitive advantage in edginess.

In Japan, Shueisha (the publisher) holds the license to the series. The reason MHA figures aren't being made by anyone outside Banpresto (and formerly GSC, although it seems they lost the license), is almost definitely on the Shueisha end.

Licensing deals for Japanese toy companies don't go through Funimation. Funimation is based out of the US, and only licenses things for international distribution and production in the US, Canada, and parts of Europe. This means that Funko's license has no bearing on the production of MHA figures outside America, and likely wouldn't even have bearing on the production of MHA figures in America because they don't have a master license (which would grant them the exclusive right to MHA figures).

TLDR: This has nothing to do with Funimation or Funko, and everything to do with Shueisha.

Opinions have power, no matter what you do. The only option you have is to *change* that opinion. Like I said earlier, scientific studies have shown if you are confrontational about it, the people will become even more fervent.

&gt;lack of intelligence and education is the issue.

This is... generally incorrect. As a country, the US is ""tied"" for ninth in IQ alongside mostly European countries like Germany, so we do alright.

Lack of education is an interesting one. I think the way we educate the *young* in this country (which I think is what you were saying) is completely wrong. Lack of education wouldn't be as big of an issue if we at least taught them properly for k-12. Universities are a crapshoot based on which school you attend and your major. 

&gt;I am all for debating people with logic to prove a point but you can't convince someone who doesn't rely on logic.

This is where we disagree. You can! I have to do it all the time in my line of work. I'm a lawyer. I have to convince people to take settlements or plea deals they don't want to, normally for emotional reasons. If I just sat there and told them how logical the decision is, it wouldn't be nearly as effective. I also can't call them idiots for thinking about the other options etc. It takes a bit of diplomacy, but it's always worth it.

I wish both sides in the US were a little more diplomatic about their approach to these debates, it would go a long way towards opening up an honest rapport between everyone.

And like you said (btw, I don't mind your tone, it's fine), the internet has made things even more inflammatory. People feel much more comfortable slinging harsh insults with the relative anonymity of the web to protect them. Any dumbass with a youtube channel can spout inflammatory rhetoric to potentially millions of people.

Milchan, who then ran the family fertiliser company, never looked back, playing a central role in Israel's clandestine acquisition programme.

The same blueprints, belonging to the European uranium enrichment consortium, Urenco, were **stolen a second time by a Pakistani employee, Abdul Qadeer Khan**, who used them to found his country's enrichment programme and to set up a global nuclear smuggling business, **selling the design to Libya, North Korea and Iran.**

&gt; For that reason, Israel's centrifuges are near-identical to Iran's.

Not OP, but I've always found this kind of an odd stance for people to hold. Like, scientifically? Sure. Realistically? We all have a pretty good understanding of what these terms mean in terms of appearance most of the time. The idea that cops are unfairly targeting black men, for example, is predicated on the idea a ""black"" person can be easily distinguished from non-black people, which is generally true. 

&gt;Like, no one is telling you to not be attracted to some people or to be attracted to some others. What we're saying is that racial preferences aren't hard-wired into our brain because race is not really a meaningful way to categorize human beings. So the origin must be something else.

As for this, we are in some sense hardwired to prefer, feel more empathy towards, identify, etc. people of our ingroup. The fact that our most recent European iterations of what it means to be a ""group"" (race) aren't really very supported by science doesn't mean we haven't evolved over a gazillion years to prefer dealing with people who look, speak, think, believe, and act like we do.

Industry was stronger in the past, in the last decades we lost a lot of production plants both to efficiency and to offshoring (mainly to Eastern Europe, than China and India) but it is still going strong. Automotive, Aerospace, Metallurgy, Agrochemical and Petrochemical (particularly plastic polymers production) and Textiles are doing fairly well last time I checked. Farming and the food industry in general are also quite strong, with a focus on quality rather than quantity. Pharmaceuticals are doing somewhat good too. The financial sector is not a good place to work, if you ask me, but it is going strong in Milan, right along Fashion and Design, and tends to offer higher than average income.

&gt; Is there a place for a chemist there?

Definitely yes. I think Confidustria (a national confederation of most industries category associations) is actually complaining about the shortage of qualified personnel in some ""technical"" sectors and Chemistry is one of them. Expect an income that is lower than what you are used to (yes, this is probably the cause for the shortage in the first place).

&gt; What is the best place to work, socialize, and ski?

All three of them together? Probably Milan, Turin or some other northern city that is fairly close to the Alps and has ski clubs you can join. It really depends on how much weight you think the three elements should have, relative to each other.

&gt; Do ski slopes require tickets?

The slopes themselves rarely, but access to most lifts will require a ticket or a pass. I used to ski a lot in the three valleys of the [Monterosa Ski resort](https://www.dovesciare.it/sites/default/files/skimap-monterosaski_0.jpg) and they used this RFID plastic card you could ""recharge"" at the ticket booths for access to some or all the lifts, depending on which valleys/slopes you wanted to ski in and for how many days. The costlier pass is equivalent to 15 daily passes (to spend whenever you want all over the season) accessing all of the lifts in all three valleys and is around 490 euros. Food and beverages are not included: you'll find a lot of nice places to eat or drink a hot chocolate or a ""bombardino"" near the slopes or in the small towns in the valleys.

&gt; What are the skiing seasons?

Well, it depends. These last few years, the ski seasons have been shorter than normal but a few years ago I remember skiing on the Monterosa from the second week of December up to the second week of March.

The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of color, with some particular exceptions. Jewish people were to be exterminated in the Holocaust, along with Romani people, and the physically and mentally disabled According to the Generalplan Ost, the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder in the Holocaust, with a majority expelled to Asia and used as slave labor in the Reich.

All you've said is that you live in Europe, but your posting history includes Dutch so you're probably in the Netherlands or Belgium. It looks like anywhere in the region you're less than an hour away from a kite store.  

KiteLife forums have [a useful map](https://kitelife.com/forum/membermap/) of kite flyers around the world. Again assuming Netherlands, you might get in touch with their user SKS65 who seems active on the forums and might let you talk him in to trying out some gear.

&gt;  not too difficult to learn but still hard to master and something that doesn't pull too hard since I am kind of small. ... the prism synapse 170. I am not sure if a foil kite is a good idea for me though as I am kind of small and dont weigh alot.

Your other posts mention both the Synapse and the Symphony 1.8.

Both are good beginner kites. Both will have some pull, though. 

The Prism Synapse 170 is a beginner kite because it is durable and relatively easy to fly, but it is a speed foil so it is harder to control and has a pretty good tug. For some videos, I searched YouTube for ""Prism Synapse 170"" and found some good examples of the pull with [this video of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1eMLes0KG8) or [this review](https://youtu.be/ebKHLlzuXP0?t=67) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n364LanC2cE). I don't know how big you are with ""kind of small"", but if you're under about 60 kg a speed kite kite can pull you around at the field in gusts or in the middle of the wind window.

The Symphony is classed as a power kite, but is also a good beginner kite. I haven't flown it, but they look a little slower but with plenty of pull. Again, if you're under 60 kg you're likely to get pulled around the field, or at least get an upper body workout.

You might consider the smaller versions of each, the Synapse 140 or the Symphony 1.3. Both will have less pull, are durable, and both are rather fast.

&gt; a good amount of control over the kite ... a cool stunt kite of some sort ...  I don't live in an area close to the beach, so most of my training will be quite far landinwards, but am planning on bringing it with me when I go on vacation

Both the Synapse and the Symphony are fast. They'll meet your need for being durable, but they won't do the cool stunts.

If you're considering a sparred kite that is beginner friendly and slower than those two kites, and can do the ""cool stunts"", there is a kite called [the Beetle](http://intothewind.com/Item--i-7867) with a reputation of being nearly indestructible. The kite is slower, and under lighter winds it can do many of the beginner tricks like axels and fades and pancakes.

If you've studied European history you will know that a significant amount of Slavic communists were killed and put into concentration camps by the Nazis because Hitler saw slavic people as inferior and a free workforce. The SS were to hunt for communists and Jewish people. 

The fact that Jewish people emigrated to America and the west means they had more influence over the media and the stories we got to hear in the news, the books and memoirs that were created of their struggles whereas there was entire group of people (slavs) that were forgotten about and swept under the rug during the mayhem that was the Stalin-era.

False,Come_To_Brasil,,,,"&gt;Teríamos que achar um dispositivo para tirar todo esse encargo da classe média

Eu não sei até onde concordo com isso... A classe média já está, por definição, em uma posição financeira relativamente ""confortável"". Por mais que sua definição de classe média varie da minha, com certeza não estão passando necessidades básicas ou desabrigados. Portanto, na minha opinião, nós devemos sim focar nos que estão em situações mais desesperadas, sem residência e mal conseguindo se alimentar, que ainda são muitos no Brasil.

Sua definição desse ""encargo"" que cai na classe média difere da minha, eu acho, já que, se pensarmos em termos de impacto na qualidade de vida, os mais pobres são os que mais pagam o custo da nossa sociedade/economia, já que ocupam a posição (inerente ao capitalismo) da base da pirâmide, e, portanto, merecem maior apoio do Estado.

A não ser que você pense pela lógica (no mínimo, distorcida) de que quem é pobre é porque ""não fez por merecer"", ou não se esforçou o suficiente para ""subir na vida"". Aí realmente seria injusto a classe média ter que sustentar essas pessoas com seus impostos. Mas, como eu disse, a realidade não é essa, já que é simplesmente impossível uma sociedade capitalista sem os miseráveis, sem falar em toda a história das condições desiguais de competição etc etc etc.

Enfim, basicamente eu acho que o peso que recai sobre a classe média, por maior que seja, não chega perto do peso que é a miséria.

False,Lolkac,EURO,,Europe,"Data sources and availability


An unemployed person is defined by Eurostat, according to the guidelines of the International Labour Organization, as someone aged 15 to 74 without work during the reference week who is available to start work within the next two weeks and who has actively sought employment at some time during the last four weeks. The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.

In addition to the unemployment measures covered here, Eurostat also publishes statistics for persons who fulfil only partially the definition of unemployment. These persons are not included in the official ILO unemployment concept and have a varying degree of attachment to the labour market. The indicators on underemployment and potential additional labour force participants supplement the unemployment rate to provide a more complete picture of the labour market.

There is currently no specific legal basis for producing and disseminating monthly unemployment data. However, these monthly data are estimates based on results of the European Union Labour force survey (EU LFS), which is a continuous household survey carried out in all Member States in accordance with European legislation and on the basis of harmonised definitions. These results are interpolated/extrapolated to monthly data using national survey data and/or national monthly series on registered unemployment.

False,ZeroCorpse,,,,"First off, Paelleon wasn't too bad when he wasn't just being a standard Imperial sycophant. I like Thrawn, and Rukh was good, too. However, Zahn and Filoni have improved both of the latter two immensely in the new canon, so as far as I'm concerned the best two parts of the original Zahn trilogy was already incorporated into canon properly.

As for ""what Star Wars do (I) love?"" -- If you mean the EU, not a lot. Not love, anyway. I hate KotoR. The NJO was incredibly awful. The Yuuzhan Vong are horrid. Jaina ""Sword of the Jedi"" Solo and her dead brothers were all pretty terrible. Chewbacca's fate is pathetic. Kyle Katarn was two-dimensional. Most of the video games had weak plots and contrived characters that were ridiculously over-the-top because they had to serve as player proxies.

Most of the EU was fine when we didn't have any other Star Wars... And then the prequels, Clone Wars, and subsequent films and shows happened. 

So what Star Wars do I love? The canon Star Wars. The movies. The shows. The current crop of novels and comic books. The ones that aren't just fanfic that got a low-grade C-canon or S-canon in the old system. 

Lucas said it best:
&gt; *""There are two worlds here,"" explained Lucas. ""There's my world, which is the movies, and there's this other world that has been created, which I say is the parallel universe—the licensing world of the books, games and comic books. They don't intrude on my world, which is a select period of time, [but] they do intrude in between the movies. I don't get too involved in the parallel universe.""*

I see the Legends stuff as a parallel universe, or just a series of fictional tales told *in* the canon universe. It's material that contradicts itself constantly, and it seems like the EU writers spent an amazing amount of time trying to one-up each other, retcon each others' writing, and flatly ignoring other elements of the EU. 

Take for example Karen Traviss, who spent the better part of her time in the Legacy of the Force series doing seemingly *everything* she could to undermine the character development of other authors who wrote books in that series. It was supposed to be a series about the rise and fall of Darth Caedus, about how powerful Jacen had become, about Jaina's duty to end his reign of terror, and when it came time for Traviss' input into the series she spent the entire time promoting her Mandalorian characters and books (which were terrible and had Mandalorians all wrong, by the way), and doing everything in her power to make the Jedi and Sith look extremely weak in the face of run-of-the-mill Mandalorians. With her entry into the series, the whole story came crumbling down and hit a full stop... And this sort of thing was common in the EU. Every series had something like this happen. Every big series had one author playing against another author's ideas in what seemed like a competitive, messy, ""My book is better than your book"" kind of way, and it made the whole thing feel sour and unpleasant. Meanwhile, Traviss' contributions to the EU were so bad that George Lucas himself stepped in and had The Clone Wars retcon it all right out of existence. 

Compare that to the current canon. The Star Wars Story Group has tighter control, and doesn't let Karen Traviss situations happen. The stories all work *together* instead of against each other. 

So what do I love in Star Wars?  All nine main movies, Rogue One, Rebels, The Clone Wars, the new novels (including Zahn's excellent ""Thrawn"", which gives the character a lot more depth and development than the original Thrawn trilogy ever did), the new comics (especially Vader, which really does a great job with the character), and the things that are being gently and carefully guided by the Star Wars Story Group so that they don't end up with authors backstabbing each other in an attempt to make their pet character the most noticeable and powerful. 

I'm a fan. I'm actually a huge fan and have been since I was nearly 8 years old in that theater watching Star Wars-- the original Star Wars-- for the first time. I enjoyed having some Star Wars when there were no movies, but the EU books, games, and comics were all the wild west of Star Wars. There was no law. There was no guidance. There was also a lot of respect missing between creators.

I'm a fan of Star Wars; Not the unchecked fan fiction Expanded Universe that grew up in the absence of first-party materials. 

I cheered when they announced the EU was being shelved and that they'd mine it for good parts to inject back into canon. That was the best decision they ever made. They've done an excellent job pulling only the good stuff out of the EU and developing it in canon. They've done an even better job keeping the stuff that doesn't belong in Star Wars *out*.

O Neymar eu coloquei como exemplo para demonstrar que renda é renda.  Se um jogador de futebol, um executivo de alto escalão, ou um dono de empresa recebe, digamos, 1 milhão em um ano, não há porque diferenciar as taxas de impostos dos mesmos.  Ou seja, imposto de renda deve ser sobre a renda da pessoa, não importando se é salário, dividendos, ganhos de capital, etc.

Mas nos acabamos nos desviando muito do assunto da discussão inicial.  Meu ponto principal era que, se não fossem as distorções geradas pelo próprio governo, haveria pouca diferença entre empresas pequenas e empresas grandes.  Além disso, nas situações em que empresas grandes teriam sim uma vantagem, isso não é necessariamente ruim para a economia.  Sem a intervenção estatal, as empresas crescem até o tamanho de sua eficiencia, e isso é salutar para a sociedade.  É melhor ter, por exemplo, uma grande distribuidora de água potável, ou grandes fabricantes de automóveis do que uma infinidadede de pequenas empresas dessas áreas.

False,CaptnCheerio,,,,"&gt; Could these three all survive in healthy numbers based off the herbivores I listed? I don't think so. Large animals like camels would be needed for cats to maintain stable populations there.

What leads you to believe that? Is it just a gut instinct? It doesn't matter if there is only 1 species of prey animal as long as there is enough of that 1 species. Introducing camels would likely not have a significant impact on predator diet anyway because 95% of what a predator eats isn't large game. Camels are dangerous, cats know camels are dangerous, they're typically not going to go after them as long as there is a better option. Introducing a smaller animal would be more likely to impact big cat's diets.

I'm not necessarily opposed to reintroducing the dromedary camel, I don't know enough about it to feel strongly one way or the other. The point of what I'm saying is that the decline of the dromedary camel/Asiatic water buffalo isn't what lead to the decline in big cat species - it's hunting and habitat loss. So if one of the main arguments to reintroduce those animals is to provide a better food source for large cats, then that argument is almost null. 

&gt;Well, the wild Asiatic water buffalo is pretty endangered and concentrated in a single spot. Allowing predators to attack them would put the existence of their species' survival in jeopardy.

&gt;Is there any way to rewild domesticated buffaloes without mixing them? Like maybe back breeding them or something like how they're doing with the aurochs? Wouldn't it be easier to do it with domesticated buffaloes since they look almost identical to their wild cousins?    

Again, a primary part of your argument was to 'rewild' the Asiatic water buffalo to give large prey animals a food source. If we're actually working on conservation efforts to save the Asiatic water buffalo, rather than just try to come up with something similar from domestic stock (which isn't rewilding), then it's going to be a long time before those animals are populous enough to serve as a food source. 

Why would we be trying to create feral, which is the actual word you're looking for in this case - not rewilding, water buffalo that would only create competition for the actual wild water buffalo native to that area. It doesn't matter if they look similar, they've been domesticated for quite some time - they're not wild, any effort dedicated to this would be better spent trying to save the population of actual wild water buffalo in the area.


The auroch project is basically someone's science fair project. They're just scientists with grant money trying to bring back an extinct species. This isn't rewilding, this is 'de-extinction'. IF they are able to reintroduce them to areas, it's going to be the Yellowstone Wolf Project all over again. Aurochs, which seem to be described as 'fearsome', will have to live in a small controlled area. They won't ever be roaming the European countryside freely in herds. It's not possible considering the amount of growth Europe has seen since the 1600s when the auroch went extinct. Farmers don't want some ornery auroch bull busting their fences to breed their dairy cow. Hikers don't to get gored when they accidentally wander up on one. I'd say the chance of aurochs being successfully brought back and reintroduced is slim at best. 

Adding to that, here's a scientist weighing on back breeding:

&gt;“Back-breeding is a fairly crude way of developing an aurochslike animal,” says David MacHugh, a geneticist at University College Dublin.  

If they had a live auroch to work with, I'm sure they'd be all over breeding from that - but they don't so they're making do. We have wild Asiatic water buffalo, so why would it make sense to limit ourselves to back breeding from a domestic species?

&gt; Just looked that up. I'm pretty confused. Here is info on the incident: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mule-vs-mountain-lion/

&gt;The top of the link states the mule killed the cougar and the bottom says that it attacked an already dead cougar. Very interesting and surprising to me if it killed the cougar.

&gt;Do you know how common it is for cougars to interact with equines? Are they ever hunted by cougars?

I'm not talking about 1 link on the internet. I'm talking about first hand accounts of people who literally lived off the back of the horse and packed mules in the most remote area in the continental US for years. This was happening in the 2000's but they were out there living the 1800s. Mules are known to go after wolves, stand ground with grizzlies and lions. They're very different from a horse - and they get that personality from the donkey side of their genetics. 

Lions and horses definitely interact. Lions will kill horses, obviously only the domesticated horses are getting reported as 'killed by lion' but they seem to go after older or smaller horses that are being kept by themselves or with one other horse in a paddock. There is definitely safety in numbers. Wildlife Management Officials describe attacks on horses as 'very rare'. 

Going back to my back country ranger friends, they kept large herds of horses on free range in mountain lion territory and never lost one to a lion.

&gt; If domesticated horses are well adapted, then how come European rewilding projects are trying to breed them back like how they are doing with the aurochs?

That is someone's science fair project. They're doing it because they want to, it doesn't have anything to do with the ability of our modern domesticated horse to adapt. They can't create a wild horse anyway, because there are no truly wild horses left in the world - they all broke off from a domestic ancestor. I'm sure they could have turned Icelandic horses loose in Poland and had the same result, but they wanted to try to recreate the Tarpan.

Depression is on the rise, and 75 percent of all new cases are female, suicide is on the rise (the majority of attempts are female), single motherhood has skyrocketed and the majority of rapists and woman beaters are the products of single mothers, the ""feminist"" government of Sweden has said the rise in rape reports is a good thing because theyre being reported, the birth rate is dropping like a rock, promiscuity and STD's are on the rise, and the hook up culture has put society in this weird sex-obsessed yet sex-deprived state with all of the negatives but no benefits

Feminism for the past few years has NOT been about equality, its been about special treatment. Lower standards for the same jobs in the military, extended test times for women at Oxford in math exams, pushing for economic equality when men make up the majority of workplace deaths and applicants for higher paying jobs (especially in the tech industry), and telling women that theyre beautiful and amazing and any guy who says otherwise is an asshole even if they're 200lbs and have kids. 

Feminists love to criticize the west but refuse to criticize cultures like, and especially, Islam. The majority of Islamic converts in Europe have been women, marrying a muslim man who probably has other wives. The sad truth is that women and men arent the same and to pretend they are has had so many negative repercussions. The obvious fact is women are more easily manipulated through force and coercion, but when given power, they are less fair and more oppressive. The long history of female oppression shouldn't be forgotten, because it was awful and thats why we got here in the first place. but people need to respect the animal that is man and try to fit with nature, not pretend were something better than we are

A move which would likely do more damage to wildlife, do lasting damage to the land both chemically (e.g. poured concrete) and aesthetically as well as increasing the cost of of food both to the consumer and the farmer.

&gt;or start raising dogs with their livestock

So they should have to invest time and money into a dog that would have to fight the wolves, likely leading to an injury of both animals? The farmer would then have to pay for the vet bills and the wolf will likely die in the wild anyway because of it's injuries.

&gt;I would find shooting wolves acceptable if their population was out of control

I agree that it is a shame that this one was shot but I would argue that one of the main reasons wolves went extinct in that area (and most of Europe) is because of their incompatibility with agriculture, and the lack of remaining wild land. Having any number of wolves roam freely around agricultural land is, by definition, a population out of control.

Again it's easy to dictate to people what they should have to live with when you're not experiencing it yourself and, whilst I agree we need to make a concerted effort to protect species from extinction, we need to find a solution that allows the animals enough natural land to exist without infringing upon humans.
