Likewise, Asians in general have eschewed the European suit and tie for the Neru collar style of India, for a long time. And again, at one points you couldn't move for Neru suits.

If people don't *see* an incentive, which is what i said, then there is no reason for them to work. Why/how would someone see an incentive to work If their government aid goes farther than an entry level job would, or if going off assistance is simply more expensive and results in a reduction to their quality of life ?

&gt;How much do people in California receive from the ""nanny state"" and what impact does this have on housing costs? 

Probably above my pay grade. As far as I know (living in CA for 9 yrs), the rent prices are just absurdly high out here, and that is one of the reasons *why* CA spends so much on welfare. That is my understanding of the relationship between housing costs and welfare spending in CA.

&gt;How does welfare increase income inequality?

You could Google it. An excerpt from a 2015 European Central Bank report:

&gt;multilevel cross-country regressions show that the degree of welfare state spending across countries is
negatively correlated with household net wealth. These findings suggest that social services provided by the state are substitutes for private wealth accumulation and partly explain observed differences in levels of household net wealth across European countries. In particular,
the effect of substitution relative to net wealth decreases with growing wealth levels. This implies that an increase in welfare state spending goes along with an increase - rather than a decrease - of observed wealth inequality.",True,False,0,1525133656,,False,0,dy8pdsv,False,t3_8g00nd,False,t1_dy8mzll,/r/conspiracy/comments/8g00nd/la_has_criminalized_poverty_by_making_it_illegal/dy8pdsv/,,1526930036,20,False,True,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,public,

First up is the *moehau*, which is purported to be either a large, humanoid creature or a race of people living in the forests primarily in the Coromandel Range in the North Island. It could be related to or be a descendant of the *maero*, another humanoid creature said to have inhabited New Zealand before the arrival of Maori. Sizes range up to about seven feet tall. Outside of the Coromandel Range, reports have come mainly from the West Coast region of the South Island, where a tall hairy humanoid has been observed stealing vegetables from people's gardens or scaring campers out by throwing rocks and screaming at them. 

Moa have become ""cryptids"" in the sense that people have claimed to see them despite the birds going extinct at least two hundred years before the first known Europeans arrived. Moa are most famous for being massive birds, but there were numerous species where birds were about a fifth of the size of the largest species, and some lived in areas where humans generally did not go. Moa have mostly been reported from the Southern Alps in the South Island, where some of the largest tracts of pre\-European forest remain untouched. Stories range from a fisherman seeing multiple birds crossing slip faces in Fiordland to a train driver almost running over what he thought were sheep, but turned out to be large, flightless birds. 

Another one that not many people in New Zealand know about is the *waitoreke*, a mammal said to be about the size of a cat which has been attributed to animal sightings and footprints that resemble that of an otter, as well as the discovery of dams similar in construction to those made by beavers. The first documented sighting was made from Captain James Cook's ship the *Endeavour* in Dusky Sound in Fiordland. German geologist Julius von Haast, who explored the South Island in the middle of the 19th century, claimed to have found footprints of the *waitoreke* as well as a pelt of one, with similar coloring to the eastern quoll, a small mammal found in Australia. If it does exist, it would be significant discovery as New Zealand was devoid of land\-dwelling mammals for millennia, save for some species of bats and pinnipeds along the coast. 

New Zealand's Area 51, or some sort of secretive facility, is the Waihopai Station located on the northeast of the South Island near the town of Blenheim in the Marlborough region. Construction began in 1987 and it became operational in 1989. Not much about it is known, but it's not particularly well hidden, as a bunch of opponents to it cut through the fence surrounding the station and sliced open the radomes with a sickle. There is also another facility called  Tangimoana Station which is located 30 kilometres west of Palmerston North in the North Island. It's nowhere near as well known as Waihopai.

Pushing spay/neuter at every opportunity is sort of their bread and butter, so I don't fault them too hard.

&gt; Neutered male dogs are notoriously aggressive against intact, probably because they have never encountered another intact adult male

That makes me wonder.  Do neutered males in places like Europe where spay/neuter isn't so universal still react the same way?

False,[deleted],,,,"  At various points in history, we did have multiple species of humans.  They just got out-competed and went extinct.  The most recent episode took place around 25,000 years ago.  

Neanderthal man was a human species which occupied Europe.  Cro-magnon man (aka anatomically modern humans) occupied Africa.  As long as both species lived on separate continents, there was no problem.  It was easy for each species to breed in isolation and adapt to living in different environments.  Eventually, however, Cro-magnon humans spread out of Africa and displaced the Neanderthal.

We don’t really know why this happened.  Climate change might have made the environment more favorable to Cro-magnon and less favorable to Neanderthal.  Cro-magnon was probably also smarter and more adaptable than Neanderthal, so they were better able to compete and use technology to their advantage.  Some have suggested that Cro-magnon may have brought African diseases that Neanderthal was vulnerable to.  There is at least one anthropologist who thinks Cro-magnon had an advantage in hunting efficiency because he domesticated wolves while Neanderthal did not.  It could have been any - or all - of these things.  

The jury is still out on whether Cro-magnon ever interbred with Neanderthal.  Some people think evidence supports the idea.  However, even if they did interbreed it was not widespread.  The hybrid species may even have been sterile, like mules, and in any event their genetic line did not survive even in hybridized form.

Yeah, I suppose there isn’t very much *only* he could do, but I imagine he would lead congress by a very conservative example. One thing he could directly touch is nominating Federal and Supreme Court Justices that would overturn decisions related to civil liberties of the LGBT community and reproductive rights.  I’m not sure how you feel about immigration or the transgender rights, but I imagine a unified Pence administration would probably be considerably more successful than Trump attempts at the travel ban and the trans armed forces ban.

I think more importantly than any of that (and this refers to your second question as well) is the rhetoric. Under normal circumstances, regardless of politics, the voice of the President is an important one. If a sitting president openly considers 10-15% Godless perverts, I think that could significantly harm our voice on a global scale and the values we hold as a country.  His ability to demonize an entire category of people is dangerous weapon that i would hate for the leader of the free world to hold. 

&gt; Who exactly in the Democratic party offers a centrist economic policy?

That really depends what you mean. I would consider free trade to be classically liberal position held by modern conservatives, while Trump’s protectionist views seem to be more closely aligned with the Bernies of our current political environment. Regarding domestic policy, I imagine that someone like Biden or Cory Booker might toe the line more than Bernie or Elizabeth Warren would.

I mean, Perfume did tour within Asia a few years back (I remembered it was somewhere in Singapore and Taiwan, pardon me if I'm wrong as I haven't been following their past world tours). Do they not want to be internationally popular? They already are a household name as the top techno pop girl group in Japan, so I'm not sure why they shouldn't take the next step further?

The only reasons I can think of are probably due to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the focus on the US market. My guess is that even if they do have a World Tour, it'll probably be all in the US (Just looking at Babymetal's ""World Tour"" would be an indication of how Amuse would handle this). I understand that the US is the largest market right behind Japan, but what about Europe? Australia? Or even their home turf, Asia? 

You didn't have to feel guilty man, you should be happy to see them! I've already had plans to go to Japan for a long time to experience Japan and its culture and lifestyle, but not for a Japanese artist's concert.

Re: Germany - It depends on whether their current economic boom continues, and, in the case of a downturn, how the different political parties position themselves.

 Merkel ran on Germany's strong economy and (historically unmatched) financial security in the October 2017 elections. However, since that's taken for granted, the election became a referendum on cultural and ideological issues. As many SPD as CDU/CSU voters defected to the AfD over migration and *Leitkultur*; as many or more CDU/CSU voters defected to the FDP since Merkel wasn't fiscally conservative enough (Eurozone bailouts, etc.). Most voters didn't seem to want anything tangible out of the election, insofar as impact on their everyday lives was concerned. Like, AfD voters basically want to kick out Muslims and introduce *Leitkultur*, but no one can agree on what that even means, and most of them don't live in areas that have migrants in substantial numbers.  Voters who want stricter fiscal conservatism (a.k.a. being harder on Greece and welfare recipients) morally object to their dollars going unseen to the lazy. Both groups believe they are victims - of refugees, the EU, etc. Since it was an election about culture and ideology (and vague notions of national victimhood), the SPD's proposals for eliminating kindergarten fees and making the health care system more equitable fell on deaf ears. So, it was sort of like the US 2000 and 2016 elections in that regard.

I'm not so worried about the AfD becoming a governing party in the near future. In part, that's because the AfD is deeply divided between those who want to govern someday (who are splitting off), and those who are only interested in being a disruptive force in the Bundestag. In part, that's because Merkel (and new interior minister Seehofer) are implementing more restrictive and/or punitive migration (and deportation) policies. The big question is who succeeds Merkel as leader of the CDU, and whether it will be someone (like Jens Spahn) who's a cultural hardliner and wants to woo AfD voters (possibly in vain.) A failed push in that direction, abandoning the center ground, is one of the few scenarios in which an SPD chancellor is possible - if they're smart enough to try to reclaim the center. Merkel made Spahn health minister in order to destroy his political career, since anyone trying to reform the health system will become unpopular. She made the more moderate, pro-European, culturally moderate Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer General Secretary of the CDU, a less politically hazardous position that would position her to become the next *Kanzlerkandidatin*.

Language death in the modern era is often a symptom of colonization or the imposition of a dominant or 'metropolitan' culture on an indigenous culture, and of the latter's needs being ignored or unaddressed. In many cases, reducing the number of languages spoken worldwide doesn't remedy this pathology, and in fact can inhibit or restrict access to cultural wealth. The [Linguistic Society of America](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/endangered-languages) and [*Smithsonian* Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/four-things-happen-when-language-dies-and-one-thing-you-can-do-help-180962188/) both have pretty solid articles explaining this in detail.

I live in the state of New Mexico and have done so for most of my life—I grew up in Farmington near the Navajo Nation, and now I go to university in Albuquerque, which before European contact was inhabited by communities that spoke the Navajo, Apache, Keres and Tanoan-Kiowa and Keresan languages. Many of the reservations in New Mexico have third-world living conditions such as no running water, no electricity and uranium mining contamination, and the cultures are struggling to survive in an environment that emphasizes fluency in English and (occasionally) Spanish. One of my colleagues feels like he doesn't belong in his own heritage because he's been denied opportunities to learn Keres like his ancestors did. My partner knows exactly why his father never taught him Spanish and his mother never taught him Navajo—becaise if he spoke a language other than English it would hurt his chances of success in the long run.",True,False,0,1525151089,,False,0,dy9516a,False,t3_8fzu1l,True,t1_dy87cpf,/r/linguistics/comments/8fzu1l/what_have_been_some_of_the_worst_linguistic/dy9516a/,,1526938966,3,False,True,False,linguistics,t5_2qhos,public,

False,kristynaZ,CZEC,,Czech Republic,"&gt; You equal law infridgements with rejecting the principles of the EU. This is not the same.

It's exactly the same. The refugee quotas are a binding EU directive, not a core EU value. You cannot trigger Article 7 over the refugee quotas. The refugee quotas aren't any different from the legal perspective than any other directive that Germany is breaking. The fact that you selectively pick exactly this issue to rant about EE speaks about your own bias.

We are not going against the EU 'whenever we can'. We are having a disagreement about one directive. Quotas aren't even the only way to support SE. You can reject quotas and still support SE in other ways.

&gt; What is ""everything we had to give""? The things you had to give have mainly to do with capitalism, not with the EU. Don't mix those things up.

Oh, so I can't mix any econonomic or demographic side-results of the EU membership in this, but you keep saying how it's acceptable to mix structural funds with immigration. So some things can be mixed but others can't?

&gt; Just the EE countries work against it wherever they can and this cannot be unpunished.

What are we doing speficially that is against the EU? What is my country, or Slovakia or the Baltics or Slovenia doing against the EU? Why should we all be targeted?

&gt; The budget means that Germany will have to give money. 

Everyone will have to give more money to fill the gap of Brexit, otherwise there will be a smaller budget - that's quite obvious and we are perfectly aware of that.

&gt; nd EE countries are not exactly in a position to demand anything in those negotiations, because if Germany refuses to give money, there is no budget. If we have no budget, EE countries will get no funding at all.

If there is no budget, then EE countries also don't have to pay in anything. My country has gotten richer and so it wouldn't qualify for nearly as much funding as before even if the GDP PPP was still the only criterion. If other criteria are considered like the unemployment (we have the lowest in the EU) or number of refugees (we have a very few of those) then we would likely receive very little money anyway. Thus you can't really threaten us with 'you won't get any funding if the budget isn't approved' when the proposed budget already cuts our money anyway.

False,redditor_85,,,,"Hm...then are you suggesting the US becomes a welfare state like some European countries where the government gives handouts to people out of jobs?

Edit: I'll add some more here since you edited your response. I understand your perspective where you believe that an immigrant takes away a job or handout that could go to a citizen. Conceptually, it makes sense, but could you explain what the immigrant exactly takes away? I don't think I understand that because the National Academy of Sciences issued a report on immigration in 2016 that stated the willingness of less-skilled immigrants to work at low pay reduced consumption costs — the costs to consumers of goods and services like health care, child care, food preparation, house cleaning, repair and construction — for millions of Americans. I know, it doesn't make sense, right? But that's what their study found.

That's not saying that immigration has all positive effects on Americans. That same study found that immigration has a negative effect on low-income natives by lowering wages in low-income jobs. Immigrant labor mostly benefits owners of capital rather than the ""working man.""

The study also found that first-generation immigrants cost $1,600 each to local and state budgets. But, the second and third-generation of those immigrants add a net-positive of $1,700 and $1,300 respectively. So the immigrants actually end up contributing more than their ""fair share.""

Immigration in general has a positive effect on the American economy. It doesn't help or hurt native-born Americans equally - it is very complex. You pointed out that people are out of work or in need of assistance in the US. Could it be possible that those are symptoms of a problem unrelated to immigration? For example, companies are seeing record-breaking profits and yet, the average wage hasn't increased at the same pace. Instead of companies choosing to increase worker's wages from their profits, that money is going to shareholders.",True,False,0,1525163603,,1525166419,0,dy9bak0,False,t3_8g6q5g,True,t1_dy9b7ke,/r/AskReddit/comments/8g6q5g/why_should_or_shouldnt_we_give_citizenship_to/dy9bak0/,,1526942466,3,False,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,

We take in very few refugees. Especially compared to our colonial role, let alone compared to our role in destabilising the middle east.

The ""problem"" for the EU persists after Brexit regardless -- no deal does not create border infrastructure (someone has to actually build it first) so they end up with the worst of all scenarios: a porous customs border and the UK not giving a rat's arse about the EU's customs union integrity as there's no deal anyway.

You realize that building a border is not such a monumental deal as you make it right? the EU has way bigger and more complicated borders.

&gt;and the UK wakes up on Mar 30 to a world in which the question of whether they want a withdrawal agreement evaporates and any question of regulatory demands by the EU over the UK are gone.

And so are the trade deals with literally the entire rest of the world. 
Besides you guys continue to assume a level of equality that just does not exist.

Most country in the world could afford cutting the UK from their trades.
Pretty much nobody can hope to cut the EU from their trades and not have a third world level economy.
and you are there trying to devise brilliant plans to not only abandon the EU, but to assume a hostile position towards it?

The EU does not want a no deal because... why would they? But don't confuse making smart decisions with leverage, you have no leverage whatsoever, no cards to play.

Erm... [only when they look like this](https://previews.123rf.com/images/upperkase/upperkase1306/upperkase130600048/20478794-shipping-container-on-articulated-trailer-and-lorry-on-uk-motorway.jpg). Most of the time they don't have containers on them when they're using ferrys or roads.

&gt;It is simply not a feasible facility for Northern Irish roads (where do you put them that people don't just drive a different way)

You put them on the main crossing points, smaller roads are low risk due to less goods traffic, but can easily be monitored by ANPR (say for a high volume of goods vehicles crossing, or one car making lots of journeys ect.), as lots of roads in the UK are anyway.

&gt;doesn't even address the problem the EU's actually worried about, and nobody has any interest in making it feasible.

Then pick 3 pictures circa 2013-2014 of the very beginnings of the migrant invasion into Italy, Germany, Paris, the UK, Sweden, etc, where we saw the same ""we love migrants"" groupies handing out water and giving out hugs to crowds of a similar size starting to cross into Europe... pictures which we all know looking back 5 years later represented the beginnings of the end of Europe.  Now be completely honest and tell me truthfully, if we laid out the 3 pictures from Europe 2013-2014 and the 3 pictures from our border today side by side, would you be able to tell that the pictures were taken years apart?  Would you know that the pictures were taken thousands and thousands of miles apart?  Would you even think for a second that the pictures weren't all taken at one event and not over multiple years across multiple countries?  I'm being dead serious here.  Because I can't tell the difference.  And this is what scares me.  This is EXACTLY what I saw happen in Europe at first.  Smaller numbers like this, welcoming crowds, water being passed out, chants of ""we will take your country for ours"", flags the countries the invaders came from being waved around.  People claiming to be refugee's or ""migrants fleeing poverty"" with iphones.  And then I remember how the event repeated itself over and over as the european populace sat back and let itself get destroyed until some started fighting back after they realized they were being invaded but by then it was too late.  I remember the sky rocketing number of terror attacks, acid attacks, crimes against children and unspeakable atrocities we all know about and hear about with regularity now that I won't go into for the sake of those who can't stomach hearing about it anymore.

How many did we just let slip into the country who support ISIS or whatever offshoot they call themselves now?  How many terrorists did we just let into our country today.  And how many attacks (god forbid) in the future will we trace to people who came across the southern border today, because if you watch intel congressional hearings with the military and with our wonderful patriotic men and women keeping us safe... they've testified that the radicals, that the ISIS's that the al quaeda's and etc's have all been propogating plans to get into the usa via southern border hoping by sneaking in with the illegals that regularly come through and across.  I'm truly concerned, I know our president is too, and I'm furious at the groups that encouraged this illegal behavior, at the governments that funded these caravans, and anyone who was complicit in instructing these people on how to cross and claim asylum, anyone who gave instruction, worked with these criminals, and in any way abedded the law breaking at our southern border, should be thrown in prison.

&gt; 
&gt; Please do correct my mistakes

Will do!

1. You got the vowel length wrong in seven out of 68 words. You spelled [*ān*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/an#Old_English) with a short *a*, [*drēamlīċ*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/007872) with a short *i*, [*blōma*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bloma#Old_English) with a short *o*, [*þȳ*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEy) with a short *y*, [*dēor*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deor#Old_English) with a short *e*, [*milde*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/milde#Old_English) with a long *e*, and [*hwā*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hwa) with a short *a*. You need to start memorizing vowel length with each word. That shouldn't be hard—for me it's automatic—as long as you sound out how words are pronounced in your head.
2. You keep mixing up when *c*, *sc*, and *g* are [palatalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Old_English#Palatalization) (that is, when they're pronounced [/t͡ʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate), [/ʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative), and [/j/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant) respectively). The words [*Englisċ*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Englisc), [*sċulan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan), [*fæġernes*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/f%C3%A6gernes), [*ġecnāwan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gecnawan), [*ċearu*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cearu), [*herġan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herian), and [*ġesēon*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geseon) should all be palatalized. This should also be memorized along with each word, since it's part of how they're pronounced. Protip: *sc* is palatalized in every common word except for [*āscian*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ascian#Old_English) ('to ask'), which is usually *āxian* anyway.
3. You keep ending the infinitives with -en. Old English never had a standard spelling system like modern languages, but the vast majority of the time, scribes would end infinitives with -an.
4. 'āblysan' and 'þoteran' aren't words. You're thinking of [*āblysian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/037370) ('to blush') and [*þoterian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/031964) ('to wail'). It's actually really important to remember which verbs end in -ian, because they're inflected differently from all other verbs. There are also a lot of them.
5. You keep inflecting infinitives. You write '[hīe] sculon willaþ' twice, when it should be *[hīe] sċulon willan* ('[they] should want'). This is one of the most common mistakes language learners make. Your brain is like, 'We just inflected one verb, why not this one?' I still do it as a German student, though not anymore with Old English, which I'm better at.
6. The normal plural of [*weald*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/034746) ('forest') is *wealdas*, not 'walda'.
7. [*dōmian*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/007812) is an exotic word; I'm not sure I've ever seen it before. The most common word for 'to praise' *herġan*, though it wouldn't be weird to see *lofian* either.
8. You keep using [*sċulan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan) and [*willan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/willan) to indicate the future. Those words were occasionally used that way in Old English, but normally *sċulan* means 'must' or 'should' and *willan* means 'to want', like with their German cognates [*sollen*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sollen#German) and [*wollen*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wollen#German). You see, Old English doesn't really have a future tense; what's called the 'present tense' is really just the 'non-past tense', and you use it for both the present and the future. That may seem primitive, but lots of modern languages don't have separate future tenses either, like Finnish, Chinese, and Swiss German. Surprisingly enough, it's never caused me trouble. 99% of the time, either contextual clues show you whether someone's talking about the future, or it doesn't matter. If you want to know more, you can read [this](http://cla-acl.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cowper_Hall_Bjorkman_Tollan_Banerjee-2015.pdf). 
9. Your sentence 'Híe sculon willa[n] þæt híe hæfdon þíne fægernesse gecnéowen' ('They shall wish that they had known your beauty') is interesting because it has one particular error that's subtle and rarely discussed. An Old English writer probably wouldn't say 'hæfdon ġecnāwen' for 'had known'. Though the present tense of 'have' was often used to form past participles, 'had' wasn't usually used for pluperfects. If you wanted to specify that an action had already been completed in the past, you'd just use the word [*ǣr*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A6r#Old_English) ('before'): *Hīe ǣr cūðon* 'they had known', literally 'they before knew'. Also the past participle of *ġecnāwan* is *ġecnāwen*, not 'ġecnēowen'.
10. One of your sentences reads 'animals *willaþ tō cunnenne* your gentle touch'. An Old English speaker would just say *willaþ cunnan* ('want to know'). *Willan* is a [modal verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb), so you follow it with a bare infinitive, without the word 'to'. Its modern English descendant is the same way: you'd say 'I will watch a movie', not 'I will to watch a movie'. If you're wondering, the other modal verbs in Old English are [*cunnan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cunnan) ('know how to'), [*durran*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/durran) ('dare to'), [*magan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magan#Old_English) ('can'), [*mōtan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motan#Old_English) ('may/must'), [sċulan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan#Old_English) ('should', 'have to'), and [þurfan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%BEurfan) ('need to'). There are also some verbs that can be used with or without *tō* completely interchangeably, like [*onġinnan*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onginnan) (the most common word for 'to try' and 'to begin'). *Iċ ongann þæt hūs tō forlǣtenne, ac mīn hund ongann mē forbēodan* ('I started to leave the house, but my dog tried to stop me') is a completely correct sentence.
11. The word *strēam* doesn't usually mean 'river'. The most common word for river is [*ēa*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ea#Old_English).
12. 'Eall sceal dómae þé, hwa wæs'—Aside from the ones I've already pointed out, this has a couple interesting errors. First, the word *eall* in Old English works very much like in modern English: it means 'everything' when it's singular (*eall is gōd* 'all is well'), and 'everyone' when it's plural (*ealle sind wilcuman* 'all are welcome'). Second, the hw- words aren't used for relative clauses in Old English. Instead, you use [*þe*](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/031544) or one of the words for 'that': *Iċ hæbbe þæt þū wilt* ('I have what you want'), *Þæt is se wer þe mē liccode* ('That's the man who licked me'), *Ġelǣrede menn on Europe wiston þǣre Eorðan sinuwealtnesse hūru sīþ þām Crēcisċan ūþwitan Platōn, se lifde fēower ældum ǣr Criste* ('Educated people in Europe have known the Earth was round at least since the Greek philosopher Plato, who lived four centuries before Christ').
13. You got the inflections of nouns and adjectives wrong a few times. Even the title, 'An Englisce Lēoþ', should be *Ān Englisċ Lēoþ*. I don't know if you're erring here because you don't understand the case system (very common for a beginner!) or because you didn't look up the right inflections, or both.

Correcting your mistakes and substituting a few words, this is how I would render your lēoþ:

*Wealdas cunnon þīnne naman, Kelān. Hīe wȳsċaþ þæt hīe þīne fæġernesse cūðen—sēftu fōtswaðu, drēamlīċe stefne. Wind singþ þē sārlēoþ and lofsangas. Blōman āblysiaþ for þām þe hīe þē ġesǣgon. Dēor willaþ cunnan þīnne mildan æthrine. Ēa þoteriaþ on langoðe for þīnre wiermðe. Stānas tōġīnaþ for sorge. Ealle herġaþ þē, þe wæs.*

I didn't actually realize how nice it was until I read it twice. You have an appreciation for beauty.

Anyway, given the fact that you're a beginner and the kinds of errors you're making, I have a couple suggestions. First, if you want to know more about a word, you should use [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and [the website for the Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary](http://www.bosworthtoller.com/). The Bosworth-Toller is easily the most useful resource I've seen; it contains almost every Old English word you come across, and it gives examples of when each one has been used, so you can look up how a word is used and not just its meaning and classification. You should also look up a word in wiktionary if you want to learn its etymology, how it's inflected, and which words in other languages it's related to.

As a European I will say that isn't a positive at all because unfortunately what you don't take into account is the need for young people in the economy. Europe is a disaster since our age pyramids are inverted (we have more 40-50 year olds than 18-30 year olds). Soon our economies will grind to a halt when that generation retires and there arent enough people to fill qualified and non qualified roles. We also have massive unqualified immigration which is unable to integrate either society or the job market efficiently. Finally there is the fact that we have fertility below replacement rate which means we will be replaced by foreigners.

&gt; The problem lies in Africa. The African population is very rapidly increasing. Today the African population counts more than a billion people. By 2050 Africa would have 2.5 billion people, and 80% of these will be less than 30 years old. The problem with and underpopulated developed continent (400 million Europeans by 2050) sitting right next to an overpopulated undeveloped country is of course migration. European countries today already struggle to deal with immigration and the European borders are quite restricted (especially in the East), but imagine immigration today in a much, much larger scale.

That is generally a problem with the Southern hemisphere and especially with Africa. Simply put if there is a massive exodus, Europe at this point will implode similarely to the scenario of the great book (which I recommend although its depressing) **""Camp of saints"" by Jean Raspail**.

What probably happens in that scenario is some countries  capitulate whilst others (East Europe mostly) close their borders and wage aggressive war on the rest of the continent which has been taken over.

But I believe the end will not come from that. I think the end will come rather in a major war that will weaken European and American governments enough to ALLOW such masses to come into the country.

&gt; Drop Nineteens were a Boston-based indie rock band. They were one of a few U.S.-based bands who styled themselves on England's distinctive shoegazing sound, taking inspiration from bands such as Ride and Lush. Much like the Pixies before them, they were more widely acknowledged in the UK, where the then-unsigned Drop Nineteens first gained attention with two 8-track demos.

&gt; Signing to Caroline Records (home to Smashing Pumpkins, Hole), but with their records released on Hut in the UK, Drop Nineteens immediately garnered college radio airplay in the US with their 1992 debut album, Delaware. Formed by Greg Ackell (vocals, guitar), Steve Zimmerman (bass), Chris Roof (drums), Motohiro Yasue (guitar), and Paula Kelley (vocals, guitar), the band made three music videos that were prominently played on MTV. They also topped the UK's Indie Album &amp; Singles charts with early releases, toured on the success of their first album, headlined/co-headlined and opened tours in England, Europe, and North America, recorded BBC radio sessions for John Peel and Mark Goodier, and played summer music festivals like England's Reading Festival and North America's Lollapalooza.

&gt; Due to artistic differences, several member changes occurred between the first and second full length releases. Kelley, Roof, and Yasue went on to pursue other interests, and Megan Gilbert (vocals, guitar), Pete Koeplin (drums, now drummer for the band Kahoots) and Justin Crosby (guitar) were added to the lineup in 1993. Shortly thereafter, Drop Nineteens released their second full-length album, National Coma, but after a disappointing reaction to this record and various artistic differences the band broke up in 1995. 

&gt; Beyond Drop Nineteens, Ackell and Koeplin recorded an album under the band name Fidel in the late nineties, which was never formally released. Kelley went on to lead Hot Rod, Boy Wonder, and is currently a solo artist with the Paula Kelley Orchestra. Rumors of a third Drop Nineteens album have circulated over the past decade, but no release date has ever been announced.

You can annex *only* Fars and Khorasan instantly. You have to normally annex Sistan, Afghanistan and Transoxiana.

Also the cost to annex is 10 per development, and if you don't annex Transoxiana, opting to release them, they tend to back the rebellion of the remaining vassals. So the faster you annex Sistan and Afghanistan, the sooner you have Transoxiana who during this period you can safely keep under control as a march while stacking the Islam Iqta goverment's magical button powers i.e ""lenient taxation"" for a further -15% liberty desire. 

Also vassal feeding to annex is the proven way to cost save on admin points. So stacking the standard -50(45?)% diplomatic annexation cost(25% from here, 20-25% from a policy elsewhere) you can find from ideas lets you pay only 5 points per development.

Transoxiana once under control gets lots of liberty desire reduction due to culture group, ruling dynasty, same religion etc; thus making an ideal vassal to feed until they are about to pop at around 400 development. Since they already have a lot of land to support a small army, this makes them ideal for feeding them the rebellious lands in the steppes before annexing them.

Additionally Influence ideas gives a -20% to AE and halves the diplomatic cost to annex provinces that aren't part of the war goal.  Its events are also some of the kinder ones in the game. Some of the events have decent bonuses, most of the bad events give manageable negatives. If you have the -20% AE reduction and roll the ""Just Cause"" event, you get a whopping -40% AE which can be further stacked with a policy to -50%. This would allow you to pretty much steam roll an area of a map.

Finally Influence-Innovative gives a -10% advisor cost and -10% AE policy. Advisor cost reductions are invaluable for out of Europe nations that need to spend 2x the points typically to get the same tech as Europe. This is why Ming is cutting edge the most of the game; they get a -25% at full merit.

To charge 3 billion people $1100 more to subsidize half the world, while the other 3 billion don't, doesn't seem very ethical to me - considering that more specific indicators don't raise premium by nearly as much. Again, I don't have experience here.

I read an article a few days on propertycasualty360 that was talking about people who were fined for talking on the phone when driving, and whose premiums were raised on average by $300. Getting tickets in general raised premiums by $200-$1400. Surely a much more identifying piece of info like that should make a larger difference?

False,axsis,,,,"&gt; there's a reason lactose intolerance is a thing.

Yes but this depends on genetics and ancestry. I have no issues with dairy but I'll concede my SO reacts differently especially if it's slightly off. 

Additionally, there are cheeses with very small levels of lactose (cheddar, parmesan, brie, camembert, and swiss etc). I think the issue is very much framed in a particular political goal (that of encouraging veganism) since most lactose intolerance occurs with African and Asian populations, populations which generally made cheese without much lactose (e.g. Paneer) and did not necessarily adapt to it. 

So the statement: 
&gt; Our best diet is driven by evolutionary history, and we are the only mammal who continues to consume milk and milk byproducts beyond early childhood. It can't be good for us, there's a reason lactose intolerance is a thing.

Is false because as part of my European evolutionary history my body has adapted to process lactose reasonably well. To ignore our recent evolutionary history and go with a blanket statement is rather bizarre. Further the line: ""only mammal who continues to consume milk and milk byproducts"" is a denial of our pastoral history as a species. 

Now if I made a statement like ""Our closest relatives eat insects, therefore we should eat insects"", would you start eating insects?  

Or,  ""Our closest relatives don't eat a huge amount of meat"", or, ""Our closest relatives don't eat eggs regularly""... You can see this has the potential to be a huge rabbit hole and I'm sure I could find a way to phrase these in ways similar to the dairy statement, and this is why I detest the premise of the Paleo diet. It relies on Psuedoscientific cognitive bias...the idea that we can neglect evolution when it's convenient, it's the same as the vegetarians who claim we should be eating a barley rich diet because that's what 'Gladiators' ate...

False,Absolut_Null_Punkt,,,,"&gt; There is an old delicious Soviet joke about radio Yerevan: a listener asks “Is it true that Rabinovitch won a new car in a lottery?”, and the radio answers: “In principle yes, it’s true, only it wasn’t a new car but an old bicycle, and he didn’t win it but it was stolen from him.” Does exactly the same not hold for the fate of Marx’s teaching today, 200 years after his birth?

I lol'd.  


&gt; (1) it constitutes the majority of society; (2) it produces the wealth of society; (3) it consists of the exploited members of society; (4) its members are the needy people in society. When these four features are combined, they generate two further features: (5) the working class has nothing to lose from a revolution; (6) it can and will engage in a revolutionary transformation of society.[1] None of the first four applies to today’s working class, which is why features (5) and (6) cannot be generated

I'm curious as to how he qualifies his comments on the first four, that if the proletarian is no longer the majority (in a given society) then who is?  Is this statement a ""global"" one?  If so, then has the Proletariat every been the global majority?  Even in Marx's time there existed the large swaths of peasantry, hunter gatherer, tribal, and other pre Capital social groups.  

Point 5 I think has always been a bit more fluid.  There are always reactionary elements within the working class who act in a manner contrary to their ""class interests"" because their way of life will be changed in one way or the other.  Access to commodities is an intoxicating influence and their absence terrifies both the reactionary and class conscious proletarian.  

The historical example of ""reactionary proletarians"" has always defined those who were politically opposed to ""Stalinist"" regimes.  For many this is still what they mean when they say ""reactionary"".  But in 2018 can we say that these working class people were wrong, even if they couldn't articulate precisely why, since the reasoning wouldn't have been known before the implementation of these policies.  

&gt; The historical deadlock of Marxism resides not only in the fact that it counted on the prospect of capitalism’s final crisis, and therefore couldn’t grasp how capitalism came out of each crisis strengthened. 

I mentioned this in a few other posts on this sub in the past month or so.  Specifically that Marx, Lenin, Bordiga, and the likes of Malcolm X made comments and analysis absent the past 60 years of Capital crisis and Revolutionary failures.

&gt;  The latest version of this idea relates to the refugees: only an influx of a really large number of refugees can revitalize the European radical Left. This line of thought is thoroughly obscene and cynical. 

Agreed on this point, and wonder if this thought process is rooted in the self aggrandizing attitude of the modern Leftist where ""we just have to educate them properly"".  

&gt; The point is not just that revolution no longer rides the train of History, following its Laws, since there is no History, since history is a contingent open process. The problem is a different one: it is as if there were a Law of History, a more or less clear predominant main line of historical development, and that revolution could only occur in its interstices, “against the current.” Revolutionaries have to wait patiently for the (usually very brief) period of time when the system openly malfunctions or collapses, seize the window of opportunity, grab the power which at that moment as it were lies on the street, is up for grabs, and then fortify its hold on power, building repressive apparatuses, etc., so that, once the moment of confusion is over and the majority gets sober and is disappointed by the new regime, it will be too late to get rid of it, given its firm entrenchment.

I left my first PhD program after two years and after that took up a teaching job for two years and now I am planning to apply for the PhD on   the same topic again. In my first PhD i was not a failure , I took all  advanced level  courses and got decent grades. However my advisor who  is a nice person  otherwise works very fast and wants immediate results  while since it is  theoretical physics I was in general overwhelmed by  the sheer amount of  things I did not know and needed some time to  adjust while the advisor  just wanted to pick up topic and start working  and had little patience  for mistakes which I made a lot in the  beginning. I got very little time  to absorb things on my own and since I  am mostly a self taught person  it was more difficult for me to work as  per his schedule. He advised me  to change advisor however no one in  our department was working on the  same topic and changing advisor would  have meant changing topic of my  PhD which I was not willing to do. So I  just quit my PhD ,took two years  break , did projects with other  postdoc , faculties of different  universities and currently have four  papers under my belt. Have very  strong background on all advanced  topics in Physics. And am extremely  comfortable with research now \(  something I was not during my first PhD  since I have had time to absorb  thing my way\) I have managed to secure  two letter of recommendations  which are not from my ex advisor.

Most recently we had a holiday get together and before we even had dinner, my grandmother got angry over something trivial, screamed at everyone (in front of friends, too - this wasn't just family, these were people who didn't even *know* her) and she got up, left, and told my father in no uncertain terms to go fuck himself, and that we're all just a bunch of rude fucks who don't care about her.  

It was supposed to be a nice evening, and she ruined it.   This was a constant in my childhood, people *ruining* things.  Birthdays, graduations, vacations to Europe, all of them were like this.

&gt; Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.

&gt; Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. 

&gt; The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.

&gt; After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).

&gt; In November 2006 Condon was ""briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion"", the band's website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. 

&gt; Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec &amp; Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon's previous efforts. The second EP 'Holland' was credited to Condon's old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.

&gt; The band's album ""The Rip Tide"" was released in 2011.

False,FriedJesus,,,,"Like I said, I don't think all US police officers are terrible people and they purposefully kill people just for fun, but I see waaaaay to many video's on reddit alone, not to think you have a serious problem with your police force. I do agree that the Media sensationalizes a lot and I often see videos where the cops handled a situation pretty much perfectly, but that doesn't make a video like this or Daniel Shaver or the one where a guy gets beaten on by 5 guys for jaywalking any less terrifying. 

&gt;European countries don't have 50% of their crime committed in big cities, by black people, against black people, nor do they have the thug culture or glorification of violence and crime that our ghettos have. When Europe has crime like us, then you go ahead and compare, but our crime is just nothing alike. Your version of crime is a man running around naked or a shouting match, ours is gang violence and 30% of our murders being unsolved.

First of all, what a ridiculous over-generalization. Europe isn't one single country. Where I live we have plenty of pretty fucked up crimes, not to mention terrorist attacks. Especially in cities and especially in certain neighborhoods where police are scared to patrol and there's a heavy anti-police, anti-western culture sentiment. However we still manage to not shoot a thousand people every year. Second of all, 30% of murders unsolved? Isn't that the police fucking up? You think that stat somehow supports your argument?

&gt;when they say ""18 times"", you're thinking of police holding the trigger for 5 seconds at a time. 

No, I wasn't. I'm perfectly aware with how a taser works and I watched the video. There was no reason to taser the guy in the first place. Tasers are pretty dangerous weapons, even though most of the time they're non-lethal, they can cause serious heart problems. I didn't see any signs of resisting before the first tase. The guy just seemed confused and scared. 2 police officers should be strong enough to just take the guy and hold him, or at least ATTEMPT that before you reach for a taser, for fuck's sake. 

&gt;Nobody tells you how 600 out of the 750 people shot had a deadly weapon, most of the time a gun. Nobody mentions that a dozen cops are assassinated a year. But everybody loves a story that could paint the millions of police officers as tyrannical or brutal because of the actions of less than 12 a year.

Really? Just by a quick google search I found that US officers shot and killed almost 1000 people in 2017, sure most of them had a gun or were fleeing, but in 22 cases they were unarmed, not fleeing and didn't have any sort of mental illness. By contrast the UK police officers killed 5 people in all of 2017. All of them were legitimate terrorists. If you deny that your country doesn't have any sort of issue with your police force, I'm sorry, but you're a moron.

Why are you so anti-immigrant? The Irish are all immigrants too you know. It's weird you're against protestant immigration but want freedom of movement with the EU.

&gt;Idiots like you want to fucking start the fight again

Northern Ireland doesn't get to veto the will of the British people. If the fighting starts again then that is the responsibility of those who do the fighting. The Irish are the ones responsible if there is a hard border. They have made the choice to remain in the EU just like we made the choice to leave. There are thousands willing to fight to prevent Northern Ireland being removed from the UK too. Why do their terrorist threats not warrant a mention, but only the IRA's threats? 

&gt;despite the fact the brown people DON'T COME FROM THE EU.

Not everyone in the EU is white. Every single EU member state has the power to give everyone in the world EU citizenship which would allow them to move to the UK. Tens of millions of the most illiberal peoples on the planet would be able to move to the UK, and we'd only be able to deport them after 3 or 6 months (I forget which). Given that the defense minister of Greece a year before our vote to leave, stated that he would flood the EU with migrants including members of ISIS if Greece was left in its economic crisis, there was a very real risk of staying in the EU that you are completely ignoring.

If you don't want that, you shouldn't want to be in the EU either.

Nobody is incentivised to treat anybody better unless it is conducuve to profit making. If slave labour were conducive to profit making in our current circumstances in the USA and europe, it would be happening, thankfully it isn't.

Why I think tech didn't change:
Besides the fact that it did, this slowness you are alluding to is due to one simple thing, which is the fact that people are only free to innovate if they have the time and the means to do so. Technology devaloped before the devalopement of capitalism made large scale production possible, which made less people needing to work for our basic survival needs and more possibilitys to invent, irregardless of capitalism.

The fact that soviet russia couldn't compete with the US is found in global capitalism. The USSR might have called itself socialist, but really what it was was state capitalism (aka a system in which the state is the only capitalist). Given this, the policies they had enacted to appear socialist made them unviable in the long run, as they needed to import some goods. Other factors may include geography, demographics and many, many more.

Also, any structure that centralised is very unstable if it requires its citicins to create the wealth since many people want to be at the head and can organise against the ruling class because of the things the ruling class has to maintain to create said wealth. 

BTW: the rennesaince is bullshit as anything else than an concept in art history, not really other subcategories of history.

False,ready-ignite,,,,"&gt; Set aside the fact no one asked Israel to be the independent police of this agreement.

Note that senior US officials including Pompeo flew into Jordan, then traveled to Israel, the evening before this speech. In addition issued a [statement](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-pompeo-saudi-arabia-iran-20180428-story,amp.html) just before then that the US stands with Israel and Saudi Arabia against Iran. The US was present for the event indicating alignment with the message.

&gt; *What we are seeing is a dance. A play. A theatrical performance *meant to appease the general population and generate just enough apathy in the general public that those in power don't feel they'll lose power attacking Iran. This has happened before. It's happening again. No one will care. No one can stop it.

I agree that this is a theatrical performance. I see indications that this is not run-up to war however, but setting the table for negotiations similar to what we observed in North Korea.

Go back to Nancy Pelosi's statement a week or two ago regarding her trip to North Korea. In it her aide whistles at her indicating she has delved into classified territory when she brings up the topic. She cavalierly continues on anyway, seemingly oblivious to the signal, and describes how when weapons development was brought up as a topic the North Korean's stated they eagerly offered weapons sale to the US dignitaries. Demonstrates sign that weapons development was for economic reason for sale on the black market. 

Reviewing North Korea and the tech available within the country, the country does not demonstrate a top notch R&amp;D capability exists. Take a close look at their soldier parades in recent years. The weapons they carry are old 1950s tech with oddity modifications such as a heavy cylindrical mag welded to them. Not something in practice you'd want to carry around and not particularly effective. Then look at the rapid advancement of missile and nuclear research effort, in a country struggling to keep the power on. Where did the technical know-how and ability to execute on designs come from?

Assume coming out of that Pelosi meeting an arrangement was made. Or maybe already existed. Intel agency provides weapons design and manufacture expertise to the country, NK sells on the black market to rebel insurgency groups or other rogue countries, intel agency gets a cut of funds changing hands for dark money off the books projects. Think to the cartels in Breaking Bad, or even Scarface. Once you're in an arrangement such as this, you're running drugs for the cartel, what happens if you ever try to back out? What happens if you don't hit your sales targets? Once these arrangements were in place one would presume that with communication lines and access to the country came with it means to reach out and harm NK leadership. The problem with war in the peninsula in that scenario is a hostage situation. Leverage, negotiation with, or otherwise eliminate the hostage takers pressuring for continued profiteering would be the key lever toward a peaceful solution.

Assume Iran is in a similar hostage scenario with deals to make arms production available on the black market in return for weapons R&amp;D support. The fun case of Uranium 1 comes back into play again. Where did the uranium go after leaving the US? We know it went by trucking company through Canada. We know it then went on to the EU passing through to presumably Russia. Where did it go from there? How is it being used? Did any of it go to Iran? What about North Korea?

How about after the Iran deal? Any chance there was relocation of Iranian nuclear program into Syria, including Uranium 1 material? Are we able to track flights into Syria that elude to such a relocation? Does the money flowing into Iran as part of the nuclear deal with the US currently fund the ongoing program? How much of the funding from that US/Iranian deal is skimmed off by the EU?

If there is merit here, can the table be flipped and lay groundwork for new negotiations by negotiating with or otherwise cutting ties with any group in a position to apply pressure on Iran, keeping them in the weapons for black markets game? Freed from those economic arrangements, could Iran then negotiate in good faith and created a new path forward similar to what we see developing in North Korea?

It is interesting that Netanyahu stopped at discussing historic events. The presentation is left not particularly persuasive in and of itself. It looked like theater serving a couple points, on one hand informing the public of behind the scenes detail here. The public should question whether it's a trustworthy source or not. I suspect by end of the week or early next week after there has been some time for discussion that we'll get additional statements describing nuclear targets already hit by missile strikes in Syria. On the other side it puts cards on the table signaling to EU, Iran, and other players that it's time to end the round and get to work on next steps. 

The story appears to be that either a high level defector from Iran came in, Israel got someone deep inside the program, carried out some sort of raid to acquire materials, or is just making it all up. The response from Iran has not been to come out and state it's all made up. Instead they made noises of leaving the US/Iran deal. Thus I'm leaning toward higher probability the materials exists. That gets in potential that methods and means Israel used to acquire materials may come under scrutiny and the ability to use those methods closed. Not ideal. Thus has to be a big reason for showing the information displayed.

It's possible this does lead to beating of war-drums similar to Iraq or other misadventures. We should keep in mind that history does not necessarily repeat, but kinda rhymes.

False,The-Autarkh,california-flag,,California,"&gt;There are some arguments so dumb only President Trump could take them seriously. That’s the only conclusion you could reach after seeing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s faux-dramatic speech yesterday, in which he literally pulled a sheet off of a pile of documents, like a magician unveiling a cage full of doves, to demonstrate Iran’s dishonesty about its nuclear program.

&gt;The point of the act was to convince Trump to pull out of the nuclear agreement negotiated in 2015 between the United States, Iran, China, Russia, France, the U.K, Germany, and the European Union, and it just might succeed.

&gt;Which in turn could make a nuclear agreement with North Korea all but impossible.

&gt;As you look around at these high-stakes matters of foreign policy and national security, you quickly realize that everyone, no matter which side they’re on, takes it as a given that the president of the United States is an infantile half-wit, and they must adjust their strategies accordingly.

&gt;...

&gt;It’s more than obvious that Trump wants to pull out of the nuclear agreement and always has. But up until now he’s been restrained by a group of sane senior advisers who have repeatedly insisted to him that the agreement is successfully restraining Iran and that if it disintegrated, there would be little to stop Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon, exactly the outcome Trump claims he wants to avoid and that the agreement was intended to forestall.

&gt;Unfortunately, with the departures of Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, that group has been reduced to one person: Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Just last week Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee “the verification, what is in there, is actually pretty robust as far as our intrusive ability,” because “it is written almost with an assumption that Iran would try to cheat.” Mattis now finds himself outnumbered, because Tillerson and McMaster were replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two longtime critics of the deal who seem only too happy to see it collapse. Bolton in particular has long advocated military action against Iran.

&gt;So right now you have one person, Mattis, who is trying to prevent Trump from doing what he really wants to do, and two people, Pompeo and Bolton, who are encouraging him to give in to his desires and walk away from the agreement. Who do you think is going to win that argument?

&gt;But it doesn’t stop there. If you were Kim Jong Un and you saw the United States abandon a painstakingly negotiated agreement to restrain Iran’s nuclear program, how could you possibly trust that that whatever promises were made to you in exchange for scrapping your own weapons would be kept?

&gt;Unfortunately, with the departures of Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, that group has been reduced to one person: Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Just last week Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee “the verification, what is in there, is actually pretty robust as far as our intrusive ability,” because “it is written almost with an assumption that Iran would try to cheat.” Mattis now finds himself outnumbered, because Tillerson and McMaster were replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two longtime critics of the deal who seem only too happy to see it collapse. Bolton in particular has long advocated military action against Iran.

&gt;There, too, everyone is acting like Trump is a fool. South Korean president Moon Jae-in, when it was suggested that he be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to ease the conflict with North Korea, replied: “President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize.” He said this knowing full well that nobody’s getting any prizes before any true agreement is reached, especially given the many times the North and South have briefly opened up ties and promised newly warmed relations only to slip back to the status quo. But he also knows that Trump’s massive ego and rampaging insecurity mean that showering him with praise is the best way to get what you want from him.

&gt;One world leader after another, from Netanyahu to Moon to Xi Jinping to Emmanuel Macron to the Saudis who gave him that gold medal, has realized that this president is easy to manipulate. Treat him like a big shot, shower him with compliments, tell him what he wants to hear, and he’ll be putty in your hands, at least for a while.

&gt;But eventually Trump has to make a decision. And when he takes the U.S. out of the Iran agreement, as he probably will, that will all but guarantee that Kim won’t be willing to scrap his nukes because the United States says it will give North Korea something in return.

Seize the institutions that promote it. A bureau which censors public media, as well as purging most academics from their positions to be replaced by people who aren't anti-nation and anti-family could solve most of the problems. The fact is that most reactionary positions are neuro*typical*, if people were left alone they would simply drift towards them naturally. The constant indoctrination by media and government and academia tries to suppress it, but the tendencies are still there.

&gt;How do you propose to create an ethnostate?

Reactionaries are not necessarily pro-ethnostate as some on the alt-right are. We see it as a good thing, but we're more spiritual than we are racially based. The typical ""Spencer"" argument seems to be deportations as well as encouragement for more white immigration. Jared Taylor by contrast argues that if you get rid of the institutional bias against whites identifying as whites, then an ethnostate will develop organically--perhaps somewhere in the midwest.

&gt;How do you propose to counter the international cabal of Globalists?

You make it sound like a conspiracy theory rather than greedy and insane bastards destroying our countries for their own gain. The fact is that the best way to stop ""the globalists"" is to create a society where the merchant class doesn't hold all the power.

To some degree, we still see things in the manner of three estates: Aristocracy making up the warriors of a society, Clergy making up the priestly class, and Merchants making up the politicians and businessmen. Each ""class"" is important for the basis of maintaining a civilized society, and its the way of things that each society can cycle through the three classes; Aristocracies tend to form dictatorships and monarchies. The Clergy tends to create societies bound by faith, such as the Islamic caliphates or to some degree, Western Europe during the ""dark age"" immediately following the Western Roman Empire's collapse.

All three classes are important to maintaining society, but its the way of the merchant class to be the most troublesome. Without warriors, a society is weak and can be conquered easily. Without clergy and religious guidance, societies become immoral and prone to their own destruction. Without the merchants, societies can become poor and find themselves obedient to foreign powers. Yet given the only value of the merchants is gold, they tend to push the envelope in the form of social change: they can talk a big game about ""Women's rights"", but all it really boils down to for liberals is more human resources to exploit. Things like virtue, or identity, mean nothing to them and may actually hamper them, so they seek to push things to the next extreme, always at the cost of society as a whole.",True,False,0,1525197915,,False,0,dya2oks,False,t3_8g0ptx,True,t3_8g0ptx,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/8g0ptx/all_i_have_some_questions_about_various/dya2oks/,,1526958215,1,False,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,public,

My mistake. A legitimate brain fart. Though if you use a Pacific Ocean centered map then it still follows. The Caribbean including T&amp;T are east of the Pacific and Africa is west of Pacific (as well as west of Asia).

&gt;second, caribbean accents and african accents often have a lot in common due to common languages in a lot of the caribbean countries being spanish/french/english pidgins. t&amp;t in particular has a lot of descendants of african slaves who were brought from spain's colonial holdings in africa. 

It'd be like saying Louisiana creole or AAVE sounds like an African accent or American or Canadian English sounds like a European accent.  Also what does that even mean? A Yoruba person from Nigeria doesn't sound like a Xhosa person from South Africa or a Somalian or an Egyptian. A T&amp;T accent is most similar to other english speaking countries in the americas. It's not an African accent. Like you stated it has been influenced by colonial european languages, african languages, and Indian languages it is distinct enough not to be considered an ""african accent"" which like I said is a dubious phrase to begin with.

Mmmhhh... If you say so.

&gt;That has everything to do with the UK political process and very little to do with brexit though

The GFA is an international treaty, not an internal UK matter. One party of the treaty is an EU member and this member chose to bring the open questions into the Brexit negotiations. 

&gt;That depends entirely on what the UK and EU agree, it is certainly possible..

Doubt it. There are dozens of agreements which stand in the way of a fudge. The MFN clause of the WTO, the self-determination of the EU itself, Turkey's and Ukraine's customs arrangements, the pan Euro-Mediterrranean convention, basic WCO rules, several FTAs of the EU, open skies agreement...

Shall I continue? Brexiters are the establishment now. They need to answer these questions.

&gt;It reduces the rights of every EU citizen (the loss of the right to live and work in the UK..), but it is still not an unfriendly act

Come on. That's not a serious proposition.

&gt;any more than joining the EU was an unfriendly act to the UK's then major partners

Yes. The UK decided that the rest of the Commonwealth wasn't worth any more to subsidize. New Zealand wasn't happy about the accession of the UK into the EC.

&gt;What you are suggesting is that no country can ever leave the EU without that act, in and of itself being unfriendly. 

Yes. It is not the end of the world, but the UK redefines its international position fundamentally. It will be a less close, less compromising and perhaps even antagonistic towards other EU members. The interests will diverge more and more.

&gt;So you are equating the UK leaving the EU, with Germany signing a military memorandum with a hostile power? the hostile bit would be enabling a hostile power and bringing that to the borders of its fomrer allies..

Yes. It would be a fundamental redefinition of Germany's international positioning, as it is Brexit.

False,CaravanOfDeath,,5abe77de-24f8-11e5-bb11-0ef63926eacd,#HighToryGang,"The planned visit of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to the United Kingdom in July is well-timed and of great importance. By then the European Union Withdrawal Bill ought to have passed into law and a mere three months of negotiations are scheduled to settle the terms of our departure. Once we have left our alliance with the EU, the United States will be even more central to our foreign policy than it currently is, especially as we are unlikely to be flavour of the month with the EU after our departure.

It is our national good fortune that the president with whom we will develop this new arrangement is Mr Trump. His election depended upon similar factors to those that led to Brexit. He appealed to voters left behind by the metropolitan elite and he exudes confidence about his own nation and a determination not to be a manager of decline, which also inspires the Brexiteers.

This has had an important effect on American foreign policy which had consistently supported Britain’s engagement with the European Union from the days of the Coal and Steel Community in the 1950s. Former President Obama’s rude and counterproductive intervention in the referendum debate, telling us to get to the back of the queue, was an undiplomatic reminder of how the US saw its position.

It will, therefore, be necessary to show the Americans how our departure from the EU will be in their national interest, too. Donald Trump has supported Britain’s decision to leave the EU out of conviction and principle but if that could be bolstered by robust self-interest, so much the better.

The standard US view was that Britain could temper the incipient hostility to its power within the European councils. The proposition was that if one of the key member states were a true friend who could lessen some of the jealousy and unnecessary competitiveness exhibited towards the US this would advance America’s interests. In this way Britain could make an important regional power marginally more helpful to the US in pursuing its global aims.

The US accepted that because of its ties to the EU, Britain could not be as supportive as it might otherwise have wished to be in all circumstances. It could be held back by the sometimes irrational concerns of other member states, and the unwillingness to impose sanctions against Russia in recent years is a case in point.

As the US is about to lose a moderating ally in a major but sometimes difficult regional organisation, what is it going to get in return? This is where Britain has something genuine to offer to America, for so many of its values are similar. Indeed, with the common law and a parallel constitutional settlement the two nations are the world’s most longstanding democracies.

Free from its ties to the EU, Britain will be able to co-operate more fully with the US in its global efforts. Sometimes the sheer size and power of America makes it harder for it to deal with a smaller nation with whom we may have an excellent relationship.

In this way Britain can change from being a lukewarm friend exercising a calming influence to having a real special relationship. This is only “special” if it is in the United States’ interest, for every country in the world knows that its link to America is its overriding foreign relationship. Whether it is Germany, India, Israel or Taiwan, all view their link to the US as “special” but for America all this specialness is routine.

After Brexit, the US and Britain could push our shared values in all international forums, arguing for new solutions for the next generation rather than being held back by the EU’s efforts to protect vested interests.

However, this opportunity is dependent upon Mr Trump’s presidency. Without him the US would be offering no support for Brexit and would be seeking to frustrate it. He ought to be treated with every possible courtesy when he comes, both as befits the office he holds and in gratitude for his goodwill towards the nation of his mother’s birth. The red carpet that is laid out must be spotless and the evidence of our close relationship on clear display.

In addition, we would be wise to offer the US something tangible that would help the president’s agenda, not just fine words. If that means presenting a free trade deal or suggesting a London-New York agreement on financial regulation, which would become the global standard, the duty of “sincere co-operation” with the EU must not be an impediment. Opportunities need to be grasped and not evaded because of passing bureaucratic convenience.

Inevitably there will be demonstrations when Mr Trump visits but the US constitution has greater protections for freedom of speech than our own, so protest is part and parcel of political life. It is the official welcome that matters and it should be of the greatest warmth, ideally backed up by a clear vision of how our two great nations can co-operate in future.

Perhaps then Harold Macmillan’s vision of our playing the Greeks to America’s Romans would at last be fulfilled.

It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774. In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire. After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom.

You don't seem to know much about the history of fishing in the UK and the EU, but current quotas are based on historical catches of fish by member States within that area, before the common fisheries policy and before even the EU. Do you want to know what's responsible for the decline of the UK fishing industry? Fishermen and mechanisation.

You know all the stories you hear about harbours having a thousand boats and now only having ten? Guess what, the boats are 100 times the size and capable of catching 1000 times the fish. In the late 90s the EU actually gave UK fishermen 90% grants to build bigger and better boats, those boats then went out and through mismanagement nearly caused the collapse of North Sea fish stocks. The only thing that saved those stocks were quotas and technical conservation measures, each and everyone fought against tooth and nail by the fishing industry. Fishermen don't like regulation. That's the issue and time and time again they've shown that if left to their own devices, they'll take until no more can be taken (have a read about the grand banks cod stocks for a detailed picture of where out fleet would be if it wasn't for the North Sea recovery plan, introduced by the EU.)

False,Casualbat007,,,,"The circumstances surrounding that treaty are extremely complicated, I will do my best to give you a concise, helpful answer without re-writing one of my capstone papers:

Hitler and the Nazis were well aware that their ideologies (the return of lands lost in the aftermath of WWI, uniting all other ethnic-Germans into one state and annexing lands to the east for living space) would mean that they would have to fight another general war in Europe. France and Great Britain were clearly their main foes, as the Soviet Union was not considered to be a major player by either side in the run up to the conflict. 

In WWI, Germany had absolutely crushed the Russian Empire and contributed greatly to the conditions that resulted in the fall of the Tsar and the rise of the Bolsheviks. Since then, the Russians had fought a brutal civil war, saw the rise of totalitarianism under Stalin, and experienced mass famine, arrests and purges. To the other European powers, the Soviet Union seemed to be struggling to function as a state altogether, and otherwise seemed to be in no position to fight any war. However, Stalin saw the writing on the wall, the Nazis were very open and clear in their belief that Bolshevism and Jewry were one and the same and could not coexist with Nazism. Therefor he many numerous attempts to nail out an ironclad military alliance with France and Great Britain. 

But the Nazis were not the only ones who were wary of the communists. The Russian revolution, as most of Europe saw, wasn't about the Tsar or Russia specifically but rather the destruction of capitalism everywhere it is being practiced. Since all of Europe was ""capitalist"" at least by the Bolshevik standard, they felt extremely threatened, and were very motivated to contain, not encourage, the spread of Communism. Add these views of the Soviet State with the aforementioned perceived political, economic and military chaos, Great Britain and France frankly didn't think the Soviets would participate in the next war, and would be more of a burden than a help if they did. For these reasons, Stalin was left on the eve of war without any solid alliances, and became more open to last-minute options. 

For as much as they swore themselves arch enemies, the Soviets and the German government had been cooperating since the end of WWI out of necessity. The Versailles treaty prevented Germany from operating any Tank or air units or developing doctrine, so they agreed with the Soviets in 1929 to set up a training facility in the Soviet Union where, ironically, they developed many of the Blitzkrieg tactics that would later be used against them in 1941. In exchange, the Soviets received help with their industrial efforts and 5 year plans through the sharing of technologies. The Germans, additionally, needed huge amounts of resources from the Soviet Union to build and then maintain their new armies. The Germans additionally suspected the Royal Navy would construct a naval blockade like they did in the First World War, so resources over land from the Soviet Union would become even more essential when the war broke out. It was strongly in Germany's interest to keep friendly with the Soviets until they dealt with the more formidable Western Allies. 

The Germans saw Stalin, rejected by the allies, in no position to go to war, and friends with nobody.  They saw an opportunity to Guarantee the Soviets would not side with the Allies, to secure their resource channels until the moment they saw fit, and to create an element of surprise when they decided to strike. The treaty, at the time, mutually benefited both countries, and Stalin was relieved to know he had at least bought his country some time to prepare for eventual entry in the war.

 



However, as we all know, Germany breaking the pact with Operation Barbarossa might be the most successful surprise attack in history. Its reported that Stalin, arguably the most paranoid man in history,  was not seen or heard from for weeks after the event he was so shook to his core. 

Hope this helps!

Multiculturism brought tourism and a huge revenue for its citizens. It actually envelops more than a third of all jobs in our capital city. It also allows us to study or work abroad thus giving us better chances at life.

The common army would help us as well since most smaller countries have an abysmal army size even though they occupy strategic positions. Like the Baltic states, Greece etc.

The common budget allows to finance growth in poorer regions so they develop faster to reach the levels of the bigger states. Even some larger countries have parts that need these funds like Spain, Italy and even some tpwns in France (france is too centralized arpund Paris) I can't count how many stuff got funded in my country by the EU.

Most of the money that countries give to the EU fund is given back to the same countries as projects and benefits. Its just like a carefully managed fund so that it get fairly shared and much more efficient.

The common law also instated better worker and consumer laws. We benefit from better food quality, pharmaceutical drug quality, electronics, etc. The laws also curtailed corruption due to the economic rules and the fiscal rule.

Ireland's genetic history is a little discontinuous, with the invading/immigrating people ranging anywhere from platinum blonde to very dark brown.

9000 years ago, hunter-gatherers populated the island from Northern Spain/Southern France. Since then, there have been three major 'genetic' invasions: the Celts of continental Europe (2500 years ago), Norse-Vikings (1200 years ago), and the English (850 years ago). There is also, throughout all this time, starting about 5000 years ago, continuous but minor waves of immigration from Great Britain and Western France.

Of those groups, the English, Vikings, and French all had significant dark-haired populations. As for the original hunter-gatherers, it's hard to say because of how far back that is; they might have been very 'Spanish' looking, but they could also very well be the original pasty-white, gingers.

If you're an American, things get further complicated because Americans in modern times tend to massively underestimate their English ancestry. At some point, the English-American identity transformed into a generic American identity, so you'll hear people who are 3/4ths English and 1/4th German refer to themselves as German-American, simply because the latter happens to be more distinguishable.

It's not that confusing, and if you have an open mind, I'd provide a couple interesting texts that detail why these common conspiracies are flawed.

1) A Convenient Hatred: The History of Antisemitism

2) The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History

The rest of your instinct to ""name the Jew"" is mere confirmation bias. If you take, as many trendy neo Nazis are apt to do these days, thirty prominent Jews, and if you photoshop a star of David next to them, and if you create a collage of it, it's an easy psychological argument to say ""LOOK HOW MANY JEWS ARE IN MEDIA.""

The reality is you could find vastly more by sheer volume alone influential Christians and Asians. 

Even if you believe Jews are disproportionately successful, which they are, it's absurd to believe there is some weight they are pulling in a particular direction.

For starters, Ashkenazi Jews are genetically white. They are primarily comprised of Christian converts. Similarly, many European Christians--even Neo Nazis--have a history of hidden Jewish ancestors, who were threatened and forced into converting. 

Why are so many doctors Indian and Asian? Again, these stereotypes are rooted in confirmation bias, but perhaps there is a reason why certain cultures gravitate toward certain career paths. Still, the *vast majority of them are not*. 

The question is, *why does it bother you?*

If you believe that Jews are a hivemind, you are succumbing to irrational, hateful logic, and I encourage you to visit a reform synagogue or talk to a rabbi or attend a Shabbat service and realize that hate and bias arises when we stop seeing the individual.

See the individual. From Islamic extremism to Jewish settler bigots to fundamentalist Christians, hate arises when we stop seeing the individual humans and start to use labels and judgments.

Arm sales: $11.6 billion, total sales: $58.2 billion
Gross profit: $5.3 billion, total workforce: 199,900 
United Technologies makes a wide range of arms — notably military helicopters, including the Black Hawk helicopter for the U.S. Army and the Seahawk helicopter for the U.S. Navy. The company was the biggest employer in the top 10 though arms sales accounted for just 20% of revenue. UTX also produces elevators, escalators, air-conditioners and refrigerators. International sales comprised 60% of the company's revenue in 2012.

9. L-3 Communications (LLL) -- electronics
Arm sales: $12.5 billion, total sales: $15.2 billion
Gross profit: $956 million, total workforce: 61,000
Some 83% of L-3 Communications sales in 2011 came from arms sales, but this was down from what it sold the prior year. The company has four business segments: electronic systems; aircraft modernization and maintenance; national security solutions; and command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Among many products manufactured, the company has become a major provider of unmanned aircraft systems. 

8. Finmeccanica -- aircraft, artillery, engines, electronics, vehicles and missiles
Arms sales, $14.6 billion, total sales: $24.1 billion
Gross profit: $ -3.2 billion, total workforce: 70,470
Italian company Finmeccanica makes a wide range of arms, including helicopters and security electronics. Nearly 60% of the company's sales in 2011 were in arms. Finmeccanica lost $3.2 billion in 2011. The Italian company is currently fending off allegation that it paid bribes to win an approximately $750 million contract to provide 12 military helicopters to the Indian government in 2010. The then-head of the company, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested in February but has denied wrongdoing. Other executives, including the head of the company's helicopter unit, have been replaced, and the company has delayed the release of recent financial results.

7. EADS -- aircraft, electronics, missiles and space
Arm sales: $16.4 billion, total sales: $68.3 billion
Gross profit: $1.4 billion, total workforce: 133,120
The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), based in the Netherlands, had sales in 2011 roughly in line with the prior year. Arms sales comprised just 24% of the company's revenue. EADS and BAE Systems unsuccessfully attempted to merge for $45 billion in 2012, which would have created the world's largest aerospace company. The deal collapsed in October after German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concerns about the merger.

6. Northrop Grumman (NOC) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, ships, space
Arm sales: $21.4 billion, total sales: $26.4 billion
Gross profit: $2.1 billion, total workforce: 72,500
Northrop Grumman's 2011 arms sales comprised about 81% of total sales even after a sharp decline in arms sales year over year. The company attributed the decline to reduced government spending on defense projects. Nevertheless, the company was more profitable than in the prior year.

5. Raytheon (RTN) -- electronics, missiles
Arm sales: $22.5 billion, total sales: $24.9 billion
Gross profit: $1.9 billion, total workforce: 71,000
Raytheon, based in Waltham, Mass., is one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. The company makes the Tomahawk Cruise Missile, among others. Arms sales comprised about 90% of the company's sales in 2011 though they as a total they were lower than in the prior year. The slide hasn't let up. Total sales in 2012 fell 1.5%, and Raytheon is expecting sales to fall 3% in 2013, a projection which doesn't take into account the effects of mandated budget cuts. The company can rely on overseas customers to somewhat offset weak sales at home. As of January, approximately 40% of the company's backlog was booked overseas. The company expects approximately a 5% increase in international sales in 2013.

4. General Dynamics (GD) -- artillery, electronics, vehicles, small arms, ships
Arm sales: $23.8 billion, total sales: $32.7 billion
Gross profit: $2.5 billion, total workforce: 95,100
With 18,000 transactions in 2011, General Dynamics was the third-largest contractor to the U.S. government. Of those contracts, approximately $12.9 billion worth went to the Navy, while an additional $4.6 billion went to the Army. The company's arms sales in 2011 comprised 73% of total sales. Arms sales in 2011 were slightly below 2010 levels. The company makes a host of products, including electric boats, tracked and wheeled military vehicles, and battle tanks. The company announced layoffs in early March, blaming mandated federal budget cuts.

3. BAE Systems -- aircraft, artillery, electronics, vehicles, missiles, ships
Arm sales: $29.2 billion, total sales: $30.7 billion
Gross profit: $2.3 billion, total workforce: 93,500
BAE Systems was the largest non-U.S. company based on arms sales. Arms sales represented 95% of the company's total sales in 2011 even though they were lower as a total of overall sales compared to the prior year. The products BAE sells include the L-ROD Bar Armor System that shields defense vehicles and the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer that provides sophisticated simulation training for military pilots. In 2013, the company said its growth would likely come from outside the U.S. and Great Britain — its home market. BAE noted that its outlook for those two countries was ""constrained,"" likely due to the diminished presence in international conflicts and government budget cuts.

2. Boeing (BA) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, space
Arm sales: $31.8 billion, total sales: $68.7 billion
Gross profit: $4 billion, total workforce: 171,700
Boeing was the second-largest U.S. government contractor in 2011, with about $21.5 billion worth of goods contracted. The Chicago-based company makes a wide range of arms, including strategic missile systems, laser and electro-optical systems and global positioning systems. Despite all these technologies, just 46% of the company's total sales of $68.7 billion in 2011 came from arms. Boeing is the largest commercial airplane manufacturer in the world, making planes such as the 747, 757 and recently, the 787 Dreamliner. The company is also known for its space technology — Boeing had $1 billion worth of contracts with NASA in 2011.

1. Lockheed Martin (LMT) -- aircraft, electronics, missiles, space
Arm sales:$36.3 billion, total sales: $46.5 billion
Gross profit: $2.7 billion, total workforce, 123,000
Lockheed Martin notched $36.3 billion in sales in 2011, slightly higher than the $35.7 billion the company sold in 2010. The arms sales comprised 78% of the company's total 2011 sales. Lockheed makes a wide range of products, including aircraft, missiles, unmanned systems and radar systems. The company and its employees have been concerned about the effects of the ""fiscal cliff"" and sequestration, the latter of which includes significant cuts to the U.S. Department of Defense. In the fall of 2012, the company planned on issuing layoff notices to all employees before backing down at the White House's request

So once I came in to college for A-levels I really started to set my priorities. Really important to talk to yourself ask yourself what you want from your life. Go to a revision room (pretty sure there is one in every school) and dont come out for 2hours. Spend your frees there. Just make yourself do it. Even if your not very productive at first just go there. You spend 2hours trying to do some work for a month and it will become a habit, part of your daily life. Block yourself from all the bs and drama. Become anti-social for a bit. Obviously this is impossible if you dont have a goal. My goal is to get into a decent uni and I know that I have to work hard for that. Also maybe the fact that I come from Eastern Europe I have the hunger to succeed. If you dont have goals that you really want to achieve then motivating yourself is impossible. And lastly do it for yourself not because you want to impress your parents. At the end of the day your parents will be happy with whateva you do because you will be the one living your life.

This was an incredible movie. As with the series; music, animation, background art are all a treat.

I however wasn't fond of Bebe, as I kept having PTSD flashback to episode 3..

I'm not sure how I would qualify the ending, bittersweet doesn't quite adequately describe how it feels. On one hand, ending with Madoka taking Homura with her would have been a beautiful ""happy"" ending, but on the other hand I'm not sure it would have been consistent with the rest of the series. All the wishes of the girls brought what was said to be equal amounts of hope and despair, with the exception of Madoka's wish. Homura turning evil kinda feels like restoring the balance in that regard.

Not relevant to the movie but I still have on question : who was the Walpurgisnacht Witch, and why did she become so powerful? Are clues hidden for a second rewatch? Did her power grow along Madoka's seeing as many fates and timelines depend on her existence?

&gt; education, healthcare, prisons

you couldn't have picked three better examples where capitalistic privatized profit orientation has produced far worse results than socialised systems if we look at it through metrics of equality of opportunity (the more equal i.e. less dependent on previous generations socio economic status the better), social divide (the smaller the better), freedom from fear of illness (less fear is better), or reduction of recidivism post prison (the lower the better). 

If we can agree on these metrics, then the last decades have given a very good case study on the performance of these three areas under a profit oriented privatization  (US) vs a more socialised doctrine (EU). Considering education, last time I checked the academic growth rate (measured on the number of relevant/cited published papers in STEM fields) of the US vs EU was looking quite bleak. Considering healthcare, making it a privatized venture the you are directly pinning public health vs corporate interest. You can compare the rate of uninsured/insufficiently insured people, compare the rate at which people go to regular checkups/take preventive measures or compare the insurance premiums people have to pay (and be careful to take into account their spread and who it affects the most). And at last considering prison: I don't see how a privatized system would a) have any interest in reducing recidivism and b) be actually a viable business venture not dependent on taxpayer money  without being effectively a slave labour camp. 

Also although yes you are technically right that these three things are ""not required for human life"" in that an individual will not necessarily die if they have no access to school, affordable healthcare or a prison system. Humans seem to be a social species and societies do seem to benefit greatly and prosper with providing access to education and helathcare, as well as keeping themselves healthy and relatively safe implementing a prison system to keep bad actors under control.

This is the sort of logic train that leads one to say that Stalin was actually the villain of WW2, not Hitler, since Hitler *only* killed six million jews, while Stalin killed *insert inflated number of all deaths that could ever possibly be attributed to Stalin here*.

There's other ways of thinking about this, though. What about all the people saved by US involvement in WW2? All those lives saved by the war ending quicker, and not living under a Communist regime? What about all the refugees the US *has* taken, leading to it having the largest Jewish population in the entire world? What about the Marshall plan rebuilding Europe, or America's role in role in forcing the west to give up its colonial possessions in the aftermath of WW2? Or any intervention the US has had with positive results, such as preserving the independence of Kuwait, or stopping the genocide in Yugoslavia? (Note: you're going to be tempted to say ""but they did those things *for the wrong reasons*"", and I'm going to say that that hardly makes a difference to the people who were helped).

First of all, just to set things straight: if you think NZ is on the 'pretty dang racist' end of the spectrum, you'll be in for a surprise if you ever visit Asian, African or Eastern European countries. NZ is a very multicultural country (well, the North Island at least) and most people seem to be all good with it.          
As for the 'why' - People like to generalise, that's how the human brain works.            
You notice patterns (or you *think* it's a pattern because of some cognitive bias) such as Chinese people speaking English with a certain accent. Some accents sound worse to your ears and you may be irritated by it... and boom, now you have a negative association with people who speak with that accent - who, in this example, tend to be Chinese. Your opinion of Chinese people is now slightly negative, and thus you will see other things they do in a more negative light. More things they do will annoy you from now on, which just reinforces your bad opinion about them.         
Add to this the fact that a lot of people like to blame others for their misfortune. People from a different ethnic background than you, due to some ancient instincts, will be labeled as 'others' or 'not my kin' more often than the race you grew up with.

When you also state that they are not messianic (for I stated the same) you are absolutely correct.

Here are some beliefs from the wikipedia page of UCG that seem incompatible with Messianic Judaism:  
""Nontrinitarian belief, i.e., that the Holy Spirit is the spirit/power of God and of Christ Jesus rather than a separate person in the Godhead.  
God 'the Father' and Jesus Christ are viewed as two distinct beings in the 'God family,' united in purpose only.[14]  
Belief that Christians are begotten as children in the Family of God and will at their resurrection become  
""spirit-born divine beings who are part of Elohim, the universe-ruling family of God.""[15]  
Belief that the core of Jesus Christ's message was the coming of a literal earthly Kingdom and  
that people who are 'saved' will not go to heaven, but will live and rule eternally with Jesus Christ on earth after  
his second coming, and will subsequently share rulership over the entire universe as part of the 'God Family'.  
UCG also asserts that the final destination of the unrepentant wicked is not everlasting torture, but annihilation  
or permanent destruction.[16] Belief that people of Western European descent, primarily the original British colonies  
and the United States, are direct physical descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of the northern kingdom of ancient Israel,  
whereas the historical Jews (and modern-day Israel) are descendants of the ancient southern kingdom of Judah.  
This belief is not used to assert racial or ethnic superiority, but solely to interpret End Time prophecies  
which are believed to be directed at the United States and Europe.[17] Belief that people who do not know  
or understand the truth of the Bible during their lifetimes will be given time to learn these teachings  
after the ""Second Resurrection"" to a new physical life. After living again in the Millennial world under God's Kingdom,  
those who continue to reject God's Holy Spirit and way of life will be annihilated after  
the ""Third Resurrection"" along with unrepentant former believers who had turned away from God.  
They are destroyed in the third resurrection (the ""resurrection of fire"") in the Lake of Fire,

&gt; The Slovak nation and people had been poorly defined up to this point, as the Slovak people lacked a definitive border or national identity. However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to Magyarize the Slovak region under Hungarian control.
...
You left out important part of your cited source. The Slovak identity was not as collective and well defined as you implied it. Furthermore  a Hungarian or Slovak identity not always matched with actual ethnic background. If you thoroughly take a glance on the ethnic composition of key figures fighting in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 you will see a lot of similar ambiguity, which is no wonder because in mixed areas non-Magyars supported the revolution.  

Some people did not mind Magyar influence, some non-Magyars were even supportive of it.

 Sandor Petofi a revolutionary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 had Slovak origins still refused the invitation of Slovak nationalists, because he unconditionally thought of himself as a Hungarian and believed embracing this identity and culture could make Hungary strong and progressive.

The ~~Hapsburg~~ Habsburg monarchy did not look for friends, if that was the case they would have honored the minorities for their effort. They looked for allies(!), and since they could not solve their problem through the minorities, the minorities political capital evaporated.

&gt; &gt; nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe they would want to secede one day.

&gt; This is putting the ox before the cart.

It was a scenario that had chance to happen. They indeed could not predict it for sure, regardless history verifies them being right. 

I would use a different argument:

nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe it was not only the nationalistic sentiment, but the logic of the time as well to go with the magyarization policy as that was what the most progressive model dictated to be beneficial for the economy. If you take for example the most progressive parts of Europe UK, France and even Spain all of them imposed these policies for the same reason.

&gt;  **Also, isn't is funny that you're basically claiming that only Hungarians should assimilate other nations?**

This is pure chauvinism. It is not the fault of 2nd, 3rd or 4th and so on generations' of people what their ancestors did. In addition the time when forced magyarization happened was the era of nationalism and the peak of it. It happened to be the Hungarians were in position to impose rule over Hungary at that time. It was nothing but expected regulations were nationalistic as like I said both the sentiment and the economic model dictated so to be it. However once that was over it was the world of Wilson's fourteen points and human rights which made any sort of nationalist motivated revenge unjustified. But let's not get so far from Romanians, the Decree of Alba Iulia right in 1918 promised *Full national freedom for all the co-inhabiting peoples.*

False,firecracker42,,,,"&gt;Of course they were going to have German nobility ruling over them, essentially all of Europe had German nobility even during the First World War - the kings of Britain and Russia were Germans. 

There is a difference between being related to other countries kings, which is impossible for a monarch not to be, and literally having Hohenzollerns on your throne, and answering directly to the German crown.

&gt;But I assume you mean they were going to be German Satellites; Finland was free in all but name before the Treaty (it was not going to be a puppet as it was basically already an independent state), the Baltic States were to be ruled essentially as our satellites this is true, Ukraine was to be independent under German guidance, Crimea was to be heavily colonized by Germans granted but you must acknowledge the Volga Germans already present there and this is hardly a genocide, Belarusian culture actually flourished under our occupation and this was the first time in ages that they were encouraged to teach their language in their schools they’ll even tell you that they preferred us over the Russians. The only ‘breeding out’ would be in the Crimea and it was not in the way you would describe it. We would merely have encouraged Germans to emigrate there to develop a promising area of our empire (As a German I love Ukrainians btw). More on the Ukraine- the Entente even recognized them as a neutral state. They supported us economically yes and they were in our sphere of influence but they were an independent state showing their appreciation for their liberators and helping themselves and us economically with their trading of grain.

Yes, I mean puppet states, Finland was formed out of the February Revolution, a year before Brest-Litovsk. And much of Eastern Europe and the Crimea would've been subjected to the Drang Nach Osten, *this is undeniable that Germans, especially the German Empire's government thought of Slavs as lesser even before the Nazis did at those days.*

&gt; Elaß-Lothringen was German and still is today! The Rhine is not Frances natural border, the language and cultural barrier lays west of the Rhine and Elaß-Lothringen rightfully belongs to Germany, it was historically German and the people living there have always (of course not since the beginning of time but you understand) been German - never French. 

This was a doozy, in that case, Poland fully deserves Poznan, since even during the HRE they had it as Polish Lituania if you want to bring antiquated historical province claiming that's completely irrelevant, since french people do live in Alsace, and it's very clear they wish to stay in France.

&gt; I don’t know much about the Kashubians beyond them being West Slavs, however I know they are culturally more similar to us, the fact remains that the land was historically German and inhabited by a large number of Germans and the manner of our expulsion cannot be forgiven or forgotten nor should it. 

The times of the HRE and Polish Lituania prove this wrong that's it's always been historically German, hell going even farther back you can see Slavic tribes extended as far as Brandenburg.  Are you saying that the entente after fighting a war that killed millions of people shouldn't have weakened Germany as a punishment for siding with Austria Hungary on the ideas of declaring war on Serbia, after a rebel group disconnected to the government killed their arch duke and the government refused to be Austria Hungary's new goddamn province? You can't be serious can you, you sniveling imperialist!

&gt;The Versailles Diktat is an unforgivable humiliation inflicted upon the German people, it made the Second World War inevitable - we agreed to an armistice based on Wilson’s Fourteen Points and then they decide they’d rather strangle the most promising nation in the world in its youth, in the brief time the German Empire existed we accomplished more than any other nation did in their entire existence and I am proud that it took the whole world to bring us down- and that our enemies were without honor and dependent on treachery. It’s funny how the West complains about the might of Russia if they had let things be- we had neutered Russia and made a just order in Central and Eastern Europe. You are correct that I would agree with him on a few points -

Again, it's almost like weakening a nation you've just been at war with much like the North German Confederation did against France in 1871, is the point, to keep them weaker. I'm just upset you weren't weakened enough, and Germany, if it was not to be Balkanized after the First World War, 100 percent should've been after the second, with Belgium, Netherlands and France sharing the Rhein.  /s And, a massive possibly hostile in the future power is not much better than a massive currently hostile power.

&gt;however if I were alive at the time my demands would merely be; return to our 1914 borders, have France pay us reparations and occupy large swathes of their contemptible nation as we did in 1871 until they had learned their lesson. 

However if I were alive at the time my demands would merely be; return to our 1812 borders, have Germany pay us reparations and occupy large swathes of their contemptible nation as we did in 1807 until they had learned their lesson. See how stupid it sounds! So does yours! Why would Germany have Slavic lands of Poznan, again I have to say this. Why would France pay reparations for a war they won, against the aggressors that were the central powers?

&gt;I’d likely support a campaign to reestablish the Brest-Litovsk Treaty against the USSR. I honestly wouldn’t want Wilhelm back- he was incompetent. I’d prefer a figure head like grandfather on the throne, I believe Wilhelm’s son would be a good candidate. I’d prefer to see a military junta headed by the General Staff to lead us. 

The USSR needed the industrial and agricultural capabilities of the Ukraine, Poland and Belarus, at that time, today Russia can support itself but expect mass starvation and suffering if it was 1918 since no German empire or German military junta would trade with the Soviet Union especially since they no longer need to, they have their agriculture in the Ukraine already.

&gt;Anyways I disagree with Nazis on far too many things. 1) they are collectivists which I despise with a passion 2) their ideology hinges on us being the master race - there is not master race, race is only ever important when it is connected with culture. Cultures can be superior and inferior- all races are equal. 3) no people deserve extermination, especially not the Jews, the Jewish people helped establish the empire and the German people owe a great deal to their remarkable genius in their contributions to our greatness. 4) His fanaticism prevented victory. He could not set his Nazism aside. Had he prioritized the needs of the Wehrmacht instead of his stupid ideology, we may have won. 5) His rearmament program was unsustainable and forced him into a war that we were not yet prepared for. There are many other things but you get the idea I am not one of them and have nothing but contempt for the National Socialist movement, may Hitler rot in hell were he certainly resides. 

For number one, they where socialists and collectivists in name only. They, like Mussolini's Italy were capitalist and corporatist to the absolute maximum.  That's the point of fascism. I don't see much of a problem with 2 so we'll move on. For 3 even during the German empire there was still rampant antisemitism, Kaiser Wilhelm the second and August Von Mackensen are proof of this. For 4 and 5, In no situation could Hitler have won, unless maybe Lord Halifax before PM of the U.K. and signed peace when France capitulated. Even if they took Moscow their supply line was too stretched to continue.

There was a much more detailed map floating around on the r/ireland sub earlier this year. I'll try to hunt that down. Notably, this study does show a continuity between southern Scotland, Cumbria, and Northern Ireland. However, it loses the nuance in the original maps I saw; the North Leinster\-Ulster group had a significant presence through Ulster.

As for the comparison with Europe, I think you're right. The above study proves that England itself has an even larger divide than between NI and Ireland.

These numbers conflict depending on who collects* them. It's so polarizing the research manages to conflict depending on who you ask.

&gt; I mean, it's been shown, repeatedly, mathematically, that the US spends a retarded amount per capita on healthcare. Socialized countries spend less. Despite this, conservative America continues to claim that socializing ANYTHING makes it a massive convoluted bureaucratic quagmire that guzzles money and doesn't accomplish anything. One of these things is obviously incorrect.

Socialized countries also are much more prohibitive to innovation than the U.S's dynamic system is.

That said, if you want my -personal- opinion, it's this: When I have a private, (albeit nonprofit) healthcare insurer, if they do something I don't like the government can actually act as a 3rd party to rectify it if I get screwed. When the government is your insurer, you're screwed period. We got a $800 bill from the ambulance for my grandmother the other day because Medicare, a federal health insurer, decided that there services (basically saving her life when she had a heart attack) were only worth $400, not the $1,200 they charged. We're on the hook for the rest.

There's no (Accomplishable) appeal. You're screwed. You can't call your buddy Edgar and sue the federal government for your coverage. That's your reality under a medicare for all system.

A absolute NHS style single payer system where the federal government owns everything already exists, it's called the VA hospital system, and every time it's in the news it's not positive. It's also not exactly renowned for producing innovative practices in medicine.

There is this notion that people are only Marxists while they are in college and then they give it up afterwords, but also all the neomarxist college profs have totally distorted all of society somehow. 

Maybe second year comm majors think of themselves as Marxists but it frankly doesn’t matter until they are actually in the workplace and continuing to organize. I similarly don’t take anarchists and the whole antifa thing particularly seriously because it’s not more than a flash in the pan reaction, and possess no real intuitional existence nor deep organizational structure. College Marxists are just as likely to end up anarchists the next year, Neo-reactionaries the next, and then end on being Rawlsian liberals. When I’m referring to Marxists, as with all other political groups, I’m referring to it’s serious elements, and I don’t think there are many serious members of any political ideology who are undergrads. I suspect people who are now “Marxists” from being DSA members for a couple months because they like Chapo Trap House will give you a different answer. Hardened Marxist Leninist will not though. 


You are completely correct that Camus became quite unmarxist, Sartre is a bit more complicated but fair enough. The point is that in 1956 they were definitely both Marxists. And as Marxists they wrote very negatively about the Soviet Unions actions in Hungary. The damage that the Soviet invasion did to the world communist movement is hard to overstate, it is seen in retrospect as a major inflection point. Its after that when all these intellectuals start to drift away. Foucault is another example of somebody who was a Marxist in 56 but two decades later would be extremely critical of Marxism conceptually and the actually existing practice of communism. The British Communist Historians group is a good example of everybody staying communist but breaking alignments with any existing communist state. It would be Trotskyism which would be the overwhelmingly dominate tendency there to this very day. 


As for your last paragraph, something that needs to be understood is that many things look different for us now than to activists in the movement. In the moment communists saw China as a recently decolonized state which was helping other states which were colonized by Europeans throw their oppressors out.

Yemenis like Muhammad al-Houthi and Ali Abdullah Saleh cannot pass in Syria. they have distinctly Yemeni faces and darker skin tone. Some Yemenis have lighter skin but still their face structure is different from Syrians. 

Source: Myself. I've seen Yemeni faces in real life and they cannot pass for Syrians. And look at DNA charts of Middle Eastern ethnicities, Yemenis are on the opposite end of Syrians

Gulf Arabs look different from Yemenis and Syrians. 

Don't try to tell me a Yemeni can even pass as Italian. There is a gradual gradient shift, neighbors shift into each other, Syrians at the northern border will blend into Anatolians and Anatolians in western Turkey then blend into Greeks who then blend into Italians and so on, some Syrians can pass as other Mediterraneans because of this shift around the Mediterranean, but not a Gulf Arab or a Yemeni.

Syrians still have their own DNA mix which is different from Italians and Greeks so most still have their own Syrian looks. Only the Arabs of the Gulf countries are ethnic Arabs and they do not look like Italians. Syrian urban Sunnis are mixed with other ethnicities like Kurds who moved during Ayyubid rule unlike Alawites and Shia.

At the fringes, DNA is shared and passed on because people had lots of sex in the past. Bengalis have the most SEA Mongoloid DNA (20%) out of all South Asians, 

which is apparently shocking- 

NOT, because Bangladesh borders Southeast Asia where lots of Mongoloids live. Other North Indians have less Mongoloid DNA, like 5%. Its obvious why neighbors would share DNA with their neighbors.

Pashtuns and Pamiris live near Mongoloid ethnicities in Central Asia. So 2% of Northeast Asian Mongoloid in Pashtuns isn't surprising. The amount gradually decreases as you move more west, go to Iran and they have less, and generally none in the Arabized Middle East. If anyone has a small amount of Mongoloid in the Middle East its in Sunnis because of Sunni Turkmen migration from Central Asia and mixing in Seljuq times. Alawites would not have it. Partisangirl is a Sunni Syrian and she said her great grandfather was a Turkmen.

Using centimeters thick makeup covered Bollywood celebrities which misleadingly changes the appearance even their face structure  to represent South Asians and Central Asians is one of the most dishonest arguments people can make.

And we must tell Iranian women to stop getting nose jobs to look like Europeans, because apparently they already look identical to them according to you! They must be stupid getting all those nose jobs then if they look like white women? And tell me why I can identify Iranian women and some men by just looking at them, if they supposedly look like white women? Do I have amazing magical powers that can identify people's ethnicity by mind reading? No I don't, its because they have their own looks. They don't look like Arabs, Turks, or Europeans.

Berbers are not Arabs, their DNA is different, they look physically different.

&gt;Scythians weren't an Iranian ethnic group. It was a generic term given to many ethnic groups by the Greeks. Scyth was basically the historic name for East Iranic. While they do share a language with the Pamiris, they were probably genetically closer to the people that live on those lands today and were genetically more European than the Pamiris. Most Pamiris have tan/light-brown skin and black hair. Red hair is very rare among them. Photos on the internet make them look whiter than they really are. They don't look too different to their neghbors who are Tajiks and Afghans.

Don't try to group people by cherrypicked internet photos spread by people with agendas or fetishes. Everyone loves to discover that mystery population of white people. And FYI people try to falsely pass pictures of Nuristanis or Kalash as Pashtuns.

There was a photo on internet forums of a blonde Uyghur girl in Turpan. Everyone must look like her, right?

Except Turpan is known for having the most black haired, Mongoloid Uyghurs IRL.

Southeast Asians also have different autosomal DNA from Northeast Asians. Burmese are mostly Bamarized native SEA so they don't look like East Asians. Thais don't look like East Asians, if you think they look East Asian, you've been seeing too many mixed Thais from Bangkok who have Chinese blood. Rural Thais from northern rural provinces in Isan and Chiangmai don't look East Asian in their facial features and their skin color is NATURAL dark, not just tanned or brown.

Many Filipinos you see can have Chinese ancestry because a lot of Chinese moved to Philippines and mixed with them. Almost all of them claim they have a Chinese great grandfather. Other Filipinos are much more natural dark skin and have SEA facial features.

Sure, some of these MfS agents knew a lot of skeletons and details of domestic and foreign intelligence, but this really does not translate into something very tangible in terms of a security threat. For one thing, German unification and the wider collapse of the Warsaw Pact drastically altered the balance of power in Europe. Knowledge of NATO war plans against the Warsaw Pact or CIA agents in the GDR had less value when both the Pact and the GDR had ceased to exist. MfS agents were also adrift in that there was no large state entity or bureaucracy that could back them up. Some of these agents might have had knowledge of unsavory intelligence techniques, but they did not have the infrastructure to allow them to ply their trade after 1990. There were comparatively few safe harbors for MfS agents in the immediate post-Cold War world, a situation that was unlike 1945 where a number of SD and Gestapo veterans managed to find employment for the emerging Cold War throughout Western Europe. Added to this, the reunified German government also instituted the novelty of opening up the [MfS archives](https://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Archive/_node.html) which meant people had access to their Stasi files. The immediate period after reunification led to a wave of dismissals among civil servants for their roles as MfS informants. This denied the MfS veterans a potential lever for blackmailing former IMs since the files themselves were open. 

Finally, it needs to be stressed that the MfS, while certainly a formidable intelligence agency, was not some totalitarian leviathan. The mature MfS often recruited from within its ranks (fathers and sons for example) and social milieus. This meant that some of its agents were not the cream of GDR society. Its pervasive spying and surveillance often produced a morass of details that could never be analyzed.  Timothy Garton Ash's *The File*, an exploration of the author's MfS file while a student in the GDR, notes that there were tons of irrelevant details. Studies such as Gieske's or Mike Dennis's has shown that a lot of its personnel were devoted to the busywork of intelligence collection. MfS reports might note the curtains of Ash's flat, but the question of whether or not investigating this 20-year old British student was worth the MfS's time is not brought up. The MfS had proven fairly incapable of predicting or preventing the mass disturbances of 1989 despite its massive penetration into GDR society.

&gt; Silverstein is a 5-piece post-hardcore band from Burlington, Ontario, Canada; formed in 2000. The band name was taken from the famous children's author Shel Silverstein.

&gt; After several lineup changes, the band acquired Billy Hamilton, a local fan who learned of the band's need for a bassist on the Internet message board ""The 905 Board"" (an Ontario area outreach board which used to be for local musicians). In Christmas of 2001, he joined the band after Shane Told helped him learn the music for the songs. Following a rehearsal on Boxing Day (December 26) in 2001, he officially debuted with Silverstein. The next spring, original guitarist Richard McWalter left the band to move to Victoria, British Columbia to study engineering. He was then replaced by Neil Boshart, childhood friend of Shane Told. The new lineup recorded a second EP, When the Shadows Beam, in preparation for their first tour in Eastern Canada.

&gt; The band then signed to Victory Records in October of 2002 with a complete lineup as Hamilton attempted to complete his secondary education one semester early. The January after, the band recorded their full-length debut CD When Broken Is Easily Fixed, released on the Victory Records label.

&gt; In 2005 the band performed on the Never Sleep Again tour with bands such as Aiden, Hawthorne Heights and Bayside—a tour during which Bayside's drummer John ""Beatz"" Holohan would be killed. In January-February 2006, they toured with fellow Canadians Simple Plan in Europe. They then toured Canada with the Taste of Chaos Tour, and also toured Europe, Japan, and Australia.

&gt; The band toured on the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, in support of their current studio album Discovering the Waterfront and an EP compilation 18 Candles: The Early Years. The Early years compiles the band's first two self-financed EPs with some acoustic and live material as well as single remix of the Discovering The Waterfront hit Smile In Your Sleep. Discovering the Waterfront was re-released in September 2006 with an extra song, the band's cover of Lifetime's Rodeo Clown and a DVD.

&gt; In 2006, Silverstein was nominated for a Juno Award in the ""Best New Band"" category, but lost to Bedouin Soundclash.

&gt; In Fall 2006, they headlined The Never Shave Again Tour, along with Aiden, It Dies Today, and He Is Legend. Following completion of their third CD, the band played a few shows in the spring, and then engaged in an all-summer tour with Rise Against. The band toured the United States in Fall 2007 with From Autumn to Ashes and then went on a month-long European tour with Blessthefall.

&gt; Following tours of Australia and Japan in January 2008, the band played their first ""Cross-Canada"" headlining tour with Protest the Hero, Ill Scarlett and The Devil Wears Prada, which sold out across the country. They recently completed a U.S. tour with A Day To Remember, Protest the Hero and The Devil Wears Prada. Protest the Hero dropped off the Tour and Pierce the Veil took over for them on a few show dates. They completed a 2008 Europe tour in for May and June, including several festivals, and are playing a limited summer festival schedule.

&gt; In September 2012, the band had announced that Neil Boshart had been fired and would be replaced by Paul Marc Rousseau, who also joined Billy Hamilton on backing vocals. The band achieved moderate success with their second studio album, Discovering the Waterfront, which was nominated for a Juno Award and reached No. 34 on the Billboard 200 charts, with the following two albums charting at similar positions. Silverstein has sold over 1,000,000 albums worldwide.
The band left long-time record label, Victory Records, in 2010; and after a period with Hopeless Records are currently signed to Rise Records.

For Rey, she could be corrupted by the issue of her identity or something since the writers made her parents a red herring (so who IS she?). Also with her being a mary sue, why should she have to carry the resistance to victory when she can do pretty much everything, sort of a jab to the creators for making her what she is.

As for Kylo, he did idolize Anakin so finding his path to the light side would be a good homage for what Anakin did in RotJ. It could be played out that the resistance became even worse than the First Order due to corruption in the upper ranks (probably led by Rey) and those who chose to oppose it would have to settle their differences with former enemies and work together to beat this new threat.

http://thealternativehypothesis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-FOR-RYAN.pdf

Mirror:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Bg5TZSwX4SfQ7BPEEUQc2Ap6RodYg2j

The PDF raises many points about the JQ that show that the current tendency moving in favorable directions. Less Jewish ethnocentrism, more alignment with whites on political issues, pendulum swinging back towards conservatism and right wing political views. 

The PDF omits from analysis facts like the recent collapse of the Socialists / Labor party in Israel - who lost 50% of their Parliamentary seats a decade earlier, and never recovered. The failure of the peace process with the Arabs, and the accompanying terrorism has resulted in a shift to the right. Secular Zionist Jews are at war against the Ex-Jewish Marxists in Europe and the USA. 

There is a reason Netanyahu keeps getting re-elected despite massive flow of funds from Soros into left-wing organizations.
https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-blames-Soros-for-Israel-anti-deportation-campaign-540640

These are two clearly distinguishable opposing factions that cannot be treated as a monolith group. This rift extends into the USA, and any analysis should recognize the differences. 

Problem Two:

What other religious and ethnic group survived in Christian Europe? Alt-Hype repeatedly claims that the Jews being chased away from every country is evidence of wrongdoing, yet fails to compare to any other group.

Europe during the middle ages and until the start of classic liberalism was almost entirely Christian, and with warfare between different branches. 

For example: When Russia adopted the Orthodox Christianity, the government persecuted and chased out any stubborn adherents of the old faith ""Starovertsy"". 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Believers

Mere differences in how they pray and in which sequence they perform the cross sign resulted in massive ""pogroms"" of the Old Believers, chasing the few survivors away from population centers. 

Western Europe was not much better considering the Catholic Inquisitors would terrorize the entire continent, burning anyone accused of heresy, and any Jew caught within their sphere of political influence who did not convert or adhere to very specific and strict restrictions. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition

The Spanish inquisition targeted any large group that could be suspected of disloyalty to the crown. 

This included the Jewish converts to Christianity: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Expulsion_of_Jews._Jewish_conversos

This included the Muslim converts:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos_and_Morisco_conversos

The main reason other faiths were not affected was simply because they did not exist in large numbers in Spain at the time. 

The reasons for the inquisition movements themselves are many, and they are largely not focused on the Jews. They seem a part of a general political struggle and warfare against Muslim and Ottoman empires, and against other branches of Christianity. 

Jews did not need to be nefarious or have a corrupting influence to result in an eventual expulsion - all they had to do was be a separate political entity that did not fit under the strict hierarchy demanded by the Theocratic State. 

The surprising fact is not that Jews were expelled from multiple Christian countries, but that they survived at all in such a hostile environment and without an empire to fall back on or return to like the Muslims or Turks. 

Problem Three: 

https://jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/

Alt-Hype knew about Jordan Peterson's response to the JQ, and decided to not to engage in that debate, despite an elaboration being posted on April 24, 2018, and provided statistical reference.

Alt-Hype could have included references to this rebuttal of Kevin MacDonalds that was linked by Peterson: 

https://philarchive.org/archive/COFJAA
____

I have to say I was not entirely surprised by the release of the video considering the overall trend of /pol/ and Youtube commentary in recent years - a downward spiral towards InfoWars level controlled opposition and blind acceptance of falsified research.

Why should Alt-Hype engage in an intellectual debate with key arguments and participants in the debate when he can pretend they do not exist, tabulate only the data that supports his favored position, and appease the more radical wing of supporters?

If the goal was honestly the preservation of Western and European culture, then the positive contributions of Jews to that culture throughout history and in the present would have been represented.

Focusing solely on the Jews that oppose your movement (with an obvious historical reason) completely ignores the existence of a growing minority of Jews that support western culture and reject the Marxists. 

For illustration, here are a few videos of European culture in the heart of Judaism, Israel:

Israeli Opera since 2000's has been staging some of the biggest productions of Western European classics. 

For example - Giuseppe Verdi's AIDA:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbMG7GwODk0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7cf0KMjzII

Giacomo Puccini's Tosca:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYR-uwyfLsY

Carmen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqWL9M3PUE

When you look at the deeds of these people, they are promoting Western Culture in the most direct way possible. They perform art in the classical tradition, keeping the culture alive and bringing it to new generations. 

If you ask the same people a political question unrelated to their direct profession, you may get a dumbass hypocritical and inconsiderate answer. They exist in their own bubble controlled by the same type of leftists news propaganda that became dominant in the USA. 

That reality of 1990's and 2000's is now slowly shifting back towards the right - politically at first, but now increasingly in the shifting media, and very rapidly on the internet. The leftists elites are not only losing in the USA, but also in a similar way in Israel.

There are only two groups of people interested in marginalizing this historical shift - Leftists ""Soros Shills"" who want to scare Jews away from a shift to the Right (""there be Nazis!""), and the kind of tactical profiteers within the Alt-Right that see competitive advantage in edginess.

&gt;The United States had gone to war declaring it must destroy an active weapons of mass destruction program. Instead, American troops gradually found and ultimately suffered from the remnants of long-abandoned programs, built in close collaboration with the West.

&gt;The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government’s invasion rationale.

&gt;Others pointed to another embarrassment. In five of six incidents in which troops were wounded by chemical agents, the munitions appeared to have been designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies.

In Japan, Shueisha (the publisher) holds the license to the series. The reason MHA figures aren't being made by anyone outside Banpresto (and formerly GSC, although it seems they lost the license), is almost definitely on the Shueisha end.

Licensing deals for Japanese toy companies don't go through Funimation. Funimation is based out of the US, and only licenses things for international distribution and production in the US, Canada, and parts of Europe. This means that Funko's license has no bearing on the production of MHA figures outside America, and likely wouldn't even have bearing on the production of MHA figures in America because they don't have a master license (which would grant them the exclusive right to MHA figures).

Opinions have power, no matter what you do. The only option you have is to *change* that opinion. Like I said earlier, scientific studies have shown if you are confrontational about it, the people will become even more fervent.

&gt;lack of intelligence and education is the issue.

This is... generally incorrect. As a country, the US is ""tied"" for ninth in IQ alongside mostly European countries like Germany, so we do alright.

Lack of education is an interesting one. I think the way we educate the *young* in this country (which I think is what you were saying) is completely wrong. Lack of education wouldn't be as big of an issue if we at least taught them properly for k-12. Universities are a crapshoot based on which school you attend and your major. 

&gt;I am all for debating people with logic to prove a point but you can't convince someone who doesn't rely on logic.

This is where we disagree. You can! I have to do it all the time in my line of work. I'm a lawyer. I have to convince people to take settlements or plea deals they don't want to, normally for emotional reasons. If I just sat there and told them how logical the decision is, it wouldn't be nearly as effective. I also can't call them idiots for thinking about the other options etc. It takes a bit of diplomacy, but it's always worth it.

I wish both sides in the US were a little more diplomatic about their approach to these debates, it would go a long way towards opening up an honest rapport between everyone.

And like you said (btw, I don't mind your tone, it's fine), the internet has made things even more inflammatory. People feel much more comfortable slinging harsh insults with the relative anonymity of the web to protect them. Any dumbass with a youtube channel can spout inflammatory rhetoric to potentially millions of people. The problem with the ""information age"" is nobody verifies if the information being spread around is true or not.

Not OP, but I've always found this kind of an odd stance for people to hold. Like, scientifically? Sure. Realistically? We all have a pretty good understanding of what these terms mean in terms of appearance most of the time. The idea that cops are unfairly targeting black men, for example, is predicated on the idea a ""black"" person can be easily distinguished from non-black people, which is generally true. 

&gt;Like, no one is telling you to not be attracted to some people or to be attracted to some others. What we're saying is that racial preferences aren't hard-wired into our brain because race is not really a meaningful way to categorize human beings. So the origin must be something else.

As for this, we are in some sense hardwired to prefer, feel more empathy towards, identify, etc. people of our ingroup. The fact that our most recent European iterations of what it means to be a ""group"" (race) aren't really very supported by science doesn't mean we haven't evolved over a gazillion years to prefer dealing with people who look, speak, think, believe, and act like we do.

Automotive, Aerospace, Metallurgy, Agrochemical and Petrochemical (particularly plastic polymers production) and Textiles are doing fairly well last time I checked. Farming and the food industry in general are also quite strong, with a focus on quality rather than quantity. Pharmaceuticals are doing somewhat good too. The financial sector is not a good place to work, if you ask me, but it is going strong in Milan, right along Fashion and Design, and tends to offer higher than average income.

&gt; Is there a place for a chemist there?

Definitely yes. I think Confidustria (a national confederation of most industries category associations) is actually complaining about the shortage of qualified personnel in some ""technical"" sectors and Chemistry is one of them. Expect an income that is lower than what you are used to (yes, this is probably the cause for the shortage in the first place).

&gt; What is the best place to work, socialize, and ski?

All three of them together? Probably Milan, Turin or some other northern city that is fairly close to the Alps and has ski clubs you can join. It really depends on how much weight you think the three elements should have, relative to each other.

&gt; Do ski slopes require tickets?

The slopes themselves rarely, but access to most lifts will require a ticket or a pass. I used to ski a lot in the three valleys of the [Monterosa Ski resort](https://www.dovesciare.it/sites/default/files/skimap-monterosaski_0.jpg) and they used this RFID plastic card you could ""recharge"" at the ticket booths for access to some or all the lifts, depending on which valleys/slopes you wanted to ski in and for how many days. The costlier pass is equivalent to 15 daily passes (to spend whenever you want all over the season) accessing all of the lifts in all three valleys and is around 490 euros. Food and beverages are not included: you'll find a lot of nice places to eat or drink a hot chocolate or a ""bombardino"" near the slopes or in the small towns in the valleys.

&gt; What are the skiing seasons?

Well, it depends. These last few years, the ski seasons have been shorter than normal but a few years ago I remember skiing on the Monterosa from the second week of December up to the second week of March. Best month IMHO was February. Most resorts today will compensate for the high temperatures we have seen in these last years by spraying artificial snow and open the slopes nonetheless.",True,False,0,1525253924,,False,0,dybdz2q,False,t3_8gance,True,t1_dyazrrn,/r/italy/comments/8gance/no_stupid_questions_italy_edition/dybdz2q/,,1526983325,2,False,True,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of color, with some particular exceptions. Jewish people were to be exterminated in the Holocaust, along with Romani people, and the physically and mentally disabled According to the Generalplan Ost, the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder in the Holocaust, with a majority expelled to Asia and used as slave labor in the Reich.

An economic forecast based on a scenario that never actually occurred? Classic [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism). Don't forget what was said on the other side.

&gt;You as a voter have to be the jury and work out who is telling the lies.

That depends on the public's ability to do that, and [this suggests that their ability is not very good.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nearly-half-of-britons-believe-vote-leaves-false-350-million-a-week-to-the-eu-claim-a7085016.html) Campaigns should be factual and the voters informed for a democracy to function - your definition puts North Korea as a democracy since they should know they've been lied to.

&gt;You don't call a miss trial because lies were told in court.

This made me laugh. **Yes, you do.** You're entitled to a retrial with the proper facts and whoever told those lies can also be charged with Perjury which has a maximum 7 year prison sentence. False convictions are overturned all the time.

&gt;So long as the electoral commission declared it a free and fair vote the vote counts.

The electoral commission make no such declarations. They release a report, which I assume you haven't read, and investigate any wrongdoing. Considering that there is still multiple ongoing investigations into Vote Leave and Arron Banks, maybe reconsider using the electoral commission in your arguments for the time being to remain factual.

All you've said is that you live in Europe, but your posting history includes Dutch so you're probably in the Netherlands or Belgium. It looks like anywhere in the region you're less than an hour away from a kite store.  

KiteLife forums have [a useful map](https://kitelife.com/forum/membermap/) of kite flyers around the world. Again assuming Netherlands, you might get in touch with their user SKS65 who seems active on the forums and might let you talk him in to trying out some gear.

&gt;  not too difficult to learn but still hard to master and something that doesn't pull too hard since I am kind of small. ... the prism synapse 170. I am not sure if a foil kite is a good idea for me though as I am kind of small and dont weigh alot.

Your other posts mention both the Synapse and the Symphony 1.8.

Both are good beginner kites. Both will have some pull, though. 

The Prism Synapse 170 is a beginner kite because it is durable and relatively easy to fly, but it is a speed foil so it is harder to control and has a pretty good tug. For some videos, I searched YouTube for ""Prism Synapse 170"" and found some good examples of the pull with [this video of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1eMLes0KG8) or [this review](https://youtu.be/ebKHLlzuXP0?t=67) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n364LanC2cE). I don't know how big you are with ""kind of small"", but if you're under about 60 kg a speed kite kite can pull you around at the field in gusts or in the middle of the wind window.

The Symphony is classed as a power kite, but is also a good beginner kite. I haven't flown it, but they look a little slower but with plenty of pull. Again, if you're under 60 kg you're likely to get pulled around the field, or at least get an upper body workout.

You might consider the smaller versions of each, the Synapse 140 or the Symphony 1.3. Both will have less pull, are durable, and both are rather fast.

&gt; a good amount of control over the kite ... a cool stunt kite of some sort ...  I don't live in an area close to the beach, so most of my training will be quite far landinwards, but am planning on bringing it with me when I go on vacation

Both the Synapse and the Symphony are fast. They'll meet your need for being durable, but they won't do the cool stunts.

If you're considering a sparred kite that is beginner friendly and slower than those two kites, and can do the ""cool stunts"", there is a kite called [the Beetle](http://intothewind.com/Item--i-7867) with a reputation of being nearly indestructible. The kite is slower, and under lighter winds it can do many of the beginner tricks like axels and fades and pancakes.

Eu não sei até onde concordo com isso... A classe média já está, por definição, em uma posição financeira relativamente ""confortável"". Por mais que sua definição de classe média varie da minha, com certeza não estão passando necessidades básicas ou desabrigados. Portanto, na minha opinião, nós devemos sim focar nos que estão em situações mais desesperadas, sem residência e mal conseguindo se alimentar, que ainda são muitos no Brasil.

Sua definição desse ""encargo"" que cai na classe média difere da minha, eu acho, já que, se pensarmos em termos de impacto na qualidade de vida, os mais pobres são os que mais pagam o custo da nossa sociedade/economia, já que ocupam a posição (inerente ao capitalismo) da base da pirâmide, e, portanto, merecem maior apoio do Estado.

A não ser que você pense pela lógica (no mínimo, distorcida) de que quem é pobre é porque ""não fez por merecer"", ou não se esforçou o suficiente para ""subir na vida"". Aí realmente seria injusto a classe média ter que sustentar essas pessoas com seus impostos. Mas, como eu disse, a realidade não é essa, já que é simplesmente impossível uma sociedade capitalista sem os miseráveis, sem falar em toda a história das condições desiguais de competição etc etc etc.

Enfim, basicamente eu acho que o peso que recai sobre a classe média, por maior que seja, não chega perto do peso que é a miséria.

An unemployed person is defined by Eurostat, according to the guidelines of the International Labour Organization, as someone aged 15 to 74 without work during the reference week who is available to start work within the next two weeks and who has actively sought employment at some time during the last four weeks. The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.

In addition to the unemployment measures covered here, Eurostat also publishes statistics for persons who fulfil only partially the definition of unemployment. These persons are not included in the official ILO unemployment concept and have a varying degree of attachment to the labour market. The indicators on underemployment and potential additional labour force participants supplement the unemployment rate to provide a more complete picture of the labour market.

There is currently no specific legal basis for producing and disseminating monthly unemployment data. However, these monthly data are estimates based on results of the European Union Labour force survey (EU LFS), which is a continuous household survey carried out in all Member States in accordance with European legislation and on the basis of harmonised definitions. These results are interpolated/extrapolated to monthly data using national survey data and/or national monthly series on registered unemployment. The quarterly LFS results are always used as a benchmark to ensure international comparability. As for most Member States the results from the LFS for a full quarter are available 90 days after the end of the reference period, the most recent figures are usually provisional. For many countries monthly unemployment data are calculated by Eurostat, while several countries actually supply those figures directly from the LFS.",True,False,0,1525267202,,False,0,dybm3lo,False,t3_8ggi1a,False,t1_dyblnta,/r/europe/comments/8ggi1a/unemployment_rate_in_eu_member_states_in_march/dybm3lo/,,1526987759,9,False,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

False,ZeroCorpse,,,,"First off, Paelleon wasn't too bad when he wasn't just being a standard Imperial sycophant. I like Thrawn, and Rukh was good, too. However, Zahn and Filoni have improved both of the latter two immensely in the new canon, so as far as I'm concerned the best two parts of the original Zahn trilogy was already incorporated into canon properly.

As for ""what Star Wars do (I) love?"" -- If you mean the EU, not a lot. Not love, anyway. I hate KotoR. The NJO was incredibly awful. The Yuuzhan Vong are horrid. Jaina ""Sword of the Jedi"" Solo and her dead brothers were all pretty terrible. Chewbacca's fate is pathetic. Kyle Katarn was two-dimensional. Most of the video games had weak plots and contrived characters that were ridiculously over-the-top because they had to serve as player proxies.

Most of the EU was fine when we didn't have any other Star Wars... And then the prequels, Clone Wars, and subsequent films and shows happened. 

So what Star Wars do I love? The canon Star Wars. The movies. The shows. The current crop of novels and comic books. The ones that aren't just fanfic that got a low-grade C-canon or S-canon in the old system. 

Lucas said it best:
&gt; *""There are two worlds here,"" explained Lucas. ""There's my world, which is the movies, and there's this other world that has been created, which I say is the parallel universe—the licensing world of the books, games and comic books. They don't intrude on my world, which is a select period of time, [but] they do intrude in between the movies. I don't get too involved in the parallel universe.""*

I see the Legends stuff as a parallel universe, or just a series of fictional tales told *in* the canon universe. It's material that contradicts itself constantly, and it seems like the EU writers spent an amazing amount of time trying to one-up each other, retcon each others' writing, and flatly ignoring other elements of the EU. 

Take for example Karen Traviss, who spent the better part of her time in the Legacy of the Force series doing seemingly *everything* she could to undermine the character development of other authors who wrote books in that series. It was supposed to be a series about the rise and fall of Darth Caedus, about how powerful Jacen had become, about Jaina's duty to end his reign of terror, and when it came time for Traviss' input into the series she spent the entire time promoting her Mandalorian characters and books (which were terrible and had Mandalorians all wrong, by the way), and doing everything in her power to make the Jedi and Sith look extremely weak in the face of run-of-the-mill Mandalorians. With her entry into the series, the whole story came crumbling down and hit a full stop... And this sort of thing was common in the EU. Every series had something like this happen. Every big series had one author playing against another author's ideas in what seemed like a competitive, messy, ""My book is better than your book"" kind of way, and it made the whole thing feel sour and unpleasant. Meanwhile, Traviss' contributions to the EU were so bad that George Lucas himself stepped in and had The Clone Wars retcon it all right out of existence. 

Compare that to the current canon. The Star Wars Story Group has tighter control, and doesn't let Karen Traviss situations happen. The stories all work *together* instead of against each other. 

So what do I love in Star Wars?  All nine main movies, Rogue One, Rebels, The Clone Wars, the new novels (including Zahn's excellent ""Thrawn"", which gives the character a lot more depth and development than the original Thrawn trilogy ever did), the new comics (especially Vader, which really does a great job with the character), and the things that are being gently and carefully guided by the Star Wars Story Group so that they don't end up with authors backstabbing each other in an attempt to make their pet character the most noticeable and powerful. 

I'm a fan. I'm actually a huge fan and have been since I was nearly 8 years old in that theater watching Star Wars-- the original Star Wars-- for the first time. I enjoyed having some Star Wars when there were no movies, but the EU books, games, and comics were all the wild west of Star Wars. There was no law. There was no guidance. There was also a lot of respect missing between creators.

I'm a fan of Star Wars; Not the unchecked fan fiction Expanded Universe that grew up in the absence of first-party materials. 

I cheered when they announced the EU was being shelved and that they'd mine it for good parts to inject back into canon. That was the best decision they ever made. They've done an excellent job pulling only the good stuff out of the EU and developing it in canon. They've done an even better job keeping the stuff that doesn't belong in Star Wars *out*.

O Neymar eu coloquei como exemplo para demonstrar que renda é renda.  Se um jogador de futebol, um executivo de alto escalão, ou um dono de empresa recebe, digamos, 1 milhão em um ano, não há porque diferenciar as taxas de impostos dos mesmos.  Ou seja, imposto de renda deve ser sobre a renda da pessoa, não importando se é salário, dividendos, ganhos de capital, etc.

Mas nos acabamos nos desviando muito do assunto da discussão inicial.  Meu ponto principal era que, se não fossem as distorções geradas pelo próprio governo, haveria pouca diferença entre empresas pequenas e empresas grandes.  Além disso, nas situações em que empresas grandes teriam sim uma vantagem, isso não é necessariamente ruim para a economia.  Sem a intervenção estatal, as empresas crescem até o tamanho de sua eficiencia, e isso é salutar para a sociedade.  É melhor ter, por exemplo, uma grande distribuidora de água potável, ou grandes fabricantes de automóveis do que uma infinidadede de pequenas empresas dessas áreas.

O que o pessoal tem medo infundado é do espantalho que a empresa grande vai comprar as pequenas e aumentar o preço dos produtos ""trocentos"" porcento.  Se a empresa grande fizer isso, novas empresas pequenas vão surgir.  Se a empresa grande continuar comprando as pequenas, vai surgir um modelo de negócio de fazer empresa pequena e vender para as grandes (o que alias é exatamente o que os inúmeros IPOs fazem [IPOs que raramente acontecem no Brasil, devido entre outras coisas a jabuticaba da não existencia de empresa com capital limitado para fins de justiça tributária e trabalhista que citei acima]).

False,CaptnCheerio,,,,"&gt; Could these three all survive in healthy numbers based off the herbivores I listed? I don't think so. Large animals like camels would be needed for cats to maintain stable populations there.

What leads you to believe that? Is it just a gut instinct? It doesn't matter if there is only 1 species of prey animal as long as there is enough of that 1 species. Introducing camels would likely not have a significant impact on predator diet anyway because 95% of what a predator eats isn't large game. Camels are dangerous, cats know camels are dangerous, they're typically not going to go after them as long as there is a better option. Introducing a smaller animal would be more likely to impact big cat's diets.

I'm not necessarily opposed to reintroducing the dromedary camel, I don't know enough about it to feel strongly one way or the other. The point of what I'm saying is that the decline of the dromedary camel/Asiatic water buffalo isn't what lead to the decline in big cat species - it's hunting and habitat loss. So if one of the main arguments to reintroduce those animals is to provide a better food source for large cats, then that argument is almost null. 

&gt;Well, the wild Asiatic water buffalo is pretty endangered and concentrated in a single spot. Allowing predators to attack them would put the existence of their species' survival in jeopardy.

&gt;Is there any way to rewild domesticated buffaloes without mixing them? Like maybe back breeding them or something like how they're doing with the aurochs? Wouldn't it be easier to do it with domesticated buffaloes since they look almost identical to their wild cousins?    

Again, a primary part of your argument was to 'rewild' the Asiatic water buffalo to give large prey animals a food source. If we're actually working on conservation efforts to save the Asiatic water buffalo, rather than just try to come up with something similar from domestic stock (which isn't rewilding), then it's going to be a long time before those animals are populous enough to serve as a food source. 

Why would we be trying to create feral, which is the actual word you're looking for in this case - not rewilding, water buffalo that would only create competition for the actual wild water buffalo native to that area. It doesn't matter if they look similar, they've been domesticated for quite some time - they're not wild, any effort dedicated to this would be better spent trying to save the population of actual wild water buffalo in the area.


The auroch project is basically someone's science fair project. They're just scientists with grant money trying to bring back an extinct species. This isn't rewilding, this is 'de-extinction'. IF they are able to reintroduce them to areas, it's going to be the Yellowstone Wolf Project all over again. Aurochs, which seem to be described as 'fearsome', will have to live in a small controlled area. They won't ever be roaming the European countryside freely in herds. It's not possible considering the amount of growth Europe has seen since the 1600s when the auroch went extinct. Farmers don't want some ornery auroch bull busting their fences to breed their dairy cow. Hikers don't to get gored when they accidentally wander up on one. I'd say the chance of aurochs being successfully brought back and reintroduced is slim at best. 

Adding to that, here's a scientist weighing on back breeding:

&gt;“Back-breeding is a fairly crude way of developing an aurochslike animal,” says David MacHugh, a geneticist at University College Dublin.  

If they had a live auroch to work with, I'm sure they'd be all over breeding from that - but they don't so they're making do. We have wild Asiatic water buffalo, so why would it make sense to limit ourselves to back breeding from a domestic species?

&gt; Just looked that up. I'm pretty confused. Here is info on the incident: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mule-vs-mountain-lion/

&gt;The top of the link states the mule killed the cougar and the bottom says that it attacked an already dead cougar. Very interesting and surprising to me if it killed the cougar.

&gt;Do you know how common it is for cougars to interact with equines? Are they ever hunted by cougars?

I'm talking about first hand accounts of people who literally lived off the back of the horse and packed mules in the most remote area in the continental US for years. This was happening in the 2000's but they were out there living the 1800s. Mules are known to go after wolves, stand ground with grizzlies and lions. They're very different from a horse - and they get that personality from the donkey side of their genetics. 

Lions and horses definitely interact. Lions will kill horses, obviously only the domesticated horses are getting reported as 'killed by lion' but they seem to go after older or smaller horses that are being kept by themselves or with one other horse in a paddock. There is definitely safety in numbers. Wildlife Management Officials describe attacks on horses as 'very rare'. 

Going back to my back country ranger friends, they kept large herds of horses on free range in mountain lion territory and never lost one to a lion.

&gt; If domesticated horses are well adapted, then how come European rewilding projects are trying to breed them back like how they are doing with the aurochs?

That is someone's science fair project. They're doing it because they want to, it doesn't have anything to do with the ability of our modern domesticated horse to adapt. They can't create a wild horse anyway, because there are no truly wild horses left in the world - they all broke off from a domestic ancestor. I'm sure they could have turned Icelandic horses loose in Poland and had the same result, but they wanted to try to recreate the Tarpan.

Depression is on the rise, and 75 percent of all new cases are female, suicide is on the rise (the majority of attempts are female), single motherhood has skyrocketed and the majority of rapists and woman beaters are the products of single mothers, the ""feminist"" government of Sweden has said the rise in rape reports is a good thing because theyre being reported, the birth rate is dropping like a rock, promiscuity and STD's are on the rise, and the hook up culture has put society in this weird sex-obsessed yet sex-deprived state with all of the negatives but no benefits

Feminism for the past few years has NOT been about equality, its been about special treatment. Lower standards for the same jobs in the military, extended test times for women at Oxford in math exams, pushing for economic equality when men make up the majority of workplace deaths and applicants for higher paying jobs (especially in the tech industry), and telling women that theyre beautiful and amazing and any guy who says otherwise is an asshole even if they're 200lbs and have kids. 

Feminists love to criticize the west but refuse to criticize cultures like, and especially, Islam. The majority of Islamic converts in Europe have been women, marrying a muslim man who probably has other wives. The sad truth is that women and men arent the same and to pretend they are has had so many negative repercussions.

A move which would likely do more damage to wildlife, do lasting damage to the land both chemically (e.g. poured concrete) and aesthetically as well as increasing the cost of of food both to the consumer and the farmer.

&gt;or start raising dogs with their livestock

So they should have to invest time and money into a dog that would have to fight the wolves, likely leading to an injury of both animals? The farmer would then have to pay for the vet bills and the wolf will likely die in the wild anyway because of it's injuries.

&gt;I would find shooting wolves acceptable if their population was out of control

I agree that it is a shame that this one was shot but I would argue that one of the main reasons wolves went extinct in that area (and most of Europe) is because of their incompatibility with agriculture, and the lack of remaining wild land. Having any number of wolves roam freely around agricultural land is, by definition, a population out of control.

Again it's easy to dictate to people what they should have to live with when you're not experiencing it yourself and, whilst I agree we need to make a concerted effort to protect species from extinction, we need to find a solution that allows the animals enough natural land to exist without infringing upon humans.

But with the Nokia branding, the camera performance, removable batteries, sensible pricing, a stable OS, and growing convergences between phone and pc (Cortana/ continuum/ one drive etc), they could have retained at least a fighting chance.

We were constantly texting and we would say how much we love eachother. We also talked about how we've never had such a strong connection so fast and could hang out and talk for hours. I really loved him and I would have done anything for him. After awhile , it became harder to make plans with him. Even if he made plans they usually ended up being cancelled. One time I even talked to him about how it bothers me when he cancels an hour before and the reason wouldn't even be that good. Example: ""Im so sorry! I can't go anymore because I'm playing basketball and the guys wanna play all day. "" He said he understood and he would change. He didn't. We stopped texting and snap chatting all the time and he would barely ever ask me to hang out. If he did he would cancel. He would say he was busy with work or school but I would see Snapchats of him with his other friends. I eventually stopped trying to hang out with him but kept up hope things would change in the summer. I told him in march how I wanna see him before I go on my trip to Europe in May. He said that's silly ! Of course he will see me before then. Then last week we made plans for Friday figuring that's the only day we could hang out.  Friday afternoon I texted him and said hey do you still wanna hang out tonight? And he replied I can't :( the girl I've been seeing is super clingy and wants me to spend the night with her. I told him that I would see him when I got back. Then he replied he was so bummed he didn't get to see me before I left. That got me so pissed because it was his choice so I blocked him on everything. I didn't want to bother him anymore and I didn't want to get excited to see him when it wouldn't happen. Also I doubt the girl was ""clingy"". She probably just asked him to hang out and he said sure! I think about him everyday and miss him so much but I doubt he even has noticed yet that I blocked him. It really sucks when you care about someone and you realize they don't care about you at all. I will always cherish the friendship I had with him for awhile. I wonder what I did wrong. 

Sorry for this long post. I'm just sad about it and needed to vent. It was a hard realization to know he didn't care about our friendship or me.

Then there's probably no reason to continue.

A more obvious example is the ""blackface"" thing considered super racist in the US while it's not in Europe. A famous French footballer dressed up as his idol for some event. His idol was a black basket player and people lost their shit because he blackfaced or whatever it's called, not understanding that in France, Spain or whereever there's nothing racist about it. It was a tribute. Blackface has two completely different meanings in the US and in Europe. 

While the n word doesn't have completely different meanings, it is still on different spots of the spectrum of a bad word in US compared to Europe. Or especially in Asia where such slave history didn't give it the meaning it got in the US.

It's not that difficult to understand. Words don't mean the same everywhere. A liberal in Denmark is a socialist in the US.

False,eaglewatch1945,,,,"Every shoe manufactured starts with a last--a mold around which the upper and insole of the shoe is wrapped. Every different style has a different last. Every last has a different shape. Some lasts allow for a wider toe box. Some for a higher instep. Some are a very trim fit. 

Oftentimes a manufacturer (typically for men's shoes) will create a line that uses the same last for different looks. Ex. Florsheim has the Midtown line that features wingtips, cap toes, monk straps, and loafers that will all fit the same.

As far as US sizing goes, the unit of measure is the barleycorn which is 1/3 of an inch between whole sizes (1/6 between half sizes.) This is more than enough to ensure proper length; however, your feet have 2 lengths: foot length (heel to longest toe) and arch length (heel to ball.) A Brannock device measures both sizes and you should lean towards the larger of the two as your size. The arch length is *usually* the longer of the measurements and the most accurate size to get a well-fitting shoe. It allows proper arch support and more importantly prevents toes from cramming together or rubbing against the upper. The ol' ""thumbs width"" check is only useful in fitting kids' shoes.

Now widths are trickier as your dealing with more variables. The rule of thumb is you get an extra 1/4 inch diameter for every letter width a last goes up. In men's shoes you have B (very narrow) to D (medium) to 5E (very, very wide.) Shoe manufacturers aren't going to make 8 different width lasts for one size, so you get narrow (B,) medium (D,) and wide (EE or EEE.) Of course, an oxford EEE will not be as wide as a derby EEE because an oxford uses a trimmer last than a derby.

There's also the materials to consider. Suede and nubuck are soft and supple. Pebble grain breaks in faster. Smooth leather is stiffer. Man-made uppers are plastic and will do your feet no favors. What are the lining and sock liner (insert) like? How thick are they?

Regarding European and American sizing, keep in mind that an American company is designing its shoes in barleycorns and simply converting the size after the fact, and a European company is doing the same.

Keys to success:

* Get your feet measured by a professional shoe salesperson every 5 years or so (our feet change just like the rest of our bodies.)

* Try on your shoes with your normal socks at the end of a busy day. 

* Be mindful of your little toe when trying on shoes. It feeling crammed is the best indicator that a shoe that might seem okay in foot length is too small.

* Stay away from man-made uppers. ",True,False,0,1525275128,,False,0,dybub3i,False,t3_8gglwi,False,t3_8gglwi,/r/LifeProTips/comments/8gglwi/lpt_tired_of_getting_the_wrong_size_shoe_because/dybub3i/,,1526992289,9,False,True,False,LifeProTips,t5_2s5oq,public,

**He never *claimed* to see him. It doesn't matter if he saw him or not. Also, I misspoke. It was Genghis Khan who was disappointed to find that his son Kublai Khan did not inherit his red hair.**

2) Your ancestors were also Caucasian Indo-Iranians and Indo Europeans. The evidence found in that paper is the strongest evidence of Genghis Khan's lineage and it does fit with the descriptions of Genghis Khan. Quoting the paper itself:

&gt;Although many regard the portrait at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, as the depiction most closely resembles Genghis Khan, all existing portraits, including this one, are essentially arbitrary interpretations of Genghis Khan’s appearance by historians living generations after Genghis Khan’s era [2, 6]. Although the factual nature of the statement is controversial, Persian historian Rashid-al-Din reported in his “Jami’s al-tawarikh” written at the start of the 14th century that most Borjigin ancestors of Genghis Khan were tall, long-bearded, red-haired, and bluish green-eyed, suggesting that the Genghis Khan’s male lineage had some Caucasoid-specific genetic features [44]. He also said that Genghis Khan looked just like his ancestors, but Kublai Khan, his grandson, did not inherit his ancestor’s red hair, implying that the addition of Mongoloid-specific alleles for determining hair color to the genetic makeup of Genghis Khan’s Borjigin clan was probably from the grandmother or mother of Kublai Khan, that is, the wife or daughter-in-law of Genghis Khan.

&gt; Sabaton is a symphonic power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts. In April 2012, four members left the band and formed another, whilst vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members.

&gt; Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.

&gt; In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.

&gt; The band returned for a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.

&gt; Their third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like ""Back in Control"" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), ""Attero Dominatus"" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and ""Angels Calling"" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.

&gt; In March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song ""Birds of War"".

&gt; As a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles ""Cliffs of Gallipoli"" and ""Ghost Division"".

&gt; In September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.

&gt; The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War ""White Death"". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.

&gt; On March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found, Sabaton used digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.

&gt; Following the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage, ""Carolus Rex,"" the first single for the album of the same name (Carolus Rex), was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world tour headlined as ""The Swedish Empire Tour"". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.

&gt; ""Carolus Rex"" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album was made available in both Swedish and English versions.

&gt; Regarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented: ""It appears to be sudden, but it had actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...""

&gt; The former members of Sabaton have since formed a new band called ""Civil War"", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.

&gt; In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. With Snowy Shaw replacing him as touring drummer.

&gt; In November 2013, it was announced that Sabaton would be touring North America with Iced Earth for six weeks in the spring of 2014. Robban Bäck has also left the band and been replaced with Hannes van Dahl of Evergrey.

&gt; In January 2014, the band announced the cover of their new album called ""Heroes,"" due to be released on May 16 2014. The album proved to be a hit and made #1 on the official Swedish album chart. On 27 January the band was announced to play Download Festival in June.

&gt; Thobbe Englund left Sabaton as guitarist with release of their new album ""The Last Stand"" on 19th August 2016 to ""expand his own creativeness in combination with a somewhat stiller life, where he will not tour all year round at the speed of light"" as he said himself.

Life expectancy is not calculated the same from one country to another.  

One of the biggest driving factors for life expectancy is the way infant deaths are accounted for.  The United States adheres to the WHO definition of ""live birth"" (any infant “irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which . . . breathes or shows any other evidence of life . . . whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached”).  Many Western European nations do not adhere to this definition.

Infant mortality also varies significantly across ethnic groups.  The United States is far more ethnically diverse than any Western European nation, including the UK.  Infant mortality rates, for whatever reason, are higher among ethnic minorities in the US and in Europe.  But there is a far higher proportion of ethnic minorities living in the US.

Life expectancy is also a poor measure of quality of healthcare.  People die for all sorts of reasons that are wholly unrelated to the quality of medical care available where they live.  I would expect that American teenagers, for example, are far more likely to die in car accidents than German teenagers.  Why? Because licenses are given out at age 16 in the US and for far less money.  In Germany, the minimum driving age is 18, and licensing costs thousands.

I would expect that a population which drives more than walking or biking would be at a higher risk of dying simply due to traffic fatalities.  I would also expect a more sedentary population to be at a higher risk of dying than a more active population.  Neither of these things has anything to do with the quality of medical care available.

Naturally, the NHS is going to spend less per patient: resources are being deliberately rationed.

All we know of Mbappe is that he's a stunning footballer, played for Monaco and left without acrimony.

Leon Bailey's ascent to football stardom has been unconventional. He wasn't scooped up by a top academy when ye was 10 years old. His step dad took him from Jamaica and they wandered around Europe doing trials for many teams until his talent became known.

We have a LOT of remote, rural space that up until very recently, was quite sheltered from a lot of the nation.

Smaller thinking in smaller places. You get the most progress in cities because people are exposed to a LOT of different cultures (both national and international) and change.

The US is behind on a lot of issues because much of America has defined itself by that midwestern and southern lifestyle that has changed less in comparison to the rapidly evolving cultures found in dense population centres. Small, rural places are not only exposed to less change, but have a tendency to react with a certain level of disapproval towards the notion of any major changes or disruptions to tradition and the status quo. Throw in that element of religion and it really just amplifies the stubbourness you find because many people who fall into that small-town thinking are outright hostile towards change. The bible belt itself is obviously the most extreme example because that whole added bonus of slavery and the subsequent Civil War left the entire region locked in a VERY bitter and outright malicious state of mind. The national systematic oppression of minorities is a pretty big ode to the fact that a lot of shit didn't disappear after slavery was ended-- it just changed form.

It's always going to be a combination of poverty, education, importance of religion, geography, and global exposure (ie. WWII brought a lot of change because a fuck ton of people traveled from their tiny home towns to the other side of the world and were exposed to new cultures).


It's actually a super interesting sort of thing to observe with this country. I used to work for a company that makes a machine product that did very, very well here. They made an upgraded version that absolutely took off in Europe but did terribly in the US despite being a REALLY good version of that product. Turns out the US has a huge issue with the whole ""cowboy"" mindset in that people here fucking hate change and are stubbourn asses about it. They literally redesigned the face of the console controls to be very similar to the one before that and suddenly the product sold like hot-cakes. The entire issue was around the mere fact that the layout of the console had changed.

*  *UC1 Wouldn't Have Other Competition*... I mean that's just not true.  For the example, they have at least 7 other games of competition from the established franchise, as well as any similar games that have expanded beyond the established formula.  There needs to be innovation or a unique piece to help them stand out, and just copying the existing formula won't help with that.

*  *Lower Budget Games - Standing Out is not as Critical*... Also not true - Lower budget games still need to recoup that budget and be profitable, even for indie titles. If anything, it's even more important for a low budget title to stand out, as they're generally made by smaller, independent studios.  A lower budget game will generally also have a lower sale price - Mercenaries Saga, for instance, is $15 on the switch for all three games together, and I want to say each individually was $7 or less (which makes sense since the series started on mobile phones).  At the time of the first game's release, it's possible that FFT wasn't on mobile devices (I can't find a release date for MS1), and even if it was it's a pretty pricey mobile port because Square.  You also still need to garner interest, whether there's a large pool of games to choose from or not, because it's rare for someone to be limited to just one genre/subgenre of games, and you want them to pick your title.  Add in the increasing level of digital purchases and your inventory of choices goes up - Not only do you have access to more current, digital-only titles, but you also have more access to games from yesteryear - And SRPGs tend to age very well, as the mechanics are largely consistent over the past 10-20 years.

Since we're talking about God Wars... The hook to it was the story that they were trying to tell, which deviates from the (mostly standard) European Medieval Fantasy Setting by focusing more on Japanese folklore.  It was also one of the relatively few games developed by Kadokawa Games (tho it was localized by NIS), a relatively small studio trying to push into the SRPG genre.  They tried to tell a story that wasn't being told while still maintaining familiar mechanics to draw people in.  Also that 100k number was within something like a week and a half of it's release, which isn't too bad, all things considered (As of June 27 2017, earliest release was June 16 same year).

And I mean, again... FFTactics is one of the most critically acclaimed SRPGs out there, with more general name recognition than Fire Emblem.

&gt;President Trump tweeted out this message back in March and the fish-mouthed Governor Brown responded, “Bridges are better than walls.”

&gt;Better for whom?

&gt;California has a large economy, but people are fleeing the state’s high taxes. Some of its cities’ backstreets now resemble third world countries. San Francisco is filled with homeless drug addicts who leave feces and discarded needles in the streets. In one year the city spent $275 million on homelessness and supportive housing and the problem is getting worse, not better.

&gt;Why is our military guarding borders in myriad countries overseas while we aren’t guarding our own?

&gt;Why do we continue to allow violent, criminal gangs easy entry into our country?

&gt;The answer is always the same. Lefties such as Governor Moonbeam want socialism and like Obama, he knows nationalism is at odds with that. He wants our culture destroyed and our borders wide open.

&gt;“Gimmegrants” come in and get free education, free medical care, free driver licenses, free food and are free to ignore things such as car insurance or showing up in court.

There is nothing in our Constitution that states we must use government to steal from hard working Americans and hand over the loot to anyone in the world who may be encountering difficult times.

&gt; Às vezes há que saber perdoar. 

Não venhas com conversa para tapar os olhos. 

&gt;  Também o Aboubakar teve uma má atitude quando não estava no Porto e deu cartas. 

Quero lá saber o que o Aboubakar fez e deixou de fazer, e se o Porto se vergou. Que me lembre o problema do Aboubakar foi com o treinador e ele veio porque o Sergio falou com ele. Por isso para alem de não ter nada a ver com o Benfica também é completamente irrelevante para a situação do Talisca.

O Talisca após um jogo em que celebrou feito tolo contra nós, foi para as televisões e jornais falar mal do clube. Dizer que o Benfica não pagava salários, o Benfica teve que vir a publico publicar um contrato para mostrar que o jogador era um autentico mentiroso. Ainda para mais, o Talisca vem com a conversa de ""na altura tinha uma filha com apenas 6 dias e o Benfica pagava salários a toda a gente menos a mim"". Como a dizer que por causa do Benfica pagar a filha dela passava mal. Quer dizer um futebolista que recebe aos milhares de euros todos os meses, fica um mês sem receber e diz que passou problemas porque tinha a filha e a mulher a depender dele? Então ele não devia ser responsável pela filha dele se ao fim de 2 anos no Benfica a receber milhares todos os vezes ao fim de um mês sem receber e é logo um problema... Não deve ser muito responsável.

Mais, ainda há uns meses depois de ter renovado com o Benfica perguntaram\-lhe da situação depois de um jogo pelo Besiktas e ele respondeu que foi meio ameaçado pelo Benfica para renovar, que se não renovasse o Benfica ia\-lhe tirar das competições Europeias... E no dia seguinte, não me lembro se foi ele próprio ou o agente que veio desmentir a dizer que não era verdade que era ameaçado.

Ou seja por vários vezes veio a publico dizer mal do clube, com acusações graves, na primeira vez foi desmentido imediatamente pelo Benfica e na segunda vez ele próprio desmentiu. É um gajo que mente com os dentes todos, não tem vergonha na cara, um ingrato do caralho, e agora vamos perdoar isto? Opá chega de gozo, chega um ponto que não há volta a dar.

False,JoanJeff,,,,"It's a very complicated issue and I appreciate how carefully you've introduced it. I can only offer a few general thoughts on how we might think about slavery.

One of the great challenges we face is that we tend to approach all slavery via slavery in the U.S. In the U.S. slavery was particularly brutal. Obviously no slave system is just or moral but most systems were much less violent and destructive than U.S. slavery. Europe had a long history of unfree labor but that doesn't mean it was always brutally violent. In many times and places unfree laborers were tied to the land but had some freedom of movement and property. A good example would be [serfdom in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom_in_Russia) which in some areas persisted into the late nineteenth century. Another example might be indentured servitude. Serfdom and indentured servitude were bad business. Slavery in medieval Europe was bad business. But it wasn't always as terribly violent as what happened in the U.S. 

The other somewhat unique aspect of slavery in the U.S. (and the Americas more generally) is that it was racialized. In the U.S. only people of African descent were enslaved and there were laws which carefully defined who would be considered black and who could be enslaved. (indigenous peoples were also enslaved but that was a rather short-lived process in British colonies). Thus U.S. slavery has been intertwined with the history of race and came to depend upon and reinforce pseudo-scientific theories of racial difference and African inferiority. Because of this we tend to assume that slavery is always bound up in ideas of racial difference and that all slave owners believe their slaves are intellectually and morally inferior. But that is not true.

Yes, it's true that Spartacus did not want to end all slavery. As far as I know, most Roman slave revolts, including the Servile Wars, seem to have been motivated by a desire to gain individual freedom or to protest a specific set of harsh conditions faced by the rebelling slaves. I don't think Spartacus cared about the existence of slaves in Hispania or the mistreatment of slaves in Africa.

&gt;Ian Blackford, the Nationalist leader at Westminster, said the constitutional battle over devolution of powers after Brexit would now transfer to the UK Supreme Court.

&gt;Just hours before the latest Joint Ministerial Committee meeting in Whitehall even began and after Michael Russell, the Scottish Government’s Brexit Minister, suggested a deal could still be struck, Mr Blackford effectively conceded there would be no last-minute breakthrough and the matter would now be decided by judges.

&gt;As Mr Russell prepared for yet another round of talks on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which his Government believes is a “power-grab,” and as peers began to debate the devolution issues relating to Brexit, Mr Blackford denounced as “absolutely scandalous” what he believes is the attempt by Theresa May and her colleagues to undermine the devolution settlement in Scotland.

&gt;The Prime Minister has denied the legislation is a “power-grab” - as all the political parties at Holyrood bar the Conservatives claim it is - and insists that more powers will be going to the Scottish Parliament post Brexit.

&gt;But she wants to freeze some 24 so that common UKwide frameworks on areas like agriculture and environmental protection can be agreed to protect the country’s single market.

&gt;In the Commons chamber, the SNP’s Patrick Grady, during Welsh Questions, noted how the Tories were “isolated” at Holyrood over the Brexit bill and urged UK ministers to pause its passage through Westminster until there was agreement with MSPs.

&gt;Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary, brushed aside the Glasgow MP’s request, suggesting that if the SNP administration could “focus on outcomes,” then an agreement could still be possible.

&gt;""I really hope the Scottish Government will see the merits of the certainty and security that we can offer Scottish industry and Scottish business with this agreement,” he added.

&gt;Asked if Mr Grady’s intervention was a sign of desperation by the Nationalists, Mr Blackford replied: “No, not at all...The Government in Edinburgh wants to reach agreement but it seems we are not going to reach agreement; that appears to be where we are; we are right at the wire.

&gt;“It’s wholly regrettable and it’s putting it mildly that we are now in a situation where in effect the two governments are going to have to seek to resolve this through the Supreme Court.

&gt;""It’s absolutely unprecedented that we are in this situation and it will be up to the court to try to navigate its way through this if the Governments can’t reach agreement.”

&gt;Stressing how the Scottish Government believed it had a “very robust case” to put before the court in arguing that the Continuity Bill was competent and should become law, the Highland MP declared: “We have an obligation to defend the devolution settlement.

&gt;""There was no other alternative to that.

&gt;“The fact the UK Government is prepared in effect to ignore what is there in statute from the 1998 Scotland Act is absolutely scandalous, frankly. It is not acceptable they are treating the Scottish Parliament in the way they are.”

&gt;He added: “If there is a failure to reach an agreement in the coming days, which is where I suspect we are, then we are going to be in a situation that this will be determined by the Supreme Court; that in itself is unchartered territory since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1998.”

&gt;Speaking ahead of the JMC meeting, Mr Russell claimed the UK Government's proposals would mean Westminster “having free reign to tie the Scottish Parliament's hands for up to seven years - without its consent - on key devolved policies”.

&gt;He went on: ""The UK Government is demanding we sign up to a bizarre proposal that would allow them to treat a straight refusal of the Scottish Parliament to consent to changes in devolved powers as a green light to go ahead and change them anyway.”

&gt;Mr Russell added: ""An agreement can, however, still be reached. Either remove clause 11 completely - so that there is equity between the Scottish Parliament and Westminster - or the UK Government could accept the amendments tabled in the House of Lords by Lord Hope and Lord Mackay so that the present system is continued where any regulations altering the powers of the Scottish Parliament can only be made when that is agreed by the Parliament.""

&gt;It is thought Lord Hope’s compromise amendment to introduce more checks and balances in any cross-border dispute will not be put to a vote.

&gt;Indeed, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers are not expected to oppose the new changed Clause 11, which deals with devolved issues.

&gt;Earlier, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will chair the JMC, stressed how the Withdrawal Bill had already been ""changed significantly"" and there was now a ""host of new powers set to transfer directly from the EU to the devolved administrations"".

&gt;Whitehall insiders have made clear that, having sealed a deal on the legislation with the Labour-run Welsh Government, the UK Government cannot move any more as to do so could jeopardise the agreement with Cardiff.

&gt;David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, is expected to get a rough ride at the Scottish Parliament tomorrow when he appears before its Constitution Committee.

&gt;Once the Brexit bill completes its Report Stage next week and before its Third Reading on May 18, it will go to Holyrood for MSPs to decide, or not, to give their consent.

&gt;Given the SNP Government’s stance, rejection is certain.

&gt;Both governments are already talking to the Supreme Court about dates for the hearing on the Continuity Bill.

&gt; # Pol Espargaro Renews With KTM For 2 More Years - New Round Of Silly Season Signings Imminent? | MotoMatters.com | Kropotkin Thinks 
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; With the MotoGP paddock back in Europe and heading to Jerez, the first round of contract announcements is upon us, with the second wave not far behind. First domino to fall for the moment is Pol Espargaro, who will be staying at KTM for the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Ahead of his first home Grand Prix of 2018, KTM today officially announced they will be retaining the services of the Spaniard for the next two years.
&gt; 
&gt; Espargaro's signing had been broadly expected. The Spaniard has outperformed his teammate Bradley Smith, and with the Austrian factory's MotoGP project moving from the development phase to the point where they need to start producing results, Espargaro has been favored over Smith.
&gt; 
&gt; Espargaro's contract may not be the only rider signing to be announced in Jerez. It now seems certain that Johann Zarco will be joining Espargaro in the factory KTM team, and the announcement could come as early as this weekend. Zarco also had an offer from HRC to partner Marc Marquez in the Repsol Honda team, but the Frenchman is believed to have preferred to try to beat Marquez on different machinery, rather than face him on the bike developed around him. The logical place to announce Zarco's signing would be Le Mans, but it may not be possible to sit on the news for that long, as the MotoGP grapevine cannot keep secrets for that long.
&gt; 
&gt; Jerez is likely to be a very busy weekend for rider managers. UK publication MCN is reporting that the deal between Suzuki and Jorge Lorenzo is as good as done, despite the financial obstacles such a deal faced. As Lorenzo also faced a drop in salary at Ducati, if he had chosen to remain there, he may have decided to jump to a bike that suits his style better, and which he may believe he will be capable of winning on straight away, without having to work so hard to adjust his riding style to.
&gt; 
&gt; Whether that deal gets done or not at Jerez, the Spanish circuit will be a busy weekend for Suzuki. The factory's top brass will be flying in to Jerez for talks with the Marc VDS team about becoming a Suzuki satellite team for the next three years. Marc VDS as Suzuki satellite squad would help, not just with development - it is likely that Suzuki would be providing bikes of almost identical spec to the factory bikes to the team - but also as a conduit for talent. Franco Morbidelli is a hot property in MotoGP, and having the young Italian on the Suzuki would offer the Japanese factory a way to deepen their talent pool. It would also allow Joan Mir to step up to MotoGP in 2019. A deal with Suzuki will have to be signed at Jerez, to allow Marc VDS to be able to prepare in time for next year.
&gt; 
&gt; Other contracts to be discussed at Jerez include Andrea Dovizioso, who is still in talks with Ducati and will sign with them again at some point, with only the details to be left out. With Lorenzo likely to leave Ducati, the second seat in the Italian factory is open. Nominally, Danilo Petrucci has an option for that seat should it become available, but [the option for that lies with Ducati](https://www.gpone.com/en/2017/12/11/motogp/petrucci-me-on-the-factory-ducati-team-its-in-my-hands.html), rather than Petrucci. Ducati could choose to put Pecco Bagnaia straight into the factory squad alongside Dovizioso, rather than putting him into the Pramac team first. Or they could look at some of the displaced riders, such as Dani Pedrosa - who is certain to lose his Repsol Honda seat - or Andrea Iannone. Having Iannone back would be a stretch, however: the Italian was not a good fit with Dovizioso when the pair were racing together, and with Dovizioso performing as he is, Ducati may not want to risk ruining the atmosphere.
&gt; 
&gt; There is still a lot of ground to cover before all of the contracts are signed for 2019 and MotoGP's Silly Season is in the books. Yamaha have to find a team to [run satellite Yamahas](/node/14010), and once again, MCN added an interesting wrinkle to this story, Simon Patterson reporting that the [Sepang International Circuit is looking to collaborate with an existing team in MotoGP](https://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2018/april/motogp-sepang-pitching-for-a-motogp-team/), to keep Malaysian rookie Hafizh Syahrin in the premier class. This tallies with what [circuit boss Razlan Razali told Crash.net's Peter McLaren earlier this year](https://www.crash.net/motogp/news/891458/1/2019-incentives-sepang-moto2-moto3-riders), where he mentioned the possibility almost as a joke. The meeting rooms in team trucks will be fully occupied this weekend at Jerez.
&gt; 
&gt; The KTM press release announcing Pol Espargaro's contract extension appears below:
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Pol Espargaro renews Red Bull KTM Factory Racing contract till 2020**
&gt; 
&gt; MotoGP Announcement
&gt; 
&gt; Red Bull KTM Factory Racing are delighted to confirm that Pol Espargaro has signed a two year extension to his current contract to remain part of the works team for the 2019 and 2020 MotoGP seasons.
&gt; 
&gt; Pol Espargaro was one of the first recruits for KTM’s comprehensive and dedicated effort to fight with the very best teams and factories at the pinnacle of motorcycle racing. The new agreement will take the Spaniard into four years representing the Austrian brand as the company eyes considerable expansion in MotoGP from 2019 onwards.
&gt; 
&gt; Espargaro: “It has been really easy for me to make this decision; I did not think of another possibility for even a minute. I cannot hide how happy I am being involved in this amazing project, despite the challenges and the work we still have to go through. I love the KTM philosophy and I want to continue trying to reach our goals. I don’t know when we will be able to do it, but I’m sure that we will arrive. I have to thank my whole crew for how they push and how they support me, with the leadership of my crew chief Paul Trevathan, and for sure Mike Leitner and Pit Beirer for how they strive every day. And, of course, all the people that work at the races and back at Munderfing. We are a team with an ambitious aim. I’m enjoying my best moments in the MotoGP championship, and I’m really happy to know that I’m going to continue here at least until 2020”.
&gt; 
&gt; Pit Beirer (KTM Motorsports Director): “Pol has been such a strong part of our project and gave us a lot of trust and belief as well as the highlights so far with two ninth positions. I’m really happy we can continue together for another two years because we can build on the work we have already done and keep progressing with the bike; he should definitely be one of the people that should benefit from everything we have achieve and learned and how we will push on in the future.”
&gt; 
&gt; The 26 year old, born in Granollers and in the shadow of the Circuit Barcelona-Catalunya, is negotiating his fifth term in the premier class since claiming the Moto2 title in 2013. #44 has been the strongest performer on the KTM RC16 with four top ten finishes in MotoGP despite the project clocking only 21 events as a full-time member of the Grand Prix grid in the run-up to this weekend’s Gran Premio Red Bull de España at Jerez.

This is why it has pressed so hard to maintain control over Crimea/Syria etc. It cannot afford to just twiddle its thumbs and make purely symbolic or meaningless retaliation in response to the  west continuing to take out its satellites. If it loses these countries it is just a matter of time before Russia itself is starved out and balkanized. Keep pressing Russia and its allies and it will respond with nuclear force because it really is now or never.

Europe still is pretty dependent on Russian resources, and America would by fucked trying to shoulder the burden on its own to prop up the EU. Russia's control over sections of the middle east gives it leverage against EU and once that is gone Russia is next. The only way the west gets rid of Russia is this slow death by a thousand cuts game it has employed for decades now, Russia is aware of it, it knows the end game is at hand. It will not just sit back and let it happen.

You idiots thinking that Russia's ""low GDP"" somehow means it will be easy to defeat are so fucking deluded. Ask the Nazis how that went for them. The Wests trillions of dollars of websites and services and designer shoes and inflated housing prices will not do them  any good in a total war against Russia. Russia has resources, military tech, and will throw its entire population at you while the majority of people in the west are too fat, high, degenerate or just plain pacifist to fight a real war. 

The best option for Russia at this point, to ensure its long term survival, is seriously to just start launching nukes at anyone fucking with them. Even if Russia DID launch nukes and wiped out for example Israel and Saudi Arabia, a very large percentage of Americans and Europeans literally would not care and would be opposed to any nuclear response.

The West ABSOLUTELY cannot win a direct confrontation with Russia. And all these provocations do is ensure a direct confrontation is unavoidable. You had an opportunity to work with Russia to reinstate an authoritarian system over the chaos of the middle east and maybe even contain China, but you pissed that away because you were so butthurt Queen Hillary wasn't annointed. Now you're fucked. Now you have to deal with Russia and China and you're just fucked. You can't win a direct conflict. You little knife cuts will provoke a nuclear response half your countries won't even care to respond to. You're just absolutely totally fucked.

And all you can point to is your fucking ""GDP"" as proof that you're somehow superior and would win. You losers couldn't even pacify Iraq or Afghanistan. Couldn't win Vietnam OR Korea back when you had real men fighting your wars.

MEN, ingen vinner valg på en slik plattform. Så hva gjør de? De plukker opp saker her og der som de tror de kan sanke stemmer på. Spesiellt viktige saker som ingen andre partier tør ta i, slik som innvandring. Så har de andre ""lokke-saker"" som billigere alkohol og lavere bensinpriser og annet tøys og tøv som de skal hente billige stemmer på.

Innvandring er ikke noe de *egentlig* bryr seg om. F.eks. spiller de opp trusselen som kommer fra inkompatible kulturer, men ikke ett ord om sosial dumping som følge av arbeidskraftinnvandring. Hvorfor? Enkelt. De er FOR sosial dumping, fordi de er egentlig bare et parti for rikinger. Det er planen til FrP. Dette mønsteret forklarer alt de gjør.

Hvorfor stemte de for å avgi suverenitet til ACER? Fordi ACER innfører nyliberal politikk i energimarkedet.

He has met with leading white supremacists and associated closely with the leaders of a eugenicist foundation once described by a leading newspaper as a “neo-Nazi organization.” He has made a series of racist statements about Latinos and worried that they were outbreeding whites. At one point, he wrote candidly that to maintain American culture, “a European-American majority” is required.

Breakfast at any little trattoria near your hotel. If you can stay in the *Borgo Pio,* the neighborhood between the Vatican and Hadrian's tomb, then you're well\-located. I have used the Trianon \([http://www.trianonborgopio.com/en/](http://www.trianonborgopio.com/en/)\) a few times. Very nice, although as with most Italian hotels, the check\-in process will astound and confuse you. If you do this, there are several typical cafes just downstairs and around the corner.

Off to St. Peters. Do not pay a tour guide, they're all atheist Germans. Download a basic tour from the web. Several astounding things are not well marked, so you need a checklist. Several Masses are likely to be happening at various side altars. If you want a great confession experience, go to the right rear corner, at most times there are active confessionals. Good confessors...I like the Chinese priest. He seems to just be there, year after year. 2 hours later, you've seen St. Peter's, and are a better person for it. Into the city.

Walk past Hadrian's tomb, across the Tiber, and 10 minutes to the Pantheon. Tour the Pantheon briefly. Walk left around the Patheon and across the street, enter the Basilica of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva \(Church of St. Mary built over the temple of Minerva\) and talk to Saint Catherine\([https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock\-Images/Rights\-Managed/IBR\-599678](https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/IBR-599678)\). It's about 11am now.

Across the street to Gammarelli and\([https://www.gammarelli.com/](https://www.gammarelli.com/)\) buy something sweet for your favorite priest. Time for lunch. For me, I like to try to first little trattoria on the next street. It's OK, we're going to have an epic dinner, so you can just get a slice of pizza.

Grab a cab in front of the Pantheon and hold on, you need to be at the Villa Borghese \([http://www.galleriaborghese.it/en/](http://www.galleriaborghese.it/en/)\) for your 1:00  pm ticket time. Have your plan of attack, you want to try to see it all, but then it all goes to hell when you are faced with Apollo and Daphne\([https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo\-and\-Daphne](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-and-Daphne)\) and you just stand, slack\-jawed, and marvel that human hands can do that with stone. They eventually have to ask you to move on.

3:00, find a cab, and go to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major\([http://www.thegoodcatholiclife.com/2013/03/17/visiting\-the\-basilica\-of\-st\-mary\-major/](http://www.thegoodcatholiclife.com/2013/03/17/visiting-the-basilica-of-st-mary-major/)\) Drag yourself out at 4:00. Time for a few more.

On your way back to your room in the Borgo, stop at the Church of St. Louis, go around the corner at the back, drop a coin in the box to turn the lights on, and see The Calling of Saint Matthew \([https://i1.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c\_fill,g\_auto,w\_620,h\_310/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/web\-caravaggio\-painting\-public\-domain.jpg?resize=620&amp;#37;2C310&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;ssl=1](https://i1.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,w_620,h_310/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/web-caravaggio-painting-public-domain.jpg?resize=620%2C310&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;ssl=1)\)

False,wrestleholic_jericho,dx,,I've got two words for ya: declining audience!,"2 brands, 2 rosters, 2 sets of PPVs, and 2 live shows is also very detrimental to the product as a whole. The WWF for all its faults was always unique from other organizations by having only 3 to 4 championships active at a time: World's, Intercontinental, Tag Team and sometimes the Women's title. Yes, there was a Light Heavyweight title, and a Women's Tag Team title briefly, but they were often used as ways to promote the WWF in other regions, like how Dynamite Kid fought for the LHW title in Japan.

In the 90s, titles felt like they were devalued because it increased from those 4 to 7, including the European, Hardcore, and reintroduced LHW titles. During the Invasion, they added the WCW World's, US, Tag Team, and Cruiserweight titles for a total of 11 titles to be defended. In the first brand extension, it was eventually down to 8 titles - 4 per show with World's, mid-card, tag team, and women's titles.

Now, we're back to 4 titles per brand as well as a Cruiserweight title that is barely featured. When everyone has the gold, the gold becomes meaningless. I don't think we need strict WWF 1992 settings where there were only 3 titles, but champions being dual branded across the board is the only way you can really salvage the situation. It gives intrigue because now you don't know who is challenging, it excuses some people for appearing on varying shows, adds variety to the opponents and makes the titles meaningful and special again.

Wrestling isn't hot right now, they can't sustain 2 separate crews but they have an affinity for hiring anyone with talent just to have them, so we're dealing with bloated rosters that are to the brim with underutilized talent. If everyone is a star, nobody benefits from winning or losing, and everyone is by effect average at best. They need to cut some people, give more shine to different acts, and let the talent grow. Right now it's too crowded for any real growth, and as long as they continue this way then they will continue to hemorrhage their TV ratings and live event sales.

For instance, the new book Celtic Religions in the Roman Period: Personal, Local and Global (with many acclaimed Celticist authors contributing to the content) makes the argument that many of the polytheistic religions in ‘Celtic’ (read: lands of people who speak a Celtic language) lands were very regional and had different understandings of similar and different gods, and also different religious functions while remaining very similar.

It also puts out the idea that because there were so many variables and different religions, perhaps Celtic religion (plural) was not descended from a Common Celtic belief structure.

The problem with wanting an older religion that’s Indo-European in origin is that most of the time, it’ll end up being constructed or reconstructed, which doesn’t mean it’s wrong or right. Reconstruction, as a tool, only tells us what MAY have been. My advice on this then, if oldest is still your big qualification for a religion to follow, is to check out Brythonic or Gaulish Polytheism.

I'm of the opinion that chicago school is more popular than it gets on in the seats of government, but I think I'm understanding your pov a bit better. The Austrian school is (to you) more of the idealistic end goal?

&gt; When the rightwing wants to cut down on welfare, it's mostly to limit monetarism but of course this gets transformed into tax cuts for votes and money from donors when the politicians gets their hands on it.

This is sort of what I'm not sure I understand. Monetarism ( as I understand it) is the use of some form of centralized control over a monetary system to ensure that the supply of a currency doesn't grow too quickly or stagnate. To me opposition to this on the right wing is based on either the idea that a central bank controlling currency is bad because it's not dictated by markets ( to use a non pejorative way of describing this I call this ""market school""), and the other is some form of thing that invariably winds up being an anti semitic conspiracy about the central banks and the rothschilds. 
I guess my confusion  on this comes down to 2 main points:

-Monetarism seems to be the basis of monetary policy, so what does this have to do with welfare?

-If a market is  the thing that produces the best outcomes in terms of the distribution of resources, social status, etc..... then why the opposition to transnational capitlaism?

&gt; Go back to classical liberalism, read John Locke, he points out the need for what we would call a ""national narrative"" today, some sort of cohesive unity within the nation

I'm not sure I understand this at all. Nation states have never been cohesive entities with singular unified goals and aspirations. Typically it's the interests of multiple groups with struggle over class, access to resources, religions, race, etc..... Whats more is many of the forms of nationalism are themselves constructed from arbitrary geographic distinctions. Scottish seperatism, catalonian independence, The Split between Sudan and south sudan and the split in south sudan between dinka and nuer, etc.... are examples of how fluid and dynamic this concept is over time. 

&gt;immigration has shown not to produce that at least not with the current amount of immigration and that's what the rightwing is reacting to, it's this social cohesion that is going lost, it's not some sort of hatred for the brownies despite the lefts portrayal of the rightwing.

I'm not sure I follow this either. What social cohesion? How is it being lost? We've never really lived in socially cohesive societies, because societies are dynamic entities with changing perspectives, ideas, etc.... To make a comparison we look at somebody like kanye west saying ""slavery is a choice"" with relative disgust because it goes against our modern sensibilities, yet 160 years ago those ideas would be relatively uncontroversial. Heck at the turn of the 20th century a eugenics movement was all the rage in Europe and America, the idea of a 40 hour work week was radical, the idea of premarital sex being acceptable was unthinkable, and the idea that maybe a god isn't real was a social taboo in many socieities. 

My point is mostly that the tendency to view national identity as this thing under threat, and that social cohesion is at risk seems...odd? 

Whats more is that this idea can lead to very dark places very quickly. The main thesis of neofascist/ white supremacist groups is basically 14, 88. With 14 being a reference to david lanes ""14 words"", a 14 word slogan about the need to preserve the white race against an ethereal threat of white genocide ( being ""out bred"" by non white people), and 88 being an allusion to nazism/ fascism. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that from an outside perspective it's difficult to tell the difference between ""We need to preserve social cohesion of western societies from the influence of outside cultures and hoards of immigrants"" and ""We need to preserve the white race from white genocide via outside powers and hoards of immigrants"". It seems like a way of saying the same thing, albiet with an allusion to an idea of western society instead of explicitly white people.

Whats more is that when folks single out mexicans as being rapists, muslims as being terrorists, black people as being criminal/ ""thugs"", it's very difficult to tell the difference between principled dedication to the idea of a cohesive society, and racial or ethnic resentment/ chauvanism. 

&gt;he would cut down with maybe 5% per year and let private interests take over organically.

So privitization de jure instead of privitization de facto? 

&gt; At this point in time, they wield no power and if you go and try and speak with them, they will explain their issues and some of those even have merits, it's the solutions that you're going to disagree with.

The things that nazis say that ""have merit"" to me mostly come down to ""there are problems with the status quo"", beyond that they lose me because the ideology is inherently based in the idea that non white people are inferior/ represent an inherently negative thing.

 Further still I'd disagree that they lack power. Perhaps not richard spencer type people, but theres a powerful segment of the political class that has no problem with mass deportations, abuses made by ICE, mass incarceration, etc... primarily against minorities so long as it defends this broader idea of the united states, just not large segments of the actual country. 

&gt;In Boston last year there was an example of a ""free speech""-demonstration where there was maybe a couple of hundred people and tens of thousands met up to counterprotest because they thought it was Nazis.

Well, that rally had Sol Invictus (holocaust denier) as a main speaker, Kyle Chapman ( who has on video expressed explicit white nationalist views), etc.... Granted that they were uninvited for PR reasons ( which honestly doesn't make the inherent suscpicion go away because had the neo nazis not killed anybody at charlottseville they'd have been there, and rejecting white supremacy ""because it looks bad"" isn't to me a good response to it, as much as it is a less bad response).

&gt;I don't particular like them either but there is just nothing to fear from them where as I do actually fear Marxism because it is creeping in

I'm not sure I understand this either.  Then again I am a marxist so  thats probably why.

I guess my main misunderstanding is this. Generally the framework of marxism is that there exists exploitation by those with wealth, and that as a result peoples lives are materially worse off. These conditions will lead to the necessity of people taking the means of production and giving it to the community. You don't have to agree with it, but this style of thinking ( to me) seems to have some degree of things which indicate moral reasoning ( namely that exploitation is wrong, and that workers deserve to be treated well). 

Fascist ideology is ( to me) an inherently repulsive idea based on the idea that outsiders are inferior, racial supremacy is good, and that militarism to achieve supremacy of race/ nation is not only justified but good. 

I can understand not being a marxist, as that just informs ones economics. What I don't get is that marxism is seen with visceral disdain/ evil, while fascism is seen as a bad, but more of a side story. The reason I don't get this is because I can't see any examples of ""good"" fascists. I can point out that [MLK frequently spoke out against racism and the inequities of capitalism](https://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/riot-language-unheard-9-mlk-quotes-mainstream-media-wont-cite) Of that [The 40 hour work week came from groups like the national federation of labor, a group with socialist leanings](http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-40-hour-workweek-2015-10).  

&gt;Now I understand that the left on the other hand have this feeling that Trump is practically a Nazi and working with the Russians but he is not even close on those, 

See I don't see trump as a nazi, but I do think he has racist views and perceptions, especially about mexicans coming to rape and kill people ( sic; white women), or muslims being inherently evil. I think he made very open concessions to racists ( pardoning arpaio for racial profiling, putting steve bannon into a key position of power, endorsing roy moore, refusing to unequivocally condemn nazis without making comments on how bad counter protesters were, etc....).",True,False,0,1525297572,,False,0,dyck7ar,False,t3_8gihaq,False,t1_dyceby1,/r/samharris/comments/8gihaq/is_it_accurate_to_call_paul_joseph_watson_farright/dyck7ar/,,1527006978,4,False,True,False,samharris,t5_2thqg,public,

There are weekly, Large scale Multiplayer events (like a couple hundred man siege) there are usually 100 - 200 man Napoleonic line battles a 1 - 3x a week (including ""Regiments"" that are like clans you join and you all work together and even do scrims and such)

False,HigherMeta,,,,"Nice article, but obvious bias. My main criticism is that while the author is correct in saying that we are at an important moment in history, when much is at risk, he completely fails to place China's development strategy in historical context. He ignores similar cases like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and fails to mention the fact that current international rules and institutions are significantly tilted in favor of incumbents - that is, the already developed, advanced economies. 

He brings up the concept of developing countries from the WTO and their special treatment, but fails to mention why this concept even exists, and the fact that by WTO standards, China *still* is a developing country. Don't be blinded by the Shanghai skyscrapers - most of China is still poor, 40% of it is still comprised of rural peasants, and the GDP per capita even adjusted for purchasing power is barely at the level of Iraq. Yes, *Iraq*.

The Washington consensus - the idea that the best path to economic development is free trade and free market - has completely failed the developing world. It has allowed powerful multi-national corporations from first world countries to dominate the economies of lesser countries, depriving them of economic - and thus political - independence, and rendering them little more than colonies providing low skilled labor and natural resources. 

No, neocolonialism isn't completely right, but look around you: how many countries have escaped the low or middle income trap, and how did they do it? You hear of the East Asian tigers and their miracles, but did you ever hear of the South American miracles? No? Why not? Is it because, as we've been told by the free market supporters, that East Asians are just that much harder working and intelligent, and so were destined to be successful? Or is it because of a more basic difference - the fact that Latin America followed the steps laid out by Washington, instead of the protectionist, exports led development model pursued by countries like Japan, South Korea, and now China and Vietnam?

It was often said a few decades ago, that corruption was at the heart of the economic problems of Latin America, that Latin America could not develop because it didn't have the Japanese samurai spirit, or later, the South Korean sense of nationalism. Yet today, countries as corrupt and diverse as China have demonstrated the same trajectory as earlier East Asian tigers, so much so that the US and EU are actively trying to slow them down, knock them back. 

How is this possible, had it been the case that hard work and free market were all you needed? It is incredible to me that there are still economists who think that developing countries playing by the exact same rules as developed countries will lead them to prosperity. You don't catch up by developing at the same speed, especially not when the guy in front of you owns the road.

Going back to China - the Chinese have stolen Western intellectual property, have forced Western companies to play by rules that are less than fair, and have subsidized their own economies and products in order to achieve import substitution and international competitiveness. But all of this is to be expected, because playing it the way Washington would have liked, would have led to China becoming no different from South America. How could domestic Chinese companies hope to compete, without subsidies, with multi-national corporations worth hundreds of billions, under free market rules that would allow the latter to out spend, out talent, and out compete at will? 

It is delusional to argue that pay differences favor the enterprises of developing countries when foreign companies could just build factories there and take advantage of the same. It is ridiculous to say that their advantage would be their more modern infrastructure, when that infrastructure is owned by foreign enterprises. Even a complete beginner to economics should be able to realize how stupid the entire concept is, and how much it favors the existing rich. It's no surprise that the US maintained 50% tariffs against all foreign imports, all the way until the end of World War II, when it suddenly became feasible for the US to turn the tables on Europe and get rich off of free trade.

No one can fault the US for acting in its own economic interests, and perhaps the biggest loser, in the long term, will be the concept of free trade, itself. But it is necessary to understand the story from both sides of the table, instead of acting like one side cheats and the other is clean. 

Free market capitalism is a system that principally favors the existing economic hierarchy - that is to say, the rich gets richer. Its main benefit is that, different from the common saying, the poor does not get absolutely poorer, but rather only in a relative sense. Everyone benefits from more economic activity, more consumption, more production, etc. - the rich simply more so than the rest. Yet, as a developing country with the ambition to one day equal the developed countries in wealth,  that is obviously not enough.

Además, el 57 % de los y las demandantes de crédito vivían en zonas rurales. Estos datos que corresponden a 2014 se sacaron de un informe titulado Baromètre 2016 de la microfinance. [[9](#nb2-9 ""Estos datos que se refieren a 2014 están sacados de Baromètre 2016 de la (...)"")] El documento fue editado en francés por un “consortium” que reunía a los tres principales bancos franceses (BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale), la Fundación Grameen – Crédit Agricole, Renault, Véolia (primera transnacional mundial para los servicios de agua, energía y residuos), Master Card, Engie (GDF SUEZ), Danone (agroalimentaria), KPMG (una de las cuatro firmas de auditoría a nivel mundial), Vinci (infraestructuras de transporte y gestión: autopistas, aeropuertos, energía, BTP), el Ayuntamiento de París, el gobierno monárquico del principado de Mónaco, el ministerio francés de Relaciones Exteriores y de Desarrollo Internacional… La gran mayoría de los créditos concedidos se sitúan entre los 100 y los 1000 dólares.

&gt; 
&gt; La mayoría de los bancos privados internacionales crearon una rama de microcréditos encargada de detectar las ocasiones propicias para introducirse en el sector, mediante, en general, la asociación con agencias de microcrédito ya existentes.
&gt; 
&gt; Ciertamente, los montos prestados son pequeños pero, como ya hemos mencionado, 2.000 millones de adultos no tienen ninguna cuenta bancaria y son potenciales clientes del microcrédito. Hay que tener en cuenta dos factores muy importantes: en primer lugar, los tipos de interés reales practicados en el sector de las microfinanzas (al añadir al tipo oficial, las diversas comisiones exigidas por los prestamistas) oscilan entre el 25 y el 50 %; en segundo lugar, según las agencias de microcrédito, el porcentaje de cobro es superior al 90 %, ya que los pobres tienen la tendencia a hacer lo imposible con tal de devolver un préstamo.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Un reto estratégico para el capitalismo**
&gt; 
&gt; El sistema capitalista funciona porque busca permanentemente cómo penetrar y dominar esferas, espacios que no domina por completo. A fines del siglo XX, consiguió una enorme victoria con la restauración de las relaciones capitalistas en sociedades como la de la URSS, la de los otros países europeos de ese bloque, así como en las de China y Vietnam. El capitalismo aborda la crisis ambiental como una ocasión para desarrollar el mercado de los permisos de contaminación y el capitalismo verde. [[10](#nb2-10 ""Daniel Tanuro, El imposible capitalismo verde. Del vuelco climático a la (...)"")] Desde los años 1960, con el desarrollo de la revolución verde, logró encadenar a centenares de millones de campesinos al engranaje de las relaciones capitalistas haciéndolos dependientes de las semillas, pesticidas, herbicidas, fertilizantes, etc. que patenta y produce. A partir de los años 1990, se desarrolló una nueva ola de desposesión mediante una política de acaparamiento de tierras a gran escala en el ámbito internacional. [[11](#nb2-11 ""Nicolas Sersiron, «Terres préemptées, néo-colonialisme renforcé», (...)"")]
&gt; 
&gt; Desde los años 1980, con el desarrollo del microcrédito, el capitalismo tiene como objetivo introducir, progresivamente, a los 2.000 millones de adultos que todavía no tienen ninguna cuenta bancaria en el circuito financiero que domina. Estas 2.000 millones de personas, en su mayoría mujeres, ya están introducidas en las relaciones monetarias de manera más o menos profunda, pero una parte del trabajo realizado y una parte de lo producido todavía permanece en la esfera doméstica o comunitaria no monetaria (producción alimentaria de autosubsistencia y trabajo en el hogar). Es un reto estratégico para los capitalistas conseguir introducirlas, de manera sistemática, en el sistema capitalista mediante el endeudamiento formalizado a través de relaciones contractuales de préstamo. Se trata, por ejemplo, de acabar con el sistema tradicional de mutualización del ahorro entre mujeres, allí donde todavía existe. Acabar, por ejemplo, con las «tontinas» del África subsahariana, un sistema en el que las mujeres ponen en común sus ahorros y se prestan por turnos las sumas necesarias para algunos gastos extraordinarios o para proyectos y/o inversiones. Introducir mediante el endeudamiento la parte de la humanidad que, hasta ahora, no estaba todavía plenamente insertada en las relaciones formales (contractuales) capitalistas, constituye realmente un reto estratégico.
&gt; 
&gt; Y por ello, se está desarrollando en ese terreno la actividad de los gobiernos, de los organismos internacionales como el Banco Mundial y todos los bancos multilaterales que operan en los países del Sur (Banco Africano de Desarrollo, Banco Asiático de Desarrollo, Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, Banco Europeo de Inversiones, etc.), de las grandes empresas financieras comerciales (las grandes cadenas de distribución), de las sociedades de comunicación (principalmente las de la telefonía móvil).
&gt; 
&gt; Al lado del microcrédito propiamente dicho, sobre el que trata este artículo, hay que contar también el desarrollo del crédito al consumo otorgado por las cadenas de distribución comercial en un gran número de [países emergentes Países emergentes Los países emergentes designan la veintena de paísesen desarrollo teniendo acceso a los mercados financieros](http://www.cadtm.org//Paises-emergentes). Y subrayar también el desarrollo de la utilización de los teléfonos móviles para efectuar pagos y transferencias de dinero, especialmente por personas que no tienen cuentas bancarias. [[12](#nb2-12 ""Ver «Le Kenya, leader mondial du paiement mobile», . Véase también «ONU, (...)"")]Este crecimiento de pagos mediante el teléfono móvil merece un estudio específico.
&gt; 
&gt;  **La fábula del microcrédito**
&gt; 
&gt; La cuestión principal para Muhammad Yunus es: «¿Cómo autorizar que la mitad más frágil de la población del mundo pueda unirse a la corriente principal de la economía mundial y adquirir la capacidad de participar en el libre mercado?».4 Yunus parte del postulado de que la economía mundial funciona bien por medio del libre mercado: el único problema de los pobres es que todavía no traspasaron el umbral. Acceder a un primer préstamo les abrirá el paso. ¿Los bancos consideran que los pobres no son solventes? ¿Y no les otorgan préstamos? Yunus comprobará qué pasa cuando se conceden préstamos a los pobres. Con sus equipos, presionará sobre este tema: «Cuando alguien trata de esquivar un ofrecimiento de préstamo con el pretexto de que no tiene experiencia en los negocios y no quiere aceptar ese dinero, nosotros buscamos convencerlo que la cuestión es encontrar una idea de actividad económica para realizar» Endeudaos en primer lugar y luego veremos que llegaréis a hacer… Para Yunus, «el social-business es la pieza que falta en el sistema capitalista. Su introducción puede permitir salvar el sistema». La cuestión es saber si hay que salvar un sistema mortífero.

&gt; Tindersticks are an alternative band from Nottingham, England. Their sound is characterized by a synthesis of orchestral backing, lounge jazz, and soul; the lush orchestrations of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe and the smoky baritone of lead vocalist Stuart A. Staples are the band's hallmarks. Tindersticks have employed electric guitars, as most rock bands have done, but augment their instrumentation with a wide array of instruments: Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, vibraphone, violin, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, bassoon, Hammond organ, and many more are prominently utilized in the music of Tindersticks. 

&gt; The band has a cult following in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, although the eclectic and unique sound Tindersticks possesses never made significant inroads in the mainstream.

&gt; Personnel

&gt;     * Stuart Ashton Staples, born 14 November 1965 - Lead voice, guitar, melodica
    * Dickon James Hinchliffe, born 9 July 1967 - violin, guitar, voice, piano, string and brass arrangements
    * Neil Timothy Fraser, - born 22 November 1962 - lead guitar, vibraphone
    * David Leonard Boulter, born 27 February 1965 - keyboards, percussion
    * Alasdair Robert De Villeneuve Macaulay, born 2 August 1965 - drums, percussion, trumpet
    * Mark Andrew Colwill, born 12 May 1960 - bass guitar

&gt; The band formed in late 1991, Staples, Boulter, Frazer, Macauley and Hinchcliffe having previously been members of Asphalt Ribbons. The final band line-up for the ""old horse"" mini-LP (1991) was: Stuart Staples (vocals) Dave Boulter (organ &amp; accordion) Neil Fraser (guitar) Dickon Hinchliffe (Guitar &amp; strings) Al Macauley (percussion &amp; drums) John Thompson (bass). Mark Colwill was recruited when John Thompson left the Asphalt Ribbons, but it is not sure if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. Then they changed their name to Tindersticks after Stuart A. Staples discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.

&gt; Tindersticks started recording demo tapes in 1992, and were signed by Tippy Toe Records who released their first single, ""Patchwork"".

&gt; Their self-titled first and second albums established their signature sound and received widespread critical acclaim. Their live performances, often augmented by large string sections and even, on occasion, a full orchestra, were rapturously received. (The live album Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95 is a recording of one such concert.) By the time of the third album, Curtains, however, it was clear that a change of direction was called for. There was a certain ennui to the songs, and the lengthy ""Ballad of Tindersticks"" was a weary swipe at the pressures of being a touring band.

&gt; The fourth album, Simple Pleasure, lived up to its title with a series of snappy, direct songs influenced by soul music. The female backing vocals on several tracks, and the respectful cover of Odyssey's ""If You're Looking For A Way Out"", signalled the band's wish to move towards lighter, more soulful material. However, the inner sleeve's documentation of the number of takes each track went through was evidence that the band continued to adopt a painstaking approach to recording.

&gt; The fifth album, Can Our Love, continued the band's soulful direction, in particular evidence on the tender ""Sweet Release"" and in the nod to the Chi-Lites in the title of ""Chilitetime"".

&gt; The sixth and most recent album, Waiting For The Moon, was more stripped down and introspective in nature, particularly on the harrowing ""4.48 Psychosis"" (based on the play of the same name by the British playwright Sarah Kane) and ""Sometimes It Hurts"". Only the bouncy ""Just A Dog"" lightened the otherwise melancholy mood of the album.

&gt; In 2005 Staples embarked on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. Staples has so far produced two solo albums, Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04 and Leaving Songs. The title of the second album, and Staples' notes on it, indicate that Tindersticks may indeed be at an end: ""These are songs written on the verge of leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew I had to move on from."" 

&gt; In September 2006, the band played a one-off concert at London's Barbican Centre, performing their second album in full with a nine-member string section and two brass players, including former collaborator Terry Edwards on trumpet. This concert brought the band's members back together. A new recording process in 2007 resulted in a new album, The Hungry Saw, which was released on April 28th 2008.

&gt; In the meantime, in July 2007, Island Records had released The BBC Sessions, a double CD compilation of the band's sessions for BBC radio programmes. Also in 2007, a stripped-down line-up of three of the original band, Staples, Boulter and Fraser, spent time writing and recording in a newly-equipped studio in Limousin, France. They were joined by Thomas Belhom on drums and Dan McKinna on bass, with Ian Caple engineering. The resulting album, The Hungry Saw, was released on Beggars Banquet in April 2008. Tindersticks played a number of other European dates during the summer festival season and also announced a winter 2008 European tour.

&gt; In 2010, the eighth album Falling Down a Mountain was released on 4AD / Constellation Records with a changed band line-up, with Earl Harvin replacing Belhom on drums and David Kitt, a solo artist in his own right, joining the band on guitar and vocals.

&gt; The group's ninth album The Something Rain was released in February 2012.

&gt; As well as their nine studio albums, the band has produced the soundtracks for four films by the French director Claire Denis: Nenette et Boni,Trouble Every Day, 35 Rhums and White Material
They recorded a cover of the Four Tops song, ""What Is A Man"", for the theme to the British TV series The Sins.
The Tindersticks song Tiny Tears was featured prominently in the Series 1 episode ""Isabella"" of HBO's The Sopranos. Additionally, a version of ""Running Wild"" was played during the ending credits of the penultimate episode of the series, ""The Blue Comet"". In the Season One Finale of Brotherhood, ""El Diablo En El Ojo"" is used twice.

&gt;     * Tindersticks (aka First Album) (This Way Up, 1993)
    * Tindersticks (aka Second Album) (This Way Up, 1995)
    * Curtains (This Way Up, 1997)
    * Simple Pleasure (Island, 1999)
    * Can Our Love... (Beggar's Banquet, 2001)
    * Waiting for the Moon (Beggar's Banquet, 2003)

I explicitly stated why I thought villain was likely not aware of what the GTO decision tree looks like in that spot due to his poor hand selection to run this 'exploit' with.

I disagree with the sentiment that any form of poker is 'all about absurd exploitative play'.

&gt; WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord by May 12 but exactly how he will do so remains unclear, two White House officials and a source familiar with the administration&amp;#039;s internal debate said on Wednesday.

&gt; There is a chance Trump might choose to keep the United States in the international pact under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, in part because of &amp;quot;Alliance maintenance&amp;quot; with France and to save face for French President Emmanuel Macron, who met Trump last week and urged him to stay in, the source said.

&gt; A presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday about what he said was documentary evidence of Tehran&amp;#039;s past nuclear arms program could give Trump a fresh argument to withdraw, even though U.N. inspectors say Iran has complied with the terms of the deal.

Now, if these current changes in temperature occured over millions of years, then the jurassic comparison would stand, but we're talking time scales of millions of years of gradual change versus hundreds of years of rapid change. Vulnerable life forms can evolve to cope with the former, but not the latter; simply not enough time to alter their physiology through evolution. As for the greeness/fertility thing: 1) humans have cut down A LOT of trees (north America's boreal forest was dense af pre-major human activity) and 2) fertility is relative (can't say the environmental conditions that existed back then are suitable for plant life today). While the jurassic conditions were more ""extreme"" than today's conditions, life back then was built to cope with such conditions while today's life is not.

As for the European agriculture point, you are right, Humans can thrive in a changing environment. We can also survive in the arctic We can also go to the moon. And we plan to go to mars eventually. We are not a typical case. The things we can adapt to are immeasurable, and so what works for us isn't necessarily what works for all species. It's self-biased to think otherwise.

The South European population I'm assuming for Sephardic Jews is Spanish (for obvious reasons) and Tuscans for Ashkenazi Jews (based on IBD analysis).

Tuscans already have some Near-Eastern ancestry thanks to the Etruscans, so if that's the source population, it would mean a small slice of Ashkenazi Jews' near-eastern ancestry is really Etruscan.

In between the “normal” posts like owls or the beach, there are oddly politically charged posts to world news, Europe, and T_D. The sources always with a hyper sensationalized title, little actual analysis, and typically driving a political point. I know that sounds like most people with their bias, but the next thing I look for is the narratives that are being promoted. People can have a wide variety of interests, but how many of those do you typically lurk in vs remain active in? Also, when FB released their data of Russian ads and activity, it wasn’t really surprising to see their accounts running the gambit and testing the waters in a variety of communities. There’s not so much a singular narrative they’re pushing, but rather exploring how different communities can be leveraged into an activity.

Comments are trickier since they come off as real, but these can be filtered responses. Again looking at how often comments are made and the intensity of them. Lots of ad hominem, bringing in Russian media articles when it makes little sense to, and attacking ideologies in threads it makes no sense to. 

Now these are all superficial, at-first-glance things, but they’re usually good identifiers for potential bot accounts. My work involves monitoring CEE for Russian propaganda and news activity, I see a lot of the same narratives in this account that I find in kremlin media. If it’s not a bot, it’s certainly someone who drank the kool-aid and liked the taste.

Edit: I’m just going to add on that these are what I look for and what I’ve been trained to look for. Others will have more sure fire ways and of course there will be real people who’s own interests and activities can mirror those of bots or prescribed agendas.

I never regretted learning Latin because I find it everywhere around me on a daily basis. As an English speaker, Latin is the root of close to fifty percent of my vocabulary, including many of our prefixes. It also continues to be used within the context of English discourse as an efficient means of expression: et cetera, versus, quid pro quo, am/pm, just to name a few.
Many Latin quotations and idioms have translated into English as well but keep their forms: buyer beware, fortune favors the brave, seize the day. As others have said, many of these common quotes come from ancient literature that is just as relevant and entertaining as modern books, and I personally have truly enjoyed reading the opinions of people who lived 2000 years ago.

On that note, part of learning Latin is learning Roman culture. This explains the roots of many western practices- trial by jury, apartment buildings, stadium seating, food stamps, wearing certain colors to major life events (ie black at funerals), republican government (republic is a pair of Latin words meaning ""the public affair""). Some of these can be found in Ancient Greek culture, too, but the Romans popularized them across Europe. As the conquerors of the Mediterranean, they internalized and spread the culture of people who embraced Roman life- a good example is how Christianity spread like wildfire because of Roman territory, colonies, and soldiers. The language and architecture spread as well, carried across Europe and then to the Americas by Europeans. Look around Washington DC- it is intentionally modeled after the Roman forum, down to the presidential statue of George Washington in a Roman toga, because the United States adopted Roman systems of law and government.

All that said, I hate to admit it, but I feel very much that I am in a dying profession as a Latin teacher, because so few people (especially young students) know anything about Latin or see any reason to study it. Yes, we can speak it out loud and pretend that that is worth doing, but honestly it is not going to have a resurgence as a spoken language, so if the only value people see in language is being able to have a conversation on vacation or close a business deal with a foreign investor, Latin will become a lost art in the near future.

Your logic is incredibly flawed. By that logic, because you were shite when we were winning everything, we cannot also class United as the ""best English team in history."" 

I'm going by the value of trophies won. Lets be honest, domestic trophies mean nothing to giants of world football like United and Liverpool. The UCL is the greatest and hardest trophy that any team in Europe can win and we've won 2 (maybe 3 if we get lucky) more than them.

False,BigShlongKong,,,,"Wow! Well first of all thank you. Clearly a well thought out, well informed  and well reasoned response and I appreciate that. It’s nice to hear a non-caricaturized take on it. Bit yeah I’m a student here. I’m actually studying public policy so you can imagine how central a theme Brexit plays in my courses.

So from my outside perspective I’ve been in the stay camp, but I’m not terribly well educated on the subject. But for the sake of argument I’ll question a couple points you bring up.

So your first point. The EU may very well be headed by people comfortable with acting against the citizens wishes, but it’s my understanding that EU is constructed with fairly decent checks and balances (similar to the US 3 branches of gov.) and is fairly democratic in nature, representatives from all nations having to come to an agreement before policy is enacted. Is this enough to check the potential abuses by those who head it?

I may be misunderstanding your point about the Eurozone, but a) isn’t England relatively sheltered from the Eurozone by using the Pound and b) doesn’t calling for more integration as you have run counter to the entire Brexit movement?

I tentatively agree with democracy breaking down with scale. I think our current systems don’t take the apathy inducing effect of big, centralized gov into account. There needs to be a balance stricken between local, national, and supranational authority. Some hybrid form of community sovereignty under the umbrella of powerful central gov would be ideal (but maybe a pipe dream). EU participation is a loss of national sovereignty by nature I’d argue, but I think it’s necessary as a response to the global nature of corporations. Take the EU regulation on data protection and privacy, which would’ve been difficult (impossible?) to recreate across all individual nations. EU participation also seems better than the alternative of your nation not having a say at the EU negotiation tables (this is the Norway model I think?).  So in a sense the UK is restricting its political options or sovereignty by leaving.

So the EU is surely a protectionist operation, but on the other side of that coin, it wields pretty extraordinary collective bargaining powers in terms of trade agreements with other nations. The UK market alone just can’t compete with single European market. Doesn’t necessarily justify it, but the US certainly practices protectionist economics as well. It’s the norm rather than the exception I’d say. Global market inequality goes beyond the EU, and frankly, I don’t have an answer for how to solve it.

As for flooded job markets, I’ll take your word on it as I don’t know the details. I would say that this seems to be a problem elsewhere as traditional manual/industrial jobs in the west lose out to automation and offshoring. Again, I don’t have an answer.

I’m not sure if I get exactly how the services bit relates to Brexit. Has there been a population rise in the U.K. due to the job market flooding and brain drain effects?

But I definitely agree with your point on the brain drain effect. I’m actually a duel citizen of Latvia which has suffered massive population loss in the last 20 years or so. I have a lot of friends that left Latvia for Uni and never came back, or just left to find better wages. I think EU membership  is certainly an enabler of this, but I also think the devastation that the ‘08 economic collapse caused there shouldn’t be understated. At the time it was a nation with just five years in the EU, and maybe 8 years out of the post-USSR lawlessness of the 1990s. It was in no way ready to react to and recover from the ‘08 collapse, in ways that more developed nations were. This would have been true regardless of EU membership and those who found success and education after the collapse may not have without an EU passport.
I’d also point out that I have friends who did return to Latvia, some of whom work at Latvian based multinationals and conduct business in other EU nations including the UK. EU policy is benefiting the nation in that sense. 

But still,brain-drain is a difficult issue, one that’s repeated in US urbanization and the decrepitation of  small rural communities.  It is being addressed though. Say what you will about the Trump tax plan but it does include a new policy that doesn’t tax community development projects until they’re economically sustainable, aiming to promote regrowth in small communities. It’ll be interesting to see if it works. 

 I’m trying to say that there are tactics to deal with it, which brings me to my last point. I think we’d agree that the EU needs reform. It isn’t perfect. But the UK has seemingly given up its voice in any potential reforms. I don’t see the nation holding the same sway post Brexit. The vote to leave seems like a protest vote. Which feels good but doesn’t get you too far as it seems to me.

But even if we take all of your arguments against the EU as entirely correct (and I think they are or could be to a large extent), is the alternative better? Is an independent UK better off, economically or geopolitically, than the UK as an EU member? If so, does the massive uncertainty and use of political resources (to the hinderance of other government action) justify that? And lastly, does the UK leaving put an end to the issues with the EU that you point out?

So apologies for dragging on so long, and no worries if you don’t want to answer all or any of it, I’m just curious to hear another perspective on this, and hopefully learn a lot myself as I already have through your first post.

Bloodletting (or blood-letting) is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease. Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as ""humours"" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years. In Europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century.

I'm thankful for vaping, because I know its helped me be healthier and more active than the 7 years I primarily smoked from '04-11, but at the same time, when I'm home, I'm usually vaping, and starting in a month, I'll be taking care of a newborn full time, so I'm going to have to stop, and its going to be a bitch. I'm going to buy my own patches, rather than go to the clinic, and just take it at my own pace (tried the free clinic but they push you, and I know me, and my problem isn't quitting week one, the three days of pain, or any of that, but months 3~4 is where I get very agitated, and have relapsed 6 times now. Usually when it rains I really want to smoke/vape). Anyway, upvote again. good advice.

False,ProfVerstrooid,,,,"There are poor whites. But the vast majority of whites have a far higher living standard than most blacks. I live in Cape Town, not in any rural area where all the poor whites are, so I couldn't tell you how many there are. 
But I do know that there are hundreds upon thousand of poor blacks just outside my city who need urgent help from the government. Most of them have no qualifications for work because they were denied school and were forced to live an impoverished life under apartheid while most whites were benefited from the system. There are ten times more poor black people than poor white people in South Africa and far more violent crime in poor black residential areas than in white areas.

Our country is now focused on redressing the poverty experienced by blacks first, then the Coloured's (mixed race South Africans), then the Indians ( who were brought here as indentured labourers) and finally the whites. Some whites feel that this is unlawful discrimination but it's the country's priority to equally redistribute the nation's income this way, because it is the only way to ensure the economic and political stability of the entire country. Black people make up more than 80% of the population, while white people are barely 8%. If we were a wealthy nation and never had apartheid then we would never need to place priorities on ethnicity.

The goal is to redistribute the wealth so that the ìncome distribution equals the ethnic make up of the country. As it stands, black people have yet to own 70% of the capital. None of the redistribution of property has thus far been done unfairly since it is based on a willing buyer/ willing seller principle. 
As for employment, our country's unemployment rate is higher than 27% 
with many black areas having far more than 60% unemployment rates.  During apartheid, black people were denied a full education above Grade 9 and ten times more money was funded to school white kids instead of black kids. Although school is legally equal for all South Africans, the fact is that there is still a major economic disparity between whites and blacks since impoverished blacks can't afford the university education that most whites are able to afford. 

So companies are given merit for employing more black people, but they aren't forced to deny skilled white people - it's up to the business who they want.

I do think that white nationalist movements in America and Europe  capitalize on the perceived racial discrimination against white South Africans to fuel their agendas, and I think it an important cause to protect minorities (white South Africans) but the fact is that black people have it really bad still, worse compared to whites and White nationalist movements overexaggerate the issue and forget that South Africa is a developing nation with many diverse issues, of which white discrimination makes up a small prioirity (given our past), although the white issue does not go unignored.",True,False,0,1525327081,,1525328621,0,dydaavq,True,t3_8giast,True,t1_dyc8seu,/r/DeFranco/comments/8giast/white_supremacist_group_in_south_africa_linked_to/dydaavq/,,1527021999,5,False,True,False,DeFranco,t5_2si6m,public,

I think it was some Chinese emperor that said something along the lines ""Peasants are like weed. You cut them down and they grow again"". Talk about replaceable workers. 

Architectural: I think there is deeper theme, that of the overall culture. From my trips around the world I see USA and Germany as very pragmatic societies that are tailored for the needs of middle class. They do things efficiently for greater number of people. So no artsy intersections and street lamps like in Barcelona but probably more of them for the same cost. You are blinded by that.

False,JoeK76,points,,11,"&gt; Would I have to register for VAT and pay VAT considering they are all low cost - mostly under £10 - and all shipped by a seperate supplier.

The cost of the item is immaterial, Tesco has to apply VAT to a 60p bag of crisps. In the UK you have to register for VAT once your turnover exceeds £85,000/year. AFAIK the UK has one of the more generous VAT thresholds, most European countries have much lower thresholds.

**However** what matters is the destination country. Since it sounds like you're running an e-commerce business you'd have to apply the VAT rate of the destination country (where your customer is located) and file the relevant declarations once the distance selling thresholds have been exceeded in a particular EU country.  There's no VAT on exports outside the EU, so your US and Canada sales would not be subject to it. You should really talk to a professional about that, because the subject is non-trivial. 

&gt; am I able to as a UK citizen register a business abroad, set up a bank account there and only pay there taxes

Technically yes, you could do that. You'd still be liable for UK income tax on any profits that you take out of the company as long as you're tax-resident in the UK, and you might run into a situation where HMRC considers that your foreign company has a UK branch or office, and will want to charge corporation tax on the profits of your UK activities.

**However** you'll need to look into whether that's really cost effective. The UK has one of the lowest tax rates in Europe, and one of the most straight forward taxation systems, almost anywhere else will be more paperwork and you might end up having to employ a full-time accountant to help run your business.

&gt;my understanding that EU is constructed with fairly decent checks and balances (similar to the US 3 branches of gov.) and is fairly democratic in nature.. 

In theory yes. In practice less so.

The commission drafts all law including the power to propose new bills. Often large piles of documents are handed to parliament members hours before they vote - so unless something has been flagged they vote without reading it (the US and many national parliaments already have the same problem). Each individual policy is not enough to be worth kicking up a fuss but combined they make up huge swathes of national and international law. This also loops back to my points on unnecessary centralisation of power, EU leaning representatives and democracy breaking down at scale. 

&gt;a) isn’t England relatively sheltered from the Eurozone by using the Pound

We're heavily tied to EU economic performance both through policy, trade and financial commitments (EU budgets are decided in euros for example). 

&gt;b) doesn’t calling for more integration as you have run counter to the entire Brexit movement?

I'm saying the euro cannot survive without considerably more EU integration. It was introduced before it made sense specifically to force this. I voted to leave in part because I don't want further integration and I don't see a route where we remained a member and it did not happen. 

&gt;Take the EU regulation on data protection and privacy, which would’ve been difficult (impossible?) to recreate across all individual nations.

You can standardise regulation by negotiation of members rather than a central authority. Either through a proposal from a single/group [of] nation[s] to others or via formation of a committee which issues a proposal. Look at the UN, NATO, international human rights laws etc. 

&gt;EU participation also seems better than the alternative of your nation not having a say at the EU negotiation tables

If they (either member or EU wide) propose something mutually beneficial we run with it. If they don't we don't. If they won't agree to something mutually beneficial then you have to ask yourself why? (usually the answer is they don't want other members to consider leaving - at that point it's basically a protection racket).

&gt;on the other side of that coin, it wields pretty extraordinary collective bargaining powers in terms of trade agreements with other nations

I would love for it to go back to the trade organisation we actually voted to join.

&gt;The UK market alone just can’t compete with single European market

Only because of protectionism. If you believe we will eventually end up with global marketplace then the EU (and Trumps US) are a step backwards.

&gt;traditional manual/industrial jobs in the west lose out to automation and offshoring.

For factory jobs sure. For locksmiths, plumbers, nurses, construction workers, electricians and farm workers less so. These workers have seen their pay stagnate whilst their colleagues are now in majority Eastern European - its fairly obvious the cause of this change (*I reworded from problem to change - it is debatable) is open migration.

&gt;Has there been a population rise in the U.K. 

EU migrants make up 6-10% of the population). Net EU migration has skyrocketed since 2004 when freedom of movement extended to Cyprus, Malta and much of Eastern Europe. Services have not scaled at a comparable rate - partially though our own policy but there are also major staff shortages. These problems are exaggerated because migrants tend to move to major urban areas.

This has also caused integration problems. A large number of people from a different culture moving into the same area over a short amount of time end up forming their own communities.

&gt; I also think the devastation that the ‘08 economic collapse caused there shouldn’t be understated.

I don't doubt it. Although I'd argue its ability to recover was stunted considerably further by the highest earners fleeing elsewhere.

&gt;some of whom work at Latvian based multinationals and conduct business in other EU nations including the UK

Sure. But I'd argue as much as free trade has helped Latvias businesses losing their best talent has stunted it. As above I'd love to go back to the trade organisation the EU used to be.

There is also the issue of what that work is. I work in software. Some of the best engineers I work with are from Romania and Bulgaria. Were they to go back leveraging UK experience would allow them to live like Kings. The problem is the projects they would work on are nowhere near as interesting. They'd be working at effectively cheap maintainance houses - new projects are run in wealthier nations both for IP reasons and because they know the best engineers leave for the UK/Germany etc.

&gt;the UK has seemingly given up its voice in any potential reforms

The people running it are marching towards further integration. The UK is far more sceptic than the majority of EU nations and of those with similar views many have a bigger financial incentive to run with it (Poland for example). For me it feels like the only way to get reform is collapse - even if that comes with substantial cost in the short term. 

&gt;Is an independent UK better off, economically or geopolitically, than the UK as an EU member?

As it currently stands no - but there is more to quality of life than economic and geopolitical standing. Meanwhile as the EU continues it feels like the costs are growing at a substantially higher rate than the benefits.

&gt;does the UK leaving put an end to the issues with the EU that you point out?

Some yes. Others no. My ideal end goal is major EU reform and us rejoining. But I voted leave fully accepting the EU may succeed on its current path - and even if I believed with certainty it would I'd still want to be outside of it.

I believe Cech is working off an injury? Not sure... but Wenger confirmed Ospina is starting. Shame, I'd rather have Cech in this match.

The defence is the strongest it can be with this line-up. Yes, both Mustafi and Kos make mistakes, but lets not pretend any of the young lads in the team are better than them yet.

I think I would have rather had Elneny over Wilshere for balance, but that isn't possible so these boys need to give there all and dominate the centre of the pitch.

This is a massive match for Ozil, he will be the game changer. If he is at his best I think that will help Arsenal out perform Atletico.

Mkhitaryan needs to be at his attacking best in order to prove the extra goal threat we were missing in the first leg.

Lacazette, please for the love of god just bang in a hattrick.

I'm nervous, I feel sick to the stomach, but this is my team... our team.

Para quem não sabe, vender pão requer acordar de madrugada para o enviar fresco para as lojas (e ele não dura mais do que uma semana, na maior parte dos casos). Quando comecei a gerir a padaria, a primeira mudança que fiz foi ao horário de trabalho. Coloquei cinco (nos quais me incluo) a fazer o trabalho mais duro das 4 às 9 da manhã, e instruí-los a manterem um horário de refeições e de sono regular, de preferência se deitando cedo e não dormirem durante o dia a horas irregulares. Os outros quatro, coloquei a trabalhar às 8:30 a embalar os produtos.

As alterações iniciais que eu fiz ao sistema e ao horário de trabalho tinham em conta a estabilidade mental dos empregados. Eu observei-os um a um, fiz uma avaliação das aptidões e preferências de cada um deles, e tentei agrupá-los do jeito que resultaria no melhor trabalho de equipa. Tudo isso, para reduzir o stress e a carga mental do trabalho.

Apenas três meses depois, estão todos gratos pelo novo sistema, andam com sorrisos na cara, dão-se melhor uns com os outros, queixam-se menos das condições de trabalho, e os produtos estão a sair com melhor qualidade. Hoje até produzimos o dobro do costume.

Goal of the Guild: Extend our roster and create a 2nd competitive guild. 3 members of original BsK guild will be in this new guild. Take note that this 2nd Guild won't be a ""B team"", the two guilds will be balanced!

About us: We're an active guild and we want to keep going to the top and of course share some great moments together, in game and on our Guild line/discord servers too.
We can all speak an ""ok"" english so feel free to pm me even if you're not french (some of us only speak english), as long as you want to join our jolly fellows team !

Criteria: We look for ACTIVE players, semi-whale/whale in priority BUT if you have a well rounded account as a F2P, you're welcome too! What you should keep in mind is that we need a player that fits well with our squad ;)

Around thirties R4 weapons would be great, 1 or 2 R5 would be awesome, and very good versatility amongs all elements is required. Top 3 or 5 in last ranking events would be nice too. Don't hesitate and feel free to pm me if you're interested!

I didn't claim that.

&gt;The only Brexit that right now can be honestly claimed to have had a democratic majority vote for it is to leave the EU's political union. This would be to step back to EEA membership.

Not true, you can also reasonably claim that the official (and virtually all the unofficial) Leave campaign groups promoted leaving the EU, SM and CU. You could also claim that many voted for this based on numerous comments from Remain supporting politicians (Including Cameron, Osborne etc.) that leaving the EU would ""put the UK outside the single market and customs union"".

&gt;The people simply were not asked about those. 

They were not *explicitly* asked this on the ballot, true. Guess what, they were also not *explicitly* asked whether they wanted to stay in the single market or customs union either. You can't claim that hard brexit has no mandate, and then ignore the exact same argument when stating that the only mandate is for a soft brexit.

&gt;I was fairly certain Blair also presided over an unprecedented increase in non-EU migration. Figures seem to back that out.

Non-EU migration did increase substantially yes.

But what was it due to?
Simplistically, a lot of it (non-EU migration) was due to the arrival of China on to the open world and Chinese students coming to the UK to study. 

I've given the link to UK gov source data below. To quote that paper: 
""*Study was the most common main reason for immigration during the period 2009-12, and the reduction in the number of people migrating to the UK to study since then reflects a reduction in the number of Tier 4 student visas issued to students from outside the EEA and Switzerland.*""
In fact annually 200-300k of immigrants to study. 
Immigration for work (which is probably EU migration) did peak about 250k by the end of Labour government and has then peaked *higher* at about 300k in 2016 under Conservatives....
(Look at charts 9 and 10 in the linked source.)

Is this the massive immigration problem that concerns you? A load of students (currently running at approx 200k) and annual work immigration currently running about 150k. (See chart 10 for longer term entry clearance visas.) Really? In a country of 60+ million...?


So did Blair ""preside"" over it? 
Well yes he and Labour were in government at the time. But what did he ""preside"" over? 
Well he ""presided"" over a large increase in the success of the UK further education sector I suppose... 
(You'll note I've carefully put ""preside"" in quotes. Because it's a value-laden word which I think you intentionally intended to imply blame and an element of haughty, uncaring leadership.)

Suddenly when you look at the statistics, rather than just reading the Daily Mail, then you understand that:
a/ things are complex rather than black and white
b/ statistics are often complex and, unless careful, misleading

It is a major meat in only a few countries, notably in Central Asia, but it forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many others, from Europe to South America to Asia. The top eight countries consume about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of humanity's early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein.

The Conquest of the Desert (Spanish: Conquista del desierto) was a military campaign directed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s with the intent to establish Argentine dominance over Patagonia, which was inhabited by indigenous peoples. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of Chilean expansion there.

Argentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. Ethnic European settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a breadbasket that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century.

If they maintain the same schedule, on the other hand, Asia will get a 15th box but EU will get the shaft. This also allows for an extra 35-70 coins to be farmed.

False,nan_adams,,,,"While I do think it’s a visual nod to the existence of Roman World, I don’t think it’s an out of place artifact or anachronistic for the time period. Keep in mind that Westworld does not follow a linear history of the west and any attempt to hone in on a particular decade or location as a real world equivalent is futile. The show layers history and blends it with pop culture to create an amalgamation of “the West”. 

But... we can use real world examples to defend the bust’s place in Westworld. To start, the statue would not be out of place in an antebellum Southern home of the plantation class. Grand tours of Europe were common for the upper echelon of Southern society as was art collecting. You can see a great example of this at the Aiken Rhett house in Charleston SC. The home has a separate art gallery with numerous paintings and sculptures the family picked up during their European travels, including a sculpture “the Venus D’Italica” by Canova. 

Now that we’ve established that the bust isn’t out of place let’s look at how it could get into the hands of the Confederados and it’s involvement in the war in general.

Both Union and Confederate armies used Hardee’s Rifle and Light Infantry tactics as a supplies guideline for soldiers covering everything from various foods to ammunition. As the war raged on it became increasingly difficult to maintain the standards set in Hardee’s book, especially for the South as supply lines had been cut due to blockades and literally cut rail lines. On the Union side, General Sherman actually cut off his supply line after sacking Atlanta and turned his men to a live off the land policy outlined in Special Field Order 120, which established a foraging unit. The goal was utter destruction of Southern resources in an effort to cripple the south and force a quick surrender. We know from firsthand accounts that this involved looting and destruction of property. This is not to say that Confederate troops did not loot - they did as well, perhaps not at the scope of Sherman and his men. Following the war Congress established the Southern Claims Commission, which processed claims of property loss and damage at the hands of union troops. However, the claims process yielded a low percentage of results and was limited to southern union loyalists.  

Confederados were southern emigres to Brazil. The emperor of Brazil, Don Pedro II, setup agencies throughout the South to advertise cheap land and cheap passage, and at this point Brazil had not yet abolished slavery. It was a lucrative alternative to living under northern rule during reconstruction and about 20k southerners headed south. This included Confederate officers, who would have been of a slave owning, plantation owning class. They saw an opportunity to rebuild the plantation system that had been destroyed by the war. This was as much about economic gain as it was about not wanting to face defeat on a psychological level. 

My long winded point is ... whether they originally owned the statue, acquired it through looting, won it via a claim from the SCC, or emigrated with it in their possession there’s enough evidence to support the bust’s place with the Confederados. From a narrative perspective it would make sense why they would cling to an object symbolic of their antebellum life and view it as evidence of their superiority.",True,False,0,1525357230,,False,0,dyds8ce,False,t3_8gprji,True,t3_8gprji,/r/westworld/comments/8gprji/an_outofplace_artifact_in_2x02/dyds8ce/,,1527032371,4,False,True,False,westworld,t5_2xhxq,public,

Any oil revenue reduces the size of the fiscal transfer. But £9.5 billion in a bad year and £7 billion in a good year still isn't an argument in favour of independence.

&gt;That plus the winding down of austerity and improved growth will all affect GERS in favour of independence in coming years.

Increased growth and increased spending will both increase the size of the fiscal transfer. Only if Scotland grows faster than the rest of the UK will the fiscal transfer shrink.

&gt;Perhaps it makes short term economic sense for those that can't see the big picture and can't think beyond GDP. 

It's not about GDP. It's about Scotland losing £1,800 per person per year in public sector revenue. That means either massive tax rises, spending cuts, or a combination of the two.

&gt;Independence is important for me. Not just for my country but for me personally and for my family and community, I believe people thrive when they are empowered and in control of their lives. So yes, I guess there is a little ideology from my perspective. Not however 'at any cost' as some have suggested to me in the past.

Fair enough. I wouldn't tell anyone they shouldn't vote for independence. That's a choice everyone in Scotland must make for themselves. However, I think it's wrong to minimise the consequences.

&gt;I think the (short term) economy is the one argument Unionism has. 

It's not a short term argument. There are aspects that would make it much worse in the short term, eg changing the currency, border inconveniences affecting trade etc. 

However, there are also long term effects. The loss of the £9.5 billion fiscal transfer is not a short term thing. It's a permanent loss in income that will continue to affect Scotland for the foreseeable future. It's possible that Scotland would eventually make up the difference through higher growth, but it's equally possible that lower growth would make the loss even larger. 

In fact, as the UK has averaged significantly faster growth than the rest of western Europe since 1980, the likelihood is that long term the effect of losing Barnett would increase, not diminish.

I am not really focused on what would be politically possible at the moment, this is more just what I would do if I had the power. Or maybe something that would be possible down the line. 

&gt; Not to mention the problems liberals like myself would have with this, because you'd be encouraging nationalism and cutting down on illegal immigration now, and then legal immigration later

Is cutting down on *illegal* immigration bad? Either way, I'm not for cutting down on legal immigration and, as I said before, I completely understand the benefits of having immigrants in the country. I am for eliminating illegal immigration though. 

&gt; America is America specifically because we let people be different

I agree, our differences are what made this country great. I am not asking for people to give up the food or culture of their home country, I am just asking that they adapt to the culture here. That requires just three things: Speak English, get involved with the community, and demonstrate knowledge of local customs. You can do these things while still celebrating the traditions of where you came from. 

&gt; I don't think you can use this argument, because now that I know what your personal stance is, I can just run with your ""it's OK to be a hypocrite"" argument.

I'm not really being a hypocrite. I have no intention of ever living in Switzerland for long periods of time. Having a Swiss passport is more of a strategic thing for business or in case something goes wrong in America (hopefully not though). If I were to move there I would 100% be speaking French and living a Swiss lifestyle. 

&gt; It's a homeowner's association, and that's not a good thing. I don't like unnecessary and toxic regulatory capture, and that's what you're arguing for

I see the problem with this. It is dangerous to have a group of people decide what is considered integrated or what is not. This could possibly be addressed by having a non-partisan group decide measures? I guess I'll give you a delta for this point, congrats. 

&gt; OK, and then you completely ignored the economic realities argument that I laid out. That's the argument that's why immigration happens. I'd implore you to consider that option.

I've said before that the current economic realities in Europe and the US probably do necessitate immigration. I am just saying that if you move to these places *and* want to be a citizen, you need to integrate. There is no reason you cannot have immigration and integration. 

As for all of your refutations to my statistics on dangers in Europe because of third-world immigration, it is *possible* that there are other causes. However, like I said in my last comment, the bulk of the migrants are not families, they are young men who are statistically more likely to commit crime than any other demographic. When you add that they come from countries with far less progressive views on women's rights, LGBT rights, etc., it makes sense that there is an increase in crime and migrants are the likely cause. Do you think having these men come into Europe in such high numbers would have no negative impact on crime levels or the culture whatsoever? There are plenty of anecdotal examples of these negative changes, but a lot of companies and governments are avoiding doing studies on migrant crime for fear of being called racist. 

Also, [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5446435/Angela-Merkel-admits-no-areas-Germany.html) is another source about Angela Merkel claiming there are no-go zones in Germany. Do you think her claim has legitimacy? 

&gt; But it's not though, because America has 30 million illegal immigrants, and from what I can tell about your argument, you don't care if there are illegal immigrants in a country

Don't make assumptions, I do have strong opinions on illegal immigration. These responses are just getting pretty long and I'd rather avoid going on tangents as my main concern in this post is legal immigration. For the record, I am *strongly* opposed to illegal immigration, but I am *strongly* for legal immigration. 

&gt; In America, if your ""integration"" standards were applied, it's just the flow of politics that would guarantee lower legal immigration.

I honestly do not think integration policies would slow the flow of legal immigrants. The waiting list to get into the country is already very long and if some people leave it because of the new measures others will fill their place. Also, if someone plans to come to the country and become a citizen but they do not want to integrate, I would rather they do not come at all. Keep in mind, the integration standards I have provided, based on Switzerland's, are not that strict and most people who have immigrated to the country in the past have probably already fulfilled them naturally. It is really just to target those who want to insulate themselves in a cultural enclave. 

&gt; I would've definitely appreciated clarification.

Sorry, my bad. No hard feelings.

He takes much more responsibility in the build up by being much more comfortable dropping deeper and dictating. He's also now pretty comfortable running in behind the defence, which has led to quite a few goals for Arsenal - just watch his goal against Ludogorets early last season, no way would Real Madrid Ozil do that. He will also drift very wide and cause overloads on the wing, often allowing the winger to drift inside into the box. He's far more dynamic and spread across the pitch, whereas I'd say Real Madrid Ozil was very happy to spend a good chunk of the game in the half-space waiting for the ball.

It's much, much harder to mark Ozil out of game nowadays. He used to be almost strictly a final third player, and that's where his main strengths still lie, but he's so much more now. He only really has issues getting the ball now when the team can't keep the ball under a high press deep in our own half, as in we can't get out of our own defensive third, and there are only a few teams capable of pressing at that level. Even then, he'll sometimes drop almost to the edge of our own penalty area now to get the ball forwards.

As a team, Arsenal can certainly still do more to help him, but I'd say it's more personnel than tactics per se - we seriously lacked creativity in the first half of this season, putting way too much burden on Ozil. The arrival of Mkhi has certainly taken some of the burden off of Ozil, and he looks a lot more dangerous when they play together.

False,Human-Infinity,na clg,,,"Aren't you averaging the points for regions that send multiple teams though? Unless I'm mistaken, this can potentially skew in favor of regions that send fewer teams.

Consider this potential Worlds case (ignoring COEFFs):

Region 1 sends 3 teams that get the following placements:

&gt; Team 1: 3-3 groups, don't advance = 5 points

&gt; Teams 2 and 3: 1-5 in groups, don't advance = 3 points each

Region 2 sends 1 team that goes 2-4 and doesn't advance = 4 points

Averaging it out, we get 3.66666.. points for region 1 and 4 points for region 2. This suggests that region 2 is stronger than region 1. The problem is that the best team from region 1 did better than the best team from region 2, and since region 2 only sent 1 team, we don't know how strong or weak the rest of the region is. For all we know, the 2 and 3 seeds from region 2 would have gone 0-6, thus giving the region only 1.33333.. points.

The best example of this is Albus NoX Luna getting 9 points for the LCL at 2016 Worlds, giving it the 2nd most points out of all the regions. Of course no one thinks that the LCL is better than EU, especially when ANX lost 3-0 to H2K. The discrepancy comes from the fact that EU was dragged down by G2 and Splyce, yet ANX, a single great team, didn't have any of the other (much worse) LCL teams to drag down their score as well. If the LCL had sent their 2nd and 3rd seeds like the EU did, then it would have had a much lower score.

If you want to get him something non-Japanese, I would recommend straying away from Islay or other peat-heavy Scotches, since Japanese whisky is incredibly smooth (more similar to Irish whiskey) and something heavy like that may not be his cup of tea. As for what Scotch/Irish whiskey/bourbon to get him, there are endless possibilities.

If you want to disregard the whisk(e)y route and just go for Japanese liquor, I have about 1,001 other recommendations for you.

But without getting into too much detail let's break ""Great Power"" into two categories...1. military strength and 2. economic. With this in mind economic strength is growing in strength as a method of power exertion. The idea of direct military conflict between two Great Powers as a method of power exertion has not disappeared but has considerably diminished...nuclear weapons and MAD (mutually assured destruction) is the leading reason. This does not exempt wars between great powers, they almost always play out through proxy wars now. And power-exertion via military means is more than just great-powers duking it out, the U.S. military and other strong military powers still have great influence and that will be true.

But it's difficult to ignore the growing role of economic power...especially in terms of China and India and long-existing world powers such the U.S. . In many ways military power can be seen as a ancillary necessity to protect the enormous power of national/international economic order. And the economic power has enormous influence on its own without the threat of military power ever coming into play (I.e. sanctions, trade deals etc.). 

Nations with strong economies can influence regional politics and dynamics in enormous ways. 

With that being said...you'll usually find global power rankings an order similar to the following:

1. U.S. (this first spot is uncontested) 
2. China (Everything points to China eventually taking the #1 spot, but this is a point of contest.) 
3. Russia (Much smaller economy compared to others on list, exertion is military and willingness to use it, influence over energy sustainability in the E.U., modes of soft power, lacks powerful alliances)

In Canada, Vancouver and Toronto are safe and affluent cities which are minority white. The Iranians in particular are a model immigrant group with high achievement. Even the whites have a high proportion of immigrants amongst their numbers. The funny thing is that whites complain about Asians being too rich and driving up housing prices, rather than Asians bringing crime and filth. 

The Bay Area also has massive south and east Asian populations in its wealthiest and safest areas. 

This may be due to geography - you need to fly to North America from there and that combined with immigration laws means that the people who even try to emigrate tend to be the good ones. The kind of person who can read English documents, apply for a visa, and afford plane tickets is likely to be an educated middle or upper class professional. 

Europe on the other hand accepts a lot of refugees who simply walk or sail over due to proximity. That significantly increases the chance of bad or plain useless ones making it in and imparting their ways onto the next generation.

Therefore, he's in favor of the Holocaust, and the Japanese atrocities in China, because, hey, whatever man. At least you aren't killing some civilians! Let all those other civilians die, at least we aren't killing them!

That's the reality of the situation. In a war, people die. In a total war, the entire population of the enemy country is, in effect, your enemy. Bombing their cities weakens their ability to produce more arms and armaments and weakens their resolve, bringing a faster end to the war and ultimately saving lives. But even in a normal war, you often will end up blowing up civilians while attacking military targets - which the civilians shouldn't be around in the first place.

If a bunch of terrorists are hanging out in a house all the time, and you blow it up, and there's a couple civilians inside as well - too bad, so sad. They shouldn't hang out with terrorists. If the terrorists know they can't hide behind human shields, they're less likely to do so, and if people recognize that hanging out with terrorists is likely to get them bombed, they aren't going to want the terrorists anywhere near them.

Anyone who shrieks about this shit doesn't understand the reality of the situation and doesn't think about the alternatives.

This shit happens.

If they disagree with it, why aren't *they* out going and dealing with this shit?

I mean, they can go join their country's military, or hell, join the US military - you can even get citizenship that way.

The reality is an awful lot of the people who shriek about this are Russians and Russian fellow travelers, people who have been influenced by Russian propaganda from Russian propaganda outlets like Wikileaks. Because the Russians sure as fuck don't care about collateral damage, but they're happy to pretend like ""Oh noes, the Americans are totally evil, man.""

I get that the cowards in Europe were happy to abandon Poland to the Nazis and the Soviets. I get that they were happy to abandon Syria to the Russians and ISIS.

And then they're whiny about ""Oh noes, the Germans invaded France! However could we have predicted this?""

Or ""Oh noes! We are now getting flooded by a bunch of Syrian refugees! This is all America's fault!""

So yeah, saying they're in favor of the Holocaust is legitimate, because that is the logical end point of their stance - that it isn't okay to fight back against shitty people if it means some civilians die in the process.

There was no real preparation for the war as far as well can tell - especially compared to the time it takes to move around the system, even at relatively high accelerations.
The fact that we hear a news report about scrambling more ships to the Jovian AO from Earth and Luna makes it sound like that UNN vessels went into action wherever they were when the balloon went up. There was no time to get the fleets in order before the shooting started.
If random battlegroups just engaged enemy vessels as they were before the war started, it seems likely that the less capable units would take disproportionate losses by virtue of being less capable.

I could buy Errinwright embellishing the UN's position to make it look like Mars was more desperate than it was - but noone tries to correct him so I have to assume the MCRN has taken major losses.

&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; BRASÍLIA --- Alvo de um mandado de prisão nesta quinta-feira na operação ""**Câmbio, Desligo**"", o doleiro **Dário Messer** afirmou, em uma conversa registrada em 2016, ser um ""boi de piranha"" de políticos que o enredaram no escândalo do mensalão, no primeiro governo Lula, e prometia ""colocar a boca no trombone"" contra seus algozes. A conversa com o repórter do GLOBO se deu por um aplicativo de troca de mensagens. Apontado pelos investigadores da Lava-Jato como ""o doleiro dos doleiros"", Messer é considerado o cérebro de um [esquema de lavagem de dinheiro que teria movimentado uma fortuna estimada em US$ 1,652 bilhão](https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/lava-jato-manda-prender-dario-messer-outros-44-doleiros-operadores-22647632).
&gt; 
&gt; -- Estou só aguardando a minha sentença absolvitória para contar minha história. Ela vai se chamar Boi de Piranha! Agora, estou assistindo de camarote esses políticos se ferrarem, entre eles alguns políticos que mandaram o Toninho da Barcelona mentir e outros que tentaram me achacar. A minha vida inteira fiquei quieto sem reagir, não sei se foi bom ou ruim, mas agora falta pouco para a sentença. Aí vou colocar a boca no trombone! -- disse Dário Messer, por meio de mensagens eletrônicas, em 2016.
&gt; 
&gt; Em 2005, durante depoimento na CPI dos Bingos, aberta no Congresso para investigar o esquema do mensalão, o doleiro Toninho da Barcelona detalhou como Messer teria atuado para lavar recursos da campanha do PT. Condenado a 25 anos de prisão por lavagem de dinheiro, Barcelona acusou Messer de enviar dólares do Panamá para sua empresa, a Barcelona Tour.
&gt; 
&gt; O doleiro Barcelona fazia a troca dos dólares de Messer por reais e entregava os valores à corretora Bônus-Banval, que repassava recursos para nomes do PT indicados pelo publicitário Marcos Valério, o operador financeiro do mensalão, condenado em 2012 pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF).
&gt; 
&gt; Dono do codinome ""Cagarras"" no esquema bilionário desbaratado pela Polícia Federal - por causa da luxuosa cobertura que mantém no Leblon, com vista para as ilhas de mesmo nome -, Dário Messer teve a prisão decretada em 2009, durante a operação ""Sexta-feira Treze"", que também investigava crimes de lavagem de dinheiro. O doleiro se dizia vítima de armação de Toninho da Barcelona, porque não tinha ""padrinhos políticos"".
&gt; 
&gt; -- Tenho um único processo, que se chama sexta-feira treze, que foi baseado em mentira contada por Toninho da Barcelona na CPI, falando que eu era doleiro do PT. Você acha que se eu tivesse relações ilícitas com o PT eles não teriam me defendido? Tô falando de CPI de 10 anos atrás, não de hoje em dia. (Depois da Lava-Jato) Deu para perceber que essas CPIs são uma palhaçada. Interessa a eles (os políticos) duas coisas: extorquir pessoas para não irem depor e não saírem no relatório (de indiciados da CPI) e desviar o foco, o chamado boi de piranha. Eu sempre fui ótimo para isso, famoso por minha amizade com o Ronaldo e sem nenhum padrinho politico -- afirmou Messer.
&gt; 
&gt; No ano passado, Messer foi absolvido no processo da Operação Sexta-Feira 13. Até a operação deflagrada nesta quinta-feira pela Polícia Federal, ele não havia cumprido a promessa.
&gt; 
&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; **Ronaldo, Romário e Lula**
&gt; 
&gt; Sobre a amizade com figuras famosas, aliás, Messer guarda um amplo acervo fotográfico. Os ex-jogadores da Seleção Ronaldo e Romário, por exemplo, no auge de suas carreiras, posaram ao lado do doleiro, assim como o próprio ex-presidente Lula. Do líder petista, preso em Curitiba desde 7 de abril, Messer negava proximidade.
&gt; 
&gt; -- A única vez que eu vi esse Lula foi quando estava viajando com o Ronaldo e alguns amigos num avião fretado e encontramos toda a quadrilha num hangar, se não me engano, em Congonhas. Isso acho que foi em 2003. Foi logo quando ele ganhou as eleições -- ponderou.
&gt; 
&gt; Já sobre Ronaldo, Messer revela detalhes de uma amizade supostamente duradoura, marcada por grandes viagens internacionais.
&gt; 
&gt; -- O Ronaldo é meu amigo desde que ele tinha 15 anos. Temos um carinho muito grande um pelo outro. Já fiz várias viagens pelo mundo com ele. Rússia, Israel, Palestina. Estivemos com Nelson Mandela na África do Sul... -- contou.
&gt; 
&gt; Em 2014, quando a Lava-Jato implodiu o grupo de doleiros que atuava a partir do famoso Posto da Torre, em Brasília, do qual fazia parte Alberto Youssef, Messer mudou-se para o Paraguai. Amigo do presidente paraguaio Horacio Cartes, sentia-se livre do risco de prisão no Brasil.
&gt; 
&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; **""Se tivessem falado, já estaria preso""**
&gt; 
&gt; O doleiro entrou no radar da Lava-Jato por suas relações com o advogado Oscar Algorta Rachetti, já indiciado pelo juiz Sergio Moro por também lavar dinheiro para o ex-diretor da área internacional da Petrobras Nestor Cerveró. Dário Messer não esconde suas relações com Algorta, mas nega que usasse os serviços de Algorta para cometer crimes. Messer diz que era apenas um cliente do advogado:
&gt; 
&gt; -- Sou cliente dele (Algorta) há mais de 20 anos. Ele é advogado e monta empresas. Se o meu advogado criminalista fosse advogado do Fernandinho Beira-Mar, isso não me faria sócio de um nem de outro. O Cerveró é outro delator. Será que se tivesse negocio com ele o juiz (Sérgio) Moro não ia saber? Você acha que se fosse verdade (a parceria criminosa com Algorta) nenhum dedo-duro ia falar algo com o juiz Moro? Se tivessem falado, já estaria preso! -- disse Messer.
&gt; 
&gt; Nas investigações da Lava-Jato, Algorta seria apontado como responsável por abrir as empresas (Doucet Finance, Blostock Holding, Greenwood Trust Company, Inversiones Beliver) usadas por Messer para lavar dinheiro no Uruguai. Messer admite apenas que o advogado administrava as empresas.
&gt; 
&gt; -- Ele (Algorta), na verdade, não abriu, mas cuida delas há uns 15 anos. E esse mesmo advogado tinha como cliente o Cerveró, algo que também vim a saber quando saiu o nome dele na Lava-Jato -- diz Messer.
&gt; 
&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; **""Tomei coragem e procurei o Toninho""**
&gt; 
&gt; Fazia parte dos planos de Messer escrever um livro para contar a sua versão dos fatos sobre a acusação de Toninho da Barcelona. Messer pretendia revelar nomes de políticos que o prejudicaram e teria, inclusive, conversas com o próprio Toninho da Barcelona que supostamente ""limpariam seu nome"".
&gt; 
&gt; -- Tomei coragem e procurei o Toninho da Barcelona pelo Facebook e perguntei se ele sabia o mal que tinha causado a mim e à minha família com o depoimento mentiroso na CPI dizendo que era doleiro do PT. Chorei, quando respondeu, porque não acreditava que ele responderia. Tenho tudo registrado. Queria poder limpar o meu nome e expor as pessoas que me prejudicaram -- diz.
&gt; 
&gt; Ao falar do cerco judicial sobre os seus bens, o doleiro não parecia se preocupar:

Israelites are Jews _by definition_.   So you are saying that Jews are pretending to be Jews, which makes no sense.  And the Jews/Israelites were not 'chosen' by Yahwee, they were the inventors of Yahwee.

&gt;The people calling themselves ""jews"" actually descend from the Canaanites and Khazars.

The Canaanites were the exact same ethnic group as the Israelites/Jews.  They were the same people, differing only in religion.   So when they converted to Yahwee cultists (many of them had already worshipped Yahwee) like the Jews in Judea and Israel and started following the Old Testament they were literally indistinguishable.  In summary, the ancient Judeans and ancient Israelites were the same ethnic group as the Canaanites.

&gt;The true descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic European peoples.

England and Germany are very far from Judea and Israel.  Their entire populations walked across an entire continent en masse?  Obviously not.  There were some Israelites who went to Europe in 73AD and then returned to Israel in 1948AD.  But those Chosen People of God were treated like shit by the English, Germans, and other Europeans.  If I was Yahwee it would make be really mad that people in England, Germany, and even a few in America treated my Chosen People so badly and continue to do so.  The English and Germans were worshipping gods like Thor when the Jews/Israelites wrote the Old Testament.

Era Freestyle de rua como deve ser, e é onde os Mc's amadurecem. A Nata, no fundo. (Demora é mais tempo a maturar, mas o resultado no futuro é bem melhor)

Agora dizer que ele não se adaptou, etc... é muito redutor e questionável.

O Hip Hop portugues está o que está hoje em dia porque é quase todo ele fruto de uma geração de Mc's que nasceram e ganharam projeção na Liga Knockout uma liga de egotripping e muita palhaçada.

Tens os três da madorna que bem ou mal fazem hip hop que vem de um background bem mais sólido que a maioria dos Traps sem contudo que se houve hoje em dia.

há 8 anos como falaste, o bom Hip Hop vinha do sul de Portugal, e não de Lisboa.

Mas como Portugal o centrismo é quem dita as leis, temos agora MC's palhaços.

O NTS pode não se ter adaptado ao que o Hip Hop Português é hoje, mas isso será mau de todo? Ele sempre foi desse estilo, não vejo porque haveria de mudar.

False,AntonioOfVenice,,,,"&gt; so yes, they are/were very much a socialist idea (even tough today they are as you say 'common sense')

They may have been introduced by socialists. But the idea is not inherently socialist. Meaning, me supporting it does not make me a socialist, not that there is anything wrong with that. At least, I don't know how we are defining socialism. It's a difficult one. 

&gt; that being said during the last 100 years you see implementations of such things quite frequently. not only working hours get cut back quite frequently,

Speaking of which, I was reading through an article that asked historians and economists on what the causes were for such developments as cutting back the working hours. People may attribute them to 'activism' or whatever, but the strong consensus seems to be that it's economic growth that led to it. Of course, that does not explain differences between countries. Stronger unions may have led to a greater reduction in France (which turned out not to be so great in their case) than elsewhere, but it's pretty much guaranteed when the economy grows.

&gt;  also certain things going to the state like railways, water, postal services and electricity. (of course given the recent trend to privatize its questionable of how important they are and if they should be private or in the hands of the state, only time will tell i guess).

That is definitely socialism under any definition, by the way, since government is in possession of the means of production. I think it's best when these are private companies but strongly regulated - you don't want price-gouging, and you don't want the electrical company to shut people off like Facebook because it disagrees with their views.

&gt; though i would like for at least water to be in the hands of the state . 

How so? Is there a goal that cannot be accomplished with strong regulation? 

&gt; edit:maybe a small factoid at the side, but most those privatizations only started, after communism was 'over and proclaimed dead'; i think GB might be one of the exceptions; in fact GB might be a special case in more than one way, but i am not that well versed when it comes to english history

England was in semi-terminal decline before the 1980s, like Spain, Italy and Greece are today. Yeah, they were early to the party. But I think they privatized the ridiculously subsidized coal mining industry, rather than the core utilities that we are talking about here.

&gt; another example that at least paid out in most european countries would be 'cheaper universities'.

I do love that. In general, I do think STEM and 'useful' areas are ridiculously underfunded, because they have no strong lobbies. Science gets only a fraction of the EU subsidies that agriculture gets, because no one cares about science. Sad.

&gt; albeit arguably, since the social science got too big and doesnt bring in as much money, for the university, as they cost, you can argue for a cutback. but then again, the students work later in life and pay what they cost back in form of taxes. Except for some unnamed ,useless degrees ""cough"" ""cough"" of course. interestingly if i am allowed to use numbers from 2007 STEM fields do quite well in gaining more money than they use up, even while still studying in universities.

There is a reason China is training about, what is it a million, engineers a year. They're not spending their money on the... unnamed *useful degrees*. 

No, I agree with you completely. I am pretty sure no one is happy with the American system: I often see free market types criticize it because the loans allow universities to hike tuition as much as they want.
