GenG are very strong. They rekt T1 in qualifiers, and every one expected T1 to be the team that make it to worlds. it reminded me of worlds finals 2017. because yes, GenG is actually SSG from 2017. i place them 2nd because they have an history of wonky Bo1s. (LCK plays Bo2s during regular seasons)

EU is actually very overrated aside from G2. FNC is all over the place and fail to have a core identity. the one thing they are good at, is beating chinese team that arent called iG. 3rd

Preferring light skinned women is rooted in racism but I would call it colorism specifically. Basically it’s the idea that darker skin makes someone unattractive without even looking at the rest of their qualities (physical or character/compatibility).

Skin tone should be irrelevant when looking at eye color, hair color etc. The point is that if you won’t even give a black woman or darker skinned black woman a chance that is racist/colorist. If you say you don’t find any black women attractive even if you haven’t seen them, that’s horrible.

Having a preference for some features, for example blonde hair, is often rooted in European beauty standards which positions POC as less attractive. Having a preference for one trait isn’t always a bad thing but if you say oh I just prefer blonde hair but then see a black woman with blonde hair and would not ever give her a chance, then its problematic. Additionally a preference is one thing but saying you would never date x race, is when it is racist.

That's not up to you to decide. Clatching on to concern trolling to deny people self determination and independence. You're bellyaching about Western Armenia but you don't want to return Canada. Why not? Is Armenian culture and identity more precious than Native culture and identity?

&gt; That was over 20 actually, those are grouped together as a nation. Oh and also the Squamish. I only spoke for them as they're loc to me and I've been there. I've seen really bad situations too.

20 out of 3 continents is still pathetic. Your points show just in how much denial you are about what a catastrophe the White Man's arrival has been in the Americas and Oceania. 

&gt; I again say that based on economy and they're survivability. Not based off prejudice. I don't want it to happen, but if they want they can vote out again, they tried twice and came to almost 50/50, and less last time.

Oh yeah Quebec isn't gonna survive economically. What a joke. Just another excuse for a chauvinist.

&gt; Strawman, I already disproved that claim. How about you prove you aren't.

Disproven nothing. You employ the same exact White Man's burden language.


&gt; I'm glad that's your opinion, as I hoped it was. They deserve to be autonomous or free, and not worry for their lives; which is a point I've been consistent on.

No you haven't been at all consistent. 

&gt; That's sad &amp; rude, and I already said I'm fine if they want indendence. Whilst I prefer confederations, if they want to be self-determined they can be. I am not stopping them, nor would I if I had power.

Sad &amp; rude eh? Says the guy who was name calling in his last post. I don't care you prefer. And if they ever called for independence and suggested you move back to Europe you'd be howling instead of melancholically musing about how the it's not just that the Natives lost the Americas to the Europeans. 

&gt; The fact you keep insulting me and assuming my beliefs shows your racism and dishonesty here. Just because I am white means nothing, like how not all Turks hate Greeks.

I insult you because you are inconsistent and apply double standards and employ 19th Colonizer language. I don't insult you because you're White Canadian.

&gt; I like the fact African nations are free now, wish they were never colonised as it's caused too many tragedies. I'm glad slavery was abolished and is heavily enforced in most nations today.

Your posts sound like corporations embracing the BLM message. Empty and shallow.

&gt; What would it take for you to believe me? My beliefs are consistent and anti-oppression. I hate states in general, and see most as tyrannical. I also see people oppressed by worse states and wish they'd be free to live without free.

You're not consistent. You bellyache about Western Armenia being stolen while living in lands that were stolen. Why don't you attack your own government and people to liberate the Natives from oppression?

&gt; See Europe now for instance, nations like France, Denmark, and Germany are ideal for how too keep the peace; strong, liberal, and tolerant. They're also largely 80% homogeneous, yet still are tolerant of most minorities. See Canada, we're multi-cultural, as is our gov't. We have flaws, but we don't shoot minorities. Well except for evil and corrupt cops, but tell me one country where that isn't the case outside of western Europe and Japan.

Nations like France and Germany destroyed their multicultural identities in the centuries past and eradicated their minorities in huge historically significant events. What kind of moron holds up France as an example to follow? A nation that has willfully destroyed dozens of regional cultures within their borders and has left a bloodbath from Haiti to Vietnam to Africa. 

Minorities get shot when they rock the boat. When they have been exterminated to the point that they're without any power then they don't get shot.

1. It's morally objectionable. Unfortunately this isn't something I can argue, because it comes down to one's personal beliefs about how we should treat other people in our midst. But this type of nationalism is inherently exclusionary because it rejects the influence of outsiders or minority insiders. In practice, immigrant and ethnic minorities are denied equal opportunity at best, or are actively persecuted at worst. The strong desire to distinguish states from one another make international collaboration in solving problems more difficult.
2. It's *impractical.* We have a limited amount of desirable territory on the planet, and a finite number of practical-sized governments/countries. We are also a highly social species that travels and forms business, religious, social, etc. ties all across the planet. The idea that we can have separate countries or enclaves or governments for every social group that wants one is is not realistic, and we will never agree on how these things are allocated. Nationalism has been a driving force for war for all of recorded history. Nearly every conflict people blame on religion is essentially about nationalism.

Now, there are other types of nationalism. Some people just use the word to mean ""pride in one's country"", which is something else entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: in the context of 2020 politics, we are talking about 'white nationalism' where the nation is ""white people"" -- a group one is born into, or not -- and nationalism part is the claim that ""white people"" have a right to form a government to advance the interests of white people and control their own territory in the US and/or Europe. Most people would find that reprehensible, but strictly speaking this definition of nationalism would also include zionism (the Jewish claim on the geography and state of Israel) and the competing claim by Palestinians, the reservation system for America's native peoples, and countless other movements around the world. Nationalism is human nature and taking a hard line against it challenging because the consequences threaten people of all political persuasions.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601511539,,1601511939,0,{},g78i39j,False,t3_j2w58f,False,True,t1_g788pkj,/r/changemyview/comments/j2w58f/cmv_facebook_has_become_the_same_as_or_worse_than/g78i39j/,False,,1613727776,1,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

If you had HIV and vomiting and diarrhea, youd come in and get an IV, because dehydration on certain HIV meds could damage your kidneys. The little rooms had their own bathrooms and a wifi access point nearby so you could do work or read online. You also didn't have to be admitted to the hospital, so the come in for 3 hours, leave when you're a little better only took...3 hours. 

Other meds had side effects of liver damage. Thus, a lotta blood draws for liver damage (and kidneys as above). They had a phlebotomist nearby, so if you saw the main doc, and he wanted labs...he got blood drawn quick. No run arounds, no issues, because they wanted compliance.

&gt;non-native English is generally well accepted, provided meaning is clear.

This is where it really gets interesting. As others have mentioned, with different non-native Englishes in existence, trying to understand or establish what that clear common meaning actually is, might be very challenging in reality.

&gt;Every assessment framework I know emphasises ability to communicate and understand over grammatical accuracy.

To what extent are successful communication and comprehension contingent upon grammatical accuracy though? If some grammatical inaccuracy is tolerable in assessment, how much? Based on what standard? How does this change as learners move up competent levels? I understand that ""native speaker"" as a standard has been removed from the CEFR, for example, but I think this makes the assessment framework much more fuzzy and hard to work with in practice.

This gets back to my original question and other contributions relating to the justification for standards being used. Perhaps this is merely to do with the economic realities of most learners just needing functional English in the global marketplace. Perhaps some have grander motivations to end the ""hegemonic"" position of native-speaker English and this could be due to a post-colonial or a pan-European ideological viewpoint. There's lots going on here; it's fascinating.

Why would they? Without options like the US or the EU Serbia would likely align with whatever power they can. In the case of eastern European countries, many wind up in the fold of Russia. 

The US doesn't want countries turning to Russia or China. We prefer them coming to us, developing their countries, fighting corruption, setting standards, which in the end allows for more free trade.

The girls and boys which were beaten tried to make LGBT pride-which is unacceptable.We all know,what they are doing on this pride.
About the homophobes,it was inevitable,because of the all gay shit,that EU tried to implement.
I remind you,that the previous year БХК and the other NGOs gave students LGBT shit and ""anti-homophobia"" pamphlets.Of course,many of them were burned by the students,teachers or the principals.

Of course,aggression is not good,but when somebody tries to implement something unacceptable in the society,the citizens should repel it.

If you're claiming that China adopted eurocentric beauty standards prior to European infiltration, you're dead wrong. Their adoption of such standards is fairly recent. As Palomar College Professor Emeritus of Anthropology Dr. Dennis O'Neil [reports](https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/marriage/marriage_1.htm):

&gt;In China, round ""moon-shaped"" faces, like the one shown below on the left, have been considered exceptionally beautiful.  In contrast, angular Northern European faces, like the one on the right below, have been viewed as being undesirable.  Similarly, long-legged Europeans have often been stereotyped as being unattractively stork-like.  The Chinese also have traditionally thought that large female feet are ugly.  Prior to 1949, rich families sometimes bound the feet of their daughters tightly with cloth wrappings so as to stunt their growth.  This of course resulted in severe foot deformities that prevented them from walking normally.  However, it made it much easier for them to marry a rich man since they were now more attractive.  **Over the last two decades, mainland China has rapidly industrialized and developed modern high-rise cities.  They have also begun to emulate the life-styles of North America and Europe.  This has resulted in a change in middle class concepts of beauty**.  Taller Chinese men and women are increasingly viewed as being more attractive and successful.  Subsequently, there is a thriving business in surgery to increase leg length.  It is also becoming popular for women to use makeup and even plastic surgery to acquire more European-like faces.

I recommend that you check out my post over in r/leftyincel where I debunk the scientifically baseless myth that beauty standards are biologically determined or sociohistorically universal: [Are Beauty Standards Universal?

Yeah, no, health experts literally said banning travel at that point wasn't going to prevent the inevitable - that the disease was already in the US and **more measures** were needed to contain it. Find me one who actually said otherwise. The idea that Trump should be praised for doing the extremely bare minimum is laughable.

Meanwhile:

- He cut CDC staff working in China prior to the outbreak, epidemiologists included.

- He refused to refer to the playbook set by his predecessor, something that could have helped combat this outbreak.

- He failed to properly replace the staff on the pandemic response team. This is egregious because it resulted in a lack of co-ordination on a federal level.

- Notably, that lack of co-ordination meant that while the CDC initially botched its tests, the FDA was slow to grant state and private labs the authority to produce their own tests.

- This then delayed the deploying of mass testing, which had a domino effect on contact tracing and carrying out quarantines/isolation. For obvious reasons, that's a significant reason why containment of the outbreak failed in the US.

- He was still golfing and holding political rallies in February rather than focus on dealing with the outbreak.

- He constantly referred to it as the 'China flu', fueling racism towards Asian Americans.

- He initially downplayed the severity of the disease, causing many of his supporters to not take it seriously.

- He refuses to wear masks in public despite being in a position to encourage people to do so.

- Notably, a plan to send masks to every American in April was scrapped by him.

- He also constantly touted a drug without proven efficacy and with known severe side effects.

- Recently, he seems more interested in rushing through a vaccine before the elections for no other reason than political expediency. That poses a huge risk to public health and would absolutely bolster the anti-vaxx movement.

Yeah, go ahead and defend that.

&gt;They stupidly told everyone not to bother wearing masks in public since ""it won't keep you from catching Covid, only from spreading it yourself""

Literally never said by the CDC. There was no evidence of asymptomatic spread being that prevalent, so their advice at that point was to only wear a mask if you have symptoms so as to ensure an adequate supply for frontline workers.

Like I said, you really need to do your research.  The image of the US abroad is reflected in how much foreign aid nations accept.

Quite a few countries in Europe became upset when we spoke up about the complete failure of other member nations to kick in to the UN.  So naturally everyone started bitching.  No big deal. We pulled out of the Paris climate accords because it was a license for India and China to “catch up” with their pollution before reduction.

I have some Muslim friends but I don't feel there is a need to tell them since I didn't tell all my family members about it. My religious believes (or their absence) is something private for me.

(2) Marriage: My wife is Muslim and knows about my apostasy. We love and respect each others. My family is the most important thing in my life as for my wife.

(3) Childhood Religious Friends: they don't know.

(4) Childhood Religious Family (ex. cousins, aunts/uncles, and grandparents): Since them knowing would make a lot of problems for my wife who is still Muslim, we have agreed to not tell them.

(5) Religious Family: Only one of my brothers knows. The rest of my brothers and sisters would be shocked if they knew because I always was the practicing ""good Muslim"" in the family. But they are not religious so it would not bother them. My parents would be hurt pretty badly: they took us from europe to the middle east to teach us Islam and Arabic. There was a lot of hard times and sacrifices and they always felt that it was worth it at least as one of their children (me) ""succeeded"" to be a good Muslim and build a good Muslim family. At each birthday my mother write me a letter and in every one of them she praises god for me being a good son and a good Muslim. They would accept me if I told them but I don't want to hurt them. 

(6) Values &amp; finding someone with good values &amp; high character without needing the fear of god from religion: I'm already married so that's solved. One thing I and my wife released is that religions is way too over estimated in regard to its influence on our morals. Very few things has changed since I left religion regarding my behavior.

While I'd agree that it would be nice to have Armenia in NATO, and it would be great if Turkish-Armenian relations were better than they are, there's just no way that the two are going to suddenly start cooperating when the Turkish Government continues to vehemently deny the Armenian Genocide and Armenia effectively exists on the perpetual brink of war with Turkey and their close ally Azerbaijan.

To get more into why Armenia just isn't going to join NATO any time soon, it becomes necessary to look into NATO's purpose and goals, the immense strategic significance of Turkey, and the unfortunate reality of Armenia's geopolitical situation.

To put it simply, NATO's sole purpose is to oppose the spread of Russian (formerly Soviet) influence, namely in Europe. To this end, the NATO member states have pledged a mutual protection treaty, guaranteeing that should one come under attack, all will answer the call to arms. This has allowed the United States and her allies to form a strong united front against Russia, allowing them to dictate the terms of a potential war with Russia to be as favorable for themselves as possible. Key to this strategy is the ability to strike directly into the Russian Steppe and seize or destroy Moscow to bring about a crushing early defeat. The hope is to bring Russia to its knees before the Kremlin can fully mobilize the country. Originally, Turkey was admitted to NATO as a forward missile base from which the US could strike directly into the Soviet heartland, but since then the US has realized what a geopolitical goldmine Turkey is.

Turkey's strategic location and geographical features make it an ideal candidate for opposing Russian power in Central Eurasia. To start, the rugged interior of the Anatolian peninsula is a natural fortress, allowing Turkey to set their own rules and fight defensively should they become embroiled in a war with a foreign power, such as Russia. Secondly, Turkey exercises complete control of the Bosphorus strait, allowing them to control trade or warships coming in and out of the Black Sea (giving Turkey power over any country reliant on the Black Sea for foreign trade, for instance Russia). And finally, Turkey has also long served as the gateway between Europe and the Middle East, allowing NATO to exert influence into the Middle East through Turkey. Because of this, Turkey is perhaps the most geopolitically important member of NATO, and as the current Turkish administration continues to flex their muscles and build a network of power across the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and Eastern Europe the significance of Turkey on the global stage seems to only be on the rise.

Finally, we must look to Armenia, and to be blunt, Armenia is just irrelevant on the geopolitical stage. While Turkey is powerful enough to create its own sphere of influence outside of and within NATO, Armenia has struggled to find a place in the world since achieving its independence. From the very beginning Armenia was locked in a bloody war with Azerbaijan (itself a Turkish nation and close Turkish ally), which combined with the Turkish State's continued refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide has irreparably damaged relations between these nations. In such a state, Armenia needed friends and they needed them quick, but with nothing to offer but their land and people the world has remained largely apathetic to the Armenian struggle. The only exceptions to this have been those countries for whom opposing the spread of Turkish power is a priority, namely Russia and Iran. For the former, Turkey represents a major NATO threat and geopolitical rival in Eastern Europe and the Arab world. Meanwhile, for Iran, Turkey has historically been a sleeping bear, uninterested in the Middle East at large, but with massive potential to interfere with Iranian plans for the region. Because of this, Armenia has found itself bedfellows with two of the US' most hated rivals, making Armenia by proxy an enemy of the United States and by extension NATO, despite many people within these countries having a generally neutral or even positive opinion of Armenia.

TL:DR - Armenia is an incredibly unlikely NATO candidate, and there really isn't anything to be done at this point that can change that.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601542140,,False,0,{},g79olpm,False,t3_j20kfj,False,False,t1_g75yxkr,/r/imaginarymaps/comments/j20kfj/armeniaazerbaijan_conflict_solution/g79olpm/,False,,1613747933,2,True,False,imaginarymaps,t5_2vqof,r/imaginarymaps,public,,0,[],

&gt; Ministers would decide whether to notify the commission of any government subsidy decisions that could impact goods trade in Northern Ireland and whether to waive the need for export summary declarations when sending goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.The two sides are currently examining these issues in a joint committee but the UK government has said it needs the legislation as a &amp;quot;Safety net&amp;quot; should the EU act unreasonably.

&gt; A government spokesperson said: &amp;quot;We will respond to the letter in due course. We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to the Northern Ireland Protocol.&amp;quot;We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK&amp;#039;s internal market, ensure Ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.

&gt; The commission has also said it might bring a separate action against the UK through enforcement mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement, resulting in fines or suspension of parts of a future trade deal.

I’d especially recommend videos on comparative method and historical linguistics, like [*How do we determine what languages are related?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgzkQ8oktD4), [*Indo-European Languages: An Intro*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UQnSmEzxMI), [*How does language change*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHPZ4RBQonk), [*Reconstructing Languages*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxPnYlJ0nRE), [*Dating of Old Norse Poems*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjVqubkpTTU), and others from the [*Language History* playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLATNGYBQ-TjrI_zstt5w13eB4IFIcuX_W).

If you’re interested in historical linguistics and the comparative method you might look at [*Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction*, 2nd ed.](https://archive.org/details/ComparativeIndoEuropeanLinguistics) by Robert Beekes – this is an academic textbook with exercises in reconstruction.

If you’re interested in the Kurgan culture origins of Indo-Europeans and archaeological data supporting it, you might take a look at [*The Horse, the Wheel, and Language*](https://books.google.pl/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+horse+the+wheel+and+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCkNSZnZPsAhWDxIsKHSyvApIQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20horse%20the%20wheel%20and%20language&amp;f=false) by David Anthony – it gives a short overview of the linguistic evidence for Indo-European culture and overview of the reconstructed culture, gives rough chronology of separation of various IE branches and their migration paths, and then in the second part pretty extensively describes the archaeological evidence for supposedly early Indo-European cultures. But note this is not a linguistics book – it is rather an archaeology book about looking for cultures known only from linguistic data.

If you’re interested in comparative method in Indo-European literature, then grab Calvert Watkins’s [*How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European poetics*](https://books.google.pl/books?id=Ri4sbTiMKN4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=how+to+kill+a+dragon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6-eaGnZPsAhUklIsKHQhADSoQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20to%20kill%20a%20dragon&amp;f=false) – but beware that this book casually presents you with passages in Hittite, Old Irish, Old Norse, Sanskrit, various ancient Greek dialects, and expects you at least to be familiar with their phonology. Not an easy read.

Genocide is to have intent. The person Churchill was fighting was the one with the intent to do those things.

&gt;Following the announcement this week that the government would introduce Kent Access Permits to ensure heavy goods vehicles travelling to the port of Dover and the Folkestone Eurotunnel crossing **do not set off without the proper paperwork**, the transport industry was quick to point out Whitehall had not begun testing the technology on which they would depend.

Rather than fixing the problem, the government are trying to prevent trucks from starting their journeys at all. ""Oh it's been a great success, there are no backlog of lorries waiting to be processed"" when the reality is that they're all stuck at source rather than in Kent. I can understand this from a logistical POV to prevent the roads getting clogged up but obviously they're not prepared.

&gt;But KAPs, as they have become known, would only be issued to truck drivers who get a green or amber rating from the online Smart Freight system, which the government has yet to introduce.

&gt;The transport industry has yet to test the system and, according to reports, a beta version will not be ready until mid-December, with the release version not expected until April, well after the end of the Brexit transition period.

&gt;Sarah Laouadi, manager of European and international policy at Logistics UK, told The Register that the industry body had seen a version of the system demonstrated on a shared screen, but had not been able to explore the system itself, or understand exactly how freight companies should align processes to meet the needs of the software.

It will be a miracle if that system works without disruption. There are going to be some shipments which get delayed or cancelled as a result, further harming UK businesses.

The UK can't get what it promised in the negotiations. And the Tory leadership is ideologically incapable of accepting the power asymmetry between the UK and the EU.

They appeared on Chinese maps before hand, sure, but China also appeared on European maps, that doesn't mean Europe owned China. 

There is a good academic piece that I'll cite below that describes, much better than I can, about China's and Taiwan's relationship with the islands. To summarize, while there was not de jure international recognition of them, there was de facto recognition by neighboring countries including Japan that the islands were Chinese.

Unryu Suganuma (2000). Sovereign Rights and Territorial Space in Sino-Japanese Relations.

&gt; They were uninhabited and never developed by China, and weren't mentioned in the Treaty of Shimonoseki which transferred Formosa and the Penghu Islands after the war.

In their ""Territorial Disputes"" museum (which is quite fascinating, I'd encourage history lovers to go take a look at an alternative view of Korea, Chinese, and Russian history) the historical and past legal justification for Japanese ownership of the islands is this passage from the Treaty of Shimonoseki

""the island of Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa (Taiwan)""

The fact of them recognizing this passage even in their museum today implies that Meiji Japan recognized that they were Chinese. That in addition the the de factor recognition that Japan gave to it provides pretty strong evidence that it was in Chinese control previous to the war.

&gt;The Senkaku Islands were kept under US occupation as part of Okinawa Prefecture. If Chiang Kai-shek had regarded the islands as CHinese soil, he could easily have demanded sovereignty over them along with hte rest of Taiwan. He did not, because nobody regarded them as having ever been Chinese at this point.

I would disagree with this idea of not claiming meaning that they don't think it's Chinese. 

&gt; The idea that they were Chinese arose in the PRC and ROC after 1971, especially when the value of the sea bed around them became clear. It is a completely illegitimate claim.

I'd agree that they only started caring about the islands a lot after their value was discovered but that doesn't mean that their claims are morally illegitimate. If we're speaking legally, the situation is clear of course. I think my main motivation behind this discussion is that while I recognize Japan has a legal ownership of the islands, I think the moral background of how they took it from Taiwan is very illegitimate but I guess that's the world we live in.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601551666,,False,0,{},g79xbey,False,t3_j33cdt,False,False,t1_g79w8g3,/r/taiwan/comments/j33cdt/taiwan_foreign_ministry_protests_japan_citys_name/g79xbey/,False,,1613752057,2,True,False,taiwan,t5_2qhrg,r/taiwan,public,,0,[],

Getting through the inhabited gamespaces by altering the environment, emphasis on the environment, changing the AI puzzles, maybe changing puzzles with shared parts, if necessary or on a whim.

The Dark Mod, it's the refined mechanics, especially rope arrow physics and mantling, but not the blackjacking.

The worldbuilding and how the lore is delivered.

The sense of a vast world without ever seeing 1% of it.

Verticality without the focus being on vertigo but getting somewhere and seeing or finding things.

Sound propagation and occlusion that works.  The processing pipeline takes a hit, and graphics need to be dialed back to allow for it, so no one does it but the old games, but it's huge for that experience, and still novel.

Ambience.  Unsettling as hell.  Few strategic long lines of sight without earning them.  If I'm playing an intruder, I need to feel I do NOT belong there, and getting caught or dying is deserved (and I'm not talking gaming skills, but social boundaries).

Like Europe today, mixing several centuries of tech and architecture in one mission, but alternate universe, where steam (doesn't have to be overt steampunk), not petroleum products, and clockwork (gears as an aesthetic not necessary), drive industry.

The good and bad sides of everything (science and religion, money, secrets), with the bad being overcome by the good.  Balance.

These days, if largeness means loading zones, it's unfortunate.  Largeness that isn't delivered in obvious portions when possible is better for immersion.

Claustrophobia, especially when bypassing or hiding from AIs.

The only difference is there are so many media companies that are against Trump. So you will see more lies in favor of the left wing as a whole. 

In regards to why you guys, Europeans, see more negatively of Trump is because Trump's policy has always been America first. He has attacked the European countries on many fronts to help the US like tariffs for imported cars and asking EU countries to spend more money on defense for NATO. 

If you are American you have to admit he is right in those points. European cars are cheaper here than US cars because of the low tariff. American cars are more expensive in Europe because of the higher tariff. So Trump is just trying to make it fair or the tariff at least equal to each other. 

In regards to NATO there is a doctrine that say all countries must spend at least 2% of their GDPs for NATO to defend Europe.

So exclude yourself from the question, exclude your personal bias and you'll see a very strong ethical reason to let go of the UK and move forward on the path that's so clearly voted for election after election: kindness politics and cooperation.

That said.  I'm not mad at Trump for Covid at all.  I think he did an ok job, not great, but not nearly as bad as Biden claims.

My philosophy is that you want the states to handle most of the work, and federal is merely there for support, which is what Trump did.

Because in the time of austerity, the social safety nets that were supposed to break my family's fall failed. Not only scaled back, the people in charge purposely overlooked and misrepresented people's realities in order to mindlessly cut back the budgets. Fortunately, through hardship, we were able to raise ourselves by our bootstraps. We were lucky on that end. Yet, the trauma remains. We aren't outgoing, we don't participate in society any more than we need to because when we fell, nothing broke the fall - we certainly became more selfish in a sense.

I don't see how a society in which no one cares about anyone else can succeed. I'm a firm believer that the measure of a civilization's success is the success of its less fortunate. And I won't screw over the thousands that benefit from those safety nets to punish the handful that don't. Reminds me of the poisoned M&amp;M analogy - but in the end, these are people we're talking about, OUR people, OUR european brothers and siblings, in case being just plain old people isn't enough, not M&amp;Ms. If everyone around us is better off, our bargaining power and attractiveness as a whole society increases, potentially kick-starting a cycle of increasing prosperity and progress. If we choose to ignore the less fortunate, we'll just go down a path of increasing inequality, frustration and, in time, erosion and unrest.

I think a less esoteric discussion is not whether this is racist, but whether this is tone-deaf. And, like, on Earth in the year 2020, is having a villainous black race that enslaves white people a faux pas? Jesus, on so many levels:

* now is really not the time to be a white person writing a book about slavery

* it's mostly not the time to write a fantasy book about slavery, unless it has clear historical antecedents and the slavery is the literal subject of the book

* a fantasy book about magical enslaved white people? dude, how even

* really, are you sure you want to make ""stylistic"" race choices in the year of fucking global race riots? like, what about this experience suggests that race is ""stylistic"" to you?

* claiming that, because your dominant race is non-white, your novel doesn't have the European antecedents common in fantasy doesn't really make any sense. If I dye a turd pink, it's still a turd. It's just pink.

So you have economists even in the 1980s claming to be arguing about today's problems, but effectively skirmishing over what is the best way to reform 1890s Austria or whatever.  Who cares.  I mean that is some interesting sidelight, but not relevant to today.

Anyway, capitalism/markets are clearly two of our most powerful economic tools.  But to function ideally they rely on a lot of assumptions that are not actually true.   So you really need to end up patching them quite a bit.  There are a lot fo places where capitalism and markets need intervention.

Socialism is more about what the minimum level of subsidy you need to provide the lower classes for optimal functioning in some area or other.  Whether that be to prevent them from being wracked with disease, starving to death, committing to much crime, or rising up in anger and needing violent suppression, whatever.  Its just about finding some balance point.  And obviously people will have disagreements about where that point is, or how much crime/violence/starvation they are willing to tolerate.

So I don't even think the capitalism/markets and socialism need to be in opposition.  They are solving different problems, and can be layered on top of each other.

There absolutely is, you're just not going to achieve that by unskeptically accepting that some musicians are just intrinsically better than others without understanding why well enough to explain the metrics by which you've reached that conclusion when pressed. If anything, that's counter productive to your ability to make informed critical analysis of music.

Music has layers and complexity. Refining your taste means refining *your* taste, not just changing it to whatever the agreed upon ""elevated"" taste is. If you want to refine your own taste then you can discover and explore the facets of the music you like that drew you to it...you don't have to change those things to match the facets of music you've been told are correct to appreciate.

If you like rap music you can make an informed criticism of that...the layered structure, the horizontal harmonic movement, the rhyme cadences, the timbrel motifs, all these are relatively new models of music analysis that we only developed because contemporary theorists weren't content just to write modern music off as not being ""refined taste"" or deserving of critical analysis.

All music has depth to be explored, and telling yourself that some is not worth exploring since others are just better...because they just are this the fastest way to never really think critically or develop an informed opinion about either.

&gt;Saying that I will take the opinion of someone who has listened to 10,000 records 1 time over the person who listened to one record 10,000 times.

Well then you'd want to take the opinion of the open minded contemporary theorists I'm citing, not the closed minded classical theorists that you are. What you just described as ""listened to one record 10,000 times"" is much more apt a description of the kind of snooty classical academic who refuses to acknowledge or listen to other music. 

Of course both are still valid opinions, and the person who listens to one record a thousand times is going to have a much deeper understanding of it than someone who listened to it once. That's *why* we have so much in-depth analysis of classical period european music. What I'm saying is *not* to listen to classical theorists just because they've listened to the same music enough times to have a better critical analysis of that then we do yet of more modern music.

&gt;The proof of an artists greatness is when so many people across cultures can appreciate it that you know something cross-cultural was expressed.

All that is proof of is a history of colonialism in the culture that music originated from.

&gt;I know I'm a pretty slick player myself so I'm far from thinking that it's something unattainable. Game just recognizes game, simple as that.

Is that so? You haven't expressed any understanding of theory or musical aptitude this entire conversation and your perspective is that of someone who's so insecure about their own taste that they default to whatever they've been told ""refined taste"" is without knowing why. I'm sure you're a very capable player but you're ironically really limiting yourself by being this closed minded.

Is that why you're so against the prospect of exceptional musicians not being a thing, because you've convinced yourself you are one? Am I challenging your identity by pointing out the fact that you don't have a good reason to believe music is hierarchical? Do you feel like I'm telling you you're a loser by explaining that there is no way to ""win"" music? Just some stuff to think about...

&gt;Great players always play with other great players, and they don't care if you think they are assholes for being picky about who they play with or if they think your playing isn't up to their standards, whether they be technical or emotional.

Is that true, or do we just always give the mantle of ""great musician"" to those that become famous and bands tend to get famous together? That's just a mistaken attribution of causation combined with confirmation bias. Most bands form out of situational convenience...they just happen to know each other and vibe well. In fact, this proves *my* point that good music is based on personal taste because whenever they try to force a bunch of ""great"" musicians into one band the results are disastrous. ""Super groups"" are notoriously bad for the *exact* reason that they're based on the fallacy of artistic exceptionalism being what makes bands work instead of the reality of it being the expressive resonance and understanding between band mates.

&gt;However I'm allowed to have my favorites, and I'm allowed to defend my opinion.

I never said you couldn't. I have my favorites too. All I'm saying is that we are allowed to have different favorites for different reasons and it doesn't make either of us empirically wrong. I never said you aren't *allowed* to like Mozart, all I said is that liking Mozart isn't the ""correct"" musician to like in order to have ""refined taste"".

&gt;And music still moves me to tears all the time, so if you think I don't know anything about the spirit, you would also be wrong.

In your eagerness to be defensive you misunderstood why I brought that up. Tuck your ego for a second and listen. I'm sure plenty of music moves you...but it probably doesn't affect me the same way, just like the music that really reaches me probably wouldn't do the same for you. My point isn't that either of us are bad at understanding the spirit of music, just that the ""spirit of music"" means different things to us. Our lists of favorite songs would be completely different...and not because I know great music better than you, or the other way around, but because the things that make music, or by extension musicians, ""great"" are entirely subjective.

&gt;I can quantify the ""nothingburgers"" if I feel like going into detail.

If that's true, then do it. You can't just pretend to be too disinvested to qualify your arguments now, after however many long ass comments we've both made. Lol. That's as embarrassingly transparent.

&gt;Let's see you post some music then get back to me.

Again your ego is getting in the way of your understanding. You can search my post/comment history if you're curious about my theoretical knowledge, I assure you it exceeds the power cords and diatonic shapes in your playing. However, you're still missing the point entirely if you think I'm trying to prove that I know what makes good music better than you do. Good music, to me, is just the music that I like...just like good music for you should be what you like (and not just what you think will make people impressed with your taste).",True,False,False,,,,0,1601564897,,1601567554,0,{},g7ajkby,False,t3_j1ttu2,False,False,t1_g79049n,/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/j1ttu2/why_is_rap_treated_as_a_lesser_form_of_music/g7ajkby/,False,,1613762627,1,True,False,LetsTalkMusic,t5_2t4it,r/LetsTalkMusic,public,,0,[],

My ex's sister is married to an American. And they had 2 weddings. One in the US, on here in Europe. So the people who came from Europe to witness the ceremony  (mainly) Family and some friends were to be honest.. pretty rude. On introduction, of one of the friends literally started the conversation with, ""I can shoot a coin from x feet away."" I was like ""ok... so?"" And he barrated me that real men should atleast fire a weapon once in their life. And how he doesnt understand that Europeans cant carry weapons around. ( some countries allow concealed carry or allow gunownage on private property)
So that wasnt a great start. Anyway; they had a few days before the wedding so me and my ex were assigned to do a small tour around Antwerp. We held a small break at one of the local pubs, next to the Cathedral of Antwerp. I explain why Pater's Vaatje was famous among Antwerpians and we entered. First thing I hear one of the peope say was; This place looks like shit, why dont they renovate it. This was after I explained the building was built way back and the owners are trying to keep it as authentic as possible.
Anyway, its not what he said; its the way he said it; loud and obnoxious. After tasting a beer or 2 we proceeded. The same guy and his best buddy ( I assume) couldnt just enjoy the older buildings and their history. It was all shit, ugly, etc etc. So anyway; on the wedding itself.. more bad experiences.  
Its like, I get it, you're proud of your city ( they all were from New York or a subburb of NY) but man. We cant help the fact our cities are 100's years old and therefor some streets are small and that occasionally you'll see some wear and tear on the outside of a building thats built in the 16th century. I cant help it our Loaf of bread ""lack sugar"" (what??) And its not my fault we ordered pizza thats cooked in a stone oven (Apperantly American pizza's contain fat and European pizza's dont??)
Overal, its because of those people I kinda dislike the American attitude.

Now why in the world would Europe be dependent on the US military? 

Maybe it’s because we didn’t let (Germany) them build one after world war 2, then only let them have a small one. Then Russia controlled like a big chunk of Europe after world war 2, then Soviet Union fell apart after Cold War, so those countries that were Soviet Union didn’t have military. 

So, the result after two big “wars” Europe has very little military because of insistence by US to have limited military directly controlled by European countries (backed by offer to protect European counties with its big US military) AND the collapse of the Soviet military in previously Soviet controlled countries. Which the US moved into and were like, hey we’ll help. 

We could have moved out of Europe right after world war 2 and just gave tons of money to Europe to rebuild a giant grand military, and then Cold War just given even more money to European allies to build even bigger militaries to “fight” back against the USSR. (While we built up here’s in American soil). 

But we wouldn’t “control” any of that. So, we kept doing the same thing we did after world war 2, which is offer to Europe in exchange for “control” over the military of Europe we will provide a lot of the military in the area. 

The concept of having large currently control of NATO, or the general region is to prevent: “Nazis” or essentially any military that represents interests against the US. 

Which is essentially a continuation of our initial no military, we’re your military concept in Germany after world war 2.

Nature and nurture.  Every human has tribalistic and xenophobic tendencies.  Those tendencies tend to vary based on various genetic factors, but we all have them to a greater or lesser extent.

That's the nature side of the equation.  For most of us, the nurture side mitigates those tendencies.  We learn to be more civilized and more tolerant than our primate ancestors.  For a few, their home environments amplify rather than mitigate bigotries.

Religion tends to be an amplifier.  It's no coincidence that the religious right in the USA is also aligned with racist and anti-LGBT movements.  Just look at the [list of intolerant sections in the Christian Bible](https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/int/long.html).  While much intolerance in Christianity focuses on non-Christians, it's not hard to see how it can be interpreted as a rejection of ""other"", essentially amplifying tribalistic tendencies towards xenophobia.

Atheists, by never adopting or explicitly rejecting religion, tend not to have those attributes.

&gt; Lets say for example eugenics, im almost 100% sure many religious people will not even know what that is, while many atheist outside of reddit often like it.

I'll be honest, I've never met a person in real life that would cop to being pro-eugenics.  I've met a few on reddit, but even then it seems rare.  I happen to know a large number of atheists.

So when you say many atheists outside of reddit often like it, I doubt you.

Also, historically, most genocide has been along racial/ethnic lines, very frequently between enthnic religious groups and very frequently sectarian.  This isn't to say that religion is a motivating factor here, but the xenophobia inherent in most organized religion probably does not hurt.  Even in modern day, very few genocides are atheists killing the religious (China excepted).

&gt; And even worse, atheist in america, with atheists overall. In germany for example you could ask racist people if they are atheist, and a huge portion of them would say yes. Also the Pagan/Atheist Neo nazi scene is extremly big in europe.

Try that question in Poland when asking about homosexuals.  Or Turkey asking about Christians.  Europe is a mix of countries with different biases.

*The glans penis (head) is not a sexual erogenous zone. It only has pain, pressure and temperature nerves. It does not contain fine touch tactile nerve. The foreskin, frenulum and ridged band like the ciltoris and labia do contain fine touch receptors.*



*Male circumcision is extremely severe removing the 3 most sensitive parts of the penis and 1/2 of penile tissue. It is linked to frequently orgasm difficulties in men and pain and discomfort in their female partners l.  It can also causes the meatus to shrink  which at worst can making urination difficult and painful and at minimum cause weak urine stream and longer time to empty the bladder.*



*The foreskin, frenulum, and ridged band are the 3 most sensitive parts of the penis and all contains fine touch receptors such as Meissner's corpuscles, Epidermal Merkel nerve endings and Pacinian corpuscles. The glans penis does not and it's not a primary erogenous zone. It's made to sense the foreskin gliding across it but that's it.*






*The foreskin provides gliding action reducing friction and the need for lubrication. It's also provide plesure to not only the man and but also his partner.*




[The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis.The most sensitive location on the circumcised penis is the circumcision scar on the ventral surface. Five locations on the uncircumcised penis that are routinely removed at circumcision were more sensitive than the most sensitive location on the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x) 




[The glans penis is primarily innervated by free nerve endings and has primarily protopathic sensitivity. Protopathic sensitivity refers to cruder, poorly localized feelings (including pain, some temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical contact). In the glans penis, encapsulated end-organs are sparse, and found mainly along the glans corona and the frenulum. The only portion of the body with less fine-touch discrimination than the glans penis is the heel of the foot. In contrast, the male prepuce ridged band at the mucocutaneous junction has a high concentration of encapsulated receptors. The innervation difference between the protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the prepuce is part of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue. In females, the glans clitoris and the inner plate of the prepuce have corpuscular receptors on their oppositional surfaces. Merkel cells mediate tactile sensations, and are found in glabrous skin ; they have been reported in the clitoris and can be identified in the male prepuce.](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/)

and other types of mechanoreceptors typically found in primate glabrous skin (lip or digit) are not present in the glans penis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3697758/)



[The mean length of prepuce in this sample was 6.4 cm (range 4.8-9.2) and covered 93% of the mean penile shaft (6.9 cm). Ten prepuces were as long as or longer than the shaft of the penis to which they belonged; three of them were &gt; 10% longer than the shaft and glans combined. 51% of the length of the mean adult penile shaft, or more from nearly half the penises. CONCLUSION: CIRCUMCISION REMOVES MORE THAN HALF OF TOTAL PENILE SKIN](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/) 



[In conclusion, circumcision removes the most sensitive parts of the penis and decreases the fine‐touch pressure sensitivity of glans penis. The most sensitive regions in the uncircumcised penis are those parts ablated by circumcision. When compared to the most sensitive area of the circumcised penis, several locations on the uncircumcised penis (the rim of the preputial orifice, dorsal and ventral, the frenulum near the ridged band, and the frenulum at the muco‐cutaneous junction) that are missing from the circumcised penis were significantly more sensitive.](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x)




[Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in their female partners, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21672947/) 



[During intercourse the loose skin of the intact penis slides up and down the shaft of the penis, stimulating the glans and the sensitive erogenous receptors of the foreskin itself. On the outstroke the glans is partially or completely engulfed by the foreskin. This is known as the `gliding mechanism.'
The gliding mechanism is Nature's intended mechanism of intercourse. As such, it contributes greatly to sexual pleasure. Also, since more of the loose skin of the penis remains inside the vagina, the woman's natural lubrication is not drawn out to evaporate to a great extent, which makes sex easier without using artificial lubricants.The prepuce is a highly innervated and vascularized genital structure. It is entirely lined with the peripenic muscle sheet. Specialized ecoptic sebaceous glans on the inner preputial surface produce natural emollients and lubricants necessary for normal sexual function. The primary orgasmic triggers are found in the preputial orifice and frenulum. When unfolded, the prepuce is large enough to cover the length and circumference of the erect penis and acts as a natural sheath through which the shaft glides during coitus. Only the presence and functions of the prepuce allow for physiologically normal coitus to occur as designed by nature.](http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/)



[The analysis sample consisted of 1059 uncircumcised and 310 circumcised men.
For the glans penis, circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis).For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations.In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-41)

[],,ActualStreet,1538393280.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2bo87fra,False,False,[],"The number of patients leaving Britain and flying overseas for medical treatment has trebled as NHS waiting times reach a record high, a Telegraph investigation has revealed.

Government data shows the number of people going abroad for healthcare has increased from 48,000 in 2014 to almost 144,000 last year as the health service struggles to cope with demand.

Experts said lengthening waiting times for surgery - particularly hip, knee and cataract operations - and cutbacks to fertility treatment - were fuelling the rise.

NHS waiting times are now the longest they have been for almost a decade, with more than 409,000 people waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment - a rise from 34,000 in 2014.

Patient groups said the figures reflected badly on the NHS.

Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said: “It is a desperately sad state of affairs that people who have paid into the NHS all their lives are finding it is not there for them when they need it.

“These are essential operations, but thousands of people are being left in pain and misery - for every person who goes abroad there will be many more left suffering,” she said.

It comes amid a crackdown on “health tourism” within the UK. From Monday, hospital staff will be told to routinely ask patients for utility bills and bank statements in a bid to identify those from overseas who should be paying for NHS treatment.

The new figures from the Office for National Statistics show a 198 per cent per cent rise in trips abroad from the UK for medical reasons between 2014 and 2016.

Such treatments include dentistry and cosmetic surgery, which are offered more cheaply in many Eastern European countries. But health experts said the sharp rise reflected growing numbers of British patients going abroad for medical operations, amid lengthening waits and creeping rationing.

One medical travel website, Medigo, reported a 200 per cent rise in queries about orthopaedic treatment in one year, with rising numbers going to countries such as France and Switzerland for hip and knee operations.

Ugur Samut, it’s chief executive officer, said: “What we are finding is increasing numbers of patients from the UK wanting to avoid the waiting times on the NHS. We are especially finding that in orthopaedics, that is one of the biggest areas.”

Other countries seeing an influx include those which heavily market fertility services, with a ten-fold rise in patients flying from the UK to Spain.

A seven-fold rise was seen in medical journeys to Greece, another major area for IVF, with a doubling in travel to Hungary, where dentistry, fertility services and cosmetic surgery are popular.

Countries such as Switzerland and France, both popular for orthopaedic surgery, saw a six-fold rise and a 60 per cent rise respectively, between 2015 and 2016, the figures show.

Some of the most popular destinations, such as Poland and Romania, might also be explained by increased migration to Britain, with some returning to their native country for medical procedures.

The ONS statistics show 143,996 flights from the UK for medical reasons in 2016, compared with 100,338 in 2015 and 48,190 in 2014.

Under EU reciprocal arrangments, British citizens are entitled to have treatment elsewhere in Europe, with costs covered by the health service, if it is treatment the NHS normally funds.

Mr Samut said around 60 per cent of those seeking treatment abroad were aware of such rights.

Why is the NHS under so much pressure?
Professor Philip Schoettle, professor of orthopedic surgery at the Knee &amp; Hip Institute Munich, said: “We are seeing a lot of patients from the UK. A lot of the time it is people working in finance, whose insurance is international and they don’t want to spend all that time on a waiting list.”

“Germany has very low treatment costs - they can come here and spend their time lying in a luxury suite, with an a la carte menu and physiotherapy twice a day - they are getting first-class treatment and also getting pampered,” he said.

Scarlett McNally, from the Royal College of Surgeons said: “With over 400,000 NHS patients waiting longer than 18 weeks for planned treatment, and an increasing number of clinical commissioning groups restricting access to surgery for certain groups of patients, it is not surprising that some people will look elsewhere for healthcare.

“It is hard to say whether current strains on the NHS explain the rise in patients travelling abroad for surgery.  We are aware, however, that more patients are using private healthcare, at least in part because of longer waiting times.”

Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said he was “extremely worried” about the impact of rationing restrictions on couples trying to start a family. NHS access to fertility treatment is now the worst it has been since 2004, with just 12 per cent of areas providing three cycles of IVF.

“There is no doubt that rising numbers are going abroad for fertility treatment - we have seen a steep decline in access to IVF,” said Prof Balen.

A Department of Health spokesman said: “The NHS has recently been independently judged the best healthcare system in the world and is providing safer care to more people than ever before – last year 11.6 million operations were carried out on the NHS, 1.9million more than in 2010. 

“There are many reasons why people seek treatment abroad, and the total number who did last year is less than 1 per cent of those who began treatment in the UK.”

- Wetlands/forest 1 are buffed and that's pretty significant. the post actions are nice
- Wetlands/forest 2 buffed with an extra resource and pre actions, huge buff. most impactful change here imo. this is gonna lead to stronger starts which seems like a good thing on its own at least. 
- Wetlands/forest 3 &amp; 4 (especially 4) feel underwhelming. The next actual resource coming at 5 seems far away. Kind of wish 4 was still just extra resource and 5 was post action. 
- Every grasslands column nerfed compared to original boards which is a good change overall. Because eggs start lower though it increase sthe value of the higher egg columns.
- Grasslands 3/4 feel like a more rewarding track than wetlands/forest with the additional post action. 
- Wetlands preaction has pretty good utility i think, trade a food for better cards.
- The forest preaction though? Trade a food for a re-roll... you mean rather than just using that food combined with one of the foods in my original roll to get what I want? Seems like very little utility unless you need TWO+ specific resources and even then its still risky. This seems pretty poorly thought out to me. Forest 4 is extremely weak, and forest was already the weakest area IMO. Better be some good Forest birds coming. 

All that to say, it's a little concerning to me because I think a pretty optimal play is getting wetlands/forest to 2 and then going for grass. Grass got nerfed at the start and seems like that track has more to gain. Food/wetlands are buffed to be very serviceable at 1/2. 

Everyone here is saying they hope this stops egg spamming (Which I personally have zero problems with after European) - eggs did get slightly nerfed here but grasslands as a track got MORE rewarding in my eyes due to starting weaker and gaining more than the other tracks.

I call myself Mexican and American. 

While I get that sometimes for whatever reasons you may want to speak about origins, it just feels odd to me. Moreover, 2/3s of Mexico's territories lie now in the U.S. and large swaths of inhabitants in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and California at the least were originally Mexican to whom the border crossed them. Cities in the Valle de Texas, San Antonio, El Paso, Corpus Christi, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Las Cruces, Tucson, etc. have original folks from way back when. 

As to Mexico, you'll find the odd guy saying he's Spanish and Mexican of which there are many, but really you're just Mexican.

Things that happen in Dec.

1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. 
2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.

Quarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. 

Rest is storytime:

If this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.
Sell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. 

So how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the ""new management"" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. 

So the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:

https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98

Okay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.

Fantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.

But there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.

Now we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone.

I'm not sure what you're on about but you seem to have a problem with some specific UK government policy. I don't generally pay attention to the UK government. As I see it, their activity almost always boils down to a balancing act between maximising exploitation for the benefit of the rich on the one hand and minimising loss of votes from the poor on the other. Yet another policy that exploits the poor is not something I'm going to get excited about.

2 - The housing is part of that motivation system. As I said, this system would work to guarantee people don't crash and burn. It isn't just given. It's just a pick me up.

3 - Charities have a very limited scope. Social programs are much more robust ways to help people. Does that mean that charities have no place in society? No. Just that we should approach problems in a ""Those who want to do more"" fashion, rather than ""Those who want to do"". Also, it's easy for the more wealthy folk to abuse fiscal systems through charities, since they get fiscal benefits that in the end ends benefiting their own wealth, while allocating less funds in total through taxation and donation.

5 - Housing guarantee comes from a diverse set of policies with the objective of increasing access and affordability for the less fortunate. It doesn't mean everyone will have a quaint two story home on a nice suburb. It means that depending on your financial capabilities, you'll receive more or less support to keep your home, or, in the worst case, that you'll have a little place to stay temporarily while you get your act together, with support from social counseling and orientation.

6 - The only thing big multinational companies tell me about economies and their competitiveness is how weak the antitrust laws are. In our internal market we should foment internal cooperation to face the international competition if needed. Look at Airbus. If it's too easy to conglomerate and eat up the competition we ironically end up in an uncompetitive economy ruled by monopolies. Now THAT will hurt everyone. In sum, I support my local businesses, thank you very much, and if we need something bigger, a better strategy is to make it easy for our companies to dialogue and rise to face the foreigners. And can we afford to be more social? I spoke of the Nordics earlier. Not too shabby of a system. I think the rest of us can do something in the way of getting a bit more social, not necessarily to their level. So yea, we can afford it. Especially if we equate the benefits of the social policies on the productivity and health and well being of the population. Just because Europe is practically the gold standard comparing to the rest of the world, doesn't mean we can do better, more efficiently and more fairly.

7 - And once again you indulge a falacy. People in my country are free, but unlike Americans generally believe freedom to be, our freedom ends when the next person's begins. So are we really all free? Kinda. And those that overexert their freedom? They get their freedom taken away.

I guarantee that in this country, there will be a roof for you in case push comes to shove -&gt; overexert that right and screw over the people who contributed to that policy for your benefit, overexert your freedom, and some of that freedom will be taken away. Punishing mustn't be preemptive, must come after the transgression. And by looking coldly at economic indicators and disregarding the possibilities that occur in society, you are punishing people without them necessarily doing a bad thing. 

This may all look like scary socialist words, but I don't think it's that at all. I'm not a socialist, in any way, I don't need to study economics or political science to understand how harmful decisions made by centralized power made in a complete bubble can be...

I’m using Duolingo to learn Brazilian Portuguese. I’ll try Memrise in the future, when I have space on my phone for the app. I’ll need to look for YouTube videos to help. I found one of my Sister’s old phrase books too - I’ll note down main phrases to try to remember. 

Learning a little bit, but every day is helping me to stay motivated and remember what I’ve learnt.

After I’m comfortable with the basics, I’ll get a tutor and find Brazilian people who I can practice speaking with. Already knowing French has helped to make learning Brazilian Portuguese easier. 

I’ll surprise my Sister and my BIL with my knowledge next year, when his family visit. I hope people are able to understand when I speak it. It’s quite hard to get it right - words aren’t always pronounced by how they are spelt. There are quite a few different accents used with letters, way more than there is with French. 

Also, my BIL said that Brazilian Portuguese isn’t similar to European Portuguese, it’s a lot different. What do you think? My Sister knows European Spanish and South American Spanish, she said European Spanish just has a lisp, that’s the main difference - is that similar for Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese too?

Malaysia has nice empty beaches on the East coast to the North, and boat trips.

Indonesia is fine in the larger cities and has good healthcare, but again I'd avoid any

Europe can be interesting if you can get a car and want to use campsites in the good weather.

areas.

My family paid $8000 for the birth of each of our children. A single trip to the emergency room cost me nearly $2000. The hospital will not negotiate with people who have insurance, and they barely even offer payment plans anymore. The only negotiation I was ever offered for those bills was the opportunity to pay $1000 per month rather than the full amount all at once. I was allowed to pay over time with zero interest. That’s it.

Our family is upper middle class so we were able to absorb the financial hit, but it destroyed our savings. We have paid tens of thousands of dollars in the last few years just for medical care alone, and we are insured. We pay just as much in taxes as any European or Canadian, but have very little to show for it.

And in response to anyone who says that these bills are reasonable and affordable with a little bit of lifestyle adjustment, allow me to provide some perspective. I could spend $5 at Starbucks every single day for a year, and it STILL would not be as much as my emergency room bill for 6 hours of treatment. 

This person also has no clue what they’re talking about with the assistance available to lower middle class and poor people. Disability programs are very hard to qualify for and vary by state. Free clinics are usually overcrowded and provide substandard care. Hospitals are obligated to treat everyone that walks through the doors, but that obligation only covers emergency lifesaving care. Once you’re stabilized and not in imminent danger of dying, they’re allowed to kick you out without providing any follow up.

Except the reports don't say 7% are ""riots"".

[Here's a Twitter thread from an employee of the ACLED providing additional context, including the fact the 7% that's violent includes right-wing agitators and police officers.](https://twitter.com/sekhburd/status/1309157561149665281?s=21)


And here's the full Twitter thread formatted for easier reading since people like to pretend they can't read Tweet threads.


&gt;So I don't talk about my job very often, for a variety of reasons. However, one thing I do is track crisis data in certain parts of the world. This year ACLED (Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data) has been putting out data on the USA and our Protests.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So quick background, ACLED tracks ""crisis"" events around the world, but usually not Europe or the USA. They track stuff like Protests, Riots, Battles, Political Violence, etc. This year they are tracking the USA from 24 May - Now due to the BLM Protests.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So from 24 May - 19 Sept, there have been 12,662 separate incidents. 12,607 are classified as Demonstrations, and 55 as ""Political Violence"". The difference between the two is Political Violence is individuals that congregate for the express purpose of violence vs protesting.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So of these incidents, 67.58% are considered BLM affiliated, and 34.42% are ""Other"", including specific police brutality but not BLM related protests, or protests of non-Black police related deaths (eg: protesting latino, native, asian individuals etc deaths).

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***So here's the big one. 93.35% of ALL Demonstrations associated with BLM are Non-Violent. That means /NO/ vandalism, looting, etc. Only 6.65% are considered ""Riots"", eg Looting, and violence. 6.65%! That's around 500 individual incidents. That might seem like a lot but the final bit of data is WHO is perpetrating these 500 individual incidents, so lets look at that data. Of this data, only 21 incidents are classified as ""Mob Violence"", eg Protesters attacking individuals directly for whatever reason (ACLED does not attribute blame) ***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So the incident of the man firing a bow into protesters would still be ""Mob Violence"". 28 Incidents are ""Violence against civilians"", eg George Floyd's death would be considered this. Non protest related police brutality. 28 incidents in 4.5 months.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***Then ACLED classifies 69 incidents as ""Excessive Force against protesters"", these are almost all Vehicular incidents, police or otherwise. That's 69 protests where someone attempted to drive over a protester or something similar.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Finally we have 623 ""Violent Demonstrations"". This is both BLM and non BLM related demonstrations in the US this year, accounting for that about ***6% of incidents***. It's important to note ACLED does not attribute blame, so we statistically cannot tell from the data who started any of the conflicts here, but the word ""Gas"" and ""Pepper"" appear in hundreds of entries, so you'll have to draw your own conclusion. ***Three interesting notes, one is that ""Antifa"" only appears 10 times. Out of all those incidents.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Another is that certain specific, civil war accelerationist right wing groups who I won't name so I don't get fucking brigaded show up twice, of which one ACLED classified as ""working with US Police"", so even groups like ACLED see whats going on with these orgs. Finally, ACLED has started classifying the US Police as ""Police Forces of the United States (2017 - ?)."" I would assume they are classified this way to distinguish the new ""off the leash"" Police that Trump is supporting vs previous more subtle US administrations.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The last place I saw them do this type of classification was in an African nation that had undergone a Coup so that they could categorize Pre and Post coup crisis data. That's how fucked up this data is. Anyways. This is a long chain so I just wanted to provide some actual info to people. 600 violent incidents might seem like a lot, but that runs the gamut of ""1 individual"" incidents eg: George Floyd and mass Riots eg: Portland vs. Feds. ***and thats out of 12000+ Incidents.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The bottom line. Protesting in the USA is by a VAST majority peaceful, Antifa is not a mass organized group causing a ""War"" in the USA, ***and the US policing has gotten so bad that we now warrant a CRISIS page on ACLED due to the potential political violence in 2020.*** Use this info as you will.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***For those wondering who ACLED is or why do we care? ACLED is what the US Government uses to justify lots of our policy decisions in foreign places like Africa and the Middle East.

At the time the US was first colonized, our colonial overlords were transitioning from a late feudal society into absolute monarchy. Regional cultures and languages were being assimilated into a new national identity. See for example France and its language policy that erased the other Romance languages of France.

This tend continued during the colonial era up until roughly the modern era. Power became quite centralized in Europe at the national level. Sub-national entities have few powers, possibly not even the ability to tax, meaning it's impossible to have a huge number of local regulations to comply with.

The handful of republics like Switzerland and the US definitely saw centralization as well, but it seems like we maintained local authority. I suspect this is a result of both nations (roughly) coming together as a union of states.

This meant that when the EU and forerunners were getting started, treaties to set a maximum number of VAT rates in each country definitely had to deal with a plethora of special interests, but not too many random local authorities worried they'd lose out on tax revenue.

This made it easier to reduce the number of rates, as they knew the US was a clusterfuck of tax rates and rules, and their goal was to make international commerce pretty straightforward.

The US Constitution likely doesn't allow a national sales tax, making it harder for a similar effort to clean up tax rules, at least at a Federal level.

There's a trade-off here: 

Do you want local authorities to be able to adapt to local situations / experiment (possibly corruptly) at the cost of more variation (and thus a higher cost to comply with rules)?

Or should the central state reduce the number of differences to streamline compliance, at the cost of potentially imposing rules that make little sense in a local context or force bad rules on everyone?",True,False,False,,,,0,1601574743,,False,0,{},g7b63tj,False,t3_j2intr,False,True,t1_g789v53,/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/j2intr/are_labourvoting_areas_getting_preferentially_hit/g7b63tj/,False,,1613773339,2,True,False,LockdownSkepticism,t5_2iokxd,r/LockdownSkepticism,public,,0,[],

There's still a lot that hasn't been properly explored with OSM tagging for mapping marketplace stalls, market pitches and other informal sales sites. Outside of Europe &amp; North America these are often a significant component of the retail mix, but there are plenty of examples across the former two continents too.

Some examples of open-air markets, trying to show different possibilities:

*  [Cambridge Market](https://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=52.20570&amp;lon=0.11858) has been mapped with the loose fabric covers over the market stalls mapped as building=roof. Most of the stalls are permanent: not an insignificant number of regular UK mappers will remember Andy's Records on the market.
* [Wochenmarkt Helevtiaplatz](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2463960533) is twice weekly, with most stall holders having permanently allocated pitches as can be seen on the official plan. Outside of the opening hours the stalls are dismantled &amp; the square is available for other uses.
* [Flower stalls Ryne](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.06158/19.93881)k, Krakow. There are several stalls (mapped) which trade until early afternoon. I think they remove their stalls afterwards. To my certain knowledge stalls have been here since the early 1930s.
* [Mercado Orienta](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/437601370#map=17/12.14786/-86.25968)l, Managua. I cant remember who told me about this, but this place is absolutely huge with perhaps 35k retail outlets. An amazing challenge for mappers.
* Accra. Several marketplaces have been mapped in Accra, and often there is a Mapillary [trace](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2463960533) to provide an idea of what they look like.
* Ladies Night Market, Kowloon, Hong Kong (roughly in [this are](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/102422597#map=16/22.3178/114.1696)a).

We can't do this because it'd require us to societally admit that it is a true statement that the right wing disinformation apparatus wildly outscales the left because the right wing, at this juncture in history, is almost entirely driven by regressive, reactionary lack of policy.

Hell, just *the mere fact that you felt obligated to mention eliminating left wing disinformation* is part of that. Does it exist? Oh sure yeah.

It's not that we wouldn't have the world without the abolition of slavery, it's the other way around. We live in a world that is the *direct result* of slavery. The Industrial Revolution was already well under way by the time the United States was ramping up to the Civil War. The success of the Industrial Revolution was in large part driven by the rise of the consumer class; a group of people that can only exist if they can afford to buy things with their wages. The widespread availability to cheaply produced goods was possible in part because of changes in manufacturing processes that allowed larger numbers of uniform goods to made rapidly and in good condition, but in a larger sense the reason those goods were able to be produced so cheaply has to do with the costs of labor and of the raw materials. The number one driver of industry across the world, not just in the United States, was cotton. Thanks to a large slave population and a favorable climate the United States rapidly became the world's leading supplier of cotton. If you bought a cotton shirt in England or Germany, the cotton used to make that shirt was almost certainly cultivated, harvested, and cleaned by slave labor. The economic activity generated by cotton cultivation touched almost every area of industry and finance. Enslaved people generated billions in capital that was used in part to construct the metropolises of northern cities like Chicago and New York. As important shipping and transit hubs companies in cities like these benefited tremendously in documented material ways. 

Now granted without the abolition of slavery we would not be living in exactly the same world; it should go without saying that slavery's abolition is a significant turning point American and world history. However, the idea that Industrialization and slavery are incompatible is a false one. If the kings of industry had been allowed to use slave labor to operate their factories they would have most assuredly done so. The general attitude of management towards labor during this time was one of grudging cooperation at best and open hostility at worst. Let us not forget that factory owners would often prefer to hire women and children to man their machines for the simple fact that they could get away with paying them criminally small wages, nor should we forget the existence of company towns in which the entire economy was controlled by a corporate interest. The only thing stopping an Industrial Slave Revolution were the laws of Northern States, and the Civil War itself. 

When the Southern States seceded from the Union, their hope was not simply to maintain their slave holdings and continue their way of life. Many in the Confederacy envisioned a vast slave empire that stretched from the Southern United States and across Mexico and Central America. This expansion would have been fueled by the adoption of Northern industrial practices and technology to greatly increase the amount of cotton that could be cultivated and processed. Remember that it was not until the invention of the Cotton Gin, and its subsequent refinement and perfection, that American Slavery reached the apex of its economic productivity. 

All of this is to say merely that the modern world, if we take modern world to mean one of technology and convenience, does not exist in spite of slavery, but rather because of it. Even today large portions of the world economy are driven by virtual slave labor. Much of the cotton used in textile mills around the world is produced by criminally underpaid workers, and is assembled by similarly underpaid workers, the workplaces of which are virtual carbon copies of American and European sweatshops that characterized the early industrial age. The rare-earth minerals that made advanced computers and the information age possible are extracted from places in Africa and South America that often have virtually no actual protections for their workers. We tend to think of slavery as a relic of the past because it is no longer directly visible to us, but it is still a pernicious problem in many places all over the world.

&gt;Once we recognize super-spreading as a key lever, countries that look as if they were too relaxed in some aspects appear very different, and our usual polarized debates about the pandemic are scrambled, too. Take Sweden, an alleged example of the great success or the terrible failure of herd immunity without lockdowns, depending on whom you ask. **In reality, although Sweden joins many other countries in failing to protect elderly populations in congregate-living facilities, its measures that target super-spreading have been stricter than many other European countries. Although it did not have a complete lockdown, as Kucharski pointed out to me, Sweden imposed a 50-person limit on indoor gatherings in March, and did not remove the cap even as many other European countries eased such restrictions after beating back the first wave.** (Many are once again restricting gathering sizes after seeing a resurgence.) Plus, the country has a small household size and fewer multigenerational households compared with most of Europe, which further limits transmission and cluster possibilities. It kept schools fully open without distancing or masks, but only for children under 16, who are unlikely to be super-spreaders of this disease. Both transmission and illness risks go up with age, and Sweden went all online for higher-risk high-school and university students—the opposite of what we did in the United States. It also encouraged social-distancing, and closed down indoor places that failed to observe the rules. **From an overdispersion and super-spreading point of view, Sweden would not necessarily be classified as among the most lax countries, but nor is it the most strict. It simply doesn’t deserve this oversize place in our debates assessing different strategies.**

The *actual* TL;DR is that the overlooked variable of *k*, which roughly equates to dispersion, could be used to inform policy decisions intended to keep us safe.

You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.


President Donald J. Trump: (50:32)
I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management.

lack of management? so trump basically shot himself in the foot because he is the one supposedly managing these wildfires.

Couple this with conditions of extreme strife (revolution, genocidal war, civil war, total international hostility, incessant foreign attempts to undermine the government, the constant threat of apocalyptic conflict, and on and on and on), under which *any* and *every* society would become harsher, more violent, and less willing and able to take risks in the form of leniency towards perceived threats, and the existence of at times brutal state repression is entirely predictable and unsurprising. It has no specific connection to the political colour of the movement, the government, etc. Look at the extremely brutal, violent repression in France during the Reign of Terror, or prior to that the utter blood-drenched character of the English Revolution: the bourgeoisie did exactly as the proletariat has, if anything they did worse.

This has to be one of my biggest/longest projects, just putting the skeleton down took me a while. After I asked what peoples favourite Ace race theme was, city won out, so that was the theme.

Inspiration/References:

Spider-Man PS4 and Trilogy (Toby Maguire FTW)

Objective:

Create a map with good flow and design 

Allow new players to navigate and perform well

Provide shortcuts for later games or risk takers

Have fun with visual gags and Easter eggs

Allow multiple paths that reward difficult areas and punish failures(not by much), this creates diversity and flow. I have seen MULTIPLE players get stuck on a section eventually going from 15th-20th to 50th to 40th, this should not happen. If there were options for example, a longer-ish water section at the flower jump pads, players have the option to take it in order to continue with the game unhindered.

————-

Yellow wool: Speed boost

Blue wool: Elytra 

Red square: Jump Pad

Orange wool: Mega Jump Pad

———

&amp;#x200B;

1. First players leap off a cloud, representing the old Ace Race map, from there they proceed to do a cloud dropper into the water.
2. From here, participants riptide swim through some speed boosts underwater onto a platform. From this platform they can see that they are in an intertwining canal, where they must navigate through different canals, even jumping from one to another, over houses, like dolphins in order to reach the next section. Some sections of the canal will have speed boosts, some won’t.
3. From here contestants will exit the canal onto an open street, displayed in the picture, and descend into the sewers. They may also see more of the map in the distance.
4. So far the contestants have been split, but now they will be scattered. In the sewer, the path splits into 2. Right and Left.
5. (Right Path) contestants exit the sewer at the base of a large clock tower needing to climb it with an upwards mega jump combined with elytra’s.
6. Reaching the top they must jump out of the clock face, no elytra, and proceed to run across subsequent buildings, sometimes jumping through them revealing small Easter eggs within, if a player were to fall they do not restart, they can continue by running in the ground section through the ground floor of buildings until they reach a bounce pad that may take them up to a building where they can continue jumping.
7. Players on buildings will then slowly converge with players who took the LEFT PATH 
8. (Left Path) Individuals who decided to take this path will exit the sewer onto the street and must run through it in order to progress, speed boosts as scattered on the ground, jump pads are on top of cars. It is also possible to see the players who took the right path by looking right and up.
9. Using the jump pad will take a bit more time but it is a safer bet, whereas using speed boosts will run the risk of bumping into cars or crashing into old lady’s. Slowly both sections converge into one another.
10. After both paths converge they will see the entrance to an underground subway ahead they must descend down.
11. Sections of the tunnel will be broken/cracked forcing players to jump across with bounce or fly with elytra.
12. (Super easy place to put Easter eggs ex: dinosaur frozen in ice)
13. When section is over, a large building can be seen in the distance. Multiple sections of their building contain jump pads, mega jumps and water, disguised as glass. Participants can use ANY path they choose to climb to the top.
14. Observant players can trident THROUGH some sections of “glass” into the building and scale it with speed pads and jump boosts 
15. Finally at the top helicopter pad players will mega jump elytra to different mega jump elytra’s until reaching the cloud and land where 1 lap will be counted. Skilled players can skip the platform and elytra dive-bomb into the dropper saving time but taking massive risks. 
16. (Every mega jump elytra is a checkpoint, I’m a mad man but I’m not evil, BTW watch out for birds mid flight.)
17. Large arrows are around the map making it IMPOSSIBLE to go wrong, like seriously the giant green and red arrow in the sky/buildings

The catch all explanation of mental illness does go some of the way toward creating a rationale for these events but all too often the perpetrators either keep their motivations secret or commit suicide possibly as a final FU to the world.  

Hotels in general and Las Vegas hotels in particular are known for their discretion.  We have evidence of how all of the guns were brought up as he was seen on video with many suitcases making multiple trips to his room.  It may seem obvious in hind sight but seeing someone take luggage upstairs in a busy hotel is almost the most normal thing in the world and even if the multiple different employees working different shifts were to put it together that he was taking a lot of luggage it's not really their business to examine bags or interrogate customers about this kind of thing.  Casino/hotels can turn an blind eye to drug dealing and prostitution happening on their premises because they're not in the business of fighting crime, they're in the money making business and making the guests happy and comfortable is a big part of that business.

Why didn't he use all of his ammunition?  Again this is a question only the shooter could answer but we can look at the Columbine high school shooting and learn something there.  Partway through that massacre the shooters actually got bored with it and gave up on looking for people to shoot.  On one hand we only can sustain an adrenaline high for limited amounts of time and once that wears off you'll feel a crash as your body's parasympathetic nervous system takes over and you'll want to recover from whatever just happened.  We also know that sociopaths have trouble keeping their interest on one thing for extended periods of time and once the fun wears off they will abandon what once fascinated them.  It's possible that Paddock ran out of adrenaline, came back to reality, and feeling the weight of his actions decided that suicide was the best option.  I'm also curious how you seem to know that he originally planned to escape, was there a detailed scheme which he left behind which somehow didn't include his motive?

Debunking ""nice islamic slavery*

Slaves didn't rule over anything.
Slaves didn't have civil rights.
Slaves were treated like objects with no free will.
If a master killed his slave he wouldn't face the same consequences as if he killed a normal man(which in islam is death) he would just have to free another slave or pay a some of money.
Slaves could buy themselves from the master but only and only if the master agrees to it. And the master is the one who sets the price and he isn't obligated to do anything or accept the trade.
Masters can beat their slaves with no consequences.
Masters can rape their slaves with no consequences.
I can keep going on and on but you get the picture.
And muslim slaves were free men and women before muslims conquered their city and made all women and kids slaves and killed most men.

In the book ""Slavery in the Arab World"" written by Murray Gordon, he mentions that the Muslim Arab slave trade in Africa pre-dated the European African slave trade by a 1000 years and continued for more than a century after the Europeans had abolished the practice. 

The Arab slave trade in Africa could be extremely cruel as well. One particular practice was the mutilation of young African boys, sometimes no more than 9 or 10 years old, to create eunuchs, who brought a higher price in the slave markets of the Middle East. The taking of slaves in raids, on peaceful African villages also had a high casualty rate. Gordon notes that the typical practice was to conduct a pre-dawn raid on an unsuspecting village and kill off as many of the men and older women as possible. Young women and children were then abducted as the preferred booty for the raiders. Young women were targeted because of their value as concubines or sex slaves in markets.

So as long as they don't get a special exception, which will be tricky due to MFN claause, there will be no food exports from UK to the EU before 2022.

But it gets better. The main reason for why the British government decided not to apply, is because they expect to use its food standards as a negotiation offer in a UK-US trade agreement. Which would, incidentally, prevent most of the foods currently crossing the Irish Sea from being allowed into the single market due to the risk of it being substandard.

Thus, enter the IM Bill. Instead of declaring what food standard the UK will employ for 2021, they find it easier to break an international law while making some sweeping comments for the domestic market about how the EU knows exactly what food standards the UK have right now.

As an added bonus... the IM Bill might solve some things, but the rumour has it that most trade going from the GB to NI passes Irish harbours, so unless Johnson finishes his bridge between Scotland and NI before the end of the year, a proper trade war will make the IM Bill completely useless at addressing an embargo against the NI.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601585831,,False,0,{},g7bwkv1,False,t3_j3c6t1,False,False,t1_g7bmxpg,/r/brexit/comments/j3c6t1/eu_brexit_infringement_case_what_is_it_and_should/g7bwkv1/,False,,1613785917,5,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,,0,[],

Having western healthcare standards means that a lot of investment is channeled to healthcare and thereby, to medical education, fact that is not true in eastern european countries where healthcare budgets are much smaller and where the point is to meet minimum requirements instead of aiming for excellence. Also, in terms of research output, you can't simply compare western european countries with their eastern counterparts. The truth is that communistic/authoritarian traits are still not completely gone in eastern europe given that a lot of people who grew up in such regimes are still around and leading stuff. That way of managing things is the biggest enemy of progress. You can see very commonly that medicine study programmes in eastern Europe are not changed for years, even decades as it is the case with Czech Republic/Slovakia/Hungary. Case based learning is simply not a thing yet in eastern Europe, whereas in eastern Europe, it was adopted in some countries almost 15/20 years ago. Also, no stimuli is given for students to be involved in research, not even in the form of a final thesis before graduating, which again, is standard for already 20+ years in western Europe. Favoring long term retention in the form of smaller, more frequent exams is also not a thing in eastern Europe and oral examinations on a very thin slice of the given subject are still the standard in eastern Europe, commonly ending up being unfair and absolutely not representative of the broadness of knowledge in a given student. Not to speak about infrastructure and other material facilities, which are much more developed in western Europe. Just to give you a simple example, there is only one PET-CT machine (very expensive medical imaging method) in the entire Czech Republic while there is sometimes more than one per central hospital in western countries. Sure that this may not directly affect your studies but it shows clearly the willingness to invest and to make thing progress, willingness that is simply not there in eastern Europe with a partial exception of Poland, which is the most economically powerful country in eastern Europe and where this economic prowess is starting to reflect in their ability to invest more in healthcare.

Answering your 2nd question, there is no substantial gap. Once again, in western countries, like you can probably see in Iceland, there are standards and guidelines, being such standards and guidelines so high, that is becomes impossible for an university to fall behind those standards. Of course that in the case of Italy you can say that being the northern Italy richer, they obviously invest more locally in terms of healthcare and hospitals can be a bit better than in their southern counterparts but in general, there is not such an abysmal difference between institutions like you see in eastern Europe. There is much more coordination between different institutions in western Europe and that reflects on overall standards being higher as opposite to eastern Europe, where such coordination simply doesn't exist.

Taxes are part of the reason why a society can be stable and safe. No one likes money going out of their pocket but that money is going to public good, so why not?

 I had a wonderful life in America. I enjoyed my time there moreso than my time in anywhere else in the world. But I was making a good salary and I came from a wealthy family, so I was able to avoid problems with access to health care, top tier education, lack of racism, safety, etc. The American city I was living in is even statistically safer in terms of murder/manslaughter than the very safe Norwegian city I'm living in now. I don't hate America and I know that many people live wonderfully happy lives there. I actually enjoyed it so much that my wife and I plan to move back as soon we can. 

But the US has a serious problem with taking care of its less fortunate. 25 minutes away from one of the safest mid sized cities in the world and you could be in a neighborhood that you shouldn't walk around in at night. Skid Row is a fifteen minute walk away from 9800 euro per month apartments. Part of it is cultural. The US is so individualistic that they turn a blind eye to the struggles of their common man . Most of Europe would rather have as many people as possible be healthy contributors to society, so people don't turn to a life of crime, so they never have to worry about letting their children be sick because they can't afford to pay the bills, so everyone has access to education if they want it. And that is kind of stuff that taxes pay for.

Not to mention, the Americans who complain the most about taxes are the ones who get much more out of tax money than they pay. They just have no idea how it works and what they are getting out of it. Schools, roads, electricity, even internet networks receiving subsidies. But that shouldn't matter. I contributed more in taxes than I get back but I'm perfectly happy to do so as long as it contributes to the stable and safe society that I am living in now.

America is functionally incredibly fucked up in a lot of areas. Everything benefits the rich and fucks over the poor, and especially the lower-middle class. If I vote for tax increases, it's not because I want some minimum wage worker to lose out on 800 dollars from his annual salary, it's because I want services that benefit people like him to receive many times that from people that already have stable lives. I want his kids to receive a good education from public school so that they have opportunities to succeed. Tax money doesn't just dissappear, it's meant to serve the public.

I also do trust the government here to spend the money more wisely than I trust the government in the US to go to. The only States I am willing to move to all contribute more tax money than they get back, and part of that reason is political, which is quite unfortunate. There are elements of that here as well, but to a lesser extent. Norway does have a relatively high defense budget, but its military spending as well as its military actions aren't exactly egregious.

No one likes paying taxes, we just understand that it's necessary and beneficial to our lives. Americans being so scared of taxes is a major symptom of how the country is seriously messed up.

The only comparable countries on slavery are England, Spain and mayyybe France. However those countries all outlawed slavery way before we did, we had way more of them, it didn't take a civil war to outlaw it (except France and even then that was because of a revolt in Haiti, where most of their slaves were), and those free were given immediate de jure equality after being freed while in America they had to wait another 100 years for that. America was by far the biggest abuser of the Atlantic slave trade and even worse in terms of ending. All of this is beside the point because most of the big European powers are in the same class of the US in terms of human violations. 

&gt; We are unique in being a melting pot and a land of opportunity for all comers that play by the rules. 

Whew I needed a drink after this sentence.

This idea with regards to anyone who wasn't a land owning WASP is very recent, and even then I don't know how you can look at the current white house and say that’s true for everyone today. I mean for fucks sake It was normal up to 50 years ago to flat out ban certain ethnicities from immigrating here. We had anti Irish, Chinese, Italian, etc. immigration laws for most of our history. And if they weren’t banned from coming here, like the Germans, they were expected to completely wash away all their culture. Hell we literally have a Muslim ban RIGHT NOW. And then there’s segregation on top of that. The idea that anyone has always been a melting pot is purely propaganda and is an idea no one outside of the US actually believes. Will you live a better life? Sure but you’re going to be a second class citizen until your people become white, like the Italians or Irish. Or your kids or grandkids make enough to go to college but even then your still going to have to deal with racism, like Asians or Hispanics. 

&gt;We are not without fault and our military machine does get a little too aggressive sometimes.

A little too aggressive? Talk about the understatement of the year. Our CIA installed far right dictators throughout Latin America, we funded AL QUEDA just so Afghanistan wouldn't be communist, created the power vacuum that led to the formation of ISIS, funded right wing death squads with arms we sold to Al Qaeda, napalmed all of Vietnam despite it being a war crime, and countless other things that happened in the last 50 years alone. No communist country outside of the Soviet Union and their eastern bloc can even come close to our level of foreign intervention. Plus, this is all ignoring the years before that. I could go more in depth about the massive economic damage the Roosevelt corollary did with the extraction of resources for pennies on the dollar that resulted from it. Or I can talk about how we’ve single handedly protected Israel from accountability for their actions despite the UN general body voting to cite them for human rights violations multiple times. At least countries like France and Germany, who have their own histories of atrocities, have stopped selling arms to them. And lest we forget that we were the last country to stop trading with apartheid South Africa until we were threatened with sanctions ourselves. Meanwhile Castro sent troops to fight the apartheid government. But he’s Mr. Evil according to our version of history. And that’s not to say that he isn’t, (Castro isn’t nearly as bad as Bautista in terms of human rights, or anything really, but he still did some awful shit so do with that what you will.) but the point is that we’ve been on the wrong side of history way more than we’re willing to admit. Also, in a lot of these evil communist countries life actually did improve for the average person. Relative to the rest of the world, there was no better time to live in Russia than the 1950s-1980s Soviet Union. I mean for fucks sake they didn’t abolish feudalism until the 1900s. In fact most polls taken in Russia show most people who were alive at both times say they were better off under the soviet union. Life expectancy, education, and pretty much every other standard of living measure back this up too. Moral of the story is that while these countries had major human rights violations and nothing even remotely close to free speech, the Czars, dictators, or whatever before them were usually worse than whatever the new government did.  

Personally, I agree that there are worse individuals with regards to human rights than any individual president US, no doubt, but to say it’s not close between the US and other countries is pure propaganda. Hell, I’d agree with you that the totality of Russian history (the USSR and Tsardom) is absolutely worse than the US, but it’s a conversation we should still have. Furthermore, the idea that history has good countries and bad countries is one of the most destructive ideas American education has taught us. Of course, the fact you believe this isn’t your fault, we’re indoctrinated with it from the day we’re born. It’s just that most Americans believe that we’re this paragon of justice and everyone else is out to get us when that’s just not true.

That doesn't change for most cities though.  Even if I lived in Dallas, I would likely drive well outside of the city every other month to do something - like a 3 hour drive to Austin or 5 hour drive to Galveston.  I have a friend in Fort Worth and he drives to places outside of Fort Worth as often as I drive to the mountains (lets face it, no one stays in DFW unless they have to)

&gt; That's why buses should be closer to the fifteen minute end than the 30 min end. Bus lanes, priority signalling, all-door boarding, and optimized station distances can all help buses run more quickly. 

That seems unsustainable for most routes.  But even so, in my personal situation I don't even have a transfer and have 10 min headways and my work-&gt; home route has a dedicated bus lane the entire distance - it's still 3x slower than a car.  Of course, that tells me that traffic in Denver just isn't that bad.

&gt; I mean, people seem to manage being car-free in dense cities both in the US, Europe and elsewhere, so they must be figuring it out somehow.

I guess it all comes down to this.  Sure, people manage different lifestyles all over.  Many folks don't have internet or even electricity.  But that is certainly not a lifestyle that I would seek out and that's not how I would want to live.  People go to a store every day to buy groceries and never been to a Costco.  Doesn't mean that they prefer it - they just don't have an option.  People in Europe manage to get by without Lowes or Home Depot too - I certainly wouldn't prefer that because I make 10 trips to the store for every home improvement project I start.

But, a short explanation is that Scandinavian ships were built in a way that both allowed them to travel safely and with good speed across oceans and to navigate rivers. Most coastal countries only built oceangoing ships, reserving river travel for dinghies and rafts and other small craft, while inland countries built rivergoing vessels that did poorly on open water. 

Since both rivers and oceans were open to them, Scandinavian seafarers could reach all the way to northern Africa by going around western Europe, and all the way to the Middle East by following the rivers in eastern Europe, and both routes allowed them into the Mediterranean. The way trade routes were linked meant that Scandinavian merchants had access to goods and cultural artifacts from all of Europe, the Middle East, northern Africa and southern Asia, and vice versa. This economic and cultural aspect is just as important as the military and political aspect.

The general rule for how the Scandinavian cultures influenced conquered areas was that the viking lords did not practice what we today would call colonialism, as they had no strong tendency to view themselves as inherently superior to the peoples that they ended up ruling over. Whether it was Russia, Ukraine, Normandy or the viking-occupied parts of Britain, the viking rulers all ended up absorbing the culture of the areas they settled in. By the point that a conqueror monarch died, their inheriting children had usually taken the native languages and customs of their dominions as their own. Linguistic influences came about because they always do in these situations - in the case of Norse realms in Britannia, they are very visible, possibly because they were adopted naturally and for practical reasons rather than forced upon the Saxons and Celts. The Norse blended into the peoples they settled among, and therefore, they influenced those peoples in ways that can't be done by forced assimilation.

Every time I conquered some more counties, I'd hand 'em off to all the unlanded distant cousins I could find, then transfer their vassalages to various viceroys on a sort of rotating basis. 

I also discovered that little tactic allowed me to instantly summon pretty much all my levies to any part of the map that I needed them on, so I started handing 'em off to whichever viceroyalty was currently the furthest away from the county in question.

In theory. There is a long way between an EU regulation and signatory countries adapting and implementing it in. And then it can be implemented in different ways - for example, employee cannot be forced but may ""give consent"" to do more. Or, like in Poland - no more than 48h/week average in given time period which  is defined by company and can be a quarter (not a week), for example.

The fact that greece will back Armenia is 99% sure, a policy which would go phenomenically against NATO. But again, there are signs that NATO fears Turkey and the distrust and de linking is mutual. Simple put, Turkey is too big to be just another comprador state, and france sees this and this is why they ""verbally"" attack turkey. I dont think that turkey will be in NATO for long, and there are two outcomes in my opinion:
Either Turkey makes a national bourgeoisie ""revolution"", but obviusly from ""above"", and becomes a cosmopolitan bourgeoisie in its own right (this also explaisn the ambition over iraq, Syria, cyprus, libya, azerbaijan e.t.c) with the varius small compradors in the middle east and caucasus, or it joins the Russia-China-Iran nexus. The first is more likelly, but if turkey wants to survive this would mean that Armenia, Cyprus, Libya and Syria should end as indipendent states and become turkey's specific (not EU-NATO) puppet states.

Seeing the recent move, it is sure that Turkey will break soon. But we need more information to determine if turkey will fail or succed. If it wins, then the landscape changes and the big camps in Eurasia become from one to two. But this only if Turkey dont joins China-Russia camp as a regional actor (like Iran).

As the article is writing, we live in the interwar period. A world war 3 is approching, and we need to be alerted and knowledable on the landscape.

Think of it like this one day Pablo Escobar says I'm done I don't want to be a drug dealer this is my charity. Please leave me alone. Ok as good as that sounds he did much damage he should pay for his crimes that he already committed. After he pays for the damages he committed and proves that he reformed and changed his ways he can open all the charities he wants open all the stores he wants I don't care. But he has to prove he reformed himself. Would it be ok if most wanted criminals just went up and said Ok I'm done. I'm not bad anymore? Would it be ok if Hitler just one day said alright guys we won't kill the Jews anymore I promise, I want to open a brewery I'm good now I promise.

If the YPG commanders payed for their crimes and reformed they can do anything they want, until then they're still the same person in my eyes who just got away with everything they did. Them changing their organization name is just a scheme to seem like they're clean in my eyes a front basically. Same goes for PKK members, if they prove they have reformed and won't do the stuff they did in the past, why shouldn't they be able to start new lives?

That's the problem, the South and South-eastern border is already a hard zone to control for Turkey thanks to the PKK, by the way a lot of the drugs that enters Europe from Turkey enters into Turkey from the hard to control south-eastern border. Turkey alleges the YPG(Now the SDF) is a branch of the PKK so that means that if the SDF controls the Syrian Turkish border in the eyes of Turkey thats the PKK controlling the Syrian border aswell as the Iraq border with Turkey.

For convenience I’m mostly just gonna inhabit Morris and Ruskin’s thinking here, that is as far as I can remember.  I’m a student not a teacher of history.  I’m literally a construction worker, but I love this topic and I constantly engage with it and play with it.  I’m not sure what ideas are mine or theirs anymore.  It’s like what some people get out of crossword puzzles.

Iirc Morris’ conception of where architecture should go was of two conditions.  The reversion to slave society must cease, and the crafts re-learned and mass disseminated.  He didn’t think architecture and design were truly possible until they naturally re-emerged under those circumstances, which was the state of things until after a decline starting around the fifteenth century. He like Ruskin imagined civic art and architecture and ornament, now not only the province of stars, but the mass of workmen themselves, would take on a more savage, rude and changeful character, like it had during gothic.  So they *imagined* it might be reminiscent of gothic, but not in any easily describable way. It would be a dream affinity born of the the social conditions resembling those of Middle Ages society Insofar as freer workers meant freer design cohering as the result of something like a natural process, a deep unity of purpose, not unlike the way all modern weapons seem to all kind of go nicely together visually despite not being designed with that in mind. 

I like your formulation.  The effort to divorce beauty from beauty is distinctly commercial.  As neitzshe remarked, there is blood sticking to all good things, but the European Middle Ages saw a stable, non-slave society where racism hadn’t yet shut down a slow, natural East / west architecture and design exchange process peculiar to that time. Part of what later nobles hate about gothic is that it is polluted by Eastern and dark cultures, unlike the thought-to-be pure pagan , classical societies. The whole notion of a “rebirth” was self aggrandizing error tinged with racism (which was either gibberish or a sin in earlier times). What’s more the return of slave and slave-like arrangements made appeals to the pedigree and wisdom of classical notions of natural social order irresistible.  The newly ascendant merchant class supplanted networks of organized craftsmen, and all of this disruption had consequences for design and architecture.  Even peasants’ long-standing belonging to the land could not be abided.

I think art and architecture betokening global concentration of wealth and power, and betokening slavery (in the wider Fredrick Douglas sense including wage slavery) have a very particular character both in how objectionable they are for the conditions most individuals live under, but also the common poverty of design and architecture.  It’s clear things have gotten worse.  For one, we are on the precipice of several man made disasters, and these have arisen substantially as a result of the full unfolding of the historically contingent developments starting around 1400.  

When I work to preserve dingbat apartments it’s not because I find them pretty.  It’s because they hold historical content.  I find them and the historical phenomena they betoken to be ugly, but I find that history useful, and amnesia to be much uglier.  So maybe in 100 years dingbats and brutalism will look cool to everyone, but until then their preservation can inform us, and shape the direction we go if only as a negative example.  Aside from that, Things that are pretty just because they are old are only beautiful in a very shallow sense.  The medievals all agreed on the beauty of what they were building, but their concept of beauty was all tied up in their particular universe.  It was different from ours.  It might have been more like how engineers of stealth aircraft regard their creations.

The physical size of the USA relates to my point.  We don't have some close community of other nations like many in Europe do.  When I was in France, for example, there was mostly French people there, but there was a considerable portion of people from all the neighboring countries.  Those countries are small and people can travel between them very easily and quickly. 

So I imagine Europeans are much, much more used to interacting with people from other countries.  Again, in order to illustrate this, know that the USA (one single country) is roughly the same size of all of Europe (44 countries -- FORTY-FOUR).  So for a European on the internet, his or her first question when interacting with a stranger may be *what country are you from?*  And an American might be more likely to assume the person he is talking to is a fellow American because we rarely ever leave the country and pretty much everyone around us all the time is American too.  And when you take into account Reddit is an American website and the largest group on the website is American, it's not surprising we assume we're talking to Americans most of the time.

My point is this: We assume other people are American most of the time because of our way of life and the facts about Reddit, not because we are stupid or ignorant or oblivious of the world.  That's all.

Why are those the only two choices in your mind?  Why isn’t something like, “Hey guys, this virus is pretty bad but as long as we listen to our scientists we’ll make it through this okay” an option?

We’re nowhere near the best in terms of death rate.  There’s 50+ countries that are better than us.  I’m not sure why you say we’re the best.  Even with all of our medical expertise and infrastructure, we’re worse than most of South America, Central America, and Africa.  Is that really the argument you want to take?  We’re not the absolute worst in the world, so nobody should be complaining?  Tens of thousands of those deaths were completely avoidable if we had had clear federal guidance from the beginning instead of Trump lying and calling it a hoax.

My memory isn’t short.  I know that masks weren’t recommended at first.  It took months after the scientists recommended them for Trump to also recommend them, and he’s still been saying recently that they’re unnecessary and unhelpful.  Just a couple nights ago at the debate he said that masks weren’t all that great and made fun of Biden for wearing one.

Honestly, with everything you’ve been arguing, I shouldn’t be surprised that you think unearned social status is an accomplishment, but I still am.  You’re definitely that kind of person.  Let me guess, you think Trump is accomplished, too, right?  Doesn’t matter that he had every penny handed to him from his daddy, doesn’t matter how many of his daddy’s formerly-functioning businesses he ran into the ground, doesn’t matter how many of his own businesses he ran into the ground, doesn’t matter that he’s in debt to the tune of half a billion dollars with no liquid assets to pay any of it, he’s accomplished because he has a famous name, right?  Fucking pathetic.

His team quite literally STOLE pandemic supplies from states that had already bought them and tried to SELL them to states that also needed them.  And he famously told certain Democrat governors that the national stockpile was for them, not the states (which makes no sense).  

I’d like to see these bills you’re talking about that we’re passed purely because of the lockdowns happening.  Please provide them. 

What else would you call the protests when 96% of them are peaceful, and riots were arbitrarily declared for no reason at a significant portion of the “non-peaceful” protests?  A lot, or maybe even most, of the people destroying property, injuring people, and killing people were far right counterprotestors being supported in most areas by the local police.

I apologize, asking if we should be injecting ourselves with disinfectants and cleaners is totally 100% different in every way than saying bleach instead.  You caught me.  If it’s all that different, maybe you should inject some disinfectants into yourself and let me know how it goes?  And you’re goddamn right Trump isn’t a doctor.  At least you can agree on that.  Maybe, though, you can explain to me why the fuck someone with no medical experience is trying to come up medical treatments on live television in front of actual doctors?  What’s the reasoning behind him doing that?

I didn’t mention WHO.  I mentioned the CDC, which as recently as within the last couple of weeks has been changing federal guidance purely due to political pressures, such as recommending *less* testing.  

Hydroxychloroquine is also proven to increase the death rate, but you didn’t want to mention that part, did you?  I’d like to see the studies showing that hydroxychloroquine improves symptoms.

Trump did not shut down travel to China.  You can’t even get your shit straight.  Trump kept Chinese citizens from coming in but allowed American citizens to travel to and from China for months.  Can you tell me how that helps?  It was the airlines that finally had to decide they weren’t flying to and from China anymore.  Trump didn’t make that decision.  The airlines did it for him.  I’d like to see who called Trump petty for shutting down travel to Europe.  Provide a source.

Trump did not shut down the economy.  He doesn’t have that power.  State governments took care of it all. 

Those nursing home policies you’re talking about were based on the federal recommendations at the time.  Trump is in charge of the federal government.  Those were his recommendations that the states were following, and they were terrible.

I’d like to see where the CDC said that 25%-50% of COVID deaths were completely unrelated to COVID because that honestly sounds like total bullshit you just made up.  Sure, “only” 6% of people who died did not have comorbidities.  Do you know what a comorbidity is?  It’s just any condition that affects your general health.  It’s not just stuff like bone marrow cancer or something that affects almost no one, it’s stuff like obesity.  Obesity is a comorbidity.  40% of this country is obese.  That’s 150,000,000 with a comorbidity right there, and that’s just one of the most common ones.  Well over half the population has at least one comorbidity.  So no, it isn’t exactly reassuring that most people who’ve died from COVID also had comorbidities when you understand that most people in the country have comorbidities.

Yet they still have 273 on order, which is more fighters than most European countries field. Add in the USMC and USAF, and at best you'll get 1/4th of the numbers built. 

It is true that many arms programs are about politics. See the French rifle competition, where they excluded non-EU entrants. They ended up selecting an okay German built version of an American rifle. Likewise, Germany just did the same, although from a different German company. 

Likewise for their underwhelming Eurocopter Tiger. They're all okay, but not the best technology on the market. They're simply jobs programs, and political pandering (home country advantage). But most countries do this worldwide, Europe isn't unique in this. 

There are other things like technology and readiness. SAAB's support is fairly horrific compared to Lockheed/Boeing. They've been underwhelming when it came to maintenance for Hungary's planes. And it doesn't come with the vast training facilities the US has, no country does. When you buy a US fighter you don't just get a plane. You get better access and participation in things like Red Flag, our numerous support and training facilities and the like. Likewise, American weapons are cheaper. As an example, the French precision guided bombs are perfectly fine but had a unit cost of 7-8x that of the American bombs. 

Finland is best served by the F-35 honestly. If they want a serious fighter that is forward thinking and semi future proof that is their only option. Given their location to Russia, I'd say it is worth the money. If they want a cheaper fighter, the Super Hornet offers more versatility than the Euro planes. And if twin engine is too expensive, we can always sell them F-16s. Gripen is a neat little plane, but just underwhelming on a support/deployment scale.

Is it a coincidence or a mistake, a simple fluke, that all social democratic European parties are part of the [Party of European **Socialists**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists)? Is it an error that so many social democratic parties around the world are part of the [**Socialist** International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International)? Is it ignorance that led so many famous social democrats, from [Olof Palme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i2Ws1X5DSA) in the left of social democracy to [Tony Blair](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/11/tonyblair.labour1) in the right of social democracy identifying as **socialists** alongside social democrats? Prominent social democratic philosophers like [Anthony Crosland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Crosland) and [Eduard Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Bernstein) were both socialists and social democrats. [Clement Attlee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Attlee), perhaps the greatest post-WW2 British Labour prime minister, was both a socialist and social democrat.

No, it's not their ignorance or stupidity that led to them identifying as social democrats. It's a tradition that guided them to identifying as such, and a tradition that still makes sense to this day. Social democracy is *not* socialism itself, but it is a socialist philosophy supported by socialists who don't advocate the establishment of an actual socialist society, with state ownership over the means of production, but rather advocate the humanizing of capitalism by **integrating socialist values and principles into it**. This idea forms the very heart and basis of all social democratic parties in Europe, so stop gatekeeping and telling people they aren't social democrats. 

To me, you're a social democrat either if you support the humanization of capitalism through the insertion of socialist principles and values, or if you support a gradual, democratic and reformist transition to socialism. Not all social democrats are socialists; not all socialists are social democrats either, but many social democrats are socialists and many socialists are social democrats.

Also, just because that person is an American, if they even are an American because I don't know, doesn't mean they are ignorant and don't know what social democracy is.

Or, if you want to cut your base weight in half:

Everything looks great until I realize it in kg's not pounds.  BW of 8.23 kg and my BW is 8.3 pounds (and I'm in Alaska, so it's not like we're dealing with different climates).

Pack, Tent and Sleeping bag each could weigh half as much.   I'd save up for a high-end synthetic quilt first (Well, \*\*I\*\* have a down quilt, but you can look at synthetic quilts).  Skip the liner immediately - they never justify their weight for the slight added warmth.  You have a synthetic bag - far easier to wash at home (you're European, I assume you have a front-loader washing machine).

I'd suggest waiting to upgrade the tent until last (Yeah, I know, usually you should buy your pack last).  My logic: a roomy tent under 500 grams isn't cheap (e.g. ZPacks Duplex).  And, if you develop the skills and comfort level to use a tarp, then you can save lots of weight and lots of money by going that route, at least when there's decent weather/bugs.  And you'll still aha the Lashan when you want an enclosed shelter.

Stove+Pot could be 1/4 the weight.  As schmuckmulligan suggested, a BRS-3000T and a Toaks pot or just $5, 45-gram aluminum cup.

Bring the battery bank if you must, but try seeing how long your phone's internal battery lasts in Airplane Mode / Off.  I do 4 trips like that.  Around town, airplane mode doesn't save as much battery.  When you're in the wilderness and far from any cell site, airplane mode saves a LOT of power not transmitting to a distant tower.

Yes, spoon only.  I like a $1, 8-inch / 20-cm bamboo spoon, but 9 inches, 23 cm is even nicer for freeze-dried food and freezer-bag cooking.

The Spot 350 is a lot of light.  There are several options 1/3 that weight (like Petzl's Bindi).  Try carrying your light at waist-level.  Then the shadows help you see the dips and bumps in the trail.  If you use a headlamp on your head, all the trail contours get washed out.  Also, when your light is rechargeable, you start EVERY trip with a full charge instead of losing track of how long you've used that set of batteries.  One of the few items I suggest ADDING to many load-outs is a $10, 10-gram NiteCore Tube.  51 hours of low which is (barely) enough to hike an established trail or 1 hour of 45 lumens.  Because it is enough to finish any trip, I am then more liberal with my main, 30-gram light.

The Gregory pack isn't wrong as a starter pack.  I'm old, so my starter pack was over twice as heavy.

Germany's huge dye trust (or chemical cartel) known as the I. G. Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft, enjoyed a monopoly on all chemical products manufactured in Germany. German IG made an alliance with American Standard Oil in order to control important patents. The general idea was that the two were to pool their processes. This was done — in a one-sided way.”

[The Drug Story](http://whale.to/a/bealle.htm)
Morris A. Bealle, 1949


“In Europe, likewise, the Rockefeller-Standard Oil gang was confronted with a problem created by British resentment at the Rockefeller takeover of the Dye Trust, the I. G. Farbenindustrie. As a consequence, they could not secure visas for personnel and clearance for their vessels that would enable them to develop the Saudi Arabian oilfields. The concession had been granted them by the British vassal King Ibn Saud, as a prized bit of loot in return for forcing the U.S. to come to the rescue of the Allies in World War I. The conspirators built up Hitler, through their agents 
and through. their I. G. Farbenindustrie (15:115f) as a menace to England to force her to remove the barrier to their development of that bonanza, Saudi Arabia. (7; 15)”

""In late November 2000, hundreds of mostly middle-aged male protesters, dressed in off-the-peg suits and cautious ties, descended on the Miami-Dade polling headquarters in Florida. Shouting, jostling, and punching, they demanded that a recount of ballots for the presidential election be stopped.

The protesters, many of whom were paid Republican operatives, succeeded. A recount of ballots in Florida was abandoned. What became known as the Brooks Brothers riot went down in infamy, and George W Bush became president after a supreme court decision.

It's meaning is much more insidious and antithetical to the American Foundational principles.  We didn't root the basis of democracy in national ethnicity, language, or religion.  We rooted in the single foundation that bound all of America, self-government and representation.

We fought the British originally not for independence, but for sovereignty and representation in parliament.  When that failed we revolted and installed our own republic.  One that believed in the rights of the individual that bound society together under a constitution for the people, by the people, and of the people.

The Modern idea of Nationalism came from European empirical states.  The idea of nationalism was populist in nature.  It was exclusionary.  It was zero-sum (Which time and time again has shown us nothing but misery in humanity).  It was about the national conscious without regards to the individual.  The people in nationalist societies weren't free and self-governing as a people, but as collectivist national state- their governments.  Sovereignty resides in the state, not the people according to nationalism (Which will quickly devolve into ultra nationalism and fascism).  The state is above the people, not for, of, or by the people.  

This runs counter to what makes Americans Exceptional.  No it is not ethnic, language, or religious background.  It has it's foundation in the Universal American Creed.  The belief in natural law, liberty, limited government, individual rights, the checks and balances of government, popular sovereignty.

There is nothing universal about nationalism, except that all national-isms are different and particular.   These ideas don't reside in the heart of nationalism.  Nationalism is devoid of a common idea or principle.  There is no creed.  In Nationalism, a dictator can rule just as much as a democracy.  It's all about the state remember.  Nationalists doubt the importance of the American Creed.  They think it isn't important to our identity.  

A strong majority almost wish in whitewashing our textbooks and taking out anything that may leave a stain on our nation.  This is the most dangerous form of censorship, almost akin to book burning.  The truth washes away leaving nothing to build on.  Nothing to improve, a principle with the structural integrity of shifting sand.

Free markets literally have no government intervention, the US used to be a free market until a mining company destroyed a town to mine near there or when a ton of companies started poisoning civilians by dumping toxic materials into clean water.   
I was born in Saudi Arabia, not long after the US armed terrorist groups and fucked over a lot. My family were war refugees, though I was a product of rape from a US troop.   
Afghanistan used to be a thriving place of culture and technology, then the US helped built an extremist government by funding it which then brough decades of Sharia Law to oppress everyone. Look up what Afghanistan looked like in the 70s, it looks a lot like the 70s in the US. Did you know that Osama Bin Laden was a teacher and was adamantly against war and murder before the terrorist organizations YOUR country built?  


I live in the US now, but I went to school in those ""socialist"" countries you hate so much. They were far better, if I still lived there I wouldn't be as fucked as I am from a disability than I am here.  
$475,000 in debt and my issues still arent fixed and my limbs still turn purple when in reality, all they need to do is cut the flexor retinaculum but ""its the last resort and they dont want to do it""

Even a shithole uncivilised country like russia has it.  
Fun fact, it's cheaper to travel to europe and get a doctor there where you have to pay out of pocket and stay there for a week than it is to get the same surgery in the US.  
In Australia, a carpal tunnel surgery costs $200USD, in the US it costs over $4000USD.  
You know you have a problem when the country to started a war with emus and lost has saner medical prices. But no, we let insurance companies fuck us over the then we let the government privatize everything which then causes the cost of living to sky rocket.

Sorry, but I have a PhD in psychology, I spent a lot of time getting that degree and I would like to use it instead of working for minimum wage at a Sheetz.   
Might I add that I can't flip burgers because I have bad carpal tunnel so my options are very limited with the only one that I might be able to get enough money to the surgery I need being making and selling meth.  
Walmart wouldn't hire me as a greeter because I'm overqualified, also I have to be able to hold things without dropping them.  
The other systems actually rarely cause harm, the people who think it's harmful and evil tend to be indoctrinated by propaganda.

This is because the netcode is terrible and people will get 250+ms latency from EU to US and vice versa. 

There is also no gproxy, lag screen, reconnect or any sort of feature that prevents dcs. You will see people drop often.

For other maps that are more causal and not reaction based like Survival Chaos, Footmen, Risk, TDs there is a medium sized community left, but it's all definitely smaller than pre reforged.

**2020 Pre-Season Recap**

*Transfer News*

PURCHASED Charles Dunne, 66 OVR CB, AGE 27, bought from Motherwell for 800k

LOAN IN Andrea Colpani CM, 67 OVR, AGE 21, 1 year loan form Atalanta

PURCHASED Karamoko Dembele 68 OVR RW, AGE 17, bought from Celtic for 1.5M

LOAN IN Loic Badiashile, 68 OVR GK, Age 22, 1 year loan from AS Monaco

LOAN IN Tiago Reis,69 OVR ST, Age 20, 1 year loan from Vasco Da Gama

LOAN IN Ethan Galbraith, 65 OVR CDM, AGE 19, 1 year loan from Manchester United

LOAN IN Lucas Chevalier, 66 OVR GK, AGE 18, 1 year loan from LOSC Lille

LOAN IN Pablo Martinez, 66 OVR CM, AGE 22, 1 year loan from Levante UD

LOAN IN Euan Henderson, 65 OVR ST, AGE 20, 1 year loan from Hearts

LOAN IN Andrei Ratiu, 65 OVR RB, AGE 22, 1 year loan from Villarreal CF

LOAN IN Joao Ferreira, 67 OVR RB, Age 19, 1 year loan from SL Benfica

SOLD Vaclav Hladky, 68 OVR GK, Age 29, sold to SPAL for 980K

SOLD Kyle Magennis, 66 OVR CM, AGE 21, sold to Wigan Athletic for 1.9M

PURCHASED Aster Vranckx, 64 OVR CM, AGE 17, bought form KV Mechelen for 1.5M

PURCHASED Nemanja Antonov, 66 OVR LB, AGE 25, bought from Excel Mouscron for 650K

We will always look to loan in 5 outfield players per season, bought this year I thought we needed a little bit extra help and we went after an extra 2 players. Andrei Ratiu &amp; Joao Ferreira were brought in to help solidify the back line. Both will feature across the back line.

The very first purchase I wanted to make was to begin to build the spine of the team, and Charles Dunne from Motherwell was the player we targeted. The 27 year old, Irish national will captain the team and lead the defense for the foreseeable future.

The markee signing off the summer was 17 year old english international Karamoko Dembele from Celtic for 1.5M. This was a statement signing.

After Vranckx is a unit at just 17 years old. The Belgian is a true box to box midfielder. We have high hopes that Vranckx can not only contribute in the middle of the park, but also help score goals in the final third. Pogba at Juve esque.

We brought in Namanja Antonov due to the fact we had no natural LB on the team. The price for the talent was great. The Serb is very well rounded.

***Emirates Cup Results***

going into this pre-season I was focused on trying to establish an identity before a crucial start to the season against Rangers, Hearts, Motherwell, Hibs &amp; Aberdeen, in that order. Rangers, Hearts &amp; Aberdeen all finished top 4 last year, qualifying for Europe. We start our league campaign against 5 teams who are top 6 favorites. We  settled on a 4-1-2-3 formation. A very narrow formation that features a CDM, 2 Midfielders, a LF, RF &amp; a Striker.

We traveled to Italy for pre-season to participate in an Emirates sponsored pre-season cup. Pordenone (Italy), IF Elfsborg (Sweeden), Helsignborgs IF (Sweetden) were in group A with us. Group B featured Juve Stabia (italy), Spezia (Italy), Pisa (Italy) and Serbian Juggernauts Red Star Belgrade.

*Group Record*

1-0 WIN vs HIF

1-1 DRAW vs ELF

4-1 WIN vs POR

We went through top of the group. Pordenone finished 2nd.

*Semi final*

2 -1 WIN vs PISA

*Final*

1-1 WIN ON PENS vs Crvena Zvezda

*Goal Scorers*

ST Reis, ST Morias &amp; RW Dembele all with 2 goals

ST Henderson, CM MacPherson &amp; CAM McGrath each with a goal.

*Assist*

ST Junior Morias 3

RM Kyle McAllister 2

RM Ferreira, CAM McGrath 1

***Next 5 games***

*vs Rangers*

@ Hearts

vs Motherwell

vs Hibs

@ Aberdeen

The start of the season is brutal &amp; haven't settled on a formation yet, even though I do have a better understanding for the squad, even though the competition is fierce among the squad. We will look forward to grabbing at minimum 5 of the possible 15 points. If we can manage this I will be optimistic going into the next 5 games against Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Livingston, Ross County &amp; Celtic..",True,False,False,,,,0,1601613639,,False,0,{},g7dac2h,False,t3_j3o7x1,False,True,t3_j3o7x1,/r/seriousfifacareers/comments/j3o7x1/st_mirren_10_year_challenge_preseason_year_1/g7dac2h/,False,,1613809524,1,True,False,seriousfifacareers,t5_2m6gw5,r/seriousfifacareers,public,,0,[],

This mindset is at the root of why we can't seem to do anything (even proven taactics) to improve the situation.

You look at a worse case and assume that's the maority of the homeless population. What about the vast majority of homeless that aren't mentally ill and addicted?

And housing first efforts make treating mentally ill and addicted people much easier. 


**Acting like the only option  is to lock them up is such a terrible take**


[**Homelessness in America**](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7552441/homeless-facts-myths)

&gt;Serious mental illnesses are more prevalent among the homeless: About one in four sheltered homeless people suffered from a severe mental illness in 2010, compared to 5 percent of US adults, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). 

&gt;**But city officials cited lack of affordable housing**, unemployment, and poverty as the top three causes of homelessness in a 2014 survey from the US Conference of Mayors.

&gt;Roughly one-third of sheltered homeless adults had chronic substance use issues in 2010, according to the SAMHSA.

So your portrayal of homeless people as *""addicted and mentally ill... living on the streets and self medicating""* is a little simplistic

**Housing First in Finland**

&gt;**Finland** is the only European Union country where homelessness is currently falling.[2] The country has adopted a **Housing First policy**, whereby social services assign homeless individuals rental homes first, and issues like mental health and substance abuse are treated second.[3][4] 

  -  **Since its launch in 2008, the number of homeless people in Finland has decreased by roughly 30%,[1] and the number of long-term homeless people has fallen by more than 35%**


See? People CAN be helped and are being helped. 


This mindset that nothing can be done without rounding up and trampling on the liberties of people is so myopic

**What to do?**

[Why America Needs More Social Housing](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/america-needs-social-housing/)



&gt;**AMERICAN VISITORS TO Vienna are typically struck by the absence of homeless people on the streets**. And if they ventured around the city, they’d discover that there are no neighborhoods comparable to the distressed ghettos in America’s cities, where high concentrations of poor people live in areas characterized by high levels of crime, inadequate public services, and a paucity of grocery stores, banks, and other retail outlets.

&gt;Since the 1920s, Vienna has made large investments in social housing owned or financed by the government. **But unlike public housing in the United States, Vienna's social housing serves the middle class as well as the poor, and has thus avoided the stigma of being either vertical ghettos or housing of last resort**.

[**Vienna leads globally in affordable housing and quality of life**](https://archinect.com/news/article/150074889/vienna-leads-globally-in-affordable-housing-and-quality-of-life)

&gt;**In Vienna 62% of its citizens reside in public housing, standing in stark contrast with less than 1% living in US social housing**. The Austrian capital boasts regulated rents and strongly protects tenant's rights, while US public housing functions as a last resort for low-income individuals. Earlier this year Vienna was listed at the top of Mercer's Quality of Living Ranking, beating every city in the world for the ninth year in a row. Needless to say US cities have much to learn from Vienna's urban housing model.

[Vienna Offers Affordable and Luxurious Housing](https://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/gov-affordable-luxurious-housing-in-vienna.html)


&gt;A unique system nearly a century in the making has created a situation today in which **the city government of Vienna either owns or directly influences almost half the housing stock in the capital city**. As a result, residents enjoy high-quality apartments with inexpensive rent, along with renters’ rights that would be unheard of in the U.S. The Viennese have decided that housing is a human right so important that it shouldn’t be left up to the free market.

That war was unnecessary. Russia did not invade Georgia but only prevented bloodshed. It was NATO's test against Russia. The then president of Georgia was working for NATO/US. Later he became a statesman in Ukraine, again working for EU/NATO/US. The picture was very clear. Ukraine was like Armenia, would join CSTO, though it pulled out because of anti-Russia sentiment in Ukraine, which was divided between pro and anti Russia. After US involvement, the anti-Russia side got the power back by coup. They made sure pro-Russia side never to get power again. But they still have to rely on Russia for economy, that's the funny thing. The pro-EU/anti-Russia side expected big from EU/NATO/US. But they got Biden and his son instead who further corrupted the politics and economy. They deserved it, I would say because it was too obvious so the then Ukrainian president did not take the bait from EU and IMF and he was doomed. I would say Russia should have stopped all economic activities with Ukraine already, except the gas export, because that would be the fastest way to let them learn the reality. 

Georgia is walking on that tightrope too. Georgian activists, trained by US NGOs wanted badly to boycott Russia and they got it, and Georgia's tourism paid for it. Wait and see for more. 

&gt;Greece could absolutely call in the collective defense.

Turkey can do the same. NATO doesn't really care what Greece needs, actually. They wouldn't mind if Greece no longer exist. They just needed Greece from Russia. That's all. The main target is always Russia. Cold War has never ended. 

Turkey is more important than Greece. But EU is sanctioning Turkey, which is not an EU member. I cannot give opinion on that. 

CSTO is not economic alliance. It's purely military. Russia, Georgia, Armenia... need it for their existence and collective strength. But Russia would not get too involved between Armenia and Azerbaijan as long as the war is only within Nagorno-Karabakh region. I also believe the war will not go beyond it.

I've lived in EU for 15 years. I worked as a mentor for foreign exchange students for 10 years. Based on what you've shared.  You wouldn't be an attractive candidate to recommend or sponsor. 

You're enthusiastic and that is great, but the reality is that studying abroad in HS is different from Uni, which is different from working.   A year isn't long enough to demonstrate that you have integrated and created roots. 

Your competition will be all the German citizens, EU citizens, perma res card holders, then the other international students.   In the schools I've worked in (FR and BE. I can't speak for DE, but I imagine it is similar)  Student are categorized as foreign vs exchange.    
Normally near the end of the 2nd year the foreign students will start to be asked about job opportunities, and companies will reach out to them.  The exchange students don't get the same opportunity, because they are considered high risk. 

I know one exchange student who was able to work around this, but that was because he studied abroad in HS and had a host family. His host father spoke to a friend, and that person gave him a job.  


So it will be an uphill battle but if you do the work, you don't know what will happen

Top suggestions

1 CVs  
Create a linkedin page and CVS, if you don't have them already.  Tell people about them.  You may not have the right to work, but you can start selling yourself.

2 Network  
I don't know what your are studying, but don't limit yourself to just that department.  Reach out to the others, and take advantage off the events and lectures.  You just need to find that one person who will give you a chance, you don't know where they will be.  Push your self.

3 Ask for help  
You should have a student counselor. Reach out to them right away.  They should be able to guide you in a more focused direction.   
Talk to your host family (assuming you had one since you lived abroad). Maybe they know someone.  Talk to students, really anyone who has ears.  Everyone should know you are looking to stay and work.

4 Have a plan B.    
Look into becoming  TEFL (teaching English as a foreign language) certification.  You might hate English and Teaching, but it is a good stepping stone.     
If you want to live in EU it's good to have because it is something you can always fall back on. It is the easiest way to sell yourself.    
Schools and Companies love Native English speakers for teachers.  I just went back to school. I'm in my second week and I've already have multiple people asking about me teaching there. 

5. Have a plan  
You don't want to say, ""I'm looking for anything"", that will make you come off as desperate. You want to be determined.   
Ideally you want a X job,  or something in X career.    
If that doesn't work, you are looking for plan B. eg teaching English (or something else you come up with)  
If both of those fail, plan C an apprenticeship or internship, but you are open to options to find out what is out there.  
(Even if you are unsure and don't know what you want, have a general direction of where you want to go.)

6.  Fall in love and get married.  
Everything becomes mildly easier, plus you get the EU discount since you sort of are considered an EU citizen.

If you had gone through the Holocaust, would you want to live next to the very people who did those horrifying, revolting things to you?
The Jewish have throughout history been subjected to horrendous acts of cruelty.
Since they are originally from the region they decided to buy the land from the colonisers.

Now, this is where you begin to judge historical decisions with modern morals. Colonising has been going on for millennia, that simply used to be the way of life, nationality meant nothing, only borders were that of kingdoms and empires.
There was nothing wrong with purchasing the land from the conquerors but I do not condone the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

Where could the Jews have gone? Can you produce another continental shelf from under the oceans for them to settle on?
And are we going to deny the fact that the Arabs themselves were expansionist and conquered large swathes of land in Europe?

Eu ia escrever alguma coisa mas o que a pessoa de cima escreveu está tão lindo que merece destaque.

Em minha opinião, faltou uma coisa muito Importante na sua ""relação"" com essa sua amiga que é o DIÁLOGO.
Gente, dialogo é tudo. Vc precisa sentar e conversar ncom essa pessoa e explicar tudo que vc não gosta na sua relação de amizade com ela.
As pessoas se esquecem que a relação de amizade, também é uma relação e ela precisa ser trabalhada. Mas hoje no mundo tão plástico das redes sociais, acabamos por esquecer isso.

Não acredito que essa pessoa seja maníaca ou qualquer coisa do gênero, o que está faltando é compreensão e muita para entender o próximo.

Veja, não me leve a mal. Não estou aqui dizendo que o que vc relatou não tem importância ou é sem sentido, só estou dizendo que para vc entender os problemas de uma pessoa só vivenciando os problemas delas.

Você tem algum problema que te exclua do seu social?
Você tem algum problema de socialização?
Pelo que entendi você não tem nada, então tente entrar na vida dessa pessoa e compreenda que a vida dela não deve ser fácil. Principalmente quando se é deficiente.

Não diminui nenhum comentário feito por ninguém aqui, mas precisamos entender que em muitos dos casos faltou empatia para compreender ou enxergar o problema como um todo.

E, não ela não tem autismo. Se tivesse pode ter certeza que ela não estaria se socializando. Trabalhei anos com autista e pode ter certeza que esse não é um comportamento de um autista. Isso é um comportamento de uma pessoa que está completamente desesperada para sair da solidão. Ajude essa pessoa converse com ela. E não trate essa pessoa pelos seus problemas.

And first helped me understand I am using a wrong tool. 

On second call offered me to send new set of bolts as I have done goofed. (I would only pay shipping)

If you need to work, then it only really makes sense to live in an English-speaking country. Yes, big cities across Europe have some English-only jobs but they are a tiny minority contrary to what people on this subreddit might say, even in English-friendly places like the Netherlands. 
  
Life will be very different. Not saying that as a bad thing, but you need to remember that Portland is probably the most liberal and, yeah, “weird” cities on the planet. Houses in Europe are much smaller than the US. Having viewed houses in Portland before you need to be prepared for double the price and half the size. Almost no houses in cities like London will have a big garden, even in the suburbs (you’ve got to fit those 10 million people somewhere). Childcare in London is very expensive, close to what you’re paying now even though salaries are less.

Elle relève déjà que le consentement doit être donné librement et  afin de tenir compte de la jurisprudence du Conseil d’État, prévient que  « *le fait de subordonner la fourniture d’un service ou l’accès à un  site web à l’acceptation d’opérations d’écriture ou de lecture sur le  terminal de l’utilisateur (pratique dite de « cookie wall ») est  susceptible de porter atteinte, dans certains cas, à la liberté du  consentement* ». Ce sera donc apprécié au cas par cas.

Cette prudence devrait passer entre les griffes de la juridiction  administrative. L’autorité ajoute que l’utilisateur devra bénéficier  d’une information préalable sur les conséquences de ses choix « *et notamment l’impossibilité d’accéder au contenu ou au service en l’absence de consentement* ».

Autre mise au clair, lorsqu’une multitude de traitements est  envisagée par un site, la CNIL invite chaudement son responsable à opter  pour un système d’acceptation par finalité, au risque d’égratigner la  liberté de choix de l’internaute. Dans la recommandation, néanmoins,  elle juge possible de proposer des boutons d’acceptation et de refus  globaux (« *tout accepter* » et « *tout refuser* », « *j’autorise* » et « *je n’autorise pas* », « *j’accepte tout* » et « *je n’accepte rien* ») permettant de consentir ou refuser en une seule action à plusieurs finalités.

Consciente des pièges du design, elle recommande « *de ne pas induire en erreur les utilisateurs* » avec des interfaces trompeuses, celles «  *laissant penser aux utilisateurs que leur consentement est obligatoire  ou qui mettent visuellement plus en valeur un choix plutôt qu’un autre* ». Une pratique malheureusement courante.

### Un consentement accompagné de nombreuses informations

De même, elle refuse que le consentement soit noyé dans les conditions générales d’utilisation : «  *Le consentement à ces opérations ne peut être valablement recueilli via  une acceptation globale de conditions générales d’utilisation* », sauf à porter atteinte au caractère spécifique de ce consentement.

Il doit être épaulé par une information préalable, « *rédigée en des termes simples et compréhensibles par tous* » et permettant « *aux utilisateurs d’être dûment informés des différentes finalités des traceurs utilisés* ». Dit autrement, pas de terminologie juridique ou technique trop complexe « *susceptible de rendre incompréhensible cette information par les utilisateurs* ». Dans le même ordre d’idée, «  *l’information doit être complète, visible et mise en évidence. Un  simple renvoi vers les conditions générales d'utilisation ne saurait  suffire* ».

Cette information doit comprendre a minima les points suivants :

&amp;#x200B;

* « *L’identité du ou des responsables de traitement des opérations de lecture ou écriture ;* »
* « *La finalité des opérations de lecture ou écriture des données ;* »
* « *La manière d’accepter ou de refuser les traceurs ;* »
* « *Les conséquences qui s’attachent à un refus ou une acceptation des traceurs ;* »
* « *L’existence du droit de retirer son consentement* »

Les sites devront soigner ce chapitre : « *ainsi, la liste exhaustive et à jour* \[des responsables de traitement et des responsables conjoints\] *doit être rendue accessible de façon simple aux utilisateurs* ». Elle avertit que la fameuse liste doit être mise à disposition des utilisateurs de manière permanente, « *à un endroit aisément accessible à tout moment sur le site web ou l’application mobile* ».

L’éditeur d’un site qui dépose des traceurs est un responsable de traitement, tout comme les tiers «  *qui utilisent des traceurs sur un service édité par un autre organisme,  par exemple en déposant des traceurs à l’occasion de la visite du site  d’un éditeur, dès lors qu’ils agissent pour leur propre compte* ».

Et s’agissant des finalités, la Commission demande à ce que « *chaque finalité soit mise en exergue dans un intitulé court et mis en évidence, accompagné d’un bref descriptif* ». Elle fournit plusieurs exemples : «  *Publicité personnalisée : \[nom du site / de l’application\] \[et des  sociétés tierces / nos partenaires\] utilise / utilisent des traceurs  afin d’afficher de la publicité personnalisée en fonction de votre  navigation et de votre profil* ».

### La poursuite de la navigation ne vaut pas consentement

La CNIL rappelle que « *continuer à naviguer sur un site web, à  utiliser une application mobile ou bien faire défiler la page d’un site  web ou d’une application mobile ne constitue pas des actions positives  claires assimilables à un consentement valable* ».

Elle s’appuie également sur la jurisprudence de la CJUE, dans [l’affaire Planet49 du 1er octobre 2019](https://www.nextinpact.com/article/29693/108255-pour-justice-europeenne-case-precochee-ne-vaut-pas-consentement-aux-cookies) : pas de cases précochées. «  *En l’absence de consentement exprimé par un acte positif clair,  l’utilisateur doit être considéré comme ayant refusé l’accès à son  terminal ou l’inscription d’informations dans ce dernier* ».

À ce titre, l’expression du refus de l’utilisateur ne doit pas  davantage nécessiter de démarche de la part de l’internaute. Elle doit  même « *pouvoir se traduire par une action présentant le même degré de simplicité que celle permettant d’exprimer son consentement* ».  Elle propose d’utiliser un lien accessible à tout moment depuis le site  ou le service concerné, histoire que le refus soit aussi facilement  exprimé que l’acceptation.

Le RGPD s’appuyant sur une logique d’« *accountability* », les responsables de traitement doivent toujours être «  *en mesure de fournir, à tout moment, la preuve du recueil valable du  consentement libre, éclairé, spécifique et univoque de l’utilisateur* ». Sauf à subir une possible sanction.

### Pas de renvoi dans les paramètres du navigateur

Autre détail fourni, [l’article 82 de la loi CNIL](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037813978/2019-06-01/)  prévient que la question du consentement peut également être traitée  dans les paramètres du navigateur. Seulement, la commission estime  encore à ce jour que ces paramètres ne sont pas assez fins en l’état de  développement de ces logiciels. Ils ne distinguent pas assez les  finalités.

De plus « *si les navigateurs web proposent de nombreux réglages  permettant aux utilisateurs d’exprimer des choix en matière de gestion  des cookies et autres traceurs, ceux-ci sont généralement exprimés  aujourd’hui dans des conditions ne permettant pas d’assurer un niveau  suffisant d’information préalable des personnes, de nature à respecter  les principes rappelés dans les présentes lignes directrices* ».

### Des traceurs sans consentement

Ces lignes concernent les traceurs publicitaires en premier lieu,  mais non ceux exempts de consentement, en particulier les outils servant  uniquement à l’authentification.

Même régime pour « *les traceurs conservant le choix exprimé par les utilisateurs sur le dépôt de traceurs* »  (dont la durée de validité sera de 6 mois), ou encore s’agissant de  ceux destinés à personnaliser l’interface, ceux calés sur la seule  mesure d’audience anonymisée, ou « *les traceurs permettant aux sites  payants de limiter l’accès gratuit à un échantillon de contenu demandé  par les utilisateurs (quantité prédéfinie et/ou sur une période limitée)*  ».

### Nouvelle tolérance : 6 mois de délai pour la mise en conformité

La CNIL a une nouvelle fois fait preuve de mansuétude à l’égard des  acteurs. Elle ouvre un délai de mise en conformité aux nouvelles règles  de six mois. Le monde du marketing en ligne et les responsables de  traitement auront à suivre religieusement cette nouvelle doctrine au  plus tard fin mars 2021.

Entretemps, la CNIL, sur invitation du Conseil d’État, se réserve la  possibilité de sanctionner les manquements les plus graves sur l’autel  de la vie privée. Elle « *continuera à poursuivre les manquements aux  règles relatives aux cookies antérieures à l’entrée en vigueur du RGPD,  éclairées par sa recommandation du 5 décembre 2013* ».

De scris nu stiu cine l-ar fi putut scrie, e important totusi si cine erau atunci editorii/sefii de redactie la Adevarul (deci cine decidea cine si ce sa se scrie), si din cate stiu eu la Adevarul erau Tinu, CTP si Novaceanu (un nume pe care il uitasem dar pe care mi l-am reamintit vazand al doilea tau link, un securist pur-sange).

Later edit: Cautand mai multe despre acel Novaceanu am dat peste pagina lui de [wiki](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darie_Nov%C4%83ceanu) (mi-era teama ca poate il facusem securist pe nedrept, pe urma am vazut ca a fost pus la Adevarul imediat dupa '89 de catre Iliescu si Brucan si m-am linistit) unde este mentionat un articol de-ale lui din 15 iunie, ""Cavalerii Apocalipsului"", pe care articol l-am gasit [pe aceasta](https://muzeu.unibuc.ro/ro/fpu30-cavalerii-apocalipsului/) pagina a Muzeului Universitatii Bucuresti (un TIL pt mine acest muzeu). Niste citate din 2 in 4:

&gt; organizatorii violenței erau foarte bine informați cu privire la slăbiciunile forțelor de ordine și chiar și ale armatei. Tocmai de aceea au mers atât de departe, încercând asaltarea puterii. Pentru că, trebuie s-o recunoaștem fără ocolișuri, acest mecanism diabolic, înșurubat în Piața Universității, avea drept scop ultim lovitura de stat.

(...)

&gt; Oricâte lucruri urâte se vor spune – și se vor spune – despre acești oameni, despre muncitorii din București și din împrejurimi și despre minerii noștri,  prezența lor era absolut necesară pentru a anihila violența forțelor extremiste, în mijlocul cărora mulți intelectuali și foarte mulți ziariști s-au simțit și par să se simtă în continuare foarte bine.

(geniala asta, dă si in cei din Piata si in general da in ""mulți intelectuali și foarte mulți ziariști"", cand si cand mai uit de lozinca ""noi muncim, nu gandim"" spusa in acei ani dar citate precum acesta ma intorc la momentu ala)

&gt; redactorii ziarului «Adevărul» s-au aflat azi în toate punctele prin care s-a scurs în ultimele ore șarpele violenței. Acum când anihilarea acestuia începe să devină o certitudine, rămânând vigilenți, se cuvine să ne întoarcem la casele și locurile de muncă. Fie care liniștea să se așeze din nou peste acest pământ, ocrotind arborele plăpând al libertății noastre.

CTP-ul nu avea nici o problema sa lucreze direct sub acest om si i-a preluat mai departe discursul (desi un pic mai atenuat), eu tinandu-l minte mai ales pt tiradele anti-NATO de la sfarsitul anilor '90 si pt prietenia lui ""intelectuala"" cu minerii lui Cozma.

Hi! In terms of resources for further research, there are millions and it is hard to list them. People in this field can be quite eager to share their thoughts and experiences. There are facebook groups about young people in international development, etc. Check out /r/nonprofit which I think is a bit more active than here to see what people are working in. There are some important questions you need to ask yourself, at your age the biggest being: *why* do you want to work in international development? What is it that interests you about it? There's a famous list of seven types of donors and how to get them to donate to you, but I think it applies to people working in dev as well to some extent. Like all models it cannot represent reality completely, and people can fall into more than one category.

**1) The Altruist.** “Do the Right Thing” is more than just a movie for this donor, and they don’t care about the credits. Altruists just care about helping without fanfare or recognition.

**2) Communitarian.** Civic responsibility to the community matters most, whether that community is based on geography, race, generation or another common characteristic.

**3) Devout.** We’re talking commitment, not religion – although it could involve commitment to a religion. Devout people work in dev because of their strong belief in a group or cause and the desire to align with fellow devotees. Very often, because they experienced something they do not want others to experience (for example campaigning for better alternative care for children after growing up in an orphanage).

**4) Dynast.** Giving/helping is a family tradition. It’s in their blood and has been for generations. Dynasts give not only to support the cause, but to contribute to a legacy

**5) Investor.** What are the tax and estate implications? What’s the ROI? Is it good business? Some people work in international development for big international organisations and make some serious dough. They're in it for the money but they often bring very important skills to the table.

**6) Repayer.** It’s all about gratitude and returning the favor. Whether it’s a school, a hospital or a fireman, this person feels a sense of loyalty or obligation to help those who have helped him or her.

**7) Socialite.** Lights, camera, action! These people want to show the world how good they are, and if there can be a bit of glitz and glamour, even better (frequently work in fundraising and do not last in the field for very long). Instagram is full of richkid dev ""workers"" who seem to do everything except work, but I'm just being cynical.

Maybe you recognise yourself among these, and it can help you identify your own reasons. You need to know yourself. It's okay not to have a specific cause you are especially passionate about, but it does help to have a niche and expertise. You could be a journeyman project manager who doesn't care what he's working for as long as it is generally a good cause and there is pay.

What are you studying? What is important to you at a basic level when it comes to expectations of your life? What kind of stuff are you good at and what are you less good at? Development is everywhere.

Ultimately, almost any field is useful in international development. I do not believe it will continue forever in the manner that it is now, so bear the future in mind. So, if you want to do international dev because of travel, be advised that the current world has shown a lot of people that they think they can do a lot more online than they used to. Personally, this is my nightmare: I don't meet the people I'm working with. I'm missing important social queues over videos, and there aren't the traditional coffee breaks where I get the *real* info people don't dare say during the negotiations. Sometimes I still get stuff by whatsapp after the official zoom, but in some countries it is very difficult to know what your partners actually want.

There is one thing that most countries relevant to the development sector do not need: untrained labour. There are loads of people. What's missing could be money, know-how and equipment, as well as advanced understanding of policy, in all areas of work.

Now, if you want to work in international development, it is very helpful to be, well, international. Have truly intercultural experiences that are respectful. Learn to meet and talk to anyone from anywhere. Travel as much as possible once it is allowed again. Become an expert on a region. Learn languages (not just one!). If you were in Europe I'd advise you to try the European Voluntary Service (if it still exists?), I think an equivalent might be the Peace Corps but I don't know them very well. The basic idea is that you dedicate a year or two to living literally on pocket money, supporting projects of all sorts - I'm sure you can express an interest on a toppic and region - at the base level.

At college, there might be some form of fundraising/charity group. Join one, even if it's not international enough in flavour. Join the international diplomatic/war game groups where yuo can pretend to be a representative from a nation and get a first taste of diplomatic procedure and strategic thinking. It's a lot of fun!

All skills are transferable. Get certified in Project Management. The more certifications you do in PM, the better. Or look into Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning certificates. Conflict resolution. Human Resources and management/leadership. Social Work. Policy Development/analysis. Accounting. Negotiations (!) and mediation. Facilitation/leading of meetings. Law, international law, human rights law, environmental law. If law-focused, find relevant mock courts to participate in. It's funny to joke about, but good lawyers are like gold. Communications and (social) media, including associated software from photo and video editing to webdesign and social media analytics. Any type of engineering is essentially always welcome. Statistics and analytics. Conflict survival training (it's also a lot of fun). Driving 4x4 vehicles in difficult terrain. Logistics experts are among the first in any crisis zone. First aid and rescue. Psychosocial support and ""first aid"". Grant writing, even if it can be torturously boring. same with reporting.

Understand that dev is a hypercompetitive environment even at grassroots level. Get experience at any cost even as a volunteer. Consider internships in international organisations, though it may be a bit early, and look into the various young professional programmes on offer from the UN, World Bank, etc. Later you may qualify for the UN voluntary proramme which is actually ""paid"". Do a study abroad program with your college. Do not stop studying until you have at least a master's, consider getting a second. One option is to do a diploma or masters abroad. Look at international thematic programmes that give you a wide set of knowledge and skills, or a very specific one. From my Eurocentric experience and the people I have met in my field, you might enjoy Venice's [European Masters in Human Rights and Democratisation](https://gchumanrights.org/education/regional-programmes/ema/about.html), the [CIFE's international programme](https://www.cife.eu/en/3/introduction_62-1)s in France, Italy, Turkey, Tunisia, the UK, Germany and more.  A bachelor simply won't cut it unless you have already made a name for yourself. Take your studies seriously, they do matter sufficiently for it to be an issue if you have to justify poor results and needing longer than others; every interview I have ever had pointed at the length of my studies and gaps in my CV, ironically (considering my advice) caused by my poor studying ethic. I am not a gifted academic, which I would say is easily most important, but I do well with people.

It is also possible to work in international development only some of the time. If you are an expert on national or state educational policy, you can be brought in as a temporary consultant to work on a specific project. And you can contribute towards a better world from outside the international development bubble. A lot of international cooperation exists outside that realm, it can be about exchanging expertise between countries, whether it is with developing nations or not. There are amazing social enterprises ( /r/socialentrepreneur is kinda dead sadly) but I don't really know much about it. You can work as a designer for organisations' publications, while also having more regular clients. You can work in wind energy, surely at least one of the new boom industries that hopefully provides some benefit to the world.

There, I hope I could help you a bit, even if I know nothing about organisations in LA :)",True,False,False,,,,0,1601629156,,1601629538,0,{},g7dtt1l,False,t3_j3pwnt,False,False,t3_j3pwnt,/r/InternationalDev/comments/j3pwnt/how_can_an_18_year_old_possibly_get_started_with/g7dtt1l/,False,,1613818734,12,True,False,InternationalDev,t5_2wm61,r/InternationalDev,public,,1,[],

[This](https://vindinfo.dk/kort.aspx), to get to [170gCO2/kWh](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/overview-of-the-electricity-production-2/assessment-4). 

Remember the Sweden graph? 60TWh/y by 8 million people? [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark#/media/File:Wind_in_Denmark_1977_2011_large.png) is roughly the same number of people getting 10TWh/year. Still favoring the ""constant dripping"" approach ?     

And remember this is the best in the world in terms of renewable (save hydro and geoth in Iceland and Norway), so the plan is for everybody to do (with solar, wind and a couple others) even better and faster than the world champion?    
Oh and they're not planing of breaching 100g/kWh any time soon: [Figur 4](https://energinet.dk/-/media/FDA218FD05A84F8593B7376E6AD2FA89.pdf). Almost as if reaching 40-50% intermittent renewable lead to technological limitations that ""prolongation models"" didn't take into account.     

In the old days, nuclear was the fancy new stuff, making all sort of promises, like ""don't bother about the waste it'll al be recycle"", and ""electricity too cheap to meter"". We deserve to make fun of those silly promises today. Except we are following the promises of today's fancy new tech, but if those fail, it is the one and only climate we've got that is at stake.    


Look at California, so many good indicators ([Figure 2a](https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2017/ghg_inventory_trends_00-17.pdf)), so much renewable (Figure 10), but you know what indicator you will never see mentioned? you will find [data sites](http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/Emissions.aspx) with a plethora of optimistic data, but I challenge to to find there: CO2/Wh evolution over the period, because that certainly doesn't fit the narrative! look at Figure 9: sure the overall carbon content decreases, thanks to ... cleaner imports! In-State remains flat! And yet some [cheer](https://grist.org/article/californias-carbon-emissions-are-back-to-90s-levels-it-can-be-done-people/): ""The biggest reductions came from the electric power sector, where an increase in wind and solar energy has been displacing fossil fuels"". See what I mean when I say we favour good intentions and good conscience rather than objective indicators of reducing carbon content of electricity? (note that, in the case of California (probably to be seen in Germany too), the objective of reducing emissions is somewhat acheived, as increased prices lead to reduced consumption, so long for being cheap; personaly I don't care as long as emissions decrease (I even see the low price of French electricity as a bad thing), but that certainly wasn't the initial strategy)      






In one case,      
&gt; there's no telling whether that'll happen      

again.  


In the other,   

&gt; there's no telling whether that'll happen      

at all.   

Again, is a time of crisis the best time to bet on acheiving something that has never been done before. With the best argument being ""it's cheaper"" ? Our kids will be so glad of all the money we'll have saved.     


Yes, debacle, but why?! Why was something possible years ago here; is still possible in other countries (S Korea, Russia, China)? Isn't it a worthy question to ak before throwing the baby with the bath water? Let's dig into that! Isn't replicating what we knew a surer bet than trying something new (would you gave up on wind if for some reason todays wind was more expensive than yesterdays?)? Except we won't like what we'll learn: when/ where nucelar project are long term political strong plans, the industry and the investors can get behind. Especially regarding costs, what has changed here is the political uncertainty, this lead to a completely **artificail** increase of the cost of money. Because, for political reasons, any nuclear projet can be cancelled on the whim of a politician/governemnt trying to score some votes, becasue of those, compeltely artificail, risks, borrowing money over such long period becomes prohibitive. Case in Hinkley Point, with an [ROE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station#Return_on_equity) of the order of 20% and more! If tomorrow the anti-wind people had as much sway as the anti nuclear movement, you can bet that wind farm financing would get the same treatment.   



You seem to be willing to put some time into the quesiton.   
Here is a view of what I think the future hold for us, please let me know what you htink and correct me.      
this is a [proposal](https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/how-the-system-works/diablo-canyon-power-plant/joint-proposal.page?WT.mc_id=Vanity_jointproposal) by Friends of the Earth and other very intelligent people to close the two reactors of the Diablo Canyon power plant in the US.    

It's only about 20 pages long and the way I understand it is:      
""You can keep your plants until 2024-25, but you must:      
- have 2000GWh worth of efficiency by 2025.     
- have 2000GWh worth of renewable by 2025-30.     
- have 55% of something else in your total mix by 2031 (six years after the plants are shut down).""    
Seems reasonable enough, right? They are not asking to close everything tomorrow.      
Please, read it, have it read by other, and ask them how realistic and convincing they find it.    
Than also ask them how much the two reactors are producing. Surely it must be somewhere in the report, right?    
Until you realize that nowhere in the entire document is it mentioned that the two reactors they want to replace produce [8000GWh](http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/DIABLO%20CANYON-1) [each](http://www.world-nuclear.org/reactor/default.aspx/DIABLO%20CANYON-2).       
Am I wrong to think that we shouldnt bett our carbon emissions on 2+2+something will coome up = 16 ? Just so you know, it [worked](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-California-commission-approves-Diablo-Canyon-closure-1201187.html). Wouldn't you call that a ""risky undertaking"" ?     
They're actually slowly [reviewing](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/proposed-bill-include-large-hydro-nuclear-power-californias-rps/570919/) their dogma, only after having deciding the closure, of course.     
This is for me what is awaiting us: we will strongly hope to acheive very low carbon electricity, we will somewhat have cleaner (say 200 rather than 400) and call it a victory, we'll tell our kids we did everything we could, and they'll look at the early decomissioning plants, knowing we knew better.    
Paved with [good intentions](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/11/archives/coal-power-gets-assist-from-youth.html).    


Germany is putting [520B€](https://www.thegwpf.com/german-energiewende-to-cost-staggering-e520-billion-by-2025-first-full-cost-study-finds/) to reach at best [60%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energiewende) renewable in 2050. With the [40%](http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/) remaining, if by then they aren't below 100-80gCO2/kWh (remember, France is at 58 today), kids will do the math at school of what 52 brand nuw nukes at 10B€ a pop would have meant for climate (let alone not closing the ones aleady there).

Jesus wept.

Given the above, you think you can comment sensibly on any of this?

Services generally make up around 80% of the UK economy, of course they do, because services include anything that doesn't produce a tangible good. So services include (and I'll quote from [here](https://www.britannica.com/topic/service-industry) so you don't think I'm making shit up) ..*""communications, wholesale and retail trade, all professional services such as engineering, computer software development, and medicine, nonprofit economic activity, all consumer services, and all government services, including defense and administration of justice.""*. 

Financial services is a small segment of that (see [here](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06193/), it contributed £132 billion to the UK economy, or 6.9% of output, that's about the same as construction, or a third of that of manufacturing). It's important, it's not 80% of the UK economy, it's not even 8%.

Yes, London is one of the most important financial services sectors in the world, it'll continue to be, but it's a small part of the UK economy (and as an aside, that financial services sector includes things like retail banking, mortgage lending and insurance..).

&gt;with each deal the pound drops further

Erm.. Quite literally the opposite (after the WA the pound rose to something like 1.18 again..), it has subsequently dropped because we are back to the 'will they won't they' on an FTA..

&gt;The laws the UK MEP's debated, help write and democratically voted into law?

At the EU level, with UK governments and the UK electorate unable to take action on them after the fact or at the time, because you know, the EU is a group of lots of countries? I'm not saying the UK didn't have input, I'm saying that it now doesn't need to ask.

&gt;because we're leaving so why bother to listen to us, we've shown we can't be trusted regarding international law and we have forced the EU to spend a lot of time and effort in pointless ""negotiations"" due to bad faith on our part.

We weren't leaving for large portions of that period and again, having to push for years for a tax change like this is a problem in and of itself, the EU being able to say 'no' (or to bin the VAT cuts on Solar for example..) is shite. I'd rather the UK be able to act and then I can hold my MP responsible.

&gt;How many times did Farage attend meetings of the fishy committee? Maybe if he had actually turned up to do his job these areas would have full protection. You can't claim ""we don't get what we want"" when the people responsible for negotiating it don't bother to do their job

Farage is a tit.. I'm not sure how it's relevant. Oh and as an aside the fisheries committee is stymied by the way the EU operates anyway, the whole approach is farcical. Get a scientific estimate on what is a safe catch and then allocate quotas above that? Neither the Fisheries committee, nor UK MEP's, not the UK government could change the rules to prevent UK protected waters from being fished (and overfished..). Now the UK can.

&gt;Belarus have annulled the election result and are having free and fair elections? No they haven't

""OK sure""

""THATS IT WE'VE RENEGOTIATED THE DEAL!!!""

Moving to a previously agreed price isn't the same as renegotiating, that would have required starting from scratch. If you look at Johnson's deal it's the same as May's original deal before the DUP shot it down. It was sold to the UK electorate as a renegotiation by the Tories so they could win and then push it through WM despite its flaws.

Only now the Tories want to renege on it because it turns out it's shite (and imo always has been) and they don't like it anymore though it's served the purpose of winning them the election.

&gt;Tory majority changes how the PM and HMG conduct the negotiations

I actually agree here, it does change how the government acts. Unfortunately it doesn't change reality

&gt;play hard ball with the EU

That's not really a thing unless you mean threaten to walk away if you don't get what you want, which was always going to happen once the time limit expired.

&gt;Which seems yet to be noticed in the EU who is trying the same spiel they used on May.

The EU has a consistent position, WM has no idea what kind of brexit it wants I mean fuck it signed the WA and now suddenly it doesn't like the WA? In that case don't sign it lol

Azerbaijan's policy with regards to Armenians:

Azerbaijan is the only country in the world which bans entry of people based on their surname/ethnicity/heritage, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality:

&gt; U.S. citizens of Armenian ancestry – or even those with Armenian last names – have had their visa applications denied by the Government of Azerbaijan on the grounds that their safety cannot be guaranteed.

**Is there a neutral narrative of the conflict?**

Recently the UK based Conciliation Resources released a documentary jointly produced by Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists. This is agreed to be the most neutral account of the conflict ever made, you can watch it online here: https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/film-parts-circle-history-karabakh-conflict

Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War by Thomas de Waal is agreed to be the best book on the conflict: https://nyupress.org/9780814760321/black-garden/

**Is there a peace plan?**

Azerbaijan and the Armenian side have agreed in principle to the settlement process mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chaired by the US, Russia and France with a mandate from the UN, which since 2009 has consisted of the following proposal:

 &gt; The ministers of the US, France, and Russia presented a preliminary version of the Basic Principles for a settlement to Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2007 in Madrid.

 &gt; The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of Peoples.

 &gt; The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

 &gt;- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

 &gt;- an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

 &gt;- a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

 &gt;- future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

 &gt;- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

 &gt;- international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

 &gt; The endorsement of these Basic Principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan will allow the drafting of a comprehensive settlement to ensure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for Armenia and Azerbaijan and the broader region.

However there has been no meaningful progress in the negotiations, meanwhile the mediating group focusing on containing the conflict proposed to *harden the ceasefire regime* following the 2016 April ""four day war"" as well as following the [Armenian revolution of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Armenian_revolution) made a proposal to the sides to *prepare the populations for peace*. 

[Thomas de Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Waal):

&gt; Russia, the US and the EU have enough tools to contain both sides, but they have neither the time, nor the energy, nor the desire to try to force Armenia and Azerbaijan to conclude peace, let alone send peacekeepers who will have to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

[Sergey Markedonov (Carnegie Moscow Center)](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/experts/1196):

&gt; Russia is well aware that the search for compromises is the business of the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. They are not ready for this, but no one will do this work for them.

**What disinformation is prevalent about this conflict?**

One of the most entrenched disinformations is that pertaining to the nature of the UN Security Council resolutions on the conflict. 

The UN Security Council resolutions concern with and recognise the invasions and occupations of the [*surrounding territories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_Nagorno-Karabakh#:~:text=The%20Armenian%2Dcontrolled%20territories%20surrounding,of%20Artsakh%20supported%20by%20Armenia.) of Nagorno-Karabakh carried out by local Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh.

The UN Security Council resolutions 

1. do NOT recognise Republic of Armenia having invaded or occupied any territories, 

2. do NOT recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as occupied or invaded territory,

3. do NOT demand Republic of Armenia to withdraw forces from any territories,

4. do NOT demand any forces to be withdrawn from Nagorno-Karabakh.

\- Sure I know there is some disadvantages to those setups (3322 and 4222) and you pointed some of them. I started using those setups only when I have SG in starting hand or a Defector HL. But at the end, I concluded that the advantages worth the risks most of the time, including the risk of a SG HL.  That said, there are still situations where I think 442 is the right setup.

\- I want to point this about one of the thing you said: if Soviet do have EU scoring in hand on turn 1, the fact they need to HL it to avoid domination (because with a 3322 setup US is almost sure to have EU dom at end of AR1) mean they cannot use their other good HL card (like VR, Nasser or other). This is a great thing for US!

\- This setup is not just useful with a low op hand as you pretend. As a general principle, getting more BG and more access is better than over-protection of BG in early war and this is true even for Italy most of the time.  So even with an high ops hand, I will still prefer to take one more BG in Asia or ME, or present a treat in Africa or SA than double overprotect Italy. After all, USSR have only 50% chances of getting SG and you could have Defector to counter it.  So in my book, the Italy vulnerability worth the risk most of the time.

\- It's painful that you bring my games against Stryker, especially the game 3. On the game 3 setup, I did not look enough my hand before setting up at 3322.  This was a big mistake.  With no good HL, i was forced to HL Special Relationship.  Having think a little more, I would have setup at 4222 and got EU domination on the HL.  His EU HL would have worth me 5 vp .  I don't do this mistake anymore and now use 4222 in the rares occasions where I don't have a better HL than SR (this is like a mini-MP, getting EU dom on setup is always great). I still ressent this mistake vs Stryker, thinking I would have won this game with the 4222 setup...

\- EDIT: I could add other counterpoints to what you said about the vulnerability to DeGaule and Suez of the 3322 setup. First, the better protection you got from the Decol/Destal HL+Duck into France combo more than compensate this vulnerability in my opinion.  Also, this vulnerability to Suez or DeGaule HL on turn 1 is not a big thing most of the time: you can normally repair France anyway, except for a Degaule+Duck combo.  But the 442 setup fall to this Degaule + Duck combo the same way so once again there is no big difference at the end.

\- 2nd EDIT: What you said about the weakness of a US coup in Italy (in the scenario where Soviet empty Italy with SG before taking Italy on AR1 by influence placement) is totally true.  As US I will never coup Italy in that scenario if Soviet put 3+ influence there: better to just give up on Europe and play elsewhere.  I could consider a coup only if USSR put only 2 there. But as we both know, a Soviet SG HL will result in USSR taking a 3rd European battleground most of the time against any US setup anyway.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601642330,,1601654382,0,{},g7e9tdo,False,t3_j2pt9q,False,True,t1_g7d94r0,/r/twilightstruggle/comments/j2pt9q/thoughts_on_us_opening_setups/g7e9tdo/,False,,1613826354,2,True,False,twilightstruggle,t5_2tq49,r/twilightstruggle,public,,0,[],

McInnes himself has ties to the racist right and has contributed to hate sites like VDare.com and American Renaissance, both of which publish the work of white supremacists and so-called “race realists.” He even used Taki’s Magazine — a far-right publication whose contributors include Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor — to announce the founding of the Proud Boys. McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term “alt-right” while espousing some of its central tenets. For example, McInnes has himself said it is fair to call him Islamophobic.


""Muslims have a problem with inbreeding. They tend to marry their first cousins…and that is a major problem here because when you have mentally damaged inbreds — which not all Muslims are, but a disproportionate number are — and you have a hate book called the Koran…you end up with a perfect recipe for mass murder."" — Gavin McInnes, Get Off My Lawn, April 24, 2018

“I am not afraid to speak out about the atrocities that whites and people of European descent face not only here in this country but in Western nations across the world. The war against whites, and Europeans and Western society is very real and it’s time we all started talking about it and stopped worrying about political correctness and optics.”

Except for maybe an airport or Times Square, no McDonalds in the US costs nearly this much. I wanna say it is still around $6 for a value meal in the Midwest or South.

So I would chalk this up to probably 4 things:

1. Commercial rents in DK are probably lower than those in the US, at least in comparably dense areas. I would guess that a McDonalds in Manhattan, is going to be paying triple per square foot vs one in Central CPH.

2. Big Macs have always kind of been a loss leader at DK McDonalds and are artificially cheap compared to the rest of the menu.

3. A full time US worker gets healthcare and some of their income tax paid by their employer (in the form of payroll tax), so nominal wage is lower than true cost to employer.

It was actually more so like Judas Priest &amp; Iron Maiden &gt; Accept &gt; Helloween, and at first the bands were speed metal and only really later on developed into EU power metal. If you compare Walls of Jericho with Keeper of the Seven Keys you can note the differences.

&gt; What bands led up to the creation of USPM?

USPM draws from similar influences of EUPM, all the early bands loved their NWOBHM. If you check out Ride Into Glory's [guide to US Power Metal](https://rideintoglory.com/marcos-guide-to-uspm/) you can see some of the history behind the scene.

&gt; Howie Bentley of 90s USPM flagbearers Cauldron Born agrees that the UK really laid the foundation for American bands as he says “…all of these USPM bands were influenced by three bands, when you get right down to it: Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.” Howie elaborates a bit further and mentions that “fans now can shit-talk them all they want, but bands like Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer had something new and fresh going on at the time. I listened to those bands and I am sure some of the songwriters for the other USPM bands listened to them, too. It’s why the bands that were still operating in traditional metal territory in USA sounded a little harder-edged than the bands across the pond.”

Aí você pode dizer que tem mais torcedores do Grêmio, maior goleada, ou sei lá o quê. Por isso a pergunta, mas não sei se tu não prestou atenção ou eu que não expliquei direito.

De qualquer forma, o u/mashinceres84 foi bem pertinente ao falar que isso é mais papo de boteco, não é um post no reddit que vai definir quem é maior (essa nem é a minha intenção, era só ter uma discussão na boa).

1.

Generally speaking (and assuming it's Europe), how common was it for people of color, especially black people to travel there?

2. How were queer people treated historically? Was say, the concept of more than two genders particularly common?

3. What are some commonly-made misconceptions when it comes to combat (e.g. 'swords don't make a ringing sound coming out of their sheath)?

4. Were people as obsessed with cats as we are today? Was there a historical Twitter/Instagram version of showing people cat pictures?

5. How was necromancy in Chinese culture (mainland and diaspora) depicted?

&gt; EPA. Armenia&amp;#039;s foreign ministry has said it &amp;quot;Stands ready to engage&amp;quot; with France, Russia and the US on halting six days of fighting with its neighbour Azerbaijan.

&gt; In the latest fighting, Azerbaijan forces said they had made further advances, but accused Armenia of artillery attacks on four villages, causing civilian casualties.

&gt; Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev has so far rejected talks, and his main ally, Turkey, has said a lasting ceasefire depends on &amp;quot;Armenians&amp;#039; withdrawal from every span of Azerbaijani territory&amp;quot;.

Their system is to invest heavily in very young top talents, develop them as quickly as possible to strengthen their squad and help compete with Bayern domestically and internationally in order to close the financial gulf between them and Bayern as quickly as possible (impossible but they are trying at least).

“My study's literal purpose was to address that even Black families of a higher socioeconomic status still show patterns of increased heart disease. Black Families of a higher socioeconomic status are no longer being forced into leading an unhealthy lifestyle by being poor... So you can't continue to use that excuse. If they are still eating incredibly unhealthy despite not being poor, then they are doing so by personal choice and you can't pin that on racism.”

This ignores once again what I’m trying to get across, one we don’t all eat unhealthy or even our food is unhealthy, black people across the Deep South specifically those who eat creole staples aren’t unhealthy gumbo, crawfish, jambalaya. What we’re referring to specifically is the poor food choices, that usually come from fast food that includes primarily fried foods which is a result of poverty. 

Your study showcased that even when we went above poor food quality this still exist which is why I mentioned the multiple factors that lead to heart disease, high blood pressure=stressful lifestyle why are their lives stressful? Racism is a big factor in that motivation, high cholesterol? That can definitely be in relation to poor food staples, obesity usually is in relation to parental upbringing if your parents are unhealthy you’re imprinted by their choices and most likely will do the same, healthy eating comes from knowledge, the lack of which lies in the poverty they escape from. The poverty that derives from slavery, my point is it’s obvious racism plays a huge part in the current poor health of the black community both with evaluation and treatment, plus the fact these problems exist in the first place. 

If you want to go genes you would need to study African diaspora populations globally to see if it’s a racial trait.

“That's literally impossible to do with African-Americans. American black people experienced their own little stint of Eugenics, when slave-owners selectively bred their slaves. You will find things in American Blacks that other black people in the world just don't have, because ""natural selection"" was tampered with and tailored to the American Slave-owner's desires. On top of the fact that America is the literal melting pot of the world, and our collective gene pool is totally different from everyone else's.”

This is literally the dumbest shit I have ever read, the triangle trade included all of South America and the Caribbean, black peoples are 20 to 30% mixed with European DNA. We’re not some unique special eugenics experiment, the same thing we endured black people in Brazil faced and the Carribean with even more admixture. Brazil is extremely diverse with a mixed population also, this ignores so much basic historical knowledge of how slavery was carried out. If this was true that would validate my entire point, black people would be like pugs created with genetic defects and horrible health  on purpose to look cute which would still put white people at fault. Thanks for proving my point!!

""That's partially true, but not fully applicable in this case. Even when you control socioeconomic factors... American Black people are still at a greater risk. It's really not a case of systemic racism forcing black people in general to have lesser health; It's just a part of how their genetics differ. Also cultural food preferences could play a part too.

The interest is real.  As reported by L’Equipe, there are contacts between PSG and OL regarding Houssem Aouar.  At the moment, it's just a matter of exchanges.  There is nothing formal, but the capital club are thinking well about the 22-year-old French midfielder.  This track is founded.  This is what RMC Sport explained on April 24.  Within the PSG, Aouar has several supporters.  But Arsenal and Juventus Turin represent significant competition.

 Aulas would like to quickly settle the issue of departures

 The Gunners have been on the move for long weeks, while Juve decided to look into this issue at the end of the transfer window.  While European clubs have until October 5 to carry out operations, Jean-Michel Aulas has repeatedly reiterated his intention to complete the departures by Friday evening at the latest.

You know, all the clubs can not give us commitments on the financial amounts "", he detailed.

 The three clubs mentioned by Aulas are Arsenal, Juve and PSG.  Valued at around 50 million euros by its leaders, Aouar made an impression in the last Final 8 of the Champions League by delivering excellent performances.

The ninth round of negotiations on a future partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom took place this week in Brussels.

Across the 11 negotiating tables, with discussions held in a constructive and respectful atmosphere, we noted:

 * **points of convergence**, most of which had already been recorded in previous rounds, in particular on some aspects of trade in goods, services and investment, civil nuclear cooperation, and participation in Union programmes;
 * **positive new developments** on some topics such as aviation safety, social security coordination, and the respect of fundamental rights and individual freedoms, which are a pre-condition for our future police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters;
 * **a lack of progress** on some important topics like the protection of personal data, climate change commitments or carbon pricing;
 * **as well as persistent serious divergences** on matters of major importance for the European Union.

We recall once again that any agreement on an economic partnership with the United Kingdom requires:

1. **Solid, long-term guarantees of open and fair competition**. Our new economic partnership must be underpinned by clear rules. These rules must be operational and credible. That requires effective enforcement mechanisms, in particular on **State aid**, and a commitment towards **non-regression from social, fiscal, environmental and climate standards**. This is possible while fully respecting the regulatory autonomy and sovereignty of both parties.
2. **An efficient governance framework**, based on a comprehensive agreement, **with robust enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms, as well as effective remedies**. This is naturally even more important following the UK government's introduction of the « Internal Market Bill», which breaches its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland.
3. **A stable, sustainable and long-term agreement on fisheries**, enabling the United Kingdom to further develop its fishing opportunities, while ensuring the sustainable use of resources and protecting the activities of European fishermen and women.

To reach an agreement, these divergences must necessarily be overcome over the next weeks.

We will continue to maintain a calm and respectful attitude, and we will remain united and determined until the end of these negotiations.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601653568,,False,0,{},g7etvry,True,t3_j3wfy8,False,False,t3_j3wfy8,/r/brexit/comments/j3wfy8/michel_barnier_we_will_continue_to_maintain_a/g7etvry/,False,,1613835873,13,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,,0,[],True

The average Swede tax burden is 44.1%. With progressive tax rates most Swedes will pay less than that.

United States|26.00%|$15,470|37.80%|$22,491|325.9|$19,390.60|$59,501

If we're looking just at healthcare, it's even more ridiculous. Americans pay far more in taxes towards public health. 

With government in the US covering [64.3% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ([$11,072 as of 2019](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf)) that's $7,119 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Norway at [$5,673](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). Sweden is $4,928. The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $113,786 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. 

&gt;The doctors will skip, make mistakes and refer you back and forth

The US has higher rates of medical and lab errors than its peers.  

https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/

&gt;we have no choice of healthcare

Sweden most definitely has private healthcare options. 

&gt;The US healthcare system while expensive is the best healthcare system in the world

Based on what? 

[US Healthcare ranked 29th by Lancet HAQ Index](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(18\)30994-2/fulltext)

[11th (of 11) by Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror-wall-2014-update-how-us-health-care-system?redirect_source=/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror)

[37th by the World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000)

&gt;they are 10 years ahead of every other country in terms of diagnosis and treatment

We have worse outcomes on average. 

&gt;The USA is the No.1 publisher of medical research and the rest of the world uses the PUBMED: NLM NIH database of studies.

Five percent of US healthcare spending goes towards biomedical research, the same percentage as the rest of the world. That shows that research is really just a function of spending, which raises two questions: 

1. Americans pay half a million dollars more per person for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the OECD average and countries like Canada and the UK. Should they think that's a good value to fund 23% of global research, or do you think they'd rather have that money back.

2. Even if Americans did want to ensure research didn't suffer, can you not see that it would be trivial to replace $100 billion in research funding (assuming the US somehow managed to match OECD average levels of spending) with the $2 trillion they'd be saving each year? 

&gt;All of the top 10 cancer hospitals are in America.

I love how everybody always focuses on cancer, one of the only bright spots in US healthcare. Cherry pick much? Again, if you look at outcomes across dozens of diseases, the US trails its peers. More Americans are dying of medically preventable causes than in other wealthy countries. 

&gt;The US is third in the world for wait times.

The US ranks 6th of 11 out of Commonwealth Fund countries on ER wait times on percentage served under 4 hours. 10th of 11 on getting weekend and evening care without going to the ER. 5th of 11 for countries able to make a same or next day doctors/nurse appointment when they're sick.

https://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016

Americans do better on wait times for specialists (ranking 3rd for wait times under four weeks), and surgeries (ranking 3rd for wait times under four months), but that ignores three important factors:

* Wait times in universal healthcare are based on urgency, so while you might wait for an elective hip replacement surgery you're going to get surgery for that life threatening illness quickly. 

* Nearly every universal healthcare country has strong private options and supplemental private insurance. That means that if there is a wait you're not happy about you have options that still work out significantly cheaper than US care, which is a win/win.

* [One third of US families](https://news.gallup.com/poll/269138/americans-delaying-medical-treatment-due-cost.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication) had to put off healthcare due to the cost last year. That means more Americans are waiting for care than any other wealthy country on earth.

&gt;Swedes can’t get access to the healthcare they pay huge taxes for

Far greater Americans can't access public healthcare at all despite paying far more in taxes towards healthcare. 

&gt;Any other “Disparity” you are looking at is trying to compare European countries with no more than 90 million inhabitants to America that has 350 million residents

Citation needed that makes any difference at all. 

Universal healthcare has been shown to work from populations below 100,000 to populations above 100 million. From Andorra to Japan; Iceland to Germany, with no issues in scaling. In fact the only correlation I've ever been able to find is a weak one with a minor decrease in cost per capita [as population increases](https://i.imgur.com/h6clEzr.jpg). 

&gt;and the fact that Americans tend to eat more junk food and live more unhealthy lifestyles putting them in contact with the doctor more.

Except healthcare utilization rates are roughly the same in the US as in peer countries.

We aren't receiving significantly more healthcare, due to health risk factors or anything else, we're just paying dramatically more for the care we are receiving.

&gt; YEREVAN, Armenia - Armenia said Friday it is ready to discuss a cease-fire in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where heavy fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces this week has killed dozens and left scores wounded.

&gt; The fighting is the biggest escalation in years in the decades-long dispute over the region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is controlled by local ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia.

&gt; &amp;quot;Armenia remains committed to the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,&amp;quot; the statement read.Azerbaijan&amp;#039;s president says Armenia&amp;#039;s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.

Uhm, das allemaal goed en wel en ge moogt uzelf enorm serieus nemen... maar het ging eigenlijk over de user hieronder die cap&amp;trade voorstelde op een onjuiste manier. Open een gas centrale en sluit een bruinkool centrale is helemaal niet hoe dit werkt.

&gt;Het zal daarom wel zijn dat ze een stamcelwetenschapper als minister afvaardigen zeker.

Er zitten wetenschappers in elke partij. Dat maakt ze nog niet correct over alles, maar nu je het zegt ik ben wel eens benieuwd hoe De Sutter staat tegenover homeopathie en dergelijke. Soms carrière &gt; realiteit. Jong groen heeft een tijdje een pro gmo campagne gevoerd maar is nooit door de partij dogma's gebroken:
https://vilt.be/nl/nieuws/jong-groen-verrast-met-standpunt-pro-ggos

&gt; Jonges, het GMO-debat is opgelost. U/noodelsoup heeft gezegd dat de gevaren ""overstated"" zijn, ga maar naar huis.

Niet ik, maar deze site van independent experts zegt het wel. Komt er op neer dat het enige gevaar van GMO's de patenten van bedrijven zijn. Monsanto af en toe eens terugroepen is ok, maar mochten de linkse rakkers in het europees parlement wat minder dogmatisch zijn, dan konden we het onderzoek mss een stuk terug naar onze universiteiten brengen. 

Tenzij de groene militanten terug de boel omzeep gaan stampen natuurlijk. 

https://gmoanswers.com/gmo-myths-vs-facts

&gt;De enige link tussen de twee die ik kan terugvinden is dat Van Montagu werd uitgenodigd voor een debat georganizeerd door Agalev. Als dat ""afrekenen"" is, tja.

Bekijk dan maar even, een gen in de soep. Een oude docu van canvas... die mens is letterlijk naar de us moeten vluchten. Onze grootste wetenschapper ooit waarschijnlijk, volledig in de vernieling gebracht. 

Dit had Belgie op de kaart kunnen zetten als GMO capital of the world. Look how that turned out.

&gt;Niet iedereen doet mee aan de paniekerige economische geloofsbelijdenis waar de 5g-historie een voorbeeld van is, dat klopt. Eerst onderzoeken wat de mogelijke baten en kosten zijn, dan pas beslissen.

Lmao, belgie is een land die het moet hebben van innovatie en we moeten onze bedrijven een klimaat gunnen waar ze het kunnen zijn. 5g is helemaal niet schadelijk voor de gezondheid, niks schadelijk aan. In de betogen van PVDA en Groen staat dat ze daar bezorgd om zijn... ze betrouwen dus de wetenschap niet.

https://www.gezondheidenwetenschap.be/gezondheid-in-de-media/wat-is-5g-en-is-het-schadelijk-voor-onze-gezondheid#:~:text=Wifi-stralen%20hebben%20dus%20geen,kan%20enkel%20de%20toekomst%20uitwijzen.

Stilstaan is achteruitgaan, dat is wat groen doet.

&gt;Als diensten die enkel de verbetering van subjectief welzijn van de patient tot doel hebben niet terugbetaald mogen worden dan zijn er ook heel wat dingen af te schaffen die tot de klassieke geneeskunde gerekend worden, van pijnstillers tot massages.

Komaan zeg, placebo's hebben misschien een plaats in de geneeskunde sure I guess. Maar dat kan dan zeker zonder homeopathie. Wat een non-argument. 

Mekkeren op big-pharma maar homeopathie bedrijven verdienen ook geld op de rug van goed gelovigen. En jij zou dat steunen? Slik dan een suikerpil als je een placebo wilt. 

&gt;Nee, Groen is er van overtuigd dat dat zo is. Maar je hebt wel vaker problemen met het werkwoord liegen.

Groen liegt wel degelijk, ze gebruikt het ipcc als wetenschappelijke bron van de wetenschap omtrent klimaat verandering:

https://www.groen.be/eu_klimaatwet_minstens_55_minder_co2_uitstoot_tegen_2030_nodig

Ze weigeren wel open te zijn over het duidelijkste standpunt van het ipcc. Namelijk dat kernenergie de toekomst is, en niet het verleden:

Rudolf didn't like this and raised an army to put him into his place. And he would lose if PO2 didn't get betrayed and killed in the decisive battle.

Here is one **Vintage Omega Constellation from 1971.**

Ref: 368.0852/168.059

Cal:1011

So, here we dont have just watch. It is Vintage Omega Constellation **with all papers, hang tag and box that comes with it**. So this set isnt something you will find easy.

Also, not just it is working as need. Watch is **serviced 04.2020**. and works very nice.I am selling it just because I have searched something else and am not fan of square watches…in any other case this will stay in collection. But as I am smallwatch entuijast, I need to sell something to buy something else so this is going out of my box.

Watch is used, there are normal signs of use. So it is not NOS or Mint, it is used. Also it wasnt working for long time so when watchmaker serviced it was very big problem to open it..and you can see marks on screws.

case size is apx 40x33 (without crown ofc)

**Everything is genuine**….watch, bracelet, parts inside, glass, bracelet, crown….So this is something for collection that I am unlucky not to keep it.

Bracelet is 1155/146 and it is for apx 18-19cm wrist size. And there are microholes for fine size adjustment.

Nice set, isnt it;)

This type of common ownership arrangement is not unique to the NWSL.   One thing it does mean is that for US national team players it can be more lucrative to play in the US - or put another way - if a foreign team wants to sign a US national team player it will presumably cost them at least as much as the player could get playing on a NWSL team.

Now, the reality is that for star Euro women players - they can probably make more playing on their own teams in Europe where they have name recognition and marketing potential for endorsement dollars.  In the US, that marketing potential already exists with a decent number of US players whose names are generally well known in the US market.  And, the US women’s girl’s soccer market is already bigger than anywhere else.

Earl of Sherborne](https://www.reddit.com/user/jas1066) about the other place getting its say on the matter. Even then, however, there's nothing wrong with bringing up policy in this chamber so I see little wrong with at least debating the issue.

Of all the states in Europe which possess or possessed colonial empires, it is only the English who so willfully wish to keep a remnant of theirs in their commemorative awards. This is not found in Spain, Portugal, or even France; it simply doesn't factor into things. Even other Commonwealth states have long moved past the grant of OBEs for one reason or the other. 

There is little value in carrying this record forward. The Empire was by and large a genocidal and tyrannical endeavour. Many people, myself included, have simply refused to take these honours because of this association; I want no part in any imperial project. 

This is not an issue for the washed up politicians of today such as myself either. People including political titans, such as John Hume, and some of the greatest literary minds, such as Benjamin Zephaniah, have simply refused to take such honours. Therefore I reject the notion that there is no harm in retaining the name; when one's honorary civilian order is alienating many worthy people then perhaps it's time to move on from imperial delusions. In theory, such an award would be able to recognise the broad talents across society but unfortunately it's just not able to do that with such a name right now.

We are already IN the future. This isn't the referendum period anymore, that is also what has changed. The effects of Brexit have become stark reality. Which is another reason why the moon-is-cheese arguers have dissappeared. You can no longer do off those counter-arguments as 'Project Fear' or what-ifs-maybes. The number of scenarios that you can wave off as ' Project Fear' have reduced significantly. There *is* chaos, there *is* economic damage, it *is* a shitshow.

This isn't 1890 anymore, it's now 1969. We know the moon isn't made up of cheese. In 1890 you could have a valid discussion on that, because no one knew the actual composition. We are 2020 and we know Brexit is a shitshow where nothing good will come out.

* yes, battery should get better. If you haven't yet, make sure to enable the ""Overlay"" mode which is not only faster but more battery efficient than the default operation. You can also control which bubbles show on the always-on-screen (i.e. ambient mode), the less pixels lit the less power this AOD needs. See [Watch face ambient mode: bubble visibility and color](https://bubble.dynalogix.eu/ambient-mode-visibility-color/)
* I think probably the best place for sharing themes would be this reddit stream. I could pick them up from here and make a section for them in the app's webpage. Eventually I could create an online gallery where users could post, but so far the sharing feature hasn't been picked up by many. I found this free image hosting ideal for sharing RichImages without altering the crucial metadata.
* [This post](https://bubble.dynalogix.eu/weather-bubbles/) shows you how the weather bubbles look in both active and ambient modes, but you can add the watch face complication for any Wear OS weather app, I list a few in [this post](https://bubble.dynalogix.eu/weather/)
* Regarding your battery life requirements, I have just received my new TicWatch Pro 3 watch and I must say this sets a new baseline for Wear OS performance and battery life. I have waited 3 years to find an upgrade to the Huawei Watch 2 which I have been using until now. With the TWP3 I am getting 2 days battery with all watch features enabled (continuous heart rate and blood oxygen metering, sleep tracking, automatic exercise tracking, gestures, tilt-to-wake etc) using Bubble Cloud's own always-on-display. When I turn off always-on-display the watch still shows the time and vital data on its LCD screen, and the battery lasts for half a week this way. I hope every future watch will be compared to this one bringing a new era to Wear OS.

In fact, by that same argument I would give CoreJJ less credit considering he's playing in NA if that's the angle you're trying to go with.

Also you're just wrong, Kaiser didn't just have ""several good weeks"" he was the best support throughout the summer season and was also very good in spring split, more impressive when you consider he's a rookie. I would say Kaiser played better than CoreJJ this split, when he was by far the best support player in the league and was consistently good even in playoffs when MAD didn't look as great, the same can't be said about CoreJJ in playoffs. Does this mean I think he's better than CoreJJ? Obviously not because there is other metrics than just performance off one split, but I do think he was the best performing player outside of Caps this split.

It's objectively true that MAD underperformed, that is visible even on an individual basis where they didn't play as well, a lot of mechanical errors that were out of character. Obviously a team of rookies that has such a small amount of games on stage this year did not look as good as they did online, which is to be expected. If you look at their gameplay and think they played in the same form as they did during the split then I'm not sure what game you're watching, which is quite literally the definition of  underperforming.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601658052,,1601658553,0,{},g7f2si9,False,t3_j3qiib,False,True,t1_g7ex4uk,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/j3qiib/corejj_rank1_on_the_super_server_among_the_worlds/g7f2si9/,False,,1613840097,2,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,,0,[],

You don't need to shell out 30-40$ every month for premium subscription and all that stuff. And the only thing I hate is even when they rob your wallet in broad daylight still; fanboys are fanboys no matter what. They just go bat-sh*t crazy on any new product for which you can buy a car lol:).
 See..., owning an Apple product is not a crime, (it's not my money afterall) but for someone who doesn't come from a rich family; my stomach burns when someone spends a 1000$ on a phone (in my country it's like a 100,000). 

Regardless; you're right 3-3.5 years + is the maximum amount of time you should own a single phone by then it would almost be half- obsolete; I bought a Xiaomi (around 180$) and trust me even after 3+ years it didn't lose it's shine, though it's a entry- level phone it works good and hasn't slowed or hanged up even once.. and the immense value for money is what I love. The Mi10 Ultra / Mi10T (coming in a few days) is probably available in the UK. I heard their sales in European markets are going well they even launched a E-scooter lol!

Do you think that martial manufacturing should just be ignored of it's being conducted in a built up area? Or are you so devoted to your Germany did nothing wrong spiel that you just don't care about your lie? 

Is it so hard to grasp that:

Bombing built up population centers is wrong =/= nazis did nothing wrong????  
Are you this fucking dense?

...how the fuck are the nazis NOT evil, when they performed the exact same actions i am condemning right here?

""eVErYThiNG iS mOraLly jUsT wHeN U fIGhT hITleR!!!!"" took your sanity, that you cannot comprehend basic logic?

&amp;#x200B;

Nazis bombing civilian population centers = evil nazis.  
US &amp; UK bombing civilian population centers = evil US &amp; UK  
Is this honestly that fucking hard to comprehend???????????????????

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Vae victis"" is a concept that hasn't been relevant since before the first world war. Tellingly it is only used today by pretentious children and lost cause apologists like yourself who seek to justify their morally disgusting stances through use of the schoolyard excuse ""b-but everyone else is just as bad."" 

I will believe it the second the US starts teching schoolkids about how it created and funded a nazi pedophile colony to have a torture camp during operation condor.  
Or when i hear about the years of lead due to operation gladio.  
Or when i hear about how the US is protecting greek civilians from evil russia, by assassinating greek tech personel who discovered US wiretaps.

Not everyone is equally bad.

However the victors will make cosmetic alterations to history - or history that gets taught - to make themselves look better.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes the US bombed Switzerland during the war for the same reason the Germans did: night bombing before GPS tracking systems was a hit or miss affair at the best of times. 

There is a slight problem.

The instance i brought up was a DAYTIME RAID, with 50 aircraft. Not a slight error made during the night, as ""GPS didn't exist yet"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No it wasn't right, but the Swiss got over it (after downing over a dozen allied and German bombers and demanding legal and monetary reparations from both). 

And that means that slaughtering civlians of neutral nations is justified, when the best retaliation they can hope for is monetary compensation?  
Is it excusable to such a degree, that you give the ""well shit like that just happens"" to participating troops?

As that is what the US did.  
Nothing.

For that matter, it didn't pursue legal actions towards japanese attacking non-military targets on pearl harbor, fearing that it would create precedents that could lead to convicting its own airmen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And yes many thousands of Allies were convicted of wrongdoing both during and after the war, and more than a few were executed for their crimes, which is more than can be said for the majority of Japanese and German war criminals. 

Well sometimes we convicted a few war criminals, we only let run most of them, won't make you morally upright.

Sure you are not as bad as Hitler.  
However there are plenty of groups that are not as bad as Hitler, but still terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are still a liar and a pathetic revisionist. So much for the vaunted European education scheme.

Of the four you have, which one do you think is the best starter? New Age? And for an more experienced player War Eternal / or the new one? 

I myself own War Eternal after finding a decent deal on it on the second-hand market. So figured, what the heck, if I like it then it's a keep. If it's decent, I'll play it once every while (which is the case for me) and keep it for the time being. If I feel like selling, I'll probably get more for it than I paid for.

Yeah from what I've read myself. I guess Arkham is more for 2p (for the narative). LOTR LCG is about the puzzle/deck building experience which is probably best for solo. I'm not that into Marvel/super heroes myself. Maybe that is because I'm European, or because superheroes is a bit before my time as YA, or because LOTR had such a big impact on my life through D&amp;D (2nd, 3.5e and GURPS).

I've dated far more than I have been in long-term relationships. And this is just my experience.  Plus it's  a broad question, and there are many facets to a relationship, so I won't necessarily write a whole book of what I've learned for me, thus far.

 In relationship, between a man and woman, I think there are 2 skill sets.  One is dating and attracting a woman.  The other is picking out a good woman that you are compatible with , and managing it so neither of you are miserable.

I would say, live with that person for 6-months to a year, before you even consider marrying them.  You don't find out who they really are until you actually start living with them.  And you don't know if either of your quirks are going to severely get on each others nerves. Or if they have been hiding problematic habits from you.

You want her to be happy with you? Do whatever you can to make her life as easy as possible.  That does not mean, be a doormat. That does not mean be a little bitch, yes-man.  What I mean is, you want to do things for her on your terms.  Hopefully you have a woman that is emotionally low-maintenance.  Because emotionally high-maintenance woman are taxing. Is the juice worth the squeeze? Is she worth the time and effort?  There's also emotionally IMPOSSIBLE women.  Woman that are straight up committed to being miserable, touchy, argumentative... and worst of all, they do not appreciate jack shit.  Do not ever stay with a woman that does not appreciate who you are and what you do.  Woman like this, it doesn't matter if you are 6'2"", put Brad Pitt or Daniel Henney to shame in terms of looks, and are able to take her on a luxury vacation through Europe for month.  They will still find a way to be moody and bitchy and blame you over some imagined slight.  

As for keeping a woman, I would say that being a man is a thankless job.  Not always, but in most situations, you are expected to be the support. The rock.  A woman stays with you as long as she feels like you're a winner, and she can't do better.  

A woman falls out of love if you are not pulling your own weight. A woman falls out of love if you are needy, clingy, pathetic, emotionally manipulative vampire. You don't have to be that good-looking or tall, as those things just merely gets your foot in the door.  You have to be fun, funny, and have things figured out.  Having and earning money is a pre-requisite.  

The best relationships to me are the ones where you bring out the best in each other.  You support each other, motivate each other. She turns you on to new things, and you turn her on to new things.  

If she can push your buttons and bring out the worst in you, you are not in control of the relationship. If you are not in control, both of you will be miserable.  Woman do not want control and power in the relationship (and those that do have control issues, tend to be perpetually miserable. Universal truth, you cannot control everything and everybody, you can only control yourself and how adaptable you are).  Woman want to relinquish control to a man who's got it all figured out, and be pampered, charmed, and spoiled by their man (but a woman deeply in love are definitely very considerate, supportive, and helpful).  I'm not saying this as a law, but for most heterosexual, emotionally healthy women, this is the case.  

Most of all, I would say do your best to be a complete, whole man.  If you have yourself figured out, everything else will fall into place.  You need to know what you can and cannot live with.  

Also, if you're considering marriage, make sure you are okay with their family.  There are times when her family problems becomes your problems too.

In 1919, there was a major war scare with Mexico over the attack on American diplomats and a threat to nationalize the oil industry (largely owned by Americans), which gave at the worst possible point as America was already in the throes of the First Red Scare. Congress at this time also produced documentation of Pro-German and Pro-Bolshevik actions within Mexico, inflaming the crisis. Ultimately it came down solely to President Wilson.

For more info:  
[Woodrow Wilson and the Mexican Interventionist Movement of 1919](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890080?seq=1)  
[1919: William Jenkins, Robert Lansing, and the Mexican Interlude](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30236652?seq=1)  
[Tempest in a Teapot? The Mexican-United States Intervention Crisis of 1919](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30236622?seq=1)

Of note, to me personally, is this statement before Congress by Congressman J.W. Taylor of Tennessee:

&gt;""If I had my way about it, Uncle Sam would immediately send a company of civil engineers into Mexico, backed by sufficient military forces, with instructions to draw a parallel line to and about 100 miles south of the Rio Grande, and we would...annex this territory as indemnity for past depredations . . and **if this reminder should not have the desired effect I would continue to move the line southward until the Mexican government was crowded off \[the\] North America.**""​

These feelings were the culmination of a decade of frustration and anger with Mexico, stretching back into the height of that country's Revolution/Civil War. To quote from ""**An Enemy Closer to Us than Any European Power"": The Impact of Mexico on Texan Public Opinion before World War I** by Patrick L. Cox, *The Southwestern Historical Quarterly*, Jul., 2001, Vol. 105, No. 1 (Jul., 2001), pp. 40-80

&gt;The Wilson administration and the military again blamed the conflict on Villa. Governor Ferguson expressed the feelings of many when he advocated United States intervention in Mexico to ""assume control of that unfortunate country."" J. S. M. McKamey, a banker in the South Texas community of Gregory concluded, ""we ought to take the country over and keep it."" As an alternative, McKamey told Congressman McLemore that the United States should ""buy a few of the northern states of Mexico"" because it would be ""cheap- er than going to war."" The San Antonio Express urged the Mexican government to cooperate with Pershing's force to pursue those who participated in ""organized murder, plundering and property destruction.""",True,False,False,,,,0,1601666810,,False,0,{},g7fmhyo,False,t3_j3u4so,False,True,t3_j3u4so,/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/j3u4so/what_if_woodrow_wilson_catches_the_h1n1_virus_in/g7fmhyo/,False,,1613849476,1,True,False,HistoricalWhatIf,t5_2si7z,r/HistoricalWhatIf,public,,0,[],

Please read u/Updatebjarni's answer(s). 

**TL;DR**

It's ~~late 80s~~ at least 1991, it has an FSK modem, a CRT, ~~a 10-digit incandescent display~~ and possibly some kind of input peripheral. Some kind of subway/bus/train ticket machine logic board?

**Analysis**

First of all, it looks like it's been made between 1985 and 1992 to me, and it looks like it's been made (or at least designed) in Europe, judging by the components.

If you look at the left side, you'll notice a potentiometer and three ports, labeled X505, X506 and X507. There is an unpopulated slot for X508, covered by a sticker: this gives us a pattern, ports are likely named X501 upwards.

On the board we have X503, which is a two-pin connector, probably for a fan or a speaker and X501, a four-pin keyed connector which is kinda generic and seen in a lot of things. X504 really looks like a flat connector to me, it even has an indent for the cable. I think X502 is the weird-ass blue connector on the down-right side of the board, but the markings can't be seen clearly.

I think that's it for ports, now let's take a look at the ICs.

The big chips (from the top-right) are:

* Toshiba TC55257BPL-85, a 32kB CMOS SRAM
* Texas Instruments TMS27C256-20JL a 32 kB EEPROM
* MOSEL M6264L-10PC, a different kind of CMOS SRAM
* STMicroelectronics EF9345P, a CRT controller

The SIEMENS SAB 80532-N and AMD 79101PC have been correctly identified by u/polprog and u/jet_heller, and are an MCU and a FSK modem.

By looking at the placement of the components, I'd say that the Toshiba SRAM is the MCU RAM, and the MOSEL SRAM is the VRAM.

The TI SN74LS145N just south-west of X504 (which is a BCD-to-Decimal Decoder/Driver, which is able to drive 10 digit incandescent displays (as per  [http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/SN74LS145-D.PDF](http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/SN74LS145-D.PDF)). The SN74HCT373N north-west of the same port is an octal latch, probably used as a buffer for some peripherals. The other small chips are either flip-flops, decoders or demuxes. There's also a 555 timer between the battery and the pot: ~~this means that the system can keep track of the time (the other SN74HCT373N with barely visible markings on the right of the battery is~~ *~~proably~~* ~~used for that), and the battery keeps the 555 alive while power is not applied to the board (since all of the RAM is static, it does not need any power to ""remember"" its contents).~~

Initially, the board looked like a dumb terminal logic board to me, but if you look at X505 you'll notice that it's too wide to be a DB-9 printer port, and too narrow to be a DB-25. I'm not even sure that X506 is a DB-25 port. Besides, the screw studs on X505 and X506 are still attached: while this could mean that an overzealous employee reseated them after uninstalling the bracket from the board, to me it looks more probable that the board never had such bracket to begin with, meaning that it was meant to be tucked away in some kind of bigger piece of equipment. The absence of holes for the bracket's nuts and bolt in the back side of the board seems to confirm this.

Could it be a modem, then? Yes, but why should you have a pot, an incandescent driver and, lo and behold, a CRTC in a modem?

 It's overplayed, that's what it is. Stood in my house for 8 months already, 1 month prior for it to come to Europe.

 Saw the % rate, the risks involved, if you're young, healthy, no heart disease or a diabetic and not overweight the chances for you to die are minimum.

 The disease is here, it might be done in a lab, it might not be. There's a lot of propaganda on all the sides, and China won because of this, I'm telling you this, as a right wing European, with no allegiances for U.S politics, rather a disgust for it. You've all been played by politicians, on both sides but at the moment Biden and his crew is the most dangerous one, by not knowing their allegiances and their even more shady politics, that's my take on it.

 The virus is here because the poor containment from China, not closing their external flights before it was too late. WHO was also controlled by the CCP.

 I'm done with ""Masks are the solution"", no the solution is either get SUPERIOR masks to protect yourself and social distancing.

 TDS is real, I've seen it on Reddit, you may dislike his policy or his character, but I didn't see him call ANY BLACK PERSON a SUPER PREDATOR. If you really want to go down that hole, to protect a man that KILLED millions (serbians, syrians, libyans, iraqians) etc. it's on you. But if you're going to tell me that Trump is worse than Biden, he's not.

 No one is publicly calling it a hoax, apart from crazy people, but it's not that dangerous. Anyway, check the death rates for people in 2019 in the same period, there's little change to the amount of death.

 I don't care at this point, people should understand there's no safety, there never was when it came to disease, this is beyond stupid at this point. The virus is here to stay and you either keep distance from people or you don't, the whole morality shtick of ""bravery"" ""courage"" ""sacrifice"" is becoming obnoxious.

 Vote in your election and stop politicizing a pandemic, or at least point to the real criminals, which are in Asia, then maybe you could talk about domestic policy.

 And well, GDP increase of 11% in China during a pandemic tells you everything you need to know, Obama's loans for the 2008 bail-out from China etc.

 You don't have to be a rocket scientist, but I'm wasting my time here, you've all been too brainwashed to pick a side.

&gt;
&gt;► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use[ Trump real estate to launder money.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html) In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.
&gt;
&gt;► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html), Apr 30, 1992)
&gt;
&gt;► [Felix Sater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater } is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. [He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-felix-sater-trump-associate-at-center-of-the-mueller-russia-probe-2018-11 ) He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.
&gt;
&gt;► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and [Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2016/10/03/donald-trump-and-the-felon-inside-his-business-dealings-with-a-mob-connected-hustler/#873b09222824 ) Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.
&gt;
&gt;► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, [Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev,](https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190217/trump-in-palm-beach-did-russian-mansion-buyer-make-money ) a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.
&gt;
&gt;► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. [Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/trumps-top-targets-in-the-russia-probe-are-experts-in-organized-crime/569056/) That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.
&gt;
&gt;►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)
&gt;
&gt;► According to a [Bloomberg investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs ) (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”
&gt;
&gt;► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. [A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)
&gt;
&gt;► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. [Russia is a mafia state.](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/05/19/inside-vladimir-putins-mafia-state ) That is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.
&gt;
&gt;►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the [FBI described Kislin as having ties to the Russian mob.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/ ) Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.
&gt;
&gt;► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. [The NRA](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/27/764879242/nra-was-foreign-asset-to-russia-ahead-of-2016-new-senate-report-reveals ) got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell [got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/mcconnells-biggest-donor-isnt-russian/ ) In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Craig Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.
&gt;
&gt;► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Donald Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, [saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2)

Je rajoute ma voix aussi pour Apollo Cannabis, très bon service. Mon conseil, surtout avec un diagnostique en santé mentale: ne cache absolument rien. Ils sont pas là pour juger. Moi j'ai eu de la grosse misère à être 100% honnête au début, j'avais peur qu'ils me jugent comme j'avais commencé à m'auto médicamenter avec le récréatif (j'étais pas consommateur avant!)... Mais pas du tout. Limite, ils ont considérés ça comme un avantage je pense: j'ai été en mesure de tester et sentir le améliorations avant leur intervention, et ça été pris en compte positivement dans mon entrevue j'en suis certain.

Donc dis tout. Cache rien. Sois honnête dans ton parcours et tout devrait bien aller! C'est rendu tellement facile accéder au médical, que ça vaut la peine de tout dire malgré la possibilités de se faire dire non, ne serai-ce que pour avoir accès à une ressource qui est légitime pour t'aider. Et bon, SI tu te fais dire non, c'est qu'il y a une bonne raison médicale aussi, faut être prêt à accepter ça, ça fait parti de la game.

Le seul point faible à mon sens pour Apollo: je trouve que leur suivi est soso, ça m'a semblé très générique. Cependant, je suis un cas très générique et ils me répètent *souvent* de ne pas hésiter du tout à les contacter en cas de questions et de problèmes. j'imagine que si je le fesais, je trouverai moins le suivi générique! ;-)",True,False,False,,,,0,1601673979,,False,0,{},g7g65k1,False,t3_j41qf0,False,False,t3_j41qf0,/r/QCannabisMedical/comments/j41qf0/tanné_dêtre_le_rat_du_psychiatre/g7g65k1/,False,,1613858821,4,True,False,QCannabisMedical,t5_31hlim,r/QCannabisMedical,public,,0,[],
