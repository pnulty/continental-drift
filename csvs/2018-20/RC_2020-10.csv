GenG are very strong. They rekt T1 in qualifiers, and every one expected T1 to be the team that make it to worlds. it reminded me of worlds finals 2017. because yes, GenG is actually SSG from 2017. i place them 2nd because they have an history of wonky Bo1s. (LCK plays Bo2s during regular seasons)

EU is actually very overrated aside from G2. FNC is all over the place and fail to have a core identity. the one thing they are good at, is beating chinese team that arent called iG. 3rd

Preferring light skinned women is rooted in racism but I would call it colorism specifically. Basically it’s the idea that darker skin makes someone unattractive without even looking at the rest of their qualities (physical or character/compatibility).

Skin tone should be irrelevant when looking at eye color, hair color etc. The point is that if you won’t even give a black woman or darker skinned black woman a chance that is racist/colorist. If you say you don’t find any black women attractive even if you haven’t seen them, that’s horrible.

Having a preference for some features, for example blonde hair, is often rooted in European beauty standards which positions POC as less attractive. Having a preference for one trait isn’t always a bad thing but if you say oh I just prefer blonde hair but then see a black woman with blonde hair and would not ever give her a chance, then its problematic. Additionally a preference is one thing but saying you would never date x race, is when it is racist.

That's not up to you to decide. Clatching on to concern trolling to deny people self determination and independence. You're bellyaching about Western Armenia but you don't want to return Canada. Why not? Is Armenian culture and identity more precious than Native culture and identity?

&gt; That was over 20 actually, those are grouped together as a nation. Oh and also the Squamish. I only spoke for them as they're loc to me and I've been there. I've seen really bad situations too.

20 out of 3 continents is still pathetic. Your points show just in how much denial you are about what a catastrophe the White Man's arrival has been in the Americas and Oceania. 

&gt; I again say that based on economy and they're survivability. Not based off prejudice. I don't want it to happen, but if they want they can vote out again, they tried twice and came to almost 50/50, and less last time.

Oh yeah Quebec isn't gonna survive economically. What a joke. Just another excuse for a chauvinist.

&gt; Strawman, I already disproved that claim. How about you prove you aren't.

Disproven nothing. You employ the same exact White Man's burden language.


&gt; I'm glad that's your opinion, as I hoped it was. They deserve to be autonomous or free, and not worry for their lives; which is a point I've been consistent on.

No you haven't been at all consistent. 

&gt; That's sad &amp; rude, and I already said I'm fine if they want indendence. Whilst I prefer confederations, if they want to be self-determined they can be. I am not stopping them, nor would I if I had power.

Sad &amp; rude eh? Says the guy who was name calling in his last post. I don't care you prefer. And if they ever called for independence and suggested you move back to Europe you'd be howling instead of melancholically musing about how the it's not just that the Natives lost the Americas to the Europeans. 

&gt; The fact you keep insulting me and assuming my beliefs shows your racism and dishonesty here. Just because I am white means nothing, like how not all Turks hate Greeks.

I insult you because you are inconsistent and apply double standards and employ 19th Colonizer language. I don't insult you because you're White Canadian.

&gt; I like the fact African nations are free now, wish they were never colonised as it's caused too many tragedies. I'm glad slavery was abolished and is heavily enforced in most nations today.

Your posts sound like corporations embracing the BLM message. Empty and shallow.

&gt; What would it take for you to believe me? My beliefs are consistent and anti-oppression. I hate states in general, and see most as tyrannical. I also see people oppressed by worse states and wish they'd be free to live without free.

You're not consistent. You bellyache about Western Armenia being stolen while living in lands that were stolen. Why don't you attack your own government and people to liberate the Natives from oppression?

&gt; See Europe now for instance, nations like France, Denmark, and Germany are ideal for how too keep the peace; strong, liberal, and tolerant. They're also largely 80% homogeneous, yet still are tolerant of most minorities. See Canada, we're multi-cultural, as is our gov't. We have flaws, but we don't shoot minorities. Well except for evil and corrupt cops, but tell me one country where that isn't the case outside of western Europe and Japan.

Nations like France and Germany destroyed their multicultural identities in the centuries past and eradicated their minorities in huge historically significant events. What kind of moron holds up France as an example to follow? A nation that has willfully destroyed dozens of regional cultures within their borders and has left a bloodbath from Haiti to Vietnam to Africa. 

Minorities get shot when they rock the boat. When they have been exterminated to the point that they're without any power then they don't get shot.

1. It's morally objectionable. Unfortunately this isn't something I can argue, because it comes down to one's personal beliefs about how we should treat other people in our midst. But this type of nationalism is inherently exclusionary because it rejects the influence of outsiders or minority insiders. In practice, immigrant and ethnic minorities are denied equal opportunity at best, or are actively persecuted at worst. The strong desire to distinguish states from one another make international collaboration in solving problems more difficult.
2. It's *impractical.* We have a limited amount of desirable territory on the planet, and a finite number of practical-sized governments/countries. We are also a highly social species that travels and forms business, religious, social, etc. ties all across the planet. The idea that we can have separate countries or enclaves or governments for every social group that wants one is is not realistic, and we will never agree on how these things are allocated. Nationalism has been a driving force for war for all of recorded history. Nearly every conflict people blame on religion is essentially about nationalism.

Now, there are other types of nationalism. Some people just use the word to mean ""pride in one's country"", which is something else entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: in the context of 2020 politics, we are talking about 'white nationalism' where the nation is ""white people"" -- a group one is born into, or not -- and nationalism part is the claim that ""white people"" have a right to form a government to advance the interests of white people and control their own territory in the US and/or Europe. Most people would find that reprehensible, but strictly speaking this definition of nationalism would also include zionism (the Jewish claim on the geography and state of Israel) and the competing claim by Palestinians, the reservation system for America's native peoples, and countless other movements around the world. Nationalism is human nature and taking a hard line against it challenging because the consequences threaten people of all political persuasions.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601511539,,1601511939,0,{},g78i39j,False,t3_j2w58f,False,True,t1_g788pkj,/r/changemyview/comments/j2w58f/cmv_facebook_has_become_the_same_as_or_worse_than/g78i39j/,False,,1613727776,1,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

If you had HIV and vomiting and diarrhea, youd come in and get an IV, because dehydration on certain HIV meds could damage your kidneys. The little rooms had their own bathrooms and a wifi access point nearby so you could do work or read online. You also didn't have to be admitted to the hospital, so the come in for 3 hours, leave when you're a little better only took...3 hours. 

Other meds had side effects of liver damage. Thus, a lotta blood draws for liver damage (and kidneys as above). They had a phlebotomist nearby, so if you saw the main doc, and he wanted labs...he got blood drawn quick. No run arounds, no issues, because they wanted compliance.

&gt;non-native English is generally well accepted, provided meaning is clear.

This is where it really gets interesting. As others have mentioned, with different non-native Englishes in existence, trying to understand or establish what that clear common meaning actually is, might be very challenging in reality.

&gt;Every assessment framework I know emphasises ability to communicate and understand over grammatical accuracy.

To what extent are successful communication and comprehension contingent upon grammatical accuracy though? If some grammatical inaccuracy is tolerable in assessment, how much? Based on what standard? How does this change as learners move up competent levels? I understand that ""native speaker"" as a standard has been removed from the CEFR, for example, but I think this makes the assessment framework much more fuzzy and hard to work with in practice.

This gets back to my original question and other contributions relating to the justification for standards being used. Perhaps this is merely to do with the economic realities of most learners just needing functional English in the global marketplace. Perhaps some have grander motivations to end the ""hegemonic"" position of native-speaker English and this could be due to a post-colonial or a pan-European ideological viewpoint. There's lots going on here; it's fascinating.

Why would they? Without options like the US or the EU Serbia would likely align with whatever power they can. In the case of eastern European countries, many wind up in the fold of Russia. 

The US doesn't want countries turning to Russia or China. We prefer them coming to us, developing their countries, fighting corruption, setting standards, which in the end allows for more free trade.

The girls and boys which were beaten tried to make LGBT pride-which is unacceptable.We all know,what they are doing on this pride.
About the homophobes,it was inevitable,because of the all gay shit,that EU tried to implement.
I remind you,that the previous year БХК and the other NGOs gave students LGBT shit and ""anti-homophobia"" pamphlets.Of course,many of them were burned by the students,teachers or the principals.

Of course,aggression is not good,but when somebody tries to implement something unacceptable in the society,the citizens should repel it.

If you're claiming that China adopted eurocentric beauty standards prior to European infiltration, you're dead wrong. Their adoption of such standards is fairly recent. As Palomar College Professor Emeritus of Anthropology Dr. Dennis O'Neil [reports](https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/marriage/marriage_1.htm):

&gt;In China, round ""moon-shaped"" faces, like the one shown below on the left, have been considered exceptionally beautiful.  In contrast, angular Northern European faces, like the one on the right below, have been viewed as being undesirable.  Similarly, long-legged Europeans have often been stereotyped as being unattractively stork-like.  The Chinese also have traditionally thought that large female feet are ugly.  Prior to 1949, rich families sometimes bound the feet of their daughters tightly with cloth wrappings so as to stunt their growth.  This of course resulted in severe foot deformities that prevented them from walking normally.  However, it made it much easier for them to marry a rich man since they were now more attractive.  **Over the last two decades, mainland China has rapidly industrialized and developed modern high-rise cities.  They have also begun to emulate the life-styles of North America and Europe.  This has resulted in a change in middle class concepts of beauty**.  Taller Chinese men and women are increasingly viewed as being more attractive and successful.  Subsequently, there is a thriving business in surgery to increase leg length.  It is also becoming popular for women to use makeup and even plastic surgery to acquire more European-like faces.

I recommend that you check out my post over in r/leftyincel where I debunk the scientifically baseless myth that beauty standards are biologically determined or sociohistorically universal: [Are Beauty Standards Universal?

Yeah, no, health experts literally said banning travel at that point wasn't going to prevent the inevitable - that the disease was already in the US and **more measures** were needed to contain it. Find me one who actually said otherwise. The idea that Trump should be praised for doing the extremely bare minimum is laughable.

Meanwhile:

- He cut CDC staff working in China prior to the outbreak, epidemiologists included.

- He refused to refer to the playbook set by his predecessor, something that could have helped combat this outbreak.

- He failed to properly replace the staff on the pandemic response team. This is egregious because it resulted in a lack of co-ordination on a federal level.

- Notably, that lack of co-ordination meant that while the CDC initially botched its tests, the FDA was slow to grant state and private labs the authority to produce their own tests.

- This then delayed the deploying of mass testing, which had a domino effect on contact tracing and carrying out quarantines/isolation. For obvious reasons, that's a significant reason why containment of the outbreak failed in the US.

- He was still golfing and holding political rallies in February rather than focus on dealing with the outbreak.

- He constantly referred to it as the 'China flu', fueling racism towards Asian Americans.

- He initially downplayed the severity of the disease, causing many of his supporters to not take it seriously.

- He refuses to wear masks in public despite being in a position to encourage people to do so.

- Notably, a plan to send masks to every American in April was scrapped by him.

- He also constantly touted a drug without proven efficacy and with known severe side effects.

- Recently, he seems more interested in rushing through a vaccine before the elections for no other reason than political expediency. That poses a huge risk to public health and would absolutely bolster the anti-vaxx movement.

Yeah, go ahead and defend that.

&gt;They stupidly told everyone not to bother wearing masks in public since ""it won't keep you from catching Covid, only from spreading it yourself""

Literally never said by the CDC. There was no evidence of asymptomatic spread being that prevalent, so their advice at that point was to only wear a mask if you have symptoms so as to ensure an adequate supply for frontline workers.

Like I said, you really need to do your research.  The image of the US abroad is reflected in how much foreign aid nations accept.

Quite a few countries in Europe became upset when we spoke up about the complete failure of other member nations to kick in to the UN.  So naturally everyone started bitching.  No big deal. We pulled out of the Paris climate accords because it was a license for India and China to “catch up” with their pollution before reduction.

I have some Muslim friends but I don't feel there is a need to tell them since I didn't tell all my family members about it. My religious believes (or their absence) is something private for me.

(2) Marriage: My wife is Muslim and knows about my apostasy. We love and respect each others. My family is the most important thing in my life as for my wife.

(3) Childhood Religious Friends: they don't know.

(4) Childhood Religious Family (ex. cousins, aunts/uncles, and grandparents): Since them knowing would make a lot of problems for my wife who is still Muslim, we have agreed to not tell them.

(5) Religious Family: Only one of my brothers knows. The rest of my brothers and sisters would be shocked if they knew because I always was the practicing ""good Muslim"" in the family. But they are not religious so it would not bother them. My parents would be hurt pretty badly: they took us from europe to the middle east to teach us Islam and Arabic. There was a lot of hard times and sacrifices and they always felt that it was worth it at least as one of their children (me) ""succeeded"" to be a good Muslim and build a good Muslim family. At each birthday my mother write me a letter and in every one of them she praises god for me being a good son and a good Muslim. They would accept me if I told them but I don't want to hurt them. 

(6) Values &amp; finding someone with good values &amp; high character without needing the fear of god from religion: I'm already married so that's solved. One thing I and my wife released is that religions is way too over estimated in regard to its influence on our morals. Very few things has changed since I left religion regarding my behavior.

While I'd agree that it would be nice to have Armenia in NATO, and it would be great if Turkish-Armenian relations were better than they are, there's just no way that the two are going to suddenly start cooperating when the Turkish Government continues to vehemently deny the Armenian Genocide and Armenia effectively exists on the perpetual brink of war with Turkey and their close ally Azerbaijan.

To get more into why Armenia just isn't going to join NATO any time soon, it becomes necessary to look into NATO's purpose and goals, the immense strategic significance of Turkey, and the unfortunate reality of Armenia's geopolitical situation.

To put it simply, NATO's sole purpose is to oppose the spread of Russian (formerly Soviet) influence, namely in Europe. To this end, the NATO member states have pledged a mutual protection treaty, guaranteeing that should one come under attack, all will answer the call to arms. This has allowed the United States and her allies to form a strong united front against Russia, allowing them to dictate the terms of a potential war with Russia to be as favorable for themselves as possible. Key to this strategy is the ability to strike directly into the Russian Steppe and seize or destroy Moscow to bring about a crushing early defeat. The hope is to bring Russia to its knees before the Kremlin can fully mobilize the country. Originally, Turkey was admitted to NATO as a forward missile base from which the US could strike directly into the Soviet heartland, but since then the US has realized what a geopolitical goldmine Turkey is.

Turkey's strategic location and geographical features make it an ideal candidate for opposing Russian power in Central Eurasia. To start, the rugged interior of the Anatolian peninsula is a natural fortress, allowing Turkey to set their own rules and fight defensively should they become embroiled in a war with a foreign power, such as Russia. Secondly, Turkey exercises complete control of the Bosphorus strait, allowing them to control trade or warships coming in and out of the Black Sea (giving Turkey power over any country reliant on the Black Sea for foreign trade, for instance Russia). And finally, Turkey has also long served as the gateway between Europe and the Middle East, allowing NATO to exert influence into the Middle East through Turkey. Because of this, Turkey is perhaps the most geopolitically important member of NATO, and as the current Turkish administration continues to flex their muscles and build a network of power across the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and Eastern Europe the significance of Turkey on the global stage seems to only be on the rise.

Finally, we must look to Armenia, and to be blunt, Armenia is just irrelevant on the geopolitical stage. While Turkey is powerful enough to create its own sphere of influence outside of and within NATO, Armenia has struggled to find a place in the world since achieving its independence. From the very beginning Armenia was locked in a bloody war with Azerbaijan (itself a Turkish nation and close Turkish ally), which combined with the Turkish State's continued refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide has irreparably damaged relations between these nations. In such a state, Armenia needed friends and they needed them quick, but with nothing to offer but their land and people the world has remained largely apathetic to the Armenian struggle. The only exceptions to this have been those countries for whom opposing the spread of Turkish power is a priority, namely Russia and Iran. For the former, Turkey represents a major NATO threat and geopolitical rival in Eastern Europe and the Arab world. Meanwhile, for Iran, Turkey has historically been a sleeping bear, uninterested in the Middle East at large, but with massive potential to interfere with Iranian plans for the region. Because of this, Armenia has found itself bedfellows with two of the US' most hated rivals, making Armenia by proxy an enemy of the United States and by extension NATO, despite many people within these countries having a generally neutral or even positive opinion of Armenia.

TL:DR - Armenia is an incredibly unlikely NATO candidate, and there really isn't anything to be done at this point that can change that.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601542140,,False,0,{},g79olpm,False,t3_j20kfj,False,False,t1_g75yxkr,/r/imaginarymaps/comments/j20kfj/armeniaazerbaijan_conflict_solution/g79olpm/,False,,1613747933,2,True,False,imaginarymaps,t5_2vqof,r/imaginarymaps,public,,0,[],

&gt; Ministers would decide whether to notify the commission of any government subsidy decisions that could impact goods trade in Northern Ireland and whether to waive the need for export summary declarations when sending goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.The two sides are currently examining these issues in a joint committee but the UK government has said it needs the legislation as a &amp;quot;Safety net&amp;quot; should the EU act unreasonably.

&gt; A government spokesperson said: &amp;quot;We will respond to the letter in due course. We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures related to the Northern Ireland Protocol.&amp;quot;We need to create a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK&amp;#039;s internal market, ensure Ministers can always deliver on their obligations to Northern Ireland and protect the gains from the peace process.

&gt; The commission has also said it might bring a separate action against the UK through enforcement mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement, resulting in fines or suspension of parts of a future trade deal.

I’d especially recommend videos on comparative method and historical linguistics, like [*How do we determine what languages are related?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgzkQ8oktD4), [*Indo-European Languages: An Intro*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UQnSmEzxMI), [*How does language change*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHPZ4RBQonk), [*Reconstructing Languages*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxPnYlJ0nRE), [*Dating of Old Norse Poems*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjVqubkpTTU), and others from the [*Language History* playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLATNGYBQ-TjrI_zstt5w13eB4IFIcuX_W).

If you’re interested in historical linguistics and the comparative method you might look at [*Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction*, 2nd ed.](https://archive.org/details/ComparativeIndoEuropeanLinguistics) by Robert Beekes – this is an academic textbook with exercises in reconstruction.

If you’re interested in the Kurgan culture origins of Indo-Europeans and archaeological data supporting it, you might take a look at [*The Horse, the Wheel, and Language*](https://books.google.pl/books?id=0FDqf415wqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+horse+the+wheel+and+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCkNSZnZPsAhWDxIsKHSyvApIQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20horse%20the%20wheel%20and%20language&amp;f=false) by David Anthony – it gives a short overview of the linguistic evidence for Indo-European culture and overview of the reconstructed culture, gives rough chronology of separation of various IE branches and their migration paths, and then in the second part pretty extensively describes the archaeological evidence for supposedly early Indo-European cultures. But note this is not a linguistics book – it is rather an archaeology book about looking for cultures known only from linguistic data.

If you’re interested in comparative method in Indo-European literature, then grab Calvert Watkins’s [*How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European poetics*](https://books.google.pl/books?id=Ri4sbTiMKN4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=how+to+kill+a+dragon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6-eaGnZPsAhUklIsKHQhADSoQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20to%20kill%20a%20dragon&amp;f=false) – but beware that this book casually presents you with passages in Hittite, Old Irish, Old Norse, Sanskrit, various ancient Greek dialects, and expects you at least to be familiar with their phonology. Not an easy read.

Genocide is to have intent. The person Churchill was fighting was the one with the intent to do those things.

&gt;Following the announcement this week that the government would introduce Kent Access Permits to ensure heavy goods vehicles travelling to the port of Dover and the Folkestone Eurotunnel crossing **do not set off without the proper paperwork**, the transport industry was quick to point out Whitehall had not begun testing the technology on which they would depend.

Rather than fixing the problem, the government are trying to prevent trucks from starting their journeys at all. ""Oh it's been a great success, there are no backlog of lorries waiting to be processed"" when the reality is that they're all stuck at source rather than in Kent. I can understand this from a logistical POV to prevent the roads getting clogged up but obviously they're not prepared.

&gt;But KAPs, as they have become known, would only be issued to truck drivers who get a green or amber rating from the online Smart Freight system, which the government has yet to introduce.

&gt;The transport industry has yet to test the system and, according to reports, a beta version will not be ready until mid-December, with the release version not expected until April, well after the end of the Brexit transition period.

&gt;Sarah Laouadi, manager of European and international policy at Logistics UK, told The Register that the industry body had seen a version of the system demonstrated on a shared screen, but had not been able to explore the system itself, or understand exactly how freight companies should align processes to meet the needs of the software.

It will be a miracle if that system works without disruption. There are going to be some shipments which get delayed or cancelled as a result, further harming UK businesses.

The UK can't get what it promised in the negotiations. And the Tory leadership is ideologically incapable of accepting the power asymmetry between the UK and the EU.

They appeared on Chinese maps before hand, sure, but China also appeared on European maps, that doesn't mean Europe owned China. 

There is a good academic piece that I'll cite below that describes, much better than I can, about China's and Taiwan's relationship with the islands. To summarize, while there was not de jure international recognition of them, there was de facto recognition by neighboring countries including Japan that the islands were Chinese.

Unryu Suganuma (2000). Sovereign Rights and Territorial Space in Sino-Japanese Relations.

&gt; They were uninhabited and never developed by China, and weren't mentioned in the Treaty of Shimonoseki which transferred Formosa and the Penghu Islands after the war.

In their ""Territorial Disputes"" museum (which is quite fascinating, I'd encourage history lovers to go take a look at an alternative view of Korea, Chinese, and Russian history) the historical and past legal justification for Japanese ownership of the islands is this passage from the Treaty of Shimonoseki

""the island of Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa (Taiwan)""

The fact of them recognizing this passage even in their museum today implies that Meiji Japan recognized that they were Chinese. That in addition the the de factor recognition that Japan gave to it provides pretty strong evidence that it was in Chinese control previous to the war.

&gt;The Senkaku Islands were kept under US occupation as part of Okinawa Prefecture. If Chiang Kai-shek had regarded the islands as CHinese soil, he could easily have demanded sovereignty over them along with hte rest of Taiwan. He did not, because nobody regarded them as having ever been Chinese at this point.

I would disagree with this idea of not claiming meaning that they don't think it's Chinese. 

&gt; The idea that they were Chinese arose in the PRC and ROC after 1971, especially when the value of the sea bed around them became clear. It is a completely illegitimate claim.

I'd agree that they only started caring about the islands a lot after their value was discovered but that doesn't mean that their claims are morally illegitimate. If we're speaking legally, the situation is clear of course. I think my main motivation behind this discussion is that while I recognize Japan has a legal ownership of the islands, I think the moral background of how they took it from Taiwan is very illegitimate but I guess that's the world we live in.",True,False,False,,,,0,1601551666,,False,0,{},g79xbey,False,t3_j33cdt,False,False,t1_g79w8g3,/r/taiwan/comments/j33cdt/taiwan_foreign_ministry_protests_japan_citys_name/g79xbey/,False,,1613752057,2,True,False,taiwan,t5_2qhrg,r/taiwan,public,,0,[],

Getting through the inhabited gamespaces by altering the environment, emphasis on the environment, changing the AI puzzles, maybe changing puzzles with shared parts, if necessary or on a whim.

The Dark Mod, it's the refined mechanics, especially rope arrow physics and mantling, but not the blackjacking.

The worldbuilding and how the lore is delivered.

The sense of a vast world without ever seeing 1% of it.

Verticality without the focus being on vertigo but getting somewhere and seeing or finding things.

Sound propagation and occlusion that works.  The processing pipeline takes a hit, and graphics need to be dialed back to allow for it, so no one does it but the old games, but it's huge for that experience, and still novel.

Ambience.  Unsettling as hell.  Few strategic long lines of sight without earning them.  If I'm playing an intruder, I need to feel I do NOT belong there, and getting caught or dying is deserved (and I'm not talking gaming skills, but social boundaries).

Like Europe today, mixing several centuries of tech and architecture in one mission, but alternate universe, where steam (doesn't have to be overt steampunk), not petroleum products, and clockwork (gears as an aesthetic not necessary), drive industry.

The good and bad sides of everything (science and religion, money, secrets), with the bad being overcome by the good.  Balance.

These days, if largeness means loading zones, it's unfortunate.  Largeness that isn't delivered in obvious portions when possible is better for immersion.

Claustrophobia, especially when bypassing or hiding from AIs.

The only difference is there are so many media companies that are against Trump. So you will see more lies in favor of the left wing as a whole. 

In regards to why you guys, Europeans, see more negatively of Trump is because Trump's policy has always been America first. He has attacked the European countries on many fronts to help the US like tariffs for imported cars and asking EU countries to spend more money on defense for NATO. 

If you are American you have to admit he is right in those points. European cars are cheaper here than US cars because of the low tariff. American cars are more expensive in Europe because of the higher tariff. So Trump is just trying to make it fair or the tariff at least equal to each other. 

In regards to NATO there is a doctrine that say all countries must spend at least 2% of their GDPs for NATO to defend Europe.

So exclude yourself from the question, exclude your personal bias and you'll see a very strong ethical reason to let go of the UK and move forward on the path that's so clearly voted for election after election: kindness politics and cooperation.

That said.  I'm not mad at Trump for Covid at all.  I think he did an ok job, not great, but not nearly as bad as Biden claims.

My philosophy is that you want the states to handle most of the work, and federal is merely there for support, which is what Trump did.

Because in the time of austerity, the social safety nets that were supposed to break my family's fall failed. Not only scaled back, the people in charge purposely overlooked and misrepresented people's realities in order to mindlessly cut back the budgets. Fortunately, through hardship, we were able to raise ourselves by our bootstraps. We were lucky on that end. Yet, the trauma remains. We aren't outgoing, we don't participate in society any more than we need to because when we fell, nothing broke the fall - we certainly became more selfish in a sense.

I don't see how a society in which no one cares about anyone else can succeed. I'm a firm believer that the measure of a civilization's success is the success of its less fortunate. And I won't screw over the thousands that benefit from those safety nets to punish the handful that don't. Reminds me of the poisoned M&amp;M analogy - but in the end, these are people we're talking about, OUR people, OUR european brothers and siblings, in case being just plain old people isn't enough, not M&amp;Ms. If everyone around us is better off, our bargaining power and attractiveness as a whole society increases, potentially kick-starting a cycle of increasing prosperity and progress. If we choose to ignore the less fortunate, we'll just go down a path of increasing inequality, frustration and, in time, erosion and unrest.

I think a less esoteric discussion is not whether this is racist, but whether this is tone-deaf. And, like, on Earth in the year 2020, is having a villainous black race that enslaves white people a faux pas? Jesus, on so many levels:

* now is really not the time to be a white person writing a book about slavery

* it's mostly not the time to write a fantasy book about slavery, unless it has clear historical antecedents and the slavery is the literal subject of the book

* a fantasy book about magical enslaved white people? dude, how even

* really, are you sure you want to make ""stylistic"" race choices in the year of fucking global race riots? like, what about this experience suggests that race is ""stylistic"" to you?

* claiming that, because your dominant race is non-white, your novel doesn't have the European antecedents common in fantasy doesn't really make any sense. If I dye a turd pink, it's still a turd. It's just pink.

So you have economists even in the 1980s claming to be arguing about today's problems, but effectively skirmishing over what is the best way to reform 1890s Austria or whatever.  Who cares.  I mean that is some interesting sidelight, but not relevant to today.

Anyway, capitalism/markets are clearly two of our most powerful economic tools.  But to function ideally they rely on a lot of assumptions that are not actually true.   So you really need to end up patching them quite a bit.  There are a lot fo places where capitalism and markets need intervention.

Socialism is more about what the minimum level of subsidy you need to provide the lower classes for optimal functioning in some area or other.  Whether that be to prevent them from being wracked with disease, starving to death, committing to much crime, or rising up in anger and needing violent suppression, whatever.  Its just about finding some balance point.  And obviously people will have disagreements about where that point is, or how much crime/violence/starvation they are willing to tolerate.

So I don't even think the capitalism/markets and socialism need to be in opposition.  They are solving different problems, and can be layered on top of each other.

There absolutely is, you're just not going to achieve that by unskeptically accepting that some musicians are just intrinsically better than others without understanding why well enough to explain the metrics by which you've reached that conclusion when pressed. If anything, that's counter productive to your ability to make informed critical analysis of music.

Music has layers and complexity. Refining your taste means refining *your* taste, not just changing it to whatever the agreed upon ""elevated"" taste is. If you want to refine your own taste then you can discover and explore the facets of the music you like that drew you to it...you don't have to change those things to match the facets of music you've been told are correct to appreciate.

If you like rap music you can make an informed criticism of that...the layered structure, the horizontal harmonic movement, the rhyme cadences, the timbrel motifs, all these are relatively new models of music analysis that we only developed because contemporary theorists weren't content just to write modern music off as not being ""refined taste"" or deserving of critical analysis.

All music has depth to be explored, and telling yourself that some is not worth exploring since others are just better...because they just are this the fastest way to never really think critically or develop an informed opinion about either.

&gt;Saying that I will take the opinion of someone who has listened to 10,000 records 1 time over the person who listened to one record 10,000 times.

Well then you'd want to take the opinion of the open minded contemporary theorists I'm citing, not the closed minded classical theorists that you are. What you just described as ""listened to one record 10,000 times"" is much more apt a description of the kind of snooty classical academic who refuses to acknowledge or listen to other music. 

Of course both are still valid opinions, and the person who listens to one record a thousand times is going to have a much deeper understanding of it than someone who listened to it once. That's *why* we have so much in-depth analysis of classical period european music. What I'm saying is *not* to listen to classical theorists just because they've listened to the same music enough times to have a better critical analysis of that then we do yet of more modern music.

&gt;The proof of an artists greatness is when so many people across cultures can appreciate it that you know something cross-cultural was expressed.

All that is proof of is a history of colonialism in the culture that music originated from.

&gt;I know I'm a pretty slick player myself so I'm far from thinking that it's something unattainable. Game just recognizes game, simple as that.

Is that so? You haven't expressed any understanding of theory or musical aptitude this entire conversation and your perspective is that of someone who's so insecure about their own taste that they default to whatever they've been told ""refined taste"" is without knowing why. I'm sure you're a very capable player but you're ironically really limiting yourself by being this closed minded.

Is that why you're so against the prospect of exceptional musicians not being a thing, because you've convinced yourself you are one? Am I challenging your identity by pointing out the fact that you don't have a good reason to believe music is hierarchical? Do you feel like I'm telling you you're a loser by explaining that there is no way to ""win"" music? Just some stuff to think about...

&gt;Great players always play with other great players, and they don't care if you think they are assholes for being picky about who they play with or if they think your playing isn't up to their standards, whether they be technical or emotional.

Is that true, or do we just always give the mantle of ""great musician"" to those that become famous and bands tend to get famous together? That's just a mistaken attribution of causation combined with confirmation bias. Most bands form out of situational convenience...they just happen to know each other and vibe well. In fact, this proves *my* point that good music is based on personal taste because whenever they try to force a bunch of ""great"" musicians into one band the results are disastrous. ""Super groups"" are notoriously bad for the *exact* reason that they're based on the fallacy of artistic exceptionalism being what makes bands work instead of the reality of it being the expressive resonance and understanding between band mates.

&gt;However I'm allowed to have my favorites, and I'm allowed to defend my opinion.

I never said you couldn't. I have my favorites too. All I'm saying is that we are allowed to have different favorites for different reasons and it doesn't make either of us empirically wrong. I never said you aren't *allowed* to like Mozart, all I said is that liking Mozart isn't the ""correct"" musician to like in order to have ""refined taste"".

&gt;And music still moves me to tears all the time, so if you think I don't know anything about the spirit, you would also be wrong.

In your eagerness to be defensive you misunderstood why I brought that up. Tuck your ego for a second and listen. I'm sure plenty of music moves you...but it probably doesn't affect me the same way, just like the music that really reaches me probably wouldn't do the same for you. My point isn't that either of us are bad at understanding the spirit of music, just that the ""spirit of music"" means different things to us. Our lists of favorite songs would be completely different...and not because I know great music better than you, or the other way around, but because the things that make music, or by extension musicians, ""great"" are entirely subjective.

&gt;I can quantify the ""nothingburgers"" if I feel like going into detail.

If that's true, then do it. You can't just pretend to be too disinvested to qualify your arguments now, after however many long ass comments we've both made. Lol. That's as embarrassingly transparent.

&gt;Let's see you post some music then get back to me.

Again your ego is getting in the way of your understanding. You can search my post/comment history if you're curious about my theoretical knowledge, I assure you it exceeds the power cords and diatonic shapes in your playing. However, you're still missing the point entirely if you think I'm trying to prove that I know what makes good music better than you do. Good music, to me, is just the music that I like...just like good music for you should be what you like (and not just what you think will make people impressed with your taste).",True,False,False,,,,0,1601564897,,1601567554,0,{},g7ajkby,False,t3_j1ttu2,False,False,t1_g79049n,/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/j1ttu2/why_is_rap_treated_as_a_lesser_form_of_music/g7ajkby/,False,,1613762627,1,True,False,LetsTalkMusic,t5_2t4it,r/LetsTalkMusic,public,,0,[],

My ex's sister is married to an American. And they had 2 weddings. One in the US, on here in Europe. So the people who came from Europe to witness the ceremony  (mainly) Family and some friends were to be honest.. pretty rude. On introduction, of one of the friends literally started the conversation with, ""I can shoot a coin from x feet away."" I was like ""ok... so?"" And he barrated me that real men should atleast fire a weapon once in their life. And how he doesnt understand that Europeans cant carry weapons around. ( some countries allow concealed carry or allow gunownage on private property)
So that wasnt a great start. Anyway; they had a few days before the wedding so me and my ex were assigned to do a small tour around Antwerp. We held a small break at one of the local pubs, next to the Cathedral of Antwerp. I explain why Pater's Vaatje was famous among Antwerpians and we entered. First thing I hear one of the peope say was; This place looks like shit, why dont they renovate it. This was after I explained the building was built way back and the owners are trying to keep it as authentic as possible.
Anyway, its not what he said; its the way he said it; loud and obnoxious. After tasting a beer or 2 we proceeded. The same guy and his best buddy ( I assume) couldnt just enjoy the older buildings and their history. It was all shit, ugly, etc etc. So anyway; on the wedding itself.. more bad experiences.  
Its like, I get it, you're proud of your city ( they all were from New York or a subburb of NY) but man. We cant help the fact our cities are 100's years old and therefor some streets are small and that occasionally you'll see some wear and tear on the outside of a building thats built in the 16th century. I cant help it our Loaf of bread ""lack sugar"" (what??) And its not my fault we ordered pizza thats cooked in a stone oven (Apperantly American pizza's contain fat and European pizza's dont??)
Overal, its because of those people I kinda dislike the American attitude.

Now why in the world would Europe be dependent on the US military? 

Maybe it’s because we didn’t let (Germany) them build one after world war 2, then only let them have a small one. Then Russia controlled like a big chunk of Europe after world war 2, then Soviet Union fell apart after Cold War, so those countries that were Soviet Union didn’t have military. 

So, the result after two big “wars” Europe has very little military because of insistence by US to have limited military directly controlled by European countries (backed by offer to protect European counties with its big US military) AND the collapse of the Soviet military in previously Soviet controlled countries. Which the US moved into and were like, hey we’ll help. 

We could have moved out of Europe right after world war 2 and just gave tons of money to Europe to rebuild a giant grand military, and then Cold War just given even more money to European allies to build even bigger militaries to “fight” back against the USSR. (While we built up here’s in American soil). 

But we wouldn’t “control” any of that. So, we kept doing the same thing we did after world war 2, which is offer to Europe in exchange for “control” over the military of Europe we will provide a lot of the military in the area. 

The concept of having large currently control of NATO, or the general region is to prevent: “Nazis” or essentially any military that represents interests against the US. 

Which is essentially a continuation of our initial no military, we’re your military concept in Germany after world war 2.

Nature and nurture.  Every human has tribalistic and xenophobic tendencies.  Those tendencies tend to vary based on various genetic factors, but we all have them to a greater or lesser extent.

That's the nature side of the equation.  For most of us, the nurture side mitigates those tendencies.  We learn to be more civilized and more tolerant than our primate ancestors.  For a few, their home environments amplify rather than mitigate bigotries.

Religion tends to be an amplifier.  It's no coincidence that the religious right in the USA is also aligned with racist and anti-LGBT movements.  Just look at the [list of intolerant sections in the Christian Bible](https://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/int/long.html).  While much intolerance in Christianity focuses on non-Christians, it's not hard to see how it can be interpreted as a rejection of ""other"", essentially amplifying tribalistic tendencies towards xenophobia.

Atheists, by never adopting or explicitly rejecting religion, tend not to have those attributes.

&gt; Lets say for example eugenics, im almost 100% sure many religious people will not even know what that is, while many atheist outside of reddit often like it.

I'll be honest, I've never met a person in real life that would cop to being pro-eugenics.  I've met a few on reddit, but even then it seems rare.  I happen to know a large number of atheists.

So when you say many atheists outside of reddit often like it, I doubt you.

Also, historically, most genocide has been along racial/ethnic lines, very frequently between enthnic religious groups and very frequently sectarian.  This isn't to say that religion is a motivating factor here, but the xenophobia inherent in most organized religion probably does not hurt.  Even in modern day, very few genocides are atheists killing the religious (China excepted).

&gt; And even worse, atheist in america, with atheists overall. In germany for example you could ask racist people if they are atheist, and a huge portion of them would say yes. Also the Pagan/Atheist Neo nazi scene is extremly big in europe.

Try that question in Poland when asking about homosexuals.  Or Turkey asking about Christians.  Europe is a mix of countries with different biases.

*The glans penis (head) is not a sexual erogenous zone. It only has pain, pressure and temperature nerves. It does not contain fine touch tactile nerve. The foreskin, frenulum and ridged band like the ciltoris and labia do contain fine touch receptors.*



*Male circumcision is extremely severe removing the 3 most sensitive parts of the penis and 1/2 of penile tissue. It is linked to frequently orgasm difficulties in men and pain and discomfort in their female partners l.  It can also causes the meatus to shrink  which at worst can making urination difficult and painful and at minimum cause weak urine stream and longer time to empty the bladder.*



*The foreskin, frenulum, and ridged band are the 3 most sensitive parts of the penis and all contains fine touch receptors such as Meissner's corpuscles, Epidermal Merkel nerve endings and Pacinian corpuscles. The glans penis does not and it's not a primary erogenous zone. It's made to sense the foreskin gliding across it but that's it.*






*The foreskin provides gliding action reducing friction and the need for lubrication. It's also provide plesure to not only the man and but also his partner.*




[The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis.The most sensitive location on the circumcised penis is the circumcision scar on the ventral surface. Five locations on the uncircumcised penis that are routinely removed at circumcision were more sensitive than the most sensitive location on the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x) 




[The glans penis is primarily innervated by free nerve endings and has primarily protopathic sensitivity. Protopathic sensitivity refers to cruder, poorly localized feelings (including pain, some temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical contact). In the glans penis, encapsulated end-organs are sparse, and found mainly along the glans corona and the frenulum. The only portion of the body with less fine-touch discrimination than the glans penis is the heel of the foot. In contrast, the male prepuce ridged band at the mucocutaneous junction has a high concentration of encapsulated receptors. The innervation difference between the protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the prepuce is part of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue. In females, the glans clitoris and the inner plate of the prepuce have corpuscular receptors on their oppositional surfaces. Merkel cells mediate tactile sensations, and are found in glabrous skin ; they have been reported in the clitoris and can be identified in the male prepuce.](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/)

and other types of mechanoreceptors typically found in primate glabrous skin (lip or digit) are not present in the glans penis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3697758/)



[The mean length of prepuce in this sample was 6.4 cm (range 4.8-9.2) and covered 93% of the mean penile shaft (6.9 cm). Ten prepuces were as long as or longer than the shaft of the penis to which they belonged; three of them were &gt; 10% longer than the shaft and glans combined. 51% of the length of the mean adult penile shaft, or more from nearly half the penises. CONCLUSION: CIRCUMCISION REMOVES MORE THAN HALF OF TOTAL PENILE SKIN](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/) 



[In conclusion, circumcision removes the most sensitive parts of the penis and decreases the fine‐touch pressure sensitivity of glans penis. The most sensitive regions in the uncircumcised penis are those parts ablated by circumcision. When compared to the most sensitive area of the circumcised penis, several locations on the uncircumcised penis (the rim of the preputial orifice, dorsal and ventral, the frenulum near the ridged band, and the frenulum at the muco‐cutaneous junction) that are missing from the circumcised penis were significantly more sensitive.](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x)




[Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in their female partners, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21672947/) 



[During intercourse the loose skin of the intact penis slides up and down the shaft of the penis, stimulating the glans and the sensitive erogenous receptors of the foreskin itself. On the outstroke the glans is partially or completely engulfed by the foreskin. This is known as the `gliding mechanism.'
The gliding mechanism is Nature's intended mechanism of intercourse. As such, it contributes greatly to sexual pleasure. Also, since more of the loose skin of the penis remains inside the vagina, the woman's natural lubrication is not drawn out to evaporate to a great extent, which makes sex easier without using artificial lubricants.The prepuce is a highly innervated and vascularized genital structure. It is entirely lined with the peripenic muscle sheet. Specialized ecoptic sebaceous glans on the inner preputial surface produce natural emollients and lubricants necessary for normal sexual function. The primary orgasmic triggers are found in the preputial orifice and frenulum. When unfolded, the prepuce is large enough to cover the length and circumference of the erect penis and acts as a natural sheath through which the shaft glides during coitus. Only the presence and functions of the prepuce allow for physiologically normal coitus to occur as designed by nature.](http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/)



[The analysis sample consisted of 1059 uncircumcised and 310 circumcised men.
For the glans penis, circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis).For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations.In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1464-41)

[],,ActualStreet,1538393280.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2bo87fra,False,False,[],"The number of patients leaving Britain and flying overseas for medical treatment has trebled as NHS waiting times reach a record high, a Telegraph investigation has revealed.

Government data shows the number of people going abroad for healthcare has increased from 48,000 in 2014 to almost 144,000 last year as the health service struggles to cope with demand.

Experts said lengthening waiting times for surgery - particularly hip, knee and cataract operations - and cutbacks to fertility treatment - were fuelling the rise.

NHS waiting times are now the longest they have been for almost a decade, with more than 409,000 people waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment - a rise from 34,000 in 2014.

Patient groups said the figures reflected badly on the NHS.

Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said: “It is a desperately sad state of affairs that people who have paid into the NHS all their lives are finding it is not there for them when they need it.

“These are essential operations, but thousands of people are being left in pain and misery - for every person who goes abroad there will be many more left suffering,” she said.

It comes amid a crackdown on “health tourism” within the UK. From Monday, hospital staff will be told to routinely ask patients for utility bills and bank statements in a bid to identify those from overseas who should be paying for NHS treatment.

The new figures from the Office for National Statistics show a 198 per cent per cent rise in trips abroad from the UK for medical reasons between 2014 and 2016.

Such treatments include dentistry and cosmetic surgery, which are offered more cheaply in many Eastern European countries. But health experts said the sharp rise reflected growing numbers of British patients going abroad for medical operations, amid lengthening waits and creeping rationing.

One medical travel website, Medigo, reported a 200 per cent rise in queries about orthopaedic treatment in one year, with rising numbers going to countries such as France and Switzerland for hip and knee operations.

Ugur Samut, it’s chief executive officer, said: “What we are finding is increasing numbers of patients from the UK wanting to avoid the waiting times on the NHS. We are especially finding that in orthopaedics, that is one of the biggest areas.”

Other countries seeing an influx include those which heavily market fertility services, with a ten-fold rise in patients flying from the UK to Spain.

A seven-fold rise was seen in medical journeys to Greece, another major area for IVF, with a doubling in travel to Hungary, where dentistry, fertility services and cosmetic surgery are popular.

Countries such as Switzerland and France, both popular for orthopaedic surgery, saw a six-fold rise and a 60 per cent rise respectively, between 2015 and 2016, the figures show.

Some of the most popular destinations, such as Poland and Romania, might also be explained by increased migration to Britain, with some returning to their native country for medical procedures.

The ONS statistics show 143,996 flights from the UK for medical reasons in 2016, compared with 100,338 in 2015 and 48,190 in 2014.

Under EU reciprocal arrangments, British citizens are entitled to have treatment elsewhere in Europe, with costs covered by the health service, if it is treatment the NHS normally funds.

Mr Samut said around 60 per cent of those seeking treatment abroad were aware of such rights.

Why is the NHS under so much pressure?
Professor Philip Schoettle, professor of orthopedic surgery at the Knee &amp; Hip Institute Munich, said: “We are seeing a lot of patients from the UK. A lot of the time it is people working in finance, whose insurance is international and they don’t want to spend all that time on a waiting list.”

“Germany has very low treatment costs - they can come here and spend their time lying in a luxury suite, with an a la carte menu and physiotherapy twice a day - they are getting first-class treatment and also getting pampered,” he said.

Scarlett McNally, from the Royal College of Surgeons said: “With over 400,000 NHS patients waiting longer than 18 weeks for planned treatment, and an increasing number of clinical commissioning groups restricting access to surgery for certain groups of patients, it is not surprising that some people will look elsewhere for healthcare.

“It is hard to say whether current strains on the NHS explain the rise in patients travelling abroad for surgery.  We are aware, however, that more patients are using private healthcare, at least in part because of longer waiting times.”

Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said he was “extremely worried” about the impact of rationing restrictions on couples trying to start a family. NHS access to fertility treatment is now the worst it has been since 2004, with just 12 per cent of areas providing three cycles of IVF.

“There is no doubt that rising numbers are going abroad for fertility treatment - we have seen a steep decline in access to IVF,” said Prof Balen.

A Department of Health spokesman said: “The NHS has recently been independently judged the best healthcare system in the world and is providing safer care to more people than ever before – last year 11.6 million operations were carried out on the NHS, 1.9million more than in 2010. 

“There are many reasons why people seek treatment abroad, and the total number who did last year is less than 1 per cent of those who began treatment in the UK.”

- Wetlands/forest 1 are buffed and that's pretty significant. the post actions are nice
- Wetlands/forest 2 buffed with an extra resource and pre actions, huge buff. most impactful change here imo. this is gonna lead to stronger starts which seems like a good thing on its own at least. 
- Wetlands/forest 3 &amp; 4 (especially 4) feel underwhelming. The next actual resource coming at 5 seems far away. Kind of wish 4 was still just extra resource and 5 was post action. 
- Every grasslands column nerfed compared to original boards which is a good change overall. Because eggs start lower though it increase sthe value of the higher egg columns.
- Grasslands 3/4 feel like a more rewarding track than wetlands/forest with the additional post action. 
- Wetlands preaction has pretty good utility i think, trade a food for better cards.
- The forest preaction though? Trade a food for a re-roll... you mean rather than just using that food combined with one of the foods in my original roll to get what I want? Seems like very little utility unless you need TWO+ specific resources and even then its still risky. This seems pretty poorly thought out to me. Forest 4 is extremely weak, and forest was already the weakest area IMO. Better be some good Forest birds coming. 

All that to say, it's a little concerning to me because I think a pretty optimal play is getting wetlands/forest to 2 and then going for grass. Grass got nerfed at the start and seems like that track has more to gain. Food/wetlands are buffed to be very serviceable at 1/2. 

Everyone here is saying they hope this stops egg spamming (Which I personally have zero problems with after European) - eggs did get slightly nerfed here but grasslands as a track got MORE rewarding in my eyes due to starting weaker and gaining more than the other tracks.

I call myself Mexican and American. 

While I get that sometimes for whatever reasons you may want to speak about origins, it just feels odd to me. Moreover, 2/3s of Mexico's territories lie now in the U.S. and large swaths of inhabitants in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and California at the least were originally Mexican to whom the border crossed them. Cities in the Valle de Texas, San Antonio, El Paso, Corpus Christi, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Las Cruces, Tucson, etc. have original folks from way back when. 

As to Mexico, you'll find the odd guy saying he's Spanish and Mexican of which there are many, but really you're just Mexican.

Things that happen in Dec.

1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. 
2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.

Quarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. 

Rest is storytime:

If this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.
Sell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. 

So how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the ""new management"" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. 

So the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:

https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98

Okay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.

Fantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.

But there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.

Now we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone.

I'm not sure what you're on about but you seem to have a problem with some specific UK government policy. I don't generally pay attention to the UK government. As I see it, their activity almost always boils down to a balancing act between maximising exploitation for the benefit of the rich on the one hand and minimising loss of votes from the poor on the other. Yet another policy that exploits the poor is not something I'm going to get excited about.

2 - The housing is part of that motivation system. As I said, this system would work to guarantee people don't crash and burn. It isn't just given. It's just a pick me up.

3 - Charities have a very limited scope. Social programs are much more robust ways to help people. Does that mean that charities have no place in society? No. Just that we should approach problems in a ""Those who want to do more"" fashion, rather than ""Those who want to do"". Also, it's easy for the more wealthy folk to abuse fiscal systems through charities, since they get fiscal benefits that in the end ends benefiting their own wealth, while allocating less funds in total through taxation and donation.

5 - Housing guarantee comes from a diverse set of policies with the objective of increasing access and affordability for the less fortunate. It doesn't mean everyone will have a quaint two story home on a nice suburb. It means that depending on your financial capabilities, you'll receive more or less support to keep your home, or, in the worst case, that you'll have a little place to stay temporarily while you get your act together, with support from social counseling and orientation.

6 - The only thing big multinational companies tell me about economies and their competitiveness is how weak the antitrust laws are. In our internal market we should foment internal cooperation to face the international competition if needed. Look at Airbus. If it's too easy to conglomerate and eat up the competition we ironically end up in an uncompetitive economy ruled by monopolies. Now THAT will hurt everyone. In sum, I support my local businesses, thank you very much, and if we need something bigger, a better strategy is to make it easy for our companies to dialogue and rise to face the foreigners. And can we afford to be more social? I spoke of the Nordics earlier. Not too shabby of a system. I think the rest of us can do something in the way of getting a bit more social, not necessarily to their level. So yea, we can afford it. Especially if we equate the benefits of the social policies on the productivity and health and well being of the population. Just because Europe is practically the gold standard comparing to the rest of the world, doesn't mean we can do better, more efficiently and more fairly.

7 - And once again you indulge a falacy. People in my country are free, but unlike Americans generally believe freedom to be, our freedom ends when the next person's begins. So are we really all free? Kinda. And those that overexert their freedom? They get their freedom taken away.

I guarantee that in this country, there will be a roof for you in case push comes to shove -&gt; overexert that right and screw over the people who contributed to that policy for your benefit, overexert your freedom, and some of that freedom will be taken away. Punishing mustn't be preemptive, must come after the transgression. And by looking coldly at economic indicators and disregarding the possibilities that occur in society, you are punishing people without them necessarily doing a bad thing. 

This may all look like scary socialist words, but I don't think it's that at all. I'm not a socialist, in any way, I don't need to study economics or political science to understand how harmful decisions made by centralized power made in a complete bubble can be...

I’m using Duolingo to learn Brazilian Portuguese. I’ll try Memrise in the future, when I have space on my phone for the app. I’ll need to look for YouTube videos to help. I found one of my Sister’s old phrase books too - I’ll note down main phrases to try to remember. 

Learning a little bit, but every day is helping me to stay motivated and remember what I’ve learnt.

After I’m comfortable with the basics, I’ll get a tutor and find Brazilian people who I can practice speaking with. Already knowing French has helped to make learning Brazilian Portuguese easier. 

I’ll surprise my Sister and my BIL with my knowledge next year, when his family visit. I hope people are able to understand when I speak it. It’s quite hard to get it right - words aren’t always pronounced by how they are spelt. There are quite a few different accents used with letters, way more than there is with French. 

Also, my BIL said that Brazilian Portuguese isn’t similar to European Portuguese, it’s a lot different. What do you think? My Sister knows European Spanish and South American Spanish, she said European Spanish just has a lisp, that’s the main difference - is that similar for Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese too?

Malaysia has nice empty beaches on the East coast to the North, and boat trips.

Indonesia is fine in the larger cities and has good healthcare, but again I'd avoid any

Europe can be interesting if you can get a car and want to use campsites in the good weather.

areas.

My family paid $8000 for the birth of each of our children. A single trip to the emergency room cost me nearly $2000. The hospital will not negotiate with people who have insurance, and they barely even offer payment plans anymore. The only negotiation I was ever offered for those bills was the opportunity to pay $1000 per month rather than the full amount all at once. I was allowed to pay over time with zero interest. That’s it.

Our family is upper middle class so we were able to absorb the financial hit, but it destroyed our savings. We have paid tens of thousands of dollars in the last few years just for medical care alone, and we are insured. We pay just as much in taxes as any European or Canadian, but have very little to show for it.

And in response to anyone who says that these bills are reasonable and affordable with a little bit of lifestyle adjustment, allow me to provide some perspective. I could spend $5 at Starbucks every single day for a year, and it STILL would not be as much as my emergency room bill for 6 hours of treatment. 

This person also has no clue what they’re talking about with the assistance available to lower middle class and poor people. Disability programs are very hard to qualify for and vary by state. Free clinics are usually overcrowded and provide substandard care. Hospitals are obligated to treat everyone that walks through the doors, but that obligation only covers emergency lifesaving care. Once you’re stabilized and not in imminent danger of dying, they’re allowed to kick you out without providing any follow up.

Except the reports don't say 7% are ""riots"".

[Here's a Twitter thread from an employee of the ACLED providing additional context, including the fact the 7% that's violent includes right-wing agitators and police officers.](https://twitter.com/sekhburd/status/1309157561149665281?s=21)


And here's the full Twitter thread formatted for easier reading since people like to pretend they can't read Tweet threads.


&gt;So I don't talk about my job very often, for a variety of reasons. However, one thing I do is track crisis data in certain parts of the world. This year ACLED (Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data) has been putting out data on the USA and our Protests.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So quick background, ACLED tracks ""crisis"" events around the world, but usually not Europe or the USA. They track stuff like Protests, Riots, Battles, Political Violence, etc. This year they are tracking the USA from 24 May - Now due to the BLM Protests.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So from 24 May - 19 Sept, there have been 12,662 separate incidents. 12,607 are classified as Demonstrations, and 55 as ""Political Violence"". The difference between the two is Political Violence is individuals that congregate for the express purpose of violence vs protesting.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So of these incidents, 67.58% are considered BLM affiliated, and 34.42% are ""Other"", including specific police brutality but not BLM related protests, or protests of non-Black police related deaths (eg: protesting latino, native, asian individuals etc deaths).

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***So here's the big one. 93.35% of ALL Demonstrations associated with BLM are Non-Violent. That means /NO/ vandalism, looting, etc. Only 6.65% are considered ""Riots"", eg Looting, and violence. 6.65%! That's around 500 individual incidents. That might seem like a lot but the final bit of data is WHO is perpetrating these 500 individual incidents, so lets look at that data. Of this data, only 21 incidents are classified as ""Mob Violence"", eg Protesters attacking individuals directly for whatever reason (ACLED does not attribute blame) ***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;So the incident of the man firing a bow into protesters would still be ""Mob Violence"". 28 Incidents are ""Violence against civilians"", eg George Floyd's death would be considered this. Non protest related police brutality. 28 incidents in 4.5 months.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***Then ACLED classifies 69 incidents as ""Excessive Force against protesters"", these are almost all Vehicular incidents, police or otherwise. That's 69 protests where someone attempted to drive over a protester or something similar.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Finally we have 623 ""Violent Demonstrations"". This is both BLM and non BLM related demonstrations in the US this year, accounting for that about ***6% of incidents***. It's important to note ACLED does not attribute blame, so we statistically cannot tell from the data who started any of the conflicts here, but the word ""Gas"" and ""Pepper"" appear in hundreds of entries, so you'll have to draw your own conclusion. ***Three interesting notes, one is that ""Antifa"" only appears 10 times. Out of all those incidents.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Another is that certain specific, civil war accelerationist right wing groups who I won't name so I don't get fucking brigaded show up twice, of which one ACLED classified as ""working with US Police"", so even groups like ACLED see whats going on with these orgs. Finally, ACLED has started classifying the US Police as ""Police Forces of the United States (2017 - ?)."" I would assume they are classified this way to distinguish the new ""off the leash"" Police that Trump is supporting vs previous more subtle US administrations.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The last place I saw them do this type of classification was in an African nation that had undergone a Coup so that they could categorize Pre and Post coup crisis data. That's how fucked up this data is. Anyways. This is a long chain so I just wanted to provide some actual info to people. 600 violent incidents might seem like a lot, but that runs the gamut of ""1 individual"" incidents eg: George Floyd and mass Riots eg: Portland vs. Feds. ***and thats out of 12000+ Incidents.***

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The bottom line. Protesting in the USA is by a VAST majority peaceful, Antifa is not a mass organized group causing a ""War"" in the USA, ***and the US policing has gotten so bad that we now warrant a CRISIS page on ACLED due to the potential political violence in 2020.*** Use this info as you will.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;***For those wondering who ACLED is or why do we care? ACLED is what the US Government uses to justify lots of our policy decisions in foreign places like Africa and the Middle East.

At the time the US was first colonized, our colonial overlords were transitioning from a late feudal society into absolute monarchy. Regional cultures and languages were being assimilated into a new national identity. See for example France and its language policy that erased the other Romance languages of France.

This tend continued during the colonial era up until roughly the modern era. Power became quite centralized in Europe at the national level. Sub-national entities have few powers, possibly not even the ability to tax, meaning it's impossible to have a huge number of local regulations to comply with.

The handful of republics like Switzerland and the US definitely saw centralization as well, but it seems like we maintained local authority. I suspect this is a result of both nations (roughly) coming together as a union of states.

This meant that when the EU and forerunners were getting started, treaties to set a maximum number of VAT rates in each country definitely had to deal with a plethora of special interests, but not too many random local authorities worried they'd lose out on tax revenue.

This made it easier to reduce the number of rates, as they knew the US was a clusterfuck of tax rates and rules, and their goal was to make international commerce pretty straightforward.

The US Constitution likely doesn't allow a national sales tax, making it harder for a similar effort to clean up tax rules, at least at a Federal level.

There's a trade-off here: 

Do you want local authorities to be able to adapt to local situations / experiment (possibly corruptly) at the cost of more variation (and thus a higher cost to comply with rules)?

Or should the central state reduce the number of differences to streamline compliance, at the cost of potentially imposing rules that make little sense in a local context or force bad rules on everyone?",True,False,False,,,,0,1601574743,,False,0,{},g7b63tj,False,t3_j2intr,False,True,t1_g789v53,/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/j2intr/are_labourvoting_areas_getting_preferentially_hit/g7b63tj/,False,,1613773339,2,True,False,LockdownSkepticism,t5_2iokxd,r/LockdownSkepticism,public,,0,[],

There's still a lot that hasn't been properly explored with OSM tagging for mapping marketplace stalls, market pitches and other informal sales sites. Outside of Europe &amp; North America these are often a significant component of the retail mix, but there are plenty of examples across the former two continents too.

Some examples of open-air markets, trying to show different possibilities:

*  [Cambridge Market](https://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=52.20570&amp;lon=0.11858) has been mapped with the loose fabric covers over the market stalls mapped as building=roof. Most of the stalls are permanent: not an insignificant number of regular UK mappers will remember Andy's Records on the market.
* [Wochenmarkt Helevtiaplatz](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2463960533) is twice weekly, with most stall holders having permanently allocated pitches as can be seen on the official plan. Outside of the opening hours the stalls are dismantled &amp; the square is available for other uses.
* [Flower stalls Ryne](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.06158/19.93881)k, Krakow. There are several stalls (mapped) which trade until early afternoon. I think they remove their stalls afterwards. To my certain knowledge stalls have been here since the early 1930s.
* [Mercado Orienta](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/437601370#map=17/12.14786/-86.25968)l, Managua. I cant remember who told me about this, but this place is absolutely huge with perhaps 35k retail outlets. An amazing challenge for mappers.
* Accra. Several marketplaces have been mapped in Accra, and often there is a Mapillary [trace](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2463960533) to provide an idea of what they look like.
* Ladies Night Market, Kowloon, Hong Kong (roughly in [this are](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/102422597#map=16/22.3178/114.1696)a).

We can't do this because it'd require us to societally admit that it is a true statement that the right wing disinformation apparatus wildly outscales the left because the right wing, at this juncture in history, is almost entirely driven by regressive, reactionary lack of policy.

Hell, just *the mere fact that you felt obligated to mention eliminating left wing disinformation* is part of that. Does it exist? Oh sure yeah.

It's not that we wouldn't have the world without the abolition of slavery, it's the other way around. We live in a world that is the *direct result* of slavery. The Industrial Revolution was already well under way by the time the United States was ramping up to the Civil War. The success of the Industrial Revolution was in large part driven by the rise of the consumer class; a group of people that can only exist if they can afford to buy things with their wages. The widespread availability to cheaply produced goods was possible in part because of changes in manufacturing processes that allowed larger numbers of uniform goods to made rapidly and in good condition, but in a larger sense the reason those goods were able to be produced so cheaply has to do with the costs of labor and of the raw materials. The number one driver of industry across the world, not just in the United States, was cotton. Thanks to a large slave population and a favorable climate the United States rapidly became the world's leading supplier of cotton. If you bought a cotton shirt in England or Germany, the cotton used to make that shirt was almost certainly cultivated, harvested, and cleaned by slave labor. The economic activity generated by cotton cultivation touched almost every area of industry and finance. Enslaved people generated billions in capital that was used in part to construct the metropolises of northern cities like Chicago and New York. As important shipping and transit hubs companies in cities like these benefited tremendously in documented material ways. 

Now granted without the abolition of slavery we would not be living in exactly the same world; it should go without saying that slavery's abolition is a significant turning point American and world history. However, the idea that Industrialization and slavery are incompatible is a false one. If the kings of industry had been allowed to use slave labor to operate their factories they would have most assuredly done so. The general attitude of management towards labor during this time was one of grudging cooperation at best and open hostility at worst. Let us not forget that factory owners would often prefer to hire women and children to man their machines for the simple fact that they could get away with paying them criminally small wages, nor should we forget the existence of company towns in which the entire economy was controlled by a corporate interest. The only thing stopping an Industrial Slave Revolution were the laws of Northern States, and the Civil War itself. 

When the Southern States seceded from the Union, their hope was not simply to maintain their slave holdings and continue their way of life. Many in the Confederacy envisioned a vast slave empire that stretched from the Southern United States and across Mexico and Central America. This expansion would have been fueled by the adoption of Northern industrial practices and technology to greatly increase the amount of cotton that could be cultivated and processed. Remember that it was not until the invention of the Cotton Gin, and its subsequent refinement and perfection, that American Slavery reached the apex of its economic productivity. 

All of this is to say merely that the modern world, if we take modern world to mean one of technology and convenience, does not exist in spite of slavery, but rather because of it. Even today large portions of the world economy are driven by virtual slave labor. Much of the cotton used in textile mills around the world is produced by criminally underpaid workers, and is assembled by similarly underpaid workers, the workplaces of which are virtual carbon copies of American and European sweatshops that characterized the early industrial age. The rare-earth minerals that made advanced computers and the information age possible are extracted from places in Africa and South America that often have virtually no actual protections for their workers. We tend to think of slavery as a relic of the past because it is no longer directly visible to us, but it is still a pernicious problem in many places all over the world.

&gt;Once we recognize super-spreading as a key lever, countries that look as if they were too relaxed in some aspects appear very different, and our usual polarized debates about the pandemic are scrambled, too. Take Sweden, an alleged example of the great success or the terrible failure of herd immunity without lockdowns, depending on whom you ask. **In reality, although Sweden joins many other countries in failing to protect elderly populations in congregate-living facilities, its measures that target super-spreading have been stricter than many other European countries. Although it did not have a complete lockdown, as Kucharski pointed out to me, Sweden imposed a 50-person limit on indoor gatherings in March, and did not remove the cap even as many other European countries eased such restrictions after beating back the first wave.** (Many are once again restricting gathering sizes after seeing a resurgence.) Plus, the country has a small household size and fewer multigenerational households compared with most of Europe, which further limits transmission and cluster possibilities. It kept schools fully open without distancing or masks, but only for children under 16, who are unlikely to be super-spreaders of this disease. Both transmission and illness risks go up with age, and Sweden went all online for higher-risk high-school and university students—the opposite of what we did in the United States. It also encouraged social-distancing, and closed down indoor places that failed to observe the rules. **From an overdispersion and super-spreading point of view, Sweden would not necessarily be classified as among the most lax countries, but nor is it the most strict. It simply doesn’t deserve this oversize place in our debates assessing different strategies.**

The *actual* TL;DR is that the overlooked variable of *k*, which roughly equates to dispersion, could be used to inform policy decisions intended to keep us safe.

You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.


President Donald J. Trump: (50:32)
I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management.

lack of management? so trump basically shot himself in the foot because he is the one supposedly managing these wildfires.

Couple this with conditions of extreme strife (revolution, genocidal war, civil war, total international hostility, incessant foreign attempts to undermine the government, the constant threat of apocalyptic conflict, and on and on and on), under which *any* and *every* society would become harsher, more violent, and less willing and able to take risks in the form of leniency towards perceived threats, and the existence of at times brutal state repression is entirely predictable and unsurprising. It has no specific connection to the political colour of the movement, the government, etc. Look at the extremely brutal, violent repression in France during the Reign of Terror, or prior to that the utter blood-drenched character of the English Revolution: the bourgeoisie did exactly as the proletariat has, if anything they did worse.

This has to be one of my biggest/longest projects, just putting the skeleton down took me a while. After I asked what peoples favourite Ace race theme was, city won out, so that was the theme.

Inspiration/References:

Spider-Man PS4 and Trilogy (Toby Maguire FTW)

Objective:

Create a map with good flow and design 

Allow new players to navigate and perform well

Provide shortcuts for later games or risk takers

Have fun with visual gags and Easter eggs

Allow multiple paths that reward difficult areas and punish failures(not by much), this creates diversity and flow. I have seen MULTIPLE players get stuck on a section eventually going from 15th-20th to 50th to 40th, this should not happen. If there were options for example, a longer-ish water section at the flower jump pads, players have the option to take it in order to continue with the game unhindered.

————-

Yellow wool: Speed boost

Blue wool: Elytra 

Red square: Jump Pad

Orange wool: Mega Jump Pad

———

&amp;#x200B;

1. First players leap off a cloud, representing the old Ace Race map, from there they proceed to do a cloud dropper into the water.
2. From here, participants riptide swim through some speed boosts underwater onto a platform. From this platform they can see that they are in an intertwining canal, where they must navigate through different canals, even jumping from one to another, over houses, like dolphins in order to reach the next section. Some sections of the canal will have speed boosts, some won’t.
3. From here contestants will exit the canal onto an open street, displayed in the picture, and descend into the sewers. They may also see more of the map in the distance.
4. So far the contestants have been split, but now they will be scattered. In the sewer, the path splits into 2. Right and Left.
5. (Right Path) contestants exit the sewer at the base of a large clock tower needing to climb it with an upwards mega jump combined with elytra’s.
6. Reaching the top they must jump out of the clock face, no elytra, and proceed to run across subsequent buildings, sometimes jumping through them revealing small Easter eggs within, if a player were to fall they do not restart, they can continue by running in the ground section through the ground floor of buildings until they reach a bounce pad that may take them up to a building where they can continue jumping.
7. Players on buildings will then slowly converge with players who took the LEFT PATH 
8. (Left Path) Individuals who decided to take this path will exit the sewer onto the street and must run through it in order to progress, speed boosts as scattered on the ground, jump pads are on top of cars. It is also possible to see the players who took the right path by looking right and up.
9. Using the jump pad will take a bit more time but it is a safer bet, whereas using speed boosts will run the risk of bumping into cars or crashing into old lady’s. Slowly both sections converge into one another.
10. After both paths converge they will see the entrance to an underground subway ahead they must descend down.
11. Sections of the tunnel will be broken/cracked forcing players to jump across with bounce or fly with elytra.
12. (Super easy place to put Easter eggs ex: dinosaur frozen in ice)
13. When section is over, a large building can be seen in the distance. Multiple sections of their building contain jump pads, mega jumps and water, disguised as glass. Participants can use ANY path they choose to climb to the top.
14. Observant players can trident THROUGH some sections of “glass” into the building and scale it with speed pads and jump boosts 
15. Finally at the top helicopter pad players will mega jump elytra to different mega jump elytra’s until reaching the cloud and land where 1 lap will be counted. Skilled players can skip the platform and elytra dive-bomb into the dropper saving time but taking massive risks. 
16. (Every mega jump elytra is a checkpoint, I’m a mad man but I’m not evil, BTW watch out for birds mid flight.)
17. Large arrows are around the map making it IMPOSSIBLE to go wrong, like seriously the giant green and red arrow in the sky/buildings

The catch all explanation of mental illness does go some of the way toward creating a rationale for these events but all too often the perpetrators either keep their motivations secret or commit suicide possibly as a final FU to the world.  

Hotels in general and Las Vegas hotels in particular are known for their discretion.  We have evidence of how all of the guns were brought up as he was seen on video with many suitcases making multiple trips to his room.  It may seem obvious in hind sight but seeing someone take luggage upstairs in a busy hotel is almost the most normal thing in the world and even if the multiple different employees working different shifts were to put it together that he was taking a lot of luggage it's not really their business to examine bags or interrogate customers about this kind of thing.  Casino/hotels can turn an blind eye to drug dealing and prostitution happening on their premises because they're not in the business of fighting crime, they're in the money making business and making the guests happy and comfortable is a big part of that business.

Why didn't he use all of his ammunition?  Again this is a question only the shooter could answer but we can look at the Columbine high school shooting and learn something there.  Partway through that massacre the shooters actually got bored with it and gave up on looking for people to shoot.  On one hand we only can sustain an adrenaline high for limited amounts of time and once that wears off you'll feel a crash as your body's parasympathetic nervous system takes over and you'll want to recover from whatever just happened.  We also know that sociopaths have trouble keeping their interest on one thing for extended periods of time and once the fun wears off they will abandon what once fascinated them.  It's possible that Paddock ran out of adrenaline, came back to reality, and feeling the weight of his actions decided that suicide was the best option.  I'm also curious how you seem to know that he originally planned to escape, was there a detailed scheme which he left behind which somehow didn't include his motive?

Debunking ""nice islamic slavery*

Slaves didn't rule over anything.
Slaves didn't have civil rights.
Slaves were treated like objects with no free will.
If a master killed his slave he wouldn't face the same consequences as if he killed a normal man(which in islam is death) he would just have to free another slave or pay a some of money.
Slaves could buy themselves from the master but only and only if the master agrees to it. And the master is the one who sets the price and he isn't obligated to do anything or accept the trade.
Masters can beat their slaves with no consequences.
Masters can rape their slaves with no consequences.
I can keep going on and on but you get the picture.
And muslim slaves were free men and women before muslims conquered their city and made all women and kids slaves and killed most men.

In the book ""Slavery in the Arab World"" written by Murray Gordon, he mentions that the Muslim Arab slave trade in Africa pre-dated the European African slave trade by a 1000 years and continued for more than a century after the Europeans had abolished the practice. 

The Arab slave trade in Africa could be extremely cruel as well. One particular practice was the mutilation of young African boys, sometimes no more than 9 or 10 years old, to create eunuchs, who brought a higher price in the slave markets of the Middle East. The taking of slaves in raids, on peaceful African villages also had a high casualty rate. Gordon notes that the typical practice was to conduct a pre-dawn raid on an unsuspecting village and kill off as many of the men and older women as possible. Young women and children were then abducted as the preferred booty for the raiders. Young women were targeted because of their value as concubines or sex slaves in markets.
