BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] privatiser in chief,"This is already a big week for Brexit. Ministers from the 27 other EU member countries have set the terms for a transitional deal until the end of 2020: that everything will remain the same except for the loss of a British vote, and voice. The only quarrel I would have is that the transition is likely to last longer. But to take phase one of Brexit as a template, it seems very likely that the government will accept the EU’s transition terms.

We also had the leak, to the website BuzzFeed, of the document EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing. This showed that the economy would suffer over the coming 15 years under three scenarios: Norway-style European Economic Area membership (2 per cent lower gross domestic product than otherwise); a comprehensive free trade agreement (5 per cent lower); and no trade deal (8 per cent lower). Every region would be adversely affected, with the biggest hits in the northeast, West Midlands and Northern Ireland, and pretty well every sector of the economy.

It was a great scoop for BuzzFeed, though no surprise to economists. Overwhelmingly, credible analysis shows a similar picture. It also produced the usual nonsense, of the kind that says that if you cannot forecast next year how can you forecast for 15 years? This, of course, is not standard economic forecasting but conditional analysis, which looks at the relative difference compared with the baseline when you introduce frictions into trade with your largest trading partner, reduce your attractiveness for foreign direct investment and cut the supply of EU migrant workers. It sets that against modest gains, only over a very long period, from non-EU trade deals.

As for forecasts, although Britain has been helped by a strong world economy a standard forecast was that the economy would be 3 per cent smaller in 2020 than in the absence of a Brexit vote. That remains on track. Mark Carney says that the economy will be 2 per cent smaller by the end of this year, and that effect will build. The squeeze on real wages has returned, as predicted. That poorer and more unstable future some of us warned of is reality.

As for the government’s response, that its proposed bespoke EU deal is not modelled, it is easy to see where that would fit in, somewhere between the 2 per cent negative effect of an EEA deal (Norway) and the 5 per cent of a trade agreement (Canada).

Anyway, I shall leave people to fight that out, because it is time to come to the defence of our beleaguered chancellor. Some Tories, when they are not gunning for Theresa May, want Philip Hammond to be sacked. His latest offence was to go to Davos and apparently propose such a softly-softly approach to Brexit that it might as well not happen at all.

Any reasonable person reading the chancellor’s speech to British business people in Davos last week — and I suspect that his critics have not read it — would find little to get excited about. It was a clear exposition of the government’s approach, stressing that Britain is leaving the EU, including the customs union and single market. It emphasised, as many Brexiteers do, that Britain and the EU start from a unique position of convergence which should make a bespoke agreement easier to negotiate.

That was the context of Mr Hammond’s red-rag-to-the-Brexiteers’-bull phrase that Britain and the EU would be moving only “very modestly” apart. You would have to be very thick, or very obtuse, not to see what the chancellor was doing. He was reassuring businesses that there would not be a sudden leap into the unknown, over the cliff edge.

“Instead of doing what we’re normally doing in a trade negotiations — taking two divergent economies with low levels of trade and trying to bring them closer together to enhance that trade — we are taking two completely interconnected and aligned economies with high levels of trade between them, and selectively, moving them, hopefully very modestly, apart,” he said. “And so we should be confident of reaching something much more ambitious than any free trade agreement has ever achieved.”

It is a sign of the bonkers approach of some in the Tory party that those words produced calls for him to be sacked. It is not, however, a great surprise. Brexiteers were criticised before the referendum for not having a blueprint for Brexit. More than 19 months on that blueprint is still on the drawing board. Apart from vague talk about flouncing out of the negotiations and trading on World Trade Organisation terms, there is nothing. Tory hard Brexiteers snipe, and in doing so inhibit the prime minister from setting out her Brexit plan. They offer nothing constructive.

Those involved in the process, such as the international trade secretary Liam Fox, know that there is hard work to be done, notably the urgent task of rolling over by March 2019 the roughly 40 trade agreements that the EU has with more than 40 countries, to which Britain is a party.

The chancellor will get on with trying to keep the economy on an even keel while pushing hard for the inclusion of financial services in the eventual deal, to the benefit of both sides. Mr Hammond could never be accused of being a flashy politician. Faced with one of those quickfire interview quizzes, I suspect that he would choose Inspector Morse over McMafia and The Crown over Game of Thrones. The chances of him on Strictly Come Dancing, cavorting gangnam-style like the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, are about as likely as those of me doing so, no chance at all.

But as chancellor, he clearly has the country’s best interests at heart, and is working hard to ensure that they are protected in Brexit. I am not sure that that can be said of many of those calling for his head.

Ayy_1mao,,,"&gt;If they want to have 20% of their employees on break, that's their choice.

That's not acceptable on a project that is being funded by the state.

&gt;I imagine there are huge barriers to entry in that location, and that's why this doesn't happen?

Lets say that a bridge construction project is put up for bid.  Thankfully I habitually take several of my state reps out for drinking and pay them several thousands each month in ""consulting fees"", so ultimately no one else is going to have a chance at this bid.  The only issue is that the state has mandated that there must be at least 3 bids.  While realistically this bridge would cost $80 million to build, and in a competitive market I would probably need to bid $90-100 million, all I have to do is create fraudulent bids under shell companies at $300 and $350 million respectively and suddenly my $250 million bid seems much more reasonable.

&gt;Second, what do you think are the chances Trump or the Republican Congress would enact an anti-protectionist policy like you're suggesting encouraging foreign firms to bid for American projects?

Zero, but I expect to see some kind of legislation for expediting the process.

&gt;Also remember that when we compare US costs with costs in France or other wealthy nations, their governments provide healthcare, education, and many social programs that the US does not. This has to be taken into account when comparing an employee's salary.

This is marginal at best, it costs roughly the same (or more) to hire someone in Europe as it does in the US due to higher cost of living in almost every other aspect.  Education has virtually zero bearing on the salary of 90% of the people working in a construction firm, and healthcare becomes increasingly distributed with larger firms.

&gt;It is important to keep in mind that we still are investigating and working on this system. It is possible that this system will continue to evolve as we develop it, and we will be constantly testing to make sure the system meets our goals and our expectations for a quality experience. This post is an opportunity to share with you our plans for the new system, and respond to questions before the system is far long in the development process.
&gt;
&gt;# Restructuring Worlds
&gt;
&gt;Even though world linking has brought world populations closer together, it is impossible for us to get populations and coverage any closer because the current worlds do not give us the granularity needed to do that. For example in NA, Blackgate has decent coverage across all time zones whereas worlds like Crystal Desert have higher peak times and lower off-hour times. Because world linking isn&amp;#39;t granular enough, we don&amp;#39;t have the ideal link that allows Crystal Desert to have coverage that is similar to Blackgate.
&gt;
&gt;This is why, in the new World Restructuring system, we will remove all players from their current worlds, and make new worlds every eight weeks. This will create more granular pieces, which allow us to avoid situations like the Crystal Desert example.
&gt;
&gt;Since worlds will not exist any longer, the &amp;quot;World Selection&amp;quot; that currently is available in character select will be eliminated, and instead a selection for playing in either North America or Europe will replace it.
&gt;
&gt;### World Creation
&gt;
&gt;The system creates new worlds and assigns them a pre-generated name at the start of each season. We use &amp;#39;season&amp;#39; to describe the time between World Restructuring. We plan on eight-week seasons, which is similar to the current time between links. We will discuss more about seasons later.
&gt;
&gt;World Creation builds teams so they have similar predicted participation, skill, coverage, and language. Team assignment moves players onto teams by calculating the contribution value of a player and using that calculation to distribute players fairly. We plan to track stats like play hours in WvW, commander time and squad size, time of day, and participation levels. The exact stats have yet to be determined and we are open to suggestions of other stats to use in this system. This new system will expand upon the current calculation that uses play hours for linking.
&gt;
&gt;If a player has played WvW before, we will be able to use the statistics from their account to sort them into a new world. The system also makes a world assignment for players who have not played WvW before, when they first begin WvW. Ideally the system will assign a new player to a world on which their friends or guild mates play, thereby making it easier than it is at present for people to play with friends in WvW.
&gt;
&gt;### Playing with Guild Mates
&gt;
&gt;We want to make sure that playing with WvW guild mates is easy in this new system. Guilds will be able to specify if they are a WvW guild. This essentially means the World Restructuring system will consider that factor at the start of each season when assigning the guild to a world. On an individual player level, once a player&amp;#39;s guild has specified they are a WvW guild, the individual player will be able to set **ONE** of their guilds as their personal WvW guild. When World Restructuring happens at the start of a season, as long as you have specified your WvW guild, you will be assigned to the same world as everyone else in your WvW guild, guaranteeing you will be able to play with your guild mates.
&gt;
&gt;### Creating Alliances
&gt;
&gt;We also want to make sure that existing WvW communities can play together in this new system. A WvW guild will be able to invite other WvW guilds to their WvW Alliance. WvW Alliances function as a party for guilds. When World Restructuring happens, the system assigns all members in the WvW guilds that make up the WvW alliance to the same world. These WvW alliances will have certain restrictions on them, such as a finite number of guilds or number of players. Our current plans for alliance size are somewhere between 500-1000 members, and we are still considering the technical and match-making ramifications of the number that we settle upon.
&gt;
&gt;### World Creation Summary
&gt;
&gt;So to summarize world creation: at the start of every season our new World Restructuring system will use recent statistics, based on similar predicted participation, skill, and coverage, to create worlds filled with alliances, guilds, and unaffiliated players.
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/a3c5eWvW\_image1.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The above graph displays an example of what makes up a world under the World Restructuring system. Keep in mind, due to the algorithm used to keep worlds balanced, the number of alliances, guilds, and individual players can be wildly different between worlds, but the participation and playtime should be relatively the same.
&gt;
&gt;# Seasons
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/51132WvW\_image2.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Seasons break WvW into cycles where several matches will play out. The current design for seasons is 8 weeks, but we are open to feedback. Matches are still a week long, so there would be eight matches a season in the above scenario. During the season, we will still be using 1-up, 1-down.
&gt;
&gt;### Stages:
&gt;
&gt;1. **Season**
&gt;  1. Once new worlds have been created and everyone has been sorted onto their WvW worlds, the new season has officially began.
&gt;  2. During a season players can manage their WvW guilds and alliances after reset and through the end of Week 7, but their WvW guild and WvW alliances will not be updated until the start of the next season.
&gt;    1. Ex: If you are playing WvW with Guild A this season and decide to set Guild B as your WvW guild in the middle of the season, you will not be able to play with Guild B until the next season, unless you transfer (more about that later).
&gt;2. **Season End**
&gt;  1. A week before the season ends, that is, during Week 8 in the season, you no longer will be able to manage your WvW guilds or alliances. Your WvW guild and alliances will be locked down at this time.
&gt;  2. Everyone is kicked out of WvW, as they are with every reset. WvW will spin back up, as it currently does after reset, and everyone will now be sorted into their new worlds.
&gt;3. **World Creation**
&gt;  1. Alliances, guilds, and individual players are sorted to be on a world.
&gt;  2. This will happen at the same time as current WvW reset.
&gt;
&gt;# Transfers
&gt;# &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;### Region Transfers
&gt;
&gt;Transferring between regions, from NA to EU, will still exist. We have not determined the costs for transferring but a region selection will be available on the character select screen that will allow transfers.
&gt;
&gt;### World Transfers
&gt;
&gt;We understand that even though this system tries to keep guilds and alliances together, there will be times during the season when people want to change teams. Because of this, there are plans to allow transfers between worlds during a season. This means that new worlds will have size restrictions on them, as they do currently.
&gt;
&gt;Players will be able to select worlds from the WvW panel in game. Worlds that are available for transfers will show up in the new WvW world panel. Worlds can be in these three different states:
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dbcd7table\_WvW.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The cost of transfer worlds has not been determined.
&gt;
&gt;# Transitioning to this System
&gt;
&gt;This system is going to take time to make. As mentioned in the WvW FAQ, part of the reason we did World Linking was because it utilized a lot of existing tech and did not require a considerable amount of time. This allowed us to address the growing population issue quickly, while also being able to address other WvW issues. This new system is going to take considerably more time to make. We do not have a release date, but this is going to require several months of work and it will share resources with any other WvW changes that we work on.
&gt;
&gt;Transitioning to this system is going to be slow and we want to make this transition as smooth as possible. Once this system is ready, we plan to give everyone several weeks to form their WvW guilds and alliances. We also want to give titles related to the worlds on which players currently are playing when World Restructuring goes live. If there are other transition ideas, we would love to hear them!
&gt;
&gt;We will continue with World Linking until World Restructuring is ready to ship.
&gt;
&gt;# Feedback
&gt;
&gt;That was a lot of information and I am sure there are many questions. The team will do its best to answer them. We appreciate any feedback on this system. Your opinions of this system, as well as the community&amp;#39;s response, will be an important part of how we tackle this project.

Depends which country/region you're talking about.

In Europe more than 50% of electricity is renewable or nuclear, for example. We definitely want electric cars.

If you look up trends in solar energy price too, you'll see they are still dropping over time, and some fairly believable calculations say that we'll be generating 90-100% of energy for cars (well, probably everything) by solar in the next 10-15 years.

Fossil fuels are only going to continue becoming more expensive over time if demand stays high, yet renewables and nuclear have the possibility to become cheaper even under growing demand.

lowlandslinda,,,"This article seems very layman-y. I have two problems with it.

The article alleges that Scandinavia's role is ""covert"", yet offers no evidence for that. Maybe it is covert to Americans who think Dutch people live in Denmark, but even as a non-Scandinavian European I already knew that H&amp;M's workers suffer bad conditions, that Norway participated in recent wars, that only Sweden was enthusiastically welcoming to refugees, and so on. 

""The Nordic Model"" is seen as an example for **social democracy**, not for foreign policy. Social democracies are reliant on strict border and immigration control to work. They are in no way capable of taking care of all the refugees in the world or even capable of accepting substantial numbers of migrants. Migrants don't join unions in European countries, do not have law of Jante ingrained in them, reduce social cohesion, and thus reduce the willingness to care for each other economically. Migrants also create proletariats (social subclasses) in the countries they migrate to, thus becoming very expensive to governments, threatening the model. For instance, many of the Turkish and Moroccan migrants that came to Europe in the 20th century weren't even literate in their own language, let alone them having potential to be literate in the European languages. It's pretty hard to provide social services such as health care to people when they cannot read, nor speak well. Mass migration would absolutely be the downfall of the Scandinavian model. Scandinavians know this, which is why there has been a major shift from social democratic parties to conservative parties. Labour party always was the largest in Norway up until 2013.

I also disagree somewhat with the assertion that Scandinavia's social model doesn't apply to their capitalist multinationals.

Hitler did actually have some fairly reasonable claims to the sudetenland, although his plan was probably ultimately to cease and easily bypass the new Czech defenses they built for specifically this scenario his claim wasn't exactly unreasonable from a German perspective just like ceasing Poland isn't unreasonable from yours.

The big difference is that the Soviets had something to gain and Poland was in their sights since the early 20s and probably before. Nobody can really say certainly what the reasons were since both nations were secretive and destroyed documentation of these sorts of events regularly, but it's undeniable that Stalin had either the same or similar plans to Hitler. Work together to cease and divide Poland, then when the time is right and your military was strong enough stab the other in the back and keep pushing.

 Britain was pretty clearly just trying to buy time, and obviously from my western perspective is really the most reasonable thing to happen in the lead up to all out war in Europe.

_Ausencia_,,,"A nota do ENEM pode ir pra 3 coisas: Sisu, fies ou prouni. 

De maneira bem fuleira:
___________________
**Sisu=**

Te permite entrar em federais/estaduais. 


No geral todos podem participar, mas alguns cursos em algumas faculdades reestringem algumas vagas somente para cotistas. 

A maior parte universidades oferecem uma porcentagem de vagas por ele.É como se fosse um vestibular alternativo (por exemplo, você pode entrar na USP pela fuvest ou pelo sisu, mas a maior parte das vagas disponíveis são pela fuvest)


 O funcionamento é simples, cada curso atribui um peso  para cada parte da prova do ENEM e a sua nota final no SISU é a soma de quanto tirou em cada parte do ENEM, sendo que o peso de cada parte pode variar.

(A formula para somar sua nota final é bem complicada, existem simuladores na internet que te ajudam, pesquisa ai ''simulador nota enem sisu'')

**Por exemplo, você tirou 500 em todas as partes do ENEM, mais 300 na redação.**

Pra cursar Fisica na USP pelo SISU o peso de matemática é 2 e o da redação é 1. Pra esse curso, sua nota foi 700

Pra cursar Filosofia, matemática tem peso 1 e redação peso 4.  Pra esse curso, sua nota foi 400

Partindo dai, o funcionamento é bem simples. Com um clique você se inscreve no curso, as notas mais altas ficam com as vagas. Se tem 10 vagas, as 10 maiores notas ficam com elas. 

O termo nota de corte se refere ao ultimo colocado dessas vagas, ou seja cara com a nota mais baixa possível. 
Como isso tende a manter um padrão, se usa essa nota de corte como um parâmetro para o próximo ano. Se o ultimo colocado de 2017 tirou 800, o ultimo colocado de 2018 dificilmente tira mais que 850 ou menos que 780. 
Logo, eu sei que a nota mínima que eu preciso tirar pra estar entre as 10 vagas do sisu 2018 é 800, é o mínimo que vai me permitir ser pelo menos o ultimo colocado. Logo, a nota de corte desse curso é 800.
___________________________________________

**Prouni=**




Um sistema que garante bolsas em particulares, integrais ou parciais (o governo paga parte ou toda a sua faculdade) 

**Só pode participar do Prouni se você:**
&gt; Ter tirado mais que 400 no enem (mais uma vez, use simuladores online pra saber sua nota final)


 &gt; Ter cursado o ensino médio completo em escola da rede pública.
   
&gt;Ter cursado o ensino médio completo em escola da rede particular, na condição de bolsista integral da própria escola.
   
&gt;Ter cursado o ensino médio parcialmente em escola da rede pública e parcialmente em escola da rede particular, na condição de bolsista integral da própria escola privada

Se não atende a esses critérios não pode participar do Prouni de nenhuma forma

**Só pode concorrer a bolsa integral quem:**

&gt; O candidato deve ter renda familiar bruta mensal de até um salário mínimo e meio por pessoa. 


Você soma qual sua renda bruta mensal com essa fórmula:

Valor que as pessoas que moram com você ganham ao todo / número de pessoas que moram na sua casa. 

Exemplo:

Mora pai mãe e filho

Pai ganha 100, mãe ganha 100, filho ganha 100


100+100+100/3= 233 de renda bruta familiar

O salário minimo do meu estado é 800, posso concorrer, é menor que um salário minimo e meio, ou seja, menor que 1200(800+400)

Para saber quanto é o salario mínimo, pesquise por estado ""salario minimo sp""


**Só pode concorrer para no máximo bolsa parcial quem:**

&gt;Para as bolsas parciais (50%), a renda familiar bruta mensal deve ser de até três salários mínimos por pessoa.




Mesmo esquema, mas sua renda bruta tem que dar no máximo 3 salários mínimos.   




Partindo disso, o quanto de bolsa que você vai ganhar depende da faculdade, cada um tem um critério praticamente.

FFS, if it wasn't for the weather, I'd seriously consider UK/Ireland or Germany/EU.  This is worst case scenario in a lot of ways for the UK; the horror of the bureaucracy.  That's the best they can sling at us.  My wife's family is all in a UK decaying steel town reminiscent of Rochester or Toledo.  Her parents make about a pound over minimum working an entry position at a coffee packing company.  They rail about non-English speaking peers and voted for Brexit.

Biggus_TM,striker,,"**1) How long have you been on reddit?** 3 almost 4 year's.


**2) Why do you want to be a mod here?** BDO is my main game, and even when it's not I browse this sub numerous times a day because I like to read up on the latest things. I would love to give back and help the community.


**3) Do you have any previous moderation experience? If so:** Yes but not on reddit.


**3a) Biggest sub you modded, and how many users?** I own the Foreigner sub but it is essentially just for posting their music videos so just 5 people. Site I moderated had 50,000 active users in the forum with 100,000 person traffic a week.


**3b) How long have you been a moderator?** N/A


**3c) What were your responsibilities?** I was the sole curator, meaning I archived dead threads, cleaned up drama, as well as deleted rule breaking threads and took action on those that did so. I was essentially the only moderator with full admin access without being an admin on the site.


**3d) Experience with toolbox?** No but willing to learn.


**4) Timezone?** Est and am on throughout the day 10 a.m to 11 a.m


**5) Any experience with the following: CSS/Automod** No, but again willing to learn.


**6) What ideas do you have to improve the sub?**  Honestly the sub has mostly everything it needs. The only real thing I can think of is improve the wiki by generic class skill guides. As well as an optimal gearing guide. I also think a low effort post rule needs to be made. As well as allowing the deletion of answered question posts to clear up some junk.


**7) How would you react to a situation where an exploit is discovered in game and is quickly being spread throughout the forums and subreddit? How would you react to the witchhunting that follows, whether there is evidence to support the accusation or not?** It depends on who the person exploiting is. If it is a public figure like a streamer that puts themself out there, and there is clear evidence supporting this person I don't thing censoring is the right thing. Mainly because they choose to be in the spot light and need to be held to higher standards. If it is a random person no matter the evidence the thread should be locked and direct the poster to the correct people to deal with it.


**8) Some new items and locations from a future expansion are revealed in a major leak. The devs message you requesting that all leaks be removed from the sub. How do you respond?** This is a tricky question. Some subreddits have close relationships with the games developer to the point where they get incentives for helping with the sub. If that is the case you should remove the leaks because you have a working relationship. If that is not the case and there is no prior arrangement then there is no reason to remove the links.


**9) Anything else you want to say?** While I do not fall under the European time zone, I am on all day. I am a full time student and have access to my laptop during all class. So I am essentially on and browsing from 10 A.M Est-11:00 P.M Est. Sometimes earlier sometimes later. While I have yet to moderate any Reddit community I think I would be a great fit from my previous moderation position, and would love the chance to give it a shot. I also want to emphasize even when I take a break from BDO I am always active on the sub reading and sometimes responding to posts. It is one of the few games I care about while not actively playing.

Also I didn't mean literally, I just use shame as a choice of words to describe how it feels to be a mother that gets nagged about how breastfeeding is like sex. Which can be annoying to some people that aren't that sensitive to nudity, or don't believe breastfeeding to be wrong, also funny thing is that Europe actually has nude beaches where people actually walk around naked.

Look dude, I think you just have to accept it. We can't make all women pump feed because not all women can do that. And it's not right to dictate what all women can't or can do. Do you ever wish you weren't so sensitive to nudity? I get that this ain't Europe, so we can't just completely get rid of the idea of indecency. However there should be exceptions such as when a baby needs to eat or when they're prepubescent. 

Also because you seem to really dislike nudity, like just a bare naked male chest would be off putting to you. I've found that looking at yourself naked or regular pictures of naked people (not pornography). Kind of helps to desensitize yourself because although it's still weird to look at, it starts to become just another body part. But it's your choice to desensitize yourself, not mine. It's also a mother's choice to breastfeed and not anybody else's.

“There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,” Trudeau said, concluding that he sees Canada as “the first post-national state.”

Even the New York Times called the suggestion “radical.”

aristotle_of_stagira,,,"This has the potential to be a good discussion, since you are really interested in the topic and not an ideologue, which is rare in the discussions surrounding the topic online.

I am kind of busy currently and I have some deadlines due so I might come back a week or so later to build up on several misunderstandings that dominate this topic because of the disconnect it has with actual biological research (look up papers on the genotype to phenotype map if you are interested), which is because most of the arguments come from behavioral geneticists (who are not geneticists or biologists, rather they are clinical psychologists in training) and political scientists.

So let me briefly reply.

&gt; There's a purely instrumental sense in which I certainly can: if we are going to bet on IQ of a random American citizen being above/below 95, and I'm allowed to know their folk race (and only that), and you're not, then I'm going to rob you blind. And if you object about nature vs nurture and proxies for poverty, then we can bet on adoptees' IQ, and I get to know their race and you get to know their adoptive parents' socioeconomic status, and I will rob you bliiiiiind. I hope we agree on this fact?

When I say proxies for phenotypic differences there, I should have clarified in retrospect, what I mean is as a proxy for their genetic potential (whatever that means, I would say innateness but there are [issues](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1563/436) with using such terms that cut right through the current consensus on the false dichotomy of nature vs nurture, related to the literature on genotype to phenotype map), rather than the phenotype in itself. I completely agree that race as a social variable has predictability on the distribution of intelligence as measured by IQ tests, but it doesn't follow that this phenotypic difference is the result of their evolved genetic differences. 

And this gets to the crux of the issue. Race is more of a social variable than it is a genetic one. This is not even up for debate. The vast majority of population geneticists would agree to that, and I hope you would agree to that too (even if you do think that the IQ difference might be genetic; those statements are not contradictory). Thus, when you are using race as a genetic variable, it is strongly confounded by social factors. 

You can try to control socioeconomic status all you want, the outcome depends on how you define socioeconomic status. But in any case, IQ correlates with socioeconomic status so controlling for it properly will reduce the IQ gap. But the thing is that this is circular. Even Herrnstein and Murray in the Bell Curve go on to say that:

&gt;  We can already hear critics saying, ""If only they had added this other variable to the analysis, they would have seen that intelligence has nothing to do with X."" A major part of our analysis accordingly has been to anticipate what other variables might be invoked and seeing if they do in fact attenuate the relationship of IQ to any given social behavior.
...
At this point, however, statistical analysis can become a bottomless pit

Clark Glymour has a [nice paper](http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/what_went_wrong_reflections_on_science_by_observation_and_the_bell_curve.pdf) on causality and the Bell Curve.
In any case, in both economics and sociology, it has been mainstream for decades that socioeconomic status alone misses a lot of things like cultural transmission mechanisms, etc.

Most of the rest of your comment is based on the above misinterpretation (I should have been more clear I guess). I make no arguments about ontology in any way.

Let me elaborate on the predictive validity of race as a genetic variable. Race is commonly used as a proxy for continental ancestry. But self identified races are extremely [heterogeneous](http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929714004765/pdf) even as far as continental ancestry goes. African Americans range from 100% sub-Saharan ancestry to less than 10%. Further, continental ancestry in itself is a crude proxy for actual human genetic variation. Continental ancestral groups are *not* types, they include very genetically distant ancestral groups. This is not a matter of ontology at all. It's a pragmatic approach to understand human genetic variation and how it relates to phenotypic differences. 
So my point was that in order to have an intuition about expected genetic differences between races you need an evolutionary genetic model for the trait. We know that for the most part selection pressures have been local, not at a whole continental scale. We know that neutrality, which can be a proxy of divergence, results in very subtle differences between groups and huge differences within them. So build a model for your trait to gain intuition. (Spoiler alert: for intelligence if you build a model it shows a slight tilt for lower intelligence in Europeans compared to Africans.)

And this goes back to your example of adoptees. (edit: [interestingly](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6203/7fcba9c327f484f2aeb28aff64bc5f8f2858.pdf) this review of transracial adoption studies seems to report no effect of race as a variable, though the author admits that the datasets are noisy and scarce) You think that you can bypass nature vs nurture via controlling socioeconomic status of adoptive parents, this couldn't be further from the truth. Nearly all race disparities in America exist even if you control for socioeconomic status, even the ones that are not correlated with IQ. This is nothing new. The fact that controlling for socioeconomic status doesn't erase the disparities is not something intelligence researchers just discovered, it was known all along. 
And all this relates to the complexities and non-linearity of the genotype to phenotype map (significantly studied currently in biology with really amazing literature as far as evolutionary biology goes) and to [how](http://sci-hub.la/10.1002/ajpa.20983) race becomes literally biology as an embodiment of social inequality.

&gt; This means that your incorrect worldview supports policies wasteful for the society and harmful to minorities themselves, because if you want to be biased in favor of minorites you still have to be at least somewhat in touch with the reality, if you aren't then your policies will backfire more often than not, for example by disproportionately excluding low SES minorities or causing high drop out rates (further reading).

I am not in support of affirmative action so there's that. I am not aware of the literature about it, so I cannot really comment on this. I completely agree with the fact that we need to have policies based on empirical facts.

&gt; Furthermore, given the worldwide resurgence of racism and fascism, I don't think that fighting it with bullshit is a good idea, because that's going to push everyone who sees through it if not straight into Nazi clutches but definitely away from your side. And you're disproportionately pushing away more intelligent people which is even more dangerous.

I am not fighting anything with bullshit. I am trying to dispel common misconceptions.

I have explicitly said before that the debates about IQ and race are besides the point because it's like arguing with rapists whether rape is in human nature or not. Or arguing with serial killers, whether them being who they are is in their DNA, therefore they are justified and should be allowed to do what they are doing.

&gt; And the second main thing bothering me is that by framing the discussion this way you tacitly accept the Nazi core premise, that if the clustering had ontological merit then it would be OK for them to discriminate, enslave, genocide.

See above why this is not true. I couldn't agree more that arguing about discriminating people based on their race is akin to arguing about legalizing murder or rape and it's out of the discussion.

&gt; As I said in my first comment here, I understand perfectly why are you doing this: moral theories can't be defended with empirical facts so you are wary of having to defend yours, but on the other hand there are all those empirical facts that seem to allow to render the whole point moot. Except not really, so you're opening yourself to trouble if the nazis say that they don't care about ontology and are perfectly content to have their white ethnostate if that means that they and their friends are in and enjoy lower levels of criminality (note that worse, that doesn't even have to rely on biological determinism at all!), or if they find a passable ontology here or in other social spheres, or when people notice that this is sort of a bullshit argument as per above.

And as I said above, I am not. I am trying to dispel common myths perpetuated by racists (and popularized by scientific racists) that try to use sciencey words to borrow the cultural authority of science in order to justify their actions. Not only their moral philosophy is repugnant, but their empirical outlook is invalid (at least currently).",True,0,1517465736,,1517642951,0,dtk6wy6,False,t3_7tt64p,t1_dtim51o,/r/Drama/comments/7tt64p/jeanfrancois_gariepy_jf_vs_geneticist_from/dtk6wy6/,1518816957,3,False,Drama,t5_2rd2l,public,

Absolutely *disgusting* - pissing in streets, loud, uncouth mannerisms, RUDE ""lad types"", drinking until falling down, dress incredibly TRASHY (especially the over tanned women), have sex with anything that moves...no, we're known as Europe's least favourite holiday-goers (a title we've always placed first in) and it is well deserved. It makes me highly embarrassed. Painful, just *painful*

**Germans** and **Aussies**. One thinks no end of their country or themselves, act highly entitled and believe it is their business to know everything about American politics and where you stand on them. Often blunt to the point of extreme rudeness as well. As for **Aussies**, again - think no end of themselves, cocky and arrogant. They have this holier-than-thou attitude to America (despite sucking up all aspects of said American culture) and the white/white passing ones can be highly racist. 

**Indians** No manners, rude, do no understand the concept of waiting for your turn. Older Indians especially are unfriendly, can be racist to blacks/other Indians and generally have no sense of personal space.

EmotionalChainsaw,,,"To add my two cents

1. The Blade Itself is the first book in a trilogy of three books. Then three standalones.

2. It is a military story, an adventure story, a comedy, a drama... it's hard to classify. It's got everything. Book two involves a huge quest of some of the most well written, best characters in fiction. The standalone's are broken down into three types of books, as quoted by the author. Best Served Cold is a thriller, The Heroes is a military/battlefield type story and Red Country is a weird mix of the medieval Europe and American Western, and it works very well.

3. There are a race of monsters that are mixed throughout the series but that's pretty much it for monsters and beasts. There is a very powerful magical artifact that the story centers around quite a bit, a couple characters have the ability to cast spells and there is low key magic but it's very realistic in it's use.

Overall, it doesn't matter what you are really looking for or hoping for. I promise, if you read these books they will be some of the best fiction you've ever read in any genre. You'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't. And I highly suggest you listen to the audiobook versions.

Fear of humans was really important for the survival of the species. The reason Africa has so much more megafauna is because they evolved alongside humans and had time to evolve a fear of us. Our progression from the middle of the food chain to the top took 100'000s of years. 

But the Mammals on Australia and America didn't have that luck. We arrived there in an instant. Why should they fear this little two legged thingy?

Look at the percentages of megafauna we drove to extinction on each continent between 50'000 to 2000 years ago:

* In Subsaharan Africa, 8 of 50 (16%) genera of mammalian megafauna were driven to extinction.
* In Asia, 24 of 46 (52%)
* In Europe, 23 of 39 (59%)

What a melodrama. Oh, so you won't consider or mention Flash Gaming as a representative of China because it doesn't fit your pointless narrative, right? Actually, at this point I'm not sure what the narrative is.

The article is a prime example of titlegore. The author goes on a tangent about how to keep gamers entertained at an eSports event. There is a slight digression about a Trump fan (yawn, so one person is annoying) but it feels pointless and the author talks about photo booths (?). The overarching point here is that main entertainment comes from the US Air Force sponsor.

&gt;The fandom for Counter-Strike does seem to be predominantly American.

False. It's likely plurality European, and this is reflective in viewership statistics but nice try.

&gt;The arena’s attendees also looked a lot whiter and dudelier

Can you get to the fucking point?

&gt;I don’t have a full ethnographic breakdown of who attended the event, but I can tell you that the line for the women’s bathroom never exceeded a five-second wait time.

Same at TI and every major, Dota or CSGO, I've been to. Are you sure you know what you're talking about? Now you're ranting about gender and haven't gotten to the point.

Or ignore it and watch the game. Look, as a non-American I also found the Air Force sponsorship weird and oddly targeted to a vulnerable, young, and impressionable demographic likely predisposed to joining the Armed Forced. But what you're complaining here boils down to a few things: you feel lack of inclusion, you don't like a sponsor, and you found a few fans annoying.

They knew they were actively _developing_ one, and it was only a matter of time. They knew that Stalin, at least, was ruthless and ambitious dictator, who had demonstrated his willingness to wage total war. They knew that communism had as an explicit, stated goal the elimination of capitalist societies. They had just led the US in a catastrophic total war against different enemies, both of whom were also totalitarian countries who were hostile to democratic, capitalistic societies, both of which started far behind the US and UK, and then built up their forces and attacked like clockwork--one of them for the second time in as many generations.

War must have seemed absolutely inevitable to some of the generals, and not without reason.

Now, _in that context_, can you see how they might have thought ""we should get this over with now, while we still have a major advantage""?

&gt; Regurgitator are an Australian alternative rock band from Brisbane, Queensland. The band was formed in late 1993 by core members Quan Yeomans (vocals, guitar, electronics) and Ben Ely (vocals, bass, electronics). Martin Lee played drums until departing in 1999 after recording ...art and the subsequent tour. He was replaced by current drummer Peter Kostic (Front End Loader, Hard-Ons). The band also featured Seja Vogel (Sekiden, Seja) on keyboards and backing vocals from 2006 to 2010; and was featured on their album Love and Paranoia. She also accompanied them on the Retrotech tour and various one offs when suitable.   The touring band has also been supplemented by various extra players over the years the most notable being their first additional keyboardist Shane Rudken (Ponyloaf, Emporium) for a few years in the late 90s.

&gt; They have released numerous EPs and albums that they have recorded in dubiously idiosyncratic scenarios: Tu-Plang (1996) in the remote jungle outside Bangkok; the triple platinum selling Unit (1997) in a condemned Fortitude Valley warehouse as wreckers waited outside; …art (1999) in a sun soaked Byron Bay beach house lapping up the waves; Eduardo &amp; Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks (2001) in the thick cigar smoke of Andy Gill’s London lounge-room; the post Warner release of Mishmash (2004) done in a glass box in Federation Square as part of the disturbing Band in a Bubble parody of reality shows and it’s way before it’s time multiple streaming media mayhem; Love and Paranoia (2007) in a bullet riddled studio in Rio de Janeiro under the looming rock arms of Corcovado; SuperHappyFunTimesFriends (2011) in their home studios over a period of 3 weeks sparked after a debate about whether what they were doing constituted an album; to their most recent and possibly final twisted piece of mangled pop culture Dirty Pop Fantasy (2013) recorded high in an Hong Kong skyscraper and then mixed on the streets of Melbourne… all of this long with their first 2 EPs (Regurgitator and New), the Olympic induced Crush the Losers, the manic EPs Bong in my Eye and Distractions… and the Warner destroying Jingles compilation (2003). 

&gt; In the past 20 or so years they have toured all over Australia, New Zealand, Japan, UK, Europe, USA, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Laos and other parts of Asia. Late 2009 they played a small festival in the Japanese Alps with Hoodoo Gurus… before working with dance choreographer Gavin Webber on the live music/dance/theatrical project Rock Show at QPAC in Brisbane. In 2010 they performed a highly successful live soundtrack to Japanese anime film AKIRA at Sydney Opera House. They then decided to give up the album style of approach announcing they would just release tracks… with a batch coming out under the title Distractions as they toured Australia, played festivals and took off for shows in London, Dubai and Bahrain… returning for Festival of the Sun in Port Macquarie. 2011 started in Brisbane with a huge two night flood benefit show and a massive 3 song set at the Brisbane Soccer Grand final that they won in an exciting penalty shoot out. The seventh album SuperHappyFunTimesFriends released on vinyl, cassette, download and a playable badge (playbutton) which set them off on a trajectory of touring – the sold out national Annual Sail tour with NZ guest Disasteradio - possibly their most enthusiastically received tour and release for some years. Regurgitator’s UNIT was voted #10 on the Triple J Top 100 Australian albums coincided with performances of the album “UNIT” over Falls &amp; Southbound festivals for the end of 2011. 2012 kicked off with the Big Day Out tour – their 6th time around - plus performances at the Margaret River Surf Classic, Red Deer Festival in Qld before touring seminal albums Tu Plang and Unit – The Retrotech2012 tour (with special guests from Indonesia Senyawa and China Hedgehog) was highly successful with the majority of shows sold out. Following this with the hot spot on the sold-out 2012 Meredith Music Festival. 

&gt; The past few years have seen Regurgitator do some superfluous shit. It’s all pretty interesting – the costume changes, the gimmicky record and release strategies, the full-album live sets – but tonight they achieved something far more pure. In straight power-trio formation (no spandex onesies, no heavy metal wigs), they performed what could well be the set of their careers. Hearing thousands sing along to I Will Lick Your Arsehole never gets old. They’re a punk band at heart, and one of the finest this country has produced. (Beat Magazine Dec 2012)

&gt; In April 2013 they headed out on the rural Groovin’ The Moo festival tour and released album #8 Dirty Pop Fantasy September 2013… followed with national Dirty Pop Tour with guest from Portland Wampire… ending up playing their last show for who knows how long as part of a short Asia tour in Beijing mid December 2013 with friends New Pants.

&gt; TONEDEAF: “You might not even be aware of your inner dark pop fantasies, but Regurgitator’s sensational new opus will definitely awaken them. In 2013, Gurg’s raw authenticity is still in perfect condition” 8.5/10
BEAT MAG: Dirty Pop Fantasy soaks up forty years of pop from Austin to Zurich, wringing out familiar tunes strained of cliché. They're winking at you going ""Your kiss like a Caramel Twix,  sweeter than a Kinder Surprise”. The 'Gurge’s Dirty Pop Fantasy isn't simply a label – it's their bony fists banging like a gavel, demanding your ear. The nature of their fantasy is irrepressible! 

&gt; Never ones to compromise or shy away from the unusual, the untried, or any genre that infects their creative sensibility… more than ever they find themselves extending the vitality of their live performances, continuing to infuse them with exuberance, mania and their mashedup motion of rock, punk, electro, funk, pop, where it goes vibes.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Barbary slave trade**

The Barbary slave trade refers to the slave markets that flourished on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, which included the Ottoman provinces of Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania and the independent sultanate of Morocco, between the 16th and middle of the 18th century. The Ottoman provinces in North Africa were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but in reality they were mostly autonomous. The North African slave markets were part of the Arab slave trade.



European slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to the Netherlands, as far north as Iceland and east into the Mediterranean.

&gt; ""And that's precisely what the European Union, in my view, should be doing its best to undermine"" 

I'm not sure 'be more like the United States and stop fostering a view of difference from others' is the same as advocating for unlimited migration to satisfy diversity, but rather encouraging an openness to diversity so that 'migrants can choose states', rather than states control its people. 

That may be semantics, but it think one point is the suggestion that people are saying we need to satisfy diversity like some religion (and therefore we must have immigration) and the other is saying that we should be open to diversity,  to help with migration, to empower people.

_yozmo,bucuresti,B,"Toata lumea iubeste ING, sa iti zic de ce eu ii urasc.  
  
Au cea mai proasta interactiune cu clientul cand te duci in banca. Daca ai nevoie sa faci o operatiune in banca, n-o sa poti sa te duci la ce banca vrei, ci la cea la care ti-ai deschis contul. Desigur, exista posibilitatea sa-ti schimbi banca la care esti alocat, dar sunt situatii in care e nevoie sa te duci de 2 ori sa iti rezolvi o treaba. Pe langa asta, au niste angajati foarte nesimtiti.  
  
Acum sa-ti explic concret pataniile mele cu ING.  
  
Acum 2 ani am avut nevoie de un credit de nevoi personale. Am ales sa incerc la ING, intrucat toata lumea o lauda. Nu aveam nevoie de multi bani, aveam salariu decent (IT cu ceva experienta, deci nu salariu de junior). M-am dus frumos la ING, am deschis un cont, am depus cererea de facut credit, fast forward cateva zile mai tarziu, cerere credit neacceptata. Am intrebat motiv, raspunsul a fost ""Nu putem sa va spunem. Nu ma lasa sistemul sa vad de ce."" Incercat la mai multe sedii ING, la niciunul nu mi s-a dat niciun minim detaliu. OK, dupa ce am facut credit la alta banca, am vrut sa imi inchid contul la ING. M-am dus la un sediu random (cel mai aproape de mine, cel de unde mi-am deschis contul era departe, era langa locul de munca precedent). Normal ca nu s-a putut. M-au trimis inapoi unde am deschis contul. M-am dus si l-am inchis acolo. Fun.  
  
Anul trecut am vrut din nou sa imi deschid cont la ING. Dus la un sediu random, nu se poate, trebuie sa va duceti unde ati avut cont prima data. Dus la alt sediu, la fel. (Le e lene sa te transfere de la sediul vechi, desi pot. Le e mult mai usor sa te trimita acolo.) Pana la urma mi-am deschis cont.  
  
Alta patanie: Urmand sa plecam din tara, am fost cu prietena la bancomat sa scoatem ceva lei sa-i schimbam in euro. Ea are cont tot la ING. Am vrut sa scoatem de pe cardul ei. Blocat card in bancomat. Era ora 7.30 seara. Am sunat la call center (dupa ce ne-am dat seama cum sa scapam de Maria). Aia incerca sa ne faca sa renuntam si sa ne convinga ca nu ne trebuie cardul. Dupa insistente, ne-a trimis intr-un mall unde ""se poate da un card inlocuitor pe loc"". Acolo surpriza. Prietena mea isi schimbase buletinul cu 3 zile in urma. ""Nu putem sa va dam card pentru ca datele nu corespund."" ""Pai schimbati datele!"" ""Pai nu putem pentru ca e ora 9"". A dat el telefoane, card nu ne-a dat ca n-aveam datele corecte si nu exista exceptie. Prietena se duce la ING a doua zi, undeva la ora 5.45-6.00 pm (banca era deschisa pana la 6.30 pm). Acolo raspunsul a fost ca nu va putem face card ca ""nu aveti datele corecte si nu vi le putem modifica pentru ca nu ne lasa sistemul pentru ca e trecut de ora X"". Am parlamentat cu aia acolo si eu si prietena mea, la care un stimabil angajat al bancii (nu cel care ne preluase pe noi) face remarca sarcastica ""Urmariti firul, domnisoara!"" Deci in conditiile in care noi am patit-o din vina lor (un bancomat care nu era nici macar inscriptionat cu ""defect""), dupa ce ca procedura lor e sa te trimita pe drumuri de 7 ori, el isi permite sa fie sarcastic. Dupa alte parlamentari cu o alta angajata de la alt sediu (""Nu putem sa va facem card aici pentru ca apartineti de sediul X""), prietena mea a reusit sa isi faca card. In total a costat-o vreo 4 zile de dus la banca (in mijlocul zilei, in pauza de masa, pentru ca daca s-ar fi dus seara ar fi primit raspunsul ""Nu putem pentru ca e trecut de ora X"" Pai de ce plm mai aveti deschis?).  
  
Desi dupa toate astea (+ fail-ul ala cand le-a picat sistemul si o zi n-ai mai putut sa folosesti cardurile lor) ii consider niste incompetenti cu angajati nesimtiti, am cont la ING pentru ca homebanking.

Illithilitch,,,"I haven't played any PbtA games really, but I am a big fan and would like to play them.

Overall, I think I have had decent experiences with D&amp;D. I've played with GMs I would consider bad in retrospect but I mostly enjoyed the games at the time. I've played 3.5, 4e, and 5e. Of those, I have enjoyed 5E the least, mostly because in many ways it is similar to 3.5 and I keep getting rules confused. 4E was so fundamentally different I didn't have that issue. I also found that I roleplayed the best in 4E--that may have been the system, or it may have just been the mix of players at the table.

Fundamentally, part of my interest in PbtA is the rule simplicity compared to crunchier systems. I know that is weird coming from a 4E fan, but it's a palate cleanser. I like to play crunchy systems, but I just can't GM them. I'm too busy, and too forgetful. Rule simplicity could also be achieved with OSR games, such as, so far my favorite OSR game (based only on reading), the Black Hack.

Another part of it is that I am honestly getting bored of fantasy not Europe. PbtA provides a flexible, leaner, framework for playing a host of different genres. OSR games seem to be based on emulating early D&amp;D--but if I want a play experience that isn't D&amp;D I'd have to do do work on flavor rewrites and I'm just not that creative. I work at an insurance company, and I honestly like math and computer programming--I can do cool stuff, but sustained creativity is not one of them. Bursts of ideas that peter out I can do, but if I'm GMing I tend to get bored a few games in.

Speaking of maths--you mentioned that in your experience, most gamers who like PbtA have had a less well rounded game experience than is typical for gamers you have met/know. At least that is my interpretation of your post, if I'm off let me know. Has it occurred to you that perhaps the gamers you know may not be a representative sample? 

Further, as far as OSR folks go--for whatever reason I have a preconceived notion that OSR games are older, perhaps more seasoned rpers who might not need/want the tools/advice PbtA provides.

&gt; Stand up. It could help you lose weight.

&gt; A 65 kg person would lose 10 kg in four years by standing instead of sitting for six hours a day

&gt; A new study published today in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology1 found that standing instead of sitting for six hours a day could prevent weight gain and help people to actually lose weight.

&gt; Prolonged sitting has been linked to the obesity epidemic, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Europeans sit for up to seven hours a day, and even physically active people may spend most of the day in a chair. 

&gt; This paper examined whether standing burns more calories than sitting. The researchers analysed results from a total of 46 studies with 1,184 participants in all.  Participants, on average, were 33 years old, 60% were men, and the average body mass index and weight were 24 kg/m2 and 65 kg, respectively.

&gt; The researchers found that standing burned 0.15 kcal per minute more than sitting. By substituting standing for sitting for six hours a day, a 65 kg person would expend an extra 54 kcal a day. Assuming no increase in food intake, that would equate to 2.5 kg in one year and 10 kg in four years.

Abstract

&gt; Background

&gt; Replacing sitting with standing is one of several recommendations to decrease sedentary time and increase the daily energy expenditure, but the difference in energy expenditure between standing versus sitting has been controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine this difference.

&gt; Designs and methods

&gt; We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for observational and experimental studies that compared the energy expenditure of standing versus sitting. We calculated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. We conducted different predefined subgroup analyses based on characteristics of participants and study design.

&gt; Results

&gt; We identified 658 studies and included 46 studies with 1184 participants for the final analysis. The mean difference in energy expenditure between sitting and standing was 0.15 kcal/min (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12–0.17). The difference among women was 0.1 kcal/min (95% CI 0.0–0.21), and was 0.19 kcal/min (95% CI 0.05–0.33) in men. Observational studies had a lower difference in energy expenditure (0.11 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.08–0.14) compared to randomised trials (0.2 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.12–0.28). By substituting sitting with standing for 6 hours/day, a 65 kg person will expend an additional 54 kcal/day. Assuming no increase in energy intake, this difference in energy expenditure would be translated into the energy content of about 2.5 kg of body fat mass in 1 year.

&gt; Conclusions

Hi Reddit, We are Dr Anne Leonard and Dr William Gaze from the European Centre for Environment and Human Health (http://www.ecehh.org/), based at the University of Exeter Medical School. We are here to answer your questions on antibiotic-resistance in coastal waters.


Bacteria that can survive in the presence of medicines (antibiotics) designed to kill them, are termed antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and are a growing threat to human wellbeing around the world. Infections caused by bacteria that survive treatment with antibiotics are difficult to cure, and can even kill people if effective antibiotics aren’t available (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118046-woman-dies-from-infection-resistant-to-all-available-antibiotics/)


Understanding the various ways people come into contact with resistant bacteria can help develop effective strategies to control the spread of resistance. We recently published a study (Beach Bums) on resistant bacteria in coastal waters and the potential for their spread to water users. Finding that surfers, who swallow a lot of seawater when they surf, are at a much greater risk of having antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their guts compared to people who don’t go in the sea indicates that coastal waters could be an important environment in which members of the community acquire resistant bacteria.


We are looking forward to reading your questions and comments about antibiotic-resistance in the environment.

&gt; Because politicians, particularly Tory ones are often pragmatists who are reasonably able to use the lunatics who imagine shit like ""Ban immigrants"" for support whilst not thinking their plans rational or sensible.

And good Tories are smart enough to realise that multiculturalism is frankly disastrous and needs to be curtailed. They’ll also (unlike you) have the wit (unlike you) to realise that ending free movement does not equate to a migrant ban. 

&gt; This is not what was voted on. It may have been the motivation for some, and yes on the fringes were dickheads who ""voted leave to stop muslims coming here"". But even the most mentalist positions on immigration have accepted that we benefit from allowing some.

Racism? Meh, kinda [on the rise](http://www.dw.com/en/poland-racism-on-the-rise/a-36812032). And I don't think I have to elaborate on how they feel about refugees. And over here in the Western part of the Western World we've been quite busy with the #MeToo movement lately, but in Poland they just laugh at that [shit](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/03/poland-no-friend-women). Domestic violence (mostly against women) is declining, but still isn't that uncommon, even though it's supposed to be the lowest in the EU. But when you [dig a little bit deeper](http://news.trust.org/item/20140306164123-i8wuf/), you'll see something quite different... I happen to know a Polish woman who got raped, but couldn't go anywhere out of fear for the one who raped her *and* out of fear for her family, cause she wasn't married, thus not supposed to have sex at all, even though it was without her own consent. Violence in general to settle disputes isn't that uncommon to be more precise.

So, besides ultra-nationalistic, somewhat undemocratic, overly christian and a tad bit corrupt, I'd like to add they're still somewhat medieval in their behavior. Of course this doesn't go for all Polish people.

Yes, they've come a long way (with the help of billions coming from the EU, on which the current Polish government is shitting on a daily basis), but they seem to be slipping away into medieval times more and more these days, especially under the ruling Law and Justice Party, which happens to be hugely popular amongst the common man.",True,0,1517491655,,False,0,dtkj2c0,False,t3_7ugmim,t1_dtkam52,/r/europe/comments/7ugmim/its_almost_impossible_to_get_an_abortion_in/dtkj2c0/,1518822818,10,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

If you're not familiar with it, solarpunk is a science fiction genre wherein humanity has achieved harmony between nature and technology, creating a highly advanced, clean, environmentally friendly utopian society. Numbani from Overwatch is an example.

In this scenario, the German Empire was formed, later absorbed Austria and Bohemia, then evolved into a decentralized, confederal solarpunk society over the ensuing couple centuries. Significant linguistic shifts during this time also resulted in Europe becoming known as Kerovia. Don't ask why. It just happened. Thus the country's name is basically ""The Solar Autonomies of Central Europe"". The idea of Germany fell out of fashion long ago, so they changed to a more geographically-oriented title.

If we factor in the Indian origins of the Romani then we can clearly see that La Vierge Noire or black Madonna who graces churches and monasteries and holy sites throughout the world is in fact the Hindu Goddess of Death: Kali.

In India even in recent times, children have been reportedly sacrificed to the Goddess Kali.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/05/india.theobserver

Ten days ago Sumitra and her two sons crept to their neighbour's home and abducted three-year-old Aakash Singh as he slept. They dragged him into their home and the eldest son performed a puja ceremony, reciting a mantra and waving incense. Sumitra smeared sandalwood paste and globules of ghee over the terrified child's body. The two men then used a knife to slice off the child's nose, ears and hands before laying him, bleeding, in front of Kali's image.
Police in Khurja say dozens of sacrifices have been made over the past six months. Last month, in a village near Barha, a woman hacked her neighbour's three-year-old to death after a tantrik promised unlimited riches. In another case, a couple desperate for a son had a six-year-old kidnapped and then, as the tantrik chanted mantras, mutilated the child. The woman completed the ritual by washing in the child's blood.
Many of the locations where a cult of the Black Virgin exists are also places which are rumoured to feature Satanic blood rituals and human sacrifice. A prime location in particular is the Abbey of Montserrat, some 30 miles from Barcelona which Spanish researcher Alberto Canosa has connected to the high-profile murders of three young Spanish teenager girls, abducted on their way to a disco, and the enacting of Satanic ritual involving some of the most powerful people within the Spanish political and religious elite.

One of the biggest crimes in this satanic monastery happened in 1992, the famous Alcasser girls case! 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alcasser_Girls 

Satanic ritual abuse and children sacrified to madonna ""la moreneta"" still are taken in Abbey of Montserrat (Barcelona, Spain).

Roman Catholic Church is behind of these crimes. People involved in these crimes are bishops,politicians, business men, royal family and bankers from Spain.The children are sacrified in underground caves in Montserrat.

This news can be found in ABC newspaper! a famous spanish newspaper!

Ruiz Mateos, a very controversial business man, paid 30.000 euros every week until paid 600.000 euros to Abad ""Josep Maria Soler i Canals"" . Monks promised him financial successful again in a relatively short time. How? offering child sacrifices to deamons.

These lovely girls were sacrificed in a satanic ritual.Snuff movie cost 50.000 euros in the black market . Miriam had to experience terrible suffering during at least one month before death. The murders are homosexual monks, spanish bishops, catalan and spanish business men, politicians, bankers that some of them become reptilians during these satanic rituals. 

Alberto Canosa and more people are reporting these atrocities. 

Feel free to report it!


These murders were particularly shocking, due to the tortures and sexual assaults inflicted on the three young girls. The girls were abducted on the symbolic ritual date of Friday 13th November.
The Bible assigns '13' the meaning of ""rebellion against constituted authority"", 
plus the depravity that caused Satan to rebel against God.
 
The occultist assigns '6' to represent the number of man, and the number '7' to represent the number of divine perfection. Thus, as a person climbs that ""Jacob's Ladder"" toward self-perfection in the realm of the occult, the number '13' represents the state of divine perfection, self-achieved perfection, and Illumination (6+7 = 13).

http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal20.htm

The supposed murderer Alberto Angles was and apparently allowed to escape and possibly returned to his native Brazil. To add insult to injury the father of one of the murdered girls, Miriam (Mary) was actually sued by the same police force who investigated the case and apparently managed to allow a cornered killer to escape. 

'As yet unfounded theories abound, with many saying they believed Anglés and Ricart were merely the kidnappers being paid handsomely by a sadistic paedophile racket, who also paid them to take the blame for the case.

Those who believe this consider the real killers and torturers were filming their actions for snuff movies and that they were people of extreme wealth or power, influential enough that the Spanish justice system has worked to cover them up and used Anglés and Ricart as scapegoats.

But evidence made public to date appears to show it was a random brutal murder by two men with sadistic sexual tendencies.
Miriam's father was interviewed on the Valencia region's Canal 9 shortly after the girls' murder and spoke out about the cover-up theory involving influential public figures.

He was successfully sued for defamation by the police investigating the case and ordered to pay them 285,000 euros in compensation, which was eventually paid by the TV channel.

The other presumed murderer, Miguel Ricart was sentenced to 170 years in prison but thanks to the European Court of Human Rights he was released in October 2013 and is very much alive and at-large. Possibly because he was a patsy after-all so his early release was secured behind the scenes.

[deleted],,,"Um dos maiores memes da área de T.I. são os requisitos que algumas empresas publicam em vagas de emprego. Em algumas você precisa ser uma mistura de Chuck Norris com Robocop e Goku pra dar conta do recado kkkkkk 

Ao invés de analisar as vagas, analise o que anda bombando no mercado de desenvolvimento. 

Python por exemplo é uma linguagem muito promissora. 

Comece a desenvolver projetinhos próprios, crie um portfólio para testar qual é seu nível de desenvolvedor. 

As empresas hoje em dia preferem contratar um cara que tem pouca teoria mas tem muita prática e versatilidade na hora de tomar decisões do que um cara que estudou muito e não consegue assumir a frente de um problema. Afinal quem desenvolve, assume problemas a serem resolvidos. 

Então meu conselho é esse, coloque em prática tudo que você aprendeu. Seus feitos na área de tecnologia valem mais do que seu diploma. 

E jamais deixe de estudar. Alguns dos assuntos em alta são desenvolvimento para internet das coisas, android, facebook, iOS e segurança da informação. 

Eu estou saindo da área de micro eletrônica computacional para migrar pra área de desenvolvimento. Vou começar a estudar python e fazer alguns projetos para criar portfólio. Você tendo know how, o resto acontece.

ctudor,ROMA,Romania," - /u/kristynaZ, /u/Berenteb,  as far as i am aware Bucharest area is above european mean in terms of GDP PPP

&gt;The region Bucharest-Ilfov is the most developed region in Romania, with a GDP per capita of 131% of the European average.

&gt;Bucharest thus surpasses other European capitals such as Athens, where the GDP per capita reaches 98% of the EU average, Madrid (128%), Berlin (113%), or Budapest (108%), according to an analysis by the foundation Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Romania, cited by local Agerpres.

&gt;However, the rest of Romania has a GDP per capita of only 54% of the European average. The situation is even worse in regions such as the North-East, where the GDP per capita amounts to 34% or the South region, with 41%.

&gt;The over-centralization of the country’s economy in the capital is a particularity of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Nevertheless, no other country in the region records such a big income gap between the capital and the rest of the country.

&gt;In 2012, the average income per household amounted to EUR 6,300 in Bucharest, whereas it reached EUR 2,700 in the South and the Southeast regions.

&gt;The Social Monitor is a project launched by Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Romania, which shows where Romania stands compared to other states for the income difference between the capital and the rest of the country.

ASleepandAForgetting,,,"I get a little weirded out by people who think crates are ""prisons"" and can't accept that different people (and cultures) raise dogs differently. So, a few things.

1. If someone is never away from their house for more than 5-6 hours a day, how can they afford a dog? 

2. If you had a destructive dog that would say, eat through drywall, what would you do with said dog during the day while you're gone? Or if you had a dog with destructive SA, what would you do with the dog while you're away? In both of these scenarios the dogs are appropriately exercised and stimulated, they just have a tendency to destroy anything in sight when not supervised. How would you handle that?

3. Most crates aren't tiny prisons that are just barely large enough to contain the dog. Being able to stand up, turn around and lay down again is the general idea for puppies so that they are less likely to eliminate in their crate. My dogs' crates are 4' x 4' x 4'. In other words, giant. 

4. Do you think it's more cruel to crate a puppy, or to allow it free roam of the house so that it can get into something it shouldn't, resulting in a potentially fatal blockage that will require an expensive and invasive surgery to fix? 

5. You realize that most people in the US choose to stop crating their dogs as soon as the dog reaches adulthood, provided the dog can be trusted to not destroy their home, right? I know NO ONE who crates their adult dogs during the day if they don't have to.

6. You know what my adult dog did during the day when he was confined to his crate while I was at work? Slept. You know what he does now that he's not confined to his crate while I'm at work? He sleeps. *In his crate. With the door wide open.*

Overall, to each their own. I really wish people from Europe (and other 'non-crating' countries) would stop throwing heat towards dog owners in the US for crating. I could throw plenty of heat your way for endangering your puppies by giving them free roam of the house, but I don't, because I simply accept that your idea of risk and what's ""best"" for your dogs is different than my own.

blitZee,,,"As an Ex-Erasmus Mentor, here's a couple of things you might want to know: If you're able to, get an Erasmus mentor. They will (or at least try to) help you get an apartment if you don't want to live in the dormitories (which, unless you're in the Olandų st. dormitory, are in quite bad shape). Even if you're not technically an Erasmus student, you should still be able to get a mentor. Depending on how cool your mentor will be, they might take their time and show you around the city.

Having a mentor is also great since you'll always get reminded about events specifically for exchange students. First week is usually called the Orientation week where there's some sort of an event each day. This week is held to help you ease in into the student life here in Lithuania.

Other things to know in general:
Weather:
From what I've gathered, it's really similar to Canada's weather, but slightly less harsh. Usually not as cold in the winter, less snow, more rain, maybe gets slightly hotter in the summer, but usually it sits around a similar temperature range.

Shops:
As already mentioned, the main 4 shops are Lidl, Iki, Maxima and Rimi. Rimi, Iki and Maxima all share similar quality products, but Rimi is pricier than the other two. Lidl has cheap, ""knock-off"" products (that are actually pretty good), with a small twist: every week they have a different ""X Country Week"", importing some pretty sweet products (and deals) related to that country. Those are the main things to look out for and are always of higher quality than the standard mainstay products.

Transport: Again, like already mentioned, your best bet is to make use of your student discounts. Buses are 5,80 euro for an entire month of unlimited bus trips in Vilnius (during day time, doesn't apply to night buses that are available from 11pm to 3am on fri-sat). Train ticket discounts are also great when you want to travel around other cities. Closest thing to buying a car I've heard was a bunch of students renting a car to travel 'round Europe a bit on their holidays, so look into that once you're here. Traffic jams in Vilnius are actually really bad during rush hours, so I wouldn't really recommend getting a car.

Bars: While I suggest to try out the bars yourself, two of my favourite places are the BIX bar and Mr. Pub. BIX bar has a beer ""stock market"" every Tuesday and Thursday where beer prices start at a preset price, and then it goes up and down with every purchase. When purchasing beer in the ""stock market"", buy some beer in advance (aka more than one pint), since the price applies to the entire purchase and not to a single pint. The second one is simply a cozy place.

I'd probably add more to this list, but I gotta hop off now, so if you have any more questions, wanna possibly hang out when you arrive here or have questions related to studies, just shoot me a message.",True,0,1517498535,,1517498748,0,dtkoxn5,False,t3_7uc48x,t3_7uc48x,/r/lithuania/comments/7uc48x/going_on_exchange_to_vilnius_university/dtkoxn5/,1518825637,2,False,lithuania,t5_2qj20,public,

&gt; Farmers in some places in Carniola – especially near Turjak and there about – are familiar with a rare invention, which I have not seen in any other country; namely, they slide down high hills on snow in winter with incredible speed into the valley. For this purpose, they use two wooden planks, a quarter of an inch thick, half a foot wide and about five feet long. The planks are bent at the front and curved upwards. A leather strap is attached in the middle of each plank into which the foot is pushed; one such plank is attached to each leg. Furthermore, the farmer also holds a hard stick in the hands. The stick is positioned under the armpit and used for support and steering while leaning the body backwards. They thus slide or, I could also say, ski or fly down the steepest slopes”.

Gamblor29,,,"&gt; TIL Jewish Poles, Ukrainians, and Moroccans have an inherently ""longer, more direct, and more continuous attachment to the same land"" than the descendants of Jews who converted to Islam and Christians literally living in Bethlehem whose ancestors had lived there for thousands of years.

Uh, yes, that's exactly it.  The land of Israel is a fundamental part of Jewish religious, national, and cultural identity.  Jews are literally fucking named after the land.

&gt; The Zionist identity was manufactured in the 19th century, like practically every other nationalism.

Nope.  Of course if Judaism is an ethnicity or nationality, it obviously has ties to particular land inherent in the definitions of ethnicity/nationality.  But often anti-semites like to limit Jews to being merely a belief system or religion.  But even then they're brutally, brutally wrong.

Two of the fundamental prayers in Judaism are the [Shema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael#Content) and the [Amidah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah#Structure_of_the_weekday_Amidah).  The text of both of those prayers, recited three times daily by Jews for millenia, revolves entirely around the Jewish people being in and returning to the land which they were exiled form - the land of Israel.  This isn't new, this is really, really OLD. And its been largely unchanged since before Arabs even existed.  So, yes, the attachment is longer, more direct, and more continuous than any converts.

Wait, is your position that the Jews of Europe aren't ethnic/genetic Jews?  The Khazar thing?  You know that the only people who believe that are the crazy died-in-the-wool Jew haters, right?

&gt; You mean settler lives. Their predicament is the product of their social status as settler colonists. Mandela didn't hate white people, he hated settler colonists who were white.

Wait, Jews returning to their homeland are settler colonists, while Arabs with names like al-Mughrabi and al-Masri and little blonde girls named Tamimi are indigenous?  uh okay.  I wonder if you also think that native rights and land reclamations in North America is settler colonialism.

&gt; At least you're honest about wanting to utterly and completely wipe a people from the face of the earth. And it's clear, based on this genocidal imperative, that your allegations of not caring about Jewish lives is pure projection.

HailSatanLoveHaggis,,Treasonous Vegetarian,"&gt;You think an independent Scotland will find £10bn in extra tax revenue in the first year of independence?

Never said that. I'm not dismissing a period of adjustment and reduced spending.

&gt;Both GERs and Brexit reports clarify how much we receive from being part of the UK and EU respectively, and therefore how much we'd lose by leaving them. That's how I drew my conclusion.

While ignoring changes to revenue through control over our own economy

&gt;Such as?

I thought you were supposed to be informed? The Scottish Government has screeds of data outlining Scotland's resources, economy and trading figures.

&gt;That's the real answer.

&gt;You can't be arsed hunting any data out whatsoever. You never did.

&gt;Your belief that Scottish independence is a better option than remaining part of the UK is pure dogma. It isn't based on any figures or research because you haven't bothered to do any.

&gt;Which is why you can't name any of these figures you claim support your position. 

&gt;And the only reports you can think to name are the ones I mentioned first, even though they don't discuss the topics you're claiming to be informed about.


Stale bait. I've read plenty on the performance of the Scottish economy, as have you. The reason I'm not doing it is because you're not interested in reading them. You're trying equate my genuine lack of interest in jumping through your hoops with an inability to provide said data that both you and I have read, and anyone reading this familiar with your posting style also knows you have read. Most people on this board know exactly what you're like. You always do this; ask for clarification on every single little detail in an attempt to paint the person you are debating with into a corner (and to absolve yourself of any responsibility for backing up your own points, beyond one sentence responses and more questions), and when provided with what you've asked for simply ignore it and start questioning something else. That's why I'm not doing it.

You also know that's why you are doing it. If I do it, you'll ignore them and feel smug you got me to search and post, and if I don't you get to accuse me of being an uninformed ideologue. That's why your usual deliberately contrite and obtuse answers became a mini-rant by your standards when you thought you'd got me. You can deny it all you want, but you got a bit excited and showed your hand. We've seen each other discuss sourced figures before. This is pure pantomime on your part, that's why I'm not playing :)

Side note, since you're in Germany - there's been a trend of people producing hypertype Great Danes and passing them off as ""traditional"" Danes, or ""European"" Danes. You might even see some of these dogs in the show ring (although they're more common in France). 

The FCI and AKC standards for Great Danes are nearly identical. There is no such thing as a ""European"" type and an ""American"" type. Well-bred Great Danes should look as much [like this](http://www.gdca.org/images/dogbitch1.gif) as possible (obviously with uncropped years, since you're in Germany).

Breeders producing these types of psuedo-Danes are doing a disservice to the breed. These exaggerated Danes with heavy bone weight are known for having dysplasia and heart problems. 

[This blog](https://greatdanegnosis.wordpress.com/) by Maria Gkinala, a well-known figure in the world of Great Danes, goes into depth about the problems the breed is facing today.

devlifedotnet,,No Party Affiliations. Vote Based on Sensible Policy,"&gt; No need to be condescending, I understand fully ""how the EU works"", that's why I voted to Leave with such relish in 2016. I'd been waiting for 25 years for the chance to vote on it!

Ok, I'm curious, seeing as you seem to know what you're talking about, why are you so keen on leaving? nobody's ever expressed a coherent argument as to why this whole thing is a good idea from a logical or quantifiable standpoint... i mean one beside the general ""we don't like immigrants"" which i think is more ideological than logical (and i think probably less prolific than the media make out to be).

&gt; My point is that when one of the biggest contributors to the EU chooses to leave, they should be flexible if they too want a transition period. If the EU don't want a transition period, fine, we'll leave without a deal in 58 weeks and work from there.

As far as i understand we were the ones who tabled a transition period and the EU have just recently agreed between themselves the maximum length they would be willing to give. For them it is less of an issue because they still have all their other trade agreements in place and their markets would stabilise with the reduction in uncertainty. That's not to say that having a transition deal doesn't benefit them in some ways, but the power in negotiations tends to go to the person most willing and able to walk away. we might be willing, but we are far less able.

But if I've understood this correctly you would rather we just bolt and go straight to WTO rules in March next year? this seems absurd.... you would have to erect a border in Ireland, you would have all flights between EU and UK grounded and we would have zero trading agreements with the rest of the world (which can take anywhere between 3-10 years to negotiate with larger economies). i don't see how that's a good thing?",True,0,1517505114,,False,0,dtkvvaa,False,t3_7uhuc3,t1_dtktinf,/r/ukpolitics/comments/7uhuc3/statement_by_the_pm_that_we_have_got_to_take/dtkvvaa/,1518829031,8,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

The_George_Cz,,,"A lot of problems stem IMO from the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act which forbids the U.S. Government agency from keeping a registry directly linking non-National Firearms Act firearms to their owners.

I was having a hypothetical conversation with some other US gun guy on reddit, here is my theoretical proposal that could satisfy both parties. You could introduce firearm owner licence that needs clean record, medical check and law knowledge and safe handling test like here. The licence needs to be renewed every 5-10 years with just medical being submitted. Possesion and sales of firearms without that licence is now a felony. If you get charged with domestic, DUI or any felony and select misdemeanors (over here it's for example poaching) it leads to you losing your licence and your firearms. That cuts down on the numbers of felons, mentally ill, violent or otherwise unreliable people (like those who like to hit the bottle) in possesion of guns. In order to conduct a private sale, you need to notify your PD and get a permit from them (so that they can run backgroud checks on them), but otherwise, it should be shall issue. OR you could do it through an FFL. 

In turn, what you would gain is nationwide shall-issue CCW with that licence, NFA is repealed, so possesion of SBR, SBS and other fun stuff is now legal with no addition hassle (like it is over here in the Czech Republic), if you wanna take it further, you could also make it so that full-autos are legal to possess if you register them and submit to periodical check of storage. 

Now this is obviously me building castles in the sky, but I just find it fun to theorise about this stuff, as I believe our gun laws are one of the best out there, maybe save for the fact that we can't own suppressors or HP ammo (oh and the EU wants to reduce those rights, which pisses me off and I hope that we can tell them to sod off.

Endrju_Doda,,,"That's not true. The law strictly says ""against the facts"". Facts are defined. Undefined facts are just theories. Polish IPN rely only on facts documented from several sources/documents/witness and they must be in terms of crimes listed in Art 6. of International Military Tribunal signed by all Allies after the war.

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact

if Norman Davies is a historian then all his work is a scientific research and can be verified by documents/withesses or other sources then this law excludes him from any responsibility (Art. 55.p3)
If Norman Davies and his theories are against the facts and it can be proven and he's spreading it deliberately with knowledge that he's lying then then this law applies to him.

This law has one disadvantage because artists are also excluded and everything what this law should protect (including for purpose calling Nazi German Death Camps in occupied Poland as Polish Death Camps) may be called an artistic performance and therefore excluded from penalization. 

This law should be changed a little bit to include written permission for an artistic performance being excluded from this law.  There's no censorship at all in this law.  Truth will always defend itself.

There is similiar law in most of EU countries (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial). Polish law is mostly the same but also includes one major change to protect and prevent suggestions that nazi Geman Death Camps in occupied Poland was Polish Death Camps.  Poles and Polish Jews were slaughtered by Germans and that's the undeniable fact so please do not confuse the murderer with the victim.

The existence of collaborators in Poland can not be undermined because it is a documented historical fact. Another documented fact is that Polish Underground issued a death sentence for all collaborators and there's more than 100 confirmed executions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims#/media/File:WWII-HolocaustDeaths-Pie-All.svg

Please understand that 66% of poeple murdered in Holocaust (including people murdered by Soviets who invaded Poland several days after the Germans) was Polish Judes or ethnic Poles so saying that the camps were Polish is an untruth, a lie, a falsification of history and a violation of the memory of milions murdered people. And that's why this law is so important for Poles.

Title: **International Restraining Order [USA]**

Original Post: 

&gt; Some details are being left vague with respect to location, but here's some background:
&gt; 
&gt; * I am a US citizen living in the US with my wife
&gt; * My wife is a citizen of a Central American country and has just recently moved to the US
&gt; * My wife lived in Europe for a short period of time and met someone from a European country.
&gt; * This individual has been stalking her for nearly a decade
&gt;   - Several years ago, he showed up in her home country looking for her, harassed some of her family members a bit
&gt;   - I believe he came back a second time, but did not have funds to leave the airport and left after staying there a few days
&gt;   - She has not responded to any emails in several years, and basically told him to fuck off and has ignored him ever since
&gt;   - He sends near daily emails to her (several pages of all kinds of nonsense)
&gt;   - He tracks down and follows her online accounts when possible
&gt; * Two weeks ago he showed up in her country again looking for her and bothering her family and coworkers
&gt; 
&gt; We do not believe that he knows she is living in the US, but he does know she is married now and may suspect I am the husband (he has followed some of my accounts online as well) and it would be trivial to find out where I live.
&gt; 
&gt; **Question**: Is there anything we can do, legally, to preemptively prevent him from being able to enter the country or to ensure that he will be immediately deported if we comes to our residence (or any of my family members)? Can we get a restraining order under these circumstances without him ever having been in the country? 
&gt; 
&gt; Any other general advice would be appreciated as well.

I found it interesting that the city was divided by district numbers. He was go to District 5 but stay away from District 8 (don't remember the exact districts). It was so wild and felt like the Hunger Games to me (more like Hungarian Games amirite? sorry).


I also loved all those ""Ruin bars"". I remember one that had abandoned dentist chairs upstairs. It had a very ""Saw"" vibe. The energy and the people there was something special. Everyone was out and about at night especially near that Ferris wheel. A local Hungarian girl took us to get this huge fish along the river (hack?). 


Our hostel owner kept telling us to go to a restaurant named Fritzi Papa. Practically all the restaurants we went to were delicious and cheap. Oh and don't get me started on your city's huge bathhouse. 


I have so many fond memories of Budapest, especially staying out till the sun came up singing songs outside of the bar.

It would be great if someone did a real full analysis like you're talking about for both. But of course that would also depend on the fuel mix of your local power supply which varies.

boomstik101,,,"Oh boy, let me tell you about the time I went to a German rest stop. I was a junior in high school and on my first trip to Europe with a touring choir. We had just landed after a long flight and were on our way to Rothenburg that was our first concert location. We arrive at the nicest rest stop i have ever seen and stop for food. I ordered my food and got a 50 cent euro ticket to be used for the restroom. This is where the adventure begins.

I get through the line to get into the mens bathroom and a woman comes out of the stall. I panicked for a hot second and confirmed there were urinals in the room with me. I had never seen a woman in the men's room before and the thought was nigh unheard of to me. I went into the stall and did my business and the toilet didn't flush. There was a motion sensor on it, but it made the seat rotate and not the water. I tried the motion sensor a few more times in an attempt to make it flush instead of cleaning the seat. 

Desperate to not look the fool, i searched for some sort of button or lever on the walls. There was your standard fare of hooks, handrails and TP rolls, as well as a 1ft square metal placard at eye height that simply read ""STOP"". To my American sensibilities, this looked like a dispenser for toilet seat covers found in most rest stop bathrooms. Besides, I wanted the toilet to GO and not STOP. 

I stood there panicking, cleaning the toilet seat over and over until I decided to start pushing objects in the stall until it flushed. Nothing worked until I pushed the STOP slab and the physical relief I felt in that moment far outstripped my relief of doing what I entered the stall to do.

TL;DR

I couldn't find the button to make the toilet flush because it was a 1ft square metal panel labeled STOP when I wanted the toilet to GO.",True,0,1517507890,,False,0,dtkyvtu,False,t3_7ui180,t3_7ui180,/r/AskReddit/comments/7ui180/americans_who_visited_europe_what_was_your/dtkyvtu/,1518830521,2,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,

Emailed a week ago and I hadn't heard back, so I sent another email voicing my concerns of not being responded to. I got a response back 15 min later. I am really sorry, I thought I got back to you last week. Regarding your first question, the GMP certification process lead by Health Canada is following its course. Prior to the holidays, we had to contact the inspectorate to organize the audits. The audits were then initiated after January 7th because of the holidays. The CTA was resubmitted within the allowed time period and now we are awaiting the audit reports to comply to Health Canadas conditions for approval of the CTA. The process is going well. But I cannot certify how and when Health Canada is going to answer but we expect the approval and phase 3 to begin as planned in Q1 2018. Regarding the event, Tetras team was in San Francisco the week of JP Morgan, one of the busiest weeks for gathering of Investors and Commercial Partners in the BioPharma industry. We met more than 20 companies from Canada, the USA, Europe and Israel, with an equal mix of investors and potential partners. Other key meetings took place through various networking events throughout the week. One thing is clear: people now understand Tetras cannabinoid pharmaceutical business model, how it is different and how it is at the forefront of a revolution in the medical industry. A number of follow up meetings are being arranged, which will contribute to the momentum that has been building over the past six months I hope this answers your questions. So relax everybody like she said it's all going according to plan....just waiting on HC to get back with them. Just wanted to share this while everyone is freaking out. Shares are on sale....so get em while there cheap...peace.

as máquinas de aparar podem ser (linhas philips) ""multigroom"", ""bodygroom"" e ""beardtrimmer"".

* a bodygroom não serve para barbas, em geral tem 2 níveis de altura e tem a cabeça mais larga.
* a multigroom tem níveis de ajuste de altura, cabeça mais larga e lâmina mais resistente, mas, em geral, o suporte é menos robusto e ela é menos precisa para a barba (funciona, mas não é ideal).
* a beardtrimmer é uma máquina com mais ajustes de altura, a estrutura é mais fixa e tem a cabeça menor.

em geral, recomendo a beardtrimmer se vc precisa de muita precisão na barba e se não vai aparar pelos do corpo.

* The Senate is designed so each independent state has equal sway in making laws.

Is factually false. In fact in 1993 a group of independent states implemented something very similar...TWICE in their system. It is called the European Union.

**EU** Roughly how it works

* European Council (heads of states) get together decide what the EU cares about, similarly the national parliaments decide what is important. They throw all this shit at the EU commission with comes up with ideas to be implemented.

...Wait who the fuck is the commission: The commission is technically part of the executive branch, but is basically where laws actually ""start"" in the EU. It is made up of 1 representative per member state (appointed by that state) (insert crying about how a German vote is now worth 1/5 of a Belgian vote). The commission could be semi analogous to the Senate...although the commission is designed to be ""independent"" and focused on the EU as a whole rather than national policies.

* The Commission creates proposals and pushes them to the EU Parliament.

...Who the fuck is the EU Parliament? Parliament members (751 of them) are distributed to states by population (Germany has 96, Belgium has 21). These are elected officials and decided by popular vote in the country (Example if this was how US representatives were elected, Wisconsin would have 13 of the 751 seats, the GOP would have had 6 seats, the Dems would have 6 seats, and Libertarians would have had 1 seat, using the 2016 results (again just an example)).

* So the Parliament debates and either accepts or kicks it back to the commission to try again.

* If Parliament accepts it then it goes over to the council

...Who the fuck is the council? The council has one representative per member state (Germany has 1/5 the representation as Belgium by population rabble rabble rabble). The representative can change depending on the subject of legislation (so usually an expert in their given country for those policies).

* The Council either approves (yay the EU has a new law), or rejects it stating their issues, it gets kicked over to Parliament

* Parliament either approves (yay the EU has a new law), or rejects it and offers amendments and kicks it over to the commission.

* The commission gives their opinions on the amendments and kicks it over to the council.

* The Council agrees with amendments (yay the EU has a new law) or disagrees.

* A committee is formed to try and come to an agreement, they kick the agreement they come to to both the Council and Parliament

* If both accept (yay EU has a new law), if one rejects (yay EU doesn't have a new law).


So there are actually two levels of the EU system that individual states regardless of population have a tremendous amount of sway in the legislative process.


Coming back to the US. It is important to remember that the US is a collection of states that do run things fairly independently outside of issues that affect them all. The Senate is designed to give each state equal power. It does that effectively.

Which brings up the issue again of the House. The House is supposed to be the ""voice of the people"" in all of this, however there are major discrepancies in the voting population and representation.

So the question is why are you trying to argue at fixing something working as intended...when the other side of things is horrendously broken.

Why not fix the thing that is horrendously broken...


Sorry emotional arguments are fucking stupid and:

&gt; Why are people in Wyoming exponentially more valuable than people in CA or Texas?

Is an emotional argument.  In the exact same way that if ALL of our stuff was representative then:

&gt; Why are people in CA or Texas more valuable than people in Wyoming or New Hampshire?

JSlate_,,,"Hello. Ive been a Neocon for a few years now, hope these answers will suffice

1. I think America's enemies are Autocratic States such as Russia China Iran and North Korea. And Terrorist Groups, primarily ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.  

Their intentions are to establish multi-polar autocratic hegemony in their regions of influence. And Terrorists wish to establish Islamic Caliphates across the middle east.

Americas intention is to retain the Uni-polar world order that has existed since 1991. And remain the worlds sole superpower well into the next century. As for terrorists, Americas goal is to drive terrorism back to local levels to be dealt with by local security forces. Eventually, the need for US intervention will lessen as the groups become weak enough for the local authorities to deal with them. There will continue to be attacks, but they will be reserved to the local areas of the group, their body counts will be low, and they will be rolled-up by the local security forces.The War on Terror will transition to day-to-day law enforcement operations but before that can happen, the most violent, most well organized groups will have to be targeted, denied territory, and scattered.

2.I think you need to be more specific. Intervention differs from the word invasion. I support the Responsibility to Protect Doctrine. I think The United States has a duty to save people from starvation and ethnic cleansing. But since that's an ideological argument, ill put forth a realistic one based on current US interventions in the War on Terror.

Terrorists don’t go away because you ignore them. They aren’t bullies.But more importantly, they get more powerful when they have places to train and organize from. They get weaker when those “ungoverned spaces” are denied to them.

We do know what happens when the US did not treat terrorism as an act of war and resource that fight appropriately. You see, 9/11 was not the first attack by Al Qaeda on the United States. Most notably, two US embassies in Africa had been bombed in 1998 and then in 2000, the USS Cole was bombed in port in Yemen. In the first case, the US launched a few cruise missiles at AQ camps in Afghanistan (and a factory in the Sudan) but chose not to follow up. In the second case, it was treated straight forwardly as a criminal investigation. (There is some argument that AQ also attacked us in 1994 when the WTC was first bombed and in 1996 when the US military barracks in Dahran, Saudi Arabia was bombed but I don’t believe either of those were conclusively shown to be AQ.)

 
 So what was the result of not overreacting or spending excessively on the war on terror? AQ struck again. This time, they killed 3,000 people when they attacked the WTC on 9/11. As discussed above, we know there were plans to replicate that attack on the West Coast but with far more aircraft. AQ was demonstrating an *increasing* capability. At Tarnak Farms they were experimenting with Ricin and Sarin. (They were not getting very far but they were working on it…how much time should we have allowed them?)

Aside from 3,000 lives, 9/11 resulted in $40 BILLION in insurance losses . The stock market plummeted. The airline industry was crippled and required a bailout to the tune of $15 BILLION. The tourism industry suffered a 40% loss as well. 


 That was from one attack. Had the attacks continued as planned, the economic devastation would have been horrific.

Because they had a safe haven in Afghanistan, they were able to continue to train their recruits. They were able to develop their techniques and technologies because there was nobody there to stop them. They didn’t have to hide from drones and they weren’t being rolled up in the middle of the night.
 
 There is absolutely NO reason to suspect that 9/11 was going to be the last attack. And there is considerable evidence to believe that if AQ had been allowed to continue to operate freely in Afghanistan, they would have launched more and more impressive attacks.

Point two is, the expenditure and the War on Terror appears to have worked. After 9/11, AQ was disorganized. They lost their training camps. They lost their ability to gather in a single place and plan and plot and fund future attacks. They were never able to train their recruits to the same level as they had been trained prior to 9/11. Instead, they focused on huddling in small rooms and *talking* about how to fire a weapon or how to build a bomb without actually getting to test these skills out because that would mean attracting the attention of a drone or special operations raid.

 And how did that work out for them? Well, it turns out that when you can’t train. When you can’t smuggle in the best recruits to meet and develop plans, you end up with a lot of half-assed attacks that are more of an embarrassment than a true threat. The guys who attacked the London metro on 7/7 and the ones who perpetrated the Madrid train bombings had all be recruited and trained prior to 9/11.
 
 Since AQ could no longer bring their recruits to Afghanistan to train? Not one significant terrorist attack from AQ.

ISIL still has room to train. They have freedom of maneuver in parts of Iraq and Syria. But that room is shrinking. And while they have it they are still a significant threat as our friends in Paris and Brussels have unfortunately learned. So we have to continue to shrink that maneuver room so that ISIL can’t develop the same level of planning and training that AQ was able to benefit from in the 1990s.

So no, 30 Americans killed per year is not the justification for the War on Terror. The 2,970 Americans not killed per year is the justification. The $3.3 Trillion dollars which is not lost due to terrorist attacks is the justification.

There are costs. And then there investments.

3.The Practical International Situation is a world where terrorism is a thing of the past in size and scale. And an American dominated world where enemies are contained and most countries are transitioning to Liberal Democracies. Basically America from 2002-2008. Ideally every country would be a Liberal Democracy, but were a long time away from that world. The Major concerns is the Euro-American drift and isolationist and nativist tendencies across America and Europe. American abdication would have horrific effects on the world, just as weve seen in the 20s and 30s, the last time America refused its leadership role.

From the mindset of that culture, if 'you are raping your own spouse' you're a morally upstanding member of the community with a disobedient spouse.

I hate that outlook too, but pretending its something else entirely, and that semitic culture is anti-rape or pro-fidelity (on a basis of equality and consent anyways), is as dangerous as it is wrong.

Those same prohibitions against adultery were routinely cast aside through the dehumanization of oppressed peoples who were subjected to war, murder, rape, mutilation, occupation, and enslavement at the hands of semitic tribes.

The majority of Google's market is USA+EU. 

&gt;its crazy to me how much everyone gives these companies the benefit of the doubt.

It's crazy to me how people think these companies are plotting *something* with our data. They are not. Google's whole service ecosystem relies on data collection. Everything from search results, to your YouTube feed, to even map location searches relies on collecting your data and shredding it through machine learning algorithms to sort you out and provide you with relevant results to what you are actually looking for. 

Search results use your data to, for example, know if your ""kill child"" query is you being curious of murdered human children and having broken english, or you being curious about killing child processes. That query on ""virgin"" browser gives you 2-3 links related to child processes and the rest is just infanticide news, while my browser with my account logged in gives me a solid ~5 pages worth of child process related links before spouting the first infanticide-related link. This is prevalent in many of their services.

YouTube without data collection means you'd pretty much only get videos of people you subscribe to, while the rest of your feed is either popular videos or new videos. In fact, not even ""popular"" videos would work. Popular where? The USA popular videos are very different from my country's popular videos (Spain), for example. If you don't want data collection that also means no location data from you, so what, YouTube just serves up ""world popular"" videos?

GMail without data collection means useless spam filters.

Maps without data collection is similiar to search results without data collection. Typing ""Barcelona"" while being 5km away from Barcelona, Spain, would yield navigation results to a list of Barcelona cities, starting with Barcelona in Argentina, since you don't want google using your location data either.

GMail + maps + searches without data collection means no more convenient ""your flight AAA111 leaves in XX minutes and there is heavy traffic on your way to the airport, leave in YY minutes to arrive in time!"" notifications in your phone. 

Google makes so much money off advertising ***precisely** because it can target ads with extreme accuracy, ""wasting"" as little views as possible from advertisers.

Sometime, hopefully soon, the world (see below) will realize the hypocrisy and call for an end of genital cutting for both genders.

My personal answer (and yes personal , I don't have all the answers in the world, that doesn't mean my argument falls apart lol) is that circumcision is normalized in the US. And it's been normalized to the point there seems to be this idea that there needs to be an argument and proof against circumcision. That's why I posted the definition of FGM, to show this is completely backwards. But it is not normalized in all of the west and you can see many medical organizations that say it should not be done (see below). You even see proposals at laws to ban it, *you know the original article of the thread*. 

I believe in time everything you ask will be sorted out. Things change over time you know. There was probably a time when it wasn't called FGM, and a time when no one spoke out against it. There was even a time when western physicians supported FGM (really, look up Kellogg and how he recommended pouring acid on girl's clits). Things change, don't take the current status quo to mean that the status quo is justified.

And note that both the AAP and CDC have been criticized that [“Conceptually, the CDC relies on an inappropriate construal of risk in its benefit vs. risk analysis, since it appears to interpret “risk” as referring (primarily or exclusively) to the “risk of surgical complications.” and “...underestimated even the known risks of circumcision, by focusing on the comparatively rare, immediate surgical risks and complications that occur soon after the operation, while ignoring or downplaying the comparatively common intermediate and long-term complications”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364150/)

The Canadian Paediatric Society [“does not recommend the routine circumcision of every newborn male.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) I recommend reading this one since they have all the data clearly laid out, something you don’t often see.

The British Medical Association [“considers that the evidence concerning health benefits from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.”](http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/3/259.full)

The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (representing Australia and New Zealand) says [“the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand.”](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-of-infant-males.pdf)

The German Pediatrics Society position says [“in the interest of the best interests of the child, they should choose not to circumcise, even if it is for reasons of religion or tradition. Medical benefits of circumcisions are not sufficiently scientifically proven. ”](https://www.dakj.de/stellungnahmen/beschneidung-von-minderjaehrigen-jungen/)(translated by google)

The Joint statement from the Nordic Ombudsmen for Children and pediatric experts (representing Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland) says [“Circumcision, performed without a medical indication, on a person who is incapable of giving consent, violates fundamental medical-ethical principles, not least because the procedure is irreversible, painful and may cause serious complications. There are no health-related reasons for circumcising young boys in the Nordic countries. Circumstances that may make circumcision advantageous for adult men are of little relevance to young boys in the Nordic countries, and on these matters the boys will have the opportunity to decide for themselves when they reach the age and maturity required to give consent.”](https://www.crin.org/en/docs/English-statement-.pdf) 

The Royal Dutch Medical Association says [“There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in the light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds.”](https://www.knmg.nl/advies-richtlijnen/knmg-publicaties/publications-in-english.htm)

These were just some countries, we still have other developed countries against circumcision.

Well, looking at the list of scheduled friendlies for European and South American countries in the article, pretty much all of them are against World Cup teams.

&gt; The other FAs don’t give a shit about whether US is underachieving or any of the debates we’re having post-Trinidad...to them all we are is an available national team with a squad of competent pro players, many of whom with experience at decent levels in Europe.

Why wouldn't it matter, specially since the USMNT seems to be using something less than their best squad in friendlies these months (not that it's the wrong call, but still)? Having a good game against the USMNT right now tells top countries very little about their readiness for the World Cup, so it's not that useful.

hopeLB,str,*,"""Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and  Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council. While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council’s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest.

According to journalist Robert Parry “The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe “This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.”

Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.”

So, to make sense of all this, most of the people listed would have held cabinet positions in a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the Interpreter is a project of RFE/RL then the decision to go ahead with Propornot would have to go across their desk. That includes then Sec of State, John Kerry.

The unasked question of why would a US Government Agency do this (?) needs to be addressed. All the people listed above were actively working for Clinton to get her elected and throw Donald Trump’s campaign off the rails.

After the election, they were going to take care of Clinton’s “deplorables” by dissecting alternative media. I wrote about this before the election and I warned several major new sites what they could expect. I was right on the money. After she lost, it was already in motion. The deplorable media didn’t fall into a particular political pattern other than they did not promote Hillary Clinton.

The purpose of Propornot has been to get people to demand freedom of speech be rolled back. This was/is to be done by destroying fact-based media.

I mean seriously. How do you infiltrate 3,000 miles into the capital, but die when an android strangles you. Unbelievable.

The next one was quite interesting, another boy. Frank Catrin from America. He was a true leader, doe eyed and always smiling. I knew he had potential the first day he destroyed one of my nuclear silos. The footage was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. He knew the facility inside and out, he knew the guard rotations, he knew the security system, the boy was a phenomenal planner. But in his genius was arrogance. Monumental arrogance, perhaps almost as great as mine. If I could have spoken to him before the bullet blew away his head, I would tell him, “Frank, you’re a genius, but to be as arrogant as you are, you have to be my level of genius.”

My world has lost its beauty. No one dares to raise a hand. They do not look me in the eye. They stare at my feet like insects to a light. There is no thrill. No danger of death. No rebellions, no revolution, no LIFE. 

That is why, my dear Alexander, I am building *you.* You will be the ultimate enemy for me. You will be beautiful and strong, you will crush any of your foes that are not me. You will stand unchallenged until you reach me. You will be the second greatest man in the world.

In goes the brains. Kassidy. Bosnia boy. Frank. Then the past legends. Caesar. Napoleon. Hannibal. Rommel. Genghis. Saladin. 

My dear Alexander. You will live a life of poverty, but you will not die. You will claw your way out of the sewers, you will kick down everyone clinging onto you, and when you are finally ready. You will not show mercy, you will not try to sway me, you will completely and utterly destroy me.

Or not.


But you can try.

GunsTheGlorious,,,"Jesus, did you read anything I wrote?

Nobody wants a stagnant, stable planet, you fuckwit. 

We *do not have the capacity* to move 2 billion people. We *do not have the capacity* to continue feeding every human if desertification continues at this rate. You get this, right? We are looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe that will kill millions, or hundreds of millions. 

*Control-freak?* Are you *fucking* kidding me? *Inferior people from inferior countries?* This is a fucking global crisis. Your inability to fucking read notwithstanding, you seem to also have no idea what the *fuck* you're talking about, either.

&gt; Humans are part of the natural order

Yeah, that's the fucking problem, dickbrain. We're inside the natural order and we're fucking it up real good. We're gonna pull a Samson act and bring the fucking thing down on our heads.

Let me reiterate this; no environmental change on this scale has *ever* occurred in a couple of hundred years. Toba, which is the largest volcanic eruption we know of, which almost wiped out the human race, had less of an impact on the climate than the Industrial Revolution. 

Jesus Christ, it's fucking idiots like you that are why we're dealing with this issue right now. No one's asking your illiterate ass to give up modern conveniences. No one's asking you to go back to a farm and eke out a living in medieval conditions. The LHC and the ISS and the Apollo Program are a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of a percent of a very small part of the problem. But someone's convinced you that everyone who actually knows anything is just panicking and telling people this shit because they want to feel important, as opposed to the fact that *this is fucking important*.

&gt; I will either adapt and survive, as humans have always done no matter how harsh things got, or I will not

This is the point right here. *This is* the adaptation. We will either restrain our climate footprint or we will undergo the deaths, displacements, and impoverishments of billions. You think I'm talking about fucking North Africa or India? I'm talking about Western Europe. I'm talking about the East Coast of the US. Where I live? In the US of fucking A? It's gonna be underwater in 30 years at this rate. You remember the recession? We're gonna be remembering that as the good old days.

Y'know what, though, I know I didn't get through to you. You're so convinced that the reason that every single person who has studied this issue- including people who work for the fucking gas companies- are shitting themselves right now is because they're virtue signalling so they'll get laid. You're completely convinced that they want you to crush your car and only eat organic. If you're over 50 and male, statistically, you probably won't even live to see the worst happen. If not, then this is your problem too. 

I'm not gonna bother linking any actual studies here, cause this is reddit and you're not gonna read a 300 page study by some Harvard professor. I'm gonna link [this](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html) instead, and you're gonna ignore it even if you do read it. 

The only bright side here is that you are finally in the minority of people. Because, thank god, [last year the overwhelming majority of Americans understood the issue](http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx). So, who knows; maybe some shit will actually get done.

Brexit is undoubtedly negative, joining the EU was the only good economic decision made since WW2...but we aren't ""fucked"", over the span of a few decades Brexit is not likely to be particularly relevant. GDP might be lower but this could quite easily be offset by sensible policy making.

Second, leading on from that point, the problem is that British politicians are incapable of making sound economic decisions. Brexit reflects that: politicians are driven by, as you say, ""small-minded"" thinking from voters.

I think it is helpful, if you believe in independence, to separate those points. The latter argument is much more powerful because it actually explains why Brexit is bad. Just going, ""Oh, everything is fucked, let's roll the dice"" isn't an argument for anything. The economic effect of Brexit is unknown, the economic effect of the things that caused Brexit are very well known.

You call it ""small-minded"" thinking, whatever you call it, the result was economic stagnation until the UK joined the EU. For Scotland, the result of this complacency was the 1980s.

This is funny because [Hitler was actually on very good terms with the Mufti of Jerusalem and the whole Arab world](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-mufti-and-the-f-uuml-hrer), and later declared the Germans would help free them from British/French/Jewish imperialism.

Not wanting Muslims to over-run and genocide our own people doesn't mean we hate them, in fact [Nazi Germany had very positive supportive relations with the Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Arab_world).

&gt;""Erwin Rommel was almost as popular as Hitler. ""Heil Rommel"" was reportedly a common greeting in Arab countries. Some believed the Germans would free them from the rule of the old colonial powers France and Britain. After France's defeat by Nazi Germany in 1940, some Arabs were chanting against the French and British around the streets of Damascus: ""No more Monsieur, no more Mister, Allah's in Heaven and Hitler's on earth.""

No. I want self-determination and not to be genocided by mass refugee migrant waves.

I wasnt in low prio or comm banned. I didn't play any games and im already 6 month banned.

Guess it was retrospective or something like that.

Banned till August 1st.

I just recently started playing again after over 1 year and all my ges were 5 cores, russians screaming in mic and intentional feeding with courier and themselves. Last game i got ""reported"" by a Russian cm (one of the few games we had a ""support"" (didnt do any supporting) for buying ogre staff on legion commander because they thought i was building bkb when i was really building aghs.  I domt even know why the cm thought a bkb was a bad item on legion either. 

Can't say im going to be missing this much until august but kind of sad at the state of the game. Tbh my favorite times playing dota is when it was invite only. Everyone was so friendly and nice. 

Also, yes i was toxic at times, yes i also got fake reports for being a carry pick when we lose. Im not saying im completely innocent but that the system is poor. It offers no incentives to reform or be nice to others and promotes a culture of blaming and raging and toxic behavior. 

You cant even communicate with your team 75% of the time on eu servers. Anyone can pick a language on server select so i dont think the improved mm will do anything. 

I dont get why valve doesn't make a system like csgo overwatch for dota. Would solve so much and make the system not abuseable

redlightsaber,,Psychiatry,"&gt; How do we reconcile the liberal narrative that Trump's only base is uneducated trailer-dwellers, with the reality that many highly accomplished doctors remain on his side?

The obvious answer is that you don't need to make the case that Trump's only base are uneducated trailer-dwellers. This is actually quite a dangerous narrative, I think. Mainly because it doesn't reflect reality. And we need to understand reality in order to fix whatever is going on in the US. 

I tend to think a simpler answer is the same reason relatively wealthier people have always tended to be republicans, and  you just got a huge honking clue: the tax bill. The rest are secondary rationalisations. Wealthy people don't want to pay more taxes, so they support the party that will provide that for them. 

Physicians are no different from most people in terms of selfishness or missing the big picture of what the consequences of this are. I know we all like to think we're that much better, but we're really not. Even those among us strictly anchored on left political ideologies can have our days of spurious individualism. 

I don't know what the answer is for the US. It genuinely scares me, even though for now it seems the looming spread of racist nationalistic ideologies among widespread national politics has been halted in Europe. **For now**.

&gt; Rivo was born in The Hague, The Netherlands, May 1983. He grew up there and spent a lot of time busy on sports. As his musical interests were growing, he listened to house music during the mid 90s. After a while he decides to get seriously involved in making music and his success starts growing. His sound combines classic dub-techno elements with current trends. This way he gives a creative output which is much valued nowadays.

&gt; At an the initial stage he spread his music through the internet. Involved listeners, from e.g. Berlin, discovered Rivo’s work. He quickly received good responses and other people, particularly from east and south Europe, followed.

&gt; In the meanwhile he bought records and began to spin on some cheep gear. Right now, while dj-ing he always showcases a techno-oriented set organised with classics and fresh work. Each set is legendary Basic Channel inspired varying with current underground dub- and deep-techno records. This unique combination unite to a successful and creative own sound.

thatguyonthewebs_v2,,,"God, I love the cesspool that is twitter and our president's twitter. Fucking lol. Alright, he's trying to take credit.

Yes, it was. Does anyone ever ask, ""Why? Why did such a high corporate tax rate work then? Why did it steadily fall?"" Maybe because American companies had literally nowhere else to go. Europe? War torn, still rebuilding, half is off limits because of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. Okay, let's go to Asia... Japan is a glowing green island... China is recovering from devastation and massacres that make the holocaust look better. India? They just kicked out the British and have a very strong anti-west sentiment. Well, what about the other largely unaffected countries? Either lawless shitholes and/or trade taxes would make it too risky and/or non-profitable. Shit, looks like we're stuck until the world recovers and can compete again.

Yes it was! Bush lowered taxes to compete with free trade countries that NAFTA gave access to. The withdrawal of the auto industry started before Bush! So many industries moved to Mexico, it's insane! Why pay higher taxes and adhere to so many regulations and labor laws in America where Mexico doesn't have these extra regulations? Their gov't is too busy dealing with the cartel anyway! A few just skipped over the Detroit river to Canada. The Big 3 only had assembly plants here for over a decade now. All the parts were made abroad (because being in a lawless cartel-controlled shithole, car companies only produced parts so the cartel and other crime syndicates wouldn't have interest in stealing parts)

So no, cutting taxes give greedy businessmen more opportunity to make bigger money piles and put their businesses here. Competitive trade taxes means that companies will think twice about moving abroad to a cheaper, less regulated workforce when taxes would make the move higher risk with less reward. Look at all the sweat shops in all the Asian countries already. Apple, every clothing producer, etc. Pay these people poorly, little to no regulation on how it's produced and meet American standards of product quality.

I don't think third world and economically shitty first world countries should have free trade agreements with the USA. UK, France, Germany, Japan, other top countries? Yes. But shitty countries shouldn't be exploited by businesses and put American workers out of work.

Lastly, the bailouts were the one of the worst decisions any president had made.

If you remove blacks and hispanics from US statistics you need to compare it to countries with their own racial and ethnic groups that lag behind the curve.

That's how the parliament sees it.  I believe there's also a few council members who've been very insistent on these rights, and they would probably object to anything other than the deal they currently have.

Essentially, the EU parliament/council/commission have absolutely no interest in negotiating - they already have an 'acceptable' deal on the table for citizen's rights when the UK leaves the EU.

Rag_in_a_Bottle,,,"Okay what the fuck are you even saying anymore? You claimed that saying a racial slur would get you banned, yet you're still here racking in those upvotes. That was my ""point"". I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say in your first statement.

&gt; No, it's not fine if a culture or race becomes a minority in its homeland.

Are you enraged at the fact that mainland Europe is no longer Celtic? Do you think we should reinstate Celtic culture across Germany, France, and Iberia? Probably not, so I have to ask why? In this case, the Celts were removed largely by violence and war, not simply intermarrying and and breeding with Romans. Are you up in arms at the literal genocide of Native Americans? Should all non natives living in the Americas be removed? Again, probably not, so why? (On the off chance that you do agree with those statements please correct me).

&gt; What if millions of X rush in Israel and replace the native population?

...okay? So what? I don't care as long as they don't start killing people or putting them in camps.

&gt; What if Y rush into Native American lands and replace the native population?

That's what's called colonization. It's a thing that already happened and was a lot more violent and barbaric than anything going on in Europe right now. On that point, South/Central American communities were a lot more likely to intermarry and breed with the native populations. The end result was a new and unique culture. Shouldn't you like that?

&gt; It's not racist to not want that, it's racist to want that.

I don't know how many times I have to say it: no one is actively pushing for the elimination of European whites. Get that victim complex out of your head, because it's not true. I don't know if you simply don't understand that or are deliberately misleading yourself.

And no, it's not racist to want to preserve culture for culture's sake. On the subject of Celts, Irish people wanting to keep their language alive is not racist at all. What's racist is the belief that the natural and peaceful integration and evolution of culture is a bad thing that should be opposed.

And again, your last paragraph is gibberish. What's your obsession with the word ""nigger"" and trigger warnings? I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

As a final point, you don't seem to understand what culture is. It's not a static feature of a society. It changes all the time according to technology, the environment, and other groups of people.

---

**Things they got right and how:**

- Larger highway signs - By making them larger and easier to read while driving
- Computerized safe driving predictors - By emergency auto-breaking cars
- Computerized traffic updates - By GPS
- Computerized speed suggestions - Electronic city speed signs that change during rush hour/ hightraffic, and GPS
- Rearview television screens - Exactly that 
- Prefabricated bridges - Many smaller bridges can be(and are) built with prefab parts
- Self building bridges - Apparently China has these. Fuck me i was gonna label it as wrong.
- cantilevered skyways - Extremely rare, but exist
- decentralized cities with longer commutes - Absolutely 100% correct
- Highspeed highways all over the continent - Since the time this video was made, highways have exploded all over the world connecting everyone.
- Self driving cars - Exactly that
- Synchronized scanning map - GPS. Using satellites to scan instead of the car. 
- Video Conferences - Skype, Facetime, countless examples.
- Car elevators - Not like they showed, but are absolutely real and used by wealthy condo owners. 
- parking cylinders - Not horizontally like the video, but rather vertically above and underground.
- Moving sidewalks - Mostly used in airports
- Escalators - Magically moving staircases!
- Water capable cars - They exist, but are expensive to maintain, impractical, and slightly dangerous. 
- Highways will link together nations - Europe

---

**Things they almost got right and why/why not:**

- Radar for poor visibility - Self driving cars have a form of radar, but no visual radar screen exists in commercial vehicles
- Air born emergency services - Helicopters are used by paramedics to quickly bring people to hospital, by police to follow pursuit in chases, and by firefighters to drop water on forest fires, but they aren't combined into 1 service vehicle and aren't used to tow cars
- Giant road builders - We have machines that can lay brick roads, and machines that can pave roads, but most require the help of other machines and people, and cannot build brand new roads over unworked land by themselves.
- Preset destination cards for pleasure vehicles - Cruise ships and party buses come close to this, but neither are used to get from point A to point B, 
- Gas turbine cars - they have been built, but incredibly impractical and dangerous
- Jet Cars - these have also been built, and have the same problem
- Electric suspension car - Electric sun powered cars exist, but the hover suspension does not.
- Tubular highways - Elon musk is currently designing something very similar to this idea, but with trains
- Suspended bridges over oceans - Canada's Confederation Bridge goes over the Northumberland straight for a whopping 12.9-kilometer distance. Not an ocean, but incredibly long. 

---

**Things they got wrong and why:**

- Colour coded highways - The cost in paint and upkeep would be enormous
- Iradiated roads - Because cancer
- fog dispelling machines - cost? How exactly would that even work
- Atomic reactor tunneling machine - Incredibly dangerous idea
- Cars that separate - Because you don't want to seperate your family into oncoming traffic. Dangerous, impractical, and ridiculous. 
- Advances in technology will give more time for leisure - Because the rich have horded all the wealth while prices continually increase. Why continue to pay people decent wages when robots can do everything, and the unemployed will happily work more for less? Creating competition in the job market which only benefits the employers who then use tax havens to ensure that they pay the very least they can back into the system. 
- Highway escalators - impractical and costly when the alternative is to simply build around or through the mountain for cheaper, faster, and less maintenance.
-  Trains that separate on the go - Long theorized but not yet realized
- Trains cars that go directly to market - would have to lay tracks everywhere and the amount of coordination/traffic control would be ridiculously impossible to properly manage. Transport trucks do this job instead
- Trains that drive onto boats and stack up - Possible, but impractical. I'm sure it's probably been done somewhere with poor results.
- Trains that drive onto boat
- Trains that drive into rockets that fly - Bitch are you high? That is the most dangerous thing so far suggested. 
- Nuclear cars - The Next level of dangerous suggestions. Who doesn't enjoy fallout with their car crashes?
- Air-conditioned indoor highways - Why heat or cool the whole highway when you can simply control your car temp.
- Private garages that clean and fuel your vehicle - while entirely possible, these ideas are impractical and dangerous.

Jagoff86,,,"Oh really, so they have a choice in Saudi Arabia? A lot of Muslim countries are bastions of progressive ideas huh? Islam is very clear on this stuff, so if you studied it more you'd know. Go listen to some of Ayan Hirsi Ali's speeches. 

 Some of the more moderate Muslim countries may give women an option, but most do not. Most need a male companion to leave the house, their testimony under Sharia is worth half of a man's, genital mutilation, etc. I wonder why hundreds of European women have been sexually assaulted, told to cover up, harassed, and/or raped by Muslim refugees simply for dressing in normal western clothing???

If you want some examples just look at articles and YouTube videos of Muslim attacks on women in Europe such as Cologne Germany for example. Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe btw.

hachihoshino,,Working in Japan,"&gt; I still feel like this sub shouldn't have to scare away and be assholes to anybody that comes by here

But this is the thing, you keep saying that... and yet I'm not seeing examples of it. Look down the front page of the sub - it's basically full of people asking questions and getting answers. The only thread where I'd say someone is getting a bit of a harsh time from posters is the guy who wants to move to Japan to... er... *stalk people and report them to immigration*, and if that doesn't deserve a harsh time I don't know what the hell does.

In terms of ""growing the sub"" - I really don't think that having a ton more questions posted here is going to attract more people to answer them. The simple fact is that Reddit isn't hugely popular in Japan (either Japanese or immigrants) and therefore most people who could answer questions on these topics don't use this site. Also, growing the sub isn't really our goal - the reality is that there aren't all that many people out there who have legit questions about moving to Japan that can't be answered more quickly and easily on Google. There's a simple reason for that; moving to Japan is *really easy*. It's a wealthy developed country with an *incredibly* straightforward and welcoming immigration policy - coming here is much, much easier than immigrating to Europe or the United States, or to pretty much any other developed country. There aren't really any gotchas or tricky aspects to the standard immigration procedure, and as such you'd expect the number of questions to be asked in a sub like this to be pretty low - because for most people, they just follow the standard advice (on official immigration websites etc.) and have no problems. 

There's zero value in a subreddit that's just full of people asking questions that are fully answered in the first hit on Google, and I don't entirely understand why a handful of people are so adamant that we're being mean and horrible by discouraging that behaviour. ""What research have you done by yourself to solve this problem?"" is the first question I ask students any time they come to me with an issue in their studies or research, and they're paying thousands of dollars a year to be at university - is it so unreasonable to ask the same of people trying to get advice from redditors for free?",True,0,1517535199,,False,0,dtlqrpl,True,t3_7scjew,t1_dtlpia3,/r/movingtojapan/comments/7scjew/psa_meta_posts_about_this_sub_complaints_or/dtlqrpl/,1518844091,1,False,movingtojapan,t5_3fy6c,public,

bananarepubliccat,,,"A few things...the next recession will occur with or without Brexit, it would have occurred if we had stayed in the EU. Recessions don't have catalysts either. It appears that way in retrospect but the catalyst for all recessions, broadly speaking, is an upturn as capitalism is inherently cyclical. Automation is neither here nor there (the relative change in productivity that automation will bring is nothing compared to the ones we have already experienced). 

You are totally correct, globalisation of supply chains is very important . But it is also true that those trends are happening everywhere. Being in the EU makes that easier but China isn't in the EU and a lot of ""intermediate production"" happens there...as an example. Also, the reason why the trend is so important is that it forced inefficient producers out of business. Improving competitiveness was always something that Britain could have done outside the EU, it is something that other countries have done no problem (but my point was that this never would have happened because our politicians are spineless).

The Scottish govt is not prepared, not even close. They are amazingly short of policy making expertise, the SNP is somewhat dominant but can't communicate effectively outside their base, most of our politicians are just nowhere the calibre needed for independence as their world is just their constituency and blaming the Tories. Ez life. The real world is totally different as there is no-one to blame and you are faced with decisions that will often hurt some people badly.

&gt; Sabaton is a symphonic power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts. In April 2012, four members left the band and formed another, whilst vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members.

&gt; Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.

&gt; In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.

&gt; The band returned for a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.

&gt; Their third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like ""Back in Control"" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), ""Attero Dominatus"" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and ""Angels Calling"" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.

&gt; In March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song ""Birds of War"".

&gt; As a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles ""Cliffs of Gallipoli"" and ""Ghost Division"".

&gt; In September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.

&gt; The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War ""White Death"". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.

&gt; On March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found, Sabaton used digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.

&gt; Following the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage, ""Carolus Rex,"" the first single for the album of the same name (Carolus Rex), was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world tour headlined as ""The Swedish Empire Tour"". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.

&gt; ""Carolus Rex"" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album was made available in both Swedish and English versions.

&gt; Regarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented: ""It appears to be sudden, but it had actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...""

&gt; The former members of Sabaton have since formed a new band called ""Civil War"", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.

&gt; In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. With Snowy Shaw replacing him as touring drummer.

&gt; In November 2013, it was announced that Sabaton would be touring North America with Iced Earth for six weeks in the spring of 2014. Robban Bäck has also left the band and been replaced with Hannes van Dahl of Evergrey.

&gt; In January 2014, the band announced the cover of their new album called ""Heroes,"" due to be released on May 16 2014. The album proved to be a hit and made #1 on the official Swedish album chart. On 27 January the band was announced to play Download Festival in June.

&gt; Thobbe Englund left Sabaton as guitarist with release of their new album ""The Last Stand"" on 19th August 2016 to ""expand his own creativeness in combination with a somewhat stiller life, where he will not tour all year round at the speed of light"" as he said himself.

GunsTheGlorious,,,"The problem with that is that it ignores the way the fundamental logic behind the concept of money.

You are attaching a significance to a piece of paper (or, more likely these days, a number on a screen). This piece of paper has no intrinsic value to you or, say, the barista at your favorite coffee shop. 

So *why* are you attaching that significance? Because everyone else does, right? Money only has significance as long as both sides of the transaction give it significance; try spending Indians rupees in a French cafe, and you're gonna get thrown out and told to come back with some euros. 

The *reason* you attach this significance- the reason everyone in your country attaches this significance- is because the government of your country said it was so. This is why, for example, in 1995, when the countries of the EU decided to accept the euro, people accepted the new currency; because the government said ""now this paper is valuable, and the old one isn't"", and people believed them. 

The only reason they have to believe them is faith that now, to everyone in their country (and several others), this type of paper was valuable.

&gt; Millionaire is a Belgian rock band formed in 1999 by former Evil Superstars, dEUS and Eagles of Death Metal guitarist, Tim Vanhamel.

&gt; They have released three albums:
Outside The Simian Flock (2001)
Paradisiac (2005)
Sciencing (2017)

&gt; Paradisiac was produced by Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age) and fine-tuned at fellow QOTSA member Alain Johannes' studio. The album saw the band creating a harder-edged sound with obvious influences from the Queens.

&gt; Josh noticed Millionaire opening for the Masters of Reality in the SMAK (Ghent) and was so impressed he asked them to support his band on their European and American tours. Millionaire have since toured with Muse and Foo Fighters and in the U.S. with the Taste Of Chaos 2006 festival.

&gt; The band released two tracks for the Ex-Drummer soundtrack, Mongoloid (Devo cover) and Deep Fish. In this movie, they are played by the fictional band ""The Feminists"". Tim has recently released his own solo album. On December 5th, 2008, the band announced they are working on a new album. Read more on Last.fm.

windsyofwesleychapel,,,"Each state had its own method for determining whether or not the Constitution would be ratified.  Not all states had public process, but all states did have a process where the citizenry (as defined in each state) voted for members of the state legislatures which did make the decision.  It was rather indirect in some cases, but the issues were strongly debated in the public sphere and politicians were pressured to side with the prevailing feelings of the population. 

The territories not in the original 13 colonies ceded to the US in 1783 had no choice but were sparsely populated with those of European decent.  True, native americans were not given a choice, but they were never given a choice anywhere ever, by anyone including France, Britain, Spain etc.  Each new territory would be organized and when the population was sufficiently large (60K) they would form a state legislature, write a constitution, and then ask for full admittance into the Union.  No, they weren't given the option of forming their own countries, but as these territories were filled with American settlers, that was never part of the plan.  Puerto Rico, won from Spain in 1898 has decided NOT to become a state though all Puerto Ricans are US citizens from birth.  It has had the option to become its own country if if the population wishes, but as of yet they have chosen to remain a territory of the US (as all modern states of the US minus the original 13 were prior to gaining statehood).

They're a European raccoon-dog (as in the European cousins of tanuki and not a hybrid between raccoons and dogs). With a mostly ashy to brown coat with vermilion and or autumn red accents mostly on the underbelly in the shape of a cross (though there could be other markings as well, like having the fur at the bottom of the legs and by the paws being one of the accent colors or something). This underbelly is also scarred by a brand of a small to perhaps medium sized Phoenix rising from ashes (obviously not in any particular degree of detail given the fact that its a brand as opposed to a tattoo). They also have small and old miscellaneous scars from small incidents throughout their time. 

Though they are stubborn to the core and not particularly revealing, time spent with them would tell you that they are a good person and a loyal friend willing to do more for others than even himself. Frankly, many of the scars would likely tell tales of them helping friends though out time long past. Meeting them today would tell you that they are a loner mentally battered and beaten by an inability to form a relationship that felt mutualistic instead of being him giving all of himself to someone not willing to do the same.

As I said before, it's not fully flushed out but it's a thought I've had for quite awhile and I would love to see an interpretation as done by an artist certainly better than myself.

RichSaila,,,"Here's what Tolkien had to say about that:  
&gt;May I say that all this is 'mythical', and not any kind of new religion or vision. As far as I know it is merely an imaginative invention, to express, in the only way I can, some of my (dim) apprehensions of the world. All I can say is that, if it were 'history', it would be difficult to fit the lands and events (or 'cultures') into such evidence as we possess, archaeological or geological, concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now called Europe; though the Shire, for instance, is expressly stated to have been in this region. I could have fitted things in with greater versimilitude, if the story had not become too far developed, before the question ever occurred to me. I doubt if there would have been much gain; and I hope the, evidently long but undefined, gap* in time between the Fall of Barad-dûr and our Days is sufficient for 'literary credibility', even for readers acquainted with what is known or surmised of 'pre-history'.  
I have, I suppose, constructed an imaginary time, but kept my feet on my own mother-earth for place.

And a footnote elaborates on the gap:  
&gt;\* I imagine the gap to be about 6000 years : that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages were of about the same length as S.A. and T.A. But they have, I think, quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh.

So the events of the legendarium do not fit neatly into our known history - which is obvious, I suppose - but if we were to try and place them, then only events that happened before approximately 4000 B.C. would have been concurrent with the *Lord of the Rings* and earlier history of the legendarium.

One thing to understand is that territory won from Mexico is not considered part of the South in this timeline, due to it being large enough to be it's own region. The ""core"" Southern states are known as the ""Deep South"" and have no Northern military presence (more than normal). This ""Deep South"" (consisting of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina) plus Florida and Louisiana are the more industrialized part of the South. Southern states west of the Mississippi wanted Union troops to protect them from Indian and Mexican raids, they would be open to a permanent garrison. 

A hostile Britain is certainly at the start a detriment to the US economy, but the US can search for other trade partners. And with the British being forced to allow US ships to pass (this was part of the war of 1812) they can trade with Europe as they please. American and British relations were already poor, especially during the 1860s, but profit is one of the best motivators there is, so I think a trade between both nations will still happen similar to OTL.

It’s been invaded by indo aryans,greeks, persians, arabs, mongols, various turkic peoples, and europeans. I don’t understand why you guys seem to think India was this homogenous hindu state where everyone rode elephants and spoke hindi until the british came. Chandragupta spoke a different language (hell modern india has like 40 unique recognized languages all of which are very different, not to mention the fact that Gandhi mainly spoke English), he had a different religion than almost all modern indians, he was quite possibily a now extinct ethnicity and the demographics of his land were much different. The Mauryan empire encompassed more than just modern India and if you take a look at those countries, they all have their unique cultures, art and architecture. So its absolutely ludicrous to claim that there is continuity. Chandragupta lived around the same tim if not a bit later than Alexander, tell do ancient Greeks and the Byzantines have continuity? If thats not the case then why the fuck do you think Chandragupta has continuity with Gandhi? Theres like nearly 2400 years between them! Saladin and Celopatra and their people have far more in common than Chandragupta and Gandhi, I’m sorry but the fact that you think there is continuity just proves you still have a really dumb stereotypical view of the Indian subcontinent and don’t really understand the shear diversity there and seem to think they’ve been a homogenous people for 4000 years or something.

We went with AncestryDNA because they break Asia into three separate DNA regions: South Asia, East Asia and Central Asia. I believe 23 and me only has South and East Asian DNA categories, so if more regional granularity is important to you i think AncestryDNA has a slight edge.

Unfortunately neither test will give you a break down of WHERE in South Asia your ancestors are from, which is unfortunate as the populations in many regions are quite homogeneous. I think it's because of smaller sample size for non - Caucasian / European people.

The Palatine Chapel (Italian: Cappella Palatina), is the royal chapel of the Norman kings of Sicily situated on the first floor at the center of the Palazzo Reale in Palermo, southern Italy.

Also referred to as a Palace church or Palace chapel, it was commissioned by Roger II of Sicily in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the mosaics being only partially finished by 1143. The sanctuary, dedicated to Saint Peter, is reminiscent of a domed basilica. It has three apses, as is usual in Byzantine architecture, with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical columns.

The chapel is notable for its fusion of influences, reflecting the melting pot of Sicily at the start of the XII century. The floor plan is a Latin cross basilica, decorated by Byzantine mosaics commissioned from Constantinople, with interventions from Arab craftsmen, as seen in the ceiling decorated by [typical muqarnas](https://i.imgur.com/GuQkZly.jpg).

The ceiling is particularly interesting because it is decorated, contrary to the Muslim prohibition on figurative decoration, with [profane scene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Arabischer_Maler_der_Palastkapelle_in_Palermo_002.jpg) depicting King Roger and its court.",True,1,1517558808,,False,0,dtm7rex,True,t3_7uptjy,t3_7uptjy,/r/europe/comments/7uptjy/the_arabnormanbyzantine_palatine_chapel_cappella/dtm7rex/,1518852211,20,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

Sir_Toasty,,,"It depends on what you plan to use the car for, and how long you plan to keep it. 

For example if you live in the city/suburbs and don't often take long trips then a 4-door hatch may be good fit for you, conversely if you live in the rural area with unsealed roads a 4WD could be a better bet. 

As for SUV's once gain it can depend, SUV's can be relatively crappier than the Sedan/wagon/hatch platforms they are based on, they eat more fuel(usually because of their weight), they often perform poorer in emergency avoidance and braking situations(also weight related), and AWD/4WD systems can create expensive repair costs in the long run if you don't look after them, as well as usually being more expensive than the equivalent non-SUV hatch/wagon. 

For family cars if space isn't a issue(despite what the snobs tell you otherwise) Commodores/Falcons are fine family cars that have cheap parts available, and are easy and cheap to get serviced anywhere, Camry's are also fine but a bit smaller and most of the Japanese and Korean makes aren't bad for Cost and reliability, Euro's in general can be more expensive to get parts for and that is a factor you should consider for over the longer term, and if you want more than 5 Seats(if you want to bring the kids friends with you) people movers can be a good option, the modern 8 seat Kia Carnival gets good reviews and is more 'car like' than most similar size SUVS and a little bit cheaper(A relative bought one against the Kluger and a few others based on those factors when they needed more than 5 seats, and they had fit 3 baby seats in the Commodore Sportswagon they owned before that). 

Also don't forget to check things like minimum octane ratings for fuel, whereas Commodores and Falcons will be fine on regular RON-91 Fuel, more modern Euro and Japanese Cars can require RON 95 Fuel as a minimum(generally due to RON-95 being the 'regular' fuel in Europe) and more performance models across all manufacturers can require RON-98 fuel, also be careful with diesel cars, as modern ones often have Diesel Particulate Filters which can require extra things for you to do to maintain them and avoid an expensive replacement(or in the case of recent reports, fires in a particular model after they have driven through grass fields). 

Don't forget to factor in Servicing schedules, some require 6 months, some allow up to 12 months, some may only get 10,000kms between services, some may get 15,000kms(that being on the 'whatever comes first' basis) so once again, a low km 12 monthly schedule may be fine for in the city, but a higher km schedule may require less services in the country. 

In the end, you have to decide what you want out of the car, and buy appropriately, if a SUV fits the bill of your requirements then don't feel bad about owning one.",True,0,1517566244,,False,0,dtmau1e,False,t3_7upkc2,t3_7upkc2,/r/australia/comments/7upkc2/if_no_to_a_suv_what_car_for_a_family/dtmau1e/,1518853681,5,False,australia,t5_2qh8e,public,

TheEyeDontLie,,,"Ernest awoke with a yelp of panic, followed by a groan of nausea. His head was hanging off the edge of the bed. He felt suffocated. During his restless sleep, his sheet had tangled with his clothes. He rolled around, untwisting his limbs and pulling his head back on top of the lumpy mattress. He didn't have a pillow. Wriggling, with some effort, Ernest placed his skull against the concrete wall. It felt hard and firm. It too moved, but more like a gently breeze. Swallowing hard and dry, he faught to control his balance. The room swayed and rocked, as his mind stumbled into the day, like a pirate fresh at a sketchy port.  &amp;nbsp; 
""Water... Please..."" Ernest croaked, but nobody was there to hear him. He was, like always, alone. There was no water either. Creaking his eyes open a crack, one at a time, he looked around. It was a plain room. A room couldn't be much more basic without being a prison cell. ""At least a prison a prison cell would have water"", mumbled Ernest as he grasped for an open bottle. The beer spilt. Blood temperature and sticky, the stale beer rolled over his chest, and pooled underneath his armpit. He rolled over some more. Sip. He winced. Sip. He eyes began to open again. Sip, gulp. Ernest sat up and coughed, a short and violent fit. He half fell out of bed as the heat, humidity, and hangover waged war on him. He kicked the sheets off the bed, along with his flip-flops, and lay back down. Keeping his bare feet on the ground helped slow the earthquakes. Eyes shut once more, Ernest finished the rest of the warm,but wet, beer. One hand fumbled for the cigarettes in his pocket. The other hand waved weakly in the air, only a white rag short of declaring surrender, as he hunted for the switch for the fan. After a minute or so, he had both tasks completed, and puffed a cheap cigarette as the cracked and squeaky desk fan blew the harsh smoke away. It was too hot. His head hurt.  &amp;nbsp;  
 
A few minutes later, Ernest was on his feet. He observed for damage from the previous evening, as he couldn't remember coming home. He couldn't remember much after the first few tequilas actually, now that he thought about it. Or rather, didn't think about. The room looked the same as always. There were the bare whitewashed walls, insect stained and cracking. Empty bottles, trash, and his few meager belongings still littered the filthy floor. Everything, of course, was covered with a fine layer of sand and dog hair. The duct tape holding the mosquito netting over the window had come loose again. He'd have to fix that, although with the two inch gap under the door, he doubted it'd make much of a difference. Besides, he'd become used to constantly itching. He could buy malaria pills at the pharmacy in town, and the dengue mosquitoes flew during the daytime anyway. Ignoring his flip-flops, Ernest grabbed a few coins from the old wooden table and pushed his way into the blinding sunlight.  &amp;nbsp; 
 
The corner store was only a few minutes from home, and the walk did freshen him up a little. It was noisy here, but a peaceful kind of noise. Waves crashing formed the backdrop, while over that, softened by the thick, tropical air, dogs barked, scooters growled, and birds, insects, and babies all did their thing. Ernest walked through a blur. The store had everything you needed. Everything, at least, if you didn't want to jump in a beat up old taxi van to town. For Ernest, it was more than enough. He got a gallon of water, fresh coconut juice in a plastic bag, two eggs, a few bread rolls, a chilli, a red pepper, a bunch of spinach, a giant bottle of beer, and a small bottle of café-mezcal. The owner and his brother brewed the mezcal themselves. The finest local moonshine, made from the regions particular, unique agave plant, blended with sugar and coffee from another town nearby. It was cheap, strong, and highly caffeinated- suitable for breakfast, lunch, or an evening digestif. Given his head today, Ernest swore never to touch the ""special green"" blend again. Weed and liquor obviously didn't mix well with him. The tramadol and cocaine probably hadn't helped either. Last night had been too crazy. He hoped he wouldn't repeat it again tonight. 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Feeling much better now after the walk and downing the coconut juice, Ernest walked slower, enjoying the sights. You could tell the tourists here by how fast they walked. How fast they did everything. In the store, a European couple had gotten impatient at the slowness. The owner had just given them a big smile, then turned back to Ernest, who was practicing his Spanish. They always entertained each other, and he was a good, repeat customer.

ShadowofDarkness666,,,"Great post. I'd like to point out though, at the risk of sounding pedantic, that China is not a *global superpower*. The word superpower is thrown around casually a lot nowadays. And I'd let it slide in most cases, but you explicitly prefixed 'global' before the word, and it irked me.

The word 'superpower' implies overwhelming dominance within the global economy, significant political influence within the international community and in multilateral institutions, underwriting security architectures in various different regions of the world. But a superpower also needs to have the capability to project considerable power beyond its own region, and across the globe. People may like to believe that military power is less relevant today than in previous centuries, and that may be so. But no more in this century than in previous centuries can a state become a viable hegemon without the capability to intervene militarily to effect the outcome of conflicts or to prevent conflicts. A superpower needs to have alliances throughout the world, that would not only allow it a logistical capability to project its military power, but also to call upon those allies to form a coalition when undertaking any substantial effort whether through coercive diplomacy, economic sanctions, or military action. 

China today has a sum total of 1 ally, North Korea, which is often more of a liability than an asset. Even the most ardent advocates of Chinese power are under no illusions as to how many allies China could count on in an actual war, especially a war of choice. The number of countries China could rally to put into place an effective sanctions regime is also something more likely to be counted in single digits, for the foreseeable future(unless the United States goes full protectionist alienating the rest of the world, creating a vacuum for China to fill in). When considering the ability to project power, it is true that China has considerable and ever-growing economic influence over several countries in different regions of the world, but those countries are unlikely to concede strategic interests to economic coercion unless China can stitch up a broad-based coalition of countries to back its cause. When it comes to military power, the situation becomes more bleak. The hard truth is that China would struggle to deploy and sustain even 200,000 troops thousands of miles away and would likely struggle in any offensive war outside its region. Without the capability to actually wield military power in every part of the world, and the security alliances to go with it, China will never be able to influence the actual balance of power and underwrite stability for regions outside its own. Economic prowess may give China some influence or leverage over countries, but without military and diplomatic power, China will not gain a place within the security architecture of the Middle East, or that of South America or Europe. One also has to consider whether China would ever accumulate the political and diplomatic capital necessary to secure international legitimacy through the UN for its military interventions. China's revisionist and aggressive posturing on territorial disputes has already stirred a regional backlash against it. Other countries are more wary of Chinese power than eager to cooperate and work with it. People who decry American foreign policy as imperialism forget that the 'American Empire' is largely one by invitation. Other nations seek American power to balance their threatening neighbours and provide stability to the region. There are various factors why American power is alluring and tolerable, even if frustrating in some instances, for most states as opposed to hegemons of the past. I'd prefer not to get too much into that.(Geography, politics, enlightened self-interest instead of narrow interests). But suffice to say that unless Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and other democracies in the region are ready to kowtow to Chinese hegemony, China will never be able to exercise the kind of influence that the United States enjoys, even in its own backyard. China seeks a sphere of influence in the region which would clash with other countries' interests, and thus be an existential threat to some and a great cause for concern to others. The strength of a superpower should be judged by whether it has varied leverages at its disposal to react to developments in international affairs. For example, the United States enjoys considerable military, economic, political and diplomatic leverage in every region of the world, in some cases unparalleled and undisputed. It can utilize these robustly and efficiently to achieve the desirable outcome, or more likely prevent the worst possible outcome, in a particular crisis. However China currently only has economic leverage over some countries, with little ability to wield sanctions as efficiently as the United States and the European Union. China doesn't even have undisputed military superiority in its own region. If economic coercion fails, China has no other leverage to utilize in South America, Middle East, Europe and even parts of Asia. Hardly a superpower by any semblance of the definition of the word, especially a 'global' one. 

And yet China is more than a great power. One could say it is a great power on the verge of being a regional superpower. A 'global' superpower status, or as I would call an actual superpower, is at least two decades away. Even the Soviet Union could not match the power projection capabilities or the political influence of the United States. It remains to be seen how China does in the future. China is the aspiring superpower. As for India, it still hasn't cemented its position as a great power, let alone aspire to be a superpower. Not too long ago, most people would have classified it as a middle power. India is not an 'up and coming super power'. It's a new great power which has a long way to go.

As for the West doing nothing 'because it can't do anything', I think this is almost similar to what Obama did in Syria, provide the American people a false choice between inaction and total war. I am not in favour of any military action either, but to say we can't do **anything** is escapism at its worst.


[How the U.S. Can Help Resolve the Rohingya Crisis](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/burma-myanmar/2018-01-04/how-us-can-help-resolve-rohingya-crisis)
&gt;The United States is the most important player here. During the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, Washington led the international community in welcoming Myanmar out of a self-imposed exile that had lasted since a military coup in 1962. In 2012, after Myanmar’s first free election in over 20 years, Obama restored diplomatic relations and sealed the new relationship with a personal visit; in 2016, he dropped most remaining U.S. sanctions. Perhaps the United States moved too quickly—but it should consider making clear to Myanmar’s leadership that this move is not irreversible. **The leverage that helped push the Myanmar military to accept limited democratization—the United States’ pivotal role in either facilitating or complicating Myanmar’s entry into the global economic order—is still available for use. The sanctions on trade and investment, which Obama eliminated by executive order, could be reimposed: some by presidential action alone, others with the cooperation of Congress; sanctions on individuals within the Myanmar military and civilian leadership could be greatly expanded; while the United States is not itself a supplier of military hardware to Myanmar, it could press its security partners (including Israel, India, France, and Germany, all of which have sold arms to Myanmar in the past decade) to shut down cooperation**.  Some analysts argue that China remains Myanmar’s largest investor and security partner and that Beijing would gladly serve as Myanmar’s international sponsor without any consideration of human rights. This is true—but it was also true before the Saffron Revolution of 2007, which set the wheels of democratization in motion. Myanmar’s leaders, and more important the country’s population, have already proven that they do not want to remain pawns of China.

There are various ways to exert influence short of a military intervention. However, given this administration's total lack of leadership in confronting human rights violations or authoritarian governments, other than Iran and North Korea, and it's crusade to wreck the State Department, undermine American alliances in Europe and Asia, and it's narrower interpretation of American 'national interests', it is doubtful whether any concerted effort will be undertaken by the United States. And has so often has been pointed out in the past, including your own post, when the United States does not provide leadership, the rest of the world is unlikely to undertake large efforts precisely because they lack the political, diplomatic, and military power necessary to rally a large coalition of varied nations together. And so the international community is largely going to sit this one out.

KierosDOW,s1 46 team-46 country-eng,Sunderland,"No we aren't. We blame the board for their poor financial decisions and the managerial merry-go-round system that they have employed at the club. There's a clear cycle. 

Manager buys player, high fee high wages 

Manager gets sacked. 

New manager comes in, doesn't like the players the old manager bought so either sells them for a loss, or just leaves them on the bench during games.

New manager then buys his own players. High fee high wages.

Rinse and repeat.

This leads to debt and thus less funds to improve the team. Add that to the owner wanting to sell the club and not wanting to invest more that he already has.

We haven't even been in this situation for 10 years. 2010/2011 was our best year by far, but poor decisions meant that we only finished 10th, when we were challenging for European places around Christmas (6th). We only picked up 10 points from February to the end of the season, with the sale of Bent and Injuries to players being the main reason.

Our situation now is dire because we have no money, and we have needed to sell or loan out our best players to get the wages off our books. If you want bad board decisions look no further that Jack Rodwell, who remains to be on £70,000 a week after saying he wanted to leave for footballing reasons, despite turning down a loan move on deadline day. Over the years we have signed too many players who are happy to sit around every week and show no effort on the pitch. Grayson didn't work out for us, and he made a real shitshow of our goalkeeping situation. Coleman looks like the right man for the job, but he is largely restricted on having to sign young players on loan. For once we have a manger who only wants to bring players who are up for the challenge we face for the rest of the season.

Injuries have also played a big part in our misfortune, but Moyes wasn't one of the main reason we went down last year. He didn't play some of our best players, made poor transfer decisions, and spent the whole season talking about how we were going to be in a relegation fight, whilst having the enthusiasm of a crippled pony. Look at the difference between the players under Allardyce and then Moyes. There's a complete lack of effort under Moyes, who failed to motivate the team for all 38 games of the season. 

West ham aren't a wrong choice club. Moyes is a wrong choice manager. We were the wrong choice for him because he wasn't up for the fight. He did wonders at Everton, but that was a long time ago. His managerial record speaks for itself. West Ham have more that enough quality in their team to stay up this year.

&gt;**Fogo começou por volta das 2h e não havia funcionários no galpão da Estrada do Tindiba.**  


&gt; Um grande incêndio atingiu o centro de distribuição dos Correios na Estrada do Tindiba, em Jacarepaguá, na Zona Oeste do Rio, na madrugada desta sexta-feira (2). O fogo começou por volta das 2h, e, por isso, não havia funcionário no local. Segundo os bombeiros, ninguém ficou ferido. As chamas atingiram boa parte da estrutura, que acabou desabando. Durante a madrugada, os moradores foram acordados com o barulho das explosões. Bombeiros de três quarteis deram apoio ao Corpo de Bombeiros de Jacarepaguá. No início desta manhã as chamas já tinham sido controladas e os bombeiros trabalhavam no rescaldo.

Moooow_Montoya,JuanPabloMontoya,Juan Pablo Montoya,"Basically this.

He was not the most focused driver, not the best allround driver, not the calmest driver and not the best driver. But I honestly can't remember a driver that wild and reckless (actually I can, his name is Max). When he and Fernando and Kimi joined F1 those were the  drivers that would challenge Michael. Kimi and Fernando only occasionally (and especially with Alonso you could see that he had a lot of respect for Schumi), but JP did it all the time. And Michael didn't really have that before. He enjoyed his fair and square rivalry with Häkkinen they always showed respect during driving, he had clashes with Hill and Villeneuve, but not that many and not over such a period of time.

Brazil 2001 was his third (?) race, he did similar  in Europe 2003, Italy 2003, San Marino 2004, Belgium 2004 (and probably also a few times in 2002, but I am no expert on that season), these being the ones I immediately think of. He said that he had no respect for Michael (in terms of ""Oh, I can't do that""), but he acknowledged Michael as a rival and top class driver.

I say I would've liked to have had him in F1 for a few more years, but when the motivation's gone, the wildness would also be gone. Right now I am happy we have Verstappen who has that same spirit, although in contrast to JP, Verstappen has to acknowledge his own mistakes.

EU has enough geopolitical and economic clout to not only make such regulation, but also see it enforced realistically. Even then it will be a strugle to enforce on say a company that has no branch in EU and only accesses EU market via internet services. Still EU can have some confidence on atleast somelevel of enforcement.

Case in point from the article. EU sees this enforced for Japanase corporations, because Japan and EU negotiated a FTA and EU put GDPR enforcement as one conditions for agreeing to said FTA.

Which pretty much means from now: you want FTA or other trade deal with EU. EU will say, well firstly you agree to our regulatory regime for your companies accessing our market including GDPR. Which pretty much makes GDPR global standard, since apporently people like to trade on favorable terms with 500 million strong trading block.

&gt; O bitcoin experimentou, novamente, uma queda vertiginosa que levou o preço da criptomoeda mais famosa do mundo para baixo dos US$ 8 mil na manhã desta sexta-feira. Como efeito, todo o mercado de criptomoedas também se desvalorizou nas últimas semanas, com as cotações de Ethereum e Ripple, segunda e terceira moedas virtuais mais valiosas do mundo, caindo 29,5% e 36,5%, respectivamente, nas últimas 24 horas (dados do CoinMarketCap). Todo o mercado de criptomoedas sofreu uma queda significativa nas últimas 24 horas. O mês de janeiro costuma ser um período de baixa para as criptomoedas, o que deixa muitos investidores tranquilos e até animados para continuar investindo no setor. Contudo, movimentações em prol da regulamentação das moedas virtuais nos Estados Unidos ou mesmo a recente proibição desse tipo de negócio na Coreia do Sul acabaram por atingir o mercado. O mercado de criptomoedas é dinâmico e instável, portanto, tanto a queda quanto a ascensão dos preços podem acontecer de forma repentina. Será que a tendência agora é cair e não se recuperar mais ou o preço mais baixo pode justamente atrair novos investidores?

theWyzzerd,,,"I worked in the NOC for a telecom and all our phone systems were owned and operated by my company.  I got a call late one night (24/7 NOC) from a scammer claiming to be from Panasonic who told me he needed my voicemail password in order to correct a problem with the Panasonic phones.

Two big problems with his plan:

1. We used Polycom phones, not Panasonic.
2. He called a phone company.

Background info: many phone systems (PBX or hosted PBX systems) have the ability to call outbound from a voicemail system.  What these scammers will do is find out the voicemail box number, then find out the password for the voicemail box.  Once they get into the voicemail box, they have complete autonomy to make calls anywhere in the world if there aren't any restrictions in place on the phone system.  This happened many times and the pattern is clear; VM gets compromised, customer's bill goes way up, then the call records show a clear pattern of calls to some country (usually either African, Eastern European, or South Asian).  Check this out for more info:  https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/voicemail-system-hacking

The way to get around this is: disable outbound voicemail calling and disable international calling (most companies have no need for it and the ones that do will make it known).",True,0,1517579009,,False,0,dtmhfla,False,t3_7upiy3,t1_dtmei8k,/r/videos/comments/7upiy3/scammer_spots_a_nudes_folder/dtmhfla/,1518856823,5,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,public,

HC: I told you so

Hillary Clinton spontaneously becomes the leader of America and defends the country against the Russians. The war that follows destroys both America and Russia, until both Putin and Clinton admit that it doesn't make any sense anymore. In the post-apocalyptical world that follows, the two leave their leadership positions and hide away from all the trouble. One day, they meet each other in a shadowy little pub somewhere in Europe (it's safer there).
