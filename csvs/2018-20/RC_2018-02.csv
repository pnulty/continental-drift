BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] privatiser in chief,"This is already a big week for Brexit. Ministers from the 27 other EU member countries have set the terms for a transitional deal until the end of 2020: that everything will remain the same except for the loss of a British vote, and voice. The only quarrel I would have is that the transition is likely to last longer. But to take phase one of Brexit as a template, it seems very likely that the government will accept the EU’s transition terms.

We also had the leak, to the website BuzzFeed, of the document EU Exit Analysis – Cross Whitehall Briefing. This showed that the economy would suffer over the coming 15 years under three scenarios: Norway-style European Economic Area membership (2 per cent lower gross domestic product than otherwise); a comprehensive free trade agreement (5 per cent lower); and no trade deal (8 per cent lower). Every region would be adversely affected, with the biggest hits in the northeast, West Midlands and Northern Ireland, and pretty well every sector of the economy.

It was a great scoop for BuzzFeed, though no surprise to economists. Overwhelmingly, credible analysis shows a similar picture. It also produced the usual nonsense, of the kind that says that if you cannot forecast next year how can you forecast for 15 years? This, of course, is not standard economic forecasting but conditional analysis, which looks at the relative difference compared with the baseline when you introduce frictions into trade with your largest trading partner, reduce your attractiveness for foreign direct investment and cut the supply of EU migrant workers. It sets that against modest gains, only over a very long period, from non-EU trade deals.

As for forecasts, although Britain has been helped by a strong world economy a standard forecast was that the economy would be 3 per cent smaller in 2020 than in the absence of a Brexit vote. That remains on track. Mark Carney says that the economy will be 2 per cent smaller by the end of this year, and that effect will build. The squeeze on real wages has returned, as predicted. That poorer and more unstable future some of us warned of is reality.

As for the government’s response, that its proposed bespoke EU deal is not modelled, it is easy to see where that would fit in, somewhere between the 2 per cent negative effect of an EEA deal (Norway) and the 5 per cent of a trade agreement (Canada).

Anyway, I shall leave people to fight that out, because it is time to come to the defence of our beleaguered chancellor. Some Tories, when they are not gunning for Theresa May, want Philip Hammond to be sacked. His latest offence was to go to Davos and apparently propose such a softly-softly approach to Brexit that it might as well not happen at all.

Any reasonable person reading the chancellor’s speech to British business people in Davos last week — and I suspect that his critics have not read it — would find little to get excited about. It was a clear exposition of the government’s approach, stressing that Britain is leaving the EU, including the customs union and single market. It emphasised, as many Brexiteers do, that Britain and the EU start from a unique position of convergence which should make a bespoke agreement easier to negotiate.

That was the context of Mr Hammond’s red-rag-to-the-Brexiteers’-bull phrase that Britain and the EU would be moving only “very modestly” apart. You would have to be very thick, or very obtuse, not to see what the chancellor was doing. He was reassuring businesses that there would not be a sudden leap into the unknown, over the cliff edge.

“Instead of doing what we’re normally doing in a trade negotiations — taking two divergent economies with low levels of trade and trying to bring them closer together to enhance that trade — we are taking two completely interconnected and aligned economies with high levels of trade between them, and selectively, moving them, hopefully very modestly, apart,” he said. “And so we should be confident of reaching something much more ambitious than any free trade agreement has ever achieved.”

It is a sign of the bonkers approach of some in the Tory party that those words produced calls for him to be sacked. It is not, however, a great surprise. Brexiteers were criticised before the referendum for not having a blueprint for Brexit. More than 19 months on that blueprint is still on the drawing board. Apart from vague talk about flouncing out of the negotiations and trading on World Trade Organisation terms, there is nothing. Tory hard Brexiteers snipe, and in doing so inhibit the prime minister from setting out her Brexit plan. They offer nothing constructive.

Those involved in the process, such as the international trade secretary Liam Fox, know that there is hard work to be done, notably the urgent task of rolling over by March 2019 the roughly 40 trade agreements that the EU has with more than 40 countries, to which Britain is a party.

The chancellor will get on with trying to keep the economy on an even keel while pushing hard for the inclusion of financial services in the eventual deal, to the benefit of both sides. Mr Hammond could never be accused of being a flashy politician. Faced with one of those quickfire interview quizzes, I suspect that he would choose Inspector Morse over McMafia and The Crown over Game of Thrones. The chances of him on Strictly Come Dancing, cavorting gangnam-style like the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, are about as likely as those of me doing so, no chance at all.

But as chancellor, he clearly has the country’s best interests at heart, and is working hard to ensure that they are protected in Brexit. I am not sure that that can be said of many of those calling for his head.

Ayy_1mao,,,"&gt;If they want to have 20% of their employees on break, that's their choice.

That's not acceptable on a project that is being funded by the state.

&gt;I imagine there are huge barriers to entry in that location, and that's why this doesn't happen?

Lets say that a bridge construction project is put up for bid.  Thankfully I habitually take several of my state reps out for drinking and pay them several thousands each month in ""consulting fees"", so ultimately no one else is going to have a chance at this bid.  The only issue is that the state has mandated that there must be at least 3 bids.  While realistically this bridge would cost $80 million to build, and in a competitive market I would probably need to bid $90-100 million, all I have to do is create fraudulent bids under shell companies at $300 and $350 million respectively and suddenly my $250 million bid seems much more reasonable.

&gt;Second, what do you think are the chances Trump or the Republican Congress would enact an anti-protectionist policy like you're suggesting encouraging foreign firms to bid for American projects?

Zero, but I expect to see some kind of legislation for expediting the process.

&gt;Also remember that when we compare US costs with costs in France or other wealthy nations, their governments provide healthcare, education, and many social programs that the US does not. This has to be taken into account when comparing an employee's salary.

This is marginal at best, it costs roughly the same (or more) to hire someone in Europe as it does in the US due to higher cost of living in almost every other aspect.  Education has virtually zero bearing on the salary of 90% of the people working in a construction firm, and healthcare becomes increasingly distributed with larger firms.

&gt;It is important to keep in mind that we still are investigating and working on this system. It is possible that this system will continue to evolve as we develop it, and we will be constantly testing to make sure the system meets our goals and our expectations for a quality experience. This post is an opportunity to share with you our plans for the new system, and respond to questions before the system is far long in the development process.
&gt;
&gt;# Restructuring Worlds
&gt;
&gt;Even though world linking has brought world populations closer together, it is impossible for us to get populations and coverage any closer because the current worlds do not give us the granularity needed to do that. For example in NA, Blackgate has decent coverage across all time zones whereas worlds like Crystal Desert have higher peak times and lower off-hour times. Because world linking isn&amp;#39;t granular enough, we don&amp;#39;t have the ideal link that allows Crystal Desert to have coverage that is similar to Blackgate.
&gt;
&gt;This is why, in the new World Restructuring system, we will remove all players from their current worlds, and make new worlds every eight weeks. This will create more granular pieces, which allow us to avoid situations like the Crystal Desert example.
&gt;
&gt;Since worlds will not exist any longer, the &amp;quot;World Selection&amp;quot; that currently is available in character select will be eliminated, and instead a selection for playing in either North America or Europe will replace it.
&gt;
&gt;### World Creation
&gt;
&gt;The system creates new worlds and assigns them a pre-generated name at the start of each season. We use &amp;#39;season&amp;#39; to describe the time between World Restructuring. We plan on eight-week seasons, which is similar to the current time between links. We will discuss more about seasons later.
&gt;
&gt;World Creation builds teams so they have similar predicted participation, skill, coverage, and language. Team assignment moves players onto teams by calculating the contribution value of a player and using that calculation to distribute players fairly. We plan to track stats like play hours in WvW, commander time and squad size, time of day, and participation levels. The exact stats have yet to be determined and we are open to suggestions of other stats to use in this system. This new system will expand upon the current calculation that uses play hours for linking.
&gt;
&gt;If a player has played WvW before, we will be able to use the statistics from their account to sort them into a new world. The system also makes a world assignment for players who have not played WvW before, when they first begin WvW. Ideally the system will assign a new player to a world on which their friends or guild mates play, thereby making it easier than it is at present for people to play with friends in WvW.
&gt;
&gt;### Playing with Guild Mates
&gt;
&gt;We want to make sure that playing with WvW guild mates is easy in this new system. Guilds will be able to specify if they are a WvW guild. This essentially means the World Restructuring system will consider that factor at the start of each season when assigning the guild to a world. On an individual player level, once a player&amp;#39;s guild has specified they are a WvW guild, the individual player will be able to set **ONE** of their guilds as their personal WvW guild. When World Restructuring happens at the start of a season, as long as you have specified your WvW guild, you will be assigned to the same world as everyone else in your WvW guild, guaranteeing you will be able to play with your guild mates.
&gt;
&gt;### Creating Alliances
&gt;
&gt;We also want to make sure that existing WvW communities can play together in this new system. A WvW guild will be able to invite other WvW guilds to their WvW Alliance. WvW Alliances function as a party for guilds. When World Restructuring happens, the system assigns all members in the WvW guilds that make up the WvW alliance to the same world. These WvW alliances will have certain restrictions on them, such as a finite number of guilds or number of players. Our current plans for alliance size are somewhere between 500-1000 members, and we are still considering the technical and match-making ramifications of the number that we settle upon.
&gt;
&gt;### World Creation Summary
&gt;
&gt;So to summarize world creation: at the start of every season our new World Restructuring system will use recent statistics, based on similar predicted participation, skill, and coverage, to create worlds filled with alliances, guilds, and unaffiliated players.
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/a3c5eWvW\_image1.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The above graph displays an example of what makes up a world under the World Restructuring system. Keep in mind, due to the algorithm used to keep worlds balanced, the number of alliances, guilds, and individual players can be wildly different between worlds, but the participation and playtime should be relatively the same.
&gt;
&gt;# Seasons
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/51132WvW\_image2.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Seasons break WvW into cycles where several matches will play out. The current design for seasons is 8 weeks, but we are open to feedback. Matches are still a week long, so there would be eight matches a season in the above scenario. During the season, we will still be using 1-up, 1-down.
&gt;
&gt;### Stages:
&gt;
&gt;1. **Season**
&gt;  1. Once new worlds have been created and everyone has been sorted onto their WvW worlds, the new season has officially began.
&gt;  2. During a season players can manage their WvW guilds and alliances after reset and through the end of Week 7, but their WvW guild and WvW alliances will not be updated until the start of the next season.
&gt;    1. Ex: If you are playing WvW with Guild A this season and decide to set Guild B as your WvW guild in the middle of the season, you will not be able to play with Guild B until the next season, unless you transfer (more about that later).
&gt;2. **Season End**
&gt;  1. A week before the season ends, that is, during Week 8 in the season, you no longer will be able to manage your WvW guilds or alliances. Your WvW guild and alliances will be locked down at this time.
&gt;  2. Everyone is kicked out of WvW, as they are with every reset. WvW will spin back up, as it currently does after reset, and everyone will now be sorted into their new worlds.
&gt;3. **World Creation**
&gt;  1. Alliances, guilds, and individual players are sorted to be on a world.
&gt;  2. This will happen at the same time as current WvW reset.
&gt;
&gt;# Transfers
&gt;# &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;### Region Transfers
&gt;
&gt;Transferring between regions, from NA to EU, will still exist. We have not determined the costs for transferring but a region selection will be available on the character select screen that will allow transfers.
&gt;
&gt;### World Transfers
&gt;
&gt;We understand that even though this system tries to keep guilds and alliances together, there will be times during the season when people want to change teams. Because of this, there are plans to allow transfers between worlds during a season. This means that new worlds will have size restrictions on them, as they do currently.
&gt;
&gt;Players will be able to select worlds from the WvW panel in game. Worlds that are available for transfers will show up in the new WvW world panel. Worlds can be in these three different states:
&gt;
&gt;![](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dbcd7table\_WvW.png """")
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The cost of transfer worlds has not been determined.
&gt;
&gt;# Transitioning to this System
&gt;
&gt;This system is going to take time to make. As mentioned in the WvW FAQ, part of the reason we did World Linking was because it utilized a lot of existing tech and did not require a considerable amount of time. This allowed us to address the growing population issue quickly, while also being able to address other WvW issues. This new system is going to take considerably more time to make. We do not have a release date, but this is going to require several months of work and it will share resources with any other WvW changes that we work on.
&gt;
&gt;Transitioning to this system is going to be slow and we want to make this transition as smooth as possible. Once this system is ready, we plan to give everyone several weeks to form their WvW guilds and alliances. We also want to give titles related to the worlds on which players currently are playing when World Restructuring goes live. If there are other transition ideas, we would love to hear them!
&gt;
&gt;We will continue with World Linking until World Restructuring is ready to ship.
&gt;
&gt;# Feedback
&gt;
&gt;That was a lot of information and I am sure there are many questions. The team will do its best to answer them. We appreciate any feedback on this system. Your opinions of this system, as well as the community&amp;#39;s response, will be an important part of how we tackle this project.

Depends which country/region you're talking about.

In Europe more than 50% of electricity is renewable or nuclear, for example. We definitely want electric cars.

If you look up trends in solar energy price too, you'll see they are still dropping over time, and some fairly believable calculations say that we'll be generating 90-100% of energy for cars (well, probably everything) by solar in the next 10-15 years.

Fossil fuels are only going to continue becoming more expensive over time if demand stays high, yet renewables and nuclear have the possibility to become cheaper even under growing demand.

lowlandslinda,,,"This article seems very layman-y. I have two problems with it.

The article alleges that Scandinavia's role is ""covert"", yet offers no evidence for that. Maybe it is covert to Americans who think Dutch people live in Denmark, but even as a non-Scandinavian European I already knew that H&amp;M's workers suffer bad conditions, that Norway participated in recent wars, that only Sweden was enthusiastically welcoming to refugees, and so on. 

""The Nordic Model"" is seen as an example for **social democracy**, not for foreign policy. Social democracies are reliant on strict border and immigration control to work. They are in no way capable of taking care of all the refugees in the world or even capable of accepting substantial numbers of migrants. Migrants don't join unions in European countries, do not have law of Jante ingrained in them, reduce social cohesion, and thus reduce the willingness to care for each other economically. Migrants also create proletariats (social subclasses) in the countries they migrate to, thus becoming very expensive to governments, threatening the model. For instance, many of the Turkish and Moroccan migrants that came to Europe in the 20th century weren't even literate in their own language, let alone them having potential to be literate in the European languages. It's pretty hard to provide social services such as health care to people when they cannot read, nor speak well. Mass migration would absolutely be the downfall of the Scandinavian model. Scandinavians know this, which is why there has been a major shift from social democratic parties to conservative parties. Labour party always was the largest in Norway up until 2013.

I also disagree somewhat with the assertion that Scandinavia's social model doesn't apply to their capitalist multinationals.

Hitler did actually have some fairly reasonable claims to the sudetenland, although his plan was probably ultimately to cease and easily bypass the new Czech defenses they built for specifically this scenario his claim wasn't exactly unreasonable from a German perspective just like ceasing Poland isn't unreasonable from yours.

The big difference is that the Soviets had something to gain and Poland was in their sights since the early 20s and probably before. Nobody can really say certainly what the reasons were since both nations were secretive and destroyed documentation of these sorts of events regularly, but it's undeniable that Stalin had either the same or similar plans to Hitler. Work together to cease and divide Poland, then when the time is right and your military was strong enough stab the other in the back and keep pushing.

 Britain was pretty clearly just trying to buy time, and obviously from my western perspective is really the most reasonable thing to happen in the lead up to all out war in Europe.

_Ausencia_,,,"A nota do ENEM pode ir pra 3 coisas: Sisu, fies ou prouni. 

De maneira bem fuleira:
___________________
**Sisu=**

Te permite entrar em federais/estaduais. 


No geral todos podem participar, mas alguns cursos em algumas faculdades reestringem algumas vagas somente para cotistas. 

A maior parte universidades oferecem uma porcentagem de vagas por ele.É como se fosse um vestibular alternativo (por exemplo, você pode entrar na USP pela fuvest ou pelo sisu, mas a maior parte das vagas disponíveis são pela fuvest)


 O funcionamento é simples, cada curso atribui um peso  para cada parte da prova do ENEM e a sua nota final no SISU é a soma de quanto tirou em cada parte do ENEM, sendo que o peso de cada parte pode variar.

(A formula para somar sua nota final é bem complicada, existem simuladores na internet que te ajudam, pesquisa ai ''simulador nota enem sisu'')

**Por exemplo, você tirou 500 em todas as partes do ENEM, mais 300 na redação.**

Pra cursar Fisica na USP pelo SISU o peso de matemática é 2 e o da redação é 1. Pra esse curso, sua nota foi 700

Pra cursar Filosofia, matemática tem peso 1 e redação peso 4.  Pra esse curso, sua nota foi 400

Partindo dai, o funcionamento é bem simples. Com um clique você se inscreve no curso, as notas mais altas ficam com as vagas. Se tem 10 vagas, as 10 maiores notas ficam com elas. 

O termo nota de corte se refere ao ultimo colocado dessas vagas, ou seja cara com a nota mais baixa possível. 
Como isso tende a manter um padrão, se usa essa nota de corte como um parâmetro para o próximo ano. Se o ultimo colocado de 2017 tirou 800, o ultimo colocado de 2018 dificilmente tira mais que 850 ou menos que 780. 
Logo, eu sei que a nota mínima que eu preciso tirar pra estar entre as 10 vagas do sisu 2018 é 800, é o mínimo que vai me permitir ser pelo menos o ultimo colocado. Logo, a nota de corte desse curso é 800.
___________________________________________

**Prouni=**




Um sistema que garante bolsas em particulares, integrais ou parciais (o governo paga parte ou toda a sua faculdade) 

**Só pode participar do Prouni se você:**
&gt; Ter tirado mais que 400 no enem (mais uma vez, use simuladores online pra saber sua nota final)


 &gt; Ter cursado o ensino médio completo em escola da rede pública.
   
&gt;Ter cursado o ensino médio completo em escola da rede particular, na condição de bolsista integral da própria escola.
   
&gt;Ter cursado o ensino médio parcialmente em escola da rede pública e parcialmente em escola da rede particular, na condição de bolsista integral da própria escola privada

Se não atende a esses critérios não pode participar do Prouni de nenhuma forma

**Só pode concorrer a bolsa integral quem:**

&gt; O candidato deve ter renda familiar bruta mensal de até um salário mínimo e meio por pessoa. 


Você soma qual sua renda bruta mensal com essa fórmula:

Valor que as pessoas que moram com você ganham ao todo / número de pessoas que moram na sua casa. 

Exemplo:

Mora pai mãe e filho

Pai ganha 100, mãe ganha 100, filho ganha 100


100+100+100/3= 233 de renda bruta familiar

O salário minimo do meu estado é 800, posso concorrer, é menor que um salário minimo e meio, ou seja, menor que 1200(800+400)

Para saber quanto é o salario mínimo, pesquise por estado ""salario minimo sp""


**Só pode concorrer para no máximo bolsa parcial quem:**

&gt;Para as bolsas parciais (50%), a renda familiar bruta mensal deve ser de até três salários mínimos por pessoa.




Mesmo esquema, mas sua renda bruta tem que dar no máximo 3 salários mínimos.   




Partindo disso, o quanto de bolsa que você vai ganhar depende da faculdade, cada um tem um critério praticamente.

FFS, if it wasn't for the weather, I'd seriously consider UK/Ireland or Germany/EU.  This is worst case scenario in a lot of ways for the UK; the horror of the bureaucracy.  That's the best they can sling at us.  My wife's family is all in a UK decaying steel town reminiscent of Rochester or Toledo.  Her parents make about a pound over minimum working an entry position at a coffee packing company.  They rail about non-English speaking peers and voted for Brexit.

Biggus_TM,striker,,"**1) How long have you been on reddit?** 3 almost 4 year's.


**2) Why do you want to be a mod here?** BDO is my main game, and even when it's not I browse this sub numerous times a day because I like to read up on the latest things. I would love to give back and help the community.


**3) Do you have any previous moderation experience? If so:** Yes but not on reddit.


**3a) Biggest sub you modded, and how many users?** I own the Foreigner sub but it is essentially just for posting their music videos so just 5 people. Site I moderated had 50,000 active users in the forum with 100,000 person traffic a week.


**3b) How long have you been a moderator?** N/A


**3c) What were your responsibilities?** I was the sole curator, meaning I archived dead threads, cleaned up drama, as well as deleted rule breaking threads and took action on those that did so. I was essentially the only moderator with full admin access without being an admin on the site.


**3d) Experience with toolbox?** No but willing to learn.


**4) Timezone?** Est and am on throughout the day 10 a.m to 11 a.m


**5) Any experience with the following: CSS/Automod** No, but again willing to learn.


**6) What ideas do you have to improve the sub?**  Honestly the sub has mostly everything it needs. The only real thing I can think of is improve the wiki by generic class skill guides. As well as an optimal gearing guide. I also think a low effort post rule needs to be made. As well as allowing the deletion of answered question posts to clear up some junk.


**7) How would you react to a situation where an exploit is discovered in game and is quickly being spread throughout the forums and subreddit? How would you react to the witchhunting that follows, whether there is evidence to support the accusation or not?** It depends on who the person exploiting is. If it is a public figure like a streamer that puts themself out there, and there is clear evidence supporting this person I don't thing censoring is the right thing. Mainly because they choose to be in the spot light and need to be held to higher standards. If it is a random person no matter the evidence the thread should be locked and direct the poster to the correct people to deal with it.


**8) Some new items and locations from a future expansion are revealed in a major leak. The devs message you requesting that all leaks be removed from the sub. How do you respond?** This is a tricky question. Some subreddits have close relationships with the games developer to the point where they get incentives for helping with the sub. If that is the case you should remove the leaks because you have a working relationship. If that is not the case and there is no prior arrangement then there is no reason to remove the links.


**9) Anything else you want to say?** While I do not fall under the European time zone, I am on all day. I am a full time student and have access to my laptop during all class. So I am essentially on and browsing from 10 A.M Est-11:00 P.M Est. Sometimes earlier sometimes later. While I have yet to moderate any Reddit community I think I would be a great fit from my previous moderation position, and would love the chance to give it a shot. I also want to emphasize even when I take a break from BDO I am always active on the sub reading and sometimes responding to posts. It is one of the few games I care about while not actively playing.

Also I didn't mean literally, I just use shame as a choice of words to describe how it feels to be a mother that gets nagged about how breastfeeding is like sex. Which can be annoying to some people that aren't that sensitive to nudity, or don't believe breastfeeding to be wrong, also funny thing is that Europe actually has nude beaches where people actually walk around naked.

Look dude, I think you just have to accept it. We can't make all women pump feed because not all women can do that. And it's not right to dictate what all women can't or can do. Do you ever wish you weren't so sensitive to nudity? I get that this ain't Europe, so we can't just completely get rid of the idea of indecency. However there should be exceptions such as when a baby needs to eat or when they're prepubescent. 

Also because you seem to really dislike nudity, like just a bare naked male chest would be off putting to you. I've found that looking at yourself naked or regular pictures of naked people (not pornography). Kind of helps to desensitize yourself because although it's still weird to look at, it starts to become just another body part. But it's your choice to desensitize yourself, not mine. It's also a mother's choice to breastfeed and not anybody else's.

“There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,” Trudeau said, concluding that he sees Canada as “the first post-national state.”

Even the New York Times called the suggestion “radical.”

aristotle_of_stagira,,,"This has the potential to be a good discussion, since you are really interested in the topic and not an ideologue, which is rare in the discussions surrounding the topic online.

I am kind of busy currently and I have some deadlines due so I might come back a week or so later to build up on several misunderstandings that dominate this topic because of the disconnect it has with actual biological research (look up papers on the genotype to phenotype map if you are interested), which is because most of the arguments come from behavioral geneticists (who are not geneticists or biologists, rather they are clinical psychologists in training) and political scientists.

So let me briefly reply.

&gt; There's a purely instrumental sense in which I certainly can: if we are going to bet on IQ of a random American citizen being above/below 95, and I'm allowed to know their folk race (and only that), and you're not, then I'm going to rob you blind. And if you object about nature vs nurture and proxies for poverty, then we can bet on adoptees' IQ, and I get to know their race and you get to know their adoptive parents' socioeconomic status, and I will rob you bliiiiiind. I hope we agree on this fact?

When I say proxies for phenotypic differences there, I should have clarified in retrospect, what I mean is as a proxy for their genetic potential (whatever that means, I would say innateness but there are [issues](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1563/436) with using such terms that cut right through the current consensus on the false dichotomy of nature vs nurture, related to the literature on genotype to phenotype map), rather than the phenotype in itself. I completely agree that race as a social variable has predictability on the distribution of intelligence as measured by IQ tests, but it doesn't follow that this phenotypic difference is the result of their evolved genetic differences. 

And this gets to the crux of the issue. Race is more of a social variable than it is a genetic one. This is not even up for debate. The vast majority of population geneticists would agree to that, and I hope you would agree to that too (even if you do think that the IQ difference might be genetic; those statements are not contradictory). Thus, when you are using race as a genetic variable, it is strongly confounded by social factors. 

You can try to control socioeconomic status all you want, the outcome depends on how you define socioeconomic status. But in any case, IQ correlates with socioeconomic status so controlling for it properly will reduce the IQ gap. But the thing is that this is circular. Even Herrnstein and Murray in the Bell Curve go on to say that:

&gt;  We can already hear critics saying, ""If only they had added this other variable to the analysis, they would have seen that intelligence has nothing to do with X."" A major part of our analysis accordingly has been to anticipate what other variables might be invoked and seeing if they do in fact attenuate the relationship of IQ to any given social behavior.
...
At this point, however, statistical analysis can become a bottomless pit

Clark Glymour has a [nice paper](http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/what_went_wrong_reflections_on_science_by_observation_and_the_bell_curve.pdf) on causality and the Bell Curve.
In any case, in both economics and sociology, it has been mainstream for decades that socioeconomic status alone misses a lot of things like cultural transmission mechanisms, etc.

Most of the rest of your comment is based on the above misinterpretation (I should have been more clear I guess). I make no arguments about ontology in any way.

Let me elaborate on the predictive validity of race as a genetic variable. Race is commonly used as a proxy for continental ancestry. But self identified races are extremely [heterogeneous](http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929714004765/pdf) even as far as continental ancestry goes. African Americans range from 100% sub-Saharan ancestry to less than 10%. Further, continental ancestry in itself is a crude proxy for actual human genetic variation. Continental ancestral groups are *not* types, they include very genetically distant ancestral groups. This is not a matter of ontology at all. It's a pragmatic approach to understand human genetic variation and how it relates to phenotypic differences. 
So my point was that in order to have an intuition about expected genetic differences between races you need an evolutionary genetic model for the trait. We know that for the most part selection pressures have been local, not at a whole continental scale. We know that neutrality, which can be a proxy of divergence, results in very subtle differences between groups and huge differences within them. So build a model for your trait to gain intuition. (Spoiler alert: for intelligence if you build a model it shows a slight tilt for lower intelligence in Europeans compared to Africans.)

And this goes back to your example of adoptees. (edit: [interestingly](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6203/7fcba9c327f484f2aeb28aff64bc5f8f2858.pdf) this review of transracial adoption studies seems to report no effect of race as a variable, though the author admits that the datasets are noisy and scarce) You think that you can bypass nature vs nurture via controlling socioeconomic status of adoptive parents, this couldn't be further from the truth. Nearly all race disparities in America exist even if you control for socioeconomic status, even the ones that are not correlated with IQ. This is nothing new. The fact that controlling for socioeconomic status doesn't erase the disparities is not something intelligence researchers just discovered, it was known all along. 
And all this relates to the complexities and non-linearity of the genotype to phenotype map (significantly studied currently in biology with really amazing literature as far as evolutionary biology goes) and to [how](http://sci-hub.la/10.1002/ajpa.20983) race becomes literally biology as an embodiment of social inequality.

&gt; This means that your incorrect worldview supports policies wasteful for the society and harmful to minorities themselves, because if you want to be biased in favor of minorites you still have to be at least somewhat in touch with the reality, if you aren't then your policies will backfire more often than not, for example by disproportionately excluding low SES minorities or causing high drop out rates (further reading).

I am not in support of affirmative action so there's that. I am not aware of the literature about it, so I cannot really comment on this. I completely agree with the fact that we need to have policies based on empirical facts.

&gt; Furthermore, given the worldwide resurgence of racism and fascism, I don't think that fighting it with bullshit is a good idea, because that's going to push everyone who sees through it if not straight into Nazi clutches but definitely away from your side. And you're disproportionately pushing away more intelligent people which is even more dangerous.

I am not fighting anything with bullshit. I am trying to dispel common misconceptions.

I have explicitly said before that the debates about IQ and race are besides the point because it's like arguing with rapists whether rape is in human nature or not. Or arguing with serial killers, whether them being who they are is in their DNA, therefore they are justified and should be allowed to do what they are doing.

&gt; And the second main thing bothering me is that by framing the discussion this way you tacitly accept the Nazi core premise, that if the clustering had ontological merit then it would be OK for them to discriminate, enslave, genocide.

See above why this is not true. I couldn't agree more that arguing about discriminating people based on their race is akin to arguing about legalizing murder or rape and it's out of the discussion.

&gt; As I said in my first comment here, I understand perfectly why are you doing this: moral theories can't be defended with empirical facts so you are wary of having to defend yours, but on the other hand there are all those empirical facts that seem to allow to render the whole point moot. Except not really, so you're opening yourself to trouble if the nazis say that they don't care about ontology and are perfectly content to have their white ethnostate if that means that they and their friends are in and enjoy lower levels of criminality (note that worse, that doesn't even have to rely on biological determinism at all!), or if they find a passable ontology here or in other social spheres, or when people notice that this is sort of a bullshit argument as per above.

And as I said above, I am not. I am trying to dispel common myths perpetuated by racists (and popularized by scientific racists) that try to use sciencey words to borrow the cultural authority of science in order to justify their actions. Not only their moral philosophy is repugnant, but their empirical outlook is invalid (at least currently).",True,0,1517465736,,1517642951,0,dtk6wy6,False,t3_7tt64p,t1_dtim51o,/r/Drama/comments/7tt64p/jeanfrancois_gariepy_jf_vs_geneticist_from/dtk6wy6/,1518816957,3,False,Drama,t5_2rd2l,public,

Absolutely *disgusting* - pissing in streets, loud, uncouth mannerisms, RUDE ""lad types"", drinking until falling down, dress incredibly TRASHY (especially the over tanned women), have sex with anything that moves...no, we're known as Europe's least favourite holiday-goers (a title we've always placed first in) and it is well deserved. It makes me highly embarrassed. Painful, just *painful*

**Germans** and **Aussies**. One thinks no end of their country or themselves, act highly entitled and believe it is their business to know everything about American politics and where you stand on them. Often blunt to the point of extreme rudeness as well. As for **Aussies**, again - think no end of themselves, cocky and arrogant. They have this holier-than-thou attitude to America (despite sucking up all aspects of said American culture) and the white/white passing ones can be highly racist. 

**Indians** No manners, rude, do no understand the concept of waiting for your turn. Older Indians especially are unfriendly, can be racist to blacks/other Indians and generally have no sense of personal space.

EmotionalChainsaw,,,"To add my two cents

1. The Blade Itself is the first book in a trilogy of three books. Then three standalones.

2. It is a military story, an adventure story, a comedy, a drama... it's hard to classify. It's got everything. Book two involves a huge quest of some of the most well written, best characters in fiction. The standalone's are broken down into three types of books, as quoted by the author. Best Served Cold is a thriller, The Heroes is a military/battlefield type story and Red Country is a weird mix of the medieval Europe and American Western, and it works very well.

3. There are a race of monsters that are mixed throughout the series but that's pretty much it for monsters and beasts. There is a very powerful magical artifact that the story centers around quite a bit, a couple characters have the ability to cast spells and there is low key magic but it's very realistic in it's use.

Overall, it doesn't matter what you are really looking for or hoping for. I promise, if you read these books they will be some of the best fiction you've ever read in any genre. You'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't. And I highly suggest you listen to the audiobook versions.

Fear of humans was really important for the survival of the species. The reason Africa has so much more megafauna is because they evolved alongside humans and had time to evolve a fear of us. Our progression from the middle of the food chain to the top took 100'000s of years. 

But the Mammals on Australia and America didn't have that luck. We arrived there in an instant. Why should they fear this little two legged thingy?

Look at the percentages of megafauna we drove to extinction on each continent between 50'000 to 2000 years ago:

* In Subsaharan Africa, 8 of 50 (16%) genera of mammalian megafauna were driven to extinction.
* In Asia, 24 of 46 (52%)
* In Europe, 23 of 39 (59%)

What a melodrama. Oh, so you won't consider or mention Flash Gaming as a representative of China because it doesn't fit your pointless narrative, right? Actually, at this point I'm not sure what the narrative is.

The article is a prime example of titlegore. The author goes on a tangent about how to keep gamers entertained at an eSports event. There is a slight digression about a Trump fan (yawn, so one person is annoying) but it feels pointless and the author talks about photo booths (?). The overarching point here is that main entertainment comes from the US Air Force sponsor.

&gt;The fandom for Counter-Strike does seem to be predominantly American.

False. It's likely plurality European, and this is reflective in viewership statistics but nice try.

&gt;The arena’s attendees also looked a lot whiter and dudelier

Can you get to the fucking point?

&gt;I don’t have a full ethnographic breakdown of who attended the event, but I can tell you that the line for the women’s bathroom never exceeded a five-second wait time.

Same at TI and every major, Dota or CSGO, I've been to. Are you sure you know what you're talking about? Now you're ranting about gender and haven't gotten to the point.

Or ignore it and watch the game. Look, as a non-American I also found the Air Force sponsorship weird and oddly targeted to a vulnerable, young, and impressionable demographic likely predisposed to joining the Armed Forced. But what you're complaining here boils down to a few things: you feel lack of inclusion, you don't like a sponsor, and you found a few fans annoying.

They knew they were actively _developing_ one, and it was only a matter of time. They knew that Stalin, at least, was ruthless and ambitious dictator, who had demonstrated his willingness to wage total war. They knew that communism had as an explicit, stated goal the elimination of capitalist societies. They had just led the US in a catastrophic total war against different enemies, both of whom were also totalitarian countries who were hostile to democratic, capitalistic societies, both of which started far behind the US and UK, and then built up their forces and attacked like clockwork--one of them for the second time in as many generations.

War must have seemed absolutely inevitable to some of the generals, and not without reason.

Now, _in that context_, can you see how they might have thought ""we should get this over with now, while we still have a major advantage""?

&gt; Regurgitator are an Australian alternative rock band from Brisbane, Queensland. The band was formed in late 1993 by core members Quan Yeomans (vocals, guitar, electronics) and Ben Ely (vocals, bass, electronics). Martin Lee played drums until departing in 1999 after recording ...art and the subsequent tour. He was replaced by current drummer Peter Kostic (Front End Loader, Hard-Ons). The band also featured Seja Vogel (Sekiden, Seja) on keyboards and backing vocals from 2006 to 2010; and was featured on their album Love and Paranoia. She also accompanied them on the Retrotech tour and various one offs when suitable.   The touring band has also been supplemented by various extra players over the years the most notable being their first additional keyboardist Shane Rudken (Ponyloaf, Emporium) for a few years in the late 90s.

&gt; They have released numerous EPs and albums that they have recorded in dubiously idiosyncratic scenarios: Tu-Plang (1996) in the remote jungle outside Bangkok; the triple platinum selling Unit (1997) in a condemned Fortitude Valley warehouse as wreckers waited outside; …art (1999) in a sun soaked Byron Bay beach house lapping up the waves; Eduardo &amp; Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks (2001) in the thick cigar smoke of Andy Gill’s London lounge-room; the post Warner release of Mishmash (2004) done in a glass box in Federation Square as part of the disturbing Band in a Bubble parody of reality shows and it’s way before it’s time multiple streaming media mayhem; Love and Paranoia (2007) in a bullet riddled studio in Rio de Janeiro under the looming rock arms of Corcovado; SuperHappyFunTimesFriends (2011) in their home studios over a period of 3 weeks sparked after a debate about whether what they were doing constituted an album; to their most recent and possibly final twisted piece of mangled pop culture Dirty Pop Fantasy (2013) recorded high in an Hong Kong skyscraper and then mixed on the streets of Melbourne… all of this long with their first 2 EPs (Regurgitator and New), the Olympic induced Crush the Losers, the manic EPs Bong in my Eye and Distractions… and the Warner destroying Jingles compilation (2003). 

&gt; In the past 20 or so years they have toured all over Australia, New Zealand, Japan, UK, Europe, USA, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Laos and other parts of Asia. Late 2009 they played a small festival in the Japanese Alps with Hoodoo Gurus… before working with dance choreographer Gavin Webber on the live music/dance/theatrical project Rock Show at QPAC in Brisbane. In 2010 they performed a highly successful live soundtrack to Japanese anime film AKIRA at Sydney Opera House. They then decided to give up the album style of approach announcing they would just release tracks… with a batch coming out under the title Distractions as they toured Australia, played festivals and took off for shows in London, Dubai and Bahrain… returning for Festival of the Sun in Port Macquarie. 2011 started in Brisbane with a huge two night flood benefit show and a massive 3 song set at the Brisbane Soccer Grand final that they won in an exciting penalty shoot out. The seventh album SuperHappyFunTimesFriends released on vinyl, cassette, download and a playable badge (playbutton) which set them off on a trajectory of touring – the sold out national Annual Sail tour with NZ guest Disasteradio - possibly their most enthusiastically received tour and release for some years. Regurgitator’s UNIT was voted #10 on the Triple J Top 100 Australian albums coincided with performances of the album “UNIT” over Falls &amp; Southbound festivals for the end of 2011. 2012 kicked off with the Big Day Out tour – their 6th time around - plus performances at the Margaret River Surf Classic, Red Deer Festival in Qld before touring seminal albums Tu Plang and Unit – The Retrotech2012 tour (with special guests from Indonesia Senyawa and China Hedgehog) was highly successful with the majority of shows sold out. Following this with the hot spot on the sold-out 2012 Meredith Music Festival. 

&gt; The past few years have seen Regurgitator do some superfluous shit. It’s all pretty interesting – the costume changes, the gimmicky record and release strategies, the full-album live sets – but tonight they achieved something far more pure. In straight power-trio formation (no spandex onesies, no heavy metal wigs), they performed what could well be the set of their careers. Hearing thousands sing along to I Will Lick Your Arsehole never gets old. They’re a punk band at heart, and one of the finest this country has produced. (Beat Magazine Dec 2012)

&gt; In April 2013 they headed out on the rural Groovin’ The Moo festival tour and released album #8 Dirty Pop Fantasy September 2013… followed with national Dirty Pop Tour with guest from Portland Wampire… ending up playing their last show for who knows how long as part of a short Asia tour in Beijing mid December 2013 with friends New Pants.

&gt; TONEDEAF: “You might not even be aware of your inner dark pop fantasies, but Regurgitator’s sensational new opus will definitely awaken them. In 2013, Gurg’s raw authenticity is still in perfect condition” 8.5/10
BEAT MAG: Dirty Pop Fantasy soaks up forty years of pop from Austin to Zurich, wringing out familiar tunes strained of cliché. They're winking at you going ""Your kiss like a Caramel Twix,  sweeter than a Kinder Surprise”. The 'Gurge’s Dirty Pop Fantasy isn't simply a label – it's their bony fists banging like a gavel, demanding your ear. The nature of their fantasy is irrepressible! 

&gt; Never ones to compromise or shy away from the unusual, the untried, or any genre that infects their creative sensibility… more than ever they find themselves extending the vitality of their live performances, continuing to infuse them with exuberance, mania and their mashedup motion of rock, punk, electro, funk, pop, where it goes vibes.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Barbary slave trade**

The Barbary slave trade refers to the slave markets that flourished on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, which included the Ottoman provinces of Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania and the independent sultanate of Morocco, between the 16th and middle of the 18th century. The Ottoman provinces in North Africa were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but in reality they were mostly autonomous. The North African slave markets were part of the Arab slave trade.



European slaves were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to the Netherlands, as far north as Iceland and east into the Mediterranean.

&gt; ""And that's precisely what the European Union, in my view, should be doing its best to undermine"" 

I'm not sure 'be more like the United States and stop fostering a view of difference from others' is the same as advocating for unlimited migration to satisfy diversity, but rather encouraging an openness to diversity so that 'migrants can choose states', rather than states control its people. 

That may be semantics, but it think one point is the suggestion that people are saying we need to satisfy diversity like some religion (and therefore we must have immigration) and the other is saying that we should be open to diversity,  to help with migration, to empower people.

_yozmo,bucuresti,B,"Toata lumea iubeste ING, sa iti zic de ce eu ii urasc.  
  
Au cea mai proasta interactiune cu clientul cand te duci in banca. Daca ai nevoie sa faci o operatiune in banca, n-o sa poti sa te duci la ce banca vrei, ci la cea la care ti-ai deschis contul. Desigur, exista posibilitatea sa-ti schimbi banca la care esti alocat, dar sunt situatii in care e nevoie sa te duci de 2 ori sa iti rezolvi o treaba. Pe langa asta, au niste angajati foarte nesimtiti.  
  
Acum sa-ti explic concret pataniile mele cu ING.  
  
Acum 2 ani am avut nevoie de un credit de nevoi personale. Am ales sa incerc la ING, intrucat toata lumea o lauda. Nu aveam nevoie de multi bani, aveam salariu decent (IT cu ceva experienta, deci nu salariu de junior). M-am dus frumos la ING, am deschis un cont, am depus cererea de facut credit, fast forward cateva zile mai tarziu, cerere credit neacceptata. Am intrebat motiv, raspunsul a fost ""Nu putem sa va spunem. Nu ma lasa sistemul sa vad de ce."" Incercat la mai multe sedii ING, la niciunul nu mi s-a dat niciun minim detaliu. OK, dupa ce am facut credit la alta banca, am vrut sa imi inchid contul la ING. M-am dus la un sediu random (cel mai aproape de mine, cel de unde mi-am deschis contul era departe, era langa locul de munca precedent). Normal ca nu s-a putut. M-au trimis inapoi unde am deschis contul. M-am dus si l-am inchis acolo. Fun.  
  
Anul trecut am vrut din nou sa imi deschid cont la ING. Dus la un sediu random, nu se poate, trebuie sa va duceti unde ati avut cont prima data. Dus la alt sediu, la fel. (Le e lene sa te transfere de la sediul vechi, desi pot. Le e mult mai usor sa te trimita acolo.) Pana la urma mi-am deschis cont.  
  
Alta patanie: Urmand sa plecam din tara, am fost cu prietena la bancomat sa scoatem ceva lei sa-i schimbam in euro. Ea are cont tot la ING. Am vrut sa scoatem de pe cardul ei. Blocat card in bancomat. Era ora 7.30 seara. Am sunat la call center (dupa ce ne-am dat seama cum sa scapam de Maria). Aia incerca sa ne faca sa renuntam si sa ne convinga ca nu ne trebuie cardul. Dupa insistente, ne-a trimis intr-un mall unde ""se poate da un card inlocuitor pe loc"". Acolo surpriza. Prietena mea isi schimbase buletinul cu 3 zile in urma. ""Nu putem sa va dam card pentru ca datele nu corespund."" ""Pai schimbati datele!"" ""Pai nu putem pentru ca e ora 9"". A dat el telefoane, card nu ne-a dat ca n-aveam datele corecte si nu exista exceptie. Prietena se duce la ING a doua zi, undeva la ora 5.45-6.00 pm (banca era deschisa pana la 6.30 pm). Acolo raspunsul a fost ca nu va putem face card ca ""nu aveti datele corecte si nu vi le putem modifica pentru ca nu ne lasa sistemul pentru ca e trecut de ora X"". Am parlamentat cu aia acolo si eu si prietena mea, la care un stimabil angajat al bancii (nu cel care ne preluase pe noi) face remarca sarcastica ""Urmariti firul, domnisoara!"" Deci in conditiile in care noi am patit-o din vina lor (un bancomat care nu era nici macar inscriptionat cu ""defect""), dupa ce ca procedura lor e sa te trimita pe drumuri de 7 ori, el isi permite sa fie sarcastic. Dupa alte parlamentari cu o alta angajata de la alt sediu (""Nu putem sa va facem card aici pentru ca apartineti de sediul X""), prietena mea a reusit sa isi faca card. In total a costat-o vreo 4 zile de dus la banca (in mijlocul zilei, in pauza de masa, pentru ca daca s-ar fi dus seara ar fi primit raspunsul ""Nu putem pentru ca e trecut de ora X"" Pai de ce plm mai aveti deschis?).  
  
Desi dupa toate astea (+ fail-ul ala cand le-a picat sistemul si o zi n-ai mai putut sa folosesti cardurile lor) ii consider niste incompetenti cu angajati nesimtiti, am cont la ING pentru ca homebanking.

Illithilitch,,,"I haven't played any PbtA games really, but I am a big fan and would like to play them.

Overall, I think I have had decent experiences with D&amp;D. I've played with GMs I would consider bad in retrospect but I mostly enjoyed the games at the time. I've played 3.5, 4e, and 5e. Of those, I have enjoyed 5E the least, mostly because in many ways it is similar to 3.5 and I keep getting rules confused. 4E was so fundamentally different I didn't have that issue. I also found that I roleplayed the best in 4E--that may have been the system, or it may have just been the mix of players at the table.

Fundamentally, part of my interest in PbtA is the rule simplicity compared to crunchier systems. I know that is weird coming from a 4E fan, but it's a palate cleanser. I like to play crunchy systems, but I just can't GM them. I'm too busy, and too forgetful. Rule simplicity could also be achieved with OSR games, such as, so far my favorite OSR game (based only on reading), the Black Hack.

Another part of it is that I am honestly getting bored of fantasy not Europe. PbtA provides a flexible, leaner, framework for playing a host of different genres. OSR games seem to be based on emulating early D&amp;D--but if I want a play experience that isn't D&amp;D I'd have to do do work on flavor rewrites and I'm just not that creative. I work at an insurance company, and I honestly like math and computer programming--I can do cool stuff, but sustained creativity is not one of them. Bursts of ideas that peter out I can do, but if I'm GMing I tend to get bored a few games in.

Speaking of maths--you mentioned that in your experience, most gamers who like PbtA have had a less well rounded game experience than is typical for gamers you have met/know. At least that is my interpretation of your post, if I'm off let me know. Has it occurred to you that perhaps the gamers you know may not be a representative sample? 

Further, as far as OSR folks go--for whatever reason I have a preconceived notion that OSR games are older, perhaps more seasoned rpers who might not need/want the tools/advice PbtA provides.

&gt; Stand up. It could help you lose weight.

&gt; A 65 kg person would lose 10 kg in four years by standing instead of sitting for six hours a day

&gt; A new study published today in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology1 found that standing instead of sitting for six hours a day could prevent weight gain and help people to actually lose weight.

&gt; Prolonged sitting has been linked to the obesity epidemic, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Europeans sit for up to seven hours a day, and even physically active people may spend most of the day in a chair. 

&gt; This paper examined whether standing burns more calories than sitting. The researchers analysed results from a total of 46 studies with 1,184 participants in all.  Participants, on average, were 33 years old, 60% were men, and the average body mass index and weight were 24 kg/m2 and 65 kg, respectively.

&gt; The researchers found that standing burned 0.15 kcal per minute more than sitting. By substituting standing for sitting for six hours a day, a 65 kg person would expend an extra 54 kcal a day. Assuming no increase in food intake, that would equate to 2.5 kg in one year and 10 kg in four years.

Abstract

&gt; Background

&gt; Replacing sitting with standing is one of several recommendations to decrease sedentary time and increase the daily energy expenditure, but the difference in energy expenditure between standing versus sitting has been controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine this difference.

&gt; Designs and methods

&gt; We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for observational and experimental studies that compared the energy expenditure of standing versus sitting. We calculated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. We conducted different predefined subgroup analyses based on characteristics of participants and study design.

&gt; Results

&gt; We identified 658 studies and included 46 studies with 1184 participants for the final analysis. The mean difference in energy expenditure between sitting and standing was 0.15 kcal/min (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12–0.17). The difference among women was 0.1 kcal/min (95% CI 0.0–0.21), and was 0.19 kcal/min (95% CI 0.05–0.33) in men. Observational studies had a lower difference in energy expenditure (0.11 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.08–0.14) compared to randomised trials (0.2 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.12–0.28). By substituting sitting with standing for 6 hours/day, a 65 kg person will expend an additional 54 kcal/day. Assuming no increase in energy intake, this difference in energy expenditure would be translated into the energy content of about 2.5 kg of body fat mass in 1 year.

&gt; Conclusions

Hi Reddit, We are Dr Anne Leonard and Dr William Gaze from the European Centre for Environment and Human Health (http://www.ecehh.org/), based at the University of Exeter Medical School. We are here to answer your questions on antibiotic-resistance in coastal waters.


Bacteria that can survive in the presence of medicines (antibiotics) designed to kill them, are termed antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and are a growing threat to human wellbeing around the world. Infections caused by bacteria that survive treatment with antibiotics are difficult to cure, and can even kill people if effective antibiotics aren’t available (https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118046-woman-dies-from-infection-resistant-to-all-available-antibiotics/)


Understanding the various ways people come into contact with resistant bacteria can help develop effective strategies to control the spread of resistance. We recently published a study (Beach Bums) on resistant bacteria in coastal waters and the potential for their spread to water users. Finding that surfers, who swallow a lot of seawater when they surf, are at a much greater risk of having antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their guts compared to people who don’t go in the sea indicates that coastal waters could be an important environment in which members of the community acquire resistant bacteria.


We are looking forward to reading your questions and comments about antibiotic-resistance in the environment.

&gt; Because politicians, particularly Tory ones are often pragmatists who are reasonably able to use the lunatics who imagine shit like ""Ban immigrants"" for support whilst not thinking their plans rational or sensible.

And good Tories are smart enough to realise that multiculturalism is frankly disastrous and needs to be curtailed. They’ll also (unlike you) have the wit (unlike you) to realise that ending free movement does not equate to a migrant ban. 

&gt; This is not what was voted on. It may have been the motivation for some, and yes on the fringes were dickheads who ""voted leave to stop muslims coming here"". But even the most mentalist positions on immigration have accepted that we benefit from allowing some.

Racism? Meh, kinda [on the rise](http://www.dw.com/en/poland-racism-on-the-rise/a-36812032). And I don't think I have to elaborate on how they feel about refugees. And over here in the Western part of the Western World we've been quite busy with the #MeToo movement lately, but in Poland they just laugh at that [shit](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/03/poland-no-friend-women). Domestic violence (mostly against women) is declining, but still isn't that uncommon, even though it's supposed to be the lowest in the EU. But when you [dig a little bit deeper](http://news.trust.org/item/20140306164123-i8wuf/), you'll see something quite different... I happen to know a Polish woman who got raped, but couldn't go anywhere out of fear for the one who raped her *and* out of fear for her family, cause she wasn't married, thus not supposed to have sex at all, even though it was without her own consent. Violence in general to settle disputes isn't that uncommon to be more precise.

So, besides ultra-nationalistic, somewhat undemocratic, overly christian and a tad bit corrupt, I'd like to add they're still somewhat medieval in their behavior. Of course this doesn't go for all Polish people.

Yes, they've come a long way (with the help of billions coming from the EU, on which the current Polish government is shitting on a daily basis), but they seem to be slipping away into medieval times more and more these days, especially under the ruling Law and Justice Party, which happens to be hugely popular amongst the common man.",True,0,1517491655,,False,0,dtkj2c0,False,t3_7ugmim,t1_dtkam52,/r/europe/comments/7ugmim/its_almost_impossible_to_get_an_abortion_in/dtkj2c0/,1518822818,10,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

If you're not familiar with it, solarpunk is a science fiction genre wherein humanity has achieved harmony between nature and technology, creating a highly advanced, clean, environmentally friendly utopian society. Numbani from Overwatch is an example.

In this scenario, the German Empire was formed, later absorbed Austria and Bohemia, then evolved into a decentralized, confederal solarpunk society over the ensuing couple centuries. Significant linguistic shifts during this time also resulted in Europe becoming known as Kerovia. Don't ask why. It just happened. Thus the country's name is basically ""The Solar Autonomies of Central Europe"". The idea of Germany fell out of fashion long ago, so they changed to a more geographically-oriented title.

If we factor in the Indian origins of the Romani then we can clearly see that La Vierge Noire or black Madonna who graces churches and monasteries and holy sites throughout the world is in fact the Hindu Goddess of Death: Kali.

In India even in recent times, children have been reportedly sacrificed to the Goddess Kali.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/05/india.theobserver

Ten days ago Sumitra and her two sons crept to their neighbour's home and abducted three-year-old Aakash Singh as he slept. They dragged him into their home and the eldest son performed a puja ceremony, reciting a mantra and waving incense. Sumitra smeared sandalwood paste and globules of ghee over the terrified child's body. The two men then used a knife to slice off the child's nose, ears and hands before laying him, bleeding, in front of Kali's image.
Police in Khurja say dozens of sacrifices have been made over the past six months. Last month, in a village near Barha, a woman hacked her neighbour's three-year-old to death after a tantrik promised unlimited riches. In another case, a couple desperate for a son had a six-year-old kidnapped and then, as the tantrik chanted mantras, mutilated the child. The woman completed the ritual by washing in the child's blood.
Many of the locations where a cult of the Black Virgin exists are also places which are rumoured to feature Satanic blood rituals and human sacrifice. A prime location in particular is the Abbey of Montserrat, some 30 miles from Barcelona which Spanish researcher Alberto Canosa has connected to the high-profile murders of three young Spanish teenager girls, abducted on their way to a disco, and the enacting of Satanic ritual involving some of the most powerful people within the Spanish political and religious elite.

One of the biggest crimes in this satanic monastery happened in 1992, the famous Alcasser girls case! 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alcasser_Girls 

Satanic ritual abuse and children sacrified to madonna ""la moreneta"" still are taken in Abbey of Montserrat (Barcelona, Spain).

Roman Catholic Church is behind of these crimes. People involved in these crimes are bishops,politicians, business men, royal family and bankers from Spain.The children are sacrified in underground caves in Montserrat.

This news can be found in ABC newspaper! a famous spanish newspaper!

Ruiz Mateos, a very controversial business man, paid 30.000 euros every week until paid 600.000 euros to Abad ""Josep Maria Soler i Canals"" . Monks promised him financial successful again in a relatively short time. How? offering child sacrifices to deamons.

These lovely girls were sacrificed in a satanic ritual.Snuff movie cost 50.000 euros in the black market . Miriam had to experience terrible suffering during at least one month before death. The murders are homosexual monks, spanish bishops, catalan and spanish business men, politicians, bankers that some of them become reptilians during these satanic rituals. 

Alberto Canosa and more people are reporting these atrocities. 

Feel free to report it!


These murders were particularly shocking, due to the tortures and sexual assaults inflicted on the three young girls. The girls were abducted on the symbolic ritual date of Friday 13th November.
The Bible assigns '13' the meaning of ""rebellion against constituted authority"", 
plus the depravity that caused Satan to rebel against God.
 
The occultist assigns '6' to represent the number of man, and the number '7' to represent the number of divine perfection. Thus, as a person climbs that ""Jacob's Ladder"" toward self-perfection in the realm of the occult, the number '13' represents the state of divine perfection, self-achieved perfection, and Illumination (6+7 = 13).

http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal20.htm

The supposed murderer Alberto Angles was and apparently allowed to escape and possibly returned to his native Brazil. To add insult to injury the father of one of the murdered girls, Miriam (Mary) was actually sued by the same police force who investigated the case and apparently managed to allow a cornered killer to escape. 

'As yet unfounded theories abound, with many saying they believed Anglés and Ricart were merely the kidnappers being paid handsomely by a sadistic paedophile racket, who also paid them to take the blame for the case.

Those who believe this consider the real killers and torturers were filming their actions for snuff movies and that they were people of extreme wealth or power, influential enough that the Spanish justice system has worked to cover them up and used Anglés and Ricart as scapegoats.

But evidence made public to date appears to show it was a random brutal murder by two men with sadistic sexual tendencies.
Miriam's father was interviewed on the Valencia region's Canal 9 shortly after the girls' murder and spoke out about the cover-up theory involving influential public figures.

He was successfully sued for defamation by the police investigating the case and ordered to pay them 285,000 euros in compensation, which was eventually paid by the TV channel.

The other presumed murderer, Miguel Ricart was sentenced to 170 years in prison but thanks to the European Court of Human Rights he was released in October 2013 and is very much alive and at-large. Possibly because he was a patsy after-all so his early release was secured behind the scenes.

[deleted],,,"Um dos maiores memes da área de T.I. são os requisitos que algumas empresas publicam em vagas de emprego. Em algumas você precisa ser uma mistura de Chuck Norris com Robocop e Goku pra dar conta do recado kkkkkk 

Ao invés de analisar as vagas, analise o que anda bombando no mercado de desenvolvimento. 

Python por exemplo é uma linguagem muito promissora. 

Comece a desenvolver projetinhos próprios, crie um portfólio para testar qual é seu nível de desenvolvedor. 

As empresas hoje em dia preferem contratar um cara que tem pouca teoria mas tem muita prática e versatilidade na hora de tomar decisões do que um cara que estudou muito e não consegue assumir a frente de um problema. Afinal quem desenvolve, assume problemas a serem resolvidos. 

Então meu conselho é esse, coloque em prática tudo que você aprendeu. Seus feitos na área de tecnologia valem mais do que seu diploma. 

E jamais deixe de estudar. Alguns dos assuntos em alta são desenvolvimento para internet das coisas, android, facebook, iOS e segurança da informação. 

Eu estou saindo da área de micro eletrônica computacional para migrar pra área de desenvolvimento. Vou começar a estudar python e fazer alguns projetos para criar portfólio. Você tendo know how, o resto acontece.

ctudor,ROMA,Romania," - /u/kristynaZ, /u/Berenteb,  as far as i am aware Bucharest area is above european mean in terms of GDP PPP

&gt;The region Bucharest-Ilfov is the most developed region in Romania, with a GDP per capita of 131% of the European average.

&gt;Bucharest thus surpasses other European capitals such as Athens, where the GDP per capita reaches 98% of the EU average, Madrid (128%), Berlin (113%), or Budapest (108%), according to an analysis by the foundation Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Romania, cited by local Agerpres.

&gt;However, the rest of Romania has a GDP per capita of only 54% of the European average. The situation is even worse in regions such as the North-East, where the GDP per capita amounts to 34% or the South region, with 41%.

&gt;The over-centralization of the country’s economy in the capital is a particularity of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Nevertheless, no other country in the region records such a big income gap between the capital and the rest of the country.

&gt;In 2012, the average income per household amounted to EUR 6,300 in Bucharest, whereas it reached EUR 2,700 in the South and the Southeast regions.

&gt;The Social Monitor is a project launched by Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Romania, which shows where Romania stands compared to other states for the income difference between the capital and the rest of the country.

ASleepandAForgetting,,,"I get a little weirded out by people who think crates are ""prisons"" and can't accept that different people (and cultures) raise dogs differently. So, a few things.

1. If someone is never away from their house for more than 5-6 hours a day, how can they afford a dog? 

2. If you had a destructive dog that would say, eat through drywall, what would you do with said dog during the day while you're gone? Or if you had a dog with destructive SA, what would you do with the dog while you're away? In both of these scenarios the dogs are appropriately exercised and stimulated, they just have a tendency to destroy anything in sight when not supervised. How would you handle that?

3. Most crates aren't tiny prisons that are just barely large enough to contain the dog. Being able to stand up, turn around and lay down again is the general idea for puppies so that they are less likely to eliminate in their crate. My dogs' crates are 4' x 4' x 4'. In other words, giant. 

4. Do you think it's more cruel to crate a puppy, or to allow it free roam of the house so that it can get into something it shouldn't, resulting in a potentially fatal blockage that will require an expensive and invasive surgery to fix? 

5. You realize that most people in the US choose to stop crating their dogs as soon as the dog reaches adulthood, provided the dog can be trusted to not destroy their home, right? I know NO ONE who crates their adult dogs during the day if they don't have to.

6. You know what my adult dog did during the day when he was confined to his crate while I was at work? Slept. You know what he does now that he's not confined to his crate while I'm at work? He sleeps. *In his crate. With the door wide open.*

Overall, to each their own. I really wish people from Europe (and other 'non-crating' countries) would stop throwing heat towards dog owners in the US for crating. I could throw plenty of heat your way for endangering your puppies by giving them free roam of the house, but I don't, because I simply accept that your idea of risk and what's ""best"" for your dogs is different than my own.

blitZee,,,"As an Ex-Erasmus Mentor, here's a couple of things you might want to know: If you're able to, get an Erasmus mentor. They will (or at least try to) help you get an apartment if you don't want to live in the dormitories (which, unless you're in the Olandų st. dormitory, are in quite bad shape). Even if you're not technically an Erasmus student, you should still be able to get a mentor. Depending on how cool your mentor will be, they might take their time and show you around the city.

Having a mentor is also great since you'll always get reminded about events specifically for exchange students. First week is usually called the Orientation week where there's some sort of an event each day. This week is held to help you ease in into the student life here in Lithuania.

Other things to know in general:
Weather:
From what I've gathered, it's really similar to Canada's weather, but slightly less harsh. Usually not as cold in the winter, less snow, more rain, maybe gets slightly hotter in the summer, but usually it sits around a similar temperature range.

Shops:
As already mentioned, the main 4 shops are Lidl, Iki, Maxima and Rimi. Rimi, Iki and Maxima all share similar quality products, but Rimi is pricier than the other two. Lidl has cheap, ""knock-off"" products (that are actually pretty good), with a small twist: every week they have a different ""X Country Week"", importing some pretty sweet products (and deals) related to that country. Those are the main things to look out for and are always of higher quality than the standard mainstay products.

Transport: Again, like already mentioned, your best bet is to make use of your student discounts. Buses are 5,80 euro for an entire month of unlimited bus trips in Vilnius (during day time, doesn't apply to night buses that are available from 11pm to 3am on fri-sat). Train ticket discounts are also great when you want to travel around other cities. Closest thing to buying a car I've heard was a bunch of students renting a car to travel 'round Europe a bit on their holidays, so look into that once you're here. Traffic jams in Vilnius are actually really bad during rush hours, so I wouldn't really recommend getting a car.

Bars: While I suggest to try out the bars yourself, two of my favourite places are the BIX bar and Mr. Pub. BIX bar has a beer ""stock market"" every Tuesday and Thursday where beer prices start at a preset price, and then it goes up and down with every purchase. When purchasing beer in the ""stock market"", buy some beer in advance (aka more than one pint), since the price applies to the entire purchase and not to a single pint. The second one is simply a cozy place.

I'd probably add more to this list, but I gotta hop off now, so if you have any more questions, wanna possibly hang out when you arrive here or have questions related to studies, just shoot me a message.",True,0,1517498535,,1517498748,0,dtkoxn5,False,t3_7uc48x,t3_7uc48x,/r/lithuania/comments/7uc48x/going_on_exchange_to_vilnius_university/dtkoxn5/,1518825637,2,False,lithuania,t5_2qj20,public,

&gt; Farmers in some places in Carniola – especially near Turjak and there about – are familiar with a rare invention, which I have not seen in any other country; namely, they slide down high hills on snow in winter with incredible speed into the valley. For this purpose, they use two wooden planks, a quarter of an inch thick, half a foot wide and about five feet long. The planks are bent at the front and curved upwards. A leather strap is attached in the middle of each plank into which the foot is pushed; one such plank is attached to each leg. Furthermore, the farmer also holds a hard stick in the hands. The stick is positioned under the armpit and used for support and steering while leaning the body backwards. They thus slide or, I could also say, ski or fly down the steepest slopes”.

Gamblor29,,,"&gt; TIL Jewish Poles, Ukrainians, and Moroccans have an inherently ""longer, more direct, and more continuous attachment to the same land"" than the descendants of Jews who converted to Islam and Christians literally living in Bethlehem whose ancestors had lived there for thousands of years.

Uh, yes, that's exactly it.  The land of Israel is a fundamental part of Jewish religious, national, and cultural identity.  Jews are literally fucking named after the land.

&gt; The Zionist identity was manufactured in the 19th century, like practically every other nationalism.

Nope.  Of course if Judaism is an ethnicity or nationality, it obviously has ties to particular land inherent in the definitions of ethnicity/nationality.  But often anti-semites like to limit Jews to being merely a belief system or religion.  But even then they're brutally, brutally wrong.

Two of the fundamental prayers in Judaism are the [Shema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael#Content) and the [Amidah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah#Structure_of_the_weekday_Amidah).  The text of both of those prayers, recited three times daily by Jews for millenia, revolves entirely around the Jewish people being in and returning to the land which they were exiled form - the land of Israel.  This isn't new, this is really, really OLD. And its been largely unchanged since before Arabs even existed.  So, yes, the attachment is longer, more direct, and more continuous than any converts.

Wait, is your position that the Jews of Europe aren't ethnic/genetic Jews?  The Khazar thing?  You know that the only people who believe that are the crazy died-in-the-wool Jew haters, right?

&gt; You mean settler lives. Their predicament is the product of their social status as settler colonists. Mandela didn't hate white people, he hated settler colonists who were white.

Wait, Jews returning to their homeland are settler colonists, while Arabs with names like al-Mughrabi and al-Masri and little blonde girls named Tamimi are indigenous?  uh okay.  I wonder if you also think that native rights and land reclamations in North America is settler colonialism.

&gt; At least you're honest about wanting to utterly and completely wipe a people from the face of the earth. And it's clear, based on this genocidal imperative, that your allegations of not caring about Jewish lives is pure projection.

HailSatanLoveHaggis,,Treasonous Vegetarian,"&gt;You think an independent Scotland will find £10bn in extra tax revenue in the first year of independence?

Never said that. I'm not dismissing a period of adjustment and reduced spending.

&gt;Both GERs and Brexit reports clarify how much we receive from being part of the UK and EU respectively, and therefore how much we'd lose by leaving them. That's how I drew my conclusion.

While ignoring changes to revenue through control over our own economy

&gt;Such as?

I thought you were supposed to be informed? The Scottish Government has screeds of data outlining Scotland's resources, economy and trading figures.

&gt;That's the real answer.

&gt;You can't be arsed hunting any data out whatsoever. You never did.

&gt;Your belief that Scottish independence is a better option than remaining part of the UK is pure dogma. It isn't based on any figures or research because you haven't bothered to do any.

&gt;Which is why you can't name any of these figures you claim support your position. 

&gt;And the only reports you can think to name are the ones I mentioned first, even though they don't discuss the topics you're claiming to be informed about.


Stale bait. I've read plenty on the performance of the Scottish economy, as have you. The reason I'm not doing it is because you're not interested in reading them. You're trying equate my genuine lack of interest in jumping through your hoops with an inability to provide said data that both you and I have read, and anyone reading this familiar with your posting style also knows you have read. Most people on this board know exactly what you're like. You always do this; ask for clarification on every single little detail in an attempt to paint the person you are debating with into a corner (and to absolve yourself of any responsibility for backing up your own points, beyond one sentence responses and more questions), and when provided with what you've asked for simply ignore it and start questioning something else. That's why I'm not doing it.

You also know that's why you are doing it. If I do it, you'll ignore them and feel smug you got me to search and post, and if I don't you get to accuse me of being an uninformed ideologue. That's why your usual deliberately contrite and obtuse answers became a mini-rant by your standards when you thought you'd got me. You can deny it all you want, but you got a bit excited and showed your hand. We've seen each other discuss sourced figures before. This is pure pantomime on your part, that's why I'm not playing :)

Side note, since you're in Germany - there's been a trend of people producing hypertype Great Danes and passing them off as ""traditional"" Danes, or ""European"" Danes. You might even see some of these dogs in the show ring (although they're more common in France). 

The FCI and AKC standards for Great Danes are nearly identical. There is no such thing as a ""European"" type and an ""American"" type. Well-bred Great Danes should look as much [like this](http://www.gdca.org/images/dogbitch1.gif) as possible (obviously with uncropped years, since you're in Germany).

Breeders producing these types of psuedo-Danes are doing a disservice to the breed. These exaggerated Danes with heavy bone weight are known for having dysplasia and heart problems. 

[This blog](https://greatdanegnosis.wordpress.com/) by Maria Gkinala, a well-known figure in the world of Great Danes, goes into depth about the problems the breed is facing today.

devlifedotnet,,No Party Affiliations. Vote Based on Sensible Policy,"&gt; No need to be condescending, I understand fully ""how the EU works"", that's why I voted to Leave with such relish in 2016. I'd been waiting for 25 years for the chance to vote on it!

Ok, I'm curious, seeing as you seem to know what you're talking about, why are you so keen on leaving? nobody's ever expressed a coherent argument as to why this whole thing is a good idea from a logical or quantifiable standpoint... i mean one beside the general ""we don't like immigrants"" which i think is more ideological than logical (and i think probably less prolific than the media make out to be).

&gt; My point is that when one of the biggest contributors to the EU chooses to leave, they should be flexible if they too want a transition period. If the EU don't want a transition period, fine, we'll leave without a deal in 58 weeks and work from there.

As far as i understand we were the ones who tabled a transition period and the EU have just recently agreed between themselves the maximum length they would be willing to give. For them it is less of an issue because they still have all their other trade agreements in place and their markets would stabilise with the reduction in uncertainty. That's not to say that having a transition deal doesn't benefit them in some ways, but the power in negotiations tends to go to the person most willing and able to walk away. we might be willing, but we are far less able.

But if I've understood this correctly you would rather we just bolt and go straight to WTO rules in March next year? this seems absurd.... you would have to erect a border in Ireland, you would have all flights between EU and UK grounded and we would have zero trading agreements with the rest of the world (which can take anywhere between 3-10 years to negotiate with larger economies). i don't see how that's a good thing?",True,0,1517505114,,False,0,dtkvvaa,False,t3_7uhuc3,t1_dtktinf,/r/ukpolitics/comments/7uhuc3/statement_by_the_pm_that_we_have_got_to_take/dtkvvaa/,1518829031,8,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

The_George_Cz,,,"A lot of problems stem IMO from the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act which forbids the U.S. Government agency from keeping a registry directly linking non-National Firearms Act firearms to their owners.

I was having a hypothetical conversation with some other US gun guy on reddit, here is my theoretical proposal that could satisfy both parties. You could introduce firearm owner licence that needs clean record, medical check and law knowledge and safe handling test like here. The licence needs to be renewed every 5-10 years with just medical being submitted. Possesion and sales of firearms without that licence is now a felony. If you get charged with domestic, DUI or any felony and select misdemeanors (over here it's for example poaching) it leads to you losing your licence and your firearms. That cuts down on the numbers of felons, mentally ill, violent or otherwise unreliable people (like those who like to hit the bottle) in possesion of guns. In order to conduct a private sale, you need to notify your PD and get a permit from them (so that they can run backgroud checks on them), but otherwise, it should be shall issue. OR you could do it through an FFL. 

In turn, what you would gain is nationwide shall-issue CCW with that licence, NFA is repealed, so possesion of SBR, SBS and other fun stuff is now legal with no addition hassle (like it is over here in the Czech Republic), if you wanna take it further, you could also make it so that full-autos are legal to possess if you register them and submit to periodical check of storage. 

Now this is obviously me building castles in the sky, but I just find it fun to theorise about this stuff, as I believe our gun laws are one of the best out there, maybe save for the fact that we can't own suppressors or HP ammo (oh and the EU wants to reduce those rights, which pisses me off and I hope that we can tell them to sod off.

Endrju_Doda,,,"That's not true. The law strictly says ""against the facts"". Facts are defined. Undefined facts are just theories. Polish IPN rely only on facts documented from several sources/documents/witness and they must be in terms of crimes listed in Art 6. of International Military Tribunal signed by all Allies after the war.

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact

if Norman Davies is a historian then all his work is a scientific research and can be verified by documents/withesses or other sources then this law excludes him from any responsibility (Art. 55.p3)
If Norman Davies and his theories are against the facts and it can be proven and he's spreading it deliberately with knowledge that he's lying then then this law applies to him.

This law has one disadvantage because artists are also excluded and everything what this law should protect (including for purpose calling Nazi German Death Camps in occupied Poland as Polish Death Camps) may be called an artistic performance and therefore excluded from penalization. 

This law should be changed a little bit to include written permission for an artistic performance being excluded from this law.  There's no censorship at all in this law.  Truth will always defend itself.

There is similiar law in most of EU countries (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial). Polish law is mostly the same but also includes one major change to protect and prevent suggestions that nazi Geman Death Camps in occupied Poland was Polish Death Camps.  Poles and Polish Jews were slaughtered by Germans and that's the undeniable fact so please do not confuse the murderer with the victim.

The existence of collaborators in Poland can not be undermined because it is a documented historical fact. Another documented fact is that Polish Underground issued a death sentence for all collaborators and there's more than 100 confirmed executions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims#/media/File:WWII-HolocaustDeaths-Pie-All.svg

Please understand that 66% of poeple murdered in Holocaust (including people murdered by Soviets who invaded Poland several days after the Germans) was Polish Judes or ethnic Poles so saying that the camps were Polish is an untruth, a lie, a falsification of history and a violation of the memory of milions murdered people. And that's why this law is so important for Poles.

Title: **International Restraining Order [USA]**

Original Post: 

&gt; Some details are being left vague with respect to location, but here's some background:
&gt; 
&gt; * I am a US citizen living in the US with my wife
&gt; * My wife is a citizen of a Central American country and has just recently moved to the US
&gt; * My wife lived in Europe for a short period of time and met someone from a European country.
&gt; * This individual has been stalking her for nearly a decade
&gt;   - Several years ago, he showed up in her home country looking for her, harassed some of her family members a bit
&gt;   - I believe he came back a second time, but did not have funds to leave the airport and left after staying there a few days
&gt;   - She has not responded to any emails in several years, and basically told him to fuck off and has ignored him ever since
&gt;   - He sends near daily emails to her (several pages of all kinds of nonsense)
&gt;   - He tracks down and follows her online accounts when possible
&gt; * Two weeks ago he showed up in her country again looking for her and bothering her family and coworkers
&gt; 
&gt; We do not believe that he knows she is living in the US, but he does know she is married now and may suspect I am the husband (he has followed some of my accounts online as well) and it would be trivial to find out where I live.
&gt; 
&gt; **Question**: Is there anything we can do, legally, to preemptively prevent him from being able to enter the country or to ensure that he will be immediately deported if we comes to our residence (or any of my family members)? Can we get a restraining order under these circumstances without him ever having been in the country? 
&gt; 
&gt; Any other general advice would be appreciated as well.

I found it interesting that the city was divided by district numbers. He was go to District 5 but stay away from District 8 (don't remember the exact districts). It was so wild and felt like the Hunger Games to me (more like Hungarian Games amirite? sorry).


I also loved all those ""Ruin bars"". I remember one that had abandoned dentist chairs upstairs. It had a very ""Saw"" vibe. The energy and the people there was something special. Everyone was out and about at night especially near that Ferris wheel. A local Hungarian girl took us to get this huge fish along the river (hack?). 


Our hostel owner kept telling us to go to a restaurant named Fritzi Papa. Practically all the restaurants we went to were delicious and cheap. Oh and don't get me started on your city's huge bathhouse. 


I have so many fond memories of Budapest, especially staying out till the sun came up singing songs outside of the bar.

It would be great if someone did a real full analysis like you're talking about for both. But of course that would also depend on the fuel mix of your local power supply which varies.

boomstik101,,,"Oh boy, let me tell you about the time I went to a German rest stop. I was a junior in high school and on my first trip to Europe with a touring choir. We had just landed after a long flight and were on our way to Rothenburg that was our first concert location. We arrive at the nicest rest stop i have ever seen and stop for food. I ordered my food and got a 50 cent euro ticket to be used for the restroom. This is where the adventure begins.

I get through the line to get into the mens bathroom and a woman comes out of the stall. I panicked for a hot second and confirmed there were urinals in the room with me. I had never seen a woman in the men's room before and the thought was nigh unheard of to me. I went into the stall and did my business and the toilet didn't flush. There was a motion sensor on it, but it made the seat rotate and not the water. I tried the motion sensor a few more times in an attempt to make it flush instead of cleaning the seat. 

Desperate to not look the fool, i searched for some sort of button or lever on the walls. There was your standard fare of hooks, handrails and TP rolls, as well as a 1ft square metal placard at eye height that simply read ""STOP"". To my American sensibilities, this looked like a dispenser for toilet seat covers found in most rest stop bathrooms. Besides, I wanted the toilet to GO and not STOP. 

I stood there panicking, cleaning the toilet seat over and over until I decided to start pushing objects in the stall until it flushed. Nothing worked until I pushed the STOP slab and the physical relief I felt in that moment far outstripped my relief of doing what I entered the stall to do.

TL;DR

I couldn't find the button to make the toilet flush because it was a 1ft square metal panel labeled STOP when I wanted the toilet to GO.",True,0,1517507890,,False,0,dtkyvtu,False,t3_7ui180,t3_7ui180,/r/AskReddit/comments/7ui180/americans_who_visited_europe_what_was_your/dtkyvtu/,1518830521,2,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,

Emailed a week ago and I hadn't heard back, so I sent another email voicing my concerns of not being responded to. I got a response back 15 min later. I am really sorry, I thought I got back to you last week. Regarding your first question, the GMP certification process lead by Health Canada is following its course. Prior to the holidays, we had to contact the inspectorate to organize the audits. The audits were then initiated after January 7th because of the holidays. The CTA was resubmitted within the allowed time period and now we are awaiting the audit reports to comply to Health Canadas conditions for approval of the CTA. The process is going well. But I cannot certify how and when Health Canada is going to answer but we expect the approval and phase 3 to begin as planned in Q1 2018. Regarding the event, Tetras team was in San Francisco the week of JP Morgan, one of the busiest weeks for gathering of Investors and Commercial Partners in the BioPharma industry. We met more than 20 companies from Canada, the USA, Europe and Israel, with an equal mix of investors and potential partners. Other key meetings took place through various networking events throughout the week. One thing is clear: people now understand Tetras cannabinoid pharmaceutical business model, how it is different and how it is at the forefront of a revolution in the medical industry. A number of follow up meetings are being arranged, which will contribute to the momentum that has been building over the past six months I hope this answers your questions. So relax everybody like she said it's all going according to plan....just waiting on HC to get back with them. Just wanted to share this while everyone is freaking out. Shares are on sale....so get em while there cheap...peace.

as máquinas de aparar podem ser (linhas philips) ""multigroom"", ""bodygroom"" e ""beardtrimmer"".

* a bodygroom não serve para barbas, em geral tem 2 níveis de altura e tem a cabeça mais larga.
* a multigroom tem níveis de ajuste de altura, cabeça mais larga e lâmina mais resistente, mas, em geral, o suporte é menos robusto e ela é menos precisa para a barba (funciona, mas não é ideal).
* a beardtrimmer é uma máquina com mais ajustes de altura, a estrutura é mais fixa e tem a cabeça menor.

em geral, recomendo a beardtrimmer se vc precisa de muita precisão na barba e se não vai aparar pelos do corpo.

* The Senate is designed so each independent state has equal sway in making laws.

Is factually false. In fact in 1993 a group of independent states implemented something very similar...TWICE in their system. It is called the European Union.

**EU** Roughly how it works

* European Council (heads of states) get together decide what the EU cares about, similarly the national parliaments decide what is important. They throw all this shit at the EU commission with comes up with ideas to be implemented.

...Wait who the fuck is the commission: The commission is technically part of the executive branch, but is basically where laws actually ""start"" in the EU. It is made up of 1 representative per member state (appointed by that state) (insert crying about how a German vote is now worth 1/5 of a Belgian vote). The commission could be semi analogous to the Senate...although the commission is designed to be ""independent"" and focused on the EU as a whole rather than national policies.

* The Commission creates proposals and pushes them to the EU Parliament.

...Who the fuck is the EU Parliament? Parliament members (751 of them) are distributed to states by population (Germany has 96, Belgium has 21). These are elected officials and decided by popular vote in the country (Example if this was how US representatives were elected, Wisconsin would have 13 of the 751 seats, the GOP would have had 6 seats, the Dems would have 6 seats, and Libertarians would have had 1 seat, using the 2016 results (again just an example)).

* So the Parliament debates and either accepts or kicks it back to the commission to try again.

* If Parliament accepts it then it goes over to the council

...Who the fuck is the council? The council has one representative per member state (Germany has 1/5 the representation as Belgium by population rabble rabble rabble). The representative can change depending on the subject of legislation (so usually an expert in their given country for those policies).

* The Council either approves (yay the EU has a new law), or rejects it stating their issues, it gets kicked over to Parliament

* Parliament either approves (yay the EU has a new law), or rejects it and offers amendments and kicks it over to the commission.

* The commission gives their opinions on the amendments and kicks it over to the council.

* The Council agrees with amendments (yay the EU has a new law) or disagrees.

* A committee is formed to try and come to an agreement, they kick the agreement they come to to both the Council and Parliament

* If both accept (yay EU has a new law), if one rejects (yay EU doesn't have a new law).


So there are actually two levels of the EU system that individual states regardless of population have a tremendous amount of sway in the legislative process.


Coming back to the US. It is important to remember that the US is a collection of states that do run things fairly independently outside of issues that affect them all. The Senate is designed to give each state equal power. It does that effectively.

Which brings up the issue again of the House. The House is supposed to be the ""voice of the people"" in all of this, however there are major discrepancies in the voting population and representation.

So the question is why are you trying to argue at fixing something working as intended...when the other side of things is horrendously broken.

Why not fix the thing that is horrendously broken...


Sorry emotional arguments are fucking stupid and:

&gt; Why are people in Wyoming exponentially more valuable than people in CA or Texas?

Is an emotional argument.  In the exact same way that if ALL of our stuff was representative then:

&gt; Why are people in CA or Texas more valuable than people in Wyoming or New Hampshire?

JSlate_,,,"Hello. Ive been a Neocon for a few years now, hope these answers will suffice

1. I think America's enemies are Autocratic States such as Russia China Iran and North Korea. And Terrorist Groups, primarily ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.  

Their intentions are to establish multi-polar autocratic hegemony in their regions of influence. And Terrorists wish to establish Islamic Caliphates across the middle east.

Americas intention is to retain the Uni-polar world order that has existed since 1991. And remain the worlds sole superpower well into the next century. As for terrorists, Americas goal is to drive terrorism back to local levels to be dealt with by local security forces. Eventually, the need for US intervention will lessen as the groups become weak enough for the local authorities to deal with them. There will continue to be attacks, but they will be reserved to the local areas of the group, their body counts will be low, and they will be rolled-up by the local security forces.The War on Terror will transition to day-to-day law enforcement operations but before that can happen, the most violent, most well organized groups will have to be targeted, denied territory, and scattered.

2.I think you need to be more specific. Intervention differs from the word invasion. I support the Responsibility to Protect Doctrine. I think The United States has a duty to save people from starvation and ethnic cleansing. But since that's an ideological argument, ill put forth a realistic one based on current US interventions in the War on Terror.

Terrorists don’t go away because you ignore them. They aren’t bullies.But more importantly, they get more powerful when they have places to train and organize from. They get weaker when those “ungoverned spaces” are denied to them.

We do know what happens when the US did not treat terrorism as an act of war and resource that fight appropriately. You see, 9/11 was not the first attack by Al Qaeda on the United States. Most notably, two US embassies in Africa had been bombed in 1998 and then in 2000, the USS Cole was bombed in port in Yemen. In the first case, the US launched a few cruise missiles at AQ camps in Afghanistan (and a factory in the Sudan) but chose not to follow up. In the second case, it was treated straight forwardly as a criminal investigation. (There is some argument that AQ also attacked us in 1994 when the WTC was first bombed and in 1996 when the US military barracks in Dahran, Saudi Arabia was bombed but I don’t believe either of those were conclusively shown to be AQ.)

 
 So what was the result of not overreacting or spending excessively on the war on terror? AQ struck again. This time, they killed 3,000 people when they attacked the WTC on 9/11. As discussed above, we know there were plans to replicate that attack on the West Coast but with far more aircraft. AQ was demonstrating an *increasing* capability. At Tarnak Farms they were experimenting with Ricin and Sarin. (They were not getting very far but they were working on it…how much time should we have allowed them?)

Aside from 3,000 lives, 9/11 resulted in $40 BILLION in insurance losses . The stock market plummeted. The airline industry was crippled and required a bailout to the tune of $15 BILLION. The tourism industry suffered a 40% loss as well. 


 That was from one attack. Had the attacks continued as planned, the economic devastation would have been horrific.

Because they had a safe haven in Afghanistan, they were able to continue to train their recruits. They were able to develop their techniques and technologies because there was nobody there to stop them. They didn’t have to hide from drones and they weren’t being rolled up in the middle of the night.
 
 There is absolutely NO reason to suspect that 9/11 was going to be the last attack. And there is considerable evidence to believe that if AQ had been allowed to continue to operate freely in Afghanistan, they would have launched more and more impressive attacks.

Point two is, the expenditure and the War on Terror appears to have worked. After 9/11, AQ was disorganized. They lost their training camps. They lost their ability to gather in a single place and plan and plot and fund future attacks. They were never able to train their recruits to the same level as they had been trained prior to 9/11. Instead, they focused on huddling in small rooms and *talking* about how to fire a weapon or how to build a bomb without actually getting to test these skills out because that would mean attracting the attention of a drone or special operations raid.

 And how did that work out for them? Well, it turns out that when you can’t train. When you can’t smuggle in the best recruits to meet and develop plans, you end up with a lot of half-assed attacks that are more of an embarrassment than a true threat. The guys who attacked the London metro on 7/7 and the ones who perpetrated the Madrid train bombings had all be recruited and trained prior to 9/11.
 
 Since AQ could no longer bring their recruits to Afghanistan to train? Not one significant terrorist attack from AQ.

ISIL still has room to train. They have freedom of maneuver in parts of Iraq and Syria. But that room is shrinking. And while they have it they are still a significant threat as our friends in Paris and Brussels have unfortunately learned. So we have to continue to shrink that maneuver room so that ISIL can’t develop the same level of planning and training that AQ was able to benefit from in the 1990s.

So no, 30 Americans killed per year is not the justification for the War on Terror. The 2,970 Americans not killed per year is the justification. The $3.3 Trillion dollars which is not lost due to terrorist attacks is the justification.

There are costs. And then there investments.

3.The Practical International Situation is a world where terrorism is a thing of the past in size and scale. And an American dominated world where enemies are contained and most countries are transitioning to Liberal Democracies. Basically America from 2002-2008. Ideally every country would be a Liberal Democracy, but were a long time away from that world. The Major concerns is the Euro-American drift and isolationist and nativist tendencies across America and Europe. American abdication would have horrific effects on the world, just as weve seen in the 20s and 30s, the last time America refused its leadership role.

From the mindset of that culture, if 'you are raping your own spouse' you're a morally upstanding member of the community with a disobedient spouse.

I hate that outlook too, but pretending its something else entirely, and that semitic culture is anti-rape or pro-fidelity (on a basis of equality and consent anyways), is as dangerous as it is wrong.

Those same prohibitions against adultery were routinely cast aside through the dehumanization of oppressed peoples who were subjected to war, murder, rape, mutilation, occupation, and enslavement at the hands of semitic tribes.

The majority of Google's market is USA+EU. 

&gt;its crazy to me how much everyone gives these companies the benefit of the doubt.

It's crazy to me how people think these companies are plotting *something* with our data. They are not. Google's whole service ecosystem relies on data collection. Everything from search results, to your YouTube feed, to even map location searches relies on collecting your data and shredding it through machine learning algorithms to sort you out and provide you with relevant results to what you are actually looking for. 

Search results use your data to, for example, know if your ""kill child"" query is you being curious of murdered human children and having broken english, or you being curious about killing child processes. That query on ""virgin"" browser gives you 2-3 links related to child processes and the rest is just infanticide news, while my browser with my account logged in gives me a solid ~5 pages worth of child process related links before spouting the first infanticide-related link. This is prevalent in many of their services.

YouTube without data collection means you'd pretty much only get videos of people you subscribe to, while the rest of your feed is either popular videos or new videos. In fact, not even ""popular"" videos would work. Popular where? The USA popular videos are very different from my country's popular videos (Spain), for example. If you don't want data collection that also means no location data from you, so what, YouTube just serves up ""world popular"" videos?

GMail without data collection means useless spam filters.

Maps without data collection is similiar to search results without data collection. Typing ""Barcelona"" while being 5km away from Barcelona, Spain, would yield navigation results to a list of Barcelona cities, starting with Barcelona in Argentina, since you don't want google using your location data either.

GMail + maps + searches without data collection means no more convenient ""your flight AAA111 leaves in XX minutes and there is heavy traffic on your way to the airport, leave in YY minutes to arrive in time!"" notifications in your phone. 

Google makes so much money off advertising ***precisely** because it can target ads with extreme accuracy, ""wasting"" as little views as possible from advertisers.

Sometime, hopefully soon, the world (see below) will realize the hypocrisy and call for an end of genital cutting for both genders.

My personal answer (and yes personal , I don't have all the answers in the world, that doesn't mean my argument falls apart lol) is that circumcision is normalized in the US. And it's been normalized to the point there seems to be this idea that there needs to be an argument and proof against circumcision. That's why I posted the definition of FGM, to show this is completely backwards. But it is not normalized in all of the west and you can see many medical organizations that say it should not be done (see below). You even see proposals at laws to ban it, *you know the original article of the thread*. 

I believe in time everything you ask will be sorted out. Things change over time you know. There was probably a time when it wasn't called FGM, and a time when no one spoke out against it. There was even a time when western physicians supported FGM (really, look up Kellogg and how he recommended pouring acid on girl's clits). Things change, don't take the current status quo to mean that the status quo is justified.

And note that both the AAP and CDC have been criticized that [“Conceptually, the CDC relies on an inappropriate construal of risk in its benefit vs. risk analysis, since it appears to interpret “risk” as referring (primarily or exclusively) to the “risk of surgical complications.” and “...underestimated even the known risks of circumcision, by focusing on the comparatively rare, immediate surgical risks and complications that occur soon after the operation, while ignoring or downplaying the comparatively common intermediate and long-term complications”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364150/)

The Canadian Paediatric Society [“does not recommend the routine circumcision of every newborn male.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) I recommend reading this one since they have all the data clearly laid out, something you don’t often see.

The British Medical Association [“considers that the evidence concerning health benefits from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.”](http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/3/259.full)

The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (representing Australia and New Zealand) says [“the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand.”](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-of-infant-males.pdf)

The German Pediatrics Society position says [“in the interest of the best interests of the child, they should choose not to circumcise, even if it is for reasons of religion or tradition. Medical benefits of circumcisions are not sufficiently scientifically proven. ”](https://www.dakj.de/stellungnahmen/beschneidung-von-minderjaehrigen-jungen/)(translated by google)

The Joint statement from the Nordic Ombudsmen for Children and pediatric experts (representing Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland) says [“Circumcision, performed without a medical indication, on a person who is incapable of giving consent, violates fundamental medical-ethical principles, not least because the procedure is irreversible, painful and may cause serious complications. There are no health-related reasons for circumcising young boys in the Nordic countries. Circumstances that may make circumcision advantageous for adult men are of little relevance to young boys in the Nordic countries, and on these matters the boys will have the opportunity to decide for themselves when they reach the age and maturity required to give consent.”](https://www.crin.org/en/docs/English-statement-.pdf) 

The Royal Dutch Medical Association says [“There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in the light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds.”](https://www.knmg.nl/advies-richtlijnen/knmg-publicaties/publications-in-english.htm)

These were just some countries, we still have other developed countries against circumcision.

Well, looking at the list of scheduled friendlies for European and South American countries in the article, pretty much all of them are against World Cup teams.

&gt; The other FAs don’t give a shit about whether US is underachieving or any of the debates we’re having post-Trinidad...to them all we are is an available national team with a squad of competent pro players, many of whom with experience at decent levels in Europe.

Why wouldn't it matter, specially since the USMNT seems to be using something less than their best squad in friendlies these months (not that it's the wrong call, but still)? Having a good game against the USMNT right now tells top countries very little about their readiness for the World Cup, so it's not that useful.

hopeLB,str,*,"""Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and  Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council. While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council’s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest.

According to journalist Robert Parry “The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe “This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.”

Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.”

So, to make sense of all this, most of the people listed would have held cabinet positions in a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the Interpreter is a project of RFE/RL then the decision to go ahead with Propornot would have to go across their desk. That includes then Sec of State, John Kerry.

The unasked question of why would a US Government Agency do this (?) needs to be addressed. All the people listed above were actively working for Clinton to get her elected and throw Donald Trump’s campaign off the rails.

After the election, they were going to take care of Clinton’s “deplorables” by dissecting alternative media. I wrote about this before the election and I warned several major new sites what they could expect. I was right on the money. After she lost, it was already in motion. The deplorable media didn’t fall into a particular political pattern other than they did not promote Hillary Clinton.

The purpose of Propornot has been to get people to demand freedom of speech be rolled back. This was/is to be done by destroying fact-based media.

I mean seriously. How do you infiltrate 3,000 miles into the capital, but die when an android strangles you. Unbelievable.

The next one was quite interesting, another boy. Frank Catrin from America. He was a true leader, doe eyed and always smiling. I knew he had potential the first day he destroyed one of my nuclear silos. The footage was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. He knew the facility inside and out, he knew the guard rotations, he knew the security system, the boy was a phenomenal planner. But in his genius was arrogance. Monumental arrogance, perhaps almost as great as mine. If I could have spoken to him before the bullet blew away his head, I would tell him, “Frank, you’re a genius, but to be as arrogant as you are, you have to be my level of genius.”

My world has lost its beauty. No one dares to raise a hand. They do not look me in the eye. They stare at my feet like insects to a light. There is no thrill. No danger of death. No rebellions, no revolution, no LIFE. 

That is why, my dear Alexander, I am building *you.* You will be the ultimate enemy for me. You will be beautiful and strong, you will crush any of your foes that are not me. You will stand unchallenged until you reach me. You will be the second greatest man in the world.

In goes the brains. Kassidy. Bosnia boy. Frank. Then the past legends. Caesar. Napoleon. Hannibal. Rommel. Genghis. Saladin. 

My dear Alexander. You will live a life of poverty, but you will not die. You will claw your way out of the sewers, you will kick down everyone clinging onto you, and when you are finally ready. You will not show mercy, you will not try to sway me, you will completely and utterly destroy me.

Or not.


But you can try.

GunsTheGlorious,,,"Jesus, did you read anything I wrote?

Nobody wants a stagnant, stable planet, you fuckwit. 

We *do not have the capacity* to move 2 billion people. We *do not have the capacity* to continue feeding every human if desertification continues at this rate. You get this, right? We are looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe that will kill millions, or hundreds of millions. 

*Control-freak?* Are you *fucking* kidding me? *Inferior people from inferior countries?* This is a fucking global crisis. Your inability to fucking read notwithstanding, you seem to also have no idea what the *fuck* you're talking about, either.

&gt; Humans are part of the natural order

Yeah, that's the fucking problem, dickbrain. We're inside the natural order and we're fucking it up real good. We're gonna pull a Samson act and bring the fucking thing down on our heads.

Let me reiterate this; no environmental change on this scale has *ever* occurred in a couple of hundred years. Toba, which is the largest volcanic eruption we know of, which almost wiped out the human race, had less of an impact on the climate than the Industrial Revolution. 

Jesus Christ, it's fucking idiots like you that are why we're dealing with this issue right now. No one's asking your illiterate ass to give up modern conveniences. No one's asking you to go back to a farm and eke out a living in medieval conditions. The LHC and the ISS and the Apollo Program are a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of a percent of a very small part of the problem. But someone's convinced you that everyone who actually knows anything is just panicking and telling people this shit because they want to feel important, as opposed to the fact that *this is fucking important*.

&gt; I will either adapt and survive, as humans have always done no matter how harsh things got, or I will not

This is the point right here. *This is* the adaptation. We will either restrain our climate footprint or we will undergo the deaths, displacements, and impoverishments of billions. You think I'm talking about fucking North Africa or India? I'm talking about Western Europe. I'm talking about the East Coast of the US. Where I live? In the US of fucking A? It's gonna be underwater in 30 years at this rate. You remember the recession? We're gonna be remembering that as the good old days.

Y'know what, though, I know I didn't get through to you. You're so convinced that the reason that every single person who has studied this issue- including people who work for the fucking gas companies- are shitting themselves right now is because they're virtue signalling so they'll get laid. You're completely convinced that they want you to crush your car and only eat organic. If you're over 50 and male, statistically, you probably won't even live to see the worst happen. If not, then this is your problem too. 

I'm not gonna bother linking any actual studies here, cause this is reddit and you're not gonna read a 300 page study by some Harvard professor. I'm gonna link [this](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html) instead, and you're gonna ignore it even if you do read it. 

The only bright side here is that you are finally in the minority of people. Because, thank god, [last year the overwhelming majority of Americans understood the issue](http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx). So, who knows; maybe some shit will actually get done.

Brexit is undoubtedly negative, joining the EU was the only good economic decision made since WW2...but we aren't ""fucked"", over the span of a few decades Brexit is not likely to be particularly relevant. GDP might be lower but this could quite easily be offset by sensible policy making.

Second, leading on from that point, the problem is that British politicians are incapable of making sound economic decisions. Brexit reflects that: politicians are driven by, as you say, ""small-minded"" thinking from voters.

I think it is helpful, if you believe in independence, to separate those points. The latter argument is much more powerful because it actually explains why Brexit is bad. Just going, ""Oh, everything is fucked, let's roll the dice"" isn't an argument for anything. The economic effect of Brexit is unknown, the economic effect of the things that caused Brexit are very well known.

You call it ""small-minded"" thinking, whatever you call it, the result was economic stagnation until the UK joined the EU. For Scotland, the result of this complacency was the 1980s.

This is funny because [Hitler was actually on very good terms with the Mufti of Jerusalem and the whole Arab world](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-mufti-and-the-f-uuml-hrer), and later declared the Germans would help free them from British/French/Jewish imperialism.

Not wanting Muslims to over-run and genocide our own people doesn't mean we hate them, in fact [Nazi Germany had very positive supportive relations with the Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Arab_world).

&gt;""Erwin Rommel was almost as popular as Hitler. ""Heil Rommel"" was reportedly a common greeting in Arab countries. Some believed the Germans would free them from the rule of the old colonial powers France and Britain. After France's defeat by Nazi Germany in 1940, some Arabs were chanting against the French and British around the streets of Damascus: ""No more Monsieur, no more Mister, Allah's in Heaven and Hitler's on earth.""

No. I want self-determination and not to be genocided by mass refugee migrant waves.

I wasnt in low prio or comm banned. I didn't play any games and im already 6 month banned.

Guess it was retrospective or something like that.

Banned till August 1st.

I just recently started playing again after over 1 year and all my ges were 5 cores, russians screaming in mic and intentional feeding with courier and themselves. Last game i got ""reported"" by a Russian cm (one of the few games we had a ""support"" (didnt do any supporting) for buying ogre staff on legion commander because they thought i was building bkb when i was really building aghs.  I domt even know why the cm thought a bkb was a bad item on legion either. 

Can't say im going to be missing this much until august but kind of sad at the state of the game. Tbh my favorite times playing dota is when it was invite only. Everyone was so friendly and nice. 

Also, yes i was toxic at times, yes i also got fake reports for being a carry pick when we lose. Im not saying im completely innocent but that the system is poor. It offers no incentives to reform or be nice to others and promotes a culture of blaming and raging and toxic behavior. 

You cant even communicate with your team 75% of the time on eu servers. Anyone can pick a language on server select so i dont think the improved mm will do anything. 

I dont get why valve doesn't make a system like csgo overwatch for dota. Would solve so much and make the system not abuseable

redlightsaber,,Psychiatry,"&gt; How do we reconcile the liberal narrative that Trump's only base is uneducated trailer-dwellers, with the reality that many highly accomplished doctors remain on his side?

The obvious answer is that you don't need to make the case that Trump's only base are uneducated trailer-dwellers. This is actually quite a dangerous narrative, I think. Mainly because it doesn't reflect reality. And we need to understand reality in order to fix whatever is going on in the US. 

I tend to think a simpler answer is the same reason relatively wealthier people have always tended to be republicans, and  you just got a huge honking clue: the tax bill. The rest are secondary rationalisations. Wealthy people don't want to pay more taxes, so they support the party that will provide that for them. 

Physicians are no different from most people in terms of selfishness or missing the big picture of what the consequences of this are. I know we all like to think we're that much better, but we're really not. Even those among us strictly anchored on left political ideologies can have our days of spurious individualism. 

I don't know what the answer is for the US. It genuinely scares me, even though for now it seems the looming spread of racist nationalistic ideologies among widespread national politics has been halted in Europe. **For now**.

&gt; Rivo was born in The Hague, The Netherlands, May 1983. He grew up there and spent a lot of time busy on sports. As his musical interests were growing, he listened to house music during the mid 90s. After a while he decides to get seriously involved in making music and his success starts growing. His sound combines classic dub-techno elements with current trends. This way he gives a creative output which is much valued nowadays.

&gt; At an the initial stage he spread his music through the internet. Involved listeners, from e.g. Berlin, discovered Rivo’s work. He quickly received good responses and other people, particularly from east and south Europe, followed.

&gt; In the meanwhile he bought records and began to spin on some cheep gear. Right now, while dj-ing he always showcases a techno-oriented set organised with classics and fresh work. Each set is legendary Basic Channel inspired varying with current underground dub- and deep-techno records. This unique combination unite to a successful and creative own sound.

thatguyonthewebs_v2,,,"God, I love the cesspool that is twitter and our president's twitter. Fucking lol. Alright, he's trying to take credit.

Yes, it was. Does anyone ever ask, ""Why? Why did such a high corporate tax rate work then? Why did it steadily fall?"" Maybe because American companies had literally nowhere else to go. Europe? War torn, still rebuilding, half is off limits because of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. Okay, let's go to Asia... Japan is a glowing green island... China is recovering from devastation and massacres that make the holocaust look better. India? They just kicked out the British and have a very strong anti-west sentiment. Well, what about the other largely unaffected countries? Either lawless shitholes and/or trade taxes would make it too risky and/or non-profitable. Shit, looks like we're stuck until the world recovers and can compete again.

Yes it was! Bush lowered taxes to compete with free trade countries that NAFTA gave access to. The withdrawal of the auto industry started before Bush! So many industries moved to Mexico, it's insane! Why pay higher taxes and adhere to so many regulations and labor laws in America where Mexico doesn't have these extra regulations? Their gov't is too busy dealing with the cartel anyway! A few just skipped over the Detroit river to Canada. The Big 3 only had assembly plants here for over a decade now. All the parts were made abroad (because being in a lawless cartel-controlled shithole, car companies only produced parts so the cartel and other crime syndicates wouldn't have interest in stealing parts)

So no, cutting taxes give greedy businessmen more opportunity to make bigger money piles and put their businesses here. Competitive trade taxes means that companies will think twice about moving abroad to a cheaper, less regulated workforce when taxes would make the move higher risk with less reward. Look at all the sweat shops in all the Asian countries already. Apple, every clothing producer, etc. Pay these people poorly, little to no regulation on how it's produced and meet American standards of product quality.

I don't think third world and economically shitty first world countries should have free trade agreements with the USA. UK, France, Germany, Japan, other top countries? Yes. But shitty countries shouldn't be exploited by businesses and put American workers out of work.

Lastly, the bailouts were the one of the worst decisions any president had made.

If you remove blacks and hispanics from US statistics you need to compare it to countries with their own racial and ethnic groups that lag behind the curve.

That's how the parliament sees it.  I believe there's also a few council members who've been very insistent on these rights, and they would probably object to anything other than the deal they currently have.

Essentially, the EU parliament/council/commission have absolutely no interest in negotiating - they already have an 'acceptable' deal on the table for citizen's rights when the UK leaves the EU.

Rag_in_a_Bottle,,,"Okay what the fuck are you even saying anymore? You claimed that saying a racial slur would get you banned, yet you're still here racking in those upvotes. That was my ""point"". I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say in your first statement.

&gt; No, it's not fine if a culture or race becomes a minority in its homeland.

Are you enraged at the fact that mainland Europe is no longer Celtic? Do you think we should reinstate Celtic culture across Germany, France, and Iberia? Probably not, so I have to ask why? In this case, the Celts were removed largely by violence and war, not simply intermarrying and and breeding with Romans. Are you up in arms at the literal genocide of Native Americans? Should all non natives living in the Americas be removed? Again, probably not, so why? (On the off chance that you do agree with those statements please correct me).

&gt; What if millions of X rush in Israel and replace the native population?

...okay? So what? I don't care as long as they don't start killing people or putting them in camps.

&gt; What if Y rush into Native American lands and replace the native population?

That's what's called colonization. It's a thing that already happened and was a lot more violent and barbaric than anything going on in Europe right now. On that point, South/Central American communities were a lot more likely to intermarry and breed with the native populations. The end result was a new and unique culture. Shouldn't you like that?

&gt; It's not racist to not want that, it's racist to want that.

I don't know how many times I have to say it: no one is actively pushing for the elimination of European whites. Get that victim complex out of your head, because it's not true. I don't know if you simply don't understand that or are deliberately misleading yourself.

And no, it's not racist to want to preserve culture for culture's sake. On the subject of Celts, Irish people wanting to keep their language alive is not racist at all. What's racist is the belief that the natural and peaceful integration and evolution of culture is a bad thing that should be opposed.

And again, your last paragraph is gibberish. What's your obsession with the word ""nigger"" and trigger warnings? I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

As a final point, you don't seem to understand what culture is. It's not a static feature of a society. It changes all the time according to technology, the environment, and other groups of people.

---

**Things they got right and how:**

- Larger highway signs - By making them larger and easier to read while driving
- Computerized safe driving predictors - By emergency auto-breaking cars
- Computerized traffic updates - By GPS
- Computerized speed suggestions - Electronic city speed signs that change during rush hour/ hightraffic, and GPS
- Rearview television screens - Exactly that 
- Prefabricated bridges - Many smaller bridges can be(and are) built with prefab parts
- Self building bridges - Apparently China has these. Fuck me i was gonna label it as wrong.
- cantilevered skyways - Extremely rare, but exist
- decentralized cities with longer commutes - Absolutely 100% correct
- Highspeed highways all over the continent - Since the time this video was made, highways have exploded all over the world connecting everyone.
- Self driving cars - Exactly that
- Synchronized scanning map - GPS. Using satellites to scan instead of the car. 
- Video Conferences - Skype, Facetime, countless examples.
- Car elevators - Not like they showed, but are absolutely real and used by wealthy condo owners. 
- parking cylinders - Not horizontally like the video, but rather vertically above and underground.
- Moving sidewalks - Mostly used in airports
- Escalators - Magically moving staircases!
- Water capable cars - They exist, but are expensive to maintain, impractical, and slightly dangerous. 
- Highways will link together nations - Europe

---

**Things they almost got right and why/why not:**

- Radar for poor visibility - Self driving cars have a form of radar, but no visual radar screen exists in commercial vehicles
- Air born emergency services - Helicopters are used by paramedics to quickly bring people to hospital, by police to follow pursuit in chases, and by firefighters to drop water on forest fires, but they aren't combined into 1 service vehicle and aren't used to tow cars
- Giant road builders - We have machines that can lay brick roads, and machines that can pave roads, but most require the help of other machines and people, and cannot build brand new roads over unworked land by themselves.
- Preset destination cards for pleasure vehicles - Cruise ships and party buses come close to this, but neither are used to get from point A to point B, 
- Gas turbine cars - they have been built, but incredibly impractical and dangerous
- Jet Cars - these have also been built, and have the same problem
- Electric suspension car - Electric sun powered cars exist, but the hover suspension does not.
- Tubular highways - Elon musk is currently designing something very similar to this idea, but with trains
- Suspended bridges over oceans - Canada's Confederation Bridge goes over the Northumberland straight for a whopping 12.9-kilometer distance. Not an ocean, but incredibly long. 

---

**Things they got wrong and why:**

- Colour coded highways - The cost in paint and upkeep would be enormous
- Iradiated roads - Because cancer
- fog dispelling machines - cost? How exactly would that even work
- Atomic reactor tunneling machine - Incredibly dangerous idea
- Cars that separate - Because you don't want to seperate your family into oncoming traffic. Dangerous, impractical, and ridiculous. 
- Advances in technology will give more time for leisure - Because the rich have horded all the wealth while prices continually increase. Why continue to pay people decent wages when robots can do everything, and the unemployed will happily work more for less? Creating competition in the job market which only benefits the employers who then use tax havens to ensure that they pay the very least they can back into the system. 
- Highway escalators - impractical and costly when the alternative is to simply build around or through the mountain for cheaper, faster, and less maintenance.
-  Trains that separate on the go - Long theorized but not yet realized
- Trains cars that go directly to market - would have to lay tracks everywhere and the amount of coordination/traffic control would be ridiculously impossible to properly manage. Transport trucks do this job instead
- Trains that drive onto boats and stack up - Possible, but impractical. I'm sure it's probably been done somewhere with poor results.
- Trains that drive onto boat
- Trains that drive into rockets that fly - Bitch are you high? That is the most dangerous thing so far suggested. 
- Nuclear cars - The Next level of dangerous suggestions. Who doesn't enjoy fallout with their car crashes?
- Air-conditioned indoor highways - Why heat or cool the whole highway when you can simply control your car temp.
- Private garages that clean and fuel your vehicle - while entirely possible, these ideas are impractical and dangerous.

Jagoff86,,,"Oh really, so they have a choice in Saudi Arabia? A lot of Muslim countries are bastions of progressive ideas huh? Islam is very clear on this stuff, so if you studied it more you'd know. Go listen to some of Ayan Hirsi Ali's speeches. 

 Some of the more moderate Muslim countries may give women an option, but most do not. Most need a male companion to leave the house, their testimony under Sharia is worth half of a man's, genital mutilation, etc. I wonder why hundreds of European women have been sexually assaulted, told to cover up, harassed, and/or raped by Muslim refugees simply for dressing in normal western clothing???

If you want some examples just look at articles and YouTube videos of Muslim attacks on women in Europe such as Cologne Germany for example. Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe btw.

hachihoshino,,Working in Japan,"&gt; I still feel like this sub shouldn't have to scare away and be assholes to anybody that comes by here

But this is the thing, you keep saying that... and yet I'm not seeing examples of it. Look down the front page of the sub - it's basically full of people asking questions and getting answers. The only thread where I'd say someone is getting a bit of a harsh time from posters is the guy who wants to move to Japan to... er... *stalk people and report them to immigration*, and if that doesn't deserve a harsh time I don't know what the hell does.

In terms of ""growing the sub"" - I really don't think that having a ton more questions posted here is going to attract more people to answer them. The simple fact is that Reddit isn't hugely popular in Japan (either Japanese or immigrants) and therefore most people who could answer questions on these topics don't use this site. Also, growing the sub isn't really our goal - the reality is that there aren't all that many people out there who have legit questions about moving to Japan that can't be answered more quickly and easily on Google. There's a simple reason for that; moving to Japan is *really easy*. It's a wealthy developed country with an *incredibly* straightforward and welcoming immigration policy - coming here is much, much easier than immigrating to Europe or the United States, or to pretty much any other developed country. There aren't really any gotchas or tricky aspects to the standard immigration procedure, and as such you'd expect the number of questions to be asked in a sub like this to be pretty low - because for most people, they just follow the standard advice (on official immigration websites etc.) and have no problems. 

There's zero value in a subreddit that's just full of people asking questions that are fully answered in the first hit on Google, and I don't entirely understand why a handful of people are so adamant that we're being mean and horrible by discouraging that behaviour. ""What research have you done by yourself to solve this problem?"" is the first question I ask students any time they come to me with an issue in their studies or research, and they're paying thousands of dollars a year to be at university - is it so unreasonable to ask the same of people trying to get advice from redditors for free?",True,0,1517535199,,False,0,dtlqrpl,True,t3_7scjew,t1_dtlpia3,/r/movingtojapan/comments/7scjew/psa_meta_posts_about_this_sub_complaints_or/dtlqrpl/,1518844091,1,False,movingtojapan,t5_3fy6c,public,

bananarepubliccat,,,"A few things...the next recession will occur with or without Brexit, it would have occurred if we had stayed in the EU. Recessions don't have catalysts either. It appears that way in retrospect but the catalyst for all recessions, broadly speaking, is an upturn as capitalism is inherently cyclical. Automation is neither here nor there (the relative change in productivity that automation will bring is nothing compared to the ones we have already experienced). 

You are totally correct, globalisation of supply chains is very important . But it is also true that those trends are happening everywhere. Being in the EU makes that easier but China isn't in the EU and a lot of ""intermediate production"" happens there...as an example. Also, the reason why the trend is so important is that it forced inefficient producers out of business. Improving competitiveness was always something that Britain could have done outside the EU, it is something that other countries have done no problem (but my point was that this never would have happened because our politicians are spineless).

The Scottish govt is not prepared, not even close. They are amazingly short of policy making expertise, the SNP is somewhat dominant but can't communicate effectively outside their base, most of our politicians are just nowhere the calibre needed for independence as their world is just their constituency and blaming the Tories. Ez life. The real world is totally different as there is no-one to blame and you are faced with decisions that will often hurt some people badly.

&gt; Sabaton is a symphonic power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts. In April 2012, four members left the band and formed another, whilst vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members.

&gt; Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.

&gt; In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.

&gt; The band returned for a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.

&gt; Their third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like ""Back in Control"" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), ""Attero Dominatus"" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and ""Angels Calling"" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.

&gt; In March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song ""Birds of War"".

&gt; As a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles ""Cliffs of Gallipoli"" and ""Ghost Division"".

&gt; In September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.

&gt; The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War ""White Death"". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.

&gt; On March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found, Sabaton used digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.

&gt; Following the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage, ""Carolus Rex,"" the first single for the album of the same name (Carolus Rex), was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world tour headlined as ""The Swedish Empire Tour"". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.

&gt; ""Carolus Rex"" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album was made available in both Swedish and English versions.

&gt; Regarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented: ""It appears to be sudden, but it had actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...""

&gt; The former members of Sabaton have since formed a new band called ""Civil War"", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.

&gt; In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. With Snowy Shaw replacing him as touring drummer.

&gt; In November 2013, it was announced that Sabaton would be touring North America with Iced Earth for six weeks in the spring of 2014. Robban Bäck has also left the band and been replaced with Hannes van Dahl of Evergrey.

&gt; In January 2014, the band announced the cover of their new album called ""Heroes,"" due to be released on May 16 2014. The album proved to be a hit and made #1 on the official Swedish album chart. On 27 January the band was announced to play Download Festival in June.

&gt; Thobbe Englund left Sabaton as guitarist with release of their new album ""The Last Stand"" on 19th August 2016 to ""expand his own creativeness in combination with a somewhat stiller life, where he will not tour all year round at the speed of light"" as he said himself.

GunsTheGlorious,,,"The problem with that is that it ignores the way the fundamental logic behind the concept of money.

You are attaching a significance to a piece of paper (or, more likely these days, a number on a screen). This piece of paper has no intrinsic value to you or, say, the barista at your favorite coffee shop. 

So *why* are you attaching that significance? Because everyone else does, right? Money only has significance as long as both sides of the transaction give it significance; try spending Indians rupees in a French cafe, and you're gonna get thrown out and told to come back with some euros. 

The *reason* you attach this significance- the reason everyone in your country attaches this significance- is because the government of your country said it was so. This is why, for example, in 1995, when the countries of the EU decided to accept the euro, people accepted the new currency; because the government said ""now this paper is valuable, and the old one isn't"", and people believed them. 

The only reason they have to believe them is faith that now, to everyone in their country (and several others), this type of paper was valuable.

&gt; Millionaire is a Belgian rock band formed in 1999 by former Evil Superstars, dEUS and Eagles of Death Metal guitarist, Tim Vanhamel.

&gt; They have released three albums:
Outside The Simian Flock (2001)
Paradisiac (2005)
Sciencing (2017)

&gt; Paradisiac was produced by Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age) and fine-tuned at fellow QOTSA member Alain Johannes' studio. The album saw the band creating a harder-edged sound with obvious influences from the Queens.

&gt; Josh noticed Millionaire opening for the Masters of Reality in the SMAK (Ghent) and was so impressed he asked them to support his band on their European and American tours. Millionaire have since toured with Muse and Foo Fighters and in the U.S. with the Taste Of Chaos 2006 festival.

&gt; The band released two tracks for the Ex-Drummer soundtrack, Mongoloid (Devo cover) and Deep Fish. In this movie, they are played by the fictional band ""The Feminists"". Tim has recently released his own solo album. On December 5th, 2008, the band announced they are working on a new album. Read more on Last.fm.

windsyofwesleychapel,,,"Each state had its own method for determining whether or not the Constitution would be ratified.  Not all states had public process, but all states did have a process where the citizenry (as defined in each state) voted for members of the state legislatures which did make the decision.  It was rather indirect in some cases, but the issues were strongly debated in the public sphere and politicians were pressured to side with the prevailing feelings of the population. 

The territories not in the original 13 colonies ceded to the US in 1783 had no choice but were sparsely populated with those of European decent.  True, native americans were not given a choice, but they were never given a choice anywhere ever, by anyone including France, Britain, Spain etc.  Each new territory would be organized and when the population was sufficiently large (60K) they would form a state legislature, write a constitution, and then ask for full admittance into the Union.  No, they weren't given the option of forming their own countries, but as these territories were filled with American settlers, that was never part of the plan.  Puerto Rico, won from Spain in 1898 has decided NOT to become a state though all Puerto Ricans are US citizens from birth.  It has had the option to become its own country if if the population wishes, but as of yet they have chosen to remain a territory of the US (as all modern states of the US minus the original 13 were prior to gaining statehood).

They're a European raccoon-dog (as in the European cousins of tanuki and not a hybrid between raccoons and dogs). With a mostly ashy to brown coat with vermilion and or autumn red accents mostly on the underbelly in the shape of a cross (though there could be other markings as well, like having the fur at the bottom of the legs and by the paws being one of the accent colors or something). This underbelly is also scarred by a brand of a small to perhaps medium sized Phoenix rising from ashes (obviously not in any particular degree of detail given the fact that its a brand as opposed to a tattoo). They also have small and old miscellaneous scars from small incidents throughout their time. 

Though they are stubborn to the core and not particularly revealing, time spent with them would tell you that they are a good person and a loyal friend willing to do more for others than even himself. Frankly, many of the scars would likely tell tales of them helping friends though out time long past. Meeting them today would tell you that they are a loner mentally battered and beaten by an inability to form a relationship that felt mutualistic instead of being him giving all of himself to someone not willing to do the same.

As I said before, it's not fully flushed out but it's a thought I've had for quite awhile and I would love to see an interpretation as done by an artist certainly better than myself.

RichSaila,,,"Here's what Tolkien had to say about that:  
&gt;May I say that all this is 'mythical', and not any kind of new religion or vision. As far as I know it is merely an imaginative invention, to express, in the only way I can, some of my (dim) apprehensions of the world. All I can say is that, if it were 'history', it would be difficult to fit the lands and events (or 'cultures') into such evidence as we possess, archaeological or geological, concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now called Europe; though the Shire, for instance, is expressly stated to have been in this region. I could have fitted things in with greater versimilitude, if the story had not become too far developed, before the question ever occurred to me. I doubt if there would have been much gain; and I hope the, evidently long but undefined, gap* in time between the Fall of Barad-dûr and our Days is sufficient for 'literary credibility', even for readers acquainted with what is known or surmised of 'pre-history'.  
I have, I suppose, constructed an imaginary time, but kept my feet on my own mother-earth for place.

And a footnote elaborates on the gap:  
&gt;\* I imagine the gap to be about 6000 years : that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages were of about the same length as S.A. and T.A. But they have, I think, quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh.

So the events of the legendarium do not fit neatly into our known history - which is obvious, I suppose - but if we were to try and place them, then only events that happened before approximately 4000 B.C. would have been concurrent with the *Lord of the Rings* and earlier history of the legendarium.

One thing to understand is that territory won from Mexico is not considered part of the South in this timeline, due to it being large enough to be it's own region. The ""core"" Southern states are known as the ""Deep South"" and have no Northern military presence (more than normal). This ""Deep South"" (consisting of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina) plus Florida and Louisiana are the more industrialized part of the South. Southern states west of the Mississippi wanted Union troops to protect them from Indian and Mexican raids, they would be open to a permanent garrison. 

A hostile Britain is certainly at the start a detriment to the US economy, but the US can search for other trade partners. And with the British being forced to allow US ships to pass (this was part of the war of 1812) they can trade with Europe as they please. American and British relations were already poor, especially during the 1860s, but profit is one of the best motivators there is, so I think a trade between both nations will still happen similar to OTL.

It’s been invaded by indo aryans,greeks, persians, arabs, mongols, various turkic peoples, and europeans. I don’t understand why you guys seem to think India was this homogenous hindu state where everyone rode elephants and spoke hindi until the british came. Chandragupta spoke a different language (hell modern india has like 40 unique recognized languages all of which are very different, not to mention the fact that Gandhi mainly spoke English), he had a different religion than almost all modern indians, he was quite possibily a now extinct ethnicity and the demographics of his land were much different. The Mauryan empire encompassed more than just modern India and if you take a look at those countries, they all have their unique cultures, art and architecture. So its absolutely ludicrous to claim that there is continuity. Chandragupta lived around the same tim if not a bit later than Alexander, tell do ancient Greeks and the Byzantines have continuity? If thats not the case then why the fuck do you think Chandragupta has continuity with Gandhi? Theres like nearly 2400 years between them! Saladin and Celopatra and their people have far more in common than Chandragupta and Gandhi, I’m sorry but the fact that you think there is continuity just proves you still have a really dumb stereotypical view of the Indian subcontinent and don’t really understand the shear diversity there and seem to think they’ve been a homogenous people for 4000 years or something.

We went with AncestryDNA because they break Asia into three separate DNA regions: South Asia, East Asia and Central Asia. I believe 23 and me only has South and East Asian DNA categories, so if more regional granularity is important to you i think AncestryDNA has a slight edge.

Unfortunately neither test will give you a break down of WHERE in South Asia your ancestors are from, which is unfortunate as the populations in many regions are quite homogeneous. I think it's because of smaller sample size for non - Caucasian / European people.

The Palatine Chapel (Italian: Cappella Palatina), is the royal chapel of the Norman kings of Sicily situated on the first floor at the center of the Palazzo Reale in Palermo, southern Italy.

Also referred to as a Palace church or Palace chapel, it was commissioned by Roger II of Sicily in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the mosaics being only partially finished by 1143. The sanctuary, dedicated to Saint Peter, is reminiscent of a domed basilica. It has three apses, as is usual in Byzantine architecture, with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical columns.

The chapel is notable for its fusion of influences, reflecting the melting pot of Sicily at the start of the XII century. The floor plan is a Latin cross basilica, decorated by Byzantine mosaics commissioned from Constantinople, with interventions from Arab craftsmen, as seen in the ceiling decorated by [typical muqarnas](https://i.imgur.com/GuQkZly.jpg).

The ceiling is particularly interesting because it is decorated, contrary to the Muslim prohibition on figurative decoration, with [profane scene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Arabischer_Maler_der_Palastkapelle_in_Palermo_002.jpg) depicting King Roger and its court.",True,1,1517558808,,False,0,dtm7rex,True,t3_7uptjy,t3_7uptjy,/r/europe/comments/7uptjy/the_arabnormanbyzantine_palatine_chapel_cappella/dtm7rex/,1518852211,20,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

Sir_Toasty,,,"It depends on what you plan to use the car for, and how long you plan to keep it. 

For example if you live in the city/suburbs and don't often take long trips then a 4-door hatch may be good fit for you, conversely if you live in the rural area with unsealed roads a 4WD could be a better bet. 

As for SUV's once gain it can depend, SUV's can be relatively crappier than the Sedan/wagon/hatch platforms they are based on, they eat more fuel(usually because of their weight), they often perform poorer in emergency avoidance and braking situations(also weight related), and AWD/4WD systems can create expensive repair costs in the long run if you don't look after them, as well as usually being more expensive than the equivalent non-SUV hatch/wagon. 

For family cars if space isn't a issue(despite what the snobs tell you otherwise) Commodores/Falcons are fine family cars that have cheap parts available, and are easy and cheap to get serviced anywhere, Camry's are also fine but a bit smaller and most of the Japanese and Korean makes aren't bad for Cost and reliability, Euro's in general can be more expensive to get parts for and that is a factor you should consider for over the longer term, and if you want more than 5 Seats(if you want to bring the kids friends with you) people movers can be a good option, the modern 8 seat Kia Carnival gets good reviews and is more 'car like' than most similar size SUVS and a little bit cheaper(A relative bought one against the Kluger and a few others based on those factors when they needed more than 5 seats, and they had fit 3 baby seats in the Commodore Sportswagon they owned before that). 

Also don't forget to check things like minimum octane ratings for fuel, whereas Commodores and Falcons will be fine on regular RON-91 Fuel, more modern Euro and Japanese Cars can require RON 95 Fuel as a minimum(generally due to RON-95 being the 'regular' fuel in Europe) and more performance models across all manufacturers can require RON-98 fuel, also be careful with diesel cars, as modern ones often have Diesel Particulate Filters which can require extra things for you to do to maintain them and avoid an expensive replacement(or in the case of recent reports, fires in a particular model after they have driven through grass fields). 

Don't forget to factor in Servicing schedules, some require 6 months, some allow up to 12 months, some may only get 10,000kms between services, some may get 15,000kms(that being on the 'whatever comes first' basis) so once again, a low km 12 monthly schedule may be fine for in the city, but a higher km schedule may require less services in the country. 

In the end, you have to decide what you want out of the car, and buy appropriately, if a SUV fits the bill of your requirements then don't feel bad about owning one.",True,0,1517566244,,False,0,dtmau1e,False,t3_7upkc2,t3_7upkc2,/r/australia/comments/7upkc2/if_no_to_a_suv_what_car_for_a_family/dtmau1e/,1518853681,5,False,australia,t5_2qh8e,public,

TheEyeDontLie,,,"Ernest awoke with a yelp of panic, followed by a groan of nausea. His head was hanging off the edge of the bed. He felt suffocated. During his restless sleep, his sheet had tangled with his clothes. He rolled around, untwisting his limbs and pulling his head back on top of the lumpy mattress. He didn't have a pillow. Wriggling, with some effort, Ernest placed his skull against the concrete wall. It felt hard and firm. It too moved, but more like a gently breeze. Swallowing hard and dry, he faught to control his balance. The room swayed and rocked, as his mind stumbled into the day, like a pirate fresh at a sketchy port.  &amp;nbsp; 
""Water... Please..."" Ernest croaked, but nobody was there to hear him. He was, like always, alone. There was no water either. Creaking his eyes open a crack, one at a time, he looked around. It was a plain room. A room couldn't be much more basic without being a prison cell. ""At least a prison a prison cell would have water"", mumbled Ernest as he grasped for an open bottle. The beer spilt. Blood temperature and sticky, the stale beer rolled over his chest, and pooled underneath his armpit. He rolled over some more. Sip. He winced. Sip. He eyes began to open again. Sip, gulp. Ernest sat up and coughed, a short and violent fit. He half fell out of bed as the heat, humidity, and hangover waged war on him. He kicked the sheets off the bed, along with his flip-flops, and lay back down. Keeping his bare feet on the ground helped slow the earthquakes. Eyes shut once more, Ernest finished the rest of the warm,but wet, beer. One hand fumbled for the cigarettes in his pocket. The other hand waved weakly in the air, only a white rag short of declaring surrender, as he hunted for the switch for the fan. After a minute or so, he had both tasks completed, and puffed a cheap cigarette as the cracked and squeaky desk fan blew the harsh smoke away. It was too hot. His head hurt.  &amp;nbsp;  
 
A few minutes later, Ernest was on his feet. He observed for damage from the previous evening, as he couldn't remember coming home. He couldn't remember much after the first few tequilas actually, now that he thought about it. Or rather, didn't think about. The room looked the same as always. There were the bare whitewashed walls, insect stained and cracking. Empty bottles, trash, and his few meager belongings still littered the filthy floor. Everything, of course, was covered with a fine layer of sand and dog hair. The duct tape holding the mosquito netting over the window had come loose again. He'd have to fix that, although with the two inch gap under the door, he doubted it'd make much of a difference. Besides, he'd become used to constantly itching. He could buy malaria pills at the pharmacy in town, and the dengue mosquitoes flew during the daytime anyway. Ignoring his flip-flops, Ernest grabbed a few coins from the old wooden table and pushed his way into the blinding sunlight.  &amp;nbsp; 
 
The corner store was only a few minutes from home, and the walk did freshen him up a little. It was noisy here, but a peaceful kind of noise. Waves crashing formed the backdrop, while over that, softened by the thick, tropical air, dogs barked, scooters growled, and birds, insects, and babies all did their thing. Ernest walked through a blur. The store had everything you needed. Everything, at least, if you didn't want to jump in a beat up old taxi van to town. For Ernest, it was more than enough. He got a gallon of water, fresh coconut juice in a plastic bag, two eggs, a few bread rolls, a chilli, a red pepper, a bunch of spinach, a giant bottle of beer, and a small bottle of café-mezcal. The owner and his brother brewed the mezcal themselves. The finest local moonshine, made from the regions particular, unique agave plant, blended with sugar and coffee from another town nearby. It was cheap, strong, and highly caffeinated- suitable for breakfast, lunch, or an evening digestif. Given his head today, Ernest swore never to touch the ""special green"" blend again. Weed and liquor obviously didn't mix well with him. The tramadol and cocaine probably hadn't helped either. Last night had been too crazy. He hoped he wouldn't repeat it again tonight. 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Feeling much better now after the walk and downing the coconut juice, Ernest walked slower, enjoying the sights. You could tell the tourists here by how fast they walked. How fast they did everything. In the store, a European couple had gotten impatient at the slowness. The owner had just given them a big smile, then turned back to Ernest, who was practicing his Spanish. They always entertained each other, and he was a good, repeat customer.

ShadowofDarkness666,,,"Great post. I'd like to point out though, at the risk of sounding pedantic, that China is not a *global superpower*. The word superpower is thrown around casually a lot nowadays. And I'd let it slide in most cases, but you explicitly prefixed 'global' before the word, and it irked me.

The word 'superpower' implies overwhelming dominance within the global economy, significant political influence within the international community and in multilateral institutions, underwriting security architectures in various different regions of the world. But a superpower also needs to have the capability to project considerable power beyond its own region, and across the globe. People may like to believe that military power is less relevant today than in previous centuries, and that may be so. But no more in this century than in previous centuries can a state become a viable hegemon without the capability to intervene militarily to effect the outcome of conflicts or to prevent conflicts. A superpower needs to have alliances throughout the world, that would not only allow it a logistical capability to project its military power, but also to call upon those allies to form a coalition when undertaking any substantial effort whether through coercive diplomacy, economic sanctions, or military action. 

China today has a sum total of 1 ally, North Korea, which is often more of a liability than an asset. Even the most ardent advocates of Chinese power are under no illusions as to how many allies China could count on in an actual war, especially a war of choice. The number of countries China could rally to put into place an effective sanctions regime is also something more likely to be counted in single digits, for the foreseeable future(unless the United States goes full protectionist alienating the rest of the world, creating a vacuum for China to fill in). When considering the ability to project power, it is true that China has considerable and ever-growing economic influence over several countries in different regions of the world, but those countries are unlikely to concede strategic interests to economic coercion unless China can stitch up a broad-based coalition of countries to back its cause. When it comes to military power, the situation becomes more bleak. The hard truth is that China would struggle to deploy and sustain even 200,000 troops thousands of miles away and would likely struggle in any offensive war outside its region. Without the capability to actually wield military power in every part of the world, and the security alliances to go with it, China will never be able to influence the actual balance of power and underwrite stability for regions outside its own. Economic prowess may give China some influence or leverage over countries, but without military and diplomatic power, China will not gain a place within the security architecture of the Middle East, or that of South America or Europe. One also has to consider whether China would ever accumulate the political and diplomatic capital necessary to secure international legitimacy through the UN for its military interventions. China's revisionist and aggressive posturing on territorial disputes has already stirred a regional backlash against it. Other countries are more wary of Chinese power than eager to cooperate and work with it. People who decry American foreign policy as imperialism forget that the 'American Empire' is largely one by invitation. Other nations seek American power to balance their threatening neighbours and provide stability to the region. There are various factors why American power is alluring and tolerable, even if frustrating in some instances, for most states as opposed to hegemons of the past. I'd prefer not to get too much into that.(Geography, politics, enlightened self-interest instead of narrow interests). But suffice to say that unless Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and other democracies in the region are ready to kowtow to Chinese hegemony, China will never be able to exercise the kind of influence that the United States enjoys, even in its own backyard. China seeks a sphere of influence in the region which would clash with other countries' interests, and thus be an existential threat to some and a great cause for concern to others. The strength of a superpower should be judged by whether it has varied leverages at its disposal to react to developments in international affairs. For example, the United States enjoys considerable military, economic, political and diplomatic leverage in every region of the world, in some cases unparalleled and undisputed. It can utilize these robustly and efficiently to achieve the desirable outcome, or more likely prevent the worst possible outcome, in a particular crisis. However China currently only has economic leverage over some countries, with little ability to wield sanctions as efficiently as the United States and the European Union. China doesn't even have undisputed military superiority in its own region. If economic coercion fails, China has no other leverage to utilize in South America, Middle East, Europe and even parts of Asia. Hardly a superpower by any semblance of the definition of the word, especially a 'global' one. 

And yet China is more than a great power. One could say it is a great power on the verge of being a regional superpower. A 'global' superpower status, or as I would call an actual superpower, is at least two decades away. Even the Soviet Union could not match the power projection capabilities or the political influence of the United States. It remains to be seen how China does in the future. China is the aspiring superpower. As for India, it still hasn't cemented its position as a great power, let alone aspire to be a superpower. Not too long ago, most people would have classified it as a middle power. India is not an 'up and coming super power'. It's a new great power which has a long way to go.

As for the West doing nothing 'because it can't do anything', I think this is almost similar to what Obama did in Syria, provide the American people a false choice between inaction and total war. I am not in favour of any military action either, but to say we can't do **anything** is escapism at its worst.


[How the U.S. Can Help Resolve the Rohingya Crisis](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/burma-myanmar/2018-01-04/how-us-can-help-resolve-rohingya-crisis)
&gt;The United States is the most important player here. During the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, Washington led the international community in welcoming Myanmar out of a self-imposed exile that had lasted since a military coup in 1962. In 2012, after Myanmar’s first free election in over 20 years, Obama restored diplomatic relations and sealed the new relationship with a personal visit; in 2016, he dropped most remaining U.S. sanctions. Perhaps the United States moved too quickly—but it should consider making clear to Myanmar’s leadership that this move is not irreversible. **The leverage that helped push the Myanmar military to accept limited democratization—the United States’ pivotal role in either facilitating or complicating Myanmar’s entry into the global economic order—is still available for use. The sanctions on trade and investment, which Obama eliminated by executive order, could be reimposed: some by presidential action alone, others with the cooperation of Congress; sanctions on individuals within the Myanmar military and civilian leadership could be greatly expanded; while the United States is not itself a supplier of military hardware to Myanmar, it could press its security partners (including Israel, India, France, and Germany, all of which have sold arms to Myanmar in the past decade) to shut down cooperation**.  Some analysts argue that China remains Myanmar’s largest investor and security partner and that Beijing would gladly serve as Myanmar’s international sponsor without any consideration of human rights. This is true—but it was also true before the Saffron Revolution of 2007, which set the wheels of democratization in motion. Myanmar’s leaders, and more important the country’s population, have already proven that they do not want to remain pawns of China.

There are various ways to exert influence short of a military intervention. However, given this administration's total lack of leadership in confronting human rights violations or authoritarian governments, other than Iran and North Korea, and it's crusade to wreck the State Department, undermine American alliances in Europe and Asia, and it's narrower interpretation of American 'national interests', it is doubtful whether any concerted effort will be undertaken by the United States. And has so often has been pointed out in the past, including your own post, when the United States does not provide leadership, the rest of the world is unlikely to undertake large efforts precisely because they lack the political, diplomatic, and military power necessary to rally a large coalition of varied nations together. And so the international community is largely going to sit this one out.

KierosDOW,s1 46 team-46 country-eng,Sunderland,"No we aren't. We blame the board for their poor financial decisions and the managerial merry-go-round system that they have employed at the club. There's a clear cycle. 

Manager buys player, high fee high wages 

Manager gets sacked. 

New manager comes in, doesn't like the players the old manager bought so either sells them for a loss, or just leaves them on the bench during games.

New manager then buys his own players. High fee high wages.

Rinse and repeat.

This leads to debt and thus less funds to improve the team. Add that to the owner wanting to sell the club and not wanting to invest more that he already has.

We haven't even been in this situation for 10 years. 2010/2011 was our best year by far, but poor decisions meant that we only finished 10th, when we were challenging for European places around Christmas (6th). We only picked up 10 points from February to the end of the season, with the sale of Bent and Injuries to players being the main reason.

Our situation now is dire because we have no money, and we have needed to sell or loan out our best players to get the wages off our books. If you want bad board decisions look no further that Jack Rodwell, who remains to be on £70,000 a week after saying he wanted to leave for footballing reasons, despite turning down a loan move on deadline day. Over the years we have signed too many players who are happy to sit around every week and show no effort on the pitch. Grayson didn't work out for us, and he made a real shitshow of our goalkeeping situation. Coleman looks like the right man for the job, but he is largely restricted on having to sign young players on loan. For once we have a manger who only wants to bring players who are up for the challenge we face for the rest of the season.

Injuries have also played a big part in our misfortune, but Moyes wasn't one of the main reason we went down last year. He didn't play some of our best players, made poor transfer decisions, and spent the whole season talking about how we were going to be in a relegation fight, whilst having the enthusiasm of a crippled pony. Look at the difference between the players under Allardyce and then Moyes. There's a complete lack of effort under Moyes, who failed to motivate the team for all 38 games of the season. 

West ham aren't a wrong choice club. Moyes is a wrong choice manager. We were the wrong choice for him because he wasn't up for the fight. He did wonders at Everton, but that was a long time ago. His managerial record speaks for itself. West Ham have more that enough quality in their team to stay up this year.

&gt;**Fogo começou por volta das 2h e não havia funcionários no galpão da Estrada do Tindiba.**  


&gt; Um grande incêndio atingiu o centro de distribuição dos Correios na Estrada do Tindiba, em Jacarepaguá, na Zona Oeste do Rio, na madrugada desta sexta-feira (2). O fogo começou por volta das 2h, e, por isso, não havia funcionário no local. Segundo os bombeiros, ninguém ficou ferido. As chamas atingiram boa parte da estrutura, que acabou desabando. Durante a madrugada, os moradores foram acordados com o barulho das explosões. Bombeiros de três quarteis deram apoio ao Corpo de Bombeiros de Jacarepaguá. No início desta manhã as chamas já tinham sido controladas e os bombeiros trabalhavam no rescaldo.

Moooow_Montoya,JuanPabloMontoya,Juan Pablo Montoya,"Basically this.

He was not the most focused driver, not the best allround driver, not the calmest driver and not the best driver. But I honestly can't remember a driver that wild and reckless (actually I can, his name is Max). When he and Fernando and Kimi joined F1 those were the  drivers that would challenge Michael. Kimi and Fernando only occasionally (and especially with Alonso you could see that he had a lot of respect for Schumi), but JP did it all the time. And Michael didn't really have that before. He enjoyed his fair and square rivalry with Häkkinen they always showed respect during driving, he had clashes with Hill and Villeneuve, but not that many and not over such a period of time.

Brazil 2001 was his third (?) race, he did similar  in Europe 2003, Italy 2003, San Marino 2004, Belgium 2004 (and probably also a few times in 2002, but I am no expert on that season), these being the ones I immediately think of. He said that he had no respect for Michael (in terms of ""Oh, I can't do that""), but he acknowledged Michael as a rival and top class driver.

I say I would've liked to have had him in F1 for a few more years, but when the motivation's gone, the wildness would also be gone. Right now I am happy we have Verstappen who has that same spirit, although in contrast to JP, Verstappen has to acknowledge his own mistakes.

EU has enough geopolitical and economic clout to not only make such regulation, but also see it enforced realistically. Even then it will be a strugle to enforce on say a company that has no branch in EU and only accesses EU market via internet services. Still EU can have some confidence on atleast somelevel of enforcement.

Case in point from the article. EU sees this enforced for Japanase corporations, because Japan and EU negotiated a FTA and EU put GDPR enforcement as one conditions for agreeing to said FTA.

Which pretty much means from now: you want FTA or other trade deal with EU. EU will say, well firstly you agree to our regulatory regime for your companies accessing our market including GDPR. Which pretty much makes GDPR global standard, since apporently people like to trade on favorable terms with 500 million strong trading block.

&gt; O bitcoin experimentou, novamente, uma queda vertiginosa que levou o preço da criptomoeda mais famosa do mundo para baixo dos US$ 8 mil na manhã desta sexta-feira. Como efeito, todo o mercado de criptomoedas também se desvalorizou nas últimas semanas, com as cotações de Ethereum e Ripple, segunda e terceira moedas virtuais mais valiosas do mundo, caindo 29,5% e 36,5%, respectivamente, nas últimas 24 horas (dados do CoinMarketCap). Todo o mercado de criptomoedas sofreu uma queda significativa nas últimas 24 horas. O mês de janeiro costuma ser um período de baixa para as criptomoedas, o que deixa muitos investidores tranquilos e até animados para continuar investindo no setor. Contudo, movimentações em prol da regulamentação das moedas virtuais nos Estados Unidos ou mesmo a recente proibição desse tipo de negócio na Coreia do Sul acabaram por atingir o mercado. O mercado de criptomoedas é dinâmico e instável, portanto, tanto a queda quanto a ascensão dos preços podem acontecer de forma repentina. Será que a tendência agora é cair e não se recuperar mais ou o preço mais baixo pode justamente atrair novos investidores?

Two big problems with his plan:

1. We used Polycom phones, not Panasonic.
2. He called a phone company.

Background info: many phone systems (PBX or hosted PBX systems) have the ability to call outbound from a voicemail system.  What these scammers will do is find out the voicemail box number, then find out the password for the voicemail box.  Once they get into the voicemail box, they have complete autonomy to make calls anywhere in the world if there aren't any restrictions in place on the phone system.  This happened many times and the pattern is clear; VM gets compromised, customer's bill goes way up, then the call records show a clear pattern of calls to some country (usually either African, Eastern European, or South Asian).  Check this out for more info:  https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/voicemail-system-hacking

Hillary Clinton spontaneously becomes the leader of America and defends the country against the Russians. The war that follows destroys both America and Russia, until both Putin and Clinton admit that it doesn't make any sense anymore. In the post-apocalyptical world that follows, the two leave their leadership positions and hide away from all the trouble. One day, they meet each other in a shadowy little pub somewhere in Europe (it's safer there).

MiltownKBs,,"6'2"" Baller","Agree that it needs to be studied more.  I also think there is no answer that will satisfy everyone in this case.  Lets remove professional play from the equation and talk about college sports.  Is it fair to an athlete to have her scholarship opportunity taken away by a MTF athlete?  Is it fair to a MTF athlete to not have an opportunity to get a sports scholarship to college?  Man, not an easy topic and there is no perfect solution for everybody.  I am glad that I don't have to make these decisions.

""I see a heavily disproportionate number of MTFs at the top of all sports""

I cant prove you wrong like you ask, but I have a question for you.  Who are these MTF athletes that are at the top of all sports?

I made these comments on the last post:

The United States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage requested that a system be established to examine female athletes and the need to clarify ""sex ambiguities"" in 1936 around the time of the Berlin Olympics. The first mandatory gender test was conducted by the IAAF in 1950. Testing began at the European Athletics Championships in 1966 and the Olympics started testing in 1968.

The governing bodies of various sports have been [attempting to define gender with regards to athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports).  When the time comes, the standard they set will probably used by Colleges and High Schools.

The fair solution lies somewhere between ""let the athlete determine their gender"" and ""let traditional gender markers determine gender"". No solution will sit well with everyone. Such is life. The two extremes I mention require very little management and controls. Any solution between that will need to be managed and controlled. In real life situations, these cases will and probably are happening at the HS (or lower) levels and College. Any management and control will have an associated cost. Again, such is life. So there are legitimate concerns about fairness no matter where you sit on the topic, but there will also be a financial cost if this needs to be managed. And it will need to be managed. Should our school districts pay for this when many of them are already financially stressed? Should the athlete pay for this when many come from families that cannot easily afford to take on extra expenses? Is there some simple solution that can be part of a basic physical exam that will not cost anything more than just your co-pay? 

This is a topic that has no perfect solution and it is deeper than what it appears on the surface. I think it is clear that by the responses from raven and clover that these athletes are very aware of most arguments anyone could make and they would want a fair solution. But the solution is not an easy one and as such, nobody has one. This is why I say that the standards already being set by the organizing bodies of sports and the Olympic committee will be used as the standard. They have been modifying their approach for decades now and it would be foolish to not use their work as some sort of standard when the time comes. The problem I see is that their solutions don't appear to be cheap so how applicable to the real world are they and if their solutions are adopted, who funds this?

Definitely/Definately/Definitely [flip-flopped for me and a few others](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4pora3/definitely_changed_back/) - it is less common, I think. We also had different experienced durations - ""Definately"" was the correct word for two months for me, but others had mentioned in terms of years, weeks, etc... only other flip-flop for me was with Froot Loops/Fruit Loops.

Also, there are a fair number of people who do remember (as I do) that at one point traffic lights had red at the bottom and green at the top. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvaR1pMPjGA) highlights comments. This one is contentious to people - the majority seem to remember traffic lights as they are now from what I can tell. Not sure if you'd want to count each of the comments in that video lol

Berenstein
Dilemna

Chic-fil-A (girlfriend remembers Chic-a-fil/Chick-a-fil from Pennsylvania like ten years ago - does anyone else at all have that memory? I thought I saw a restaurant with that name long before I knew of Chic(k)-fil-A's existence.

Bible changes - especially ""Heavens"" now being ""Heaven"" in Gen 1:1 of KJV.

JFK, Fruit of the Loom Cornucopia (this might be the only one to have made my mother start to believe, although she agrees with SA shift).

Forrest Gump - Life ""is""

Lindbergh Baby - I actually thought it was found alive, then later found out it was found dead. At first I thought I experienced two changes, but since no one else has come forward remembering it being found alive, I've just decided I misread or was misinformed.

Geographical - SA (east Brazil used to line up with NYC's timezone!), AU was shaped different, more smooth and didn't reach to all the way to the Islands north of it. NZ was closer to AU and the two of them were noticeably separate from the Indonesian area in general. Cabrera wasn't AU's capital - it used to be Sydney for me, then became Melbourne (I decided I thought it was Sydney before that's the largest city) and I know for a fact it was Melbourne for quite a while, not Cabrera. I did a middle-school project on Brazil (ironically AU and Brazil were always favorites of mine as a kid/teen) and I'm pretty sure it was either Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, definitely not ""Brasilia."" Both Cabrera and Brasilia are district cities, like Washington D.C., but I'm not fully sure what to make of why this is - I guess a future war that would destroy NA, EU, and much of Asia would need countries like Brazil, Australia, etc... to be in better structured and efficient capacities to become the new world leaders? That's if the idea that these are time manipulations by the future as some speculated - it would also explain why SA has moved, as well as AU... maybe they are in better strategic positions to stay out of any US/NATO-Russia-China conflict.

DirtMaster3000,,,"&gt; The EU is not in a position to even negotiate a unilateral trade agreement with the United States for fuck sake.

I don't think you really know what you're talking about here. The definition of a unilateral trade agreement is a commerce treaty that's simply imposed by one country, and no other nations have a say in the matter. It is by definition not open for negotiation! https://www.thebalance.com/unilateral-trade-agreements-definition-examples-3305904

&gt; Do you realise that pairing a binding trade agreement and non-binding agreement that can be ignored would be fruitless and make one look incredibly stupid?

As for including a non-binding agreement to a binding trade deal looking stupid, the Paris Agreement is literally the only thing the world has right now. It is the only plan, strategy, and commitment (however shallow) the world as one has taken to combat climate change. Literally every country on earth has committed to this now, http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php except for the United States of America. Even Nicaragua, who originally didn't because they thought the agreement was not aggressive enough. Even Syria, who originally didn't sign because they didn't have time to concern themselves with this, as they are wrapped up in a brutal civil war. Even North Korea! But the U.S. has withdrawn...

I don't know where you're from, or your stance on climate change, but to most people, and most governments around the world it fucking matters, and the Paris Agreement is the way to show it. Getting the U.S. to commit would not be fruitless. They are the 2nd largest polluter in the world, behind China who pollute less than half of what the U.S. does per capita. http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=749

The U.S. is also supposed to be ""the leaders of the free world"", at least they like to claim they are. Moving forward in this world you cannot be a leader without taking the lead on Climate Change.

_magick_,,,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm 260 miles from Labsense, across a single European border, and still got shafted for a €404/$502 order back in mid-August. Just for good measure I paid in BTC, so what was worth $502 back then is presently worth $1,017.24. (!) 

That does nothing to diminish your loss, of course, but lest it should feel that US customers are getting a bum deal compared with the EU, hopefully that provides some balance. Much like yourself, I'm not butt hurt about it, but confused that there are still positive reports, and even subsequent newsletters from them.

I think we can go on and call it dodgy as hell; I'm not sure why they've since removed BTC payments, but the funds I sent them were swiftly swept up through a couple of other addresses until they ended up on an address controlling almost 7,000 BTC, or a little over $50m USD. Somehow, I doubt they made *that* from the rather limited product offering. (NB. This *could* be a dodgy payment processor and it is to be noted that Labsense has stopped accepting BTC, so we can't prove that they're directly a front-end to the above activity as distinct from a business caught up in a mess.)

However, what remains the case is that my order remains unprocessed on their database, my payment to their specified address went through as did my follow-up e-mails, and what they've said or done about it is... nothing. You'd think, if I can search e-mails, databases or BTC transactions, well, so could they. They gave no impression of being dead or in jail as of November, describing a 'hectic' couple of months and a new bank account.

But, indeed, griping enough; I thought I'd share as it's always nice to know there's some idiot who got burned worse... in this case, it happens to be me! Let us take the view that, defrayed over the abundance of priceless experiences to be had from the often honest market in novel RCs, it is as a piss in the ocean!

Profits on net spend indicates that a club isn’t even tapping into all its sources of revenue to fund player purchases. Again, my point is big clubs rely on revenue, not outgoing transfers, to fund incoming transfers. 

And if you have strong feelings about city’s ownership and revenues then ok - not trying to change your mind. But Barca, Real, and United don’t sit around and say “sure wish we could sell a few players to fund our incoming transfers”.. No, they buy the players they want. And if they can offset that outlay by selling players then great. But their spending isn’t dependent on that.

Mister_Dink,,,"Before you get sarcastic, I'd recommend d throroughly reading your sources. They don't particularly support your initial posting.

A) the majority of the article talks specifically about the ways women did keep from flowing free, from Greece to Rome to Europe.

Near the bottom, the article's paragraph you quoted -again doesn't state when and where such behavior took place, and talks only in generalities. ""Many women"" doesn't even specify the percentage, the social or economic class, and other necessary discussion details beyond. I admit though, I've yet to click to the menstruation muesuem link past that, that could easily she'd more light.

B) most of the post that discusses the prejeduce against period blood and religious (as in made by a caste of exclusively male) rules regarding it mentions the disgust towards periods by men of power. That would be the patriarchy instituiting rules of behavior and social politeness on women's bodies.

C) the link to India makes my argument even less necessary. Women of poverty  actively using soil and ash to prevent free flow is again, antaling points against free flow, the part of your post i was particularly asking for a source on.

D) a discussion on underwear. I should have clarified, and am therefore at fault. I am using underwear differently than the writer of the blog post. I am referring to literal layers under the out most piece of clothing, not knickers, panties, breifs. That people wore multiple insulation layers of a variety of cuts and styles is well regarded fact, and serving garments exist. People did not go commando in the way we'd use the phrase.

I'll continue reading on the museum of menstration's website, but again, the idea from free flow seems to be the shortest and least specific mention in the article.

C'est pour ça que De Gaulle ne s'est pas limité au périmètre minable de l'Europe, a reconnu la Chine de Mao et a lancé la politique de détente avec l'URSS.

I have friends in Berlin and Hamburg and they simply love your country. I've been to Europe a few times, but I'm yet to visit Germany. Still, congratulations for being an amazing country and for destroying our team in the last World Cup. I have two very different questions: 

**The division of Germany** - I have read a few things about the division of Germany after WW2 and I find it so amazing. Once I read a story about a couple who tried to flee from West Germany at the very beggining of the division. He managed to do it, she didn't. At first, she thought she would try to go to the other side a few months after, but the division was more enforced and they never saw each other again. Without social media and other practical technologies we have nowadays, they were simply split apart forever and she never managed to find him. 

Not only I find these stories heartbreaking, but I also hear there is a big cultural difference between East and West after all these years because of that. I've heard from Brazilians that the West is not as developed and more conservative than the East in general. Is that true, are they so different? Is there some sort of tension between East and West? Does it play a big part on national elections, for instance? Are there rivalries between these two cultures? 

**Ok, let's talk about that 7x1**: for football fans, how shocking was that match? When I went to California, I met a german guy who was a big football fan and he said him and his friends were blown away on the first 4 goals or so. After that, they were happy but slightly confused and surprised. Also, which Brazilian players had the most impact on Bundesliga, in your opinion?

so these companies have a VERY valid reason as to why its all custom (they likely have a bunch of computer engineers who can write this stuff quickly). Their reluctance to share the source code could be from them making features that differentiate them selves being copied by a competitor.

As it was, they just came out with lies about the economic benefits (e.g. £350m pw to the NHS), scare stories about immigration (e.g. 80m Turks about to have the right to enter Britain), and some vague, fanciful idea that we would actually be in a stronger position to negotiate trade deals outside of one of the worlds largest trading blocks - against all facts and logic.

The fact is that most 'sober' analyses, before and since, agree that leaving the EU would be most likely to damage the UK economy. e.g:

REMagic42,TEXT,Besinnungspolizei,"&gt; Both the people and political parties mostly against entering the EU, correct? Is there any sizeable minority or political party in favor of that in the country?

This is a new sentiment. In the 90s, there was a vote to join, and it narrowly failed. After that, with the recent problems the EU has had (e.g. Greece, financial crisis), support for the EU has dramatically dropped. Now every party right of center sees it as ""foreigners dictating our policy!"" or ""needless bureaucracy overregulating the free market!"". Only the left parties see some goo in the EU. They oppose the neo-liberal policies of the EU, but they are in favor of internationalism and often say that they want to have a vote in all the EU's decisions that eventually affect Switzerland anyway.

But, if we were to have a vote right now, it would be clearly rejected, and even the Leftists voting for entering the EU would not do it out of sympathy with the EU in its current form.

&gt;What are the main differences between the people from the different speaking parts of the country? Are Swiss politics divided among their speaking regions like Belgium?

YES! In French-speaking Switzerland, the right-wing SVP stands no chance while the Social Democrats are really strong. In the German-speaking part, it's the opposite. Also, on leftist issues, the French-speaking part usually votes in favor, while the German-speaking part declines. However, this also has a rural-urban component to it.

Dans sa chronique avec Paul Arcand le 15 août 2017:

&gt;Depuis 2008, y'a eu 5 projets de loi [à propos des accomodements raisonnables].

&gt; 2008 Yolande James, 2010 [...], 2014 Drainville, la charte, le PQ est minoritaire; ça passe pas. 2015 le projet de Stéphanie Vallée, et là on est en 2017.

&gt; Les Québécois se disent, y'a tu moyen qu'on vote qqchose? Un minimum?

I mean, il a le droit d'avoir une opinion, c'est un chroniqueur. Le but c'est un peu d'avoir un parti pris.

Mais le PQ Drainville-Marois a pas voulu s'allier avec la CAQ pour voter ""un minimum"" de la carte, c-à-d la charte moins le boutte avec les signes religieux ostentatoires, préférant aller en élections, mais là maintenant que Drainville est à la radio, il réécrit l'histoire et fait semblant que le PQ s'est fait forcer de pas passer une réglementation à cause des méchants partis d'opposition?

Cet homme-là est de mauvaise foi et embellit son passé politique -- un piège dans lequel même Mario Dumont, alors qu'il était novice en médias et populaire de son passé politique, avait pas fait (à mon avis) -- et à cause de ça, il mérite pas d'avoir des chroniques politiques, encore moins une émission de radio.

jazimov,,,"As a Brit and a recent Eagles convert after visiting a friend that lives in Philly in November this is my assessment. I've always liked the NFL but I've never had a team until now because the way sport is supported in America has always seemed a bit too much of a packaged product to me. 

Like, the fact that the Browns could be moved to Baltimore and then renamed before being reformed in Cleveland with the same name is the best example of this. They tried this in the UK with Wimbledon F.C. that moved to Milton Keynes. Everyone now hates Milton Keynes because, instead of making a football club they just bought one. The new Browns get more shit than the Ravens because the ""movable franchise"" idea is just accepted in the NFL. It doesn't make the sport bad, its just weird. To contrast, the ""MK Dons"" aren't a real team and anyone that supports them is basically seen as an idiot with no idea of what fan loyalty is. You can't just buy a team and move it across the country. 

For example, my friend supports a team called Notts county, who are the oldest pro team in the world. The last time they won anything worthwhile was in 1894, an FA Cup (which nobody gives a shit about these days). They haven't even been in the final of that for over a century. In contrast Nottingham Forest, who's stadium is less than a mile away, have won the European cup twice and aren't great any more but he could easily be a supporter and bask in some glory. He doesn't care. He goes every week to watch unfit division 3 players make the same mistakes in the cold damp and dark English winter. He probably pays about £400 a year to do this. He's hated the players, the management, the coaching staff, the ground, the sponsors and the owners for years. He doesn't do this because its fun, he does it because its his team and he has no choice.

Lyft along with it's series of flimsy seeming partnerships, has started hiring autonomous driving engineers as well. 

Uber's real competition is from the other big global rideshare companies: Didi, Grab, and Ola. Interestingly, SoftBank has spread multi billion dollar bets across all these companies, and then not-yet fully tapped potential for these companies is in  developing world megacities where public transportation infrastructure can't come anywhere close to handling the insane growth. 

Karachi Pakistan, for instance, grew 80% in less than a decade to a population of about 20 million people. (Try to imagine a North American or European city growing that much, it's insane). 

In cities like this, where few people own cars, and commutes from exurban shanty towns to factories where there's work are getting longer. Transportation in these markets are served predominantly by a hodge podge of private services using all manner of crazy vehicles, (I once counted 21 people in a single pickup truck, 5 in the cabin and 16 in the bed). 

It's the big rideshare companies that have the capability of bringing sophisticated logistical oversight, accountability and security to these kinds of developing world markets.

&gt;Putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between trust within communities and their ethnic diversity. His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that, other things being equal, more diversity in a community is associated with less trust both between and within ethnic groups.

The style actually originated in Indonesia and was then produced in Holland via the Dutch East India company. The new Dutch prints didn't sell in Indonesia, so they were marketed heavily in West Africa, where people embraced them and gave them new meaning. The designs have changed and flourished due to West African aesthetic preferences since then, and now many of the prints are designed in Europe, produced in China, and sold in Africa. That's not to say they're any less ""African"" because they've been so thoroughly integrated into everyday African life - but their history is a complicated mixture of local preferences and colonial legacies.

BOAGRIAS,,,"Hiya mate, definitely not my best car for knowledge, even if the earlier Spiders are one of my favourite cars! I can only offer some general info based on what iv learnt along my way, as for how relevant that will be for you being in the US and myself in Europe I don't know.. Soo take it or leave it as you wish! 

Firstly it's a mk III (I believe?!) meaning it will always be the cheapest and least desirable option, serious collectors want an older original but there is a market for the cars regardless of year as they are quite iconic and will always have a value based on that IMO. Will that value rise hugely? My honest prediction would be no, will it be worth more in the summer however, yes! Convertibles always sell in the summer..

I can't tell you parts availability or cost from here but being Italian I can't imagine the used car market is massive in the US, however being a later car it should have readily available parts but expect to pay for exporting I guess!
  
As for the car, iv not learnt a lot about issues but at a guess, rust.. Shouldn't be so bad being in the US but old Alfas are renowned for melting away my obvious guesses would be jacking points and floor pan! Secondary would be electrics, Italian electrics have a reputation for being flaky and some of the looms iv seen in Alfas certainly supports this! And finally, my big check would be the roof. Do you have a garage? As cars of this age and build are often not as waterproof as you might like to think.. If you intend to hold the car for a while be mindful of that. Based on your post, you will know what to check for as far as engine, gearbox and drive go! As for working on the car.. Alfas in my experience are awkward, they seem to do everything completely different to everyone else but being a small 2.0 litre with a big bonnet, I imagine access should be relatively easy.

Remember it's an 'older car' and so be prepared for cold start problems, electrical/water ingress issues and the odd hiccup when you least need it! But if you do break down.. It's better to breakdown in style and the Spider certainly ticks that box! 👍 My personal opinion, I would prefer an older model if I was buying to collect, if however I was buying to drive for a bit or sell, I'd be less fussy but my final tip would be, if you don't know Alfas do your homework on some forums before committing to anything!

A_Notorious_Nobody,,,"&gt;Expanding Perimeters of Censorship Algorithms

The ultimate tactical philosophy to use as your guiding star when combating censorship is to force them to expand the defining parameters within the censoring algorithms so as to start seeing large swaths of unrelated, unoffensive Normie content being caught up with all the various means we use to currently bypass them. That level of censorship will be untenable at a business level. Just as zebras blend in with the crowd, so must we weave our language into that of the Normies in order to best avoid algorithmic censorship. An example of this would be recent Chinese censorship of Winnie the Pooh after comparisons between Pooh and President Xi went viral.

&gt;L337 Speak / Alternative Spellings / Intentional Misspelling / Deceptive Spellings

A Must Read - https://www.wikihow.com/Read-and-Write-in-1337

LEET (1337) is a written language or cipher used in online gaming, e-mails, text messaging, tweeting, and other electronic communication. The root of the term ""leet"" is the word ""elite""--translated as 31337--and 1337 was initially developed as an exclusionary language: a way to encode text so that messages could only be read by the initiated. The defining characteristic of 1337 is substitution of symbols and numbers for letters (for example, in the term ""1337,"" 1=L, 3=E and 7=T), but the language has also developed to include intentional misspellings, phonetic spelling, and new words. If you want to familiarize yourself with 1337, or if you're just curious about it, this article will explain the basics of how to read and write in this ever-changing language.

&gt;Foreign Language Letters &amp; Words

As with L337 Speak, there are already numerous foreign languages that have their own unique alphabet with letters that largely look like ours. In order to have a censorship algorithm, you have to program the parameters, and do so in such a way as not to censor content you're not intending to target, lest you generate outrage amongst the Normies. So, when ""Islam"" is used as a ""Hot"" word to pick out which pieces of binary to target, did they also program into the algorithm filter to look out for ""Islam"", or ""Islam"", or ""Islam"", or any of the other possible combinations? In this case, you'll want to envision the word as a scrolling character padlock, but in reverse. Their job is to program in every combination to block the access of your speech. Yours is to keep shuffling the characters till you find a combo they haven't thought of yet.

Likely Not.

You can find keyboard apps with these characters or the manual work-around, C&amp;P a full list of extra-English characters to a notepad app, create your word word, C&amp;P to any text input that triggers predictive spelling, program your custom word into your personal library. A few uses will give it priority in program.

&gt;George Carlin's Rule of Adding Syllables

George Carlin has a popular bit he did on euphemisms, political correctness, increasingly adopting terminology designed to dehumanize and sterilize language through increasing syllables. Often to the point of inanity. It's time we begin using that against them.

I would encourage everyone to digest his analysis and apply its wisdom &amp; lessons to outsmart censorship algorithms designed by people who think stringing long words together qualifies as a substantive argument.

&gt;Altering Terminology / Thesaurus &amp; Dictionary / Couching Your Language

Keeping in mind the above, a thesaurus and dictionary will provide constant work-arounds for the censors. Another aspect is in altering the terminology we use, in order to;

1. Reclaim ground previously lost by allowing our opposition to define and determine the terminology we use to discuss controversial topics. Any normal person who uses ""cisgender"" in anything other than an analysis or satire, is an example of this.

2. Bypass ""Hot Words"" by using terminology they haven't taken into account yet, including Normie terminology. If we can't talk about ""Islam"", maybe we can talk about ""Mohamedanism"", or the ""Cult of Mohamed"".

&gt;Use it &amp; Lose it Rule for Banned Memes

So, we find our memes being censored as well. Now, I have noticed that posts that are deleted after being reported, but before being adjudicated, do not result in a Zucking. When engaging those whom we think likely to report us, posting a highly offensive meme is risky business, unless you delete in within 5 minutes of posting, after you intended target has seen it, after its done its job, but before you can have it used against you.

&gt;Hotwords/Notwords - Filtered into Silence

I think its pretty clear that there are certain ""Hotwords"" that trigger especially capricious interpretations of their Codes of Conduct. Thusly, it would be only logical to presume that they have ""Notwords"" that trigger a more lax interpretation of the Code of Conduct, in order to prevent their Leftist Lapdogs from being caught up the same filters that catch us.

&gt;Foreign Language Translation Catapult Teams

Based Pepe Le Pew is looking for help fighting the globalists from First Amendment protected Based 'Mericans. The two team up, combine their efforts to develop effective memetics in French, with the American being the one doing the posting. Being unable to prosecute us Americans will inspire many tears of impotent rage amongst the EU authoritarians, whilst red pilling Euros. This will better translate the successes we had with Brexit and Trump to non-English societies.

&gt;Sanitizing &amp; Colorizing Language

Remember that Bill Nye Junk Stuff video, it starts off with the DJ giving a shout out to all the fellow bipeds who identify as yada yada. We know ""Rape"" is a definite 'Hotword'. I've been Zucked for 3 word posts with that being the only possible 'Hotword', has to do with the rape epidemic thanks to the Mohamedan invaders. ""Bipeds who identify"", instead of ""People"" is an example of breaking down communication and concepts to their most basic building blocks. That tactic can be used to sanitize language and communication. To sterilize it, as well.

But it can also be used to enrich communication while sanitizing it from specific 'Hotwords'. They want to stop us using such triggering words and terms to avoid triggering the emotions that come from those words and the ideas they convey. Bad idea. Because the counter to that is abandoning those terms and using colorful, vivid, descriptive terminology to paint graphic pictures of these evil deeds they don't want spoken of. We must paint a picture with words. Thesaurus tool multiplied by foreign characters tactic feeds into the Expanding Perimeters Strategy.

&gt;Proactive &amp; Reactive Blocking

If you sense a particular person is going to be especially 'problematic' or risky, don't be afraid to pro-actively cut them off. Mind your privacy settings, and don't be opposed to reporting those who report you before blocking. That's about the only use I have for the feature.

&gt;Mirroring Platforms

Re-uploading censored or limited state videos back onto their censorious platform, as well as other free platforms is a key method of resisting censorship.

Luna_Parvulus,,,"I'm gonna throw a wild guess into the wind here - keep in mind I am by no means a snake expert. I don't even own one sadly :(. Just going off of what I've seen on this sub.

From what I've seen on this sub, most snakes can have an iridescent sheen to them if they are kept in good conditions. Given the location, it sounds like a Mexican Black Kingsnake may have been what you saw - typically it shows off its iridescence better than most other snakes.

I have no idea if the narrowing you're talking about is a vertical hood. European varieties of ratsnakes tend to have vertical hoods, IDK if anything on this side of the pond have those, or if MBKs are capable of that. Clarifying that point might help narrow something down if it did have a vertical hood.

E- [Here's](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CIRBn1Vfd2w/TBWY1z_zMpI/AAAAAAAAAGU/1pyfAfqbzhs/s1600/sunbeam-snake-01.jpg) a shot showing off the iridescence. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/CGREp.jpg) a decent resolution shot showing off what the snake looks like. From what you've said in your comment above (wasn't posted when I was writing my comment) it doesn't sound like this is the snake you're looking for though, since it does sound like it has that vertical hood. Keep in mind the iridescence is possible for most species (as far as I know) although rare to see outside of a few species (typically MBK, Eastern Indigo, and rainbow boas).",True,0,1517601574,,1517602274,0,dtn4jog,False,t3_7urz36,t3_7urz36,/r/snakes/comments/7urz36/help_identifying_weird_iridescent_snake_in_cancun/dtn4jog/,1518867854,1,False,snakes,t5_2ryfw,public,

OH1830L,,,"I'm sort of in the Transport industry as a hobby you could say so I definitely know what I'm going on about unlike the people I were speaking too. 

I've seen companies that have been really good but then get sold off to a private operator and turn to shit because the new operator is in it for the profits and bugger all else.  Take a look at Telstra (Telecommunications company) which used to be owned by the Government I think before 1995. not long afterwards was it sold off as a now private company which meant prices went up and the service literally went down a lot with them being jackasses with not taking care of their network and scraping every penny out of people they could. 

Anyway with the now private operator running the buses in the area I sorta mentioned above, they have cut bus stops (As in closed them, even some close to houses were closed) now instead of the one bus taking people where they need to go they now need to take two or 3 which takes just as long as taking the old single bus would be. 

some people have been left to walk long distances now to catch buses because their stops have been closed. I've come across people leaving comments on the local papers facebook page how some are now having to try and get over a busy highway to get the bus. If it's not the highway it's a heavy or steep hill which makes it hard for those with a disability or walking issue to get up. 

And one other I can think of is the same private operator is now buying Chinese built buses over European built ones with quality and bus bodies which are done in Australia (One bus body plant recently closed because of the lack of orders). I've already come across yet another FB post where one of the new Chinese buses which was delivered in the last couple of months is already falling apart. 

Yet none of these were a problem for the Idiot(s) I was speaking too the other day. Apparently having to catch more buses is a good thing, and it's a ""Who cares if they have to walk up a hill or highway to get to their new bus stop"" and I guess since they live nowhere near the area in question they spare no fucks at all for those that do. 

Fuck them if they want to be ignorant of the situations people now have to face here with public transport. Those same fuckwits are more than welcome to go up to that region and try the now privately owned service and see what they think of it but knowing them they won't.

BigBennP,,,"&gt;I keep on hearing that Page was under surveillance in 2013, but I don't know where people have gotten that information.

The facts that it is based on are, more or less, as follows: 

[in 2013 three russians were indicted with federal charges for illegally acting as agents of a foreign government](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/04/world/europe/document-U-S-Accuses-Three-Russians-of-Spying.html) (basically for being spies). 

[the federal indictment itself is here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/04/world/europe/document-U-S-Accuses-Three-Russians-of-Spying.html) 

The FBI indictment against those three russians alleges that on or about April 8, 2013, Victor Pobodny, one of the three russians was captured on tape discussing his efforts to recruit Male-1 to provide information to the Russian agents. 

 They had promised him business connections in Russia and he provided documents regarding the US energy industry to the Russians.    They describe him as ""enthusiastic"" and ""Hungry for a lot of money."" 

Sources related to the case have confirmed that Male-1 identified in the indictment is Carter Page. 

So, literally, Carter Page was discussed in surveillance in 2013 talking to Russian agents and giving documents to Russian agents (then posing as businessmen/investors).  However, he was not the target of that surveillance. 

In October 2016, the FBI sought a FISA warrant directly against Carter Page, and numerous sources have reported that ""Hundreds of pages"" of material discussing why there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power were submitted to the court.     It seems that these documents were among them.

redhopper,,,"Going quickly off of some screencaps online (I can only remember seeing maybe half of his films in the DVD/VHS era, all recent viewings have been on Blu Ray), the biggest aesthetic difference between the widescreen and Academy ratio that I can see in Kubrick's films is the amount of headroom on top, which to me doesn't work as well as the widescreen image.

This [shot](https://i.imgur.com/KNKbtZg.png) from Full Metal Jacket shows what I mean. His head is centered in the frame, but there's a lot of empty space at the top of the frame. It doesn't look *bad*, but it also doesn't look like it was framed specifically for 4:3. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/DAiMfq8.png) it is in widescreen. This looks a lot more natural to me. His body is taking up a full 90% of the height of the frame, with his eyes in the upper third. If I were framing this shot *just* for 4:3, I think he would be placed more like in the widescreen image, something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/tLOEERw.png).

I don't have an open matte copy of The Shining at my disposal but if I were to hazard a guess as to why that one looks better in 4:3 than some other movies is the hallway perspective present in a lot of the film, in that both the top and bottom of the frame draw one's attention toward the center of the frame naturally. The traditional medium close-up, the bottom of the frame is filled up with a person's body no matter what, and the top of the frame is always ""empty"" so it's easier to notice the composition (or lack thereof).

Edited to add: Just realized I never touched upon your mention of 1.77/78 as the one ratio we know Kubrick never used. There's a reason for that, which is that it plain old didn't exist. It was invented by TV companies when developing widescreen TV as a happy medium between the US standard of 1.85 and the European standard of 1.66. Obviously it would be nice if we could just get movies in their original ratio, and it *is* more noticeable when cropping from ~~1.77~~(edit:1.66), but I don't think Kubrick would have been ideologically opposed to it or anything. Hell, he might actually have preferred it to 1.66 since it is designed to fill up your screens, and that is what he wanted.",True,0,1517604076,,1517604524,0,dtn76r2,False,t3_7usmsb,t1_dtn4oxc,/r/TrueFilm/comments/7usmsb/kubrick_aspect_ratios/dtn76r2/,1518869112,7,False,TrueFilm,t5_2szp0,public,

textandtrowel,archaeology,Early Medieval Slavery,"I grew up on Cornwell's Sharpe series, and I really enjoy the *Last Kingdom* adaptation of his Saxon stories—but you're right to be a bit skeptical. Most popular wisdom on this period paints it as a time of religious and ethnic conflict.

Popular understanding today is really shaped by the priorities of scholars in the 1990s, when the role of ethnicity and religion in conflict was coming under close scrutiny (e.g. Kosovo). Earlier understandings had been shaped especially by a concern for states and economics—which were priorities of the Cold War—and before that, there was an intense concern for nation-states, which just so happened to correspond to the European age of nation-building in the 1800s.

The maps that scholars draw often reflect the periods that they're in. Scholars around the period of WWI thought that the medieval world could be divided into [nation-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptarchy#/media/File:Anglo-Saxon_Heptarchy.jpg), just like their own world. Today, we create [different](https://www.mysociety.org/2014/04/15/mapping-the-vikings-influence-on-uk-place-names/) kinds of [maps](https://jalapic.github.io/vikings) that are more pointillistic, and they're not too different from maps being produced of [current conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-israel-golan-heights.html), focusing on centers rather than on borders.

At any rate, if you're into the period and want a few good reads, I'd strongly recommend either Robin Fleming's *Britain after Rome* or Guy Halsall's *Worlds of Arthur*. Both offer a picture of the early medieval world that's more deeply rooted in archaeological evidence than in the priorities that 20th-century historians read into their interpretations of the sources.",True,0,1517605280,,False,0,dtn8gno,False,t3_7ue5r1,t1_dtn5it3,/r/AskHistorians/comments/7ue5r1/trying_to_find_forts_castles_and_dikes_built_in/dtn8gno/,1518869719,1,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,public,

Kinbaku_enthusiast,,,"Okay, nothing very concrete then.

First, marxism has been around for about 130 years, religion older than recorded history. So the comparison that one kills more than the other is hard to quantify in any way.

And it's always hard to get hard data on how many people die due to an ideology.

The holocaust wasn't religiously motivated, but racially motivated.

The crusades are some 40-ish battles.

I think a compelling argument that religion killed a lot of people can be made, but you picked very poor examples to highlight that.

Meanwhile marxism has caused two large countries to implode and have tens of millions die in a combination of starvation and government oppression. The estimates range from 60-100 million that died as a result of marxist ideology in the Soviet Union and The People's Republic of China.

But then on the other hand, since that was more recent, who knows how many religion would have killed if population numbers were as high back when islam was sweeping the middle-east, northern africa and parts of europe, or conquistadors were ravaging the america's?

The reason I consider marxism worse than religion is that marxism by its very nature perverts human nature and grinds down human spirit, bones and lives. Religion at least can have the claim of having done many good things as well, like preserve and spread knowledge. Without the Christian and Islamic scholars and funding, we would not have remnants of greek philosophy, for example.

The civil war in Somalia greatly increased the size of the Somali diaspora, as many Somalis moved from Greater Somalia primarily to the Arabian peninsula, Western Europe, North America, Southern Africa and Australia. There are also small Somali populations in other pockets of Europe and Asia.

Jawshey,,,"I think the author has skipped over a lot of important facts in making this video.

/1. First, the PwC report. Its conclusion that there was no gender bias is undermined by the reason it puts forth as why there is a leaning towards higher pay for male employees, which is the lack of transparency on pay. Ironically, the study does not provide its own methodology to reach the statistical findings it put forward, which even [The Times blasts as ironic](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-bbc-is-insulting-the-women-it-wronged-mfl0wg8pd):

&gt; The PwC finding of a 7 per cent gap isn’t trusted because it doesn’t reflect women’s experience and no one knows what evidence it is using. It may, for instance, have lumped all the highest-paid, mostly male presenters together in one category and declared that they are in a class of their own, so that their pay is justified. It doesn’t examine why women end up concentrated in lower-paid roles. Its methods are totally opaque. Ironically, no BBC editor would use such an unsatisfactory piece of work as a reliable source.

/2. The claim that men are harder working at the BBC contrasts with the evidence provided to the committee by Carrie Gracie, which the BBC itself substantiated. Gracie sought assurance when she was offered the job of International Editor for China that she would ‘be paid roughly in line with male international news editors’ from the then head of news gathering at the BBC, Fran Unsworth. She resigned when she found out that was not the case. It also turns out that Jon Sopel and Jeremy Bowen, international editors for the US and the Middle East respectively, were being paid significantly more than Carrie and her colleague Katya Adler, the editor for Europe, despite the latter covering arguably the most significant issue to affect Britain today - Brexit. The argument that [both male editors have come in with a ‘pay history’ as Frans Unworth](https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2018/01/31/news/fran-unsworth-i-did-not-say-carrie-gracie-was-part-time-1246473/) put forward as a valid reason for the pay gap is argue against the principal that equal work should receive equal compensation. It means that ’talent’ is not tied to performance metrics that would allow the BBC to definitively put forward the case that higher pay is attached to merit.

/3. The claim that this will affect tv license payers was addressed by Fran Unsworth when she gave evidence at the committee. By instituting pay bands, as the Civil Service currently does, men and women will be measured against the same performance objective when they are in the same roles (such as BBC News presenters). There needs to be grading rolled out across the organisation to make it so that roles of equal complexity or qualification are paid at the same rate. The BBC itself has argued that it is in favour of this proposal and is willing to implement it.

Leaving out these important facts means this argument does not engage with the core reasons that the BBC has come under so much criticism as of late and leads me to conclude that this is an argument based on political leanings, not an objective understanding of this particular circumstance.

I'll ignore your puerile attempts to rile me.

Again - an attempt to imagine that sovereignty is a binary system. You're argument is basically ""Well if the EU doesn't control every aspect of our country then we cannot be subject to them"". I've already proven this fallacious.

We are subject to the power of the EU with their directives. This is codified in their membership requirements and our own laws I linked you.

&gt;""Any EU law that supercedes our own"". Please give examples where this has actually happened, and better yet, examples where this has been to the detriment of the UK. Until then, your original point is unfortunately horseshit.

Once again - an attempt to re-frame the argument from it's original principle; the fact that a level of sovereignty has been lost. This is what matters. Whether the EU has been beneficial or detrimental is irrelevant to the already proven point that an amount of sovereignty was given away as a requirement for EU membership. That is to say - as a consequence of EU membership we have lost control over areas of law in-which the EU directives apply.

North Korea's newer coastal defense, anti-ship cruise missiles the received last year are either copies of Russian designs or directly supplied. This was definitely a warning about what they could do if they decided to ratfuck US foreign policy in retaliation. Both Russia and China have been slightly ambivalent about the new NK sanctions as it relates to energy, Russia is running their internet connection (which they're using for ransomware attacks and crypto-currency theft). That doesn't mean they aren't right that the fuel sanctions are overkill and more likely to back them too far into a corner than bring them to the table, but it's a threat to really throw a wrench in the works. Russia and China both have long-term plans to tie the Korean Peninsula to Western Europe by rail and road, that plan isn't going to get shelved because of who is living in the White House.

Importantly, the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is a bit of a socialist and has been historically anti-EU for the past 30 years.

Enfim, já li bastante sobre na última vez que houve uma discussão sobre aborto ano trazado e ano passado, e minha opinião é a seguinte, o melhor cenário possível seria que a ciência oferecesse um método para que um feto pudesse ser removido do útero e desenvolvido fora dele, se o estado quisesse então obrigar uma mulher que não quer continuar a gravidez de um feto que não possui características suficientes para ser considerado humano nos pontos que falei acima, então que o mesmo arcasse com os custos envolvidos a isso (operação de remoção do feto, manutenção e depois de criação da criança). 

Já que esse método não existe no momento então creio que a vontade da mãe em manter ou não o feto, o qual não atende às condições de personificação, no seu corpo não pode ser tratado de modo diferente (no caso, criminalizado) a uma cirurgia qualquer para remoção de um corpo estranho que se alojou no seu.

E só para complementar, pelo que tinha visto das últimas vezes que pesquisei não vi condições suficientes para personificar fetos com até 3 meses, que é quando começa o desenvolvimento do sistema nervoso se não me engano (realmente estou com preguiça de pesquisar aqui agora, mas se tu quiser conferir joga aí no Google e qualquer coisa pode falar se eu estiver equivocado), então acho que abortos deveriam ser permitidos até o terceiro mês da gravidez sem qualquer implicação legal/requerimento para tal.

The Supporters' Shield is an annual award given to the Major League Soccer team with the best regular season record, as determined by the MLS points system. The Supporters' Shield has been annually awarded at the MLS Supporters' Summit since 1999, and has been recognized as a major trophy by the league. It echoes the practice of the top European soccer leagues in which the team with the best record is the champion. Since 2006, the Supporters' Shield winner has earned a berth in the CONCACAF Champions League.

padmanek,,,"Just execute your Legal warranty under EU Law.

Remeber there's 2 warranties in EU:

* legal warranty for minimum 2 years provided by the seller
* commercial warranty provided by the manufacturer

&gt;Under EU rules you always have the right to a minimum 2-year guarantee at no cost, regardless of whether you bought your goods online, in a shop or by mail order. This 2-year guarantee is your minimum right. National rules in your country may give you extra protection: however, any deviation from EU rules must always be in the consumer's best interest.

So your British Consumer Act warranty must be equal or better than the legal warranty provided by the EU law.

* If goods you bought anywhere in the EU turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised, **the seller** must repair or replace them free of charge or give you a price reduction or a full refund.
* **Within 6 months** of receiving the goods, you need to show the trader that the goods are faulty or not as advertised. 
* **The trader** always has to provide a solution

Now **the most important part**, from the [UK specific rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/united-kingdom/index_en.htm):


*Who has to prove the presence/absence of a defect and how long do they have to do this?*

**The seller must prove that the item was not defective for the first 6 months after the delivery** of the product (""reversal of burden of proof""). After this time the consumer must prove that it was defective.

TLDR: Inform the seller that according to your legal warranty within 6 months of of purchase t**hey have to prove** that the phone was not faulty. Do not speak to LG. They did not sell you the phone. The store did. They are legally required to help you with this.

Rourensu,,,"The two main influences are ASOIAF and Pokémon. It’s a **super**-low-modern-but-**definitely**-not-urban-fantasy-secondary-world-fantasy book about a soldier in the rebellion against the empire who rescues the one-year-old prince from being executed and raises him as his own son. Twelve years later, terrorists are attempting to restore the empire and their leader is searching for the lost prince based on a prophecy. The dad is trying to find a way to keep his son safe from being discovered by the terrorists, and the son has been having dreams about (unbeknownst to him) gods from the religion of the empire, so he goes on his own adventure to discover their significance.

I have four POV characters (1 first-person and 3 third-person limited) and head the beginning of each chapter with the POV character’s name (but I have chapter numbers unlike ASOIAF). I started thinking of the book and making it like ASOIAF even before reading ASOIAF or any fantasy—mainly wanting the epic worldbuilding and plots. The first epic fantasy I read was Michael J Sullivan’s Riyria Revelations *after* I started writing the book, so I didn’t have a (epic) fantasy background prior to starting my own epic fantasy trilogy. I originally had the story in a typical medieval European setting (because it’s “fantasy”), but because I didn’t know anything about medieval fantasy things and didn’t want to do the research, I changed it to modern because that’s what I know. Pokémon was the example I had of a modern secondary-world, so I used that as the basis for my world and the limited fantasy elements.

&gt; Then I would simply discourage those people from reading my book. It's obviously not for them. :)

One of my favorite GRRM quotes is in response to people criticizing his (over) inclusion of heraldry and other things that “don’t advance the plot”:

“Well, fine. Write your own book and leave out the heraldry. I don’t care. This is my book. I’m going to put in the heraldry.”

My book is heavily character driven, where things like “the plot” are secondary with little fantasy and practically no magic. If someone wants something faster paced and/or with magic, they’re free to look elsewhere. A writing group member said after reading a chapter that he was waiting for actiony, fantasy things to happen, and when I told him that’s definitely not the kind of book it is, he looked confused. Another member mentioned that the first guy probably wouldn’t be reading my finished book, and I shrugged and agreed. Well, fine. He could write his own book and put in the actiony magic. I don’t care. This is my book. I’m going to leave out the actiony magic.",True,0,1517626225,,False,0,dtnr1pr,False,t3_7uvkqk,t1_dtnmim1,/r/writing/comments/7uvkqk/does_a_story_have_to_have_a_single_main_character/dtnr1pr/,1518878577,1,False,writing,t5_2qh2n,public,

R1. With a conservative strategy, the Asgard probably 8/10 the Empire once they can improve their ships to crush Star Destroyers. If the Asgard focus their resources, they can likely without hold against a Empire zerg-rush, or they just use guerilla tactics with their faster ships.

R2. The Death Star doesn't add much as the Asgard can still easily out run it.

The Kingdom of Francia never invades Soissons and as such remains a Germanic Nation that barely expands past the Rhine River. As a result, the Germanic Nations have never united thanks in part to the Franks with Francia, Swabia, Thuringia, Saxony, and Bavaria remaining in Germany and Burgundy migrating and expanding southwards into Iberia after retaking Christian territory from the Islamic hordes. Navarre, a Burgundian vassal state in Iberia rebels just after the death of Burgundies king in which a succession crisis began. Navarre, as a result, annexed and took much of Burgundy's vassals in Iberia. Along with this, the Kingdom of Asturias the last remnant of Christian Iberia along with Navarre begin the Reconquista. In Italy, the Lombards form a Kingdom in the North and make attempts to capture Rome but the Byzantines retake Rome and save the Pope who had been taken, hostage ending up in a dead Lombard king with no heir resulting in a union with the Bavarians. The Pope as such from his saving from the Byzantine Empire was officially recognized as successor to Rome and takes a similar path through history and politics that the Holy Roman Empire did. The Bulgarians and Magyars attempt to migrate but are stopped by the Byzantines resulting in Bulgarians in modern-day Romania and Magyars along the Azov. The Slavic migrations into the East and South result in Slavs in Pannonia in Hungary, Wendia in Eastern Germany and Serbo-Croats in Northeastern Balkans through the Serbs have all but some converted to Greek culture and the Croats continue to live under Illyrian Romance rule. The Swedes are much less into trade and as a direct result Kievan Rus never becomes a nation and is instead divided among many warring states with the most powerful in Kiev and Novgorod as well as the Finns never being conquered and instead forming their own Empire. In Central Europe, Great Morava expands across Czechia and Slovakia with the Poles divided among their previous tribal territories, Polonia, Vistula, Mazovia, Galicia, and Pozen. The Prussians and Balts are never subjugated by Germans and survive as independent states and finally in the British Isles.  The previous Danish lands and Sasson kingdom to the south are in constant conflict in who to control the Isles. The Celts with Sassonia and Danelaw thrive along the Western Coast with the Picts surviving in the North. Khazar and Georgia are also large and unified nations with the Khazars practicing Judaism.

HaLoGuY007,USA,,"Here is the prospectus of a paper I wrote a few years ago, you could probably provide an update:

Determinants of Foreign Policy in Putin's Russia - NATO and the European Union

In this paper, the foreign policy formulated under Putin's regime will be analyzed by looking at how external factors and influences affect Putin's conception of he world outside of Russia. While American global hegemony is obviously a significant factor in Putin's long-term formulation of foreign policy, in reality the most pressing issues and factors determining Russia's identity in international relations are the presence of the European Union and NATO on its immediate borders. Only the most up-to-date sources will be consulted in this paper, as the current intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea by Russia, along with the ensuing EU sanctions, are crucial for the validation (or reconsideration) of current scholarship on Russian foreign policy determination.
	
Putin's strong desire to form Russia into a new global power that can balance against the interests of global and regional blocs such as NATO and the EU is an important part of Russian foreign policy, and this factor will definitely be examined. The role of NATO expansion in particular will be considered as a major driving force in Russian foreign policy responses and push to create a new European security architecture. For instance, Russia's greater involvement both economically and diplomatically in Eastern Europe and Central Asia may be seen as direct outcomes of NATO eastward expansion. Russia's military involvement in Ukraine today is an extremely interesting development in Russian foreign policy evolution, and this paper will attempt to determine the degree to which EU and NATO pressure influenced Putin's decision to support pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists. While the influence of the United States of America, particularly in its relations with the EU and leading role in NATO, will be noted, the focus in this paper will principally be the organizations themselves and their European character.",True,0,1517633180,,False,0,dtnvzye,False,t3_7uwtlu,t3_7uwtlu,/r/foreignpolicy/comments/7uwtlu/essay/dtnvzye/,1518881538,1,False,foreignpolicy,t5_2qmlq,public,

Eu não estou focando meus argumentos na questão da dor. Não o fiz em nenhum momento, mesmo você tendo entendido isto.
Então vou tentar desenhar:

1) Comparar o feto com um ser vivo e pensante é no mínimo desonesto. **Não** há evidências de que fetos tem uma percepção de seu entorno, pensam e/ou sentem(No sentido de sentimentos, e não físico). Hoje, definimos o ser humano como um ser pensante, um organismo vivo. Um feto não só não tem todas as características supracitadas (Pensar, sentir, perceber), como talvez nunca tenha tido. Se o feto **não** tem o SNC e está adormecido por toda sua existência, que diferença há entre ele e uma máquina com órgãos artificiais semi formados?

2) Se no caso de Phineas Cage, ele já era descrito como ""não sendo mais ele mesmo"", ""sendo outra pessoa"" etc, e ""só"" sofreu danos no seu lobo frontal. Como vamos argumentar que um ser sem o SNC totalmente formado é alguém? Creio que para responder isto, antes deveríamos conseguir responder o que forma um indivíduo.

3) Enquanto **não** há evidências de que um feto é mais ser vivo que um parasita (E de que é errado matar parasitas), dizer que é moral e/ou eticamente eliminá-lo é afirmar uma norma partindo do pressuposto de uma suposição.

4) Agora vamos tocar bem de leve na questão do sentir dor, só para abranger o máximo de âmbitos possível. Enquanto em uma guerra, eutanásia ou até mesmo na pena de morte, faz-se necessário regras para tentar garantir a ausência ou minimização da dor, por que explicitamente no caso da eliminação de um feto tal fato torna-se irrelevante de forma incontestável?

SoleWanderer,lgbt,POLSKA BĘDZIE SOCJALISTYCZNA ALBO WCALE JEJ NIE BĘDZIE,"Wichry nie dadzą rady rodzinie

„Ślub po polsku” przez wielu Polaków uznany został za film antypolski, choć – wypada podejrzewać – wielu z nich nie dostrzegłoby antygreckich akcentów w „Greku Zorbie”, w którym społeczność zaszczuwa niepasującą do niej kobietę, czy antywłoskich choćby w „Utalentowanym panu Ripleyu” – tam prosta włoska dziewczyna zachodzi w ciążę z Amerykaninem, a jako że nie może/nie chce jej usunąć i boi się reakcji tradycyjnej społeczności, popełnia samobójstwo. Theresa Connelly, reżyserka „Ślubu po polsku”, pochodzi ze środowiska Polaków i środowisko to w filmie przerysowała.

Polacy zresztą, jak wszystkie inne narody, sami lubią oglądać filmy o stereotypach, śmiać się z innych, bo to od zawsze jest wdzięczny temat do robienia sobie jaj. Czasem nie mają do końca świadomości, że śmieją się z siebie samych: weźmy takiego „Borata”, na którego w Polsce walono drzwiami i oknami, a nie rozumiano, że Kazachstan, ojczyzna Borata, z amerykańskiego punktu widzenia leży również w Polsce, jest to bowiem część ogólnowschodniego stereotypu.

Film „Ślub po polsku” to ogólny obraz peryferyjnego społeczeństwa, które akurat przybrało polskie oblicze. Żeby taki stereotyp się zmienił, potrzeba jest – cóż poradzić – dołączenia do „centrum”, do klubu państw, społeczeństw uważanych za „cywilizowane”. Od czasu irlandzkiego sukcesu gospodarczego o Irlandczykach się takie obrazki pokazuje coraz rzadziej.

Poza tym cóż, trudno – jeśli pozwolić sobie na odrobinę ironii – nie zauważyć, że filmy takie jak „Ślub po polsku” nie robią nic innego, jak tylko promują tradycyjne, rodzinne wartości. Rodzina jest duża i nie wywracają jej życiowe wichry, zasady są twarde, a każdy zna swoją rolę: kobiety są kobiece i zajmują się „kobiecymi sprawami”, a mężczyźni – męscy.

I szczerze mówiąc, dziwi naiwność prawicowców, którym się wydaje, że jeśli na przykład Polska w końcu wstanie już z tych słynnych kolan i – jak chciałby premier Morawiecki – elektrycznym samochodem (jestem ostatnim, który by ten pomysł wyśmiewał, zaznaczam) wjedzie z europejskich peryferiów do europejskiego centrum, jakimś cudem pozostanie prowincjonalnie konserwatywna i nadal będzie chciała „chrystianizować Europę”.

Nie pozostanie i nie będzie.

Bo komuniści nienawidzą Polaków?

Jakiś czas temu, również w Polsce, wydano książkę historyka jednego z amerykańskich uniwersytetów, prof. M.B.B. Biskupskiego, który pisał wprost o „antypolskim spisku w Hollywood” w czasie II wojny i po niej.

Według Biskupskiego żydowscy producenci filmowi i reżyserzy nie przepadali za Polską, w której miały miejsce antysemickie ekscesy, a Hollywood, tradycyjnie „lewacki”, sprzyjał ZSRR do tego stopnia, że stawiająca się Moskwie Polska była przedstawiana w negatywnym świetle.

Można się zastanawiać, czy to właśnie Polska, a nie proradzieckie sympatie Hollywoodu wspierane w czasie wojny przez rację stanu, która kazała formować proradziecko amerykańskie nastroje w czasie wojny, stała w samym środku problemu. Zresztą sam autor książki (którą wbrew jego woli opatrzono w polskim wydaniu wstępem skrajnie prawicowego publicysty Stanisława Michałkiewicza) w wywiadzie dla „Polityki” zwracał uwagę na złożony kontekst problemu. „Polscy emigranci stosunkowo późno zaczęli docierać do USA. Na większą skalę dopiero gdzieś na początku XX w. (…). W przeciwieństwie do Polaków uciekinierzy z Europy Zachodniej zdążyli się już zadomowić, stworzyć silne lobby, grupy interesów, przyjąć obywatelstwo amerykańskie. Polacy się izolowali i zajmowali bardzo niskie miejsce w strukturze amerykańskiego społeczeństwa. Nie wnieśli praktycznie żadnego wkładu w amerykańską kulturę popularną” – mówił.

Poza tym zauważał: „Administracja prezydenta Roosevelta całkowicie ignorowała polski punkt widzenia na II wojnę światową, ponieważ zależało jej na podtrzymaniu dobrych stosunków ze Związkiem Radzieckim. Polacy z ich traumą 17 września, Katyniem, donosami o sowieckiej okupacji bardzo im to utrudniali”.

Nawet jeśli profesor Biskupski nie przesadza (bo tych antypolskich filmów było, po pierwsze, niewiele, a po drugie, np. wymieniany przez niego jako przykład polakożerstwa film „Być albo nie być” Ernsta Lubitscha pokazuje Polaków również w dobrym świetle, a przedwojenna Warszawa to kwitnąca metropolia), to czasy te już minęły, choć peryferyjny wizerunek Polaków oczywiście pozostał. Rzecz w tym, że nie jest – w porównaniu z innymi, skądinąd o wiele częściej portretowanymi etnosami – wyjątkowo źle traktowany. Ot, peryferyjna średnia.

Można oczywiście zwracać uwagę na każdego pijanego, bijącego żonę Polaka w amerykańskim filmie, ale wtedy będzie się widziało to, co chce się zobaczyć, a trudno na przykład dowiedzieć się w Polsce o całej masie Polonusów, którzy od dawna w amerykańskiej popkulturze rzeźbią wcale nie taki potworny wizerunek Polaka.

Kowalski, Bukowski, Pulaski

Jedna z kultowych postaci amerykańskiego kina, główny bohater „Znikającego punktu”, nazywał się Kowalski, a jeden z głównych bohaterów „Hair” – Bukowski. Polskiego pochodzenia była detektyw V.I. Warshawski z Chicago i w ogóle wizerunek chicagowskiego polskiego copa jest dość popularny, mniej więcej tak jak wizerunek gliny irlandzkiego czy włoskiego w Nowym Jorku (ostatnio przypomniany w „Sense 8” Wachowskich). Genialny agent CIA, Chuck z serialu o takim właśnie tytule, nosi nazwisko Bartowski. W latach 70. bardzo popularny był wyrafinowany pod każdym względem i mocno wyelegantowany polsko-amerykański detektyw o nazwisku zapisywanym „Banacek”, a czytanym „Banaczek”, który na każdą okoliczność miał jakieś polskie rzekomo przysłowie.

Polskość tych przysłów była oczywiście równie prawdziwa jak zupa z krwi w „Polskim weselu” czy akcent Jacka Blacka w „Królu polki” („Synu, możesz przeczytać wszystkie książki w bibliotece, ale ser i tak zaśmierdnie się po czterech dniach” itd.).

W „Star Treku” ważną postacią była komandorka Katherine Pulaski. Można się kłócić o to, czy postacie z filmu braci Cohen „Big Lebowski” są godne miana Polaków, czy nie (ja osobiście czuję do nich bardzo dużo sympatii), ale wdarły się już na stałe w światową popkulturę (w tym miejscu warto dodać, że to właśnie Cohenowie cudownie wyśmiali komunistyczne sympatie hollywoodzkich gwiazd w latach 50. w filmie „Ave Cezar”). Podobnie jak pingwin z „Madagaskaru” o nazwisku Kowalsky.

Więc jest różnie. Polakiem jest dość pochmurny i paskudnego charakteru właściciel knajpy w „Simpsonach”, ale i Mickey Rourke w „Roku smoka”, który mówił: „Nie przekupisz mnie, jestem Polakiem, nie Włochem”, co jest dość zabawne w kontekście pytania zadanego przez „Króla polki” inspektorowi skarbowemu: „W Polsce załatwiamy takie sprawy łapówkami, a jak u was?”.

Polacy, obawiam się, znów nie są wyjątkowi. Są traktowani tak samo jak inni: raz tak, raz siak.

Na pieszczoty trzeba zasłużyć

Można też się zastanowić, jak sami chcemy być traktowani. Czy na przykład jak inne mniejszości chcemy roztoczenia nad nami parasola ochronnego politycznej poprawności (a przecież takiej właśnie poprawności często sprzeciwiają się polscy prawicowcy), choć w jej ramach jest się traktowanym trochę nie do końca serio.

Trochę, cóż poradzić, jak dziecko. Bo co innego zrozumienie dla problemów wynikających z sytuacji społecznej, cywilizacyjnej czy ekonomicznej, a co innego przemilczanie ich, „bo się obrażą”.

A jeśli chcemy, by nam publicznie robiono w kinie wyłącznie dobrze, no cóż – jak to mówił jeden z bardzo polskich bohaterów – na pieszczoty trzeba zasłużyć.

thermitethrowaway,,/g/entooman,"Back in the early noughties I was the one man IT department in a medium sized maintenance company. There was a department which was notoriously unhappy, because the of it boss was an absolute arsehole. He was a big fucker but still bullied the shit out of his female staff and anyone else he thought he could get away with it. Somehow, despite being a human sleaze and bearing a physical resemblance to a certain well known meme-frog he was married with two kids.

Anyway the EU had a ruling that companies could be sued if workers saw ""distressing porn"" (actually any porn you claim to be distressed by) on company computers. Me and many of my friends in IT suddenly had the most awesome job in the world: the company wide porn scan.

I went round every single machine, and had to search for images, copying onto a USB stick (in case of legal comeback) and removing any porn ones, whilst keeping a discrete second copy of any of the really good ones for personal research later.

Eventually, the one day in this golden age I dreaded arrived: I had to porn search the sleazebag's machine, and I deliberately waited until he was out the office so he would bother me, and if I found anything illegal I could notify the police. The latter was a concern,  I was not alone in expecting to find some horrible stuff on there. I ran the batch script to list the images, then started digging.  Lots of stuff in his internet history and downloaded with very porn-site looking filenames. Holy crap, it begins.

With a heavy heart I open the first image. Then another. Then another. To my shock ""every single one* was gay porn. More dicks than a homosexual convention for people called Richard. Oh frumptious day!!!!!! I took a copy carefully labelled with the asset number of the machine and the Mr Sleazebag's name.

Fast forward few days and he's back from his trip. He wants his department to get priority treatment, so he starts his usual bullying tactics. So I said ""I'd love to, but I did that porn scan on your computer last week, and I have a copy of all the files from you machine"".

It was mostly places with nearly no people affluence. (Which makes me wonder if it’s because these entities don’t “like” crowded places or if it’s just difficult to sense them when there are other living beings around, with their energy and vibrations.) Here in Europe I’d often hear or feel something following me when I go for walks in forests or rivers, either behind me or in the trees right next to me, when I started noticing it I thought it was birds or something, and sometimes it definitely is, but some other times it definitely isn’t haha I mean there’s no way a bird or any other critter is walking behind me and making so much noise too. Once when I was in Thailand and walking around at night in a area with wrecked houses and a small temple, at some point it was clear someone was following us. It didn’t sound exactly like a person, the steps were really light and a bit faster than ours. It just started out of nowhere.It was just trees and wrecked/abandoned houses, my friend knew the place and told me it was completely normal since the area had some intense spirit activity. (She’s kind of a medium. I’m quite familiar with the unseen too, but she has total control over her ability and she’s extremely sensitive to these things.) At some point it just stopped just as it started, as if something just appeared somewhere behind us and followed us for a bit then just disappeared. Something similar happened when we were walking along a water channel during sunset, it was mostly forest all around and there were lots of blooming trees, it was quite dark, we couldn’t really make out each other’s facial traits anymore, at some point it looked and felt as if other entities were walking around us, it was something magical haha.

woodywooder,,,"&gt; the most probable possibility is a ""war"" in the West Bank. 

I agree it is a distinct, not unlikely possibility. Hence my point on how much blood it will take to get there.

&gt; And most of the indigenous people killed, expelled or fleeing the Israeli ""anti-terrorist operation"".

I am not sure. Despite the evidence of the multiple Gaza massacres, I think you are overplaying the ability of people in general and the Israelis in particular to carry out the atrocities necessary to implement this. These will be genocidal in scale and will not be possible to do from the air or from afar. The perpetrators will need to look into the eyes of the people they are murdering, a-la the Naqba and Nakhsa. It will also be well documented and they will have no way to prevent it from being visible both to the Israelis and the world in real time. There will also likely to be significant armed Palestinian resistance.

The cracks in Israeli society while currently not very significant, will accelerate massively and will, with a high level of probability, create a chasm that only outright fascism would be able to handle. Their propagandist can say they are the most moral etc. to their hearts content, but the actual execution of these policies will not be limited to pilots, commandos and artillery. It will take most of the Israeli ground forces, including many people that are not SS personalities.

I also think you are downplaying the international reaction, which will also be extreme—both grassroots and official—especially in Europe and the Middle East, to the extent that they could destabilise regimes (e.g., Jordan). Other reactions could include intervention on the ground — humanitarian or even military. The latter is less likely, but would the Israelis be willing to risk it? Would the Americans be willing to risk a war with Russia or Iran to defend Israeli atrocities?

More significantly, would the Israeli establishment be willing to risk annihilation of the state as a distinct if low probability outcome even for the benefit of a Palestine without Palestinians?

The current global balance of forces is rapidly shifting against Israel and its main ally—the US—in favour of China and Russia. I think you are underestimating the affect this already has. While I do not think China or Russia will be motivated to help the Palestinians out of humanitarian concern, they may do so as a way to replace the US as the main imperial power in the Middle East. This replacement, BTW, is already in progress, as evidenced by the latest news from Syria.

&gt; Reading the comments of Israeli newspapers is enough to understand their motivation.

I am familiar *ad nauseam* (literally, since it is sickening) with the internal Israeli discourse.

&gt; recently we offer a very nice gruyere

What do you mean ""gruyere""?

&gt; serves to prove to themselves and the world

Themselves sure. The world, not so much. We already see this happening with the increased popularity of JVP, the fact that the Jewish communities are far less supportive of Israel and the fact that public opinion is shifting against Israel in most places.

All that being said, I must admit that the scenario you depict, or an attempt to carry it out, is a real possibility. For the current Israeli mainstream and certainly for the Israeli more extreme Right, near-genocide or actual genocide is not beyond their willingness to consider or execute.

Turning up for communion wearing a Russian hat with Hammer and Sickle decal might be a bad move, but short of  that:

I think it's important to look at what is meant by ""Communism"", since it's a fairly broad term.

Bearing in mind that Pius XII (based in Rome) issued his decree, at a time when Europe in particular was being threatened by a very particular form of Marxist-totalitarian ""Communism"".

And bearing in mind, that most Catholic parties in Europe have traditionally supported socio-economic policies which might be described as ""communist"", by some US standards. The Social Justice doctrines of the church, as detailed in the Catechism [ccc 1928-1948] are a good guide.

So, I think it's entirely possible to support some ""socialist"" socio-economic aims, but you'd have to be careful not to support any organizations/aims which directly oppose Church doctrine, and the institution of the Church herself.

The War on Terror is a military campaign launched by the Bush administration in response to the al-Qaida 9/11 terrorist attacks. The War on Terror includes the Afghanistan War and the War in Iraq. It added $2 trillion to the debt as of the FY 2018 budget. Who appropriates these funds? Congress. Who declared the war on terror? President George Bush  signed a joint resolution established the campaign that included the Afghanistan War and War in Iraq: 
https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm

The first year we began appropriations for this war was in FY 2001.
FY 2001 – $31 billion: Congress appropriated $22.9 billion in emergency funding for the War in Afghanistan. The United States attacked the Taliban for hiding al-Qaida's leader, Osama bin Laden. The Taliban lost power in December 2001. Hamid Karzai became interim administration head. That same month, ground troops pursued bin Laden into the Afghan foothills. He escaped to Pakistan on December 16, 2001.

Every year since FY 2001 we have had appropriations for operations in this war.

FY 2017 – $80.3 billion: The DoD requested $58.8 billion for Operation Freedom Sentinel in Afghanistan, Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and the Levant, increased European support and counterterrorism. President Trump requested that Congress add another $24.9 billion for the DoD and $5.1 billion for OCO to fight the Islamic State group. (Source: ""FY 2017 Amendment,"" OMB, March 16, 2017. DoD 2017 OCO Amendment.)

I agree that your war on concepts is stupid and is a loophole for funding and getting away with Congress having to declare war each time we think of a new operation.  We are at war though.  A never ending war because we have the blanket sentiment of fighting terror.  That goes back to my initial statement of the national defense medal.

&gt; I think it's way more important for the UK to strike a good deal with the EU, than vice versa. 

Why? It is in both parties interests to secure a good deal. The EU economy is big, but it isn't big enough that the second largest economy leaving wouldn't cause a mess. They won't cut off their nose to spite their face. They need a good deal too.

&gt;A hard Brexit will also create a hard border in Ireland, and that's something all parts wants to avoid.

This isn't necessarily true. 

&gt;Re: all this thing about controlling immigration... The UK was perfectly able, as a EU member, to put up systems to control/limit long-term immigration, even indirect means, like the possibility to open bank accounts only if you were a student/worker with a contract, or similar things.

This isn't true. David Cameron pledged to reduce immigration immensely, and it didn't happen because it couldn't be done. Do you honestly think those indirect checks were doing a good enough job at giving the government the power to set immigration levels? In most countries that control their immigration, they can lay out how many immigrants they want down to the single person, UK cannot do that. Hundreds of thousands of low-wage earners flood your country and compete for jobs with the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid for wages that seem unfair to most UK workers. 

&gt;The sky will not fall, but the country will very likely be worse off, as the latest data and reports (including Gov data) show. For what, in the end?

People said this when the UK did not join the Euro. It was a flawed assumption then, as I am sure many of the predictions about a post-EU UK are flawed now too. The EU is a horrendously complex bureaucratic entity with little to no democratic accountability. It's constant ability to overstep the mandate it never received has provoked nationalist sentiment in just about every country across Europe. Do you really think the UK is going to be the last country to leave the Union? I wouldn't count on it. Democracy depends on accountability, and there is no accountability for a super-state in a foreign country.

Quite honestly I think you all have been brainwashed into thinking the EU is fundamentally necessary, and that your countries are too small to be sovereign. As I pointed out, Canada, my country, is much smaller in population and economic size than the UK. Yet, we seem to manage just fine (with higher GDP growth I might add) than the UK does. People in this thread tried to make the argument that the UK is more integrated with Europe than Canada is with the US, but this isn't true. Despite a hard, real border along the 49th parallel, the Canadian economy grows just fine. We get to control our borders too, and our final court of appeal is in Ottawa.

You know, it's funny, I'm not sure how much you know about Canadian history, if anything at all. However, when we made the path from being a colony to a Dominion to a fully sovereign country, do you know what the final step was? Removing the right of the Parliament of Canada to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. That is, this constitutional (the 1931 Statute of Westminster) act removed the right of a foreign court to be our final word. In this moment Canada was considered to have become fully sovereign from the UK.

Why is this important? In this context the status of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as Canada's final court of appeal effectively made Canada a vassal, or a colony of the UK. Only after patriating that institution to Ottawa were we considered fully sovereign. A parallel can be drawn in the UK. Whilst the UK's final court of appeal remains the European court of Justice, the UK is not a sovereign nation. Full stop. I find this incredibly sad. I also find it mind boggling that so many in the UK do not care about their sovereign status.

I could go on, but I think you get the point.

cepseudoestdejapris,Zcoree,Corée du Sud,"De l'autre côté de la pièce, Croquette me fixait, menaçant, depuis dix minutes. Moi, j'étais assis à mon bureau, essayant de trouver l'inspiration pour mon prochain article quand je remarquai l'oeil perçant qui me dévisageait.

Il avait changé d'attitude à mon égard sans que je n'en connaisse la raison. Ses griffes avaient laissé des traces sur mes mains, le long de mes avant-bras et sur mes chevilles, aussi je m'approchais maintenant de lui avec une précaution qui, autrefois, était superflue. Depuis que Croquette m'avait, dans une attaque sauvage, lacéré l'auriculaire, j'avais retenu ma leçon.

"" - Avec un nom aussi ridicule, c'est normal qu'il te déteste."" ma petite amie plaisantait. C'était ironique venant de quelqu'un dont le nom était Appoline. Elle ne détestait pas ses parents pour autant.

Appoline ne prenait jamais rien au sérieux, surtout quand la situation ne la concernait pas. En revanche, elle avait beaucoup plus de mal à prendre du recul quand une autre fille portait le même haut H&amp;M qu'elle à une soirée, ou qu'elle ratait le bus le matin. Un ami se faisait voler son portable ? Tant mieux, il pourrait upgrader et se procurer le nouvel Iphone. Le voleur lui avait fait une faveur en lui subtilisant son vieux 5s dégueulasse. Une collègue pleurait la perte de sa mère ? Au moins, maintenant elle pourrait peut-être enfin passer à autre chose, les cernes causées par les visites tardives à l'hôpital lui donnaient une mine épouvantable. Mais si le serveur se trompait et lui apportait une salade niçoise au lieu de la salade César qu'elle avait commandé, il aurait été impossible de dédramatiser et la scène qu'elle aurait provoqué nous obligerait à quitter le restaurant. C'est comme ça, je m'y étais habitué. 

"" - Qu'est ce qu'il y a, Croquette ?"". Pas de réponse. 

J'avais trouvé Croquette deux ans plus tôt dans une petite ruelle près du bureau. Il était gelé et frissonnant et j'avais décidé de de le recueillir. Ce qui ne manqua pas de surprendre mes amis; je n'avais jamais eu d'affection particulière envers les animaux et je n'avais jamais éprouvé le besoin de posséder un animal de compagnie. Quand mes petits camarades de classe suppliaient leurs parents de leur offrir un chiot, je demandais aux miens de me faire un petit frère, ou à la rigueur une petite soeur. Je grandis sans chiot, ni frère, ni soeur.

Le vétérinaire m'avait expliqué que Croquette avait peut-être été la victime d'autres chats sauvages et qu'ils étaient peut-être les responsables de la perte de son oeil et de ses nombreuses cicatrices. Peut-être. ""Mais si vous voulez mon avis"", m'avait dit le vétérinaire, ""L'hypothèse la plus probable, c'est qu'il s'est enfui d'un maitre abusif. Ou que ce tordu l'a abandonné après s'être amusé. C'est plus courant que l'on ne pense, malheureusement."" Il m'avait souhaité bonne chance, après un traumatisme causé par les humains les animaux avaient tendance à beaucoup se méfier, il lui faudrait du temps avant de se familiariser.

Il avait tort. Entre Croquette et moi, c'était le coup de foudre. C'était lui qui me réveillait le matin quand il venait se blottir contre moi. Quand je travaillais, il se posait sur mes genoux et son ronronnement doux et régulier m'apaisait et m'aidait à me concentrer. Il me suivait partout dans l'appartement et entendre ses petits miaulements plaintifs au moment où je devais partir travailler me brisait le coeur. Quand je rentrais, il sautait du canapé et se ruait vers moi pour se frotter à mes chevilles. Moi, je lui caressais le pelage et tous les soucis, toutes les problèmes que j'avais rencontré pendant la journée, je les oubliais instantanément.

Mes amis adoraient Croquette et ils avaient remarqué une nette différence dans mon comportement; ils me trouvaient plus relaxé, plus souriant, plus heureux. C'était peut-être pour ça que j'avais attiré Appoline.

Marco en particulier adorait Croquette et se faisait un plaisir de jouer avec lui quand il venait passer l'après-midi à la maison. Il avait arrêté de venir depuis que Appoline était là. C'est normal, on perd de vue les amis lorsqu'on s'implique dans une relation amoureuse. En tout cas c'est ce qu'elle m'avait dit. Mais en y réfléchissant bien, c'était elle qui m'avait conseillé, lourdement conseillé, de réduire le temps passé avec ces ""personnes qui me tiraient vers le bas"". Et, le temps passant, je ne fréquentais plus que ses amis à elle. Et uniquement des hommes. Elle ne supportait pas que je parle à d'autres filles, et les rares fois où j'avais eu le malheur de regarder une autre dans la rue, il s'ensuivait une crise aux dimensions dramatiques. J'avais toujours apprécié être entouré de femmes (des relations purement amicales, j'étais loin d'être un Don Juan) et j'avais eu beau lui expliquer qu'elle était la seule pour moi et que mes amies n'étaient véritablement que ça, j'avais finalement dû couper les ponts. Pour elle.

Bien sur, elle haïssait Croquette. Mais malgré ses demandes, puis ses exigences, et enfin un ultimatum, elle n'avait pas réussi à me séparer de lui. Pour une fois, j'avais tenu bon et elle avait été forcée d'abandonner. Elle décidait simplement d'ignorer sa présence et cela semblait réciproque. Pourtant, un jour où elle se dirigeait vers la cuisine, Croquette lui coupa innocemment la route, se dirigeant lui vers sa litière. Elle lui asséna un grand de coup de pied qui l'envoya contre le mur. Ma colère avait été terrible: j'avais vu la scène du coin de l'oeil, distraitement, mais il n'y avait aucun doute pour moi, le geste avait été volontaire. Elle se mit à pleurer à chaudes larmes, me promettant qu'elle ne l'avait pas fait exprès, et me rendant compte que j'avais perdu mon sang-froid, je la pris dans mes bras pour la réconforter. Quant à Croquette, il avait déjà commencé depuis quelques temps à avoir l'attitude hostile à laquelle, malgré moi, je m'habituerai; je m'approchai de lui, m'assurant qu'il aillait bien, et je le laissai vaquer à ses occupations.

Comme j'avais beaucoup de mal à me concentrer, je me levai et je me dirigeai vers la cuisine pour me faire un sandwich. Autrefois, Croquette m'aurait suivi pour tenter de m'extorquer un morceau de jambon, mais il resta immobile, suivant néanmoins ma trajectoire d'un oeil mauvais. J'entendis des pas résonner dans le couloir, Appoline était rentrée du travail.

"" - Tu te fais un sandwich à cette heure-ci ?"" dit-elle, d'un air visiblement réprobateur.

"" - Bonjour, tu as passé une bonne journée ?"" dis-je ironiquement.

"" - Si tu passes ta journée à manger de la merde, tu vas rien pouvoir manger ce soir au diner.""

"" - Peut-être que je devrais rester à la maison ce soir. Je sais déjà comment ça va se passer, tu vas rester avec tes amis qui vont m'ignorer, et moi je vais devoir tenir compagnie au 'plan cul de la semaine' de Léa.""

"" - Ne parle pas comme ça de mes amis. Et tu vas venir ce soir, point final.""

J'étais irrité. Combien de fois nos conversations s'étaient terminées ainsi ? Elle décidait et elle ordonnait et elle avait le dernier mot et...Pas ce soir, décidai-je.

"" - Ce soir, je reste à la maison et tant pis si ça te déplait. Je peux faire mes propres choix de temps en temps, tu sais ?""

Elle poussa un rire moqueur. Sans elle, je n'étais rien, me lança-t-elle. J'étais un loser qui passait ses week-ends à fumer avec Marco ou à faire la tournée des bars et elle m'avait transformé en quelqu'un d'adulte, de responsable.

La réponse qui me vint aux lèvres, jusqu'à maintenant, je n'avais jamais osé y penser et encore moins la dire à haute voix.

"" - Je ne viens pas ce soir."" commençai-je, ""et je pense qu'on devrait arrêter de se voir.""

Ce soir-là, comme je l'avais décidé, je n'allai pas au diner. Elle non plus. Après plusieurs heures de disputes, de larmes de crocodiles, d'insultes, et enfin d'une confession (elle m'avoua qu'elle couchait depuis plusieurs semaines avec Nicolas, son prétendu meilleur ami avec qui il ne se passerait jamais rien) qui me surprit mais me blessa moins que je ne l'aurais imaginé, elle accepta la réalité et décida de sortir en claquant la porte. Accepter était un grand mot, elle n'avait pas manqué de casser plusieurs de mes affaires et de me promettre que je regretterai amèrement ma décision.

Épuisé, je tombai sur le canapé et poussai un grand soupir. Je me sentais vide, mais quelque part j'étais soulagé. La tête renversée en arrière, je fixais le plafond, quand je sentis une masse se jeter agilement sur mes genoux.

thisisasadpost,,,"&gt; I hear this shit alot from Europeans, at this point I'm starting to wonder if its a language thing.

At least for German that is true. 

“Government” is usually translated as “Regierung” in German, but “Regierung” really only means the chancellor, cabinet level ministers and their immediate staff. 

The broader meaning of “government” as “the entirety of all the state apparatus” is usually lost in translations to German. 

&gt; Germany's history isn't even a century old.

Well, that’s if you define history as “existence of the current state representing the nation of Germany”. 

Most Germans wouldn’t place that much importance to the inception of our current constitution - just like the French have gone through about a dozen constitutions in the last 200 years doesn’t mean “French history only started in 1958 when they established the 5th republic”. 

&gt; I cannot for the life of me fathom the faith Germans have in their government.

Part of the issue and one of the arguments against government run healthcare in the states is size. The US is fucking massive. There's 323 million people living here. That's over 3x the size of Germany's population and 30x the size of Sweden's population. Obviously taxpayer money is used to fund government run healthcare systems. This isn't that big of a deal in most European countries since population sizes aren't that large. The US has so many people scattered across so much land that you would have to raise taxes pretty significantly to adequately pay for such healthcare. There's a lot of people with a lot of medical needs and those needs range from minuscule to massive. You also have to take into account the amount of medical professionals currently working. Government funded healthcare takes more time than privately owned healthcare and if everyone started using government funded healthcare, wait times for medical attention would be dramatically longer than smaller European countries. Again, population size plays a big roll in how effective such things are. I personally don't really care whether the US adopts a system like Europe's.

PatrickRsGhost,,,"Language in general.  


Who were the first people who looked at a ball and said that object was called a ball?  


Who were the first people to decide the shapes and pen-strokes required for forming the letters of symbols for their language?  


Why are there different languages in different countries; if people migrated from one area to another over time, how and why did the language change?  For example, when the Norse Vikings conquered most of Europe, how is it that their native language evolved into the modern European languages we know today?  More to the point, how is it that in a collective of connected countries like in Europe, Asia, or even the Americas, each one has their own language?  And even within a single county, you have the different dialects.  In the United States, you have regional dialects.  It's not just ""Northern"" or ""Southern"" or ""Midwest"".  You have so many different sub-dialects within each region.  The pitch and tone are different, as are the pronunciation or even terminology.  You call it a hoagie, I call it a sub.


Who decided how grammar works in each language?  Who created the terms ""nouns"", ""verbs"", ""adjectives"", ""adverbs"", ""prepositions"", and ""conjunctions"", among other things?  Who decided how noun-verb agreement (conjugation) worked?  Or sentence structure?  Who was the first to call it a ""paragraph""?

This ideology seeks to destroy western, Eastern or any form of secular governance around the world replacing it with itself. They have funded and fostered the spread of this ideology right under the noses of the US government resulting in increased extremism around the world.

The relaxed period is during 1980s under Hu Yaobang. He is the #2 high rank official, first as Chairman from 1981 to 1982, then as General Secretary from 1982 to 1987. He was purged by other officials due to his policy, viewed as disaster. And his death (April 15, 1989) is direct trigger of Tienanmen Square protests and tragedy of 1989.


He visited Tibet and Xinjinag and proposed the reform.

quote from the above source: 
&gt;*Some of the 1980 reforms were implemented, but they were cut short by a series of riots in Lhasa that started in 1987. To Beijing hardliners, the riots indicated that too much freedom is a bad thing, and in 1987 Hu Yaobang was purged, partly for his recommendations regarding Tibet. By the spring of 1989 martial law had been declared in Tibet, and the Chinese concluded that relaxing restrictions on Tibetan culture and religion was tantamount to encouraging unrest. The two-pronged solution was quickly cut in half: Beijing would simply develop the economy, hoping that rising standards of living would defuse political tensions while building closer economic ties with the interior. This policy has been accelerated by the enormous investments of the 1990s.*

XinJiang's case is much worse due to the level of vilence (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR6jBDe1-io), who started, who is responsible deserver a new thread, but reality remind me of series of bombings during the Northern Ireland Troubles or recent incidents in Europe. Without stability, economical development is nothing. There are two Chinese official: the strongman Wang Zhen (ruled Xinjiang 1950s)， and not-so-hardliner Wang Lequan (ruled XinJiang 1994 until demotion shortly after July 2009  riots). In Han community in XinJiang, ""We want Wang Zhen, we don’t want Wang Lequan"" was a popular slogan.

blumeison,,,"Ich hatte den text schon für einen anderen beitrag vorbereitet, aber er passt genauso in den thread, also poste ich ihn hier:

Es wird echt ein Drama in ein paar Akten, was da in den nächsten Monaten / Jahren passieren wird.

Zuerst mal gesagt : Dem Schritt, Landbauer zu kicken, gebührt Respekt. Welches Türl da aber Strache damit aufgemacht hat, dessen Ausgang ist äußerst ungewiss.

Die blauen haben nämlich ein massives Dilemma das sich meiner Meinung aus 3 Fraktionen zusammensetzt:

Fraktion 1  (die rechtsextremen) :
Viele der Intellektuellen bei den Blauen kommen aus Burschenschaften oder aus Netzwerken die halt mit der Nazi-Ideologie sympathisieren. Ich will das jetzt auch gar nicht bewerten, ist halt so. Die Partei, vor allem die Bundes-Partei benötigt diese Mitglieder aber, weil jene aus Fraktion 2, einfach nicht fähig sind, eben jene höheren Positionen zu übernehmen, die derzeit zBspl. in der Regierung besetzt sind. Und sollte man dennoch jemanden aus Fraktion 2 dafür verwenden, so sind darunter die Kabinettsmitglieder jedenfalls jene, die zumindest Informell die Arbeit der Führungspositionen übernehmen. Ist aber sicher mehr die Ausnahme als die Regel


Fraktion 2 (die Primitiven) :
Das sind jene, die man mit ""Neger raus"", ""Moslem-mama"" und sonstigen tiefen Sprüchen geködert hat, um eine Basis zu schaffen. Darunter sind auch die Eso-Freunde, und Chemtrails-Aluhutträger dabei. Die können schon grundsätzlich mit der Nazi-Kultur sympathisieren, aber ich sehe hier eher die Motivation aus Rassismsus, Konservatismus entstehen. Möglicherweise auch Beobachter oder direkt betroffener Globalisierungsverlierer (""de oaschlächer da oben und in da eu mochn wos woin"")
Das ist meiner Meinung nach die Größte Gruppe innerhalb der FPÖ, sei es jetzt rein als Wähler, aber auch vertreten in den untersten politischen Ämtern (erklärt auch die regelmässigen ""Einzelfälle"" und Rülpser die man immer wieder über solche Leute liest)

Fraktion 3 (die Opportunisten) :

Das ist eher Vermutung und Bauchgefühl, und ich glaube dass das auch eine Mischung aus Fraktion 1 und 2 ist. Diese Leute gibt es im Prinzip in allen Parteien, und je nach Geschmack, haben diese Leute halt eine gewisse Affinität zur Ideologie die hinter der Partei steckt. Halt nicht auf Leben und Tod, bzw. nicht aus reinstem Prinzip.

So. Und jetzt die Erklärung zum Dilemma:

Fraktion 1 sind die kleinste Gruppe. Diese ist notwendig um die Partei auf Bundesebene zu führen, anders gehts nicht. Man sieht schon an der Auswahl der Persönlichkeiten der Regierung, dass hier die Luft massiv dünn ist, oder gibts eine bessere Erklärung dafür, dass das Außenministerium mit einer unparteiischen Person besetzt wird? Warum sitzen hinter den ersten Reihen soviele Burschenschafter die Informell vermutlich einen Riesen Einfluss auf die Vorderen haben?
Wenn jetzt aber die Führungsriege, konkret eigentlich am ehesten Strache + Kickl (reine Vermutung) jetzt beginnen zum ""sauber machen"", mit dem sicher für sie schmerzhaften Kick von Landbauer + auf mittelfristige Sicht der eingesetzten Historiker Kommission (was auch immer das dann sein soll), was könnte dann passieren? Weil eines muss bewusst sein, wenn man bei Fraktion 1 konsequent aussiebt, dann bleibt ganz ganz wenig über für eine Regierung bzw. eine ernst zu nehmende Bundespartei.

Also, ich kann mir 2 Szenarien vorstellen :

Szenario eins : Die Partei zerreissts wieder wie 2005-2006 unter Haider, mit vermutlich ähnlichen Konsequenzen. Die intellektuellen Deutschnationalisten werden sich das vermutlich nicht gefallen lassen. Wie das im Detail dann aussieht, keine Ahnung.

Szenario zwei: Das ganze Schauspiel was da die FPÖ jetzt liefert ist genau das : ein Schauspiel. Man lernt aus den Fehlern, die jetzt mit der Burschenschaft Germania passiert sind. Macht sich noch unangreifbarer, geht mit seiner Ideologie noch mehr ins Private, in den Untergrund, so dass genau das, was Kickl gesagt hat: ""Die rote Linie ist das STGB"" eben eingehalten wird. Sprich 3 Bier nur noch im Privaten, Rapid-Lieder mit erhobener Hand - Fotos nur mehr auf eigene Gefahr mit der Konsequenz, auszuscheiden, sollte es öffentlich werden. Die Rülpser aus Fraktion 2 wird man weiterhin überleben, da hier genug Nachwuchs da ist (Kickl-Jugend :D :D :D :D ) um nachzubesetzen. Dann wirds natürlich zach bzw. ist es ohnehin schon. Wenn nichts mehr nachzuweisen ist, dennoch eine politische Agenda, wie radikal die auch immer aussehen mag, durchgesetzt wird, dann gibts auch immer weniger Angriffsfläche, welche Art auch immer, sich dagegen zu wehren. Der Autistic-Screeching-Train hilft hier nämlich gar nichts. Erst nach großem Druck von vielen Seiten ist die Entscheidung für Landbauer gefallen. 


Ich persönlich, tendiere eher zu Szenario 2. Ich glaube dass mit Strache und Kickl (Hofer ist definitiv Fraktion 1, Strache und Kickl mehr Fraktion 3), das ganze schon so hingebogen wird, dass es nicht so arg scheppert. Mit etwas Pragmatismus, ein paar Bauernopfern, und vernünftigen internen Richtlinien wird es zu schaffen sein, ein Rebranding nach außen zu machen, dass aussieht, als hätt sich der Wolf im Schafpelz, dessen Hülle schon ordentlich zerissen ist, endlich seiner Innereien entledigt. Aber, um bei dem Gleichnis zu bleiben -&gt; der Schafpelz alleine is halt dann nix, was agieren oder sich bewegen kann, Wolf sein ist keine Option, also wird der Pelz mal ordentlich erneuert :P


Hab ich mir alles massivst aus den Fingern gezuzelt. Freue mich über jegliche Korrekturen, solangs nicht auf ein ""so ein bullshit"" rausläuft :P

The fool didn't realize that the 'insecure data' they were recording for making a fingerprint could be personal information Google should never have. 

So Google went public and exposed the fact that they have this data and asked the worldwide community for advice on what to do with it. There were US politicians trying to strong arm Google into giving them a copy of the data, ""We just want a look! Honest!"". Google told them to get a lawyer, and eventually destroyed the data after suggesting they willfully pay millions in fines that be used to build an organization that helps inform companies on this issue and provides them with guidance should they ever screw up in a similar way. 

No bull. They actually suggest their own punishment AFTER turning themselves in. Of course the EU heard about it and made them pay an additional €100,000!

The Anglican choral tradition is one of the great successes of English cultural diffusion, to rank with Association Football (soccer), cricket, and the works of William Shakespeare. It has a cultural heft way beyond its parochial and very specific origins, and it turns up in the oddest places. The most incongruous example must surely be the upmarket gloss that Thomas Tallis’s forty-part motet Spem in Alium lends to a down-and-dirty scene in the film Fifty Shades of Grey.


I’m often surprised by how far this music travels. The transposition of the Anglican sound world into the urban jungle of New York seemed rather miraculous the first time I walked into Saint Thomas Episcopal Church on Fifth Avenue to bathe in the glories of stained glass–inflected light and English-inflected harmonies. On another occasion, I was in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, for a concert, arriving just after a school shooting in next-door Jacksonville that had made me preternaturally alert to the cultural differences between the Old and the New Worlds. But it turned out that the concert was in St. Paul’s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. Our greenroom was the church vestry, and I felt strangely at home among the cassocks and surplices, The Oxford Book of Tudor Anthems (some nice Tallis there), and the familiar hardcovers of Hymns Ancient and Modern and The English Hymnal, the red and the green.


I grew up on the fringes of this Anglican culture, and I remain at one and the same time drawn to it and stoutly resistant. Resistant because in the mainstream classical world of opera and song in which I work, a church sound is often frowned upon whenever a hint of it (the withdrawal of vibrato from the voice, for example) is detected or imagined. Drawn, because from the ages of seven to twelve or thirteen I sang, una voce bianca as the Italians call it, in the humble precincts of St. Leonard’s, a parish church in Streatham, South London. Its glory days had been in the eighteenth century, the days of the so-called Streatham worthies, when the likes of Sir Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Edmund Burke, and Oliver Goldsmith—all friends of the wealthy brewer Henry Thrale—hung out in what was then a mere village. Samuel Johnson was a regular worshiper.


By the 1970s St. Leonard’s was part of the anonymous London sprawl, on the way down, and yet the church choir, under the leadership of an inspiring organist and choirmaster, Tom McLelland-Young, kept alive the flame of a musical tradition that—as Andrew Gant, in his history of English church music, O Sing unto the Lord, makes clear—can trace its roots back to late antiquity. With limited resources we performed the Passions of Johann Sebastian Bach (in truncated form) and anthems by Counter-Reformation masters such as the Italian Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and the Spaniard Tomás Luis de Victoria. But at the core of our repertoire (though I hesitate to use that rather professional word) was the glorious inheritance from the English Reformation and its immediate aftermath—Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, the exotically named Orlando Gibbons, John Blow, Henry Purcell—and the music that was created in an attempt to recreate that beauty of holiness: the Victorian and Edwardian anthem tradition of Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Herbert Howells, and many others.


Gant’s book is particularly fascinating for a former suburban choirboy like myself because it explains a lot of things that at the time seemed either rather mysterious or just to be taken for granted. Psalms, for example—sung by choir and congregation—seemed to occupy an inordinate amount of the morning service, and the junior members of the choir spent much of the sermon sniggering over the psalmist’s more recondite imagery, usually in psalms we never sang but found in the prayer book, and which we somehow conjured into a vague impropriety (“my mouth is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to the roof of my mouth” seemed unaccountably hilarious).


Psalm-singing was, as Gant makes clear, one of the major strands of post-Reformation church music in England. It was a vital part of congregational singing from the 1500s on, a totem of Protestant rectitude, and a site of struggle between populist instincts and clerical control. It had migrated from the evangelical movements of continental Europe and fit well into a political culture that celebrated English reform as a resurrection of the blessed biblical Israel: in 1560, Bishop John Jewel celebrated mass psalm-singing at Paul’s Cross in London and wrote that “you may now sometimes see…after the service, six thousand persons, old and young, of both sexes, all singing together and praising God”; Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army went into battle with psalms on their lips. But the songs that congregations loved to sing in church and that the clergy sought to control were metrical psalms (they stood, strictly speaking, outside the approved liturgy); they were rendered into rhyming English verse and sung as what we would nowadays call hymns. Gant gives the example of Psalm 84, “How pleasant is thy dwelling place,” married in Thomas Ravenscroft’s 1621 Psalter to a tune that in our own day is better known as “While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night” (which naughty choirboys inevitably garbled into “while shepherds washed their socks by night”).


The psalms we sang back in the 1970s, and which continue to be sung in Anglican or Episcopalian churches and cathedrals today, are something rather different from this metrical populism. Anglican or English chant—which dates back to the sixteenth century but didn’t triumph until the nineteenth—was a matter of matching the natural speech-rhythms of the psalm to the notes of a simple harmonized melody. It thus preserved the authorized translation of the psalm in question and created an echo of monastic chanting, although the tunes were far removed from the Gregorian austerity of medieval times. I seem to remember our leading the congregation in the singing of these psalms, but it’s a tricky business (it involves singing a lot of words to the same note, and changing at just the right moment) and nowadays left mostly to the choir alone.


The other crucial elements of English church music, and its twin glories, are hymn-singing and the anthem, which stand at the alternate poles of populism and elitism in religious practice. Hymns have been a feature of Christian worship almost from the very beginning, of course, as songs of praise and adoration of the Divinity. Lutheranism is deeply rooted in congregational hymn-singing; its most famous hymn, “Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott” (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God) is a sturdy embodiment in music and words of a movement built on Luther’s declaration Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders (Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise). Bach’s Passions are structured around the congregational singing of Lutheran hymns. Calvinism, the other main current of early Protestantism, was queasier about anything that was not the licensed word of God appearing in a church service (hence the nervousness about metrical psalms).

enmara23,player twentytwo,Willian,"&gt; The board isn't going anywhere, surely you must know this.

I'm not suggesting they move or be replaced, I'm suggesting that we'd be better off if they changed how they do things a little.

&gt; The fact that their policy has changed recently is because Roman wants it that way. So if you want real change then Roman is the one who has to go. At this point, having a manager who can at least work with them is probably best for the club.

That's fine, but Roman will have to know that he's creating the wrong incentives. He wants us to play youth yet he creates an environment that doesn't incentivise it.

Why would Conte play young players and help develop them when his job is on the line? No manager will. Bad incentives.

Frequently in transfer windows transfers are left til the last day or in Drinkwater and Zappacosta's case literally the last minutes.

It doesn't reek of professionalism or a well-oiled machine and Matt Law has said the board realises they could have done better during summer.

&gt; Are you seriously trying to downplay what they've achieved with so little resources compared to Juve? I haven't met anyone who's unimpressed by them.

Because they'll most likely have nothing to show for it. They're out of CL, even lost to Feyenoord and apart from one cup game (in a competition where they went on to lost against Atalanta) they've mostly lost to Juve. Remember, Conte has a winning record against Allegri, 5-3-1 I believe it is, a winning record against Pep and Jose too.

Sarri did nothing against City, even with Ghoulam in the side they were pretty competently dispatched with. He's the guy who looks up to Guardiola's style of football, he's a big fan of Pep. How are we going to best Pep Guardiola at playing like Pep Guardiola when we spend less as well?

They have poor resources on the bench with Ghoulam out but their first team is pretty stacked, even with that fully fit first team he didn't damage City in any meaningful way.

&gt; The same Liverpool that lost by 5 goals at the Etihad and only won by 1 at Anfield?

Lost by 5 goals because they went down to ten men against the best attacking team in the league.

&gt; That's all conjecture and guesswork and it was Conte who subbed in Willian instead of an actual striker, which was the turning point of the match.

Yes because Michy isn't good enough, he's always wanted a different kind of striker and the board left it til January to give him that. For every scrappy goal against Atletico Madrid or West Brom there's matches like Norwich or Crystal Palace where Michy wasn't a threat at all. Michy is great for sides like Marseille or Dortmund where it's set up for a poacher, we don't play that way. He was an Emanelo target if i remember correctly.

&gt; Yes, the board did not back Conte, you need not say this a hundred times but that has nothing to do with Sarri's capability.

Sarri doesn't speak a word of english and I'm pretty sure he's only coached in italy. He's going to be 60 soon as well. People criticise Conte for being shit in Europe yet Sarri's record isn't anywhere near as good.

TacomaJer,,,"Hi Glouns, 
Premièrement, ta blessure me semble sérieuse et du avoir faite très mal. Je peux ressentir un peu ta situation, car j'ai aussi fracturé sévèrement ma astragale (talus) en juin 2017. Je suis tombé d'environ 20 pieds en faisant de l'escalade intérieur quand j'ai manqué le matelas et tombé sur le béton. 
Je veux dire que je ne suis pas entrain de comparé nos blessures, ni de faire compétition de qui a la plus sévère. Je veux juste te dire que tu n'Est pas la seule à te sentir découragée, et j'aimerais te partager mon histoire et te donner un peu d'espoir, et peu être en trouver aussi en se tenant contact si nous avons des nouvelles positives. 
Donc, en juin c'est ca, je tombe. Je vais à l'urgence, l'aventure commence et je rencontre l'orthopédiste spécialisé en chevilles et me dit que ce n'est pas beau. Le pire qu'il a vu. Mon astragale était émiétté en plus d'une centaine de fragments, mon talon était cassé à plusieurs endroits sans compter le dommage aux tendons, ligaments, muscles etc. On m'opère, 8 vises et une plaque plus tard, il ont aussi du couper mon tibia afin de faire la chirurgie possible. Après 6 heures d'opérer, je me réveil et l'aventure de torture commence. 8 semaines plus tard je peux enfin baissé ma jambe vers le sol pour environ 1-2 heures. Graduellement ça devenu mieux, et j'ai pu marcher en béquilles sans poids dessus pour 4 mois. Ensuite 25% jusqu'au 5e mois, 50 jusqu'au 6e et finalement 100% depuis 3 semaines. Mon pied ne sera jamais pareille comme avant. Je fais du gym dans poids (cables et machines seulement) et je fais de la physiothérapie 2 fois par semaine avec des étirements et exercises à chaque jours quand je suis à la maison. Je suis infirmier à l'urgence de métier, mais je ne sais pas si je pourrai y retourner. Cependant, je travaille dans les bureaux des soins infirmiers pour le moment, assis à un bureau. j'ai eu AVN (Avascular necrosis) qui est la nécrose dans le dome de mon astragale, mais la progression à arrêté depuis je j'ai commencé à marcher sur mon pied. Je suis à haut risque d'arthrose, et que mon astragale collapse. 
Pour conclure, j'aimerais de te dire que rester positive, écouter ton chirurgien, peut-être t'informer pour des suppléments de collagène, acides aminées, bonne alimentation, éviter de fumer complètement (si c'est le cas), faire de la physio et les activités qu'il te demande de faire à la maison.
Tu es capable, je ne pensais jamais être capable, mais me voici. Je ne pense pas retourner à faire des triathlons, ski alpin, karaté, etc. mais je vais surement trouver des alternatifs.

Doesn't help that many high level streamer mids including scarra, shiphtur, and even faker himself agree she is too strong. She has 100% pick/ban in na lcs (18 bans) 84% in EU, and has been banned or picked in almost every game in lck where malz wasn't picked first. It's not like people are just spinning a wheel to decide what champ is annoying to play against. 

People don't like the sleep mechanic, and it makes sense. A strong, single target CC with a 2.2 second slow then a 2 second stun on a 8.4 second CD that gets reduced to 5.9 seconds if the spell lands and deals bonus true damage that doubles the next spell up to (440+80% ap) damage, which explodes into a zoning tool if missed and can be shot through terrain from really far away... sounds annoying just to type. Maybe not OP in the hands of silver/gold players, but obviously a powerful tool in pro hands (even with the increased average vision to help dodge her) and annoying at any level. And that's not even mentioning the possibility of free teleports, which seem to be fairly common since in multiple pro games and streams there have been instances of 2-3 dropping back to back. Really just getting one TP a game is probably too much... even ADCs are going unsealed spellbook to get their hands on TP right now because it's such a good laning tool.

She's not impossible to beat, or even play against. If your main champs are malz or highly mobile champs like ecco or LeBlanc, you might not even think she's a tough lane opponent... but then she can be 4 kills and 20 cs behind and sleep one squishy from range and chunk them out with pretty much no good counterplay besides flash.

WW1 was militarism-driven imperialism with tenuous alliances pitting nation against nation—a CHOICE each European nation made.

WW2 was a result of nationalism and revenge-minded “peace” (the US president wanted WW1 to end as “peace without victory,” but France demanded Germany be punished, so Britain went along with it), caused by European rivalries and self-interest—again, CHOICES made by each European nation, with collective impacts.

African Imperialism was multiple European nations colluding to strip the continent of its resources and “civilize” it’s people. EUROPEAN nations (plural), not just one or two.

&gt; Eugenics is the argument that one can improve the human race with breeding specific  and that certain genetics are superior. Saying that Black People are inherently less intelligent and less capable due to their genetic material isn't apart of that then you're not based in reality at most at least being intellectually dishonest.
&gt; 
&gt;  I'm not inherently better than a black person because my acenstors POSSIBLY developed a better brain due to inbreeding with a subhuman species. What does show an improvement in economic standing is education.

You still don't understand. Yes some genetics are ''superior'' some white people have ''superior'' genetics than other white people in some aspects (physical, cognitive, creative etc...) not everyone is ''superior'' in everything. Blacks, as a group, on some aspects, are ''physically superior'' to whites, thats the point, different groups have different attributes. This is why we need to look at people at the individual level. Also, Neanderthals aren't a subhuman species, they are simply a species that belongs to the Homo genus, just like sapiens are another species of the Homo genus.

&gt; The statement that ""White People are Opressors"" is validated by history, there was laws made specifically to oppress blacks. It's not because it's inherent to white people, we just thought dumb things like Blacks were genetically inferior. This is no where near the actual scientific consensus, and we moved on and learned more. One thing that us indisputable is that The US botched race relations, addressing how that happened and what permeates to today is how you ease racial tension. It wasn't just against Blacks, it was almost every immigrant group.
&gt; 
&gt; How can you seriously not see that arguing that Black People are genetically inferior with no option to improve increases racial tension?

Some white people have been oppressors historically, sure. A lot of white people have also been liberators. When Europe began its slave trade, Africa and the Middle East had been enslaving Africans for a long time. Some Europeans decided to join them and other Europeans realized that what these people (other Europeans, some Africans and some Middle Easterners) were doing was an abomination and so they fought and sacrificed their lives to end enslavement, not only in America, but also in Africa.

*''1861-1865 is the Civil War, and so we can see that cotton production collapsed after it. Now it’s hard to tell exactly due to annual fluctuations, but it seems that cotton production matched its pre-war peak around 1871, and went up from there. So yes, cotton could be produced without slaves. It shouldn’t be too hard to believe since most white southerners were farmers, and most of the farmers in the United States at the time were white, and produced a net food surplus.''*

* http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html

*In 1860 slaves were 12.67% of the US population, now while some whites gained from that sweet 12.61% profit off of his slaves, the average profit for investment in the economy at large was around ~8.5%. So we’re talking about a 4-5% higher profit that people who invested in slaves got compared to what they would have gotten if they invested elsewhere.

This, right here – this is what SOME whites got from slavery.

But because of these high profits, a certain amount of investments that could have been used on railroads, or shoe factories, or something good – were instead used on more slave plantations. This did two things:

It diverted Southern investments into the short-term profits of slavery instead of the long-term profits of industry.
Say you build a shoe factory – that factory has a bunch of machines to work the leather and buckles and stuff, that machinery needs people who know how to work it. It requires iron and steel, and lubricants. Basically you now have a machine-tools industry. Now that you have started making them, machine tools in general become cheaper for other things, creating investment opportunities in textiles, or in metal tea pots and kettles, in coaches, in steam engines.

A plantation has no such expansion effects; and this, to oversimplify a bit, is why the North exploded and the South stagnated. I’m not blaming the black slaves for it, they didn’t DO anything, they couldn’t do anything, but it is merely to say that whites would certainly have gone more in the industrial direction if they didn’t have slaves. I’m not alone in this speculation, and it is hypothesized that Rome would have industrialized if it didn’t have slaves.

It diverted Southern investments away from things that employed white workers and toward things that “employed” black slaves. Any white who didn’t own slaves was made poorer by the fact that other whites did, because investments were diverted from say railroads, which he could be employed in, to slaves.
Now, whether the total dollar value of the short term extra profit (again about 4-5%) some white people got from slaves instead of other investments outweighs the effects it had in directing the South down a long-run economic dead end of being an agricultural resource economy and the immediate impact of denying the white working class in the south better employment opportunities, I don’t know.

Intuitively, I think it absolutely made whites worse off. It certainly made working-class whites worse off, and it may have even ultimately been worse for the investing class who may have ultimately had higher profits in about 20 years if they invested in factories.

However, the BIG argument about the South, through slavery, funding the tariff and thus industrial expansion in the North, is absolutely wrong. Dead wrong.

And really we’re at the point of talking about the additional profit margins of slaves versus the denied opportunities for white workers and the long-term economy-stagnating effects of slavery.

Now in this post I have not gone into the cost of the Civil War that was brought on by slavery, the damaging political externalities of having a large African population in the United States, or the budgetary impact of blacks today. The point of this post was the CORE of it; the idea that whites gained significantly from black slavery.

And whites certainly did not gain significantly. 5% extra profit for the super rich in the South – that may add up to half a percent of GDP of the whole US? If that.

Whether whites in the US, on aggregate, gained AT ALL is more debateable and more sketchy. I strongly feel that we didn’t, but I don’t have any data to back it up, just economic theory and examples. Certainly the theoretical costs of slavery sound like they would dwarf that extra profit, which may add up to 2% of the GDP of the South.

But once you start thinking in these terms, you’re a million miles away from “Whites in the US today, most of whom descend from immigrants who came after 1865, owe their wealth to the profits extracted from slaves”. You’re dealing with very small numbers that are going to be dwarfed by the cost of the Civil War and the budgetary impact of blacks anyway.*

Snide aside, the discussion is about trade, and more specifically, US trade. Unfortunately, US trade is slowing down is beginning to lag behind Western Europe, and is already lagging behind China.

Case in point: around 4-5 spots of the world's busiest ports are in China alone. The others that round up the list are Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai's Jebel Ali, and South Korea's Busan. No US port is the top ten, and barring LA-LB, no US port is even ready to *compete* with the larger ports in the world.

US ports are still not capable of accommodating what are called post-panamax container ships. These are container ships that can carry 10,000+ TEUs (TEU = Twenty foot Equivalent Containers, the standard container used for shipping over 90% of all cargo in the world).

US ports are only NOW upping their game to accommodate vessels that can carry 15,000+ TEU...something most major ports (even those not in the top ten) the world over have been able to do for near a decade. To make matters worse, US ports are just upgrading to accommodate 15,000+ TEU vessels at a time when 20,000+ TEU vessels are becoming the norm.

Factor in current US policy of backing out of trade deals, most shippers/freight forwarders/etc. will soon have little incentive to prioritize US-bound trade lanes because it's costs a fuckton of money to ship shit there, and without trade deals offering tariff/fees waivers/reductions, it becomes hard to justify moving cargo there as opposed to the mush faster, lesser overheads Europe-Asia routes.

BiggerTwigger,s1 2 team-2 country-eng,Manchester United,"I love it, my dad's been in air traffic since he was 18 as an assistant and qualified to become an ATCO when he was 23. I've been around air traffic and airports all my life as a result and always enjoyed playing flight sim games when I was younger. 

Depending on which you prefer to do (tower, ground or radar), the job requires different critical thinking skills. Radar is all about time/space organization and management, not letting things build up in your head to the point that it stresses you (that's when mistakes happen). Tower is pretty easy, it's what most controllers are good at, same with ground. Ground requires somewhat more organization skills than tower, but still not as much as radar.

Overall it's a great industry to be in if you're not a particularly easy stressed person or you don't let stress get to you. I work at Manchester which is the busiest airport outside London, so it can be quite a challenge at times. But that's also why I decided to go into the industry, I couldn't fathom doing a normal 9-5 job doing data entry at a desk.

I get to go all over Europe as part of my job to see how other airports handle their workloads, to observe different systems and management of the airspace. If you want to travel, join the Air Force to become a controller. If you want the money, go civilian. Those are the basic principles of the ATCO world.

Yeah, I know it is the 'loud few' sadly, it just seems they are **ALWAYS** bloody fellow Brits! I don't see Germans or Belgians falling over in the street.

Sorry, ranting. I never voted for that shitshow, and I think a LOT of 'leavers' experienced instant regret.

We are so, so much better off in the EU, and I hope we bring something to our EU brothers and sisters too, and they have gone and thrown it all away.

They will miss it when it is gone, as will all of us who voted 'remain' :(

Hopefully, gods willing there is a way to stop this madness. Somehow.

EAO48,trot,,"&gt; traditional morality

Sexism and homophobia are very moral, apparently.

There is no such thing as universal morality under class society, only classes and their interests. Different classes have different ""morals"" derived from their interests in gaining and maintaining power, and that morality which appears to cross class boundaries is really only the ideas of the ruling class being spread throughout other layers of society. As you remember, ""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas.""

&gt; in the western world

Russia is not in the Western world. It's barely in Europe. Its precursors were always more under the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire, i.e. Byzantium, than of the West. Unsurprisingly then, the 1054 Great Schism laid the foundation for Ruthenian people forming an Orthodox Christian identity vis-a-vis a Catholic-Protestant West.

Roots_Banton,,,"Extra large figs.

From google translate:

Offered is a collection Lego 19 ""figures and other Lego large figures and large stones.

Please see original photos - all you can see is part of the auction except for the 7 display cabinets.

These figures are an absolute rarity and unique rarities.

These figures were never normal to buy, they serve Lego as advertising material and exhibits that are never commercially available for sale.

It took me over 20 years to build this collection. Many of the figures were only available in a very small edition, some of them only 25 pieces worldwide, and most are probably no longer existent. Many figures were not even in Germany or Europe, but I got from Japan, China, the USA or Canada. I've seen many of the characters in just over 20 years only once and bought directly to amounts to be heard. The true connoisseur will surely appreciate the rarity and value of this unique collection.

There are a total of 53 different 19 ""figures, 52 larger figures (alarm clocks, lamps, etc.), 25 normal minifigures and 20 large 4x2 pieces, but please have a look at the original pictures, which certainly say more than 1000 words are new and have never been exhibited, but many were of course also issued and are needed, but nothing is broken.To many figures there is also the original Lego board for each figure.

Reputation before purchase is expressly desired. Pickup would certainly be the best solution; but shipping is of course possible and would be packed very well in many individual boxes.

This collection exists only once worldwide. The only chance.

Please also have a look at my other auctions - there are still many great, rare and always inexpensive items with you.

Damit wollte sie herausfinden, „was die Alternative für Deutschland wirklich will“, welche Ziele die umstrittene Partei noch neben ihrer Flüchtlingspolitik verfolgt. Schließlich werden diese Informationen zunehmend wichtiger, seit die AfD in den letzten Monaten in immer mehr Landesparlamente einzieht. „Ich habe das gemacht, was jeder gute Nerd macht“, erklärt Nocun auf ihrem Blog kattascha.

Bobathanhigs,,,"I don’t know if I agree with that completely. I think that r/Hapas is a very visible and vocal minority. Only 1 Hapa I’ve ever known(which is quite a lot ever since I moved to CA) well tried to distance their Asian side, and she didn’t exactly hate it, she just didn’t embrace it and didn’t really acknowledge it much in relation to herself. This was because of her the Asian part of her family, as a lot of them were not good people(She was “AMWF” for reference, like that really means a lot). The rest didn’t hate their white side either, though a lot did feel like sometimes they weren’t enough of one or both, but compared to the things on that sub it was more “minor”. Obviously some of them could have hid their true feelings, but seeing as I am also mixed and the ones who I’ve talked to about this I know fairly well, I think that it is not incredibly likely.

Punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment, including capital punishment, mutilation, flagellation (whipping), branding, and non-physical punishments, such as public shaming rituals (like the stocks).[10] From the Middle Ages up to the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, imprisonment was rarely used as a punishment in its own right, and prisons were mainly to hold those awaiting trial and convicts awaiting punishment.

**Abstract**

Cooling during most of the past two millennia has been widely recognized and has been inferred to be the dominant global temperature trend of the past 11,700 years (the Holocene epoch). However, long-term cooling has been difficult to reconcile with global forcing, and climate models consistently simulate long-term warming. The divergence between simulations and reconstructions emerges primarily for northern mid-latitudes, for which pronounced cooling has been inferred from marine and coastal records using multiple approaches. Here we show that temperatures reconstructed from sub-fossil pollen from 642 sites across North America and Europe closely match simulations, and that long-term warming, not cooling, defined the Holocene until around 2,000 years ago. The reconstructions indicate that evidence of long-term cooling was limited to North Atlantic records. Early Holocene temperatures on the continents were more than two degrees Celsius below those of the past two millennia, consistent with the simulated effects of remnant ice sheets in the climate model Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3). CCSM3 simulates increases in ‘growing degree days’—a measure of the accumulated warmth above five degrees Celsius per year—of more than 300 kelvin days over the Holocene, consistent with inferences from the pollen data. It also simulates a decrease in mean summer temperatures of more than two degrees Celsius, which correlates with reconstructed marine trends and highlights the potential importance of the different subseasonal sensitivities of the records. Despite the differing trends, pollen- and marine-based reconstructions are correlated at millennial-to-centennial scales, probably in response to ice-sheet and meltwater dynamics, and to stochastic dynamics similar to the temperature variations produced by CCSM3. Although our results depend on a single source of palaeoclimatic data (pollen) and a single climate-model simulation, they reinforce the notion that climate models can adequately simulate climates for periods other than the present-day. They also demonstrate that amplified warming in recent decades increased temperatures above the mean of any century during the past 11,000 years.",True,0,1517686678,,False,0,dtorf7a,True,t3_7v1i32,t3_7v1i32,/r/GlobalClimateChange/comments/7v1i32/recent_temperatures_experienced_across_europe_and/dtorf7a/,1518896547,1,False,GlobalClimateChange,t5_32nqw,public,

AvaRobertEko,,,"Wakanda (fictional as it is) is literally supposed to be in East Africa. It isn’t a depiction of East African culture (which I never said it was) but is described as being set there. I am a comic book head and so is my brother. I don’t know what to tell you- it just is. I understand your examples on Wonder Woman and Thor, except those cultures have not been systematically and continuously grouped together with the whole of Europe in western societies so I’m not sure it’s the perfect comparison to make. 

I never suggested African Americans don’t have their own black culture and would never do something that callous. I think a lot of the style and artistry that does come from this blend of influences is absolutely beautiful and  personal to you in a way I can never quite understand. My issue again is with the fact that time and time again it gets conflated with general ‘African’ garb and we are expected to be comfortable with it. The whole “Africa is one big country” rhetoric pervasive in modern culture is a continued symptom of colonialism, and a symptom of our Eurocentric view of the world- and whilst I understand why it’s a touchy subject for AA people, it is something Africans have every right to feel and will continue to feel until some attempt to be more careful about it is done. 

I truly hope everyone here looks fabulous in whatever attire you choose to wear and we all have a lovely time at our respective screenings. This will be my last comment on this thread because this has been a very unpleasant conversation to have here on r/blackladies (I wish another African woman had stepped in to also add her thoughts).

&gt;**‘O Supremo, que deveria ser o teto, na verdade se tornou o piso’, afirma ministro da Corte sobre pagamento de benefícios**  


&gt; BRASÍLIA - O ministro Gilmar Mendes, do Supremo Tribunal Federal, disse ao Estado que o pagamento de auxílio-moradia e outros penduricalhos a magistrados compromete “terrivelmente a imagem do Judiciário”. “O Supremo, que deveria ser o teto (salarial), se tornou o piso.” Prestes a deixar a presidência do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), Gilmar disse que o País vive “clima fascistoide”. Em Estados que estão com caos financeiro, os benefícios do Judiciário, do Ministério Público, são às vezes garantidos por medidas excepcionais. Recentemente tivemos o caso do Rio Grande do Norte, em que o ministro João Otávio de Noronha (STJ) mandou devolver um pagamento de auxílio-moradia. O STF deve votar em março as liminares dadas pelo ministro Luiz Fux, que garantiu há mais de três anos o pagamento do auxílio-moradia a juízes. Fora xingamentos ou coisa do tipo, o protesto tem de ser visto como um processo normal da democracia. Tenho a impressão, todavia, de que a mídia cumpriu um papel muito negativo, desinformando, personalizando o processo decisório.

&gt; It was probably one of these Brexit consequences that no Brexiteer had considered

It was an integral part of the debate, the official REMAIN leaflets released by the government even included this paragraph:

- ""The Government judges it could result in 10 years or more of uncertainty as the UK unpicks our relationship with the EU and **renegotiates new arrangements with the EU and over 50 other countries around the world.**"" - [PDF LINK] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515068/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk.pdf)

&gt; The UK is a much smaller market than the rest of the EU and therefore in a much weaker negotiating position vis-à-vis third countries.

This ignores existing market relationships, the UK accounts for **43% of all Canada:EU exports**, for example.

&gt; After Brexit, Britain loses access to some 750 international treaties of the EU.

The UK does not need to replicate all of these treaties, **just 2**: EU:Korea and EU:Switzerland represent 80% of total UK trade within these agreements. 

---

*Additionally,* large markets that the EU does not have existing FTAs with, have expressed interest in quick negotiations with the UK post-Brexit, eg. Australia, India, Kenya, Ghana, etc.

For example:

- An FTA with just the USA and Japan alone would give the UK access to **2/3 of the world's market's by value, versus 1/3** within the EU and it's FTAs.

TTIP has been estimated to add £10bn to UK GDP, versus £1bn for CETA, the EU's largest negotiated FTA to date.

It's largely the same song and dance, but substitute a linen tunic of variable length for the shirt and shift. Men wore baggy linen shorts, tied off at the waist, to which long woolen or linen hose were attached. Unless a person had stripped to the waist, as when doing heavy labor, the shorts probably would not have been visible. Outer garments tended to be made of wool. The dominant garment for both men and women, the mainstay of any wardrobe, was a tunic (or kyrtle, or bliaut) of knee to ankle length, fitted or loose, as dictated by the fashion of the day. Square or round-cut woolen cloaks were worn atop these.

So, we're dealing with the same materials worn in about the same order.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Indo-Iranian languages**

The Indo-Iranian languages, or Indo-Iranic languages or Aryan languages, constitute the largest and easternmost extant branch of the Indo-European language family. It has more than 1 billion speakers, stretching from the Caucasus (Ossetian) and the Balkans (Romani) eastward to Xinjiang (Sarikoli) and Assam (Assamese), and south to Sri Lanka (Sinhalese) and the Maldives (Maldivian).

The common ancestor of all of the languages in this family is called Proto-Indo-Iranian—also known as Common Aryan—which was spoken in approximately the late 3rd millennium BC. The three branches of the modern Indo-Iranian languages are Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and Nuristani. Additionally, sometimes a fourth independent branch, Dardic, is posited, but recent scholarship in general places Dardic languages as archaic members of the Indo-Aryan branch.

***

**Indo-European languages**

The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.

There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by Ethnologue, with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Punjabi, Russian, each with over 100 million speakers, with German, French, and Persian also having significant numbers. Today, about 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family.

Autumn_Fire,purpleflair,Mass Effect 3 had a good ending,"I didn't mean that we should let it happen. That's why I said that if we can find a way to get off earth or find a way to manually remove CO2 from the atmosphere then the problem is solved. But as far as I've seen we don't have that kind of technology yet and time is running short. 

Just because it's declining in some areas doesn't mean our population as a whole isn't growing. Fluctuations are expected. But overall our population is increasing, no decreasing. Especially in poorer areas of the world that are beginning to achieve economic success. They are following the same pattern's current first world countries did when they began to rapidly accrue wealthy, a huge explosion of population before an eventually steady line.

Like I just said with cow dung. Modern meds as well. A lot of the meds we use come from ingredients found in the rain forest and other tropical regions. So we have two choices. Either we cut back, let the forests and wildlife return and produce less meds in the process or we don't do that and keep screwing up the planet even more. But we can't both take as much as we're doing now and let it grow back, it's just not going to work out that way due to supply and demand.

It's not wrong. A huge amount of CO2 comes from cow dung. So either we stop cows from defecating or we don't use as many cows. Again, we can't have it both ways. And, unless a sudden surge of veganism spreads through the US and Europe which I wouldn't hold my breath for, we're not going to see much success. This is stuff I learned in my first semester in eco class, I have no how you figure I'm wrong here.

That isn't even close to the same thing. It's not as if I want this to happen. I live in a place full of nature that I'd never want to see destroyed. I'm not happy about the way this is going, make no mistake. But when you look at what we're up against and you look at the solutions as well as the little time we have, it doesn't paint a pretty picture. Sacrifices will have to happen, there's simply no way around it unless we develop some miracle technology with in the next 50 or so years. But I wouldn't hold my breath on that. I'm look at this pragmatically.

MYSTK_RVR,,,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved. In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.

Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.

The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""Beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial band.

East_River,,,"&gt;State ownership as such is insufficient to socialize factories, they have to function as such.

That is a good point. How did Yugoslav factories function? In the first period (1950 to about 1965) the evidence seems to be that they functioned as part of a unified state-directed system. The difference from the Soviet model was that workers had a voice in decision-making within their own enterprises and that enterprise managements would have more flexibility to make decisions on production. 

There were central plans, however, at this point. Enterprises paid into insurance funds that were used to supplement pay for workers whose enterprises were distressed, prices were controlled, there were strict limits on levels of profits, and factories paid rent on state-owned land, plant and equipment because they were essentially leasing the use of those from the government. 

Strong evidence, both in research conducted by people like Woodward and by hints dropped by Kardelj, is that the Tito leadership wanted workers' consent for sacrifices and wage constraints that would be necessary as Yugoslavia built its industrial infrastructure, and would also save by not having to have a big bureaucracy to oversee management. But they were also clear that they believed this was a step forward in the development of socialism, which they were sincere about.

Again, the scope of workers' participation and decision-making expanded over the years. A key problem, without which it is impossible to understand Yugoslavia self-management, is that political and economic decision-making was increasingly devolved to the six republics and two autonomous provinces. The leaders of each wanted to build up their industry, so there was much unnecessary duplication and less coordination than there should have been, especially considering that Yugoslavia was not a big country to begin with.

There were huge inequalities between the republics, and differences in their relative orientations toward trading with the West. Slovenia and Croatia were most interested in exporting, while the more southeast you went the poorer the area and the more industry was geared toward domestic consumption. This was an inherited problem that the Yugoslav leadership tried to solve but made only small progress, progress that was undone during the 1980s.

Nonetheless, there was no capitalist competition within the country. Due to increased integration with the West, Yugoslav production as a whole was subject to competition with Western Europe, with all the distortions and troubles you would expect. 

There is no one neat narrative. Self-management went through three distinct phases between 1950 and 1980, and self-management de facto ceased to exist after 1980, when the IMF pretty much dictated internal economic policy. During this last decade, it could be reasonably argued that private property relations were used, but that is a more difficult argument to make for earlier periods, and I think can't be made for the 1950 to 1965 period.",True,0,1517695519,,False,0,dtoys1c,False,t3_7tvlqr,t1_dtop2eo,/r/socialism/comments/7tvlqr/would_yugoslavia_have_been_better_off_if_it/dtoys1c/,1518900060,1,False,socialism,t5_2qjii,public,

shiobanmooney,hq,Red Mage,"Welcome to Eorzea!

Here are some starting tips.

https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Guide:Progression_and_Level_Locked_Content

The above link will guide you in finding the content you may miss, pass or forget about. It's a handy thing to check up on every few levels so you don't miss out on all the fun content that's been added since 2013.

--------

I see you might be playing on a PS4, please make sure you have a nice keyboard handy, or perhaps one attached to your controller like a keypad. You're going to use it a lot to communicate in FFXIV.

--------------

**""Cross Hotbar""**

As a console player, you'll have a ""Cross Hotbar"" which is your hotbar which works specifically with a controller.

There's no specific one way to set it up, you can set it up in whatever way feels comfortable to you. Play around with things, move them around and eventually you'll find what works best for you.

Don't forget you have multiple ones by holding in the right bumper!

-----------


**Armour**

Armour in FFXIV is more important than it is in some other games, when you start to out-level your gear, you need to replace it.

It can be replaced in a multitude of different ways.

Merchants (usually appropriate to the area you're leveling in)

Dungeons (Boss Chests)

Grand Company (At around Level 20*ish* this will come up)

Crafting (Either you or someone else can craft gear)

-----------

**Hall of the Novice**

You'll reach this around the time of your first dungeon (Level 14/15), please look out for in at ""Aleport"", it's a building marked with a green sprout icon (similar to the one above your head).

If you complete all of the trials for your class such as (Hall of the Novice: Healer) you get a neat EXP ring, and a really nice set of Level 15 gear that'll make your dungeons and questing much easier for you, not to mention provide some lessons as to how FFXIV expects you to aid your party in dungeons.

-----------

**Classes/Jobs**

This is a confusing element to FFXIV at first, this is easily broken down and explained.

FFXIV's original game only had classes, as a result, you start off as a class such as; archer, pugilist, conjurer, thaumaturge. All of these later on turn into 'Jobs', after you obtain the job you'll never it without it again.

An example of this would be; conjurer &gt; white mage.

White Mage will give you access to a whole new suite of abilities that conjurer can't use:

https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/whitemage/

Your character can play any number of jobs you desire. If you want to be a Dragoon one day and a Red Mage the next, you can swap on a dime.

Certain jobs can't be accessed right away, however, the selection you are given at the start are all fantastic ways to start the game.

-----------
Be friendly!

You can encounter some nasty people in MMOs, we all do, but a friendly face usually receives one in kind. If you're new to something, don't be afraid to say!

Never be afraid to ask for help, either here on Reddit in the daily mega-thread at the top of the page. 

Or even in-game.

HermitOfHavoc,,,"Definitely yes, a feedback loop is a good way to view it, or a virtuous cycle. Sociality is in our nature, while society is made up of us.

Marx wasn't so much looking at it from an ethical viewpoint as an analytical one - so he was interested in how ethics would form through society, but based on observing history. So it is accurate for (European) historical development , which was what he based it off. Marxism is a huge topic and I'm nowhere near well-versed enough to comment on it for sure, but I think every stage of society up to communism would have been understood as flawed, and just necessary for the next stage to occur.

For clarity, feudalism wouldn't really allow personal ethics. For those at the bottom of the pile, there was no meaningful freedom, and the entire culture (we're talking medieval times) was shaped by the church and the absolute power of the monarch. Which really makes it a terribly oppressive system much more than a system that has all four levels well integrated - so, not too surprising, on a grand scale, that it eventually fell.

Capitalism would also be understood as oppressive (economically, to the underprivileged), as would socialism (because total suppression of those who disagreed with the socialist revolution would be necessary). In communism, I would think the original conception would be that law would eventually not be needed, because personal ethics would accord with societal ethics would accord with a kind of pan-societal ethics equivalent to shared religion (but Marxism was totally atheistic).

I think the missing link here is the idea of ideology. So a better view for the top level might be to make it shared and unified ideology rather than religion (if we understand religion as being a form of an ideology for this instance). Ideology drove socialist revolutions (in reality, that is) and communism would have been the point when everyone agrees with the Marxist, communist ideology so it's not (or much less) necessary to enforce it. The difference between that and societal ethics is a bit murky, but you could say that societal ethics would apply to someone's immediate social sphere, whereas ideological accordance would be across a much larger society (a nation), and that societal ethics is more of an informal agreement while having a common ideology or religion means that you definitively agree on an ethics that's been comprehensively described and deeply understood.",True,0,1517700742,,False,0,dtp301o,False,t3_7uvu4d,t1_dtog86k,/r/Ethics/comments/7uvu4d/formation_of_ethics_and_power_through_layers_of/dtp301o/,1518902088,1,False,Ethics,t5_2qp8u,public,

sunagainstgold,europe,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe,"Honestly? Most of them, at least as far as the European Middle Ages are concerned. We hear about the big splashy successful sieges, but that's mostly because siege warfare was almost always a *military* failure for the attacking side. The logistics and realities of a siege heavily favored defendants in most cases. Fortresses (castles or fortified parts of towns) stocked up on food supplies, but often were able to trade even with enemy soldiers looking to make some quick money for extra food. And it wasn't just the defenders who had to feed themselves! The besieging army had to eat off the surrounding land, probably filled with hostile people, and certainly less likely to be planted again once plundered.

Furthermore, castle defenses were generally pretty good and frequently improved. Cologne in 1206 was indeed besieged and sacked. What was the immediate reaction? Rebuild the defenses and make them even stronger, so it wouldn't happen again. Even the introduction of gunpowder weaponry to a defensive system established for hurtled projectiles was no guarantee. It took 1514 large cannonballs to break down Maastricht's defenses in a lengthy campaign over 1407-08; in 1480, besiegers of Rhodes expended *3800* cannonballs in their attempt. Defenders learned to build second walls, to build earthwork supports behind stone walls. In fact, apparently a lot of victories over castles and towns in the early gunpowder years came about through intimidation rather than actual strength! The only ""pregnable"" thing was people's emotions.

Again, this is not to say that cities and castles *never* fell, and definitely not to undercut the utter devastation wrought by sackers and conquerors. However, numerically speaking, being the offensive party in a siege campaign was far more often a losing proposition on the military field. Its primary power was through intimidation and coercion to negotiate--a power that the occasional victory certainly did very much to reinforce.",True,0,1517701713,,False,0,dtp3rlk,False,t3_7v27in,t3_7v27in,/r/AskHistorians/comments/7v27in/were_there_ever_any_castles_that_were_truely/dtp3rlk/,1518902455,155,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,public,

Terezin. First page. So much for Terezin.
Strictly speaking there is no even need on the Polish part to officially withdraw from this declaration.

No sane person is expecting Israel to pay compensations to victims of Jews during WW2 or soon after Why? Because these  criminals were individuals. No official state or whole nation took part in it.
There were official requests for extraditions that Israel turned down but that's a subject for another discussion. But by the same token Israel is expected to teach history in the same way. Without focusing on criminals. 

&gt;Poland is profiting off Jewish victims

They were Poles!
I am sorry that it took Jews a few millennia to realized that they need their own state. The people you are referring to were Poles. Poles of Jewish origin. 
But still Poles.  Poland was a homeland for Jews for centuries. Just think about this simple fact, Poland was the country with the highest number of Jews (religion) in the world, census of 1931. Why do you think they did not move to other country?
They were hosted there and enjoyed freedom and liberties.
And because they were Poles the whole claim is absolutely groundless. No lawyer would treat these claims seriously.
For Israel the first principle should be Polish Law from 1930s. And that law does not give Israel any rights whatsoever to the claims Israel is making now.

The only way USA, not Israel, can make these claim progress is either by corrupting Polish political class (we have seen that already) or by economical sanctions (what USA did to Switzerland). 
In either case, Poles will rise and defend the country against unlawful mangling with its internal law by Jews. That I can guarantee you. 
Israel has to respect Polish Law. 

&gt;Shit when Switzerland has more Jews than you
Cherry picking is always a distraction so I am not playing that game.
In terms of non-Jewish Poles living in Israel, remember you could and should expect some symmetry from these relations. 
So, how many non-Jewish Poles are living in Israel? 
But you missed a point - Jews are under attack in Western Europe. Not in Poland

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a story Feb. 2 about a Republican memo on the Russia investigation, The Associated Press erroneously reported that a former British spy’s work on an opposition research project was initially funded by the conservative Washington Free Beacon. Though the former spy, Christopher Steele, was hired by a firm that was initially funded by the Washington Free Beacon, he did not begin work on the project until after Democratic groups had begun funding it.

citharadraconis,,"Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising","I do have a copy of the *Letters* with me, so I am working directly from that and from the video you linked. My assessment is that the other poster is misguided in this particular case, but you're free to make your own judgment; I urge you, however, to do so based on the sources themselves and not on anyone else's interpretation, mine included. If there's one thing I've learned as an academic, it's that even the most renowned and talented scholars can and should be disagreed with. And I realize my analysis is ridiculously nitpicky, but if I'm ""fine-tooth combing"" it, it's because the comments made were different enough from my own impression of the video to make me doubt what I'd watched—so I went back.

The quote is taken from Tolkien's very unfavorable response to a proposed film treatment of LotR (which looks pretty terrible), and in that specific bit he's objecting to making orcs birdlike, as the previous poster says.

&gt;Why does Z put beaks and feathers on *Orcs*!? (*Orcs* is not a form of *Auks*.) The Orcs are definitely stated to be corruptions of the ""human"" form seen in Elves and Men. They are (or were) squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.

And I'm not in the least trying to consign JRR to a ""casual racists"" bin (although that's a pretty hilarious image). I'd have objected if the video had not included ""to Europeans"" because, to me, that's a crucial acknowledgment that moves it from ""casual racism"" to ""knowingly invoking stereotypes that he knows are flawed/subjective."" But the points I got from the quote, as she used it, are a) that the language used, a product of its time, is such that people reading it now rightfully sit back and go ""huh"" b) that here Tolkien acknowledges that he envisions Orcs as resembling a particular human racial ""type,"" even if that's only because his narrative draws on European mythology and historical European conceptions of the ""ugly/corrupted/other,"" and that later fantasy authors/creators continue this trend of using racial traits as shorthand in a lazier and more culpable fashion than Tolkien does.",True,0,1517724480,,False,0,dtpkwft,False,t3_7uvo3i,t1_dtpk9fi,/r/tolkienfans/comments/7uvo3i/racial_coding_in_fantasy_from_tolkien_through/dtpkwft/,1518910703,3,False,tolkienfans,t5_2r6jm,public,

They interfaced sort of side to side and that really made a huge difference.

The first thing the audience knew of that massive incident was an extremely loud and long sound of tires, unmistakably a car being pushed sideways, with no video to match until later, but it was evident that something truly massive had occurred. Not a crash to rewatch.

---

Tonight there's going to be some really sore drivers and tired team members, and one of the drivers from an earlier incident was flown to hospital. 

A lot of heartbreak of mechanical failures and incidents taking out cars through the race was tough and unfortunate loss of the final fuel battle with Porsches and Audis and some AMGs.

Started off with a hope for 300 laps but soon it turned into a slightly mess, difficult race and a really tricky race to call and predict. 

Seeing the team names and liveries from Europe and America here was pretty special I have to say, this is a massive event it really is.

The immense pace of the BMW M6 from the start and the Porsche v Audi battles in GT3 through the race where really nice, but a lot of sadness for losing cars. And so many wheels escaped their cars after incidents. The slow sunrise and beautiful drone shots from the race where really nice. Hard to ignore the attrition and brutality of the mountain. Two majorly silly moves left a nice Ginetta ruined and a 3-4 car one that changed the race and removed the previously trailblazing 43A BMW. Manathey's Porsche and the Viper where pretty good cars to spot this time around. Strakka really had a tough time here, and MARC too.

Honestly I found the final deeply unpleasant though it was told to use all the drivers had left the cars, where in the medical center and being checked, and the race was then declared. I know dread all the crashes from this race ending up in compilations where sick people watch them for pleasure when readers of this thread where enjoying a complex and emotive race. 

Race control and the communication from them over radio seemed pretty good. TV was handled relatively well for the international audience.

I do wish all GT3 cars used the side impact boxes Corvette use (they've helped at least 3 times by my count). I'm sure safety lessons will be learned from the last wreck and I eagerly await the next generation of GT cars. I'm glad I watch racing in this era and with this type of car, is what I'll say.

The track itself is a really mixed bag. It's brutal and unforgiving but this time I wish it had runoffs, even without modern energy-absorbing barriers.

I feel something, but it's such a mixed set of emotions to what I expected. I think I need to think about the race more and reflect on some of the teams.

* Yellow line has Dragonboi, track is complete, plan to replace train when parts are available, right now very short on supplies

**Planned Lines**

* Karachi - Kupang

* Bangkok - Sendai

* Hong Kong - Kupang

* Possible Siberian Track?

**Planned Locomotives**

Long lines are planned to have Standards, whatever I can get until enough Pecos' are sourced, short lines are planned to have Zephers, same situation for parts, but more parts are needed.

**Future Expansion**

Seeing as Oceana is so small, the optimal routes are very obvious and probably will not need help with those.

**Begging Portion of Post**

* Steamers: Strictly Carbon. A couple 3-4 stop lines to clean up map are planned.

* Express: Prefer Regional, but will take National. Others aren't helpful.

* Standard: Any and all

* Zepher: Any and all

* Freighter: Please hold off as I don't want trains past my level, but then again, will not reject the gift.

* Special: Carbon is only really what I'm looking for but will take anything other than Dragonboi.

No matter what the part is, it is very appreciated and I thank you for being a kind samaritan.

**Ending Note**

Once again, any feedback is very useful, I've played before but never to this extent so now I'm pretty blind as to what is ahead of me. If you can help me with my plans, please do so. I'm struggling for parts to useful trains and selling the trash I've collected is building ghost railroads.  Please, any amount of parts will be much appreciated.

&gt; Dintre acestea, mai bine de jumătate au fost autoturisme second hand aduse din străinătate cu o vechime medie care depășește 13 ani

Deci asta cere piata. Spre un milion de masini ieftine. 

Asa ca tu bagi un purcoi de bani (nu doar un pic) in cumparat masini noi. Cum faci asta? Pai ai romanul tipic, care isi cumpara un SH cu 2500 eur, si ii spui: imi dai masina ta veche (care poate nu exista) si eu iti dau un voucher de 1500 eur pentru un logan nou de 8000 eur. Adica 6500 eur. Si romanul se uita la tine asa, cu mila, si zice ca el s-a scormonit in toate buzunarele pentru 2500 eur, _pentru ca atata are_. Generozitatea ta il misca, dar n-are 6500 de dat pe o masina noua. Daca avea bani in plus, isi lua oricum mai bine VW sh decat logan nou, ca-i masina mai buna si-l tine si mai mult. 

Deci pe cine ajuti tu de fapt? Pai oamenii middle class, care isi iau masina noua. Acum, astia chiar au nevoie de ajutor? Pai... nu prea. Atunci, zici ca ajuti tot poporul, ca sunt masini mai noi pe strazi. Doar ca masinile noi sunt cota foarte mica de piata fata de alea SH. Atunci, ajuti cumva producatorii de masini, pe care practic ii subventionezi cu 1500 eur? Mmmm cam da. Si daca adaugi si taxa de inmatriculare, esti chiar robin hood: iei bani de la saraci si ii dai la bogati/producatori. 

---------------------------------------

Iar solutia pentru masinile poluante ramane intotdeauna un ITP relaxat ca norme, dar strict ca aplicare. Si lasi piata sa se regleze singura.

When Franz-Ferdinand was assassinated it should have been a news item and nothing more, but the way Europe had aligned itself meant that a unstoppable machine had switched on and led to war without anyone being able to stop it. 

Consider that Germany's Schliffen Plan had by design accounted for how long it would take Russia to mobilise against it in the event that Germany should be at war with the Triple Entente (Russia, France and Britain). As soon as Germany felt that war was a possibility it began mobilising to move to defeat France before Russia could invade from the East. Like a series of clockwork mechanisms everything fell into place without anyone being able to stall it. 

That could easily happen again. Alliances like Nato, Russia-Syria-Iran, China-N.Korea-Pakistan, Shia vs Sunni.

&gt;But support for a trade-off soars when voters are offered the option of other limitations on free movement that are used by some countries in the single market. Asked to consider a system where EU migrants were sent home if they did not find work, 55% of leave voters said they would be satisfied with this, versus only 25% who would be unhappy. There was only slightly less support for an “emergency brake” option to control surges in immigration.

If 55% of leave voters are satisfied with this as an outcome of leaving the EU (which IIRC is basically the system we have now, certainly available to us in the EEA, again, IIRC.) then they're happy that their vote to leave the EU did not result in a total end of FoM.

lushr,,2ic CF,"[M] I have some issues with the specific combinations of numbers you have in this post, as they suggest missiles with impossible kinematic performance that need to be broken up into different kinds of missile. Most importantly, the S-400 and S-500 break up the air defense and ABM roles across different missiles, while sharing other missiles that fill the same roles. 

&gt; (M - as the majortiy of this shit is either classified or I can't find, eyeball it as 50% improvement)

This is the wrong attitude to take when basing a system off of an IRL one and improving it, since it implies that the physics and dynamics of the systems in question are somehow magical. By just multiplying by a constant factor you end up with blatantly aphysical performance - instead, a more robust set of performance figures can be derived from simple physical laws like the radar and the rocket equation. SAMs, after all, are just like every other kind of rocket (albeit with a really shitty mass fraction in comparison with multistage rockets) and radars are governed by the inverse square law like everything else. These factors make it pretty easy to insert performance margins into real systems, since you can simply model them with the physics then use that model to extrapolate plausible performance increases.

Now, more specific comments:

**Radar Range**

The first issue I would like to point out is that radar range is a complex topic that is physically limited by the radar horizon (and in turn by the curvature of the earth). While the issues at play are quite complex (and I would suggest reading something like [this article on the radar equation](http://www.radartutorial.eu/01.basics/The%20Radar%20Range%20Equation.en.html) if you want to look into advanced radar technology), I would suggest adding some additional caveats to the radar performance (most notably, providing a reference RCS for the listed range figure).

**Exoatmospheric vs Endoatmospheric Missiles**

All three of the long range SAMs here list exoatmospheric interception capability, but this requires both exceptional missile performance (in turn, demanding physical size changes: see the tyranny of the rocket equation) and extremely different maneuvering systems. 

What makes the exoatmospheric envelope fundamentally different is that maneuvering is no longer aerodynamic (e.g. pitching and yawing to produce the desired lift forces to minimize miss distance) but is instead propulsive, that is using rockets to correct the missile's trajectory. In turn, this means that the design demands on an exoatmospheric missile are different in key ways.

In particular, an exoatmospheric missile is going to be a multi stage missile, to maximize mass ratio and therefore delta V. Moreover, and most importantly for this discussion, it is going to have a separate kinetic kill vehicle that separates after booster burnout/shutdown. This KKV weighs *much* less than the missile that boosted it, and is therefore able to maneuver much harder with its rocket thruster. However, this kind of missile has virtually no ability to maneuver in the atmosphere and the KKV will be destroyed instantly by airflow if its deployment is attempted intra-atmospherically (they're made to be light - tyranny of the rocket equation again - not particularly strong).

Endoatmospheric SAMs, on the other hand, are designed to maximize aerodynamic forces. This then requires the longest fuselage possible with big maneuvering fins, producing big aerodynamic forces to steer with. This then precludes complex staging, and even rockets with attitude control thrusters only use them for rapid adjustment of attitude, not velocity as exoatmospheric KKVs do.

As a result of these factors, you can build a missile that works endo atmospherically, or exoatmospheric, but not both. IRL, this is clearly seen across numerous platforms - in American SAM systems, it's the difference between the RIM-174 SM-6 and the RIM-151 SM-3, which are otherwise comparably sized missiles but optimized for endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric engagement, respectively. To fix this issue, I suggest looking more carefully at how the IRL S-400/S-500 interact, what niches they fill precisely, and how it achieves those additional capabilities. In particular, I would highlight the anti-aircraft range of the S-400 and S-500 and how it differs from the ABM range on the latter.

**Propulsion Technology**

That's eliding several major issues along the same front related to propulsive efficiency. Especially in WP now, airbreathing propulsion systems are becoming quite popular for endoatmospheric missiles, but these systems are for obviously not workable at all for exoatmospheric interceptors. 

This then makes me quite interested in what propulsion technology you're using on the missile upgrades, since the apparent physical backwards compatibility makes it apparent that the weight and size of the missiles cannot have changed substantially. If you are increasing the range of the missile by 50%, for example, then overall delta-V must have increased by approximately 22%, which in turn would demand a mass fraction of mf^1.22 where mf was the original mass fraction (which is less than 1). Therefore, either ISP would have needed to be improved by 50% (please explain how, and what propulsion technology you are using) or mass fraction would have to decrease (and lose warhead/fins/airframe) to attain the same range.

**Specific S-500V2 Performance**

&gt; with anti-satellite variant able to reach 1500 km attitude.

This is a major variation, and again runs into delta-V and rocket equation problems. ABMs/ASATs that fit into the S-400/48N6 form factor typically provide maximum altitudes in the 250km range, so running all the way up to 1,500km is a major performance increase again. Delta V demand will run approximately as the square root of the ratio in altitude (so in this case sqrt(6) = 2.44 times more delta V), so where does it come from?

1. Whenever a migration happens, our Slack Nest Team takes it to the city scanner (run by a 3rd party) and within 15-20m have all major nests identified.
2. Head of the team compiles a list of nests in our spreadsheet, in a new column.
3. That spreadsheet is flattened into a plaintext file and reposted to Facebook.
4. Important species (meta relevant, rare Pokédex entries) are highlighted.

Then, since raids are all the jazz and nests matter less and less, casual players on Fb go through the list and see if there’s anything that interests them. Then they check where that is on Google Maps (if it’s not immediately clear) and only then they make a decision if they want to make a trip there over the weekend or if it’s a park near them to farm daily.

From what I see, nobody checks what’s around them or around a pin on a map. This might be because as an European city, we don’t rely so much on cars to travel and we have a dozen of parks within walking distance. So all that matters to you is species, and then you make plans.

Regarding North America: Newfoundland, Labrador, Acadia and possible New England would end up part of the French colony of New France. The rest of British North America would likely stay in British hands as its annexation would be problematic:

""With over 65,000 inhabitants in the late 1750s, Canada was France's flagship colony on the continent"" and "" By 1765, the population of the new Province of Quebec reached approximately 70,000 settlers"" versus aprox. 1,170,760 population of the Thirteen Colonies in 1750.

The Caribbean would likely be annexed by France as it would be less problematic to annex them.

As for the rest of the world:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/SevenYearsWar.png

Portugal would probably end up under heavy Spanish influence, again. The German lands would be dominated by Austria and Catholics instead of Prussia and Protestants, Sweden might also take up more land from Prussia in the Baltics. India would be dominated by the French in the South. In the worst case scenario for the British, Ireland might also become a French protectorate.

Russia's war goals was to weaken Prussia, give East Prussia to Poland and get Courland in exchange from Poland. This would likely result in a stronger Russia in time as when it eventually annexes most of Poland, it would also annex a large part of the Baltic sea coast (the Baltic was the main economic focus for Eastern Europe at the time).

In short, France would become the world's superpower, dominating both on land and on sea and taking most of North America (which in time would become more powerful and annex the Thirteen Colonies or would simply incorporate them if they both somehow got independence) while Austria would dominate Central Europe and Russia would dominate Eastern Europe even more and with a defeated Britain could eventually conquer the Ottomans and annex Istanbul/Constantinople. source: https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/7q0b9t/what_if_the_alliance_around_france_and_austria/ ",True,0,1517746377,,False,0,dtptxb9,False,t3_7v4ej3,t3_7v4ej3,/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/7v4ej3/what_if_france_won_the_seven_years_war/dtptxb9/,1518915043,10,False,HistoryWhatIf,t5_35koa,public,

New-Atlantis,,,"Migrants are essential for a culture to prosper, both economically, scientifically and culturally. All periods of cultural/economic richness involved migrants: Tang and Song dynasties in China, Arab culture between the 8th and 15th century, Italian Renaissance, European Renaissance, European colonialism. ... The Huguenots that had to flee persecution in France helped develop Prussia. The Jews that fled the Inquisition in the Iberian peninsula helped develop Dutch culture. The Greeks and Jews that spread across Europe following the fall of Constantinople contributed to the European Renaissance. Muslims from Al Andalus helped spread knowledge across Europe. Today, refugees invigorate Western culture in many ways (the founder of the richest company is a Syrian refugee), while natives tend to be less active since they have a sense of entitlement. There is no racial purity, not in Europe. We all have migrant blood in our veins.

If you actually meet Muslims from the MENA, you'll find that most are normal people, just like you and me. The narrative feeding into Islamist terror is of recent creation, it does not inevitably follow from the teaching of Islam. Christian, Buddhist, Hindu fundamentalism is just as retarded as Islam fundamentalism.

&gt; The most shocking part is the 52% of those who think homosexuality is immoral.

Homosexuality was punishable by law in most Western countries until fairly recently, and many Westerners still feel uncomfortable with homosexuality even if they don't say so openly because of PC.

In fact, the Muslim world has always been more tolerant of homosexuality than Western countries. That's why many Western homosexuals traveled to the MENA as early as the 19th century. Homosexuality in Muslim countries is practiced privately even when it is publicly condemned by the religious authorities.

The issue is not West versus Islam. The issue is traditional society versus modern society. It so happens that since the Renaissance, European society was identical to modern society. But that will not always be the case. In 50 years Europe may be backward and impoverished while Asia prospers. The competition for staying at the cutting edge will be won by the society that is most open. 

Biologically, Muslim immigrants are not inferior to European natives. Given a chance for developing their human potential they will make a contribution to society. At home they are held back by repressive and corrupt regimes. Freed from these restraints they can develop their human potential. The result will not be an Islamist society. The result will be a new modernity. The failure of Islamist fundamentalists to adapt to modern society condemns them automatically to extinction.
