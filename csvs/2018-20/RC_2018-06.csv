Heath care needs to be fixed because we are spending 3x the average per person as EU countries for worse quality care and a major accident will bankrupt someone especially when pre-existing conditions make insurance companies deny you coverage. Everyone covered or cheaper and better care is definitely needed even if it isn't a single payer system.

I see things like public education budget cuts and extremely high tuition and textbooks as a major setback compared to other other countries who encourage cheaper higher education and have better public education. The better you teach kids, the better (hopefully) they end up running the country down the line, the more informed they are about the world around them, and the ability to have more skill or tech oriented jobs.

For something like abortion, even if you don't like that it is an option, at least try to prevent the need to have an abortion by having a better and more open sex ed with easy access to birth control (reduced teen pregnancies). Possibly better welfare or public service system to help single or young parents take care of their child without it being the thing that completely ruins their lives. After that have a better foster care or adoption system may decrease the need too. Even if you aren't making it illegal, doesn't a large amount of prevention help everyone? I mean abortion can be one of the last choices on the list but more options and prevention always helps.

Environment, I don't want to end up with cities that look like Beijing due to no regulations on air pollution, rivers that catch on fire like in Ohio, or oceans/lakes that you cannot fish or swim in because you will get sick, dying coral reefs, overfishing causing starvation and extinctions.

""While the initial opposition of Margaret Thatcher and of François Mitterrand to reunification has been widely documented, the full depth of both leaders’ anxieties is revealed in papers to be published by the Foreign Office on Friday. On November 28 1989, just two weeks after the Berlin Wall came down, the then West German chancellor Helmut Kohl announced a 10\-point plan for reunification without consulting either his European allies or the ruling Bonn coalition.  That blueprint triggered several private meetings between Mrs, now Lady, Thatcher and Mr Mitterrand to discuss the German question. Memos detailing those discussions, written by Charles, now Lord, Powell, the then foreign affairs adviser to Mrs Thatcher, are among the most striking of the documents to be released.  One meeting between the two leaders was at the European Community heads of government summit in Strasbourg on December 8. Mr Powell relates that Mr Mitterrand spoke critically of Mr Kohl, saying that he had no understanding of other nations’ sensitivities and was exploiting German “national” feeling.""

Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has never forgotten the hostility he faced at a European meeting on December 8, 1989. Ten days earlier he had unveiled a 10\-point\-plan for German reunification and been met with the blatant skepticism of Europe's leaders. In his memoirs, the former chancellor has described how British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously told the heads of state when they were gathered for dinner: ""We beat the Germans twice, and now they're back.""

&gt; Tera Melos is a band from Sacramento, California  , that incorporates many styles of math rock, math pop, jazz, ambient electronics and unconventional song structure all in one, to create their original genre. They are currently a three-piece (formerly four) consisting of Nick Reinhart (guitar/vocals/keyboard) Nathan Latona (bass), John Clardy (percussion).

&gt; Tera Melos play a brand of math rock music characterized by quickly alternating rhythmic patterns, start-stop dynamics, improvisation, two-handed tapping on the guitar, extended open-ended bridges, and the use of effect pedals and samplers. After releasing a four song demo in 2004, they self released their untitled debut full-length on October 4, 2005. The album comprises eight tracks, and was re-issued in 2008 on Sargent House. While some of the tracks on the album feature distorted vocals that are somewhat undecipherable, (guitarist) Nick Reinhart started contributing more prominent vocals to the music with the release of their 2007 split with By the End of Tonight, called Complex Full of Phantoms.

&gt; Right before they started recording their second EP Drugs to the Dear Youth, one of the guitarists, Jeff Worms, left the band. It is rumored that Worms left to become a football star. This has been confirmed by Worms, although he has not cited what college he is currently playing for. On January 19, 2007, Tera Melos released the LP on Sargent House. ‘Drugs’ for short, was a step away from the previous sound they had before and farther into more progressive and original regions.

&gt; Tera Melos have over the past few years, developed a cult-like fan base around the United States and have recently gained some popularity in Europe, Asia, and South America.

&gt; Tera Melos announced on their MySpace page on April 2, 2007, that drummer Vince would be leaving the band to pursue other things, namely returning to college to pursue a career as a math professor. The band began searching for a new drummer shortly thereafter. After a little more than a year, the band announced the addition of John Clardy as their new drummer. Originally the band had planned a long-awaited LP release after touring, however they ended up releasing an EP of covers, featuring songs by The Beach Boys and Polaris, entitled Idioms, Vol. I.

&gt; On November 7, 2009, Tera Melos confirmed a new album due out in 2010 in a myspace bulletin. The post stated that the band was set to begin recording the next day, November 8. The new album, titled Patagonian Rats, was released in September 2010, and like their 2007 split with By the End of Tonight, it included vocals. Read more on Last.fm.

The USA has been the world 'beat cop' for too long. The EU countries pay less than 2% GDP for their militaries. Most of 'Allies' of the USA expect the USA to pay for their protection. These 'Allies' maintain minimal militaries that are at best jobs programs. The USA can no longer afford this insanity with Russia and China creating large and well-funded militaries. In addition, I don't want my children to fight to protect the EU from Russia or Asia from China.

For decades the USA has been 'free' trading with other countries which allowed a lot of manufacturing to be moved to other countries by the industrialists in the name of profits. Maximizing profits for a small minority where much of the money is shielded from USA taxes is not as useful to the country as a large pool of people paying taxes. So add a tariff on all imports to cover the lost taxes of the people who are not employed as a result of these imports.

I'd like to see an additional head-tax on all non-citizens (Except green card holders) with employment within the USA. This would take care of all the H1B visa problems, Illegal alien problems, etc. that people whine about.

Rather than making tariff cuts that are directed solely at the United States, their cuts are mostly directed at other nations.

Again, from that initial New York Times piece you shared,

&gt;China is energetically trying to rally *other* governments to its side in its showdown with the United States. Beijing’s latest move could assuage concerns from many European countries and developing nations about their own trade deficits with China as well as loss of manufacturing jobs. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/business/china-trade-tariffs-trump.html

And, from the Bloomberg article,

&gt;While the levy reduction could be claimed in some quarters as a concession to Trump and will be a boon to U.S. carmakers such as Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co., the move will also end up benefiting European and Asian manufacturers from Daimler AG to Toyota Motor Corp.

Also,

&gt;A duty cut would typically benefit luxury carmakers or manufacturers, like Tesla, that don’t have a local production site. Most automakers produce mass-market models in China.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-22/china-is-said-to-cut-car-import-duty-in-boost-for-lexus-bmw

Lastly, from your other linked New York Times reporting,

&gt;China has carried out a pledge to cut tariffs on imported cars and car parts, the latest move by Beijing to ease trade tensions with the United States. The American auto industry and its workers, however, might be *unimpressed*.

It then goes on to highlight that,

&gt;By cutting the tariff on imported car parts more than on imported cars, China may actually strengthen its role as the world’s largest car-assembling nation.

&gt;Lower tariffs on imported components will make it more attractive for global manufacturers to do much of their final assembly in China, since they will not have to pay as much to import high-tech parts made elsewhere.

And not one damn person took any consideration, regardless how sincere and softly I spoke, nor how comedically over the top, I spoke but no one listened, or cared. 
So, I think that the ""most vocal"" people, saying truthful things or really screwed up and ignorant things, are either semi-famous, famous, or people will needlessly draw attention to them: ""OMG, can you believe this person? *shows video*"" But that's just my opinion, nothing more.

As far as the stormtrooper debacle; yeah, I remember a lot of sad trolls who wanted to poke people's sensibilities with sticks, a few ignorant saps, and a fair number of people who were SW but not EU fans who weren't aware that Clone Troopers were eventually phased out of the Imperial forces, due to instability, decrepit age due to the sped-up aging process, or rarely held it together and remained strong; and that the Empire then took volunteers/enacted conscription depending on the situation and timeline, and were unaware of that, and became angry only because they were uninformed and thought that The Force Awakens was blatantly disregarding the fact all Clones (and mistakenly therefore all Stormtroopers) looked exactly the same as Jango Fett, by having a black stormtrooper. That doesn't excuse it, but it does explain it to a degree.

(Edit: believe me, when i heard about that, I was incredibly con-kiffing-fused as to why people acted as if it was impossible until I saw why they thought so.)

As far as groups who hate female leads in SW; are you sure they're not complaining over the poor quality of the ones we've received in Disney's films in a short-handed/simplistic manner? (Cause if they're saying in all seriousness ""fucking women are RUINING/have RUINED Star Wars!"" then yeah, to hell with 'em in my book.) Or maybe, another unfortunate possibility: the films' quality is being laid at the lead actress' feets? (i.e. it's Rey's fault that The Force Awakens sucks!)

Either way, I'm sorry to hear that for you/the groups you're amidst.

Nao conheço nenhum sub dedicado apenas à comunidade trans e acho que seria maravilhoso que existisse um.

A idéia desse sub aqui é ser um guarda-chuva mesmo, em que todas as pessoas que experimentam de forma não-heteronormativa a sua sexualidade, afetividade,  identidade de gênero, etc, possam encontrar um lugar seguro para se abrir, conversar, apresentar suas dúvidas e buscar informações.

Mas eu entendo também que cada comunidade pode se beneficiar de ter subs mais específicos sobre as suas experiências em particular. Por exemplo, hoje meu sub favorito é o /r/bisexual porque lá encontro uma ressonância grande com a minha próprias experiências.

Enfim, tudo isso pra dizer que eu não conhece nenhum sub, e que se alguém quiser criar, tem o apoio automático desse sub aqui.

E também que se o seu namorado ou você quiserem conversar sobre qualquer assunto aqui, sintam-se totalmente a vontade. Algumas pessoas trans já se manifestaram aqui e acho que tem sim gente suficiente para começar pelo menos um engajamento sobre questões específicas. E daí quem sabe até criar um sub! :)

First off, it's important to note what he is *actually* claiming: 

&gt; First, researchers confirmed the widely known fact that, overall, Americans are much more religious than Western Europeans. [...]

&gt; Second, the researchers found that American “nones”—those who identify as atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular—are more religious than European nones. The notion that religiously unaffiliated people can be religious at all may seem contradictory, but if you disaffiliate from organized religion it does not necessarily mean you’ve sworn off belief in God, say, or prayer.

But note that the study did not refer to ""nones"". It asked about *religious affiliation.* 

So he is NOT saying what the headline said. He is NOT referring to atheists. He is saying that some people who claim ""no religious affiliation"" continue to have religious views, and this is more common among people in the US then among people in Europe.

*Well big fucking deal!* Anyone with a brain should be able to understand that ""no religious affiliation"" is not the same as ""no religion"". This ain't rocket science.

As for the headline, it is disproved by the study itself:

&gt; Indeed, many religiously unaffiliated adults eschew spirituality and religion entirely. **Majorities agree with the statements, “There are no spiritual forces in the universe, only the laws of nature” and “Science makes religion unnecessary in my life.”** These positions are held by smaller shares of church-attending Christians and non-practicing Christians, though in most countries roughly a quarter or more of non-practicing Christians say science makes religion unnecessary to them. (For a detailed statistical analysis combining multiple questions into scales of religious commitment and spirituality, see Chapters 3 and 5.)

All in all, that article is a joke. 

Edit: I will note that if you separate the article from its sensationalist headline, it is not really controversial.

Even Jewish websites will confirm that in the early 20th century Jews represented between 10% to 30% of the entire population and most of them were immigrants from Europe. The true natives of the land who have real roots and connection to the land going back several generations are Palestinians. 

Finally Jordan was virtually empty during the time of the British mandate, while Palestinian cities were vibrant urban centres full of activity and history. So it is the opposite of your revisionist propaganda. It is the Jordanians, about 40% to 60% of them who are displaced Palestinians, not the other way round because historically it was the West Bank of the river Jordan that was populated and built up and not the east bank.

There isn't an impartial way to view Trump because he has no ethics, no standards, and no point of view (other than Trump is the best). Because of this, all newscasts and information will be inherently biased (far more than usual). Media either roots for him without a critical thought (Fox News), or lambasts him without a second guess (CNN, MSNBC).

During the campaign, he did say he wanted to do a few things: kill Obamacare (not done), kill Iran deal (done), exit Paris Accords (done), tax reform (not done), build border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (not done), re-negotiate NAFTA (not done).

He did put forward some long-standing conservative wishes in his budget, but these are largely restricted to tax cuts for richer Americans and lack any comprehensive character that a true tax reform bill would have had.

The simple fact is, the American President is a stupid, spoiled rotten, manchild. Sometimes, when throwing a temper tantrum, the baby does something good (e.g. pursuing peace talks with North Korea). Most of the time, he just insults everyone (e.g. literally anything on his Twitter).

People voted for Brexit because they were tired of mass immigration. End of. They did not vote for Brexit because they wanted to damage the economy or because they were racist or xenophobic. It is not racist to not like seeing the UK radically transformed from a nearly homogeneous British (which meant white, English/Scottish/Welsh/Irish) country into a ""diverse"" nation through importing millions and millions of people from very different cultures and faiths who have brought a lot of troubles and complications with them that the British public really didn't need nor want. 

The British public was remarkably tolerant, but polling for years after years showed strong support for limited immigration (that had existed before 1997) and discomfort at the scale of mass migration. The one time they could actually have a direct vote on *something* that involved immigration (leaving the EU solely to end FOM) they voted to leave. 

Why is this a surprise? It's because the educated experts and academics and journalists cannot bring themselves to accept the simple reality that a lot of people don't particularly care to see too much immigration changing their country too quickly as well as bringing too many people they really didn't want in the UK (aka Muslims). They struggle with this because in their world it's morally right to be diverse. And it's worsened by that they are all products of a small neoliberal (left and right neoliberals, it's all the same these days) class that has thrived in the last 30 years because they reap all the advantages of the neoliberal economy and the benefits of things like freedom of movement while at the same time they don't have to put up with the disadvantages of the neoliberal world they've enforced on the masses and repeatedly told people to shut up and put up with it because it's the *morally* correct world for the future. They do nothing when millions of people feel increasingly left behind economically, and then they tell the same people to shut up when they now have to compete with millions more immigrants for the same resources and jobs. 

Brexit is not complicated. It's very simple. But unfortunately most of these ""explainers"" are as dense and stupid as the aristocrats of France in the days leading up to the Revolution.

Because this way, countries can discriminate against very specific product imports \(and imports from very specific countries/companies\), and encourage the import of others. The complex nomenclature is also useful for statistical purposes.

Developed countries usually allow duty\-free imports of raw materials \(Ore, oil etc.\) and half\-finished products, with some tariffs remaining in industries that the signatory nations want to protect, usually finished products and high\-end technology \(future economic value\) and agriculture \(jobs!\). 

The EU trade policy towards nations with which we dont have trade agreements specifically descriminates against specific types of manufactured goods and agricultural goods. The EU charges significant rates on agricultural goods, but we use a weird system that says the *cheaper* your foodstuffs are, the *higher* our tariff rates are. This is done to ensure a minimum price level for European farmers.

We also charge \(comparatively\) high tariff rates on things like cars \(10&amp;#37;\), clothes and shoes \(8\-20&amp;#37;, depending on goods type\), cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, to name a few on top of my head. We like any kind of product our manufacturing/services sectors need \(industrial machines, robotics, computer screens, printers etc\), so these are usually free. This is usually a good rule of thumb.

In the case of the EU, since we do not have a free trade agreement with the US, the EU and the US charge each other *Most Favoured Nation* rates, so no tariff discounts for us. American products receive the same tariff rates, as, say, Chinese products.

When trade agreements are signed, however, signatory states usually remove tariffs entirely on at least 95&amp;#37; of products, and reduce tariffs on others. The contents of trade agreements are the result of years of negotiations. Trade agreements are used to *divert* trade, so for example, the EU has trade agreements with countries like South Korea, Vietnam and \(soon\) Japan, which will contribute to diverting manufacturing away from China. Of course, the EU will receive concessions from these countries as well, like lower tariffs on EU products, better protection of EU investments and better protection of intellectual property.

What people tend to forget is that rules of origin \([https://www.wto.org/english/tratop\_e/roi\_e/roi\_info\_e.htm](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/roi_e/roi_info_e.htm)\) are also a very important part of trade agreements, which basically boils down to: *how much of the product was produced in country X?*  In modern supply chains, it almost never happens that, say, a car produced in Mexico is produced in Mexico only. Many parts are imported from other countries. Who is to prevent companies from importing a car from China, screwing on one bolt, and claiming it is Mexican? You need to prove that at least X&amp;#37; of the value of the car was actually produced there.

This is one of the things Trump wants to renegotiate: He wants products imported from Mexico and Canada to have to contain higher percentages of ""homemade"" value, which indirectly benefits the US, as parts imported from the US is counted as made in Mexico/Canada for customs purposes. Basically, Trump would like to use the NAFTA renegotiation to boost US manufacturing.

Trump is in some sense using bullying tactics: The justification he uses to increases tariff rates on steel and aluminum \(he is also considering cars\) is considered flimsy by most, at least in international trade law, but very useful as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. Mexico and Canada are in general very happy with the NAFTA rules surrounding trade in goods. Trump must therefore introduce incentives for Mexico and Canada to give him concessions on his most important priorities.

There's usually 3 stages for each battle where Light Tanks make a difference;

Early game - This stage is about getting as much info for your team as quickly as possible - highly dependent on map/position in team.

General tactic is to quickly go to a location where you know you'll be able to spot large numbers of enemies. This can be by Passive Scouting (Fapping in a bush without firing) or Active Scouting (Using mobility, terrain and camo to spot whilst smashing the WASD keys and driving like you stole it)

With both tactics the best thing to do is try not to take damage and conserve your HP for later in the game when you're most useful. This means there is no shame in falling back if you don't have enough support or you think you might be overwhelmed.

If you have a SAFE chance to take out/damage/scare off enemy lights/low tier meds then do it. Make a deal of tagging these tanks with T so your friendlies know they're your biggest threat (and hopefully take them out early!) 

Mid game - This stage is massively dependent on the map, where you are in the team list and which light you're playing. 

During the mid game you work best as mobile support and a sneaky spotter/damage dealer. Try not to take too many risks and again, if you have to fall back then FALL BACK!

It's quite hard to explain how this stage works because essentially you're a reactionary force. 
Use the minimap and look for areas you can make an impact. 

Is the East flank pushing and needs eyes? Go work to help spot those bush fapper TDs.
Is the West flank being overrun? Go lend some fire support to slow down the enemy advance then use your mobility to run if the flank falls.
Did an enemy LT find a gap and is now going full speed towards your arty? Go hunt them down!
Is there 12 enemies on 1 flank and a clear run to the rear lines on the other? Time to make bush fappers regret not moving! 

Make as much use of your assets - mobility, view range and camo. Don't brawl unless you have to. Look for distracted enemies and go for flanking shots where possible (no 2 key spam unless you really have to) 

Remember in the mid stage you're still a support tank and your heavies should be at the FRONT using their HP and armour so you don't have to brawl. 

Late Game - Aka the fun stage! 

This stage is when LTs shine - Assuming your team hasn't folded or stalled for 10 minutes you can now exploit everything that makes Lights great.

You can isolate and take out enemies 1 by 1, route out the last bush fappers and generally wreak havoc behind enemy lines. Flank, spank and run away!

If during the early and mid game you kept your HP (Or at least most of it) don't be afraid to take a hit or 2 - especially if locating a bush fapper TD who doesn't have WASD.

Late game is usually the time to take out arty (As hopefully by now the useless ""protectors"" have moved away or left them to die)

Light Tanks can make a massive impact on your chances of winning on nearly every map, and offer the most rewarding gameplay when done right. The downside is when done wrong you will die and die fast. 

Remember to use your assets and don't be afraid of falling back if you have to. Also don't let friendly meds push you about and ignore TDs sat in useless bushes screaming for spots. Remind them there's no point in you dying for them to get one shot off ;) 

There's a lot more to cover but hopefully that gives you some idea. 

Enjoy!

It's difficult to point to any one specific factor in why Christianity overtook traditional (at the time) polytheistic religions in Europe. My estimate is that a few psychological factors all contributed to its rise in a very interesting way.

(1) as other posters have pointed out, Christianity was a 'proselytizing religion'. This is an interesting factor of itself but it's important to unpack the psychology of why this was so impactful. 

Prostelytiation itself is the act of CONVINCING people with DIFFERENT beliefs that YOUR belief is correct. If your religion demands that you proselytize,  it means that you have to become skilled at convincing people to adopt your views, which is a skill all to itself. Early christians were very good at 'selling' Jesus to people who hadn't been exposed to any form of aggressive religious sales. Early Europe was a ripe ground for religious salesmen because they'd never been exposed to the concept before.

(2) Christianity was one of the first ""fundamentalist"" religions in the region. This is an especially interesting concept to dig into, but early religions in Europe and elsewhere were much less into ""truth"" (i.e. Our gods are literally true) and more into experiental psuedotruth (i.e. We had a bad harvest and usually when we pray to Poseidon rain comes so we just do it, it's a tradition thing). Christianity claimed to have fundamental truth and was aggressive in the way it presented this idea. To Christianity, the idea of jehovah god sending jeshua Jesus to die for our sins, was a no holds barred absolute fact, as opposed to the shakey ""we believe because of our tradition but don't know why"" religions of Europe. To boil this down, Christianity made absolute truth claims, which is a surprisingly convincing rhetorical device. 

(3) Christianity was new. We can observe firsthand how ""newness"" can be an arguement all to itself in getting people to buy in to something. New app, new phone, new technology, new whatever people will buy it simply because its the latest and greatest thing. This concept can also be applied to religious sales. Many in Europe bought in to Christianity simply because it was the newest convincing ""product"".

(4) on to a few of the concepts you brought out in your question details. Previous religions in Europe had mostly been oriented towards a vaguely 'glory / honor' type tradition. You lived an honorable life, did what your 'duty' was, and you'd get a shot at spending time with Zeus in the afterlife. However this left out quite a few people. Society of the Christian Era had evolved into a agrarian / city one, and many people didn't fit into the traditional roles that religion had set out. What happens if you lived life as a rogue or bandit but wanted to change your life and live one acceptable to society? Christianity answered that, whereas older religions didn't. What if you were a slave and wanted to one day be free and integrate into society? Christianity once again had an answer whereas older religions didn't. The takeaway is that Christianity had more answers to the problems of that era than the older religions, and hence people flocked to it.


The tldr is that Christianity had a massive competitive advantage against older western religions due to its newness and aggressive approach towards conversion.

I'm starting to have hope, that this shit won't go on forever, that we CAN be saved, that this utter SJW-Insanity that spreads here as well is NOT the finite answer to everything and that I'm not the only one who sees how insane it is.

The thing with Germany is, that Germany is extremely afraid of acting like Nazis again. So they try VERY hard not to. By being VERY obedient to the state and extra-""liberal"" in the refugee crisis. But they do it with an extremisms that made them Nazis in the first place.

Let me explain:

Assume that the Germans have ingredients for how they act. These ingredients are: Obedience, Conformism, Coquetry, Sense of Superiority, Need to fit in with your Peers, Need to be a part of the whole They cooked a soup in 1930 with these ingredients, because that is how Germans WERE and STILL ARE. So they cooked a Soup, using these ingredients and got a Nazi-Soup. It tastet sweet at first but had a very, very bad aftertaste.

Fast-Forward to 2018. The Germans are VERY AFRAID of EVER cooking a Nazi-Soup again, but they do NOT understand that they're using the VERY SAME INGREDIENTS again, just in a different situation. They're using these Ingredients, because THIS IS HOW GERMANS A-R-E. I'm a German and I'm telling you this. The Germans of 2018 are NOT ""healed"" from what made them Nazis. (Edit: What I have to add here is that this does not mean, that the Germans are genetically EVIL. Imagine if you have a GOOD Ruler that can ""use"" the German potential. But with the Germans you can make them into Tools of war very easily"")

We see that, because they're cooking a soup, using THE SAME INGREDIENTS: Obedience ""The State knows what is good"", Sense of Superiority ""Look, we take in ALL the Refugees, we're the GOODEST of people"", Conformism ""The Neighbour does that, I can't POSSIBLY to things otherwise.

In fact, what they cook is another Nazi-Soup, it tastes the same, just has another name. And when they trink it this time, the outcome will not be as devastating as the last time, because that depends on the situation. It's not the same situation, it's absolutely different. It STILL can destabilize Europe all over again and lead to worse things.

I find the idea that some text in an ancient language that wasn't even prolific enough to be copied (the text, not the language) would have been pivotal to human development a little far fetched.

That being said, I think it’s a combination of many factors with gun violence over there, a long standing culture and glorification (think generic Wild West cowboys) of weapon usage, lax controls and non standard laws laying an even baseline universally, lack of exposure to correct and acceptable usage of weapons and the safeties etc., sadly I think that it is so ingrained and such a longstanding issue it would take several civil wars to change. 

Great example is one of the Northern European countries, not sure exactly which but I think it was Sweden, where civilians have a mandatory military period, are trained and exposed to firearms and upon discharge are given their weapon to store at home and having next to no gun violence. Yes there’s strict controls on ammunition but much easier to pocket a few rounds here and there than to procure a firearm. 

Also, there are many many stories of armed civilians stepping in and either preventing crime or assisting law enforcement but they aren’t glorified in the media like all the school shootings and other acts of random violence. I’m sure you’ve seen some on like Facebook or something (there was one I saw with a crim beating a lone police officer with a weapon while holding them down when a civilian shot the crim and saved the officers life, no charges laid either) but nowhere near as often as the negative or on as large a scale as general media.

If you get siege from rewards and don't want it, you can send it to a commander or sell it on TP. Generally commanders will have an idea of howmuch supply they want to use where, and for what. Dropping your own in addition is usually not helping. If you're not following a commander, you can drop siege where you please but be mindful that not every wall can be killed, and many many spots can easily be countered.

If you repeatedly die very early in the fights; it's time to start listening to voice comms and get a proper build. There's no fun in constantly trying to make your way back to the zerg. You get more bags and more entertainment by playing well and winning fights \- so put in the effort that requires. 

**Join the squad.** I understand this isn't true for all groups everywhere; some guilds like to run closed squads but still don't mind pugs to follow; especially on NA. However, especially on EU a lot of servers run ""open"" raids with pugmanders. \(Often blue tag on EU\). Players in squad will usually get considerably more buffs, and can get devided into subgroups to fix boons &amp; healing properly. It also gives commanders information about the health and whereabouts of their players in a more trackable way. In my experience players in squad will almost always res others in squad first. Not every server accepts every class in squad; squads can only hold 50 players and some classes do have boon priority over others when playing ""meta"".  

It may seem like you have no influence over the outcome of zerg fights due to numbers, but you do. And from my point of view, you can do this with virtually any meta class \(fb, splb, scourge, rev, chrono, weaver\) altho some are easier than others. And some are much better when played vocal \(chrono for example\). 

A good bubble will enable everyone in range to spike, and gives a clear place on where to localize damage when placed right. Good commanders or even just pugs that see a good bubble go up will capitalize on it. 

A good firebrand will allow 4 people to do signifcantly more in hard fights, and overbuff many others. I'd say a good firebrand buffs the DPS of each player by upwards of 50&amp;#37; especially in harder fights, and allows each player you support to do their role far more consistently. Or perhaps the enemy revs are farming your flank players; but in the end all it takes is a few good range or sometimes gank players to pressure them enough that your flank can live. And when you give them freecast; even very new players can pressure a lot of enemies. Or perhaps you're chrono who turns questionable melee pushes into great melee pushes by simply calling a pull and spiking players rather than attempting to train them down with your zerg. The difference \(in momentum\) between quickly spiking 3 players down with localized CC and damage versus trying to chase players with a blob is the difference between farming spread gank style players and slowly getting clowned. 

In weaker groups it's not even rare to see single players do upwards of 30&amp;#37; of damage, very high number of corrupted boons, condies cleansed and so forth. 

Likewise, not pressing your buttons \(well\) can escalate quickly too. If you get engaged on and you don't use stab on time as firebrand, then party members are going to burn cooldowns or die. Even if you're the one engaging, not popping stab at an appropriate time while you engage will lead to half your party already trailing behind due to a single line or static; and make them unable to provide any pressure on the first spike. 

I've seen blobs with more than 5 spellbreakers wipe before dropping more than 2 bubbles. And most range or DPS players in the game don't know that they can drop damage behind themselves with look behind and / or free camera; and prefer to just let their melee die alone while they're disengaging. 

**It's a very, very team heavy gamemode.** Your allies rely on you to do your job, and you rely on them to do theirs.

For starters, almost all of Europe has a relatively low fertility rate, which can be explained by the second demographic transition (as of 2016, no single country in the EU is at the replacement rate, or even above 2.0) In the post soviet sphere, the low fertility rate is better explained by the economic shocks of the nineties, and the resulting societal problems like alcoholism. 

In no way is there any kind of causal link between legalized homosexual relationships and low fertility. The second demographic transition has occurred due to contraception, the increased presence of women in the workforce, women in higher education, alternative forms of cohabitation, migration, and a general increase in individualism and autonomy. 

Just for fun, to take your bad logic one step further, we might say that homosexuality leads to higher fertility rates in Europe, as Sweden(which is actually a very interesting case if you want to examine how family policy and legislation can have an effect on the fertility rate) and France have the highest fertility rates in Europe. Denmark, Norway, and the UK also have relatively high fertility rates. On the other hand, Bulgaria, Poland, Serbia, and Albania have low fertility rates. (Source: Eurostat) Your conclusion, therefore, should be that increased rights for the LGBTQ community lead to higher fertility rates. 

If you actually want to increase the fertility rate, it’s much more important to decrease the opportunity cost of having a child, not resist the normalization of LGBTQ rights.

[The incident involves Southern sitting in a small boat, floating in front of a large boat, chanting slogans:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KziepDf53C0)

1. The NGO boat was \*leaving\* Sicily to go to Libya; there were no asylum\-seekers onboard
2. The NGO boat was a medium sized vessel, not the kind of rubber dinghy that risks people 'drowning' as you indicate
3. Any seafaring vessel operators have been protected by legislation by the EU from punishment for transporting 'refugees'. Generation Identitaire \(the group Southern was with\) and other [independent organizations](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-04/something-strange-taking-place-mediterranean) assert that this arrangement has allowed criminal organizations to embark on human trafficking enterprises, apart from the already confirmed general illegal immigration.  
Black market smuggling is confirmed as a reality regarding the Europe migrant crisis by the UN; the routes the NGO vessels take suggest that there is extra\-legal activity going on.

4. According to a UN report, [less than 5&amp;#37;](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fjustpaste.it%2Frifugiati&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url) of the people traveling to Italy in 2016 under this paradigm were found to be refugees.

5. Generation Identitaire have explicitly stated that they will not hinder rescue operations or put people in danger

6. Generation Identitaire were in a comparatively tiny boat, waving a flag, right in front of the Italian Coast Guard. This is was political activism, nothing more.

Secondarily, I see the fact that she was banned from entering the UK being brandished as some sort of proof of guilt.

1. She was banned from the UK for [taking part in a social experiment, distributing pamphlets on a street saying that 'Allah was for gays'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxjH5hZYTbQ)
2. An angry crowd of Muslims soon formed.
3. The police shut the stand Southern was at down for *their* safety, as well as 'keeping the peace'.
4. For this, she was later banned from entry to the UK under their *Terrorism Act*, for *racism*.

Let that sink in. She spoke proposing that Islam is inclusive of LGBT, got charged with racism, and banned under the Terrorism Act.There are of course ample video proof that prove this is the truth.

You shouldn't let your society go to shit because of people calling you a bad word. The process of importing foreigners with a foreign language and foreign religion into Europe has so far been a failure. It basically resulted in having an foreign outpost being funded by the natives. We have seen the third generation of Muslim immigrants being less integrated than the second, presumable due to their numbers and the fact that they are creating parallel societies. There is absolutely nothing that indicates that thing will improve.

You're not going to see your precious western values emerge from these migrant communities and they have reached numbers where we no longer have the cultural impact to influence them. They watch foreign TV, they speak foreign language at home, their complete surrounding is 'foreign'. There is nothing anymore to integrate into. Talking about 'integration' is a farce, you can't, It's been already out of our control for a decade and longer. You're going to need western people for these 'western values'.

So call her a racist, a pedophile, a suppressive person, a satanist , a counter-revolutionary, a kaffir, a reactionary, a jordan-peterson fan ... Every islamic migrant she blockes contributes more to preserving western civilization than any confused rant about sticking to 'muh values'.

-----------

&gt;I've read most of the comments in this thread and it is true, no Turk managed to provide a source for these claimed massacres. If it did truly happen, there would be all kinds of records and articles about it.

Not necessarily. Problem is that most European sources both contemporary and today regards Greek independence in a romantic light. It is seen as a righteous rebellion that broke from an occupier. Yet such idea is wrong in that Ottomans controlled much of Balkans before even Anatolia. And how can a state can be considered an occupier in a region it was founded and controlled for hundreds of years? By same logic US would be an occupier as well, no? 

Millions of Turks, Turkified locals, and Muslim locals lived in Balkans. Consider the amount of destroyed Mosques. A mosque is proof of a Muslim community living there as they are constructed due to a need. Millions of muhacirs(refugees) came into Ottoman empire as it lost those lands. Most mosques in the region have been destroyed. Sufi(esp. Bektashi) tekkes which just like mosques served a community are either destroyed, or only its remains are there. Not one or two, hundreds or maybe thousands. Yet how much european sources we have regarding these people moving to Ottoman empire? Even for that, I have barely seen any mentions. How can millions of people can be ethnically cleansed but we have so little sources regarding its reasons? I can't remember any condemnations regarding it unlike Ottoman actions towards Armenians, Greeks, etc.. Did they move for no reason at all? So, yes, we can certainly have very little sources for a big event. 

**The document shared in this thread is contemporary to the events and confirms massacres. It is the proof you are asking for.** Unless you have proof regarding its falsehood, I fail to understand why you disregard it. Do you consider it fake? Why? Can you prove it? 

&gt;Also, you're trying to portray Turkey as a big victim in the Balkan Wars when this isn't true. Turkey wasn't some small, poorly defended country at all. It was the aggressor when it comes to the Balkans for centuries and all the shit the Ottomans have done has turned against them at some point.

So? How does that affect Balkan Muslims? So a country going to war justifies people being ethnically cleansed or massacred? **Why do you even mention this at all?**

Actually Junker, the person asking the question was asking about opportunity, especially for those that are young and living in Southern Italy. Fighting corruption (which is present in many countries across the EU) does not resolve the problems experienced by citizens that happen to be innocent victims. 

Italy was one of the founders of the EU. It is as much of an EU problem as it is an Italian problem. It's a matter that can be resolved or at least helped by external influence from the parent bloc. 

The recent Italian elections have shown people are losing faith. A trend that seems to be growing across Europe and your usual stance of 'ignoring' and 'pointing the finger' whilst refusing to admit it's also an EU problem only adds fuel to the fire.

Illegal immigrants entering the EU from Northern Africa is a European problem. Italy who happen to be geographically located closet to the entry location were left to deal with the problem whilst the EU took months to formulate a draft solution (long tern plan still up for debate) whilst insisting the Italians deal with the immigrants and act accordingly. 

Junker is out of touch and the sooner he steps down the better it will be for Europe. A former prime minister of Luxembourg, a country that has contributed the tinniest amount to the European project in comparison to other member states. Who the fuck is he to state ""Italy should do more work"".

Title: **[US][EU] How do I find a lawyer for Terms and Conditions?**

Original Post: 

&gt; EU laws recently changed. Lots of companies updated their privacy policy. I'm creating a website at the moment, and this reminded me of the very important page that needs to created. This is going to get expensive, so I need to make sure I'm doing things right :/
&gt; 
&gt; How many lawyers do I need? One for U.S and one for EU laws? Where exactly do I go to find them? I'm not too sure about simply googling for a lawyer, as I don't know what I'm looking for, and/or if they are a scam.

A citizen of Serbia, objectively speaking, is very accurately represented by the ""Serbia"" flair. There is no objective counter-argument to that. If it were possible to have both the flag of Serbia and the Albanian flag, I am pretty sure that the user in question would have gone for that, as it is exactly what he/she does in r/Albania.

Yes, but I'd say an Albania flair is an even more accurate. 

&gt;A citizen of Serbia being critical of Milošević and the Serbian role in the Yugoslav wars of the '90s? Say it ain't so! It's not ""arguing against Serbia"", by the way, notice the considerable difference.

If, according to you, only Albanians/Hungarians/Croats/minorities are allowed to oppose that, while Serbs are expected to ""defend Serbian honor and joint stance at any cost"", it says a lot about your mentality, really, which is similar to herd mentality. In real life, I have met a handful of ethnic Serbs from Serbia, living here in Germany, that share the same anti-Milošević view as the person above.

No, it wouldn't. I cannot say this loud enough: You are a free citizen and you are allowed to be opposed to the politics and policies of the country you're a citizen of. Thankfully, the era of forced censorship and dictators is gone, and there is absolutely zero need to go back to 19th century rhetoric either.

These are good points. But not what I meant. I too hate Vucic, Dodik and all the other fuckfaces we have to put up with. And I'm pretty sure he does too. That's fine. 

But the matter of Kosovo is one that goes beyond the crooks. It's a national matter between us and the Albanians. Having one sides flair while supporting the other makes no sense.

Again, same as if I with a Bosnia flair was arguing here that Bosnia should be split into pieces.

&gt;Well, he/she is Albanian by ethnicity. That his/her hometown isn't part of the country of Albania isn't his/her choice and cannot be remedied today. That's just how borders were drawn in 1913, for the better or for the worse. Preševo is in Serbia and Serbia is a multi-ethnic country; there is no actual conflict between being ethnically Albanian and having the ""Serbia"" flair. I sure hope you're not implying that Serbia should treat its minorities as second-class citizens and that they're supposed to ""know their place"" online.

There is no conflict indeed, on its own. But when you argue against Serbia for Albania in the Kosovo issue, there is. It makes no sense to use our flair and not their's if so.

&gt;I beg to differ. In real life, my ethnicity has zero effects on my rights - it's not even marked on my passport - and nationalism doesn't pay my bills. Personally, I have a stronger tie to the country I live in right now than to the country I come from. How strongly one feels about their ethnicity is a personal matter, but it also does not strip away their citizen rights.

Well, we simply disagree here. I feel a lot stronger tie to Serbia than Bosnia. Obviously this is quite different from your case no doubt considering the war here.

&gt;Actually, I honestly find this way of thinking quite irrational and outdated. That is how you and some others (mostly Eastern Europeans) choose to interpret them, and it's often ruining this subreddit's comment sections with all the circle-jerking and even brigading.

The intended meaning and the official association of the flags in r/Europe is with countries/regions, not ethnicities, the end. Let's all just get along now, please? Thanks.

Again we disagree. The way I see it while these are multi-ethnic countries and the countries of everyone living in the them they're also countries of every person of its nationality. Serbia is the country of every Serb, Albania every Albanian etc. 

And I fail to see why it's outdated or irrational. These are nation states whose roots mainly lie in the rise of nationalism.

The sentiment that people shouldn't go to more than one show of a band so that other people can get tickets. Some people follow a whole tour, going to every concert, some people Korean or Japanese fans fly all the way to the US our Europe to see their favourite band overseas and vice versa never has it ever occurred to me that someone would interpret this as fans taking away tickets from others. 

There are bands and I am sure BTS is one of them that have dedicated fans following them around the world. And there is nothing wrong with that at all. 

All the time it was people being happy for others being able to see more shows, those people would write concert reports that were then discussed by those who couldn't go, it was a great community feel. 

I am sorry to say this but what you are writing seems a little like virtue signalling  to me ""Look how selflessly I acted why can't you act as selfless as I did"". To most people the thought of ""taking away ticket of other Armys"" probably never even occurred. 

First there is no guarantee that the ticket you don't buy actually goes to a fellow Army and second, like I said, who are we to judge if someone ""deserves"" to go to one concert or not or if someone ""deserves"" to get a ticket. 
Every show is different you are never watching the same show that is the whole appeal of going to different shows.

And so I'm not being completely useless via a boastful and condescending post, OP, since you're working with a limited time frame to get this done (churning usually requires a few months min lead time to be optimal) you should look into getting the Barclaycard Aviator Red.

Also, please check on American Airlines and search to make sure they have a route to your destination from your home airport, and search via flights paid with miles.

Markovia is also interesting.  In my understanding, I always thought it was in Eastern Europe, but this map shows it bordering France, and from it’s location and shape, I believe it to be made up of the Saarland and part of the Rhineland of Germany.

The majority of what he predicted never came to pass. The only things that did were anti-Americanism in Europe and conflict with Ukraine/Georgia. Make enough wild speculations, and some will come to pass. Literally everything else he predicted went into completely opposite direction, from Kuril islands to Japan (fortified and regularly visited instead) and ""dismantling"" China (Russia ceded a lot of land in border negotiations, as well as agreed to lease even more land for 99 years in Siberia) to ""special status"" of Poland or Baltic states.

I'd agree that if you take only his predictions on Britain or Georgia, it rings eerily true. But taken in context of all the other stuff he wrote, it's just the safest bets he'd made. Just look up all of the other ""predictions"" conveniently listed in that article. 

As for sources on his books somehow being used as a guideline, there won't be any. Because it doesn't happen - both ""sources"" mentioned for these claims in the wiki article you linked say nothing about it. Nor do they provide any justification, let alone proof of that happening.

What may have been taken for ""being used as a textbook"" was Dugin himself becoming a professor in the Moscow State University. He was constantly boycotted by the students for the insane and blatantly propagandist stuff he preached (literally) there. He also got kicked from his teaching position for expressing very radical anti-Ukraine sentiments. In 2014. In Russia. That alone tells how much of a nutjob the guy is.

Hamas is loved among Palestinians you may look at this [election result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election,_2006). Hamas calls to wipe Israel off the map, and doesn't want to recognize Israel in any way or as part of any deal.

Israel PM term is 4 years, and the Ehud Olmert talks were going for 2 years! Ehud Barak's talks ended before the end of his PM term, it's not our fault the Palestinian leaders are tyrants since 2006, and therefore have any time in the world to make agreements because they don't hear their people.

The main reason why Israelis tend to reject any peace plan now\-days is the lack of trust in the Palestinians, when Israel went out of Gaza, Gaza was almost completely sovereign the army wasn't there and no blockade was up \(only few restrictions were practiced\), that situation lasted for three years, till Hamas managed to hold control in Gaza and shook himself from any previous agreements that the PA made with Israel and threatened to carry out terror attacks.

The WB is an hour drive from Tel\-Aviv where most of Israelis live, like I said in other comment, if the PA will be sovereign most probably [Hamas will gain control over the WB](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8nfwzl/countries_that_recognize_kosovo_vs_countries_that/dzvrv2t), rockets will probably be a daily routine for most of the population in Israel, in contrast to the present were only the people around Gaza strip ""enjoy"" the rockets.

I live in one of the biggest cities in Israel and it's only twenty minutes drive from the WB, do you know how much time you have to seek shelter in those situations? less than 45 seconds.

Review below:

&gt;Do not buy this game. If you did, refund it immediately. The game is godawful in every aspect and is just one huge cash grab. There are many, many issues with the game, but I will try to list only some of the core ones.
Cannot teleport to dungeons without spending real money
Whereas in other popular MMOs you get teleported to dungeons for free, on Bless Online you are forced to either walk there or spend cash shop currency each time.

&gt;See: https://i.imgur.com/QF5QkoU.png

&gt;You would think that they would have at least included it as a $15 monthly sub benefit, but even that would have been bad. The developers are finding ways to milk players dry of their money in any way possible, even though the game just came out and is B2P (with an optional $15 sub AND cash shop). There is also no cross-server queueing for dungeons like you would expect from an MMO in 2018.
Infinitely loading splash screen bug and no communication from developers
The game needs to be restarted repeatedly until it finally loads, usually taking around ~20 client restarts each time. I myself have already restarted the game around 60 times today just to play a few times. This infinite loading screen issue has been present for well over 40 hours now, and the developers are not even acknowledging the issue or talking about a potential hotfix, even though thousands of players have been complaining about it all day long. It just feels extremely unprofessional on their end, both from an apparent lack of (any) testing and a lack of communication.
Inaccurate and absurd Toontown-like chat and name filtering
There is forced chat filtering (which cannot be disabled) that censors words such as ""how"" or ""who"" since the word ""ho"" is detected in them, which makes me feel like I am playing a broken version of Toontown from 2008. Players are restricted from using player names such as ""Muffin"" as well. For a game that has been in development since 2009 with a $60 million NA port budget, this is just outright embarrassing.

&gt;The reasoning for any form of filtering does not make sense either, since the game was marketed towards adults, and there is mild nudity in the game. You can also set your boob sliders very high and make your character very erotic looking.
Poor English Translation
The English translation is obscure and riddled with errors. Due to the poor translation, some quest tasks are too confusing to complete, and it is hard to understand what your character's abilities actually do. Even the most basic of things, such as the level up message that pops up each time you level up, has badly formatted text and is bunched together.

&gt;See: https://i.imgur.com/XHn0gH4.png
Lack of UI settings, screen resolution bug, and terrible default settings
It is not possible to change your screen resolution through the ingame settings without causing the game to freeze and blackscreen, which forces you to restart your PC. As of right now, the only way to safely change your ingame screen resolution is to directly edit the config files.

&gt;It is also not possible to customize the UI interface at all. You cannot resize core UI parts such as the chat or the mini-map. And there is a massive lack of game settings in general. Want to turn off the 60 FPS cap, increase your game FOV, or disable the inconsistent mouse smoothing? You have to manually modify the config files.
Terrible Optimization
I get 30 FPS and stutter in more than half of the areas in the game (even worse in populated areas such as the city), despite having a GTX 1080, i7 7700k and an optimized config. I can only imagine what sort of unplayable performance I would get in a 100vs100 battleground.

&gt;Streamers opinon about the game (both streaming with 100k viewers at the time):https://clips.twitch.tv/BlatantFineFriesBCWarrior
Item Dupe Bug
There is an item dupe bug that is still present from the previous, outdated versions of the game. There are already thousands of duped items, again without any acknowledgement from the developers about a potential rollback or anything. The fact that the developers even released the game, without fixing this known issue beforehand, is just beyond me.

&gt;See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8dXV3AUwQQ
Buggy tab-targeting and lack of fluid action combat
When you tab target, it sometimes randomly targets the enemy behind you. An action-cam mode would fix this, but there is no action-cam mode for any of the classes except the Berserker, and even on the Berserker it does not feel natural.

&gt;Additionally, a lot of the attack animations lock you down in place so it does not feel fluid at all, and to make it even worse, some of the chain animations have a delay that makes it feel as if you are playing with 500ms.
Problems with potential future server merge / losing player names
Instead of adding shared servers and more channels, the developers decided to add 6 more servers on both NA and EU, which will become a huge problem in the future when the game's hype dies down. The servers will likely merge in an effort to boost player interaction, and some players will be forced to pick new player names (and maybe even lose their guild) due to them already being taken.
Excluding classes and content from the game on purpose
The game is missing the Assassin and Mystic and pretty much all of the endgame content that is present in other versions of the game, which the developers probably took out intentionally just so that they could gradually add the ""new"" content through the course of a couple of years without doing any real dev work.

&gt;And oddly enough, even though the Assassin class is not in the game, enemies still drop Assassin gear which is useless.
No Endgame - developers deceived players about there being one
The current version of the game, compared to the versions on RU and KR, is missing a lot of endgame features.

&gt;Some missing features are:

&gt;•	No Daily Dungeons

&gt;•	No Arenas or Battlegrounds

&gt;•	No PvP Ranking System

&gt;•	No PvP Reward System

&gt;•	Basel Canyon (main PvP map) is empty without mobs

&gt;•	No Royal or Honor Quests

&gt;•	Only two ""end game"" dungeons with exactly same gear score drops

&gt;•	SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, so you cannot progress past level 45.

&gt;•	Skill Gem acquisition is broken

&gt;•	No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)

&gt;The developers were quite deceiving about the lack of features as well -- selling founder packs and advertising a headstart as if there was an end to run to, plus falsely advertising about there being some end-game boss dungeons which are not present in the current version of the game.
Pay2Win, Overpriced Cash Shop, cash shop currency is CHARACTER bound
Cash shop currency is restricted to the specific character that you bought it on, rather than your entire account like in other MMOs, which is quite obnoxious.

&gt;And even though the game just came out and the developers claim a pure B2P, non-P2W marketing model, there are still a lot of convenience items in the cash shop, such as potions, experience and gold boosters, repair kits, resurrection scrolls, teleport scrolls, and even 20% dungeon point boosters. All of these items do give you a competitive advantage over other players even if only through faster progression, which I personally would consider P2W nonetheless.

&gt;On top of spending $30 for the game and an optional $15 sub, you still have to spend $20 on stuff like costumes, pet customes, pets, and mounts, or $15 to change your character's appearance. 

&gt;Want more inventory slots? Spend $10 for 8 inventory slots.

&gt;Want to reset your skill tree and try out a new build? Spend $5 in the cash shop for a reset scroll.

But here are the FACTS and they are well documented and sourced:

What was Germany's status before Merkels announcement/statement?

In the whole of 2014, there were 626,960 asylum appliactions in the EU countries, 202,645 in Germany. This marked an increase of almost 60% compared to 2013, or an increase of 160% to 2012. Source: Eurostat

In the first eight months of 2015 (so before Merkel made a statement), Germany had 263,085 asylum applications (which is already more than we had in the whole of 2014). Source: Eurostat

Dublin rules were officially still in place, but generally not enforced in regards to Greece. Reason: Both German courts and the ECJ prohibited it to deport to Greece based on Greece not being able to offer a humane treatment to its refugees. ECJ Case C-4/11. As a result, it was impossible to enforce Dublin.

Third week of august '15: In a meeting between the ministry for migration and refugees, the ministy of interior affairs and the federal states, the question about the refugees from Hungary arises. All parties agree that we would put Hungary in a bad situation if we strictly applied Dublin and sent back all refugees into a country that was already struggling severely. Reminder: In the first eight months of 2015, Hungary continuously had significantly more asylum applications than any other european state, including sweden and Germany. In august, Hungary had more total asylum applications than Germany depite having an eighth of the population. Source for the numbers: Eurostat

Aug. 25th: The German Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) tweets this. It translates to: ""We are at present largely no longer enforcing #Dublin procedures for Syrian citizens."". This was actually not meant to be published, it was essentially just an assessment of the factual situation. Neither Merkel nor her office knew about this happening.

Sept. 3rd: The Federal Government publishes a statement that Dublin III still applies, despite what the previous tweet of the BAMF said. Link to the statement

Sept. 3rd: Hungary is stopping all trains en route to Germany. Refugees trying to make the journey by foot.

Sept. 5th: Orbán claims that the situation is no longer under control in a telephone conference with Merkel and Faymann. Germany and Austria agree on letting the trains leave Hungary, transit through Austria to Germany to relieve pressure. It is meant to be a one-time action. Merkels office announces that we will not reject the people coming here from Hungary.

Sept. 13: Germany reintroduces border controls.

What did Merkel actually say?

Probably the most repeated sentence of the whole crisis is Merkels 'We can do it'. It will be up to the historians of the future to evaluate whether this was actually true for the reality. The statement originates from Merkels annual summer press conference which was about a multitute of issues. I unfortunately could not find a full english transcript and it is way too long to translate it for this post, but I will translate the relevant passages.

Merkel: Most of us fortunately do not know the state of complete exhaustion, combined with fear for ones life or for the life of ones family. People that are coming here from Eritrea, Syria or Northern Iraq have to endure situations and fear that would let us collapse straight up. Therefore, when it comes to dealing with these people, we have to ensure that some core principles find application. These principles origniate from no lesser source than the Grundgesetz, our constitution.

First: The fundamental right of asylum applies to people that flee political persecution. We can be proud about the humanity of our constitution. This humanity especially finds expression in this article [the right of asylum]. We grant protection for all of thise that flee wars. They deserve protection as well.

The second principle is the human dignity of the individual. This is a core principle that article 1 of our constitution mandates us to follow [note: this article can not be changed]. No matter whether someone is a natural citizen or not, no matter why and from what country someone comes to us, no matter what prospects his application for asylum has - we will respect the human dignitiy of every human inside our borders and we will use the full force of the constitutional state against those that mob other people, that attack other people, that commit acts of arson against their accomodations or want to exercise violence. [...] There will be no tolerance towards those who question the human dignity of other humans. [...]

I will also say: Nevertheless, we still live in a good country. The state of the nation is good! The civil society, often mentioned, is reality here and I am proud and thankful to see how countless people in this country are reacting towards the arrival of refugees. The number of those that care for refugees in the current day, the number of people who give a helping hand dwarfs the number of the xenophobes and rabble-rousers. [...]

In the near future, we will implement new legislation that increases the speed of processing the applications. We need more capacity to house refugees. We need to be determine quickly who has a good chance to stay here and who doesn't. We have to make decisions quickly so that we can deport those who have been rejected quickly. [...]

I will just say: Germany is a strong country. The mentality that we have to apply to this issue has to be: We managed to do so much in the past - we will do this! We will do this, and whereever we meet obstacles in our way, we have to work to overcome them. The federal government will do all that is in its power to do this.

There then is the european dimension, and I think we are allowed to say: Europe as a whole has to move. The states have to share the responsibilities for refugees coming here. The universal civil rights have been closely connected to europe and its history. This was one of the main founding principles for the EU. Should europe fail to adress this crisis, this connection will break loose. [...]

There is little value in publically shifting the blame, but we have to say: the current situation is not satisfactory. The ministers of interor affairs will meet on sept. 14th. The heads of states are ready at all time. The topics are countries of safe origin, hotspots in italy and greece, a fair distribution. The topic will be quotas inside europe, that will not only take population into account but also economic strength. A little bit of fairness.

There is a third point that we have to consider: [Bring peace to Syria and surrounding countries, help these countries] [...]

Merkels statement ends here and is followed by a Q&amp;A

M: ""There is a high level of agreement that we need to relieve pressure from Italy. It is not possible to say that all refugees who arrive there have to stay in Italy just because they came via the mediterranian sea. The dublin agreement is not working like it used to because the circumstances have changed. As a result, it is important that every one of has to engage for europe and mutuality, then we will move forwards.""

[...]

M: I think it is fine that the V4 are holding meetings on the issue. There are meetings between Germany and France or Italy, I have no objections.

[...]

M: Concerning the question of Dublin III: Dublin III is the regulation that is in force, thus I greatly appreciate Hungary registering the refugees - something that not all countries are doing, one has to say; Hungary is doing this very well. I think it created a certain amount of confusion when we had an inner debate in Germany where several federal states stated that syrians have to be decided very quickly as pretty much all of them are genine refugees fleeing a war zone. The head of the Office for migration and refugees subsequently stated: Yes, syrians will be identified, afterwards they will have a very quick procedure to be accepted as a civil war refugee. This has resulted in the creation of the following impression: If a syrian comes to germany and can identify himself as syrian, he is welcome in Germany. This is in fact the reality, in the same way that someone from Kosovo most likely won't be allowed to stay. This has created the wrong assumption that all syrians should come to germany. This however is not the state of the law and we have already told this to the hungarian government which has to deal with the phenomen of syrians inside its borders saying ""let us go to Germany"". It is not the case that we could simply diverge from Dublin III, we don't have any other treaty on the issue. But if one country is building fences, a second country is allowing everyone to transit and a third country isn't registering everybody anymore, one has to say: If this state is the reality, we have to attempt to find a better one, a state where Law and Acting are in accordance again. But the legal basis for us and for the hungarian government is the one that is in force today [dublin III].

One of the main issues is that all that Merkel said on the issue has been reduced to a few sentences which fail to carry everything she said. Merkel is often quoted with very strong statements on this regard where her actual statements have been a lot more nuanced.

For example the salaries of  apple employees who work in shops selling finished apple products in France for example are much higher than those of Chinese assembly line workers and engineers overseeing production lines. Technically the store clerks/teams in the US or France are generating more value per hour because the finished batch of 100 iphones is being sold on their end for $800 a pop by a team of 20 people per week, while the Chinese team of 20 workers might have assembled 100 of them in a week for $50 a pop. 

This measure of productivity is very arbitrary and market dependent. It speaks little as to role and importance of said role in getting a finished good from random raw materials to a functional doodad. Apple even outsources its design teams now.

'Productivity' has nothing to do with 'hard working' in a globalized economy. However in the developed world Americans do work like pack mules, I know one that does 3 jobs in tandem and basically takes less than 5 days off per year. This is unthinkable in Europe.

False,IFreakinLovePi,,,[],,,,text,"I kept jumping around and adding points to various sections i wrote, so it might have wierd pacing, but here goes:

Well, first and foremost is the obvious thing: try to learn some basic German, or have a pocket dictionary or translation app. It seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how many soldiers come over there and don't bother. Yes, most Germans will probably speak better english than your German will ever be, but the effort is appreciated. Usually when a local will hear your broken German, they'll just switch to English for you. But if you walk up to someone speaking English, they'll often just pretend to not understand. Its basic, but it's still a surprisingly common issue. 

Germans might seem ""cold"" and distant to foreigners. Lots of people have resting bitch face. The new Yorker stereotype should come to mind. If your from the south or a rural area, it might seem rude, but it's not; everyone tends to mind their own business in town. It's also because Germans (and most Europeans in my experience) tend to reserve genuine kindness for people they actually care about and small talk is pretty rare. I've heard from lots of Americans that people feel really ""fake"" in their niceness once they get back to the states as a result. So don't be put off by the directness and supposed rudeness, it's just a façade. 

Kaiserslautern is in a valley, so it gets dark pretty early. There's a decent night life, but nothing crazy. It's a medium sized city. If you want a big city feel then go to Mannheim, it's only an hour away (two by train) and theres tonnes to do there. There's a cool castle ruin in Hoheneken (a ""village"" on the edge of town) and an medieval watchtower at the top of the mountain near Betzenberg (Humbergturm is it's name). 

German has these things called Wildparks. They're something like a zoo crossed with a nature preserve. There's no cost of entry because they're usually just plopped in the middle of the woods, so sometimes you'll just be hiking and you'll find walk into one. The enclosures can be pretty big, so there's a good chance you might not even see the animals from the side you're on. Speaking of animals, there are wild boars in the woods. They're pretty harmless, but if you see babies then just turn around and find another route (mother's get hyper aggressive and have been known to spend hours trying to uproot a tree that an unsuspecting person has climbed). If you stick to the trails and logging roads you'll probably never come across one. 

Learn how to use public transportation. Traffic and parking can be hell and Germans drive with a lot more aggressive confidence than most Americans; this may seem daunting, but Germans have a much more strenuous driver education program so you will likely be the one slowing things down. The train and bus systems are integrated, so if you have questions go to the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) and they information desk is generally very helpful, plus I've never seen one that didn't speak English. An open secret is the weekend pass train ticket. It basically lets you ride as many trains as you want anywhere in Germany for the weekend (restricted to the slower trains, though). Last I was there, it about 20 euro (the euro is fluctuates between $1.10-1.50). On another driving note, if the car you have in the U.S. isn't in top mechanical shape, there's a very good chance it won't pass TÜV, the German vehicle inspection agency, and might not be road legal. Lots of soldiers just grab lemon lot cars because they've usually already passed. If your car gives off lots of emissions (usually older cars), then it may not legally be able to get into certain city centres (you get a colour coded emissions sticker and there's usually signage to tell you). Avoid bringing a truck or SUV, the roads get pretty narrow in some places and you'll stick out like a sore thumb almost anywhere (something something opsec). If you're dead set in bringing your car, the TÜV guys used to be bribable when I was there with a carton (the big one with 20 packs) of Malboros or $50 on the passanger seat, I don't know if it's still the case. Oh, and you need to learnneuropean signage. Unlike the states, little is written in signs because the symbols are international and standardised across the EU and more. The bright side to this that it makes international travel a breeze. 

Speaking of sticking out, you will. Americans can be spotted from a mile away. I can't put my finger on why, but they do. The way you dress is a big part of it, if you don't want to be pegged everywhere you go, then don't buy your clothes at the BX/PX, get them off base. American English, as a language, has a lot unique sounds, specifically the ""A"" and ""R"" sounds, like in ""apple"" and ""car"" respectively, which sounds ""duck-like"" to Germans. This combined with the fact that the stresses in A. English pronunciations often fall on vowels, means that it's a bit jarring and sounds louder than it is. There's a very bad stereotype about Americans being loud and obnoxious, which, while not always true, will earn you a little bit of wrongful, and oft subtle, discrimination in some places. Try speaking softer than you normally would in public. Restaurants, trains, buses, and public areas are generally quieter than in the states. The first time I went out to eat in the US, it felt like a sporting event because it was so loud. 

Speaking of sports, soccer is huge in Germany. They often get close to winning the world cup every year. Kaiserslautern has it's own professional team. The stadium is in Betzenberg. Don't live there. In fact, avoid going out if you know there's a big game. If they lose, it's fine, but German have borderline riots when they win. It might have calmed down in recent years, but it's best to just stay out of trouble. You won't get hurt or anything, but you don't want to wind up having your picture in the news because you accidentally got caught up with the wrong group; I doubt your commander would appreciate it. 

You might be tempted to go to Paris while in Europe, because there's a TGV (bullet train) they goes there from Kaiserslautern. Don't. Paris sucks. As does much of France on the border. Best place in France is in the south, plus you can hop over to Italy and Switzerland from there. Be careful going to Amsterdam, CID watches out for American plates that cross that border, so be prepared for a piss test if you do. Czeck is probably the cheapest place for a vacation while there and you'll get the best bang for your buck. 

I suggest living off base of you really want to get immersed and have fun. It's easy to stay on because it's closer to work, but it's a lot harder to convince yourself to go out and experience everything around you. There are some people that say Germany sucked, but those people often never left post, which is incredibly boring. 

You might find that germans seem a lot nicer when you get further away from bases. This is because young soldiers can be idiots and being in a foreign country doesn't change that. And oftentimes this is the first impression that many Germans get from Americans. Further away, they're knowledge of Americans is limited to what we saw on sitcoms that he been dubbed. 

Try to get out every weekend if you can, there's a lot to experience. 

Let me know if you want any clarification or if you have any other questions. I don't know your hobbies or what you enjoy, so I tried to be as general as possible.

There have been dozens of RCT's showing no real difference between a low GI and high GI diet.

&gt;As I mentioned I'm not interested in RCTs of obese people. I am more concern about Asian populations and what works for my country. At this point we are reducing sugar intake.

Then why are we even talking? Most of the literature I read is U.S. or European. We even have sugar RCTs showing people on a very high sugar diet which doesn't harm them in any way. Not to mention sugar isn't even high GI.

&gt;As for RCT, our local scientists has done a fantastic one on healthy male Chinese population, further proving a low GI diet is better.

That literally doesn't prove anything. People ate less glucose so they had lower Glucose AUC and lower variability? That doesn't matter.

&gt;Eh why not? The hallmark of PCOS is insulin resistance. There wasn't any point for me to reduce weight since I was already thin. My insulin resistance was reversed when I went on a low carb low GI diet. You think I didn't try the other way with high carb 1400 calorie diet when rice is a staple in my country? Didn't work, I wished it did because life would be easier.

Because it is a confound. What might be good for someone with PCOS isn't necessarily good for someone without PCOS. PCOS is also usually a result of hormone imbalances, not diet, but diet can help with it.

&gt;I take blood tests every 6 month to monitor and so far HOMA-IR lists me as insulin sensitive. Ensuring that I have a constant low insulin was the only way that my symptoms disappeared.

Anecdotes don't mean anything especially when nothing is controlled.

&gt;Long grain white rice is also better than short grain when it comes to how it spikes blood sugar - a rise in sugar levels causes the pancreas to produce more insulin, and frequent spikes can lead to diabetes.

I have worked in the leather industry most of my life, as a cobbler and as a consultant for some shoe brands but that was back in Europe. 
I worked closely with shoe factories back in Portugal, Spain, Italy, also worked with tanneries and I just never heard people using these terms as a grading system, even when we were communicating in English. Just saying that sounds so weird to me, it's a complete misunderstanding of what the words actually mean. 
I really have the feeling that this is an American thing only, don't you think? It might also be happening in the UK, but I don't really remember that being the case when I lived there for a little while. (Well, it was a long time ago). 

There is just one thing I would like to mention, when you said:
&gt; 1)Look for a small ""craftsman"" or if you pick a ""bigger brand"" pick one with a solid long-standing rep when it comes to leather/quality. Avoid ""huge"" multi-national brands that make everything from suits to jeans to shoes...because they're not actually making any of those items; all the work is contracted out and who's making what may vary (as will the quality) from year to year (like all ""fast fashion"" they'll pick the cheapest quote at the moment). This is the reason why all the Tommy, Kenneth Cole, Fossil, etc wallets look the same. Avoid websites that look like somebody had a cool idea for a brand name and a logo and farmed out the actual work...a slightly less flashy website is likely to yield somebody spends more time on craftsmanship than marketing.

You are right, however I just want to point out something specific to the shoe industry. Shoe factories making good quality leather shoes are not really common, I probably visited most of the European ones. You are also right when you say that multi-national brands use contractors and sometimes they pick the cheapest one but fortunately it's not always the case. For example, Brooks Brothers had some of its shoes made by the Zarco factory in Portugal. In term of quality and quantity it's probably one of the 5 best factories in Europe. Also, some countries are really improving. India for example is starting to produce some pretty good shoes (on par with some of the European brands sometimes). So I wouldn't necessarily discard a brand because of its multi-national status or because of the manufacturing country, but that's probably an advice for the folks who already have a bit of background and know how to recognise good quality leather/shoes.

False,cockwomblez,,,[],,,,text,"&gt; He is well known to have hated the spitzenkandidat method due to it stripping away powers from the Council

Yes, the point of the spitzenkandidaten was to connect the election of the Commission President - the executive, to the election of the EU parliament. Previously this was done behind closed doors and the choice was disconnected from the results of the EU parliamentary elections.

&gt; having a shaky basis in EU law at that point

Not really, the Lisbon treaty amended the text of the treaties so that Article 17.7 TEU read  the Commission candidate ""shall be **elected** by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members"", whereas previously Article 214 TEC (under the Nice reforms) had merely stipulated ""approved"".  

Not only is there not another way to signify that the European Parliament ""elects"" the head of the executive, rather than merely ""approves"" other than a process like the Spitzenkandiaten reforms, the language used in the Constitutional Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conferences for the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty make clear that the Commission President should be the result of an open race linked to the EU parliamentary elections.

&gt; No it is down to a plurality in the European Parliament. 

No it is not. The Spitzenkandidaten process merely stipulates that the party with a plurality **has the first attempt** of being nominated by the Council and then elected by the European Parliament by a majority of its members. If no majority exists in the EU parliament, then the Council has 1 month, under treaty rules, to propose a new candidate. If it is clear that the spitzenkandiaten from the party with a plurarity is not going to get a majority then the Council does not even have to bother nominating them, and can go to the next largest party, etc. The spitzenkandiaten process would indicate that the Council would go exhaustively through the ""lead candidate"" choices of each Europarty until a majority is found in the parliament. This is EXACTLY analogous to how almost all parliamentary systems work, particularly Germany and states with PR legislatures that are used to having no party with a majority. The opposition to the Spitzenkanidaten process was a rearguard action from certain governments/figures trying to reopen a settled question.

&gt; Bommeleeër scandal

The Bommeleeër scandal isn't a scandal. I don't know what you know about it, but its essentially got more of the aurau of an urban myth/legend, involving several bomb hoaxes in Luxembourg in the 80's - which as far as I know Juncker isn't linked to.

&gt; the illegal wire tapping scandal

Yes, his chief of his intelligence service illegaly recorded meetings with Juncker and several other prominent Luxembourgers over a decade, and Juncker was accused of not having enough supervision over what they were getting up to.

&gt;  largely unknown outside of his own country.

Every EU politician is unknown in the UK. The UK doesn't report EU politics. There was a series of pan-EU televised debates for the election of the Commission President, but as you know, the UK parties stayed quiet about it, and UK media didn't report or show these on prime-live spots if at all.

&gt; federalist

Ohhh. Scary, the ""F"" word. Though, that is a legitimate reason for Cameron to oppose him, yes.

&gt; not just the spitzenkandidat process.

And he might have had more support if he hadn't framed it under opposition to a process that many saw as a breath of fresh air. Indeed, other leaders almost supported him until their own domestic national parties said they didn't want to undermine their colleagues in the European Parliament. If say, the ACER, the Europarty of the UK conservatives had proposed a candidate rather than fighting a rear guard action and sulking in the corner, they might have been able to frame it as compromise or ""modernisation"" candidate.


Edit: Oh, and lastly, the spitzekandiaten process in no way ""breaches the principle of subsidiarity"", I don't think you understand what  subsidiarity is. It's the principle of taking actions at the lowest level of governance unless justified. It is, in fact, a principle that worked its way into the treaties thanks to federalists, you may be shocked to hear. It is a federalist principle.

&gt; RIGA, Latvia - When the U.S. hit North Korea with sanctions last year, Pyongyang&amp;#039;s state-owned banks found a quiet backchannel to keep money flowing to the country&amp;#039;s ballistic missile programs, the U.S. says: the tiny European country of Latvia.

&gt; Latvia has come into focus as a potential weak link in the West&amp;#039;s banking system as the U.S. and EU increasingly rely on financial sanctions as a weapon in their diplomatic spats - with North Korea, but also Russia and Syria, among others.

&gt; Another complicating factor in Latvia&amp;#039;s bid to clean up its image is that the official in charge of detailing to the U.S. how Latvia is fighting financial crime has a history of working for banks that engaged in money-laundering.

&gt; BERLIN - The U.S. military has held preliminary discussions about moving a powerful missile defense system to Germany to boost European defenses, according to two sources familiar with the issue, a move that experts said could trigger fresh tensions with Moscow.

&gt; The tentative proposal to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Europe predates U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, and comes amid a broader push to strengthen Europe&amp;#039;s air and missile defenses.

&gt; Deploying another U.S. defensive system to Europe could reassure NATO allies in southern Europe already within striking range of Iran&amp;#039;s missiles, said one military official from that region.

False,ripinpeppers,,,[],,,,text,"There will always be a difference between what a person's ideals are (their religion, or the things they aspire to), the things they say (or write), and they things they do. It may be naive, but I take the writings that I listed at face value and try to look for the same in the people that I vote for. Jefferson had a complicated history, but I don't think its 100% fair to hold people in the past to the values we have today. Yes the 3/5ths compromise is one of the most disgusting politically expediant things to have happen in the history of the US, but the country indisputably improved as time goes on. Millions of Americans have died to free oppressed people around the world - again, sometimes shitty wars have also been fought, but at one point half of the United States went to war with the other half because they wouldn't let them keep owning other people as property (no matter what the South says, the civil war was about slavery. And there were abolitionists who went to war *explicitly* to free the slaves.) Our views change as time goes on. I would say, forgive the people in the past for the awful shit they did if their descendants fight to undo the injustice because of what they wrote. Don't forget what they did, but don't tear down the statue of a person like Lincoln or Jefferson just because they had some skeletons in the closet.

There are plenty of problems in the world right now but, for humanity in general, I think we are much better off in 2018 with the US around than if we had never declared independence and a separate timeline sprang off in 1776. The ideals espoused in those foundational documents (personal freedom and liberty are paramount) are what I think we should aspire to... that's why I included the Gettysburg Address along with those other papers, because although Lincoln originally believed *what was being taught in Universities at the time*, (that Africans were somehow different biologically to Europeans,) his views evolved and he ended up freeing the slaves. Personal freedom and liberty is the ideal that freed the slaves, gave the right to vote to everyone, equalized marriage rights, etc. 

If you look at the history of the United States compared to any other nation state in the history of planet earth, we have liberated more peoples (civil war, WW1, WW2) emancipated more peoples (civil war, WW2, Cold War) and given more freedom (sufferage, civil rights, gay rights, personal liberties) to more people than any other nation. If you disagree with that, please give another country that has done more? Great Britain probably comes closest but they were far more of an imperialist empire in their past than the US ever was, and if it weren't for Woodrow Wilson and FDR they probably could still be an empire. So if you apply the historical relativism principle equally then the US is by far the best on that front. We haven't done it alone, it hasn't always been perfect, and it hasn't always applied to everyone equally, but I think the structures and institutions of the United States allow for positive change for personal liberty and freedom in a way that isn't guaranteed like it is in the Bill of Rights and other US founding documents. If we didn't live up to the ideal of ""all men are created equal"" when the United States was founded, then we certainly are doing a better job of that now. ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others"" because up until the 20th century every government on Earth, including the US, was unbelievably oppressive by today's standards.

False,Zeuvembie,,,[],,,,text,"There exist in our history terrible evils. The Holocaust, the Trail of Tears, the Rape of Nanking, the Rwandan Genocide - the scope and terribleness of which it is almost impossible to convey, because individual lives disappear in a tumult of statistics. And they are, without exception, very *human* evils. Whatever your belief system, whatever the context for the events, these are not instances of supernatural horror or divine judgement. Hitler did not destroy Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, and Satan did not sign the orders that sent millions of European Jews, homosexuals, Roma, etc. to concentration camps, or forcibly relocate Native Americans thousands of miles to reservations. These are events which are solely and uniquely outside the realm of fantasy; they are the stark and terrible reality which we still deal with today.

Speculative fiction breaches the rules of what is known. Sometimes the writer(s) create an entirely new world, populated with people that have never and will never exist, that follows different rules - however familiar some aspects of their lives might be, they are at best parallels and allegories. Hitler-analogues may appear in these worlds alongside Christ-parallels. For every White Witch there may be a lion.

Other stories are set in a world like our own - one with a similar history, albeit with some fantastical elements. This is the realm of Harry Potter, and the DC and Marvel universes. Worlds which are recognizable as our own, but with something more or different. And the inclusion of some fantastic element in such a setting *does* impact the world, or it should, if the world is built worth a damn. Because readers ask questions; they theorize, extrapolate, and sometimes calculate. And sometimes those questions are hard to answer.

Because from a narrative viewpoint, the reason to use the world we know is *because* we know it, to draw from the common-day a realism and verisimilitude which would be difficult to manufacture from scratch, unless you're a Tolkien who enjoys nothing more than crafting new languages and drawing maps and weaving a story around them to fit. And that means that your world cannot differ *too much* from what is known...but it also tends to equip certain individuals with the ability to affect greater change on the world than normal. And that, in itself, causes the issue you've noticed.

Why did the Holocaust happen in Harry Potter? J. K. Rowling has never answered this; maybe she never will. We can only speculate. In many settings, such as the DC and Marvel universe, it is required that World War II unfold largely as it did because otherwise the world would diverge too much from the one we know - so they make excuses. Hitler had the Spear of Destiny, which prevented DC's heroes from engaging the Nazis directly, instead dealing largely with spies and saboteurs at home; or Hitler was the target of multiple occult forces, but superfolk were too rare and few to much affect the course of the war - and it is thanks to Allied groups like Captain America and the Invaders that the Nazi's efforts to utilize their unusual assets more thoroughly were thwarted.

Yet there is one more key that is common to most of these settings - the preservation of these horrors as a uniquely *human* evil. The Trail of Tears did not happen because a black magician mind-controlled Andrew Jackson so he could complete his infernal pact and gain immortality; the Rwandan genocide was not the result of aliens psychically possessing child soldiers in a botched invasion attempt.

False,ambrofelipe,,,[],,,,text,"&gt;O governo gasta muito em juros porque gasta mais do que arrecada em impostos.

Infelizmente fizeram o favor de derrubar a atividade produtiva e, assim, a arrecadação. Sim, isso fez com que o orçamento público fosse estrangulado. Mas nossa catástrofe do estrangulamento do orçamento vem de muito antes, desde os anos de superávit. O governo gasta muito em juros porque a taxa de juros é mantida ridiculamente alta.

&gt;Não faz pouco tempo que a Dilma tentou forçar uma queda de juros e o resultado foi inflação. 

Toda a política econômica de Levy (blergh) foi de elevar juros, que chegou a 14.25% numa tentativa frustrada de controlar a inflação. Não foi isso que aconteceu?

Enfim, inflação ocorre quando a demanda e o crédito disponível são maiores que a capacidade produtiva. Isso leva muita gente às compras sem que a produção consiga suprir. Daí isso leva os preços a se elevarem pra dissuadir a demanda. Isso não é verdade? Então o Brasil, em plena recessão, com produto sobrando porque ninguém compra, tem uma inflação, mas ela não é de demanda, certo?

O Brasil não tem uma inflação de demanda, mas sim uma inflação de câmbio. Como você disse, o dólar sobe e por isso os produtos brasileiros importados sobem (trigo, combustíveis, remédios, tecnologias) e isso faz com que os preços de outros produtos e serviços também aumentem. Aqui estamos.

Pois bem. Baixar a taxa de juros faz com que as pessoas tenham mais acesso a crédito. Em outras palavras, faz com que o dinheiro fique mais barato. Assim, mais pessoas vão às compras, a demanda sobe e isso aumentaria uma inflação de demanda. De modo parecido, elevar a taxa de juros diminui o acesso das pessoas ao crédito, esfria a demanda e faz com que a inflação de demanda diminua. Certo?

Então, como abaixar a taxa de juros vai fazer diferença na inflação que não é causada pela demanda, mas sim pela alta do câmbio? Não faz.

&gt; Agora, porque o juros é alto?

Lobby de banco, no caso atual. É pura e simplesmente transferência de renda de quem trabalha e paga impostos para quem vive de rentismo sem pagar impostos. Simples assim. 

&gt;É alto porque poucos emprestariam pra um país que não consegue arrecadar o suficiente pra pagar as contas e receber pouco retorno por isso.

Então nós concordamos. Veja no que estamos concordando: o poder público, por meio do Banco Central, mantem a taxa de juros elevada mesmo que isso não tenha poder sobre a inflação. Os nossos governantes deliberadamente seguram a taxa de juros alta de forma que o Itaú cresceu, em pleno ano de crise, 12%. Quem mais cresceu 12% ano passado?

Isso nos leva a observar melhor a forma como o Banco Central emite títulos da dívida pública. Se a gente concorda que há corrupção na saúde, na educação, nos transportes, na infra-estrutura, na previdência, será que é absurdo imaginar que há corrupção na maior fatia do orçamento público? Não é, há muito roubo feito descaradamente.

Então, precisamos mesmo continuar com esse perfil de amortização e rolamento da dívida? Com esse perfil de juros? Você acha mesmo que se o Brasil quebrar esse ciclo, o Itaú vai fechar as portas e abandonar o país?

&gt;o problema é que pro estado reduzir a desigualdade ele aumenta a pobreza

Aqui, eu vou julgar que você digitou errado ou tomou um chá de cogumelos.

&gt;O que gera crescimento é investimento.

No mais, você se esqueceu de uma coisa só, da qual a gente já conversou: a saída, no momento, não é retomar a receita pública? Ao tirar dinheiro que vai pra banqueiro sem arrecadação e, ao invés disso, inserir na economia na forma de outros tipos de investimento, o que entra pro bolso do seu Zé arrecada e o que sai do bolso do seu Zé também arrecada. No caminho, seu Zé gera emprego, e arrecada mais.

Se o seu Zé conseguir fazer uma poupancinha, ele tem duas opções com o dinheiro dele: colocar pra render em títulos da dívida pública ou fazer uma reforma na padaria. Quiçá, abrir outra padaria. Pronto, fomentou-se a iniciativa privada, fez-se investimento e verificou-se crescimento.

Nenhuma grande economia no mundo - veja que argumento ousado, o meu - NENHUMA grande economia do mundo chegou lá sem massivo investimento público a pretexto da indústria, da saúde, de investimento militar, etc. A nossa saída, portanto, é inserir dinheiro na economia que reduza a desigualdade, aumentando a receita pública. Além disso, aumentar o investimento que desenvolva a indústria nacional.

Isso deveria ser bem claro pra você, que parou pra aprender economia. Espero que não tenha sido no mises.org.

Getting that money out is a massive pain. I've placed two orders on behalf of people at purse.io. One's already been shipped and I got paid in BTC. The other had a shipping problem - five items were shipped instead of six, and I have no idea when the sixth will ship. I don't get paid until the order is received in full.

I've created an account at Coinbase so I can exchange BTC into real currency, and have it transferred to my bank account. I've not done that yet, but it seems to be a good way to cash out on BTC.

The problem I have with purse.io is that it takes 2-3 weeks to pay out, given how long it takes to ship stuff. On one of my orders I had to pay $5 extra for shipping - I've cancelled a number of other purse.io transactions even before placing an order, as often neither shipping, nor taxes are included in whatever the purse.io buyer wants to pay. On that $100 order that was another 5% down the drain.

Oh, and the BTC rate on purse.io is atrocious. They attract buyers that want to spend their BTC by giving 15-25-30 percent discounts on Amazon. Guess who pays for the difference? That's right, I do, when I place their order. So that's already a quarter to a third of my money down the drain. That really hurts - to the point that I might give up on purse.io altogether.

I don't plan on buying from Amazon US directly for the same reason as you: high shipping fees, customs, and I live in a country with the highest VAT rate in the world. I can buy stuff on the high street for less than from Amazon US with all those add-on costs.

Though these things are hard to quantify, it's probably like picking up one Romance language if you already know another. But more like Spanish and French than Spanish and Portuguese. Similar but not *that* similar. Linguistically, Hebrew and Arabic are near neighbors. You'll have it way easier than someone starting with only an Indo-European language.

False,DOHDDY,,,[],,,,text,"***EDIT:*** just leaving this here, I just discovered that the twoway line graph has an option called connect() where one can specify a connectstyle that can be stepstair or stairstep. That means the first solution might work just as well. Also instead of putting the if statement in the predict command the regions can be separated with if statements in the twoway plot command by simply appending 3 line graphs each with an if together. In that case one can also use the ""sort"" option instead of the gsort command.  
____

There are multiple ways of achieving this. The easiest way is to simply run the regression mentioned in the title and then use the predict command to generate your estimated values separate for each group with the ""if"" option. Then you simply plot them with ""twoway line values_group1 values_group2 .... Age"".  
Colors and line patterns can be adjusted with the lp() and lc() options. And there is quite a bit of legend manipulation to be done as well. 

What you need to keep in mind is that if you don't have data points close to the jump of this function you will get a weird slope. To avoid this you can do the graph with the ""twoway function"" command but it is a bit more complex. 
Alternatively, your lecturer might use some user built ado for that bit I am not aware of one that does this for you. 
___
 Here an example with a standard dataset.  

    sysuse lifeexp.dta
    //we generate a new categorical variable similar to age group
    gen gnp2 = (gnppc&gt;1360) + (gnppc&gt;3360) + (gnppc&gt;14100)  
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2  
    predict l_eu if region ==1
    predict l_na if region ==2
    predict l_sa if region ==3
    //now we need to make sure that the data is sorted first by region and then by gnppc from small to big; otherwise you'd get lines all over the place  
    gsort region -gnppc  
    //plot data, with different line patterns, adjusted legend and y axis title
    line  l_na l_eu l_sa gnppc, lp(solid dash longdash) legend(lab(1 ""N.A."") lab(2 ""E.U. Asia"") lab(3 ""S.A."") ring(0)) yti(""Estimated life expectancy"")

Now you see that there are some weird slopes in there. Some regions also have no values for certain levels of  gnp. If that is what you need you are done. If you want to visualise the function there is a different method. What this one comes down to is basically plugging enough values for gnppc in the regression formula until the graph smooths out. 
So let's do the same with twoway function:  

    sysuse lifeexp.dta
    //we generate a new categorical variable similar to age group
    gen gnp2 = (gnppc&gt;1360) + (gnppc&gt;3360) + (gnppc&gt;14100)  
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2, coefl
    twoway function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons], range(gnppc) lp(solid)  || function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[1.region] , range(gnppc) lp(dash) || function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[3.region] , range(gnppc) lp(longdash)||, xti(""GNP per capita"") yti(""Estimated life expectancy at birth"") legend(label(1 ""North America"") label( 2 ""EU &amp; Asia"" )  label( 3 ""South America"" ) ring(0))

So these are actually 3 twoway functions appended. I'll explain one of them the rest just work the same.  
function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[1.region] , range(gnppc)  
simply put it takes the estimated coefficients from the regression - the ""_b[whatever]"" (you can see how to access those if you run the regression with the coeflegend option) and multiplies them with a condition statement in parenthesis. ""x"" refers to gnppc, so (x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) simply evaluates to 1 if the value of gnppc is between 1360 and 3360 and otherwise it is 0. This simply means that only the coefficient where the conditional statement evaluates to 1 actually counts towards our function. Then we add the constant term and the term for the region we are interested in. Lastly, we define what ""x"" means with the range option. It automatically checks what the min and max values are and then generates 300 equally stepped values for x (you can specify more if necessary).

I've yet to find a series with an EU that isn't mainly junk. It's all like, really niche stuff.

Native Americans in North and South-America. Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Never forget any of those, just because there are no movies about them!)

from Wikipedia about Hiroshima and Nagasaki:
""Frequent estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, though the number which died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. ""

And in the aftermath there was rise in cancer deaths and other health issues. Nobody knows how many, that can easily be several 100 thousands that at least suffered in the aftermath.

Seriously that's what the entire first half of your argument sounds like. 

&gt;It doesn't matter how cool or unique a power transfer mechanic is, people will always go for the most boring one.

There is a buttload of modpacks out there that discourage the use to the simplest way, just look at all of the HQM packs. I regularly see people showing off their Rube Goldberg-esque builds.

If someone want's magic cables for your mod, they will get them, people who want to go the easy route will find a way. Maybe that means downloading a ""MagicCable for BordListian' Mod"" Mod but it will exist and it will be used.

However by creating compatibility between the big mods with actually interesting features you might get to see an IC2 nuclear reactor powering a BC quarry.

&gt;Passive Generation is useful

yes it is, and excluding it as a viable method of generation, because it is lazy, is just stupid. That's like saying food is dumb noone is allowed to use it in a mod. I too am no fan of 500k RF/t passive generation, that's why I don't use them. 

OP mods will always exist. And cutting yourself of from collaboration with other quality mods stops noone from creating op items for your mod.

All this does, is hurt your mod and the people who want to play with it.

I too don't want Forge Energy as the official name for MC electricity, because yes, it sounds stupid. But why not RF or MJ those are actually cool names.

Finally:  let me research EU and MJ, I am not sure what distinctions there are. I know they both have ""voltage"" in the form of units/tick.

Edit: Yea, so the only gameplay difference of EU/MJ to RF is the 'voltage' Which should be absolutely no problem to simulate in the FE environment by monitoring FE/t.

* Our first Capital was Salvador, then Rio, and now it's Brasilia
* We are named after a tree (Pau-Brasil). It was heavily extracted by portuguese because of its red color (Brasa is portuguese for 'burning coal')

* Feijoada (beans with pork meat)
* Pão de queijo ('cheese-bread')  
* Guaraná (soft drink)
* Brigadeiro (a chocolate candy)
* Açaí (kinda like ice cream)
* Acarajé (a fried ""ball"", usually stuffed with shrimp)

&gt; My fellow Americans:
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; This week, as we prepared for Thanksgiving, Canada held an important election, and I'm pleased to again send my congratulations to Prime Minister Mulroney. One of the important issues in the Canadian election was trade. And like our own citizens earlier this month, our neighbors have sent a strong message, rejecting protectionism and reaffirming that more trade, not less, is the wave of the future.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. In 1776 our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, charging the British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote, ``cutting off our trade with all parts of the world,'' end quote.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; And that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched another revolution with a book entitled ``The Wealth of Nations,'' which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism. Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; America's most recent experiment with protectionism was a disaster for the working men and women of this country. When Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930, we were told that it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in this country -- the same line we hear today. The actual result was the Great Depression, the worst economic catastrophe in our history; one out of four Americans were thrown out of work. Two years later, when I cast my first ballot for President, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who opposed protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent years, the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined. The record is clear that when America's total trade has increased, American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has declined, so have the number of jobs.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Yet today protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies -- countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends -- weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; After the Second World War, America led the way to dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth. And in one week, when important multilateral trade talks are held in Montreal, we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system. We want to open more markets for our products, to see to it that all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas as dispute resolution and agriculture. We also want to bring the benefits of free trade to new areas, including services, investment, and the protection of intellectual property. Our negotiators will be working hard for all of us.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, back in 1776, our Founding Fathers believed that free trade was worth fighting for. And we can celebrate their victory because today trade is at the core of the alliance that secure the peace and guarantee our freedom; it is the source of our prosperity and the path to an even brighter future for America.

When Muhammad gained power and conquered Mecca, he smashed the idols and ended their religion.

They effectively ended Zoroastrianism in Persia by sword and blood, by destroying their temples and killing their priests. When they moved to places like modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, India etc. they invaded the temples there and demolished the religions they saw as ""mushrik"" or Pagan. Those religions, the priests of those religions claimed they had the truth, but they got annihilated. If Frank army didn't stop Muslim invaders at Europe, they would've conquered all the way to Rome and probably killed the pope and destroyed the Christianity.

The author appears to be demonstrating the different attitudes towards church and religion in Europe and America, and how important church communities are to many Americans. I don't get the sense that they have an agenda to prove atheists aren't really atheists at all, personally. When they refer to ""Nones"", they're referring to not only atheists, but also anyone who doesn't practice organized religion, which includes many who still believe in a god, just not God™.

False,blackmagic70,,,[],,,,text,"A FURORE erupted in Britain in April when the effect of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy on Caribbean migrants who came to Britain after the second world war was revealed. Well before the scandal broke, the British Library had been finalising an exhibition to explore the experiences of the “Windrush generation” 70 years after their arrival in London. Titled “Windrush: Songs in a Strange Land”, the exhibition, which opens on June 1st, will focus on political, literary and musical voices from the Caribbean, revisiting colonialism through the stories of people who experienced it. It prompts questions about how people from the former empire have in turn shaped Britain. 

This is part of a broader movement in the visual arts. Calls to revisit historical narratives in museums to make room for the perspectives of those who were colonised have grown louder in recent years. Groups of activists seek to identify the Western bias involved in cultural heritage and shame institutions into redressing it. As such, the activists ask provocative questions about who owns culture.

These debates spurred a group of young museum professionals from different minority and immigrant groups to form Museum Detox in 2016. Their aim is to build awareness around diversity in cultural organisations, to build a network and to help members achieve leadership positions. Their inaugural event, in October that year, was a flash mob at the Museum of London. It saw some 60 black and minority-ethnic museum workers disrupt “Punk.London”, an exhibition marking 40 years of punk and its legacy. The flash mob fittingly caused anarchy by raiding the show with cards and texts about African and Caribbean culture. By linking the artefacts with personal stories and facts about migration, Museum Detox offered an alternative view of the collection.

The previous day gal-dem, a collective of ethnic-minority women, had also staged a cultural coup at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Commandeering Friday Late, the museum’s monthly contemporary-arts series, they encouraged visitors to take alternative tours of the galleries. Rather than seeing the European artefacts and sculptures that dominate its main collections and the vast halls of its Cast Courts, they would focus on black and Middle Eastern women’s performances, histories and objects. The idea was that these should be central, not peripheral, to a museum visit. 

Activists argue that museums are not solely concerned with art and design: they also make statements about identity and belonging in their countries. In February the British Museum, in collaboration with the BBC’s reprised “Civilisations” series, hosted lectures on the topic; curators talked candidly about the difficult provenance of their collections and how to present it to the public. In the original 1960s television series, Kenneth Clark, a celebrated art historian, travelled through Europe feting Western art. This time, three presenters explored the arts of Africa, Asia and the Americas as rich civilisations that can stand with the Greeks and the Romans. Mary Beard, a celebrated classicist, considered perspective: through design histories from Mexico and Greece to Egypt and China, she focused on the human body as a way of framing the discussion of what is considered “civilised”.

Scrutiny of the canon is extending to universities, too. Non-Western academics and thinkers are sharing their “decolonising syllabi” and discussing the subject online. Last year undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge petitioned to diversify their English-literature curriculum with non-Western voices. At Cambridge, in an open letter to the head of the English faculty, students said they want to change a syllabus which they feel “elevates white male authors at the expense of all others”. They stated that while strides had been made to include women writers, “the curriculum, taken as a whole, risks perpetuating institutional racism.” Students suggested more post-colonial authors in exam papers, more diversified speakers at the university and “a zero-tolerance policy on the dismissal of race as a subject worthy of discussion/enquiry in essays”. The faculty have entered into discussions with the students to address their concerns. 

While museums may not be moving towards total decolonisation and returning artworks and artefacts to their country of origin, activists’ pressure can push institutions to be more transparent about provenance. Curators could likewise encourage more nuanced interpretations of collections by juxtaposing canonical works, where appropriate, with artefacts and ephemera. A more diverse workforce may help to deliver those new ideas and approaches. That will be to museums’ benefit. As the Windrush scandal has proven, the story of British colonialism is still being told.

Du coup les anglophones de naissance sont avantagés dans plein de domaines par rapport à ceux qui pratiquent d'autres langues. C'est pareil pour le français.

En europe par exemple, l'angleterre gagne des milliards grâce à ça, et tous les autres pays d'europe dépensent des milliards pour pouvoir apprendre l'anglais à leur population.

it blew up the deficit, taxed grad students unreasonable amounts while letting private jets go free, and I'm already bored talking about it. As for the first part I do believe their credit for it was restricted, but also that they put more effort into getting it passed.

Il resto è comunque costretto a confrontarsi con della competizione che ha a disposizione lo stesso accesso agli strumenti che hanno gli attuali vincitori. Era più pericoloso Berlusconi quando aveva il controllo delle televisioni in un periodo pre-internet in tal senso.

Il problema è che, in realtà, per la ""Bubble Democracy"", è più probabile che persone che la pensano allo stesso modo entrino in contatto tra loro, si informino dalle stesse fonti e così via. Nel momento in cui una buona parte della popolazione segue questi due schieramenti e contemporaneamente disdegna i mezzi di informazioni tradizionali come ""strumenti del sistema"", per quanto si possano riportare fatti questi li negheranno e li vedranno come un modo per infangare e destabilizzare il movimento a cui sentono di appartenere.
Paradossalmente, con Berlusconi la situazione era migliore (o meno peggio) perché metà del paese gli si era compattata contro. In questo caso, metà paese si è compattata dentro a questi due movimenti, mentre l'altra metà è fratturata in maniera (temo) insanabile nel breve periodo.

&gt; Per Leone parliamo del periodo dell'assassinio di Moro, per la cui gestione fu pesantemente criticato, e dello scandalo Lockheed. Parliamo di periodo abbastanza caldo politicamente, e in cui la stabilità dell'impianto statale era tutto fuorché scontata.
Cossiga fu presidente nel periodo in cui, con la fine della Guerra Fredda, gli USA tolsero il supporto incondizionato alle forze anti-comuniste in Italia e le indagini di Falcone e sua morte, altro periodo che definirei tutt'altro che stabile, probabilmente più di quello attuale.
Oggi abbiamo sicuramente una crisi del sistema partitico, ma non vedo quello istituzionale in particolare difficoltà: le richieste dei 5 stelle sono per un sistema più vicino al presidenziale o quantomeno con più controllo da parte dell'elettorato sul lavoro delle istituzioni (si parlava addirittura di qualche forma di vincolo di mandato), non di abbattere il sistema intero.

Guarda, per gli studi che ho fatto posso dirti con un certo grado di sicurezza che siamo messi peggio adesso che in entrambi i casi precedenti. Nel caso di Leone:

- Il sistema partitico era ancora molto forte
- La posizione dell'Italia nel blocco occidentale garantiva stabilità (seppur eteroguidata per ragioni di Guerra Fredda)
- Il sistema istituzionale era ancora giovane ed adatto a quella realtà.

Nel caso di Cossiga, invece:

- Il sistema partitico (seppur entrato nella fase iniziale della sua crisi) era ancora forte.
- L'apertura ai post-comunisti non ha creato instabilità perché il processo in Italia era già iniziato quando Berlinguer teorizzò l'Eurocomunismo e iniziò a metterlo in pratica.
- Il sistema istituzionale iniziava a mostrare i primi segni di fatica, ma si adattava ancora alla realtà politico-partitica di quegli anni.

Oggi, invece:

- Il sistema partitico è palesemente in crisi
- Forze populiste hanno la maggioranza e stanno governando da sole (perché non c'è un partner più moderato. E penso sia il primo caso per un paese dell'Europa occidentale)
- Il sistema istituzionale ormai è vetusto e non più adatto alla realtà politica che dovrebbe regolare. E questo è problematico perché sta dimostrando tutti i suoi limiti (così come lo fece in occasione della seconda elezione di Napolitano e tutto quello che ne conseguì).

Da analista politico (e avendoci scritto sopra una tesi), posso garantirti che il sistema politico-istituzionale più instabile è quello che in questo momento abbiamo tra le mani: un sistema parlamentare con una legge elettorale fondamentalmente proporzionale in cui i partiti sono deboli. Tutti gli ingredienti per il disastro ci sono (e paradossalmente, una riforma in senso presidenziale sarebbe particolarmente rischiosa in un momento come quello attuale).

&gt; Quanto alle soluzioni odierne, basta dare un occhio al vicino d'oltralpe che più ci rassomiglia: in Francia, che soffre della nostra stessa storica sfiducia nelle istituzioni e paralisi da costante protesta di tutti contro tutti, Macron è riuscito a raccogliere la maggioranza dietro di sè creando un'offerta che mescola idee che si sarebbero descritte come sia di destra che di sinistra, e la solita resistenza al cambiamento, impersonata dagli scioperi paralizzanti, non ha più il supporto della maggioranza della popolazione che in passato aveva.

E su questo, purtroppo, non posso essere assolutamente d'accordo. Quella di Macron è una ""Terza Via 2.0"" che ha mirato a raccogliere intorno a sé l'elettorato moderato. Sappiamo tutti però che i risultati della ""Terza Via"" per quanto efficaci nel breve periodo, sul medio lungo facciano più male che bene. Specialmente se guardiamo alla realtà europea, dove è passata la ""Terza Via"", si è creato il vuoto dopo.
Tra l'altro, se Macron si dovesse bruciare (cosa non così improbabile) non ci sarebbe un altro leader pronto a raccogliere il testimone e quindi le due forze che avrebbero buone probabilità di arrivare al ballottaggio sarebbero (paradossalmente) la sinistra radicale e la destra radicale.

Su tutto il discorso regionale (che non sto a quotare per comodità) sono d'accordo solo parzialmente. Le politiche Glocal hanno senso fino ad un certo punto, ma è assurdo pensare in un mondo sempre più globalizzato che le risposte principali possano arrivare da dimensioni locali. Si rischierebbe di rincorrere i fantasmi del regionalismo, anziché quelli del nazionalismo in un mondo che va ad una velocità folle.

&gt; Concordo, in fin dei conti nel parallelo che avevo proposto credo solo fino ad un certo punto, e cioè che l'attuale situazione sia dominata da forze centrifughe, non centripete come furono quelle che portarono poi ad un accentramento di potere.

Veramente dal 2009 si è assistito ad un nuovo accentramento dei poteri per far fronte alla crisi. Il problema non è stato tanto quello, quanto il fatto che si sia accentrato a livello intermedio (quello nazionale) e non a quello più elevato (quello europeo).",True,False,0,1527881393,,False,0,dzyh5dy,False,t3_8npkto,True,t1_dzyfgqn,/r/italy/comments/8npkto/casual_friday_habemus_governum_edition/dzyh5dy/,,1532095064,markdown,2,False,True,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

But that's not really the fault of the game its self, its mostly just there not being any good matchmaking/Elo right now. It would be the same in CS:GO if you were just matched against randoms.

And I agree that its sad that private servers aren't open to everyone yet. There are places you can scrim though if you want to. There's a huge amount of minor tournaments out there that you can use to practice too. And like you mentioned, Hotdrop.gg which was created to solve both of those problems. (That there is no good matchmaking and that there is a lack of opportunity to scrim). It will get much easier for people to experience competitive gameplay in the future.

If you think that the scene was ""manufactured"" or only based on money, you couldn't be further from the truth. The online leagues and most of the current top players already existed before any of the big teams came in and picked up teams. It is very much something grass roots that grew organically. TSM is an oddity in that they are mostly streamers that got picked up.  Almost all of the other teams were picked up because they showed results. They placed high in the online league seasons. Those leagues have always had open qualifiers each season too.

And there have been very few tournaments so far that are invite only. Starladder is the only one I can think of. Almost every big LAN event has open qualifiers. For example, the $100.000 tournament running this weekend had no invites, only qualifiers. PGI is the same. In the two most recent European qualifiers to events like this, over 1000 teams have participated.

&gt; And all the complete bs. about ""tactics"", to make up for inability. You only need one guy to do that, the rest can be mad fraggers - actually able to clear areas. 

The best teams have actually turned out to be those where there isn't one set in game leader but where everyone makes calls. The game is so dependent on reacting correctly to new unique situations and gathering information about opposing team positions and movements is so crucial that you can't really rely on just one person to make calls. You need to let whoever sees an opportunity to call it out right away.

While tactics are important in the game, strategy always trumps it. What differentiates the absolute best teams from the middle tier is neither aim nor their ability to flank and engage opponents correctly. The biggest difference is how they approach rotations, routing, timings and scouting. How they decide to move in each circle and how the position themselves given what they know about enemy positions. FaZe is by far the most consistent team and have been so for a year now. What they excel at is exactly this. That is how you manage to turn decent circles into good ones and bad circles into decent ones.

That said, you obviously need to have good mechanics too. But everyone in the pro scene is a good aimer. It just end up mattering less than the strategic side of the game since the difference between the teams is smaller when it comes to mechanics, so its harder to stand out.

Just shows how low the standards were in the US when he got his first gig. He does quite a good job acting as though he knows what it's like being successful at the top level. When he's commentating a game, his arrogance is the epitome of why Americans are so bad at it when it comes to soccer. He and a handful of others spend a large portion of their time critiquing players while commentating. As an American who grew up watching the EPL, one of the things that's quite noticeable in the commentating is the optimism that they use when they talk and to not point out what someone did wrong every time a mistake happens. Listening to the likes of Martin Tyler, Jon Champion, Andy Gray, and Clive Tilsdey can really bring the passion out from a game and its a shame that we can't have this in US. Part of me thinks that the US commentators are unable to switch between commentating and analyzing a game while the other thinks that they are bitter which is why they are quick to critique. They could also have a superiority complex being on TV and forgot that their none of their careers have done anything at the top level. Sorry.

&gt; *A former school teacher, Mussolini’s spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini ""instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivalled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed"". As for the scope and spending on social welfare programs, Italian fascism ""compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive""*

&gt;*By 1925, the Fascist government had ""embarked upon an elaborate program"" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance. As for public works, the Mussolini's administration ""devoted 400 million lire of public monies"" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922*

&gt; Se te ocurren tres medidas concretas (no 'no negocies con X', medidas económicas concretas - monetaria, de importaciones o exportaciones, lo que fuera) para bajar la inflación y que crezca la economía?

Te lo dejo a Joseph Stiglizt, premio nobel de economia, que probablemente lo va a explicar mejor que yo.

&gt; *Lo que en cambio se ha articulado, principalmente desde el Banco Central, es una visión chata en la que el foco de la política macro se pone casi exclusivamente en bajar la inflación, y que eso generará un conjunto de condiciones que serán disparadoras del crecimiento. Claro que bajar la inflación importa, pero que el Banco Central se circunscriba a eso como objetivo único hace daño. No termina logrando lo que busca, y es lógico, porque la inflación no es sólo un fenómeno monetario en el corto plazo. Es un enfoque esquizofrénico: creen que porque ellos creen que la inflación es un fenómeno puramente monetario, entonces todos tienen que actuar de forma consistente con esa creencia. Pero si la gente no cree que sea así, no te van a formar precios ni aceptar paritarias que reflejen la creencia del Banco Central. Entonces terminás con dos problemas grandes: no se resuelve ni el problema de inclusión social ni el de falta de consistencia macro. Se daña la capacidad de competir de sectores que son clave para la creación de empleo en sectores sensibles de nuestra estructura demográfica, y encima la economía no despega de forma sostenible y se termina necesitando tomar deuda para poder mantenerse a flote.

False,Bartsches,,,[],,,,text,"Guess I'll be that one guy on reddit that disagrees with nuclear energy. However, I promise to argue out of an unexpected corner every now and then to make the case interesting at least.

A few years ago a visited a [VDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDE_e.V.) congress and among the future challenges discussed was the question of the shape of the energy grid in the future. Ever taller cities and especially increasing automation both in private and professional settings spike the power usage density by a lot. Enough in fact to make the transport of this power into a city unfeasable ^1 for the majority of  large metropolitan areas within the next decades if I recall correctly. 

The logical answer to this is, among other things ^2, to produce as much energy locally as possible  - in the form of (to the human eye) transparent solar cells on windows for example. However, up until now our energy system had a centralized point to point layout  From the perspective of the person presenting ^3 the German Energiewende is, first and foremost, a testbed for the decentralization theory required for a number of future systems, including the energy grid, autonomous transport and Internet of Things in general. Even continued internet access hangs on these theories as with the chatter increase from smart devices even already partly decentralized system types are expecting demand above theoretical capacity very soon. In total this causes green energy to become an enabler for a number of further technologies, either being directly required, or by contributing the research in system theory needed to make them viable. As such both the one holding that presentation and the ones holding any other presentation were in favor of switching to green energy as far as it was topic despite having no misgivings against nuclear energy as a technology.

Anyway, to return to the topic and on to  more direct economic aspects, a kWh of nuclear energy is cheaper than a kWh of fossil fuels or renewables outside of fringe cases. This is only absolute if one looks exclusively at the production however. Depending on country waste management may drive the total costs way above the other two tough I lack the knowledge to really expand on this point. Other points, such as the inability to scale with low or high fluctuation demands and large minimum upfront costs are further limiters to nuclears usability.

Geopolitically, the elephant in this forum I'd wager, nuclear no doubt has its advantages as you stated. However it also has stark disadvantages. For one you are creating a point of dependency which, depending on which ir theory you describe to, leaves you exceedingly vulnerable. Say if Crimea had housed the nuclear reactors producing energy for the entirety of Ukraine without extensive backup systems in place that would have been the end of the war right there. Alternatively, if an attack on the scale of stuxnet was to be directed at powerplants (or even just transformer stations) that could make an entire county go dark.  
Further on the security issue, nuclear is a relatively mature technology with a low failure chance if maintained properly. Now, lets say Greece, a country bankrupt and with a known corruption problem had a reactor on your border. Would you trust them to maintain it? While a nuclear reactor is quite safe when operated within specifications do you trust humans to keep within these specifications at all times when a failure has the potential of annihilating a country ^4? Even if it would be perfectly safe, even against plots from hostile states or terrorists your neighbors don't know that for certain, sparking tensions as recurrently seen between Belgium and Netherlands/Germany ^5. 

--------------------------
1 This is due to a) the number of possible approaches being restricted by terrain or existing high value assets  in many cases and b) due to a limit of how much energy thoughput you can realistically achieve per land diameter before either having any additional energy lost in transit or getting into really nasty failure states or other unacceptable influences.

2 Intelligent load distribution utilizing Internet of Things triggers (force automated washing machines to wash at night or other low demand times, possibly steered by load calibrated energy prices for example) and skyscrapers with inbuild short term energy storage and so on.

3 Germany chief of a global player. No names though, purely for my memory wanting to mix names and faces and I don't wish to wrongly attribute statements.

4 It has come to my attention that the potential damage of an actual incident is often misunderstood on reddit, with it being seen somewhat like a car crash that kills those involved and forces you to drive down the next street at most.  
Within western Europe at least, and this differs from countries with alot of suitable nothing to put their reactors into, a large fallout cloud may very well be the end of countries even when not considering immediate disaster relief requirements and health damage. The reason here is that in economical terms it wipes out alot of real estate that would have been in use before. This not only stops whatever parts of your gpd that plot of land was sitting on put also any gpd part of a supply chain going through there. Given the location requirements of a nuclear reactor nuclear contamination also has an increased chance of disabling harbours and navigable waters. And besides external effects like having the still usable parts gobbled up mighty quickly one way or the other by other countries or your credit rating inventing a new rank in such an event, losing large parts of ones gdp instantly would disable your ability to sustain your government internally.

&gt;Toxic masculinity

&gt;The concept of toxic masculinity is used in psychology and gender studies to refer to certain norms of masculine behavior in North America and Europe that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. Other stereotypically masculine traits, such as self-reliance and emotional repression, are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse.

So at its core it is a useful concept.  It's about teaching men that it's ok to ask for help and to show emotion, and it's also useful to teach society that men can be victims too.  

Basically, Toxic Masculinity is a name given to a negative stereotype of men, so education and awareness of the stereotype should in theory help prevent discrimination against men.

I am a diehard lifelong star wars fan who has consumed most of the EU, all the cartoon series and even liked the prequels more than most, because i thought star wars is like what they say about pizza or sex; even if its bad, it's still good. I was shocked and disappointed at TLJ, but even more shocked and disappointed at the fanbase. I used to visit this subreddit every day, and the supposed frothing hatred that headlines said was to be coming from an alt-right woman-hating portion of the fans seemed to me to be coming instead from the parade of white knights defending the brand. I had to stop visiting here because rather than finding an honest discussion about the paper-thin plot and genuinely surprising character choices that were made, i found a daily barrage of people 'defending the wall' like their lives depended on it.

False,HaLoGuY007,,USA,[],2761ea4e-7422-11e7-94f4-0e4502cfd6bc,,dark,text,"&gt; As Italy’s financial elite gathered on Tuesday morning in Palazzo Koch, the 19th century building in central Rome that houses the Bank of Italy, they had every reason to be glued to the words of the governor Ignazio Visco. Italian shares were plunging and bond yields were rising sharply — as a stand-off between Italy’s establishment and upstart political parties enveloped the eurozone’s third-largest economy and raised questions about the very future of the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; In a speech, Mr Visco, the 68-year old Neapolitan economist, offered some reassurance about the solidity of the Italian economy, now in its fourth full year of economic growth and insisted the country’s “destiny” was in Europe. But he also warned that the country ran a “serious risk” of frittering away the “irreplaceable asset of trust” if it made the wrong moves in the weeks ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; “We are on razor’s edge,” says one senior Italian banker.
&gt; 
&gt; By Friday the immediate crisis had been averted, with the afternoon swearing-in of the populist government led by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.
&gt; 
&gt; But the final week of the longest political stalemate in Italian postwar history has also demonstrated the potential for major ructions in the near future, from the prospect of another swift and acute loss of confidence in Italy’s finances to the looming confrontation between the new government and Brussels.
&gt; 
&gt; After separate electoral campaigns that seized on the country’s sluggish recovery, anger at immigration and disgust at the traditional political class, Five Star and the League have joined forces to try to defy the EU and overhaul a wide range of rules they blame for many of the country’s troubles. Their main aim is to challenge the fiscal constraints that govern the single currency in order to implement a package of tax cuts and spending increases.
&gt; 
&gt; While both Five Star and the League insist they are not considering Italy leaving the euro — a U-turn from previous positions — their combative approach towards Brussels threatens a profound rift with the EU and large member states including France and Germany. “This is a new historical era, it will be a very complicated path,” says Sergio Fabbrini, professor of political science at Luiss University in Rome. “What does it mean to be within the eurozone while being permanently critical of the eurozone?”
&gt; 
&gt; By Friday, Italian assets had bounced back as investors judged that having the League-Five Star government in place with a slim majority was a better alternative to another election in the autumn, prolonging the uncertainty and probably further boosting the two populist parties.
&gt; 
&gt; But the mix of aggressive rhetoric, political posturing and outlandish policy proposals that emerged during the past month of intrigue in the Roman palazzos serves as a cautionary tale for the months ahead as Five Star and the League take charge. Since starting serious talks in early May following a two-month long stalemate, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old Five Star leader, and Matteo Salvini, the 45-year-old League chief, considered, then retreated from, plans to create a path for Italy to leave the single currency and ask the European Central Bank to cancel €250bn in Italian debt.
&gt; 
&gt; After a stand-off over who should be prime minister, the pair plucked Giuseppe Conte, a little-known 53-year professor and civil lawyer, out of obscurity to lead their alliance. And when Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, used his powers to veto Paolo Savona, their choice of finance minister, because of his staunchly Eurosceptic views, they lashed out at the head of state, calling for mass protests as if they were victims of a coup. “This is not a free democracy if we are in this shape,” Mr Di Maio said. “It’s useless for us to vote if governments are decided by ratings agencies and financial and banking lobbies. It’s always the same people who decide who governs,” he added.
&gt; 
&gt; From the establishment viewpoint, the dispute over Mr Savona exposed the new government’s naivety. “Mattarella has tried to make them mature, but they haven’t matured,” says the senior Italian banker. “These people don’t know what they are saying — they created a blueprint of impossible dreams.”
&gt; 
&gt; The cleavage between the elite and the political upstarts is nowhere more apparent than in northern Italy. In Milan, Italy’s finance and business capital, bankers and business leaders were angered by the rout in the markets as a result of this week’s political crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; In contrast to the rest of the country, the banking and fashion hub has been living a Gilded Age it has not seen since the 1980s. Milan’s economy grew 6.2 per cent from 2014 to 2017, double the national average, and is now above pre-crisis levels, according to data from regional business group Assolombarda.
&gt; 
&gt; Central Milan’s residents, which include billionaire industrialists, fashion moguls, banking and legal bosses and television stars, voted overwhelmingly in the March election for the governing centre-left Democratic party.
&gt; 
&gt; The prospect that financial instability and battles with Brussels could put at risk this period of prosperity led to a remarkable response from Milan’s political leadership in the form of an open letter signed by every mayor of the city over the past 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; “We affirm with great conviction our belief in European values,” the mayors, who stretch from the left to the conservative League itself, wrote in the letter. “It is absolutely wrong to even put in doubt the participation of our country in the great European community.”
&gt; 
&gt; But outside of Milan, with its glitzy skyscraper bank headquarters, the mood is far different: the Five Star-League coalition is entering government with broad support from the Italian electorate.
&gt; 
&gt; Even in Veneto, a prosperous north-eastern region whose small and mid-sized entrepreneurs are part of Italy’s economic backbone and have close ties to Germany, the resentment towards the establishment is keenly felt — the collapse of two prominent regional banks triggered big losses among retail investors. In this region, the Democratic party was heavily defeated in the March election as both the League and Five Star strengthened their votes.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our hope is that the League and Five Star together will get us our money back,” says Walter Baseggio, a local League supporter wearing the Lion of Saint Mark, the symbol of Venice, at a café in Montebelluna, a town of 32,000 which was home to Veneto Banca, one of the collapsed banks . Lorenzo, who sports a white beard and greying hair tied back in a ponytail, wipes tears from his eyes as he speaks about the country’s traditional establishment, echoing much of the campaign rhetoric that fuelled the rise of populism in Italy.
&gt; 
&gt; “These people are so corrupt they do not care. They are a cabal who all feathered each other’s beds”, he says, naming bankers, the EU, the European Central Bank, the regulators and the outgoing centre-left government.
&gt; 
&gt; “I feel like I am stuck in Dante’s Commedia . . . All I feel in my head is rage, rage, rage,” he says. To them, the election of Five Star and the League represents a mix of justice and revenge for perceived wrongs and a fresh start.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Conte insists the Five Star-League alliance will be able to channel this voter angst, while demonstrating it can provide an effective government. But even on the eve of power and responsibility, Five Star and the League did little to tone down the harsh rhetoric — particularly on social media — that helped fuel their rise.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Salvini, who will be vice-premier and interior minister, posted a video on Thursday of a black man apparently plucking a pigeon on the street. “Go home!!!,” he wrote.
&gt; Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco reassured the financial elite that Italy's 'destiny' is in Europe © EPA
&gt; 
&gt; Italy’s centrist, pro-EU opposition, meanwhile, is trying to regroup in the hope that it can block the more radical proposals coming from the new government and exploit the contradictions and divisions that are bound to emerge between Five Star and the League.
&gt; 
&gt; Carlo Calenda, the outgoing economic development minister who recently joined the Democratic party, has called for the creation of a “Republican front” as an alternative to the populism.
&gt; 
&gt; “Salvini has contributed to fuelling tension, institutional clashes, division and fear,” he tweeted on Friday. “Now the time for chatter is over and he has a lot of work to do, for the first time in his life.”
&gt; 
&gt; In Brussels, the dilemma will be how to manage an unruly, defiant government in Rome at a time when the EU is already facing a testy conclusion to Brexit negotiations, friction with both Moscow and Washington, as well as other uncooperative member states such as Viktor Orban’s Hungary.
&gt; 
&gt; “[Italy] is quickly becoming issue number one as we head into the June European Council,” says Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group.
&gt; 
&gt; While this is exactly what Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini may have been angling for, the country’s economic and financial establishment is on the defensive again, and assessing how much damage has already been inflicted, even if this week was just a scare.
&gt; 
&gt; “Markets are now considering a new phase in which the main question is will we be in the euro or not,” says the senior banker. “If this is true it means there is a probability attached to an exit.”

&gt; Um policial militar reagiu a um assalto e matou um criminoso, no bairro Maracanã, em Cariacica, na Grande Vitória, nesta quinta-feira (31). O outro assaltante conseguiu fugir e ainda não foi localizado. O capitão da reserva, de 48 anos, estava parado no local porque ia dar uma carona a uma pessoa, mas foi abordado por dois assaltantes e reagiu, atirando em um deles, que caiu na calçada. O policial ainda correu atrás do outro criminoso e atirou, pelo menos, mais duas vezes, mas o assaltante conseguiu fugir. Já o baleado morreu no local, mas ainda não foi identificado pela polícia. De acordo com a polícia, o assaltante que conseguiu fugir era o que estava armado. Ele correu até se encontrar com um comparsa que o esperava num carro.

For example, if a burglary occurs, they will only investigate it if there was violence or if a certain amount of valuables was lost. That’s just one of many examples but the short of it is, criminals have a lot more incentive to commit crime.

Not sure why you think London is at a really good place - international crime statistics doesn’t have it at a good crime or safety index, not even in the top half, and it is probably worse now. UAE for comparison is probably top 10 for safety (a long with Japan). 

As for the NHS, if we again then the clock back to early 2000’s, sure it’s great. But now, it’s hardly world class compared to the European alternatives. They have far better systems in place.

For education, I should have clarified - I meant pre university. At university level I agree, London is world class. It was for children that I was referring to - where secondary schools and colleges are mostly rubbish. Teaching as a professor has been hit hard in the past decade so the average quality of teaching or motivated teacher is also on the decline. I wouldn’t trust my children to be getting a decent education to be honest in these classrooms in London. There are good schools, but I’d have to move outside of London.

I am in no bubble, but I understand all good things come to an end albeit temporarily (a recession period, not just economically but socially) - I’m confident UK is going to go through that and that we have yet to see the worst.

However, if you have a serious illness like cancer or heart disease, then these countries with public healthcare are the last place you want to be because not only are you going to be waiting a long time for MRI's, scans, surgeries, etc., but you also have to deal with mediocre doctors \(obviously not all of them\), because the best doctors will go to countries with private healthcare due to the incentive of a higher wage, and there's also no incentive for doctors to try to offer a great service because you can't go anywhere else, due to their being very few competitors \(given that it's so difficult to compete with a 'free' service\).

**I lied. I haven't had sex with girls from Albania, Montenegro, Moldova, Andorra, Lichtenstein, Malta or the Italian Microstates.**

I told a couple of friends that I'd had sex with girls
from every European country. I said it
offhandedly but they told other people and now
like all my friends know. I didn't have a choice so I
just went along with it and now it's a thing. But
the truth is that I still haven't had sex with girls
from all European countries yet. I've been trying
but it's pretty hard to find girls from some of the
smaller European countries unless you actually
go there and I don't have the money right now. I
traveled across Eastern Europe a couple of years
ago and checked most of the difficult ones off but
I wasn't able to them all so I have to wait until the
end of the year until I can get back there.

Tl;dr: I'm a liar.

I wanted to talk about Brexit, without actually talking about Brexit, so I focused on UK/EU relations with Heath and Wilson in the 1970's and then Cameron since about 2009 and up to his decision to call a referendum. I looked at 3 aspects during each time:

Firstly I talked about Heath and his negotiations to join the EEC, then British international diplomacy during the oil crisis, then Wilson and his negotiations to change the British terms of entry.

In the second part I looked at Cameron and his decision to withdraw the Tories from a major coalition in the European Parliament, then his negotiations with the EU over the fiscal compact treaty, and then the negotiations to change British terms of membership which ultimately lead to him to suggest a referendum. 

I tried to link this all together with a discussion of nationalism, diplomacy,and legitimacy. 

To be honest, I tried to have too much in the dissertation, and some of my different sections were a bit brief and crap. I wanted to look at the ways that the UK tried to diplomatically engage with different partners and how this impacted on their efficacy in the international sphere. 

My conclusion \(which, to be fair, was poorly written and a bit shit\) was basically that Uk and Eu diplomacy are each tied to different ideas of nationalism and therefore looking at different things and working in different ways. This difficulty in talking about important thing sis compounded by the public diplomacy that went on under the different governments, especially when Wilson and Cameron allowed their cabinets to disagree with their politics publicly. This issue is what I suggested has lead to all the major problems for Theresa May. High level politicians are now almost expected to disagree with their Prime Minister and will face no backlash. 

This is all complicated further by politicians repeated and powerful appeals to the public to be final arbiters of policy and legislation, which has in effect created the need for a House of the People, which perhaps just has the political power now but needs a space for this to be exercised effectively. 

The actual dissertation was a bit crap because it was a distance learning course, and I'm working full time in China as a teacher. I really needed to do another draft to make it a bit tighter, but I didn't have the time. I actually thought about doing an IAMA on Reddit, but didn't have enough time.

Most people I've seen online (e.g. content producers) who voluntarily identify under the label ""alt-right"" just aren't (neo)-fascists. Fascism is too narrow a political subset of authoritarian nationalism, the American alt-right people typically want a return to the European favoured immigration policies of the US pre-1965 (or no immigration at all) and a return to the demographic (or sometimes even cultural) profile of that time also.

How that latter point is addressed is where debate exists within that community, also as to why that is seen as a good thing. People advocate ""white nationalism"" by politically diverse and frequently incongruent arguments. It's not different to the fact that people argue for racial diversity from different and sometimes incompatible angles. Moreover fascism is even less appropriate as there is not inconsiderable overlap between libertarians and the alt-right because many advocate strongly for freedom of association and minimal government control over private interactions (e.g. remove laws that stop racial discrimination in hiring or service practices so I can create a voluntary racially homogeneous community). See Hoppe.

Alt-right is a super loose label, neo-fascism is too precise and misses the granularity of things. Even ""white nationalist"" isn't quite right because it's more ""ethno-nationalist"" i.e. a broader belief that ethnic groups are best served in homogeneous societies, not just one specific ethnic group.

I follow this stuff out of morbid curiosity, it seems to me that the ""alt-right"" is highly mischaracterised in the mainstream and it ends up serving them because it lends credence to the argument that mainstream outlets and ""moderates"" are untrustworthy.

I suspect that ""white supremacy"" only really exists in two communities. The 4channers and the common brown people.

The former, mostly as a coping mechanism for the fucked up nature of their societies and governments \(they *are* losing their countries and have no actual control over policy as it is in the hands of the venal professional class and politicians\).

They're not significant to anyone really, but they prove useful to The Left, to scare up and stoke resentment in the hearts of venal and entitled browns \(and blacks\) in Europe, to then ride that for their own political/emotional ends.

The other group that actively ""generates"" white supremacy is the middle class Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani, who uses relative fairness as a status symbol and takes his own frustrations out on the darker desis.

Pretty much all the records that we have now have been passed down (copied from one piece of paper to another) throughout the past couple of millennia, so copies existed in the 16th century. And a lot of the classical archaeological sites are above ground and have been since they were built, so they knew those buildings were there and more-or-less what they represented. I don't think there was much in the way of serious academic archaeology going on until around the 18th century, though. They would have known how long ago the classical era was and the dates of many major figures and events, not because of radiometric dating but simply through written chronological records that had been maintained the entire time.

For that matter, the term 'Renaissance', referring to the new economic, intellectual and cultural advances around the 15th and 16th centuries after the end of the medieval era, literally means 'rebirth' and was chosen because the people of that time believed that classical roman times were the greatest era of history and that the new developments represented the birth of a second 'greatest era'. They deliberately patterned their new art, architecture and academic institutions after those of classical Rome with the idea that these represented the most cultured and civilized ways of doing things. (Amusingly, the popularity of bare white stone sculpture, such as [Michelangelo's David,](https://www.michelangelo.org/images/artworks/david.jpg) around this time was meant to be based on similar sculptures left over from the classical greeks and romans, but archaeologists determined later that the classical sculptures had actually been brightly painted when they were new, and the paint had washed off over the centuries.)

People of the 16th century would have known a great deal less about earlier civilizations, such as the ancient egyptians and sumerians, because written records from that far back were a lot more scarce and harder to translate accurately.

Around 2010, Americans and Europeans ate between 10% to 25% more calories than the coastal Chinese, and about 50% to 60% more protein.

So that's about 250 to 800 more calories, with an average of about 500 or 600 more calories, weighing by population.

Chinese food is deceptively high in calories, and deceptively low in proteins. 

But again, this is coastal Chinese. These measurements don't account for the inland Chinese. 

What really matters though, is being born to a wellfed mother. The Chinese still have another generation of rapid height growth.

Most races will have both a Democrat and Republican candidate and may have various 3rd party or ""independent"" candidates. 3rd parties are like the Libertarians, Greens, Constitutional party, etc and are almost always irrelevant but can decide a super close election by stealing votes from the main parties. However many areas of the US are strongly pro-Democratic or pro-Republican so the weaker party may not even try to compete for local seats like state legislature or city council. 

Here in Seattle, Republicans don't even bother running aside from random people who get basically no votes. Almost every race ends up being Dem vs Dem in the general election. The same is true for Republicans in more conservative/rural parts of the state.

American political parties are super diverse and are very different that European parties.

&gt; Morbid Angel is a death metal band assembled in Tampa, Florida, United States in 1983. They, along with bands like Death, Obituary and Deicide, were crucial in the development of the death metal genre and its standards. Since the band's formation, the band's leader has been guitarist Trey Azagthoth. The band released their first four albums with David Vincent on vocals/bass and Pete Sandoval on drums, before Vincent was replaced by Steve Tucker for the three following albums. Vincent briefly returned for their eighth album in 2011, but was again replaced by Tucker in 2015, with Pete Sandoval being later replaced by Scott Fuller on drums after leaving the band in 2013. The band released their ninth full-length album ""Kingdoms Disdained"" on December 1, 2017.

&gt; Morbid Angel made their vinyl debut in 1987 on New Renaissance Records. Morbid Angel was one of the original death metal bands signed to Earache Records, and was also influential in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots to its current form by adding guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, incorporating atonality in guitar soloing, and dark, chunky, mid paced rhythms. It was also the first death metal band to have a touch of mainstream success, such as being signed to Giant Records in 1992 and having the music video for the song ""God of Emptiness"" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butthead.

&gt; The original lyrical themes focused mostly on Satanism, paganism and anti-Christian subject matter, but from the second album, Blessed Are the Sick onward, the lyrics slowly moved toward the ancient Sumerian gods, though much of this is a nod to the Simon Necronomicon, which was influenced by Sumerian mythology as well as the author H. P. Lovecraft, as well as a fascination with the Roman Empire, though ""anti-christian"" elements continue to permeate the lyrics. Their albums are notable for being released in alphabetical order (their first album starts with the letter A, the second with B, etc.). Guitarist Trey Azagthoth has said in an interview that it was at first a coincidence with the first albums.

&gt; In 2008 appearance on some of the mid-summer 2008 European festivals was announced as a ""short break from writing and pre-production of their new"". After 3 years Morbid Angel released their expected 8th album Illud Divinum Insanus in June 2011. The album includes industrial and nu-metal elements. Also former Hate Eternal drummer Tim Yeung recorded the drum tracks for this album. The album was not well received by a big part of the fans, who liked the band's older and more purely Death Metal sounding albums. 
But there were also fans who accepted and embraced Illud Divinum Insanus. Read more on Last.fm.

It's unfortunate when someone motivated to seek recognition in a competition with no regard for sportsmanship meets PS2. Exploiting is merely the tip of the iceberg. Aside from abusing easy mode playstyles there's lots of chances to abuse fellow Planetmen when being unable to accept losing[[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Briggs/comments/5rksra/vortx_is_getting_banned_lol/dd825fk/)], and, chances to abuse feedback [[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/85cmsx/thank_you_udbdrew_for_what_you_have_done_to/)] on reddit to move the game towards easy mode recognition[[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/7jx5up/vs_briggs_player_skechi_sinking_modules_under/dra6yg3/)]. Bad sportsmanship in pursuit of recognition also led to deleting posts on reddit when things went badly [[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/57vbe5/new_tr_mapglitching_exploiters_and_how_they_say/d8wfv5k/)].

I’m the security you just mentioned.

Security on ships is based on the charter and the cruise line.

The contracts I work have three different tiers-

Me, the contract worker.  I’m a safety/enforcement officer who can manhandle the fuck out of you if you get out of line.  I have no detention authority but I can put your ass on the ground however roughly or gently I decide to.  I answer to the charter but not the cruise line.

Actual maritime cops.  I’m not sure about the legalities.  We call them “white shirts,” they are American (like me) and they have arrest powers.  They can detain you and you will face charges upon returning to the states.  I had an intense argument with someone over how that can’t be true working my first contract.  It’s true.  I’ve seen them arrest folks for drug possession usually, but battery is common as well.

Ship security.  When you sign your contract when purchasing tickets for a cruise, there is a clause in it that says the cruise may take “any steps necessary” to enforce policy while underway.  Guess what?  They mean it.  Ship security are not American and will spirit your ass away to ship jail in a fucking heart beat.  How you get treated will largely depend on your conduct toward them and the nationality of the general customer population.  They typically treat Americans and most Europeans with kid gloves.  Others...  

What “ship jail” entails is based on the ship and the cruise line.  IME they will dump your ass at the next port on the route and you have to figure out your own way home.  If you’re not so lucky they turn you over to port authorities and you answer to whatever legal system is in place in that nation.

Don’t do stupid shit on a cruise.  There’s cameras everywhere.  We saw you do it.  We have it on tape.  Especially theft.  It’s a 10x10 room with nowhere to hide shit.  And we saw you do it.

A privilege, it's worth noting, that has allowed me to earn a very comfortable living with no college education as I watch the rest of my generation drown in student loan debt while making barely above minimum wage in their chosen field.

I know the hate that people who look, talk, and dress like me hold for anyone who is different. I work with them, and exclusively them. A constant stream of bile flows from their ignorant mouths, day after day. I know these attitudes pose real danger; just the thought of the damage they could do to my life and livelihood is enough to keep my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth.

It is all I can do just to muster the strength to say, ""Sorry, but I just disagree."" And I know my career has suffered even for that.

As far as what I understand of GDPR, as long as you're doing ads through Admob, you must have their consent. 

So if you wish to use Rewarded Video Ads, you'll require their consent no matter what. 

What this calls for is a more custom dialog from you, since you can't offer the more common approach of ""Ads"" or ""Ad\-free"". 

So you must write up a new Consent Form that deals with your particular issue. 

How dependent on Rewarded Video Ads is your app? If it's an integral part of your app and they can't use the app without it, then you can explain this in your Consent Form. Tell the EU user that to use this app, they would have to grant consent because of how fundamental this is to the app. Make sure to include the privacy policies from the Ad Providers and your own app so they know clearly what's happening with the data they consent for. So this becomes a ""Grant or Uninstall"" form, which you can't avoid due to how your app depends on Rewarded Video Ads. 

But if your app doesn't depend on these ads that much and it's simply you wishing for it to exist... then I'm afraid you'll have to make a sacrifice of losing out on a user or losing out on some ad revenue. Consent must be granted before you can show them, so if they don't grant consent, you simply can't show rewarded video ads.

The EU is behaving in a very hostile way, and Britain should take a leaf out of Canada's book and walk out.

False,Metlman13,,,[],,,,text,"Going up against the Maginot Line would effectively end hopes of Blitzkrieg winning the war in Western Europe (high German casualties would lead to all offensive movements against the line being halted), and would put Germany and Britain/France into a position similar to 1914 where the armies were entrenched in well-fortified positions, unable to meaningfully gain ground and thus entering a long stalemate situation where the most either side does is hurl bombs and artillery shells into the other's trenches, occasionally sending sappers to dig tunnels to the enemy lines and plant mines under their trenches to destroy them and create a temporary weak spot in their defenses.

German Blitzkrieg depended on breaking through weak positions in enemy lines, quickly moving with motorized armor to encircle enemy divisions, and then, having cut off the enemy, work to destroy it with superior firepower. Even with the Luftwaffe, the Germans did not have superior firepower against the heavy guns of the Maginot Line encased in thick layers of concrete specifically to protect it from German artillery fire, and breaking through the weaker sections of the line would have meant a grisly affair with many thousands of German dead and still much more of the line to deal with, being difficult to conquer even when flanked.

The Maginot Line was a very impressive fortification in its day, the Germans knew attacking it was tantamount to suicide and the British/French knew the Germans were much more likely to attack through Belgium.

&gt; DUBLIN - Britain must submit written proposals on how it plans to keep a frictionless border on the island of Ireland after Brexit in the next two weeks or face an uncertain summer of talks, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was quoted as saying on Saturday.

&gt; The border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland will be Britain&amp;#039;s only land frontier with the EU after it leaves the bloc.

&gt; Under the EU proposal, if all other attempts to avoid a hard border fail, Northern Ireland would form a &amp;quot;Common regulatory area&amp;quot; with the bloc, in effect keeping the British province in a customs union with the EU. Britain has rejected this as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK and on Friday a government official said it was considering a proposal giving Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it can trade freely with both.
