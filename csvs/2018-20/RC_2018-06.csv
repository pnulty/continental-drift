Heath care needs to be fixed because we are spending 3x the average per person as EU countries for worse quality care and a major accident will bankrupt someone especially when pre-existing conditions make insurance companies deny you coverage. Everyone covered or cheaper and better care is definitely needed even if it isn't a single payer system.

I see things like public education budget cuts and extremely high tuition and textbooks as a major setback compared to other other countries who encourage cheaper higher education and have better public education. The better you teach kids, the better (hopefully) they end up running the country down the line, the more informed they are about the world around them, and the ability to have more skill or tech oriented jobs.

For something like abortion, even if you don't like that it is an option, at least try to prevent the need to have an abortion by having a better and more open sex ed with easy access to birth control (reduced teen pregnancies). Possibly better welfare or public service system to help single or young parents take care of their child without it being the thing that completely ruins their lives. After that have a better foster care or adoption system may decrease the need too. Even if you aren't making it illegal, doesn't a large amount of prevention help everyone? I mean abortion can be one of the last choices on the list but more options and prevention always helps.

Environment, I don't want to end up with cities that look like Beijing due to no regulations on air pollution, rivers that catch on fire like in Ohio, or oceans/lakes that you cannot fish or swim in because you will get sick, dying coral reefs, overfishing causing starvation and extinctions.

""While the initial opposition of Margaret Thatcher and of François Mitterrand to reunification has been widely documented, the full depth of both leaders’ anxieties is revealed in papers to be published by the Foreign Office on Friday. On November 28 1989, just two weeks after the Berlin Wall came down, the then West German chancellor Helmut Kohl announced a 10\-point plan for reunification without consulting either his European allies or the ruling Bonn coalition.  That blueprint triggered several private meetings between Mrs, now Lady, Thatcher and Mr Mitterrand to discuss the German question. Memos detailing those discussions, written by Charles, now Lord, Powell, the then foreign affairs adviser to Mrs Thatcher, are among the most striking of the documents to be released.  One meeting between the two leaders was at the European Community heads of government summit in Strasbourg on December 8. Mr Powell relates that Mr Mitterrand spoke critically of Mr Kohl, saying that he had no understanding of other nations’ sensitivities and was exploiting German “national” feeling.""

Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has never forgotten the hostility he faced at a European meeting on December 8, 1989. Ten days earlier he had unveiled a 10\-point\-plan for German reunification and been met with the blatant skepticism of Europe's leaders. In his memoirs, the former chancellor has described how British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously told the heads of state when they were gathered for dinner: ""We beat the Germans twice, and now they're back.""

&gt; Tera Melos is a band from Sacramento, California  , that incorporates many styles of math rock, math pop, jazz, ambient electronics and unconventional song structure all in one, to create their original genre. They are currently a three-piece (formerly four) consisting of Nick Reinhart (guitar/vocals/keyboard) Nathan Latona (bass), John Clardy (percussion).

&gt; Tera Melos play a brand of math rock music characterized by quickly alternating rhythmic patterns, start-stop dynamics, improvisation, two-handed tapping on the guitar, extended open-ended bridges, and the use of effect pedals and samplers. After releasing a four song demo in 2004, they self released their untitled debut full-length on October 4, 2005. The album comprises eight tracks, and was re-issued in 2008 on Sargent House. While some of the tracks on the album feature distorted vocals that are somewhat undecipherable, (guitarist) Nick Reinhart started contributing more prominent vocals to the music with the release of their 2007 split with By the End of Tonight, called Complex Full of Phantoms.

&gt; Right before they started recording their second EP Drugs to the Dear Youth, one of the guitarists, Jeff Worms, left the band. It is rumored that Worms left to become a football star. This has been confirmed by Worms, although he has not cited what college he is currently playing for. On January 19, 2007, Tera Melos released the LP on Sargent House. ‘Drugs’ for short, was a step away from the previous sound they had before and farther into more progressive and original regions.

&gt; Tera Melos have over the past few years, developed a cult-like fan base around the United States and have recently gained some popularity in Europe, Asia, and South America.

&gt; Tera Melos announced on their MySpace page on April 2, 2007, that drummer Vince would be leaving the band to pursue other things, namely returning to college to pursue a career as a math professor. The band began searching for a new drummer shortly thereafter. After a little more than a year, the band announced the addition of John Clardy as their new drummer. Originally the band had planned a long-awaited LP release after touring, however they ended up releasing an EP of covers, featuring songs by The Beach Boys and Polaris, entitled Idioms, Vol. I.

&gt; On November 7, 2009, Tera Melos confirmed a new album due out in 2010 in a myspace bulletin. The post stated that the band was set to begin recording the next day, November 8. The new album, titled Patagonian Rats, was released in September 2010, and like their 2007 split with By the End of Tonight, it included vocals. Read more on Last.fm.

The USA has been the world 'beat cop' for too long. The EU countries pay less than 2% GDP for their militaries. Most of 'Allies' of the USA expect the USA to pay for their protection. These 'Allies' maintain minimal militaries that are at best jobs programs. The USA can no longer afford this insanity with Russia and China creating large and well-funded militaries. In addition, I don't want my children to fight to protect the EU from Russia or Asia from China.

For decades the USA has been 'free' trading with other countries which allowed a lot of manufacturing to be moved to other countries by the industrialists in the name of profits. Maximizing profits for a small minority where much of the money is shielded from USA taxes is not as useful to the country as a large pool of people paying taxes. So add a tariff on all imports to cover the lost taxes of the people who are not employed as a result of these imports.

I'd like to see an additional head-tax on all non-citizens (Except green card holders) with employment within the USA. This would take care of all the H1B visa problems, Illegal alien problems, etc. that people whine about.

Rather than making tariff cuts that are directed solely at the United States, their cuts are mostly directed at other nations.

Again, from that initial New York Times piece you shared,

&gt;China is energetically trying to rally *other* governments to its side in its showdown with the United States. Beijing’s latest move could assuage concerns from many European countries and developing nations about their own trade deficits with China as well as loss of manufacturing jobs. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/business/china-trade-tariffs-trump.html

And, from the Bloomberg article,

&gt;While the levy reduction could be claimed in some quarters as a concession to Trump and will be a boon to U.S. carmakers such as Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co., the move will also end up benefiting European and Asian manufacturers from Daimler AG to Toyota Motor Corp.

Also,

&gt;A duty cut would typically benefit luxury carmakers or manufacturers, like Tesla, that don’t have a local production site. Most automakers produce mass-market models in China.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-22/china-is-said-to-cut-car-import-duty-in-boost-for-lexus-bmw

Lastly, from your other linked New York Times reporting,

&gt;China has carried out a pledge to cut tariffs on imported cars and car parts, the latest move by Beijing to ease trade tensions with the United States. The American auto industry and its workers, however, might be *unimpressed*.

It then goes on to highlight that,

&gt;By cutting the tariff on imported car parts more than on imported cars, China may actually strengthen its role as the world’s largest car-assembling nation.

&gt;Lower tariffs on imported components will make it more attractive for global manufacturers to do much of their final assembly in China, since they will not have to pay as much to import high-tech parts made elsewhere.

And not one damn person took any consideration, regardless how sincere and softly I spoke, nor how comedically over the top, I spoke but no one listened, or cared. 
So, I think that the ""most vocal"" people, saying truthful things or really screwed up and ignorant things, are either semi-famous, famous, or people will needlessly draw attention to them: ""OMG, can you believe this person? *shows video*"" But that's just my opinion, nothing more.

As far as the stormtrooper debacle; yeah, I remember a lot of sad trolls who wanted to poke people's sensibilities with sticks, a few ignorant saps, and a fair number of people who were SW but not EU fans who weren't aware that Clone Troopers were eventually phased out of the Imperial forces, due to instability, decrepit age due to the sped-up aging process, or rarely held it together and remained strong; and that the Empire then took volunteers/enacted conscription depending on the situation and timeline, and were unaware of that, and became angry only because they were uninformed and thought that The Force Awakens was blatantly disregarding the fact all Clones (and mistakenly therefore all Stormtroopers) looked exactly the same as Jango Fett, by having a black stormtrooper. That doesn't excuse it, but it does explain it to a degree.

(Edit: believe me, when i heard about that, I was incredibly con-kiffing-fused as to why people acted as if it was impossible until I saw why they thought so.)

As far as groups who hate female leads in SW; are you sure they're not complaining over the poor quality of the ones we've received in Disney's films in a short-handed/simplistic manner? (Cause if they're saying in all seriousness ""fucking women are RUINING/have RUINED Star Wars!"" then yeah, to hell with 'em in my book.) Or maybe, another unfortunate possibility: the films' quality is being laid at the lead actress' feets? (i.e. it's Rey's fault that The Force Awakens sucks!)

Either way, I'm sorry to hear that for you/the groups you're amidst.

Nao conheço nenhum sub dedicado apenas à comunidade trans e acho que seria maravilhoso que existisse um.

A idéia desse sub aqui é ser um guarda-chuva mesmo, em que todas as pessoas que experimentam de forma não-heteronormativa a sua sexualidade, afetividade,  identidade de gênero, etc, possam encontrar um lugar seguro para se abrir, conversar, apresentar suas dúvidas e buscar informações.

Mas eu entendo também que cada comunidade pode se beneficiar de ter subs mais específicos sobre as suas experiências em particular. Por exemplo, hoje meu sub favorito é o /r/bisexual porque lá encontro uma ressonância grande com a minha próprias experiências.

Enfim, tudo isso pra dizer que eu não conhece nenhum sub, e que se alguém quiser criar, tem o apoio automático desse sub aqui.

E também que se o seu namorado ou você quiserem conversar sobre qualquer assunto aqui, sintam-se totalmente a vontade. Algumas pessoas trans já se manifestaram aqui e acho que tem sim gente suficiente para começar pelo menos um engajamento sobre questões específicas. E daí quem sabe até criar um sub! :)

First off, it's important to note what he is *actually* claiming: 

&gt; First, researchers confirmed the widely known fact that, overall, Americans are much more religious than Western Europeans. [...]

&gt; Second, the researchers found that American “nones”—those who identify as atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular—are more religious than European nones. The notion that religiously unaffiliated people can be religious at all may seem contradictory, but if you disaffiliate from organized religion it does not necessarily mean you’ve sworn off belief in God, say, or prayer.

But note that the study did not refer to ""nones"". It asked about *religious affiliation.* 

So he is NOT saying what the headline said. He is NOT referring to atheists. He is saying that some people who claim ""no religious affiliation"" continue to have religious views, and this is more common among people in the US then among people in Europe.

*Well big fucking deal!* Anyone with a brain should be able to understand that ""no religious affiliation"" is not the same as ""no religion"". This ain't rocket science.

As for the headline, it is disproved by the study itself:

&gt; Indeed, many religiously unaffiliated adults eschew spirituality and religion entirely. **Majorities agree with the statements, “There are no spiritual forces in the universe, only the laws of nature” and “Science makes religion unnecessary in my life.”** These positions are held by smaller shares of church-attending Christians and non-practicing Christians, though in most countries roughly a quarter or more of non-practicing Christians say science makes religion unnecessary to them. (For a detailed statistical analysis combining multiple questions into scales of religious commitment and spirituality, see Chapters 3 and 5.)

All in all, that article is a joke. 

Edit: I will note that if you separate the article from its sensationalist headline, it is not really controversial.

Even Jewish websites will confirm that in the early 20th century Jews represented between 10% to 30% of the entire population and most of them were immigrants from Europe. The true natives of the land who have real roots and connection to the land going back several generations are Palestinians. 

Finally Jordan was virtually empty during the time of the British mandate, while Palestinian cities were vibrant urban centres full of activity and history. So it is the opposite of your revisionist propaganda. It is the Jordanians, about 40% to 60% of them who are displaced Palestinians, not the other way round because historically it was the West Bank of the river Jordan that was populated and built up and not the east bank.

There isn't an impartial way to view Trump because he has no ethics, no standards, and no point of view (other than Trump is the best). Because of this, all newscasts and information will be inherently biased (far more than usual). Media either roots for him without a critical thought (Fox News), or lambasts him without a second guess (CNN, MSNBC).

During the campaign, he did say he wanted to do a few things: kill Obamacare (not done), kill Iran deal (done), exit Paris Accords (done), tax reform (not done), build border wall and get Mexico to pay for it (not done), re-negotiate NAFTA (not done).

He did put forward some long-standing conservative wishes in his budget, but these are largely restricted to tax cuts for richer Americans and lack any comprehensive character that a true tax reform bill would have had.

The simple fact is, the American President is a stupid, spoiled rotten, manchild. Sometimes, when throwing a temper tantrum, the baby does something good (e.g. pursuing peace talks with North Korea). Most of the time, he just insults everyone (e.g. literally anything on his Twitter).

People voted for Brexit because they were tired of mass immigration. End of. They did not vote for Brexit because they wanted to damage the economy or because they were racist or xenophobic. It is not racist to not like seeing the UK radically transformed from a nearly homogeneous British (which meant white, English/Scottish/Welsh/Irish) country into a ""diverse"" nation through importing millions and millions of people from very different cultures and faiths who have brought a lot of troubles and complications with them that the British public really didn't need nor want. 

The British public was remarkably tolerant, but polling for years after years showed strong support for limited immigration (that had existed before 1997) and discomfort at the scale of mass migration. The one time they could actually have a direct vote on *something* that involved immigration (leaving the EU solely to end FOM) they voted to leave. 

Why is this a surprise? It's because the educated experts and academics and journalists cannot bring themselves to accept the simple reality that a lot of people don't particularly care to see too much immigration changing their country too quickly as well as bringing too many people they really didn't want in the UK (aka Muslims). They struggle with this because in their world it's morally right to be diverse. And it's worsened by that they are all products of a small neoliberal (left and right neoliberals, it's all the same these days) class that has thrived in the last 30 years because they reap all the advantages of the neoliberal economy and the benefits of things like freedom of movement while at the same time they don't have to put up with the disadvantages of the neoliberal world they've enforced on the masses and repeatedly told people to shut up and put up with it because it's the *morally* correct world for the future. They do nothing when millions of people feel increasingly left behind economically, and then they tell the same people to shut up when they now have to compete with millions more immigrants for the same resources and jobs. 

Brexit is not complicated. It's very simple. But unfortunately most of these ""explainers"" are as dense and stupid as the aristocrats of France in the days leading up to the Revolution.

Because this way, countries can discriminate against very specific product imports \(and imports from very specific countries/companies\), and encourage the import of others. The complex nomenclature is also useful for statistical purposes.

Developed countries usually allow duty\-free imports of raw materials \(Ore, oil etc.\) and half\-finished products, with some tariffs remaining in industries that the signatory nations want to protect, usually finished products and high\-end technology \(future economic value\) and agriculture \(jobs!\). 

The EU trade policy towards nations with which we dont have trade agreements specifically descriminates against specific types of manufactured goods and agricultural goods. The EU charges significant rates on agricultural goods, but we use a weird system that says the *cheaper* your foodstuffs are, the *higher* our tariff rates are. This is done to ensure a minimum price level for European farmers.

We also charge \(comparatively\) high tariff rates on things like cars \(10&amp;#37;\), clothes and shoes \(8\-20&amp;#37;, depending on goods type\), cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, to name a few on top of my head. We like any kind of product our manufacturing/services sectors need \(industrial machines, robotics, computer screens, printers etc\), so these are usually free. This is usually a good rule of thumb.

In the case of the EU, since we do not have a free trade agreement with the US, the EU and the US charge each other *Most Favoured Nation* rates, so no tariff discounts for us. American products receive the same tariff rates, as, say, Chinese products.

When trade agreements are signed, however, signatory states usually remove tariffs entirely on at least 95&amp;#37; of products, and reduce tariffs on others. The contents of trade agreements are the result of years of negotiations. Trade agreements are used to *divert* trade, so for example, the EU has trade agreements with countries like South Korea, Vietnam and \(soon\) Japan, which will contribute to diverting manufacturing away from China. Of course, the EU will receive concessions from these countries as well, like lower tariffs on EU products, better protection of EU investments and better protection of intellectual property.

What people tend to forget is that rules of origin \([https://www.wto.org/english/tratop\_e/roi\_e/roi\_info\_e.htm](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/roi_e/roi_info_e.htm)\) are also a very important part of trade agreements, which basically boils down to: *how much of the product was produced in country X?*  In modern supply chains, it almost never happens that, say, a car produced in Mexico is produced in Mexico only. Many parts are imported from other countries. Who is to prevent companies from importing a car from China, screwing on one bolt, and claiming it is Mexican? You need to prove that at least X&amp;#37; of the value of the car was actually produced there.

This is one of the things Trump wants to renegotiate: He wants products imported from Mexico and Canada to have to contain higher percentages of ""homemade"" value, which indirectly benefits the US, as parts imported from the US is counted as made in Mexico/Canada for customs purposes. Basically, Trump would like to use the NAFTA renegotiation to boost US manufacturing.

Trump is in some sense using bullying tactics: The justification he uses to increases tariff rates on steel and aluminum \(he is also considering cars\) is considered flimsy by most, at least in international trade law, but very useful as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. Mexico and Canada are in general very happy with the NAFTA rules surrounding trade in goods. Trump must therefore introduce incentives for Mexico and Canada to give him concessions on his most important priorities.

There's usually 3 stages for each battle where Light Tanks make a difference;

Early game - This stage is about getting as much info for your team as quickly as possible - highly dependent on map/position in team.

General tactic is to quickly go to a location where you know you'll be able to spot large numbers of enemies. This can be by Passive Scouting (Fapping in a bush without firing) or Active Scouting (Using mobility, terrain and camo to spot whilst smashing the WASD keys and driving like you stole it)

With both tactics the best thing to do is try not to take damage and conserve your HP for later in the game when you're most useful. This means there is no shame in falling back if you don't have enough support or you think you might be overwhelmed.

If you have a SAFE chance to take out/damage/scare off enemy lights/low tier meds then do it. Make a deal of tagging these tanks with T so your friendlies know they're your biggest threat (and hopefully take them out early!) 

Mid game - This stage is massively dependent on the map, where you are in the team list and which light you're playing. 

During the mid game you work best as mobile support and a sneaky spotter/damage dealer. Try not to take too many risks and again, if you have to fall back then FALL BACK!

It's quite hard to explain how this stage works because essentially you're a reactionary force. 
Use the minimap and look for areas you can make an impact. 

Is the East flank pushing and needs eyes? Go work to help spot those bush fapper TDs.
Is the West flank being overrun? Go lend some fire support to slow down the enemy advance then use your mobility to run if the flank falls.
Did an enemy LT find a gap and is now going full speed towards your arty? Go hunt them down!
Is there 12 enemies on 1 flank and a clear run to the rear lines on the other? Time to make bush fappers regret not moving! 

Make as much use of your assets - mobility, view range and camo. Don't brawl unless you have to. Look for distracted enemies and go for flanking shots where possible (no 2 key spam unless you really have to) 

Remember in the mid stage you're still a support tank and your heavies should be at the FRONT using their HP and armour so you don't have to brawl. 

Late Game - Aka the fun stage! 

This stage is when LTs shine - Assuming your team hasn't folded or stalled for 10 minutes you can now exploit everything that makes Lights great.

You can isolate and take out enemies 1 by 1, route out the last bush fappers and generally wreak havoc behind enemy lines. Flank, spank and run away!

If during the early and mid game you kept your HP (Or at least most of it) don't be afraid to take a hit or 2 - especially if locating a bush fapper TD who doesn't have WASD.

Late game is usually the time to take out arty (As hopefully by now the useless ""protectors"" have moved away or left them to die)

Light Tanks can make a massive impact on your chances of winning on nearly every map, and offer the most rewarding gameplay when done right. The downside is when done wrong you will die and die fast. 

Remember to use your assets and don't be afraid of falling back if you have to. Also don't let friendly meds push you about and ignore TDs sat in useless bushes screaming for spots. Remind them there's no point in you dying for them to get one shot off ;) 

There's a lot more to cover but hopefully that gives you some idea. 

Enjoy!

It's difficult to point to any one specific factor in why Christianity overtook traditional (at the time) polytheistic religions in Europe. My estimate is that a few psychological factors all contributed to its rise in a very interesting way.

(1) as other posters have pointed out, Christianity was a 'proselytizing religion'. This is an interesting factor of itself but it's important to unpack the psychology of why this was so impactful. 

Prostelytiation itself is the act of CONVINCING people with DIFFERENT beliefs that YOUR belief is correct. If your religion demands that you proselytize,  it means that you have to become skilled at convincing people to adopt your views, which is a skill all to itself. Early christians were very good at 'selling' Jesus to people who hadn't been exposed to any form of aggressive religious sales. Early Europe was a ripe ground for religious salesmen because they'd never been exposed to the concept before.

(2) Christianity was one of the first ""fundamentalist"" religions in the region. This is an especially interesting concept to dig into, but early religions in Europe and elsewhere were much less into ""truth"" (i.e. Our gods are literally true) and more into experiental psuedotruth (i.e. We had a bad harvest and usually when we pray to Poseidon rain comes so we just do it, it's a tradition thing). Christianity claimed to have fundamental truth and was aggressive in the way it presented this idea. To Christianity, the idea of jehovah god sending jeshua Jesus to die for our sins, was a no holds barred absolute fact, as opposed to the shakey ""we believe because of our tradition but don't know why"" religions of Europe. To boil this down, Christianity made absolute truth claims, which is a surprisingly convincing rhetorical device. 

(3) Christianity was new. We can observe firsthand how ""newness"" can be an arguement all to itself in getting people to buy in to something. New app, new phone, new technology, new whatever people will buy it simply because its the latest and greatest thing. This concept can also be applied to religious sales. Many in Europe bought in to Christianity simply because it was the newest convincing ""product"".

(4) on to a few of the concepts you brought out in your question details. Previous religions in Europe had mostly been oriented towards a vaguely 'glory / honor' type tradition. You lived an honorable life, did what your 'duty' was, and you'd get a shot at spending time with Zeus in the afterlife. However this left out quite a few people. Society of the Christian Era had evolved into a agrarian / city one, and many people didn't fit into the traditional roles that religion had set out. What happens if you lived life as a rogue or bandit but wanted to change your life and live one acceptable to society? Christianity answered that, whereas older religions didn't. What if you were a slave and wanted to one day be free and integrate into society? Christianity once again had an answer whereas older religions didn't. The takeaway is that Christianity had more answers to the problems of that era than the older religions, and hence people flocked to it.


The tldr is that Christianity had a massive competitive advantage against older western religions due to its newness and aggressive approach towards conversion.

I'm starting to have hope, that this shit won't go on forever, that we CAN be saved, that this utter SJW-Insanity that spreads here as well is NOT the finite answer to everything and that I'm not the only one who sees how insane it is.

The thing with Germany is, that Germany is extremely afraid of acting like Nazis again. So they try VERY hard not to. By being VERY obedient to the state and extra-""liberal"" in the refugee crisis. But they do it with an extremisms that made them Nazis in the first place.

Let me explain:

Assume that the Germans have ingredients for how they act. These ingredients are: Obedience, Conformism, Coquetry, Sense of Superiority, Need to fit in with your Peers, Need to be a part of the whole They cooked a soup in 1930 with these ingredients, because that is how Germans WERE and STILL ARE. So they cooked a Soup, using these ingredients and got a Nazi-Soup. It tastet sweet at first but had a very, very bad aftertaste.

Fast-Forward to 2018. The Germans are VERY AFRAID of EVER cooking a Nazi-Soup again, but they do NOT understand that they're using the VERY SAME INGREDIENTS again, just in a different situation. They're using these Ingredients, because THIS IS HOW GERMANS A-R-E. I'm a German and I'm telling you this. The Germans of 2018 are NOT ""healed"" from what made them Nazis. (Edit: What I have to add here is that this does not mean, that the Germans are genetically EVIL. Imagine if you have a GOOD Ruler that can ""use"" the German potential. But with the Germans you can make them into Tools of war very easily"")

We see that, because they're cooking a soup, using THE SAME INGREDIENTS: Obedience ""The State knows what is good"", Sense of Superiority ""Look, we take in ALL the Refugees, we're the GOODEST of people"", Conformism ""The Neighbour does that, I can't POSSIBLY to things otherwise.

In fact, what they cook is another Nazi-Soup, it tastes the same, just has another name. And when they trink it this time, the outcome will not be as devastating as the last time, because that depends on the situation. It's not the same situation, it's absolutely different. It STILL can destabilize Europe all over again and lead to worse things.

I find the idea that some text in an ancient language that wasn't even prolific enough to be copied (the text, not the language) would have been pivotal to human development a little far fetched.

That being said, I think it’s a combination of many factors with gun violence over there, a long standing culture and glorification (think generic Wild West cowboys) of weapon usage, lax controls and non standard laws laying an even baseline universally, lack of exposure to correct and acceptable usage of weapons and the safeties etc., sadly I think that it is so ingrained and such a longstanding issue it would take several civil wars to change. 

Great example is one of the Northern European countries, not sure exactly which but I think it was Sweden, where civilians have a mandatory military period, are trained and exposed to firearms and upon discharge are given their weapon to store at home and having next to no gun violence. Yes there’s strict controls on ammunition but much easier to pocket a few rounds here and there than to procure a firearm. 

Also, there are many many stories of armed civilians stepping in and either preventing crime or assisting law enforcement but they aren’t glorified in the media like all the school shootings and other acts of random violence. I’m sure you’ve seen some on like Facebook or something (there was one I saw with a crim beating a lone police officer with a weapon while holding them down when a civilian shot the crim and saved the officers life, no charges laid either) but nowhere near as often as the negative or on as large a scale as general media.

If you get siege from rewards and don't want it, you can send it to a commander or sell it on TP. Generally commanders will have an idea of howmuch supply they want to use where, and for what. Dropping your own in addition is usually not helping. If you're not following a commander, you can drop siege where you please but be mindful that not every wall can be killed, and many many spots can easily be countered.

If you repeatedly die very early in the fights; it's time to start listening to voice comms and get a proper build. There's no fun in constantly trying to make your way back to the zerg. You get more bags and more entertainment by playing well and winning fights \- so put in the effort that requires. 

**Join the squad.** I understand this isn't true for all groups everywhere; some guilds like to run closed squads but still don't mind pugs to follow; especially on NA. However, especially on EU a lot of servers run ""open"" raids with pugmanders. \(Often blue tag on EU\). Players in squad will usually get considerably more buffs, and can get devided into subgroups to fix boons &amp; healing properly. It also gives commanders information about the health and whereabouts of their players in a more trackable way. In my experience players in squad will almost always res others in squad first. Not every server accepts every class in squad; squads can only hold 50 players and some classes do have boon priority over others when playing ""meta"".  

It may seem like you have no influence over the outcome of zerg fights due to numbers, but you do. And from my point of view, you can do this with virtually any meta class \(fb, splb, scourge, rev, chrono, weaver\) altho some are easier than others. And some are much better when played vocal \(chrono for example\). 

A good bubble will enable everyone in range to spike, and gives a clear place on where to localize damage when placed right. Good commanders or even just pugs that see a good bubble go up will capitalize on it. 

A good firebrand will allow 4 people to do signifcantly more in hard fights, and overbuff many others. I'd say a good firebrand buffs the DPS of each player by upwards of 50&amp;#37; especially in harder fights, and allows each player you support to do their role far more consistently. Or perhaps the enemy revs are farming your flank players; but in the end all it takes is a few good range or sometimes gank players to pressure them enough that your flank can live. And when you give them freecast; even very new players can pressure a lot of enemies. Or perhaps you're chrono who turns questionable melee pushes into great melee pushes by simply calling a pull and spiking players rather than attempting to train them down with your zerg. The difference \(in momentum\) between quickly spiking 3 players down with localized CC and damage versus trying to chase players with a blob is the difference between farming spread gank style players and slowly getting clowned. 

In weaker groups it's not even rare to see single players do upwards of 30&amp;#37; of damage, very high number of corrupted boons, condies cleansed and so forth. 

Likewise, not pressing your buttons \(well\) can escalate quickly too. If you get engaged on and you don't use stab on time as firebrand, then party members are going to burn cooldowns or die. Even if you're the one engaging, not popping stab at an appropriate time while you engage will lead to half your party already trailing behind due to a single line or static; and make them unable to provide any pressure on the first spike. 

I've seen blobs with more than 5 spellbreakers wipe before dropping more than 2 bubbles. And most range or DPS players in the game don't know that they can drop damage behind themselves with look behind and / or free camera; and prefer to just let their melee die alone while they're disengaging. 

**It's a very, very team heavy gamemode.** Your allies rely on you to do your job, and you rely on them to do theirs.

For starters, almost all of Europe has a relatively low fertility rate, which can be explained by the second demographic transition (as of 2016, no single country in the EU is at the replacement rate, or even above 2.0) In the post soviet sphere, the low fertility rate is better explained by the economic shocks of the nineties, and the resulting societal problems like alcoholism. 

In no way is there any kind of causal link between legalized homosexual relationships and low fertility. The second demographic transition has occurred due to contraception, the increased presence of women in the workforce, women in higher education, alternative forms of cohabitation, migration, and a general increase in individualism and autonomy. 

Just for fun, to take your bad logic one step further, we might say that homosexuality leads to higher fertility rates in Europe, as Sweden(which is actually a very interesting case if you want to examine how family policy and legislation can have an effect on the fertility rate) and France have the highest fertility rates in Europe. Denmark, Norway, and the UK also have relatively high fertility rates. On the other hand, Bulgaria, Poland, Serbia, and Albania have low fertility rates. (Source: Eurostat) Your conclusion, therefore, should be that increased rights for the LGBTQ community lead to higher fertility rates. 

If you actually want to increase the fertility rate, it’s much more important to decrease the opportunity cost of having a child, not resist the normalization of LGBTQ rights.

[The incident involves Southern sitting in a small boat, floating in front of a large boat, chanting slogans:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KziepDf53C0)

1. The NGO boat was \*leaving\* Sicily to go to Libya; there were no asylum\-seekers onboard
2. The NGO boat was a medium sized vessel, not the kind of rubber dinghy that risks people 'drowning' as you indicate
3. Any seafaring vessel operators have been protected by legislation by the EU from punishment for transporting 'refugees'. Generation Identitaire \(the group Southern was with\) and other [independent organizations](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-04/something-strange-taking-place-mediterranean) assert that this arrangement has allowed criminal organizations to embark on human trafficking enterprises, apart from the already confirmed general illegal immigration.  
Black market smuggling is confirmed as a reality regarding the Europe migrant crisis by the UN; the routes the NGO vessels take suggest that there is extra\-legal activity going on.

4. According to a UN report, [less than 5&amp;#37;](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fjustpaste.it%2Frifugiati&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url) of the people traveling to Italy in 2016 under this paradigm were found to be refugees.

5. Generation Identitaire have explicitly stated that they will not hinder rescue operations or put people in danger

6. Generation Identitaire were in a comparatively tiny boat, waving a flag, right in front of the Italian Coast Guard. This is was political activism, nothing more.

Secondarily, I see the fact that she was banned from entering the UK being brandished as some sort of proof of guilt.

1. She was banned from the UK for [taking part in a social experiment, distributing pamphlets on a street saying that 'Allah was for gays'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxjH5hZYTbQ)
2. An angry crowd of Muslims soon formed.
3. The police shut the stand Southern was at down for *their* safety, as well as 'keeping the peace'.
4. For this, she was later banned from entry to the UK under their *Terrorism Act*, for *racism*.

Let that sink in. She spoke proposing that Islam is inclusive of LGBT, got charged with racism, and banned under the Terrorism Act.There are of course ample video proof that prove this is the truth.

You shouldn't let your society go to shit because of people calling you a bad word. The process of importing foreigners with a foreign language and foreign religion into Europe has so far been a failure. It basically resulted in having an foreign outpost being funded by the natives. We have seen the third generation of Muslim immigrants being less integrated than the second, presumable due to their numbers and the fact that they are creating parallel societies. There is absolutely nothing that indicates that thing will improve.

You're not going to see your precious western values emerge from these migrant communities and they have reached numbers where we no longer have the cultural impact to influence them. They watch foreign TV, they speak foreign language at home, their complete surrounding is 'foreign'. There is nothing anymore to integrate into. Talking about 'integration' is a farce, you can't, It's been already out of our control for a decade and longer. You're going to need western people for these 'western values'.

So call her a racist, a pedophile, a suppressive person, a satanist , a counter-revolutionary, a kaffir, a reactionary, a jordan-peterson fan ... Every islamic migrant she blockes contributes more to preserving western civilization than any confused rant about sticking to 'muh values'.

-----------

&gt;I've read most of the comments in this thread and it is true, no Turk managed to provide a source for these claimed massacres. If it did truly happen, there would be all kinds of records and articles about it.

Not necessarily. Problem is that most European sources both contemporary and today regards Greek independence in a romantic light. It is seen as a righteous rebellion that broke from an occupier. Yet such idea is wrong in that Ottomans controlled much of Balkans before even Anatolia. And how can a state can be considered an occupier in a region it was founded and controlled for hundreds of years? By same logic US would be an occupier as well, no? 

Millions of Turks, Turkified locals, and Muslim locals lived in Balkans. Consider the amount of destroyed Mosques. A mosque is proof of a Muslim community living there as they are constructed due to a need. Millions of muhacirs(refugees) came into Ottoman empire as it lost those lands. Most mosques in the region have been destroyed. Sufi(esp. Bektashi) tekkes which just like mosques served a community are either destroyed, or only its remains are there. Not one or two, hundreds or maybe thousands. Yet how much european sources we have regarding these people moving to Ottoman empire? Even for that, I have barely seen any mentions. How can millions of people can be ethnically cleansed but we have so little sources regarding its reasons? I can't remember any condemnations regarding it unlike Ottoman actions towards Armenians, Greeks, etc.. Did they move for no reason at all? So, yes, we can certainly have very little sources for a big event. 

**The document shared in this thread is contemporary to the events and confirms massacres. It is the proof you are asking for.** Unless you have proof regarding its falsehood, I fail to understand why you disregard it. Do you consider it fake? Why? Can you prove it? 

&gt;Also, you're trying to portray Turkey as a big victim in the Balkan Wars when this isn't true. Turkey wasn't some small, poorly defended country at all. It was the aggressor when it comes to the Balkans for centuries and all the shit the Ottomans have done has turned against them at some point.

So? How does that affect Balkan Muslims? So a country going to war justifies people being ethnically cleansed or massacred? **Why do you even mention this at all?**

Actually Junker, the person asking the question was asking about opportunity, especially for those that are young and living in Southern Italy. Fighting corruption (which is present in many countries across the EU) does not resolve the problems experienced by citizens that happen to be innocent victims. 

Italy was one of the founders of the EU. It is as much of an EU problem as it is an Italian problem. It's a matter that can be resolved or at least helped by external influence from the parent bloc. 

The recent Italian elections have shown people are losing faith. A trend that seems to be growing across Europe and your usual stance of 'ignoring' and 'pointing the finger' whilst refusing to admit it's also an EU problem only adds fuel to the fire.

Illegal immigrants entering the EU from Northern Africa is a European problem. Italy who happen to be geographically located closet to the entry location were left to deal with the problem whilst the EU took months to formulate a draft solution (long tern plan still up for debate) whilst insisting the Italians deal with the immigrants and act accordingly. 

Junker is out of touch and the sooner he steps down the better it will be for Europe. A former prime minister of Luxembourg, a country that has contributed the tinniest amount to the European project in comparison to other member states. Who the fuck is he to state ""Italy should do more work"".

Title: **[US][EU] How do I find a lawyer for Terms and Conditions?**

Original Post: 

&gt; EU laws recently changed. Lots of companies updated their privacy policy. I'm creating a website at the moment, and this reminded me of the very important page that needs to created. This is going to get expensive, so I need to make sure I'm doing things right :/
&gt; 
&gt; How many lawyers do I need? One for U.S and one for EU laws? Where exactly do I go to find them? I'm not too sure about simply googling for a lawyer, as I don't know what I'm looking for, and/or if they are a scam.

A citizen of Serbia, objectively speaking, is very accurately represented by the ""Serbia"" flair. There is no objective counter-argument to that. If it were possible to have both the flag of Serbia and the Albanian flag, I am pretty sure that the user in question would have gone for that, as it is exactly what he/she does in r/Albania.

Yes, but I'd say an Albania flair is an even more accurate. 

&gt;A citizen of Serbia being critical of Milošević and the Serbian role in the Yugoslav wars of the '90s? Say it ain't so! It's not ""arguing against Serbia"", by the way, notice the considerable difference.

If, according to you, only Albanians/Hungarians/Croats/minorities are allowed to oppose that, while Serbs are expected to ""defend Serbian honor and joint stance at any cost"", it says a lot about your mentality, really, which is similar to herd mentality. In real life, I have met a handful of ethnic Serbs from Serbia, living here in Germany, that share the same anti-Milošević view as the person above.

No, it wouldn't. I cannot say this loud enough: You are a free citizen and you are allowed to be opposed to the politics and policies of the country you're a citizen of. Thankfully, the era of forced censorship and dictators is gone, and there is absolutely zero need to go back to 19th century rhetoric either.

These are good points. But not what I meant. I too hate Vucic, Dodik and all the other fuckfaces we have to put up with. And I'm pretty sure he does too. That's fine. 

But the matter of Kosovo is one that goes beyond the crooks. It's a national matter between us and the Albanians. Having one sides flair while supporting the other makes no sense.

Again, same as if I with a Bosnia flair was arguing here that Bosnia should be split into pieces.

&gt;Well, he/she is Albanian by ethnicity. That his/her hometown isn't part of the country of Albania isn't his/her choice and cannot be remedied today. That's just how borders were drawn in 1913, for the better or for the worse. Preševo is in Serbia and Serbia is a multi-ethnic country; there is no actual conflict between being ethnically Albanian and having the ""Serbia"" flair. I sure hope you're not implying that Serbia should treat its minorities as second-class citizens and that they're supposed to ""know their place"" online.

There is no conflict indeed, on its own. But when you argue against Serbia for Albania in the Kosovo issue, there is. It makes no sense to use our flair and not their's if so.

&gt;I beg to differ. In real life, my ethnicity has zero effects on my rights - it's not even marked on my passport - and nationalism doesn't pay my bills. Personally, I have a stronger tie to the country I live in right now than to the country I come from. How strongly one feels about their ethnicity is a personal matter, but it also does not strip away their citizen rights.

Well, we simply disagree here. I feel a lot stronger tie to Serbia than Bosnia. Obviously this is quite different from your case no doubt considering the war here.

&gt;Actually, I honestly find this way of thinking quite irrational and outdated. That is how you and some others (mostly Eastern Europeans) choose to interpret them, and it's often ruining this subreddit's comment sections with all the circle-jerking and even brigading.

The intended meaning and the official association of the flags in r/Europe is with countries/regions, not ethnicities, the end. Let's all just get along now, please? Thanks.

Again we disagree. The way I see it while these are multi-ethnic countries and the countries of everyone living in the them they're also countries of every person of its nationality. Serbia is the country of every Serb, Albania every Albanian etc. 

And I fail to see why it's outdated or irrational. These are nation states whose roots mainly lie in the rise of nationalism.

The sentiment that people shouldn't go to more than one show of a band so that other people can get tickets. Some people follow a whole tour, going to every concert, some people Korean or Japanese fans fly all the way to the US our Europe to see their favourite band overseas and vice versa never has it ever occurred to me that someone would interpret this as fans taking away tickets from others. 

There are bands and I am sure BTS is one of them that have dedicated fans following them around the world. And there is nothing wrong with that at all. 

All the time it was people being happy for others being able to see more shows, those people would write concert reports that were then discussed by those who couldn't go, it was a great community feel. 

I am sorry to say this but what you are writing seems a little like virtue signalling  to me ""Look how selflessly I acted why can't you act as selfless as I did"". To most people the thought of ""taking away ticket of other Armys"" probably never even occurred. 

First there is no guarantee that the ticket you don't buy actually goes to a fellow Army and second, like I said, who are we to judge if someone ""deserves"" to go to one concert or not or if someone ""deserves"" to get a ticket. 
Every show is different you are never watching the same show that is the whole appeal of going to different shows.

And so I'm not being completely useless via a boastful and condescending post, OP, since you're working with a limited time frame to get this done (churning usually requires a few months min lead time to be optimal) you should look into getting the Barclaycard Aviator Red.

Also, please check on American Airlines and search to make sure they have a route to your destination from your home airport, and search via flights paid with miles.

Markovia is also interesting.  In my understanding, I always thought it was in Eastern Europe, but this map shows it bordering France, and from it’s location and shape, I believe it to be made up of the Saarland and part of the Rhineland of Germany.

The majority of what he predicted never came to pass. The only things that did were anti-Americanism in Europe and conflict with Ukraine/Georgia. Make enough wild speculations, and some will come to pass. Literally everything else he predicted went into completely opposite direction, from Kuril islands to Japan (fortified and regularly visited instead) and ""dismantling"" China (Russia ceded a lot of land in border negotiations, as well as agreed to lease even more land for 99 years in Siberia) to ""special status"" of Poland or Baltic states.

I'd agree that if you take only his predictions on Britain or Georgia, it rings eerily true. But taken in context of all the other stuff he wrote, it's just the safest bets he'd made. Just look up all of the other ""predictions"" conveniently listed in that article. 

As for sources on his books somehow being used as a guideline, there won't be any. Because it doesn't happen - both ""sources"" mentioned for these claims in the wiki article you linked say nothing about it. Nor do they provide any justification, let alone proof of that happening.

What may have been taken for ""being used as a textbook"" was Dugin himself becoming a professor in the Moscow State University. He was constantly boycotted by the students for the insane and blatantly propagandist stuff he preached (literally) there. He also got kicked from his teaching position for expressing very radical anti-Ukraine sentiments. In 2014. In Russia. That alone tells how much of a nutjob the guy is.

Hamas is loved among Palestinians you may look at this [election result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election,_2006). Hamas calls to wipe Israel off the map, and doesn't want to recognize Israel in any way or as part of any deal.

Israel PM term is 4 years, and the Ehud Olmert talks were going for 2 years! Ehud Barak's talks ended before the end of his PM term, it's not our fault the Palestinian leaders are tyrants since 2006, and therefore have any time in the world to make agreements because they don't hear their people.

The main reason why Israelis tend to reject any peace plan now\-days is the lack of trust in the Palestinians, when Israel went out of Gaza, Gaza was almost completely sovereign the army wasn't there and no blockade was up \(only few restrictions were practiced\), that situation lasted for three years, till Hamas managed to hold control in Gaza and shook himself from any previous agreements that the PA made with Israel and threatened to carry out terror attacks.

The WB is an hour drive from Tel\-Aviv where most of Israelis live, like I said in other comment, if the PA will be sovereign most probably [Hamas will gain control over the WB](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8nfwzl/countries_that_recognize_kosovo_vs_countries_that/dzvrv2t), rockets will probably be a daily routine for most of the population in Israel, in contrast to the present were only the people around Gaza strip ""enjoy"" the rockets.

I live in one of the biggest cities in Israel and it's only twenty minutes drive from the WB, do you know how much time you have to seek shelter in those situations? less than 45 seconds.

Review below:

&gt;Do not buy this game. If you did, refund it immediately. The game is godawful in every aspect and is just one huge cash grab. There are many, many issues with the game, but I will try to list only some of the core ones.
Cannot teleport to dungeons without spending real money
Whereas in other popular MMOs you get teleported to dungeons for free, on Bless Online you are forced to either walk there or spend cash shop currency each time.

&gt;See: https://i.imgur.com/QF5QkoU.png

&gt;You would think that they would have at least included it as a $15 monthly sub benefit, but even that would have been bad. The developers are finding ways to milk players dry of their money in any way possible, even though the game just came out and is B2P (with an optional $15 sub AND cash shop). There is also no cross-server queueing for dungeons like you would expect from an MMO in 2018.
Infinitely loading splash screen bug and no communication from developers
The game needs to be restarted repeatedly until it finally loads, usually taking around ~20 client restarts each time. I myself have already restarted the game around 60 times today just to play a few times. This infinite loading screen issue has been present for well over 40 hours now, and the developers are not even acknowledging the issue or talking about a potential hotfix, even though thousands of players have been complaining about it all day long. It just feels extremely unprofessional on their end, both from an apparent lack of (any) testing and a lack of communication.
Inaccurate and absurd Toontown-like chat and name filtering
There is forced chat filtering (which cannot be disabled) that censors words such as ""how"" or ""who"" since the word ""ho"" is detected in them, which makes me feel like I am playing a broken version of Toontown from 2008. Players are restricted from using player names such as ""Muffin"" as well. For a game that has been in development since 2009 with a $60 million NA port budget, this is just outright embarrassing.

&gt;The reasoning for any form of filtering does not make sense either, since the game was marketed towards adults, and there is mild nudity in the game. You can also set your boob sliders very high and make your character very erotic looking.
Poor English Translation
The English translation is obscure and riddled with errors. Due to the poor translation, some quest tasks are too confusing to complete, and it is hard to understand what your character's abilities actually do. Even the most basic of things, such as the level up message that pops up each time you level up, has badly formatted text and is bunched together.

&gt;See: https://i.imgur.com/XHn0gH4.png
Lack of UI settings, screen resolution bug, and terrible default settings
It is not possible to change your screen resolution through the ingame settings without causing the game to freeze and blackscreen, which forces you to restart your PC. As of right now, the only way to safely change your ingame screen resolution is to directly edit the config files.

&gt;It is also not possible to customize the UI interface at all. You cannot resize core UI parts such as the chat or the mini-map. And there is a massive lack of game settings in general. Want to turn off the 60 FPS cap, increase your game FOV, or disable the inconsistent mouse smoothing? You have to manually modify the config files.
Terrible Optimization
I get 30 FPS and stutter in more than half of the areas in the game (even worse in populated areas such as the city), despite having a GTX 1080, i7 7700k and an optimized config. I can only imagine what sort of unplayable performance I would get in a 100vs100 battleground.

&gt;Streamers opinon about the game (both streaming with 100k viewers at the time):https://clips.twitch.tv/BlatantFineFriesBCWarrior
Item Dupe Bug
There is an item dupe bug that is still present from the previous, outdated versions of the game. There are already thousands of duped items, again without any acknowledgement from the developers about a potential rollback or anything. The fact that the developers even released the game, without fixing this known issue beforehand, is just beyond me.

&gt;See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8dXV3AUwQQ
Buggy tab-targeting and lack of fluid action combat
When you tab target, it sometimes randomly targets the enemy behind you. An action-cam mode would fix this, but there is no action-cam mode for any of the classes except the Berserker, and even on the Berserker it does not feel natural.

&gt;Additionally, a lot of the attack animations lock you down in place so it does not feel fluid at all, and to make it even worse, some of the chain animations have a delay that makes it feel as if you are playing with 500ms.
Problems with potential future server merge / losing player names
Instead of adding shared servers and more channels, the developers decided to add 6 more servers on both NA and EU, which will become a huge problem in the future when the game's hype dies down. The servers will likely merge in an effort to boost player interaction, and some players will be forced to pick new player names (and maybe even lose their guild) due to them already being taken.
Excluding classes and content from the game on purpose
The game is missing the Assassin and Mystic and pretty much all of the endgame content that is present in other versions of the game, which the developers probably took out intentionally just so that they could gradually add the ""new"" content through the course of a couple of years without doing any real dev work.

&gt;And oddly enough, even though the Assassin class is not in the game, enemies still drop Assassin gear which is useless.
No Endgame - developers deceived players about there being one
The current version of the game, compared to the versions on RU and KR, is missing a lot of endgame features.

&gt;Some missing features are:

&gt;•	No Daily Dungeons

&gt;•	No Arenas or Battlegrounds

&gt;•	No PvP Ranking System

&gt;•	No PvP Reward System

&gt;•	Basel Canyon (main PvP map) is empty without mobs

&gt;•	No Royal or Honor Quests

&gt;•	Only two ""end game"" dungeons with exactly same gear score drops

&gt;•	SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, so you cannot progress past level 45.

&gt;•	Skill Gem acquisition is broken

&gt;•	No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)

&gt;The developers were quite deceiving about the lack of features as well -- selling founder packs and advertising a headstart as if there was an end to run to, plus falsely advertising about there being some end-game boss dungeons which are not present in the current version of the game.
Pay2Win, Overpriced Cash Shop, cash shop currency is CHARACTER bound
Cash shop currency is restricted to the specific character that you bought it on, rather than your entire account like in other MMOs, which is quite obnoxious.

&gt;And even though the game just came out and the developers claim a pure B2P, non-P2W marketing model, there are still a lot of convenience items in the cash shop, such as potions, experience and gold boosters, repair kits, resurrection scrolls, teleport scrolls, and even 20% dungeon point boosters. All of these items do give you a competitive advantage over other players even if only through faster progression, which I personally would consider P2W nonetheless.

&gt;On top of spending $30 for the game and an optional $15 sub, you still have to spend $20 on stuff like costumes, pet customes, pets, and mounts, or $15 to change your character's appearance. 

&gt;Want more inventory slots? Spend $10 for 8 inventory slots.

&gt;Want to reset your skill tree and try out a new build? Spend $5 in the cash shop for a reset scroll.

But here are the FACTS and they are well documented and sourced:

What was Germany's status before Merkels announcement/statement?

In the whole of 2014, there were 626,960 asylum appliactions in the EU countries, 202,645 in Germany. This marked an increase of almost 60% compared to 2013, or an increase of 160% to 2012. Source: Eurostat

In the first eight months of 2015 (so before Merkel made a statement), Germany had 263,085 asylum applications (which is already more than we had in the whole of 2014). Source: Eurostat

Dublin rules were officially still in place, but generally not enforced in regards to Greece. Reason: Both German courts and the ECJ prohibited it to deport to Greece based on Greece not being able to offer a humane treatment to its refugees. ECJ Case C-4/11. As a result, it was impossible to enforce Dublin.

Third week of august '15: In a meeting between the ministry for migration and refugees, the ministy of interior affairs and the federal states, the question about the refugees from Hungary arises. All parties agree that we would put Hungary in a bad situation if we strictly applied Dublin and sent back all refugees into a country that was already struggling severely. Reminder: In the first eight months of 2015, Hungary continuously had significantly more asylum applications than any other european state, including sweden and Germany. In august, Hungary had more total asylum applications than Germany depite having an eighth of the population. Source for the numbers: Eurostat

Aug. 25th: The German Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) tweets this. It translates to: ""We are at present largely no longer enforcing #Dublin procedures for Syrian citizens."". This was actually not meant to be published, it was essentially just an assessment of the factual situation. Neither Merkel nor her office knew about this happening.

Sept. 3rd: The Federal Government publishes a statement that Dublin III still applies, despite what the previous tweet of the BAMF said. Link to the statement

Sept. 3rd: Hungary is stopping all trains en route to Germany. Refugees trying to make the journey by foot.

Sept. 5th: Orbán claims that the situation is no longer under control in a telephone conference with Merkel and Faymann. Germany and Austria agree on letting the trains leave Hungary, transit through Austria to Germany to relieve pressure. It is meant to be a one-time action. Merkels office announces that we will not reject the people coming here from Hungary.

Sept. 13: Germany reintroduces border controls.

What did Merkel actually say?

Probably the most repeated sentence of the whole crisis is Merkels 'We can do it'. It will be up to the historians of the future to evaluate whether this was actually true for the reality. The statement originates from Merkels annual summer press conference which was about a multitute of issues. I unfortunately could not find a full english transcript and it is way too long to translate it for this post, but I will translate the relevant passages.

Merkel: Most of us fortunately do not know the state of complete exhaustion, combined with fear for ones life or for the life of ones family. People that are coming here from Eritrea, Syria or Northern Iraq have to endure situations and fear that would let us collapse straight up. Therefore, when it comes to dealing with these people, we have to ensure that some core principles find application. These principles origniate from no lesser source than the Grundgesetz, our constitution.

First: The fundamental right of asylum applies to people that flee political persecution. We can be proud about the humanity of our constitution. This humanity especially finds expression in this article [the right of asylum]. We grant protection for all of thise that flee wars. They deserve protection as well.

The second principle is the human dignity of the individual. This is a core principle that article 1 of our constitution mandates us to follow [note: this article can not be changed]. No matter whether someone is a natural citizen or not, no matter why and from what country someone comes to us, no matter what prospects his application for asylum has - we will respect the human dignitiy of every human inside our borders and we will use the full force of the constitutional state against those that mob other people, that attack other people, that commit acts of arson against their accomodations or want to exercise violence. [...] There will be no tolerance towards those who question the human dignity of other humans. [...]

I will also say: Nevertheless, we still live in a good country. The state of the nation is good! The civil society, often mentioned, is reality here and I am proud and thankful to see how countless people in this country are reacting towards the arrival of refugees. The number of those that care for refugees in the current day, the number of people who give a helping hand dwarfs the number of the xenophobes and rabble-rousers. [...]

In the near future, we will implement new legislation that increases the speed of processing the applications. We need more capacity to house refugees. We need to be determine quickly who has a good chance to stay here and who doesn't. We have to make decisions quickly so that we can deport those who have been rejected quickly. [...]

I will just say: Germany is a strong country. The mentality that we have to apply to this issue has to be: We managed to do so much in the past - we will do this! We will do this, and whereever we meet obstacles in our way, we have to work to overcome them. The federal government will do all that is in its power to do this.

There then is the european dimension, and I think we are allowed to say: Europe as a whole has to move. The states have to share the responsibilities for refugees coming here. The universal civil rights have been closely connected to europe and its history. This was one of the main founding principles for the EU. Should europe fail to adress this crisis, this connection will break loose. [...]

There is little value in publically shifting the blame, but we have to say: the current situation is not satisfactory. The ministers of interor affairs will meet on sept. 14th. The heads of states are ready at all time. The topics are countries of safe origin, hotspots in italy and greece, a fair distribution. The topic will be quotas inside europe, that will not only take population into account but also economic strength. A little bit of fairness.

There is a third point that we have to consider: [Bring peace to Syria and surrounding countries, help these countries] [...]

Merkels statement ends here and is followed by a Q&amp;A

M: ""There is a high level of agreement that we need to relieve pressure from Italy. It is not possible to say that all refugees who arrive there have to stay in Italy just because they came via the mediterranian sea. The dublin agreement is not working like it used to because the circumstances have changed. As a result, it is important that every one of has to engage for europe and mutuality, then we will move forwards.""

[...]

M: I think it is fine that the V4 are holding meetings on the issue. There are meetings between Germany and France or Italy, I have no objections.

[...]

M: Concerning the question of Dublin III: Dublin III is the regulation that is in force, thus I greatly appreciate Hungary registering the refugees - something that not all countries are doing, one has to say; Hungary is doing this very well. I think it created a certain amount of confusion when we had an inner debate in Germany where several federal states stated that syrians have to be decided very quickly as pretty much all of them are genine refugees fleeing a war zone. The head of the Office for migration and refugees subsequently stated: Yes, syrians will be identified, afterwards they will have a very quick procedure to be accepted as a civil war refugee. This has resulted in the creation of the following impression: If a syrian comes to germany and can identify himself as syrian, he is welcome in Germany. This is in fact the reality, in the same way that someone from Kosovo most likely won't be allowed to stay. This has created the wrong assumption that all syrians should come to germany. This however is not the state of the law and we have already told this to the hungarian government which has to deal with the phenomen of syrians inside its borders saying ""let us go to Germany"". It is not the case that we could simply diverge from Dublin III, we don't have any other treaty on the issue. But if one country is building fences, a second country is allowing everyone to transit and a third country isn't registering everybody anymore, one has to say: If this state is the reality, we have to attempt to find a better one, a state where Law and Acting are in accordance again. But the legal basis for us and for the hungarian government is the one that is in force today [dublin III].

One of the main issues is that all that Merkel said on the issue has been reduced to a few sentences which fail to carry everything she said. Merkel is often quoted with very strong statements on this regard where her actual statements have been a lot more nuanced.

For example the salaries of  apple employees who work in shops selling finished apple products in France for example are much higher than those of Chinese assembly line workers and engineers overseeing production lines. Technically the store clerks/teams in the US or France are generating more value per hour because the finished batch of 100 iphones is being sold on their end for $800 a pop by a team of 20 people per week, while the Chinese team of 20 workers might have assembled 100 of them in a week for $50 a pop. 

This measure of productivity is very arbitrary and market dependent. It speaks little as to role and importance of said role in getting a finished good from random raw materials to a functional doodad. Apple even outsources its design teams now.

'Productivity' has nothing to do with 'hard working' in a globalized economy. However in the developed world Americans do work like pack mules, I know one that does 3 jobs in tandem and basically takes less than 5 days off per year. This is unthinkable in Europe.

False,IFreakinLovePi,,,[],,,,text,"I kept jumping around and adding points to various sections i wrote, so it might have wierd pacing, but here goes:

Well, first and foremost is the obvious thing: try to learn some basic German, or have a pocket dictionary or translation app. It seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how many soldiers come over there and don't bother. Yes, most Germans will probably speak better english than your German will ever be, but the effort is appreciated. Usually when a local will hear your broken German, they'll just switch to English for you. But if you walk up to someone speaking English, they'll often just pretend to not understand. Its basic, but it's still a surprisingly common issue. 

Germans might seem ""cold"" and distant to foreigners. Lots of people have resting bitch face. The new Yorker stereotype should come to mind. If your from the south or a rural area, it might seem rude, but it's not; everyone tends to mind their own business in town. It's also because Germans (and most Europeans in my experience) tend to reserve genuine kindness for people they actually care about and small talk is pretty rare. I've heard from lots of Americans that people feel really ""fake"" in their niceness once they get back to the states as a result. So don't be put off by the directness and supposed rudeness, it's just a façade. 

Kaiserslautern is in a valley, so it gets dark pretty early. There's a decent night life, but nothing crazy. It's a medium sized city. If you want a big city feel then go to Mannheim, it's only an hour away (two by train) and theres tonnes to do there. There's a cool castle ruin in Hoheneken (a ""village"" on the edge of town) and an medieval watchtower at the top of the mountain near Betzenberg (Humbergturm is it's name). 

German has these things called Wildparks. They're something like a zoo crossed with a nature preserve. There's no cost of entry because they're usually just plopped in the middle of the woods, so sometimes you'll just be hiking and you'll find walk into one. The enclosures can be pretty big, so there's a good chance you might not even see the animals from the side you're on. Speaking of animals, there are wild boars in the woods. They're pretty harmless, but if you see babies then just turn around and find another route (mother's get hyper aggressive and have been known to spend hours trying to uproot a tree that an unsuspecting person has climbed). If you stick to the trails and logging roads you'll probably never come across one. 

Learn how to use public transportation. Traffic and parking can be hell and Germans drive with a lot more aggressive confidence than most Americans; this may seem daunting, but Germans have a much more strenuous driver education program so you will likely be the one slowing things down. The train and bus systems are integrated, so if you have questions go to the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) and they information desk is generally very helpful, plus I've never seen one that didn't speak English. An open secret is the weekend pass train ticket. It basically lets you ride as many trains as you want anywhere in Germany for the weekend (restricted to the slower trains, though). Last I was there, it about 20 euro (the euro is fluctuates between $1.10-1.50). On another driving note, if the car you have in the U.S. isn't in top mechanical shape, there's a very good chance it won't pass TÜV, the German vehicle inspection agency, and might not be road legal. Lots of soldiers just grab lemon lot cars because they've usually already passed. If your car gives off lots of emissions (usually older cars), then it may not legally be able to get into certain city centres (you get a colour coded emissions sticker and there's usually signage to tell you). Avoid bringing a truck or SUV, the roads get pretty narrow in some places and you'll stick out like a sore thumb almost anywhere (something something opsec). If you're dead set in bringing your car, the TÜV guys used to be bribable when I was there with a carton (the big one with 20 packs) of Malboros or $50 on the passanger seat, I don't know if it's still the case. Oh, and you need to learnneuropean signage. Unlike the states, little is written in signs because the symbols are international and standardised across the EU and more. The bright side to this that it makes international travel a breeze. 

Speaking of sticking out, you will. Americans can be spotted from a mile away. I can't put my finger on why, but they do. The way you dress is a big part of it, if you don't want to be pegged everywhere you go, then don't buy your clothes at the BX/PX, get them off base. American English, as a language, has a lot unique sounds, specifically the ""A"" and ""R"" sounds, like in ""apple"" and ""car"" respectively, which sounds ""duck-like"" to Germans. This combined with the fact that the stresses in A. English pronunciations often fall on vowels, means that it's a bit jarring and sounds louder than it is. There's a very bad stereotype about Americans being loud and obnoxious, which, while not always true, will earn you a little bit of wrongful, and oft subtle, discrimination in some places. Try speaking softer than you normally would in public. Restaurants, trains, buses, and public areas are generally quieter than in the states. The first time I went out to eat in the US, it felt like a sporting event because it was so loud. 

Speaking of sports, soccer is huge in Germany. They often get close to winning the world cup every year. Kaiserslautern has it's own professional team. The stadium is in Betzenberg. Don't live there. In fact, avoid going out if you know there's a big game. If they lose, it's fine, but German have borderline riots when they win. It might have calmed down in recent years, but it's best to just stay out of trouble. You won't get hurt or anything, but you don't want to wind up having your picture in the news because you accidentally got caught up with the wrong group; I doubt your commander would appreciate it. 

You might be tempted to go to Paris while in Europe, because there's a TGV (bullet train) they goes there from Kaiserslautern. Don't. Paris sucks. As does much of France on the border. Best place in France is in the south, plus you can hop over to Italy and Switzerland from there. Be careful going to Amsterdam, CID watches out for American plates that cross that border, so be prepared for a piss test if you do. Czeck is probably the cheapest place for a vacation while there and you'll get the best bang for your buck. 

I suggest living off base of you really want to get immersed and have fun. It's easy to stay on because it's closer to work, but it's a lot harder to convince yourself to go out and experience everything around you. There are some people that say Germany sucked, but those people often never left post, which is incredibly boring. 

You might find that germans seem a lot nicer when you get further away from bases. This is because young soldiers can be idiots and being in a foreign country doesn't change that. And oftentimes this is the first impression that many Germans get from Americans. Further away, they're knowledge of Americans is limited to what we saw on sitcoms that he been dubbed. 

Try to get out every weekend if you can, there's a lot to experience. 

Let me know if you want any clarification or if you have any other questions. I don't know your hobbies or what you enjoy, so I tried to be as general as possible.

There have been dozens of RCT's showing no real difference between a low GI and high GI diet.

&gt;As I mentioned I'm not interested in RCTs of obese people. I am more concern about Asian populations and what works for my country. At this point we are reducing sugar intake.

Then why are we even talking? Most of the literature I read is U.S. or European. We even have sugar RCTs showing people on a very high sugar diet which doesn't harm them in any way. Not to mention sugar isn't even high GI.

&gt;As for RCT, our local scientists has done a fantastic one on healthy male Chinese population, further proving a low GI diet is better.

That literally doesn't prove anything. People ate less glucose so they had lower Glucose AUC and lower variability? That doesn't matter.

&gt;Eh why not? The hallmark of PCOS is insulin resistance. There wasn't any point for me to reduce weight since I was already thin. My insulin resistance was reversed when I went on a low carb low GI diet. You think I didn't try the other way with high carb 1400 calorie diet when rice is a staple in my country? Didn't work, I wished it did because life would be easier.

Because it is a confound. What might be good for someone with PCOS isn't necessarily good for someone without PCOS. PCOS is also usually a result of hormone imbalances, not diet, but diet can help with it.

&gt;I take blood tests every 6 month to monitor and so far HOMA-IR lists me as insulin sensitive. Ensuring that I have a constant low insulin was the only way that my symptoms disappeared.

Anecdotes don't mean anything especially when nothing is controlled.

&gt;Long grain white rice is also better than short grain when it comes to how it spikes blood sugar - a rise in sugar levels causes the pancreas to produce more insulin, and frequent spikes can lead to diabetes.

I have worked in the leather industry most of my life, as a cobbler and as a consultant for some shoe brands but that was back in Europe. 
I worked closely with shoe factories back in Portugal, Spain, Italy, also worked with tanneries and I just never heard people using these terms as a grading system, even when we were communicating in English. Just saying that sounds so weird to me, it's a complete misunderstanding of what the words actually mean. 
I really have the feeling that this is an American thing only, don't you think? It might also be happening in the UK, but I don't really remember that being the case when I lived there for a little while. (Well, it was a long time ago). 

There is just one thing I would like to mention, when you said:
&gt; 1)Look for a small ""craftsman"" or if you pick a ""bigger brand"" pick one with a solid long-standing rep when it comes to leather/quality. Avoid ""huge"" multi-national brands that make everything from suits to jeans to shoes...because they're not actually making any of those items; all the work is contracted out and who's making what may vary (as will the quality) from year to year (like all ""fast fashion"" they'll pick the cheapest quote at the moment). This is the reason why all the Tommy, Kenneth Cole, Fossil, etc wallets look the same. Avoid websites that look like somebody had a cool idea for a brand name and a logo and farmed out the actual work...a slightly less flashy website is likely to yield somebody spends more time on craftsmanship than marketing.

You are right, however I just want to point out something specific to the shoe industry. Shoe factories making good quality leather shoes are not really common, I probably visited most of the European ones. You are also right when you say that multi-national brands use contractors and sometimes they pick the cheapest one but fortunately it's not always the case. For example, Brooks Brothers had some of its shoes made by the Zarco factory in Portugal. In term of quality and quantity it's probably one of the 5 best factories in Europe. Also, some countries are really improving. India for example is starting to produce some pretty good shoes (on par with some of the European brands sometimes). So I wouldn't necessarily discard a brand because of its multi-national status or because of the manufacturing country, but that's probably an advice for the folks who already have a bit of background and know how to recognise good quality leather/shoes.

False,cockwomblez,,,[],,,,text,"&gt; He is well known to have hated the spitzenkandidat method due to it stripping away powers from the Council

Yes, the point of the spitzenkandidaten was to connect the election of the Commission President - the executive, to the election of the EU parliament. Previously this was done behind closed doors and the choice was disconnected from the results of the EU parliamentary elections.

&gt; having a shaky basis in EU law at that point

Not really, the Lisbon treaty amended the text of the treaties so that Article 17.7 TEU read  the Commission candidate ""shall be **elected** by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members"", whereas previously Article 214 TEC (under the Nice reforms) had merely stipulated ""approved"".  

Not only is there not another way to signify that the European Parliament ""elects"" the head of the executive, rather than merely ""approves"" other than a process like the Spitzenkandiaten reforms, the language used in the Constitutional Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conferences for the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty make clear that the Commission President should be the result of an open race linked to the EU parliamentary elections.

&gt; No it is down to a plurality in the European Parliament. 

No it is not. The Spitzenkandidaten process merely stipulates that the party with a plurality **has the first attempt** of being nominated by the Council and then elected by the European Parliament by a majority of its members. If no majority exists in the EU parliament, then the Council has 1 month, under treaty rules, to propose a new candidate. If it is clear that the spitzenkandiaten from the party with a plurarity is not going to get a majority then the Council does not even have to bother nominating them, and can go to the next largest party, etc. The spitzenkandiaten process would indicate that the Council would go exhaustively through the ""lead candidate"" choices of each Europarty until a majority is found in the parliament. This is EXACTLY analogous to how almost all parliamentary systems work, particularly Germany and states with PR legislatures that are used to having no party with a majority. The opposition to the Spitzenkanidaten process was a rearguard action from certain governments/figures trying to reopen a settled question.

&gt; Bommeleeër scandal

The Bommeleeër scandal isn't a scandal. I don't know what you know about it, but its essentially got more of the aurau of an urban myth/legend, involving several bomb hoaxes in Luxembourg in the 80's - which as far as I know Juncker isn't linked to.

&gt; the illegal wire tapping scandal

Yes, his chief of his intelligence service illegaly recorded meetings with Juncker and several other prominent Luxembourgers over a decade, and Juncker was accused of not having enough supervision over what they were getting up to.

&gt;  largely unknown outside of his own country.

Every EU politician is unknown in the UK. The UK doesn't report EU politics. There was a series of pan-EU televised debates for the election of the Commission President, but as you know, the UK parties stayed quiet about it, and UK media didn't report or show these on prime-live spots if at all.

&gt; federalist

Ohhh. Scary, the ""F"" word. Though, that is a legitimate reason for Cameron to oppose him, yes.

&gt; not just the spitzenkandidat process.

And he might have had more support if he hadn't framed it under opposition to a process that many saw as a breath of fresh air. Indeed, other leaders almost supported him until their own domestic national parties said they didn't want to undermine their colleagues in the European Parliament. If say, the ACER, the Europarty of the UK conservatives had proposed a candidate rather than fighting a rear guard action and sulking in the corner, they might have been able to frame it as compromise or ""modernisation"" candidate.


Edit: Oh, and lastly, the spitzekandiaten process in no way ""breaches the principle of subsidiarity"", I don't think you understand what  subsidiarity is. It's the principle of taking actions at the lowest level of governance unless justified. It is, in fact, a principle that worked its way into the treaties thanks to federalists, you may be shocked to hear. It is a federalist principle.

&gt; RIGA, Latvia - When the U.S. hit North Korea with sanctions last year, Pyongyang&amp;#039;s state-owned banks found a quiet backchannel to keep money flowing to the country&amp;#039;s ballistic missile programs, the U.S. says: the tiny European country of Latvia.

&gt; Latvia has come into focus as a potential weak link in the West&amp;#039;s banking system as the U.S. and EU increasingly rely on financial sanctions as a weapon in their diplomatic spats - with North Korea, but also Russia and Syria, among others.

&gt; Another complicating factor in Latvia&amp;#039;s bid to clean up its image is that the official in charge of detailing to the U.S. how Latvia is fighting financial crime has a history of working for banks that engaged in money-laundering.

&gt; BERLIN - The U.S. military has held preliminary discussions about moving a powerful missile defense system to Germany to boost European defenses, according to two sources familiar with the issue, a move that experts said could trigger fresh tensions with Moscow.

&gt; The tentative proposal to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Europe predates U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, and comes amid a broader push to strengthen Europe&amp;#039;s air and missile defenses.

&gt; Deploying another U.S. defensive system to Europe could reassure NATO allies in southern Europe already within striking range of Iran&amp;#039;s missiles, said one military official from that region.

False,ripinpeppers,,,[],,,,text,"There will always be a difference between what a person's ideals are (their religion, or the things they aspire to), the things they say (or write), and they things they do. It may be naive, but I take the writings that I listed at face value and try to look for the same in the people that I vote for. Jefferson had a complicated history, but I don't think its 100% fair to hold people in the past to the values we have today. Yes the 3/5ths compromise is one of the most disgusting politically expediant things to have happen in the history of the US, but the country indisputably improved as time goes on. Millions of Americans have died to free oppressed people around the world - again, sometimes shitty wars have also been fought, but at one point half of the United States went to war with the other half because they wouldn't let them keep owning other people as property (no matter what the South says, the civil war was about slavery. And there were abolitionists who went to war *explicitly* to free the slaves.) Our views change as time goes on. I would say, forgive the people in the past for the awful shit they did if their descendants fight to undo the injustice because of what they wrote. Don't forget what they did, but don't tear down the statue of a person like Lincoln or Jefferson just because they had some skeletons in the closet.

There are plenty of problems in the world right now but, for humanity in general, I think we are much better off in 2018 with the US around than if we had never declared independence and a separate timeline sprang off in 1776. The ideals espoused in those foundational documents (personal freedom and liberty are paramount) are what I think we should aspire to... that's why I included the Gettysburg Address along with those other papers, because although Lincoln originally believed *what was being taught in Universities at the time*, (that Africans were somehow different biologically to Europeans,) his views evolved and he ended up freeing the slaves. Personal freedom and liberty is the ideal that freed the slaves, gave the right to vote to everyone, equalized marriage rights, etc. 

If you look at the history of the United States compared to any other nation state in the history of planet earth, we have liberated more peoples (civil war, WW1, WW2) emancipated more peoples (civil war, WW2, Cold War) and given more freedom (sufferage, civil rights, gay rights, personal liberties) to more people than any other nation. If you disagree with that, please give another country that has done more? Great Britain probably comes closest but they were far more of an imperialist empire in their past than the US ever was, and if it weren't for Woodrow Wilson and FDR they probably could still be an empire. So if you apply the historical relativism principle equally then the US is by far the best on that front. We haven't done it alone, it hasn't always been perfect, and it hasn't always applied to everyone equally, but I think the structures and institutions of the United States allow for positive change for personal liberty and freedom in a way that isn't guaranteed like it is in the Bill of Rights and other US founding documents. If we didn't live up to the ideal of ""all men are created equal"" when the United States was founded, then we certainly are doing a better job of that now. ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others"" because up until the 20th century every government on Earth, including the US, was unbelievably oppressive by today's standards.

False,Zeuvembie,,,[],,,,text,"There exist in our history terrible evils. The Holocaust, the Trail of Tears, the Rape of Nanking, the Rwandan Genocide - the scope and terribleness of which it is almost impossible to convey, because individual lives disappear in a tumult of statistics. And they are, without exception, very *human* evils. Whatever your belief system, whatever the context for the events, these are not instances of supernatural horror or divine judgement. Hitler did not destroy Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, and Satan did not sign the orders that sent millions of European Jews, homosexuals, Roma, etc. to concentration camps, or forcibly relocate Native Americans thousands of miles to reservations. These are events which are solely and uniquely outside the realm of fantasy; they are the stark and terrible reality which we still deal with today.

Speculative fiction breaches the rules of what is known. Sometimes the writer(s) create an entirely new world, populated with people that have never and will never exist, that follows different rules - however familiar some aspects of their lives might be, they are at best parallels and allegories. Hitler-analogues may appear in these worlds alongside Christ-parallels. For every White Witch there may be a lion.

Other stories are set in a world like our own - one with a similar history, albeit with some fantastical elements. This is the realm of Harry Potter, and the DC and Marvel universes. Worlds which are recognizable as our own, but with something more or different. And the inclusion of some fantastic element in such a setting *does* impact the world, or it should, if the world is built worth a damn. Because readers ask questions; they theorize, extrapolate, and sometimes calculate. And sometimes those questions are hard to answer.

Because from a narrative viewpoint, the reason to use the world we know is *because* we know it, to draw from the common-day a realism and verisimilitude which would be difficult to manufacture from scratch, unless you're a Tolkien who enjoys nothing more than crafting new languages and drawing maps and weaving a story around them to fit. And that means that your world cannot differ *too much* from what is known...but it also tends to equip certain individuals with the ability to affect greater change on the world than normal. And that, in itself, causes the issue you've noticed.

Why did the Holocaust happen in Harry Potter? J. K. Rowling has never answered this; maybe she never will. We can only speculate. In many settings, such as the DC and Marvel universe, it is required that World War II unfold largely as it did because otherwise the world would diverge too much from the one we know - so they make excuses. Hitler had the Spear of Destiny, which prevented DC's heroes from engaging the Nazis directly, instead dealing largely with spies and saboteurs at home; or Hitler was the target of multiple occult forces, but superfolk were too rare and few to much affect the course of the war - and it is thanks to Allied groups like Captain America and the Invaders that the Nazi's efforts to utilize their unusual assets more thoroughly were thwarted.

Yet there is one more key that is common to most of these settings - the preservation of these horrors as a uniquely *human* evil. The Trail of Tears did not happen because a black magician mind-controlled Andrew Jackson so he could complete his infernal pact and gain immortality; the Rwandan genocide was not the result of aliens psychically possessing child soldiers in a botched invasion attempt.

False,ambrofelipe,,,[],,,,text,"&gt;O governo gasta muito em juros porque gasta mais do que arrecada em impostos.

Infelizmente fizeram o favor de derrubar a atividade produtiva e, assim, a arrecadação. Sim, isso fez com que o orçamento público fosse estrangulado. Mas nossa catástrofe do estrangulamento do orçamento vem de muito antes, desde os anos de superávit. O governo gasta muito em juros porque a taxa de juros é mantida ridiculamente alta.

&gt;Não faz pouco tempo que a Dilma tentou forçar uma queda de juros e o resultado foi inflação. 

Toda a política econômica de Levy (blergh) foi de elevar juros, que chegou a 14.25% numa tentativa frustrada de controlar a inflação. Não foi isso que aconteceu?

Enfim, inflação ocorre quando a demanda e o crédito disponível são maiores que a capacidade produtiva. Isso leva muita gente às compras sem que a produção consiga suprir. Daí isso leva os preços a se elevarem pra dissuadir a demanda. Isso não é verdade? Então o Brasil, em plena recessão, com produto sobrando porque ninguém compra, tem uma inflação, mas ela não é de demanda, certo?

O Brasil não tem uma inflação de demanda, mas sim uma inflação de câmbio. Como você disse, o dólar sobe e por isso os produtos brasileiros importados sobem (trigo, combustíveis, remédios, tecnologias) e isso faz com que os preços de outros produtos e serviços também aumentem. Aqui estamos.

Pois bem. Baixar a taxa de juros faz com que as pessoas tenham mais acesso a crédito. Em outras palavras, faz com que o dinheiro fique mais barato. Assim, mais pessoas vão às compras, a demanda sobe e isso aumentaria uma inflação de demanda. De modo parecido, elevar a taxa de juros diminui o acesso das pessoas ao crédito, esfria a demanda e faz com que a inflação de demanda diminua. Certo?

Então, como abaixar a taxa de juros vai fazer diferença na inflação que não é causada pela demanda, mas sim pela alta do câmbio? Não faz.

&gt; Agora, porque o juros é alto?

Lobby de banco, no caso atual. É pura e simplesmente transferência de renda de quem trabalha e paga impostos para quem vive de rentismo sem pagar impostos. Simples assim. 

&gt;É alto porque poucos emprestariam pra um país que não consegue arrecadar o suficiente pra pagar as contas e receber pouco retorno por isso.

Então nós concordamos. Veja no que estamos concordando: o poder público, por meio do Banco Central, mantem a taxa de juros elevada mesmo que isso não tenha poder sobre a inflação. Os nossos governantes deliberadamente seguram a taxa de juros alta de forma que o Itaú cresceu, em pleno ano de crise, 12%. Quem mais cresceu 12% ano passado?

Isso nos leva a observar melhor a forma como o Banco Central emite títulos da dívida pública. Se a gente concorda que há corrupção na saúde, na educação, nos transportes, na infra-estrutura, na previdência, será que é absurdo imaginar que há corrupção na maior fatia do orçamento público? Não é, há muito roubo feito descaradamente.

Então, precisamos mesmo continuar com esse perfil de amortização e rolamento da dívida? Com esse perfil de juros? Você acha mesmo que se o Brasil quebrar esse ciclo, o Itaú vai fechar as portas e abandonar o país?

&gt;o problema é que pro estado reduzir a desigualdade ele aumenta a pobreza

Aqui, eu vou julgar que você digitou errado ou tomou um chá de cogumelos.

&gt;O que gera crescimento é investimento.

No mais, você se esqueceu de uma coisa só, da qual a gente já conversou: a saída, no momento, não é retomar a receita pública? Ao tirar dinheiro que vai pra banqueiro sem arrecadação e, ao invés disso, inserir na economia na forma de outros tipos de investimento, o que entra pro bolso do seu Zé arrecada e o que sai do bolso do seu Zé também arrecada. No caminho, seu Zé gera emprego, e arrecada mais.

Se o seu Zé conseguir fazer uma poupancinha, ele tem duas opções com o dinheiro dele: colocar pra render em títulos da dívida pública ou fazer uma reforma na padaria. Quiçá, abrir outra padaria. Pronto, fomentou-se a iniciativa privada, fez-se investimento e verificou-se crescimento.

Nenhuma grande economia no mundo - veja que argumento ousado, o meu - NENHUMA grande economia do mundo chegou lá sem massivo investimento público a pretexto da indústria, da saúde, de investimento militar, etc. A nossa saída, portanto, é inserir dinheiro na economia que reduza a desigualdade, aumentando a receita pública. Além disso, aumentar o investimento que desenvolva a indústria nacional.

Isso deveria ser bem claro pra você, que parou pra aprender economia. Espero que não tenha sido no mises.org.

Getting that money out is a massive pain. I've placed two orders on behalf of people at purse.io. One's already been shipped and I got paid in BTC. The other had a shipping problem - five items were shipped instead of six, and I have no idea when the sixth will ship. I don't get paid until the order is received in full.

I've created an account at Coinbase so I can exchange BTC into real currency, and have it transferred to my bank account. I've not done that yet, but it seems to be a good way to cash out on BTC.

The problem I have with purse.io is that it takes 2-3 weeks to pay out, given how long it takes to ship stuff. On one of my orders I had to pay $5 extra for shipping - I've cancelled a number of other purse.io transactions even before placing an order, as often neither shipping, nor taxes are included in whatever the purse.io buyer wants to pay. On that $100 order that was another 5% down the drain.

Oh, and the BTC rate on purse.io is atrocious. They attract buyers that want to spend their BTC by giving 15-25-30 percent discounts on Amazon. Guess who pays for the difference? That's right, I do, when I place their order. So that's already a quarter to a third of my money down the drain. That really hurts - to the point that I might give up on purse.io altogether.

I don't plan on buying from Amazon US directly for the same reason as you: high shipping fees, customs, and I live in a country with the highest VAT rate in the world. I can buy stuff on the high street for less than from Amazon US with all those add-on costs.

Though these things are hard to quantify, it's probably like picking up one Romance language if you already know another. But more like Spanish and French than Spanish and Portuguese. Similar but not *that* similar. Linguistically, Hebrew and Arabic are near neighbors. You'll have it way easier than someone starting with only an Indo-European language.

False,DOHDDY,,,[],,,,text,"***EDIT:*** just leaving this here, I just discovered that the twoway line graph has an option called connect() where one can specify a connectstyle that can be stepstair or stairstep. That means the first solution might work just as well. Also instead of putting the if statement in the predict command the regions can be separated with if statements in the twoway plot command by simply appending 3 line graphs each with an if together. In that case one can also use the ""sort"" option instead of the gsort command.  
____

There are multiple ways of achieving this. The easiest way is to simply run the regression mentioned in the title and then use the predict command to generate your estimated values separate for each group with the ""if"" option. Then you simply plot them with ""twoway line values_group1 values_group2 .... Age"".  
Colors and line patterns can be adjusted with the lp() and lc() options. And there is quite a bit of legend manipulation to be done as well. 

What you need to keep in mind is that if you don't have data points close to the jump of this function you will get a weird slope. To avoid this you can do the graph with the ""twoway function"" command but it is a bit more complex. 
Alternatively, your lecturer might use some user built ado for that bit I am not aware of one that does this for you. 
___
 Here an example with a standard dataset.  

    sysuse lifeexp.dta
    //we generate a new categorical variable similar to age group
    gen gnp2 = (gnppc&gt;1360) + (gnppc&gt;3360) + (gnppc&gt;14100)  
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2  
    predict l_eu if region ==1
    predict l_na if region ==2
    predict l_sa if region ==3
    //now we need to make sure that the data is sorted first by region and then by gnppc from small to big; otherwise you'd get lines all over the place  
    gsort region -gnppc  
    //plot data, with different line patterns, adjusted legend and y axis title
    line  l_na l_eu l_sa gnppc, lp(solid dash longdash) legend(lab(1 ""N.A."") lab(2 ""E.U. Asia"") lab(3 ""S.A."") ring(0)) yti(""Estimated life expectancy"")

Now you see that there are some weird slopes in there. Some regions also have no values for certain levels of  gnp. If that is what you need you are done. If you want to visualise the function there is a different method. What this one comes down to is basically plugging enough values for gnppc in the regression formula until the graph smooths out. 
So let's do the same with twoway function:  

    sysuse lifeexp.dta
    //we generate a new categorical variable similar to age group
    gen gnp2 = (gnppc&gt;1360) + (gnppc&gt;3360) + (gnppc&gt;14100)  
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2
    reg lexp b2.region i.gnp2, coefl
    twoway function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons], range(gnppc) lp(solid)  || function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[1.region] , range(gnppc) lp(dash) || function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[3.region] , range(gnppc) lp(longdash)||, xti(""GNP per capita"") yti(""Estimated life expectancy at birth"") legend(label(1 ""North America"") label( 2 ""EU &amp; Asia"" )  label( 3 ""South America"" ) ring(0))

So these are actually 3 twoway functions appended. I'll explain one of them the rest just work the same.  
function y =  _b[1.gnp2]*(x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) + _b[2.gnp2]*(x&gt;3360 &amp; x&lt;14100) + _b[3.gnp2]*(x&gt;14100) +_b[_cons] + _b[1.region] , range(gnppc)  
simply put it takes the estimated coefficients from the regression - the ""_b[whatever]"" (you can see how to access those if you run the regression with the coeflegend option) and multiplies them with a condition statement in parenthesis. ""x"" refers to gnppc, so (x&gt;1360 &amp; x&lt;3360) simply evaluates to 1 if the value of gnppc is between 1360 and 3360 and otherwise it is 0. This simply means that only the coefficient where the conditional statement evaluates to 1 actually counts towards our function. Then we add the constant term and the term for the region we are interested in. Lastly, we define what ""x"" means with the range option. It automatically checks what the min and max values are and then generates 300 equally stepped values for x (you can specify more if necessary).

I've yet to find a series with an EU that isn't mainly junk. It's all like, really niche stuff.

Native Americans in North and South-America. Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Never forget any of those, just because there are no movies about them!)

from Wikipedia about Hiroshima and Nagasaki:
""Frequent estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, though the number which died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. ""

And in the aftermath there was rise in cancer deaths and other health issues. Nobody knows how many, that can easily be several 100 thousands that at least suffered in the aftermath.

Seriously that's what the entire first half of your argument sounds like. 

&gt;It doesn't matter how cool or unique a power transfer mechanic is, people will always go for the most boring one.

There is a buttload of modpacks out there that discourage the use to the simplest way, just look at all of the HQM packs. I regularly see people showing off their Rube Goldberg-esque builds.

If someone want's magic cables for your mod, they will get them, people who want to go the easy route will find a way. Maybe that means downloading a ""MagicCable for BordListian' Mod"" Mod but it will exist and it will be used.

However by creating compatibility between the big mods with actually interesting features you might get to see an IC2 nuclear reactor powering a BC quarry.

&gt;Passive Generation is useful

yes it is, and excluding it as a viable method of generation, because it is lazy, is just stupid. That's like saying food is dumb noone is allowed to use it in a mod. I too am no fan of 500k RF/t passive generation, that's why I don't use them. 

OP mods will always exist. And cutting yourself of from collaboration with other quality mods stops noone from creating op items for your mod.

All this does, is hurt your mod and the people who want to play with it.

I too don't want Forge Energy as the official name for MC electricity, because yes, it sounds stupid. But why not RF or MJ those are actually cool names.

Finally:  let me research EU and MJ, I am not sure what distinctions there are. I know they both have ""voltage"" in the form of units/tick.

Edit: Yea, so the only gameplay difference of EU/MJ to RF is the 'voltage' Which should be absolutely no problem to simulate in the FE environment by monitoring FE/t.

* Our first Capital was Salvador, then Rio, and now it's Brasilia
* We are named after a tree (Pau-Brasil). It was heavily extracted by portuguese because of its red color (Brasa is portuguese for 'burning coal')

* Feijoada (beans with pork meat)
* Pão de queijo ('cheese-bread')  
* Guaraná (soft drink)
* Brigadeiro (a chocolate candy)
* Açaí (kinda like ice cream)
* Acarajé (a fried ""ball"", usually stuffed with shrimp)

&gt; My fellow Americans:
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; This week, as we prepared for Thanksgiving, Canada held an important election, and I'm pleased to again send my congratulations to Prime Minister Mulroney. One of the important issues in the Canadian election was trade. And like our own citizens earlier this month, our neighbors have sent a strong message, rejecting protectionism and reaffirming that more trade, not less, is the wave of the future.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. In 1776 our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, charging the British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote, ``cutting off our trade with all parts of the world,'' end quote.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; And that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched another revolution with a book entitled ``The Wealth of Nations,'' which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism. Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; America's most recent experiment with protectionism was a disaster for the working men and women of this country. When Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930, we were told that it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in this country -- the same line we hear today. The actual result was the Great Depression, the worst economic catastrophe in our history; one out of four Americans were thrown out of work. Two years later, when I cast my first ballot for President, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who opposed protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent years, the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined. The record is clear that when America's total trade has increased, American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has declined, so have the number of jobs.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Yet today protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies -- countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends -- weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; After the Second World War, America led the way to dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth. And in one week, when important multilateral trade talks are held in Montreal, we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system. We want to open more markets for our products, to see to it that all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas as dispute resolution and agriculture. We also want to bring the benefits of free trade to new areas, including services, investment, and the protection of intellectual property. Our negotiators will be working hard for all of us.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, back in 1776, our Founding Fathers believed that free trade was worth fighting for. And we can celebrate their victory because today trade is at the core of the alliance that secure the peace and guarantee our freedom; it is the source of our prosperity and the path to an even brighter future for America.

When Muhammad gained power and conquered Mecca, he smashed the idols and ended their religion.

They effectively ended Zoroastrianism in Persia by sword and blood, by destroying their temples and killing their priests. When they moved to places like modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, India etc. they invaded the temples there and demolished the religions they saw as ""mushrik"" or Pagan. Those religions, the priests of those religions claimed they had the truth, but they got annihilated. If Frank army didn't stop Muslim invaders at Europe, they would've conquered all the way to Rome and probably killed the pope and destroyed the Christianity.

The author appears to be demonstrating the different attitudes towards church and religion in Europe and America, and how important church communities are to many Americans. I don't get the sense that they have an agenda to prove atheists aren't really atheists at all, personally. When they refer to ""Nones"", they're referring to not only atheists, but also anyone who doesn't practice organized religion, which includes many who still believe in a god, just not God™.

False,blackmagic70,,,[],,,,text,"A FURORE erupted in Britain in April when the effect of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy on Caribbean migrants who came to Britain after the second world war was revealed. Well before the scandal broke, the British Library had been finalising an exhibition to explore the experiences of the “Windrush generation” 70 years after their arrival in London. Titled “Windrush: Songs in a Strange Land”, the exhibition, which opens on June 1st, will focus on political, literary and musical voices from the Caribbean, revisiting colonialism through the stories of people who experienced it. It prompts questions about how people from the former empire have in turn shaped Britain. 

This is part of a broader movement in the visual arts. Calls to revisit historical narratives in museums to make room for the perspectives of those who were colonised have grown louder in recent years. Groups of activists seek to identify the Western bias involved in cultural heritage and shame institutions into redressing it. As such, the activists ask provocative questions about who owns culture.

These debates spurred a group of young museum professionals from different minority and immigrant groups to form Museum Detox in 2016. Their aim is to build awareness around diversity in cultural organisations, to build a network and to help members achieve leadership positions. Their inaugural event, in October that year, was a flash mob at the Museum of London. It saw some 60 black and minority-ethnic museum workers disrupt “Punk.London”, an exhibition marking 40 years of punk and its legacy. The flash mob fittingly caused anarchy by raiding the show with cards and texts about African and Caribbean culture. By linking the artefacts with personal stories and facts about migration, Museum Detox offered an alternative view of the collection.

The previous day gal-dem, a collective of ethnic-minority women, had also staged a cultural coup at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Commandeering Friday Late, the museum’s monthly contemporary-arts series, they encouraged visitors to take alternative tours of the galleries. Rather than seeing the European artefacts and sculptures that dominate its main collections and the vast halls of its Cast Courts, they would focus on black and Middle Eastern women’s performances, histories and objects. The idea was that these should be central, not peripheral, to a museum visit. 

Activists argue that museums are not solely concerned with art and design: they also make statements about identity and belonging in their countries. In February the British Museum, in collaboration with the BBC’s reprised “Civilisations” series, hosted lectures on the topic; curators talked candidly about the difficult provenance of their collections and how to present it to the public. In the original 1960s television series, Kenneth Clark, a celebrated art historian, travelled through Europe feting Western art. This time, three presenters explored the arts of Africa, Asia and the Americas as rich civilisations that can stand with the Greeks and the Romans. Mary Beard, a celebrated classicist, considered perspective: through design histories from Mexico and Greece to Egypt and China, she focused on the human body as a way of framing the discussion of what is considered “civilised”.

Scrutiny of the canon is extending to universities, too. Non-Western academics and thinkers are sharing their “decolonising syllabi” and discussing the subject online. Last year undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge petitioned to diversify their English-literature curriculum with non-Western voices. At Cambridge, in an open letter to the head of the English faculty, students said they want to change a syllabus which they feel “elevates white male authors at the expense of all others”. They stated that while strides had been made to include women writers, “the curriculum, taken as a whole, risks perpetuating institutional racism.” Students suggested more post-colonial authors in exam papers, more diversified speakers at the university and “a zero-tolerance policy on the dismissal of race as a subject worthy of discussion/enquiry in essays”. The faculty have entered into discussions with the students to address their concerns. 

While museums may not be moving towards total decolonisation and returning artworks and artefacts to their country of origin, activists’ pressure can push institutions to be more transparent about provenance. Curators could likewise encourage more nuanced interpretations of collections by juxtaposing canonical works, where appropriate, with artefacts and ephemera. A more diverse workforce may help to deliver those new ideas and approaches. That will be to museums’ benefit. As the Windrush scandal has proven, the story of British colonialism is still being told.

Du coup les anglophones de naissance sont avantagés dans plein de domaines par rapport à ceux qui pratiquent d'autres langues. C'est pareil pour le français.

En europe par exemple, l'angleterre gagne des milliards grâce à ça, et tous les autres pays d'europe dépensent des milliards pour pouvoir apprendre l'anglais à leur population.

it blew up the deficit, taxed grad students unreasonable amounts while letting private jets go free, and I'm already bored talking about it. As for the first part I do believe their credit for it was restricted, but also that they put more effort into getting it passed.

Il resto è comunque costretto a confrontarsi con della competizione che ha a disposizione lo stesso accesso agli strumenti che hanno gli attuali vincitori. Era più pericoloso Berlusconi quando aveva il controllo delle televisioni in un periodo pre-internet in tal senso.

Il problema è che, in realtà, per la ""Bubble Democracy"", è più probabile che persone che la pensano allo stesso modo entrino in contatto tra loro, si informino dalle stesse fonti e così via. Nel momento in cui una buona parte della popolazione segue questi due schieramenti e contemporaneamente disdegna i mezzi di informazioni tradizionali come ""strumenti del sistema"", per quanto si possano riportare fatti questi li negheranno e li vedranno come un modo per infangare e destabilizzare il movimento a cui sentono di appartenere.
Paradossalmente, con Berlusconi la situazione era migliore (o meno peggio) perché metà del paese gli si era compattata contro. In questo caso, metà paese si è compattata dentro a questi due movimenti, mentre l'altra metà è fratturata in maniera (temo) insanabile nel breve periodo.

&gt; Per Leone parliamo del periodo dell'assassinio di Moro, per la cui gestione fu pesantemente criticato, e dello scandalo Lockheed. Parliamo di periodo abbastanza caldo politicamente, e in cui la stabilità dell'impianto statale era tutto fuorché scontata.
Cossiga fu presidente nel periodo in cui, con la fine della Guerra Fredda, gli USA tolsero il supporto incondizionato alle forze anti-comuniste in Italia e le indagini di Falcone e sua morte, altro periodo che definirei tutt'altro che stabile, probabilmente più di quello attuale.
Oggi abbiamo sicuramente una crisi del sistema partitico, ma non vedo quello istituzionale in particolare difficoltà: le richieste dei 5 stelle sono per un sistema più vicino al presidenziale o quantomeno con più controllo da parte dell'elettorato sul lavoro delle istituzioni (si parlava addirittura di qualche forma di vincolo di mandato), non di abbattere il sistema intero.

Guarda, per gli studi che ho fatto posso dirti con un certo grado di sicurezza che siamo messi peggio adesso che in entrambi i casi precedenti. Nel caso di Leone:

- Il sistema partitico era ancora molto forte
- La posizione dell'Italia nel blocco occidentale garantiva stabilità (seppur eteroguidata per ragioni di Guerra Fredda)
- Il sistema istituzionale era ancora giovane ed adatto a quella realtà.

Nel caso di Cossiga, invece:

- Il sistema partitico (seppur entrato nella fase iniziale della sua crisi) era ancora forte.
- L'apertura ai post-comunisti non ha creato instabilità perché il processo in Italia era già iniziato quando Berlinguer teorizzò l'Eurocomunismo e iniziò a metterlo in pratica.
- Il sistema istituzionale iniziava a mostrare i primi segni di fatica, ma si adattava ancora alla realtà politico-partitica di quegli anni.

Oggi, invece:

- Il sistema partitico è palesemente in crisi
- Forze populiste hanno la maggioranza e stanno governando da sole (perché non c'è un partner più moderato. E penso sia il primo caso per un paese dell'Europa occidentale)
- Il sistema istituzionale ormai è vetusto e non più adatto alla realtà politica che dovrebbe regolare. E questo è problematico perché sta dimostrando tutti i suoi limiti (così come lo fece in occasione della seconda elezione di Napolitano e tutto quello che ne conseguì).

Da analista politico (e avendoci scritto sopra una tesi), posso garantirti che il sistema politico-istituzionale più instabile è quello che in questo momento abbiamo tra le mani: un sistema parlamentare con una legge elettorale fondamentalmente proporzionale in cui i partiti sono deboli. Tutti gli ingredienti per il disastro ci sono (e paradossalmente, una riforma in senso presidenziale sarebbe particolarmente rischiosa in un momento come quello attuale).

&gt; Quanto alle soluzioni odierne, basta dare un occhio al vicino d'oltralpe che più ci rassomiglia: in Francia, che soffre della nostra stessa storica sfiducia nelle istituzioni e paralisi da costante protesta di tutti contro tutti, Macron è riuscito a raccogliere la maggioranza dietro di sè creando un'offerta che mescola idee che si sarebbero descritte come sia di destra che di sinistra, e la solita resistenza al cambiamento, impersonata dagli scioperi paralizzanti, non ha più il supporto della maggioranza della popolazione che in passato aveva.

E su questo, purtroppo, non posso essere assolutamente d'accordo. Quella di Macron è una ""Terza Via 2.0"" che ha mirato a raccogliere intorno a sé l'elettorato moderato. Sappiamo tutti però che i risultati della ""Terza Via"" per quanto efficaci nel breve periodo, sul medio lungo facciano più male che bene. Specialmente se guardiamo alla realtà europea, dove è passata la ""Terza Via"", si è creato il vuoto dopo.
Tra l'altro, se Macron si dovesse bruciare (cosa non così improbabile) non ci sarebbe un altro leader pronto a raccogliere il testimone e quindi le due forze che avrebbero buone probabilità di arrivare al ballottaggio sarebbero (paradossalmente) la sinistra radicale e la destra radicale.

Su tutto il discorso regionale (che non sto a quotare per comodità) sono d'accordo solo parzialmente. Le politiche Glocal hanno senso fino ad un certo punto, ma è assurdo pensare in un mondo sempre più globalizzato che le risposte principali possano arrivare da dimensioni locali. Si rischierebbe di rincorrere i fantasmi del regionalismo, anziché quelli del nazionalismo in un mondo che va ad una velocità folle.

&gt; Concordo, in fin dei conti nel parallelo che avevo proposto credo solo fino ad un certo punto, e cioè che l'attuale situazione sia dominata da forze centrifughe, non centripete come furono quelle che portarono poi ad un accentramento di potere.

Veramente dal 2009 si è assistito ad un nuovo accentramento dei poteri per far fronte alla crisi. Il problema non è stato tanto quello, quanto il fatto che si sia accentrato a livello intermedio (quello nazionale) e non a quello più elevato (quello europeo).",True,False,0,1527881393,,False,0,dzyh5dy,False,t3_8npkto,True,t1_dzyfgqn,/r/italy/comments/8npkto/casual_friday_habemus_governum_edition/dzyh5dy/,,1532095064,markdown,2,False,True,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

But that's not really the fault of the game its self, its mostly just there not being any good matchmaking/Elo right now. It would be the same in CS:GO if you were just matched against randoms.

And I agree that its sad that private servers aren't open to everyone yet. There are places you can scrim though if you want to. There's a huge amount of minor tournaments out there that you can use to practice too. And like you mentioned, Hotdrop.gg which was created to solve both of those problems. (That there is no good matchmaking and that there is a lack of opportunity to scrim). It will get much easier for people to experience competitive gameplay in the future.

If you think that the scene was ""manufactured"" or only based on money, you couldn't be further from the truth. The online leagues and most of the current top players already existed before any of the big teams came in and picked up teams. It is very much something grass roots that grew organically. TSM is an oddity in that they are mostly streamers that got picked up.  Almost all of the other teams were picked up because they showed results. They placed high in the online league seasons. Those leagues have always had open qualifiers each season too.

And there have been very few tournaments so far that are invite only. Starladder is the only one I can think of. Almost every big LAN event has open qualifiers. For example, the $100.000 tournament running this weekend had no invites, only qualifiers. PGI is the same. In the two most recent European qualifiers to events like this, over 1000 teams have participated.

&gt; And all the complete bs. about ""tactics"", to make up for inability. You only need one guy to do that, the rest can be mad fraggers - actually able to clear areas. 

The best teams have actually turned out to be those where there isn't one set in game leader but where everyone makes calls. The game is so dependent on reacting correctly to new unique situations and gathering information about opposing team positions and movements is so crucial that you can't really rely on just one person to make calls. You need to let whoever sees an opportunity to call it out right away.

While tactics are important in the game, strategy always trumps it. What differentiates the absolute best teams from the middle tier is neither aim nor their ability to flank and engage opponents correctly. The biggest difference is how they approach rotations, routing, timings and scouting. How they decide to move in each circle and how the position themselves given what they know about enemy positions. FaZe is by far the most consistent team and have been so for a year now. What they excel at is exactly this. That is how you manage to turn decent circles into good ones and bad circles into decent ones.

That said, you obviously need to have good mechanics too. But everyone in the pro scene is a good aimer. It just end up mattering less than the strategic side of the game since the difference between the teams is smaller when it comes to mechanics, so its harder to stand out.

Just shows how low the standards were in the US when he got his first gig. He does quite a good job acting as though he knows what it's like being successful at the top level. When he's commentating a game, his arrogance is the epitome of why Americans are so bad at it when it comes to soccer. He and a handful of others spend a large portion of their time critiquing players while commentating. As an American who grew up watching the EPL, one of the things that's quite noticeable in the commentating is the optimism that they use when they talk and to not point out what someone did wrong every time a mistake happens. Listening to the likes of Martin Tyler, Jon Champion, Andy Gray, and Clive Tilsdey can really bring the passion out from a game and its a shame that we can't have this in US. Part of me thinks that the US commentators are unable to switch between commentating and analyzing a game while the other thinks that they are bitter which is why they are quick to critique. They could also have a superiority complex being on TV and forgot that their none of their careers have done anything at the top level. Sorry.

&gt; *A former school teacher, Mussolini’s spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini ""instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivalled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed"". As for the scope and spending on social welfare programs, Italian fascism ""compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive""*

&gt;*By 1925, the Fascist government had ""embarked upon an elaborate program"" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance. As for public works, the Mussolini's administration ""devoted 400 million lire of public monies"" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922*

&gt; Se te ocurren tres medidas concretas (no 'no negocies con X', medidas económicas concretas - monetaria, de importaciones o exportaciones, lo que fuera) para bajar la inflación y que crezca la economía?

Te lo dejo a Joseph Stiglizt, premio nobel de economia, que probablemente lo va a explicar mejor que yo.

&gt; *Lo que en cambio se ha articulado, principalmente desde el Banco Central, es una visión chata en la que el foco de la política macro se pone casi exclusivamente en bajar la inflación, y que eso generará un conjunto de condiciones que serán disparadoras del crecimiento. Claro que bajar la inflación importa, pero que el Banco Central se circunscriba a eso como objetivo único hace daño. No termina logrando lo que busca, y es lógico, porque la inflación no es sólo un fenómeno monetario en el corto plazo. Es un enfoque esquizofrénico: creen que porque ellos creen que la inflación es un fenómeno puramente monetario, entonces todos tienen que actuar de forma consistente con esa creencia. Pero si la gente no cree que sea así, no te van a formar precios ni aceptar paritarias que reflejen la creencia del Banco Central. Entonces terminás con dos problemas grandes: no se resuelve ni el problema de inclusión social ni el de falta de consistencia macro. Se daña la capacidad de competir de sectores que son clave para la creación de empleo en sectores sensibles de nuestra estructura demográfica, y encima la economía no despega de forma sostenible y se termina necesitando tomar deuda para poder mantenerse a flote.

False,Bartsches,,,[],,,,text,"Guess I'll be that one guy on reddit that disagrees with nuclear energy. However, I promise to argue out of an unexpected corner every now and then to make the case interesting at least.

A few years ago a visited a [VDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDE_e.V.) congress and among the future challenges discussed was the question of the shape of the energy grid in the future. Ever taller cities and especially increasing automation both in private and professional settings spike the power usage density by a lot. Enough in fact to make the transport of this power into a city unfeasable ^1 for the majority of  large metropolitan areas within the next decades if I recall correctly. 

The logical answer to this is, among other things ^2, to produce as much energy locally as possible  - in the form of (to the human eye) transparent solar cells on windows for example. However, up until now our energy system had a centralized point to point layout  From the perspective of the person presenting ^3 the German Energiewende is, first and foremost, a testbed for the decentralization theory required for a number of future systems, including the energy grid, autonomous transport and Internet of Things in general. Even continued internet access hangs on these theories as with the chatter increase from smart devices even already partly decentralized system types are expecting demand above theoretical capacity very soon. In total this causes green energy to become an enabler for a number of further technologies, either being directly required, or by contributing the research in system theory needed to make them viable. As such both the one holding that presentation and the ones holding any other presentation were in favor of switching to green energy as far as it was topic despite having no misgivings against nuclear energy as a technology.

Anyway, to return to the topic and on to  more direct economic aspects, a kWh of nuclear energy is cheaper than a kWh of fossil fuels or renewables outside of fringe cases. This is only absolute if one looks exclusively at the production however. Depending on country waste management may drive the total costs way above the other two tough I lack the knowledge to really expand on this point. Other points, such as the inability to scale with low or high fluctuation demands and large minimum upfront costs are further limiters to nuclears usability.

Geopolitically, the elephant in this forum I'd wager, nuclear no doubt has its advantages as you stated. However it also has stark disadvantages. For one you are creating a point of dependency which, depending on which ir theory you describe to, leaves you exceedingly vulnerable. Say if Crimea had housed the nuclear reactors producing energy for the entirety of Ukraine without extensive backup systems in place that would have been the end of the war right there. Alternatively, if an attack on the scale of stuxnet was to be directed at powerplants (or even just transformer stations) that could make an entire county go dark.  
Further on the security issue, nuclear is a relatively mature technology with a low failure chance if maintained properly. Now, lets say Greece, a country bankrupt and with a known corruption problem had a reactor on your border. Would you trust them to maintain it? While a nuclear reactor is quite safe when operated within specifications do you trust humans to keep within these specifications at all times when a failure has the potential of annihilating a country ^4? Even if it would be perfectly safe, even against plots from hostile states or terrorists your neighbors don't know that for certain, sparking tensions as recurrently seen between Belgium and Netherlands/Germany ^5. 

--------------------------
1 This is due to a) the number of possible approaches being restricted by terrain or existing high value assets  in many cases and b) due to a limit of how much energy thoughput you can realistically achieve per land diameter before either having any additional energy lost in transit or getting into really nasty failure states or other unacceptable influences.

2 Intelligent load distribution utilizing Internet of Things triggers (force automated washing machines to wash at night or other low demand times, possibly steered by load calibrated energy prices for example) and skyscrapers with inbuild short term energy storage and so on.

3 Germany chief of a global player. No names though, purely for my memory wanting to mix names and faces and I don't wish to wrongly attribute statements.

4 It has come to my attention that the potential damage of an actual incident is often misunderstood on reddit, with it being seen somewhat like a car crash that kills those involved and forces you to drive down the next street at most.  
Within western Europe at least, and this differs from countries with alot of suitable nothing to put their reactors into, a large fallout cloud may very well be the end of countries even when not considering immediate disaster relief requirements and health damage. The reason here is that in economical terms it wipes out alot of real estate that would have been in use before. This not only stops whatever parts of your gpd that plot of land was sitting on put also any gpd part of a supply chain going through there. Given the location requirements of a nuclear reactor nuclear contamination also has an increased chance of disabling harbours and navigable waters. And besides external effects like having the still usable parts gobbled up mighty quickly one way or the other by other countries or your credit rating inventing a new rank in such an event, losing large parts of ones gdp instantly would disable your ability to sustain your government internally.

&gt;Toxic masculinity

&gt;The concept of toxic masculinity is used in psychology and gender studies to refer to certain norms of masculine behavior in North America and Europe that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. Other stereotypically masculine traits, such as self-reliance and emotional repression, are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse.

So at its core it is a useful concept.  It's about teaching men that it's ok to ask for help and to show emotion, and it's also useful to teach society that men can be victims too.  

Basically, Toxic Masculinity is a name given to a negative stereotype of men, so education and awareness of the stereotype should in theory help prevent discrimination against men.

I am a diehard lifelong star wars fan who has consumed most of the EU, all the cartoon series and even liked the prequels more than most, because i thought star wars is like what they say about pizza or sex; even if its bad, it's still good. I was shocked and disappointed at TLJ, but even more shocked and disappointed at the fanbase. I used to visit this subreddit every day, and the supposed frothing hatred that headlines said was to be coming from an alt-right woman-hating portion of the fans seemed to me to be coming instead from the parade of white knights defending the brand. I had to stop visiting here because rather than finding an honest discussion about the paper-thin plot and genuinely surprising character choices that were made, i found a daily barrage of people 'defending the wall' like their lives depended on it.

False,HaLoGuY007,,USA,[],2761ea4e-7422-11e7-94f4-0e4502cfd6bc,,dark,text,"&gt; As Italy’s financial elite gathered on Tuesday morning in Palazzo Koch, the 19th century building in central Rome that houses the Bank of Italy, they had every reason to be glued to the words of the governor Ignazio Visco. Italian shares were plunging and bond yields were rising sharply — as a stand-off between Italy’s establishment and upstart political parties enveloped the eurozone’s third-largest economy and raised questions about the very future of the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; In a speech, Mr Visco, the 68-year old Neapolitan economist, offered some reassurance about the solidity of the Italian economy, now in its fourth full year of economic growth and insisted the country’s “destiny” was in Europe. But he also warned that the country ran a “serious risk” of frittering away the “irreplaceable asset of trust” if it made the wrong moves in the weeks ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; “We are on razor’s edge,” says one senior Italian banker.
&gt; 
&gt; By Friday the immediate crisis had been averted, with the afternoon swearing-in of the populist government led by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.
&gt; 
&gt; But the final week of the longest political stalemate in Italian postwar history has also demonstrated the potential for major ructions in the near future, from the prospect of another swift and acute loss of confidence in Italy’s finances to the looming confrontation between the new government and Brussels.
&gt; 
&gt; After separate electoral campaigns that seized on the country’s sluggish recovery, anger at immigration and disgust at the traditional political class, Five Star and the League have joined forces to try to defy the EU and overhaul a wide range of rules they blame for many of the country’s troubles. Their main aim is to challenge the fiscal constraints that govern the single currency in order to implement a package of tax cuts and spending increases.
&gt; 
&gt; While both Five Star and the League insist they are not considering Italy leaving the euro — a U-turn from previous positions — their combative approach towards Brussels threatens a profound rift with the EU and large member states including France and Germany. “This is a new historical era, it will be a very complicated path,” says Sergio Fabbrini, professor of political science at Luiss University in Rome. “What does it mean to be within the eurozone while being permanently critical of the eurozone?”
&gt; 
&gt; By Friday, Italian assets had bounced back as investors judged that having the League-Five Star government in place with a slim majority was a better alternative to another election in the autumn, prolonging the uncertainty and probably further boosting the two populist parties.
&gt; 
&gt; But the mix of aggressive rhetoric, political posturing and outlandish policy proposals that emerged during the past month of intrigue in the Roman palazzos serves as a cautionary tale for the months ahead as Five Star and the League take charge. Since starting serious talks in early May following a two-month long stalemate, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old Five Star leader, and Matteo Salvini, the 45-year-old League chief, considered, then retreated from, plans to create a path for Italy to leave the single currency and ask the European Central Bank to cancel €250bn in Italian debt.
&gt; 
&gt; After a stand-off over who should be prime minister, the pair plucked Giuseppe Conte, a little-known 53-year professor and civil lawyer, out of obscurity to lead their alliance. And when Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, used his powers to veto Paolo Savona, their choice of finance minister, because of his staunchly Eurosceptic views, they lashed out at the head of state, calling for mass protests as if they were victims of a coup. “This is not a free democracy if we are in this shape,” Mr Di Maio said. “It’s useless for us to vote if governments are decided by ratings agencies and financial and banking lobbies. It’s always the same people who decide who governs,” he added.
&gt; 
&gt; From the establishment viewpoint, the dispute over Mr Savona exposed the new government’s naivety. “Mattarella has tried to make them mature, but they haven’t matured,” says the senior Italian banker. “These people don’t know what they are saying — they created a blueprint of impossible dreams.”
&gt; 
&gt; The cleavage between the elite and the political upstarts is nowhere more apparent than in northern Italy. In Milan, Italy’s finance and business capital, bankers and business leaders were angered by the rout in the markets as a result of this week’s political crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; In contrast to the rest of the country, the banking and fashion hub has been living a Gilded Age it has not seen since the 1980s. Milan’s economy grew 6.2 per cent from 2014 to 2017, double the national average, and is now above pre-crisis levels, according to data from regional business group Assolombarda.
&gt; 
&gt; Central Milan’s residents, which include billionaire industrialists, fashion moguls, banking and legal bosses and television stars, voted overwhelmingly in the March election for the governing centre-left Democratic party.
&gt; 
&gt; The prospect that financial instability and battles with Brussels could put at risk this period of prosperity led to a remarkable response from Milan’s political leadership in the form of an open letter signed by every mayor of the city over the past 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; “We affirm with great conviction our belief in European values,” the mayors, who stretch from the left to the conservative League itself, wrote in the letter. “It is absolutely wrong to even put in doubt the participation of our country in the great European community.”
&gt; 
&gt; But outside of Milan, with its glitzy skyscraper bank headquarters, the mood is far different: the Five Star-League coalition is entering government with broad support from the Italian electorate.
&gt; 
&gt; Even in Veneto, a prosperous north-eastern region whose small and mid-sized entrepreneurs are part of Italy’s economic backbone and have close ties to Germany, the resentment towards the establishment is keenly felt — the collapse of two prominent regional banks triggered big losses among retail investors. In this region, the Democratic party was heavily defeated in the March election as both the League and Five Star strengthened their votes.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our hope is that the League and Five Star together will get us our money back,” says Walter Baseggio, a local League supporter wearing the Lion of Saint Mark, the symbol of Venice, at a café in Montebelluna, a town of 32,000 which was home to Veneto Banca, one of the collapsed banks . Lorenzo, who sports a white beard and greying hair tied back in a ponytail, wipes tears from his eyes as he speaks about the country’s traditional establishment, echoing much of the campaign rhetoric that fuelled the rise of populism in Italy.
&gt; 
&gt; “These people are so corrupt they do not care. They are a cabal who all feathered each other’s beds”, he says, naming bankers, the EU, the European Central Bank, the regulators and the outgoing centre-left government.
&gt; 
&gt; “I feel like I am stuck in Dante’s Commedia . . . All I feel in my head is rage, rage, rage,” he says. To them, the election of Five Star and the League represents a mix of justice and revenge for perceived wrongs and a fresh start.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Conte insists the Five Star-League alliance will be able to channel this voter angst, while demonstrating it can provide an effective government. But even on the eve of power and responsibility, Five Star and the League did little to tone down the harsh rhetoric — particularly on social media — that helped fuel their rise.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Salvini, who will be vice-premier and interior minister, posted a video on Thursday of a black man apparently plucking a pigeon on the street. “Go home!!!,” he wrote.
&gt; Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco reassured the financial elite that Italy's 'destiny' is in Europe © EPA
&gt; 
&gt; Italy’s centrist, pro-EU opposition, meanwhile, is trying to regroup in the hope that it can block the more radical proposals coming from the new government and exploit the contradictions and divisions that are bound to emerge between Five Star and the League.
&gt; 
&gt; Carlo Calenda, the outgoing economic development minister who recently joined the Democratic party, has called for the creation of a “Republican front” as an alternative to the populism.
&gt; 
&gt; “Salvini has contributed to fuelling tension, institutional clashes, division and fear,” he tweeted on Friday. “Now the time for chatter is over and he has a lot of work to do, for the first time in his life.”
&gt; 
&gt; In Brussels, the dilemma will be how to manage an unruly, defiant government in Rome at a time when the EU is already facing a testy conclusion to Brexit negotiations, friction with both Moscow and Washington, as well as other uncooperative member states such as Viktor Orban’s Hungary.
&gt; 
&gt; “[Italy] is quickly becoming issue number one as we head into the June European Council,” says Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group.
&gt; 
&gt; While this is exactly what Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini may have been angling for, the country’s economic and financial establishment is on the defensive again, and assessing how much damage has already been inflicted, even if this week was just a scare.
&gt; 
&gt; “Markets are now considering a new phase in which the main question is will we be in the euro or not,” says the senior banker. “If this is true it means there is a probability attached to an exit.”

&gt; Um policial militar reagiu a um assalto e matou um criminoso, no bairro Maracanã, em Cariacica, na Grande Vitória, nesta quinta-feira (31). O outro assaltante conseguiu fugir e ainda não foi localizado. O capitão da reserva, de 48 anos, estava parado no local porque ia dar uma carona a uma pessoa, mas foi abordado por dois assaltantes e reagiu, atirando em um deles, que caiu na calçada. O policial ainda correu atrás do outro criminoso e atirou, pelo menos, mais duas vezes, mas o assaltante conseguiu fugir. Já o baleado morreu no local, mas ainda não foi identificado pela polícia. De acordo com a polícia, o assaltante que conseguiu fugir era o que estava armado. Ele correu até se encontrar com um comparsa que o esperava num carro.

For example, if a burglary occurs, they will only investigate it if there was violence or if a certain amount of valuables was lost. That’s just one of many examples but the short of it is, criminals have a lot more incentive to commit crime.

Not sure why you think London is at a really good place - international crime statistics doesn’t have it at a good crime or safety index, not even in the top half, and it is probably worse now. UAE for comparison is probably top 10 for safety (a long with Japan). 

As for the NHS, if we again then the clock back to early 2000’s, sure it’s great. But now, it’s hardly world class compared to the European alternatives. They have far better systems in place.

For education, I should have clarified - I meant pre university. At university level I agree, London is world class. It was for children that I was referring to - where secondary schools and colleges are mostly rubbish. Teaching as a professor has been hit hard in the past decade so the average quality of teaching or motivated teacher is also on the decline. I wouldn’t trust my children to be getting a decent education to be honest in these classrooms in London. There are good schools, but I’d have to move outside of London.

I am in no bubble, but I understand all good things come to an end albeit temporarily (a recession period, not just economically but socially) - I’m confident UK is going to go through that and that we have yet to see the worst.

However, if you have a serious illness like cancer or heart disease, then these countries with public healthcare are the last place you want to be because not only are you going to be waiting a long time for MRI's, scans, surgeries, etc., but you also have to deal with mediocre doctors \(obviously not all of them\), because the best doctors will go to countries with private healthcare due to the incentive of a higher wage, and there's also no incentive for doctors to try to offer a great service because you can't go anywhere else, due to their being very few competitors \(given that it's so difficult to compete with a 'free' service\).

**I lied. I haven't had sex with girls from Albania, Montenegro, Moldova, Andorra, Lichtenstein, Malta or the Italian Microstates.**

I told a couple of friends that I'd had sex with girls
from every European country. I said it
offhandedly but they told other people and now
like all my friends know. I didn't have a choice so I
just went along with it and now it's a thing. But
the truth is that I still haven't had sex with girls
from all European countries yet. I've been trying
but it's pretty hard to find girls from some of the
smaller European countries unless you actually
go there and I don't have the money right now. I
traveled across Eastern Europe a couple of years
ago and checked most of the difficult ones off but
I wasn't able to them all so I have to wait until the
end of the year until I can get back there.

Tl;dr: I'm a liar.

I wanted to talk about Brexit, without actually talking about Brexit, so I focused on UK/EU relations with Heath and Wilson in the 1970's and then Cameron since about 2009 and up to his decision to call a referendum. I looked at 3 aspects during each time:

Firstly I talked about Heath and his negotiations to join the EEC, then British international diplomacy during the oil crisis, then Wilson and his negotiations to change the British terms of entry.

In the second part I looked at Cameron and his decision to withdraw the Tories from a major coalition in the European Parliament, then his negotiations with the EU over the fiscal compact treaty, and then the negotiations to change British terms of membership which ultimately lead to him to suggest a referendum. 

I tried to link this all together with a discussion of nationalism, diplomacy,and legitimacy. 

To be honest, I tried to have too much in the dissertation, and some of my different sections were a bit brief and crap. I wanted to look at the ways that the UK tried to diplomatically engage with different partners and how this impacted on their efficacy in the international sphere. 

My conclusion \(which, to be fair, was poorly written and a bit shit\) was basically that Uk and Eu diplomacy are each tied to different ideas of nationalism and therefore looking at different things and working in different ways. This difficulty in talking about important thing sis compounded by the public diplomacy that went on under the different governments, especially when Wilson and Cameron allowed their cabinets to disagree with their politics publicly. This issue is what I suggested has lead to all the major problems for Theresa May. High level politicians are now almost expected to disagree with their Prime Minister and will face no backlash. 

This is all complicated further by politicians repeated and powerful appeals to the public to be final arbiters of policy and legislation, which has in effect created the need for a House of the People, which perhaps just has the political power now but needs a space for this to be exercised effectively. 

The actual dissertation was a bit crap because it was a distance learning course, and I'm working full time in China as a teacher. I really needed to do another draft to make it a bit tighter, but I didn't have the time. I actually thought about doing an IAMA on Reddit, but didn't have enough time.

Most people I've seen online (e.g. content producers) who voluntarily identify under the label ""alt-right"" just aren't (neo)-fascists. Fascism is too narrow a political subset of authoritarian nationalism, the American alt-right people typically want a return to the European favoured immigration policies of the US pre-1965 (or no immigration at all) and a return to the demographic (or sometimes even cultural) profile of that time also.

How that latter point is addressed is where debate exists within that community, also as to why that is seen as a good thing. People advocate ""white nationalism"" by politically diverse and frequently incongruent arguments. It's not different to the fact that people argue for racial diversity from different and sometimes incompatible angles. Moreover fascism is even less appropriate as there is not inconsiderable overlap between libertarians and the alt-right because many advocate strongly for freedom of association and minimal government control over private interactions (e.g. remove laws that stop racial discrimination in hiring or service practices so I can create a voluntary racially homogeneous community). See Hoppe.

Alt-right is a super loose label, neo-fascism is too precise and misses the granularity of things. Even ""white nationalist"" isn't quite right because it's more ""ethno-nationalist"" i.e. a broader belief that ethnic groups are best served in homogeneous societies, not just one specific ethnic group.

I follow this stuff out of morbid curiosity, it seems to me that the ""alt-right"" is highly mischaracterised in the mainstream and it ends up serving them because it lends credence to the argument that mainstream outlets and ""moderates"" are untrustworthy.

I suspect that ""white supremacy"" only really exists in two communities. The 4channers and the common brown people.

The former, mostly as a coping mechanism for the fucked up nature of their societies and governments \(they *are* losing their countries and have no actual control over policy as it is in the hands of the venal professional class and politicians\).

They're not significant to anyone really, but they prove useful to The Left, to scare up and stoke resentment in the hearts of venal and entitled browns \(and blacks\) in Europe, to then ride that for their own political/emotional ends.

The other group that actively ""generates"" white supremacy is the middle class Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani, who uses relative fairness as a status symbol and takes his own frustrations out on the darker desis.

Pretty much all the records that we have now have been passed down (copied from one piece of paper to another) throughout the past couple of millennia, so copies existed in the 16th century. And a lot of the classical archaeological sites are above ground and have been since they were built, so they knew those buildings were there and more-or-less what they represented. I don't think there was much in the way of serious academic archaeology going on until around the 18th century, though. They would have known how long ago the classical era was and the dates of many major figures and events, not because of radiometric dating but simply through written chronological records that had been maintained the entire time.

For that matter, the term 'Renaissance', referring to the new economic, intellectual and cultural advances around the 15th and 16th centuries after the end of the medieval era, literally means 'rebirth' and was chosen because the people of that time believed that classical roman times were the greatest era of history and that the new developments represented the birth of a second 'greatest era'. They deliberately patterned their new art, architecture and academic institutions after those of classical Rome with the idea that these represented the most cultured and civilized ways of doing things. (Amusingly, the popularity of bare white stone sculpture, such as [Michelangelo's David,](https://www.michelangelo.org/images/artworks/david.jpg) around this time was meant to be based on similar sculptures left over from the classical greeks and romans, but archaeologists determined later that the classical sculptures had actually been brightly painted when they were new, and the paint had washed off over the centuries.)

People of the 16th century would have known a great deal less about earlier civilizations, such as the ancient egyptians and sumerians, because written records from that far back were a lot more scarce and harder to translate accurately.

Around 2010, Americans and Europeans ate between 10% to 25% more calories than the coastal Chinese, and about 50% to 60% more protein.

So that's about 250 to 800 more calories, with an average of about 500 or 600 more calories, weighing by population.

Chinese food is deceptively high in calories, and deceptively low in proteins. 

But again, this is coastal Chinese. These measurements don't account for the inland Chinese. 

What really matters though, is being born to a wellfed mother. The Chinese still have another generation of rapid height growth.

Most races will have both a Democrat and Republican candidate and may have various 3rd party or ""independent"" candidates. 3rd parties are like the Libertarians, Greens, Constitutional party, etc and are almost always irrelevant but can decide a super close election by stealing votes from the main parties. However many areas of the US are strongly pro-Democratic or pro-Republican so the weaker party may not even try to compete for local seats like state legislature or city council. 

Here in Seattle, Republicans don't even bother running aside from random people who get basically no votes. Almost every race ends up being Dem vs Dem in the general election. The same is true for Republicans in more conservative/rural parts of the state.

American political parties are super diverse and are very different that European parties.

&gt; Morbid Angel is a death metal band assembled in Tampa, Florida, United States in 1983. They, along with bands like Death, Obituary and Deicide, were crucial in the development of the death metal genre and its standards. Since the band's formation, the band's leader has been guitarist Trey Azagthoth. The band released their first four albums with David Vincent on vocals/bass and Pete Sandoval on drums, before Vincent was replaced by Steve Tucker for the three following albums. Vincent briefly returned for their eighth album in 2011, but was again replaced by Tucker in 2015, with Pete Sandoval being later replaced by Scott Fuller on drums after leaving the band in 2013. The band released their ninth full-length album ""Kingdoms Disdained"" on December 1, 2017.

&gt; Morbid Angel made their vinyl debut in 1987 on New Renaissance Records. Morbid Angel was one of the original death metal bands signed to Earache Records, and was also influential in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots to its current form by adding guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, incorporating atonality in guitar soloing, and dark, chunky, mid paced rhythms. It was also the first death metal band to have a touch of mainstream success, such as being signed to Giant Records in 1992 and having the music video for the song ""God of Emptiness"" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butthead.

&gt; The original lyrical themes focused mostly on Satanism, paganism and anti-Christian subject matter, but from the second album, Blessed Are the Sick onward, the lyrics slowly moved toward the ancient Sumerian gods, though much of this is a nod to the Simon Necronomicon, which was influenced by Sumerian mythology as well as the author H. P. Lovecraft, as well as a fascination with the Roman Empire, though ""anti-christian"" elements continue to permeate the lyrics. Their albums are notable for being released in alphabetical order (their first album starts with the letter A, the second with B, etc.). Guitarist Trey Azagthoth has said in an interview that it was at first a coincidence with the first albums.

&gt; In 2008 appearance on some of the mid-summer 2008 European festivals was announced as a ""short break from writing and pre-production of their new"". After 3 years Morbid Angel released their expected 8th album Illud Divinum Insanus in June 2011. The album includes industrial and nu-metal elements. Also former Hate Eternal drummer Tim Yeung recorded the drum tracks for this album. The album was not well received by a big part of the fans, who liked the band's older and more purely Death Metal sounding albums. 
But there were also fans who accepted and embraced Illud Divinum Insanus. Read more on Last.fm.

It's unfortunate when someone motivated to seek recognition in a competition with no regard for sportsmanship meets PS2. Exploiting is merely the tip of the iceberg. Aside from abusing easy mode playstyles there's lots of chances to abuse fellow Planetmen when being unable to accept losing[[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Briggs/comments/5rksra/vortx_is_getting_banned_lol/dd825fk/)], and, chances to abuse feedback [[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/85cmsx/thank_you_udbdrew_for_what_you_have_done_to/)] on reddit to move the game towards easy mode recognition[[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/7jx5up/vs_briggs_player_skechi_sinking_modules_under/dra6yg3/)]. Bad sportsmanship in pursuit of recognition also led to deleting posts on reddit when things went badly [[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/57vbe5/new_tr_mapglitching_exploiters_and_how_they_say/d8wfv5k/)].

I’m the security you just mentioned.

Security on ships is based on the charter and the cruise line.

The contracts I work have three different tiers-

Me, the contract worker.  I’m a safety/enforcement officer who can manhandle the fuck out of you if you get out of line.  I have no detention authority but I can put your ass on the ground however roughly or gently I decide to.  I answer to the charter but not the cruise line.

Actual maritime cops.  I’m not sure about the legalities.  We call them “white shirts,” they are American (like me) and they have arrest powers.  They can detain you and you will face charges upon returning to the states.  I had an intense argument with someone over how that can’t be true working my first contract.  It’s true.  I’ve seen them arrest folks for drug possession usually, but battery is common as well.

Ship security.  When you sign your contract when purchasing tickets for a cruise, there is a clause in it that says the cruise may take “any steps necessary” to enforce policy while underway.  Guess what?  They mean it.  Ship security are not American and will spirit your ass away to ship jail in a fucking heart beat.  How you get treated will largely depend on your conduct toward them and the nationality of the general customer population.  They typically treat Americans and most Europeans with kid gloves.  Others...  

What “ship jail” entails is based on the ship and the cruise line.  IME they will dump your ass at the next port on the route and you have to figure out your own way home.  If you’re not so lucky they turn you over to port authorities and you answer to whatever legal system is in place in that nation.

Don’t do stupid shit on a cruise.  There’s cameras everywhere.  We saw you do it.  We have it on tape.  Especially theft.  It’s a 10x10 room with nowhere to hide shit.  And we saw you do it.

A privilege, it's worth noting, that has allowed me to earn a very comfortable living with no college education as I watch the rest of my generation drown in student loan debt while making barely above minimum wage in their chosen field.

I know the hate that people who look, talk, and dress like me hold for anyone who is different. I work with them, and exclusively them. A constant stream of bile flows from their ignorant mouths, day after day. I know these attitudes pose real danger; just the thought of the damage they could do to my life and livelihood is enough to keep my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth.

It is all I can do just to muster the strength to say, ""Sorry, but I just disagree."" And I know my career has suffered even for that.

As far as what I understand of GDPR, as long as you're doing ads through Admob, you must have their consent. 

So if you wish to use Rewarded Video Ads, you'll require their consent no matter what. 

What this calls for is a more custom dialog from you, since you can't offer the more common approach of ""Ads"" or ""Ad\-free"". 

So you must write up a new Consent Form that deals with your particular issue. 

How dependent on Rewarded Video Ads is your app? If it's an integral part of your app and they can't use the app without it, then you can explain this in your Consent Form. Tell the EU user that to use this app, they would have to grant consent because of how fundamental this is to the app. Make sure to include the privacy policies from the Ad Providers and your own app so they know clearly what's happening with the data they consent for. So this becomes a ""Grant or Uninstall"" form, which you can't avoid due to how your app depends on Rewarded Video Ads. 

But if your app doesn't depend on these ads that much and it's simply you wishing for it to exist... then I'm afraid you'll have to make a sacrifice of losing out on a user or losing out on some ad revenue. Consent must be granted before you can show them, so if they don't grant consent, you simply can't show rewarded video ads.

German Blitzkrieg depended on breaking through weak positions in enemy lines, quickly moving with motorized armor to encircle enemy divisions, and then, having cut off the enemy, work to destroy it with superior firepower. Even with the Luftwaffe, the Germans did not have superior firepower against the heavy guns of the Maginot Line encased in thick layers of concrete specifically to protect it from German artillery fire, and breaking through the weaker sections of the line would have meant a grisly affair with many thousands of German dead and still much more of the line to deal with, being difficult to conquer even when flanked.

The Maginot Line was a very impressive fortification in its day, the Germans knew attacking it was tantamount to suicide and the British/French knew the Germans were much more likely to attack through Belgium.

&gt; DUBLIN - Britain must submit written proposals on how it plans to keep a frictionless border on the island of Ireland after Brexit in the next two weeks or face an uncertain summer of talks, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was quoted as saying on Saturday.

&gt; The border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland will be Britain&amp;#039;s only land frontier with the EU after it leaves the bloc.

&gt; Under the EU proposal, if all other attempts to avoid a hard border fail, Northern Ireland would form a &amp;quot;Common regulatory area&amp;quot; with the bloc, in effect keeping the British province in a customs union with the EU. Britain has rejected this as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK and on Friday a government official said it was considering a proposal giving Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it can trade freely with both.

Holocaust denial, the denial of the systematic genocidal killing of 6 million Jews and people of various ethnic groups in Europe by Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, is illegal in 16 European countries and Israel. Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize genocide denial. Of the countries that ban Holocaust denial, some, such as Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Romania, were among the perpetrators of the Holocaust, and many of these also ban other elements associated with Nazism, such as the expression of Nazi symbols.

In several nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States, laws against Holocaust denial have come up in legal discussion and have been proposed, but the measures have been rejected.

Yes, that is a limitation on freedom. You seem to have missed the part where I said you are not free if you live under rule of a state. 

&gt;If you have a serious health problem, you may not be able to get treatment, or you will be in debt for the rest of your life.

That isn't a matter of freedoms. That's a side effect of capitalism running rampant. 


&gt;People in most parts of Europe can get abortions and need not fear bankruptcy from health problems. If you set these things against hate-speech laws, you find that the USA has a net negative on freedom.

If those were the only three things that define what makes a person free you'd be right, but it's not, as you admit yourself.

I'm not sure why you're acting as if I think America is the most free place in the world. It's not. It's a state and all states are inherently non-free. Not having to worry about what I say is a very nice freedom to have however, one which many Europeans lack.

Ca se passait dans un grand club med dans le sud. 

Déjà, je ne connaissais pas les clubs meds, j'étais choqué de voir à quel point c'est comme dans les films (Bronzés ...), l'enthousiasme forcé des organisateurs, le côté un peu beauf malgré un prix élevé, le côté grand mélange de populations, entre les couples de vieux, les familles, les jeunes célibataires (et au milieu, 300 consultants en furie, sachant que quand on est partis le vendredi, on a croisé une autre boite qui venait aussi pour un séminaire). 

J'irai jamais dans un centre de vacances comme ça pour mes vacances perso, mais pour un séminaire c'est top, et au final je dois avouer que ça a un certain charme, et le fait que tout soit à disposition (salles de conférences / restau / salle de sport / piscines / bar / boîte) élimine tout stress. Je craignais le truc ultra corporate, au final ça l'a plutôt éliminé.

Autre truc cool, les formations qu'on a eu étaient top. Je redoutais les trucs un peu bullshit, notamment pour la partie management. Au final le formateur pour mon groupe est un comédien professionnel, la formation était top, super concrète, j'ai appris pas mal de trucs.

Dernier truc cool : il y a une réorganisation des années grades par les RH, et par le jeu des chaises musicales, au lieu de passer Senior ""1"" je passe Senior ""2"", ce qui signifie que plus de responsabilités, moins d'années avant de passer manager, un sentiment de reconnaissance, et une augment qui sera normalement plus élevée.

False,oreocereus,,,[],,,,text,"Is Ireland quite windy? If not then you just need to look for something with a proper material. Most materials will be fine, I like cuben for wet because I find the stretch and sag with Silnylon a pain, but it can be worked with. Silpoly might be a compromise between the two is something cuben is too much. 
Look for for a shelter with a proper waterproof floor. Many floors are 95% fine, but if you’re going to potentially wake up on really wet ground, the pressure from elbows, knees etc can overwhelm the the hydrostatic head (ie water pressure rating) and force some water through the floor. This *should* be mitigated by proper site selection, but I’m imagining a worst case scenario. You won’t get any significant water through most floors, but it can increase unpleastantness. 

Design wise, ventilation will be important. If you’re in 100% humidity you’re going to be damp regardless, but anything you can do to mitigate that..
A good bathtub floor design could be important. Again, good site selection should mitigate this, but..
Finally in rainy conditions I find internal space more important. You spend more time inside, and brushing up against a damp fly when trying to change your clothes sucks. So, are you looking at a 2p tent for yourself, or yourself and a hiking partner?

My initial suggestions based on this (please note these aren’t tents I have used or have even researched extensively as they’re not my conditions)
duplex (cuben, good venting I believe, potentially the bathtub is a bit flawed if you want to drop the fly low to the ground, not the best design for more extreme wind, fairly good internal space)
YMG Swiftline (similar to the duplex, better wind-proofness, I think the offset poles give better internal volume, cheaper, and more little details that improve life - heavier)
TT Saddle or stratospire (again similar in style to the other listed tents, heavier). 
These three are in the same kind of territory imo, I would research them first. 

Other options would be a tarp (best ventilation) with generous coverage and a bathtub floor (Trekkertent and ookworks sell them in Europe) for lightest weight, or inner net/bivvy if you need bug protection. This’ll be cheapest and most modular. More faff but it can be fun faff.
A mid tarp (if it’s for 2 people the duomod is a squeeze - upsize) or a trailstar provide very good coverage and modularity as well. 

Finally Trekkertent is a Scottish tent company. They make shit for high wind and rain. Check them out. Liveability isn’t an emphasis of the Stealth imo, but in terms of protection it’s hard to beat. 

If you’re looking for 2p, look for options that are considered roomy, or even some 3p designs if you’re anticipating a lot of time in the shelter.

The agreement makes reference to the UK and Ireland being *""partners in the European Union""*; that partnership and shared EU law is foundational to the agreement, it's why it doesn't need to deal with the border.

Strand two of the agreement include shared all Ireland institutions which are implemented on the basis of shared EU membership and laws, and the constitutional arrangements laid out in the agreement are described as *""interlocking and interdependent""* - break one, break all.

Edit: The 1923 agreement was between the Irish Free State and the UK, it was permanently suspended in 1939. A new agreement followed in 1952, but the Irish changed their laws rendering the agreement moot until 1999, the present agreement was established in 2011. 

Finally, if we leave the EU the southern Irish border becomes an external EU border, and what happens on the EU side of the border is not in the control of the United Kingdom; hence the need for an agreement

False,Dioxid3,,,[],,,,text,"~~Commenting to expand on this later on.~~I have studied earlier civilizations, and there are some pretty controversial statements. Sumerians were the first ones to use math, and their basic unit (? Not native english so please correct me if i use wrong terms) was 60. This works for smaller numbers, but becomes quite troublesome on bigger.

They claim the numeric system we use today with 10 was invented in Middle-East or the Indus-valley, but Egyptians used not long after Sumerians the 10 aswell.

Fingers have little to do with the usage, like someone stated here.

Alright! I was at work so couldn't give a comprehensive answer.

As I already stated, Sumerians were one of the first to bring math to use. It developed quickly after they figured out how to take notes (aka writing was born). Sumerians based their maths on a sexegesimal, or 60. The idea was presumably that you could count physically using twelve knuckles in your one hand, the five fingers on the other hand. Keep in mind, their use for math was keeping up with taxes, so perhaps they wanted one hand free for most of the time. They had developed adding, multiplication and division, even geometrics. Babylonians* later on had tablets about fractions or solving cubic equations. Hell, they estimated Pi to be 3.125. Not bad, taking into account this happened so long time ago. Like /u/barbalaza83 stated in his comment, what's left of the base 60 is our use of 12 for months, and the whole 60 s/m/h based system.

Egyptians had the earliest base 10 numeration system that was properly developed. Their issue was how they used numbers. As an example, a hieroglyph for 1000 took only 1 symbol, but to write 999 it took 27 symbols. The larger the numbers grew, the more tedious it got.

Fast forwarding few centuries, Alexandria was born. It's thought that Alexander III of Macedonia founded it, but there's some discussion about there being people long before Alexander.** THIS, is where it gets interesting. Alexander wanted it to be a center of intellect and culture. It was frequently visited by Greek and Jewish scholars. It would be the most logical explanation, that Egyptian maths were already passed on and around by traders before Alexander, but studying maths were now embraced. Egyptians didn't shun any scholars away like many other nations did, and as stated before, knowledge spread through these scholars to middle/eastern-Europe, like Armenia, Greece, Hebrew and Roman.







*For the sake of clarity, Mesopotamias biggest civilizations were 1)Sumerians 2)Akkadians (slightly disputed) 3)Babylonians 4)Assyrians. When one came to power it pushed the older one away. Hence sometimes inventions even Sumerians figured out are credited(wrongly) to Babylonians, because they are more or less from the same area.

Don’t forget how awesome Arcane is and how it’s literally a build that lets you do everything, like Mundane should have been.

Dark Souls 3s faults come from being a sequel and having a pissy community, not from being a child of BB, that’s where it’s strength comes from, as because of that it feels smooth and fluid, and the DLC weapons are closer to trick weapons than souls ones.

I don’t think Dark Souls 1 or 2 are bad, just that 1 is dated and 2 was a bit of a failed experiment with how wildly it tried to change everything, even down to making a brand new engine. Honestly I think DkS2 would have been a lot better received had it tried to be more cohesive lorewise and artwise with the first game, and not falling victim to quantity over quality with bosses and enemy placement. I never disliked it for its combat or movement, and I thought the move sets, while limited were great. I wasn’t a fan because the lore and art were a very generic high fantasy(see: mirror knight for a random example) as opposed to the broadly European with an Eastern flair brand of grimdark that made DkS1 and DkS3 feel unique and enticing.

Feel goes a long way and DkS2 just felt too cartoony and disjointed. Like walking into a tunnel underneath an ocean, taking an elevator, the ending up in some cave with a bunch of pirates? Or taking an elevator into the sky after being in a windmill and ending up on top of a volcano?

As far as I understood the issue, the big thing was to show to other people that what you KNOW to be true is actually true, and you know, not just what you bet a lot of money on. 

I mean, you and me may have othere private opinions, the question is, can we show it? 

I mean, it's no problem according to my way of thinkinking. If they have done the homework, they don't even need to reveal their precious methods, they can just hand back the facts they have and salvage something. 

Thwe problem is that what the people seem to have employed are the american press methods. It is commonly known. We allready knew that. We don't need to show this. 

Thus, in all fairnmess, I as an european can only judge them with how I judge american sensationalism. It looks good, it sounds good too, but unless I hold the evidence in the hand, and the others had a week to test it, I am not going to believe it ""on good authority"". 

The thing is, with todays climate of fake news, I am beginning to understand what my father had said about the times when the soviet state propafganda reported this, but the house propaganda of the americans reported that. 

""In situations like that, lean back out. Radically. Don't take any side, and treat the issue as if it didn't happen, at all. There will allways be assholes that want you to believe, not because of them showing you good evidence, but because of them saying that you should believe. If they want you to believe, true and good journalists never have a problem showing their work, and making you take the same steps you took. That is what a journalist is. If it acts like a journalist, and hides the evidence, and demands you believe it based on no evidence at all, it's not journalism it's propaganda. ""

And if the office of puiblication is their secret service, and they need to gather publicity, well, I don't have a lot of practice taking what any secret service wants me to believe for full.

False,gallifreyan_pleb,,,[],,,,text,"&gt;Il problema è che, in realtà, per la ""Bubble Democracy""

D'accordo qui, a questo punto credo la distanza tra le nostre posizioni sia solo lessicale: un individuo che sceglie, in maniera cosciente o meno, di ascoltare posizioni solo di una parte, pur avendo accesso a quelle degli altri, non lo definisco vittima di indottrinamento. Il contenuto è simile.

&gt;Da analista politico (e avendoci scritto sopra una tesi), posso garantirti che il sistema politico-istituzionale più instabile è quello che in questo momento abbiamo tra le mani: un sistema parlamentare con una legge elettorale fondamentalmente proporzionale in cui i partiti sono deboli. Tutti gli ingredienti per il disastro ci sono (e paradossalmente, una riforma in senso presidenziale sarebbe particolarmente rischiosa in un momento come quello attuale).

Comincio a capire i motivi delle distanze tra le nostre posizioni: tu stai analizzando la questione dal punto di vista politico, mentre io mi concentro più su quello sociologico/antropologico: i periodi di cui parliamo erano sicuramente più stabili dal punto di vista dell'evoluzione del sistema politico, ma la società con cui parlavano in quel periodo era ben più vicina di oggi al volerli cambiare in maniera distruttiva per me.

&gt; E su questo, purtroppo, non posso essere assolutamente d'accordo. Quella di Macron è una ""Terza Via 2.0"" che ha mirato a raccogliere intorno a sé l'elettorato moderato. 

Capisco ed in parte concordo con l'accostamento di Macron alla Terza Via, ma credo che nel suo approccio ci sia qualcosa che sia propriamente nuovo e che non merita solamente un ""2.0"".  
Nuovamente parlo di qualcosa che ha più a che fare con il sentire della popolazione che con la vera e propria offerta politica, la sua capacità di identificare cosa causi quel sentimento popolare antagonistico alle istituzioni ed ai partiti, e proporre una serie di cambiamenti che affrontino quelle cause, ignorando (in maniera agnostica, direi) se il cambiamento sarebbe descrivibile come di destra o sinistra.  
Concordo sull'assenza di una rete di salvataggio, ma questo è tipico sia del nostro periodo storico individualista e leaderistico, che in generale dei periodi di rottura.

&gt; Su tutto il discorso regionale (che non sto a quotare per comodità) sono d'accordo solo parzialmente. Le politiche Glocal hanno senso fino ad un certo punto, ma è assurdo pensare in un mondo sempre più globalizzato che le risposte principali possano arrivare da dimensioni locali. Si rischierebbe di rincorrere i fantasmi del regionalismo, anziché quelli del nazionalismo in un mondo che va ad una velocità folle.

Temo tu mi abbia frainteso: le soluzioni vanno trovate al livello adatto, non prospetto regioni che impongano sanzioni internazionali, siedano ai banchi ONU o discutano di accordi commerciali: il ridistribuire certi poteri a livello locale servirebbe ad eliminare il deficit democratico che invece si è creato con l'accelerazione dei tempi sociali ed economici a fronte di una staticità di quelli istituzionali: il Centro semplicemente non riesce più a star dietro ai cambiamenti che avvengono localmente, quindi non dovrebbe occuparsene.

&gt; Veramente dal 2009 si è assistito ad un nuovo accentramento dei poteri per far fronte alla crisi. Il problema non è stato tanto quello, quanto il fatto che si sia accentrato a livello intermedio (quello nazionale) e non a quello più elevato (quello europeo).

Nuovamente parlavo a livello sociale: ai tempi del primo dopoguerra tutte le forze civili cercavano qualche nucleo attorno a cui accumularsi per cambiare il sistema politico (con una vera e propria rivoluzione o colpo di stato, come poi in parte fu), mentre durante gli anni di piombo non si cercava di costruire una nuova proposta, ma di distruggere quanto c'era, delegittimandolo (e il rapimento e assassinio del segretario del primo partito italiano riuscì esattamente in questo, distruggendo le speranze di un nuovo periodo di compromesso con il secondo partito, sostanzialmente rendendo le istituzioni incapaci).

What is this got to do with anything? I don't see neither your point nor the relevance of it. I write extensive shit with lots of points, you ignore all of it, say some unrelated shit and say well it is like this just because. Nice reasoning man, keep it up.

First of all host country isn't allowed to add some of its own teams at all. It is all up to the organizer, if ESL doesn't want to add qualifier spot or invite to the IEM for the region then they won't. It is up to TO's, not country.

Also yes, it is so pure common sense that every single competitive sport, game implements a ranking system. Even the professional ones. Here let me quote for you since you seem to lack the knowledge.

&gt;but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games, association football, American football, basketball, Major League Baseball, Scrabble, board games such as Diplomacy and other games.

On some level this is for fair competition and for younger teams it is for to promote competitiveness and improvement. If they let kids like you who think ""You become the best by playing against the best DUH!!"". They would be letting 5 year old newbies play against professional players. The reason the idea seems logical to you is because, in many sports many people like you are just following the top %1. So of course naturally you have a skewed view.

If we come back to CS. According to your logic, the best way to improve for new players is simply play against Global Elites. I wonder why is that so unpopular? I wonder why Valve is cracking down on smurfing so hard? Could it be that they have some fucking hard data about having a steep curve of competition on early stages of the game affecting people's motivation and commitment? I wonder what is your view regarding smurfing?

If you come back to professional scene, you can see how your argument is cracking when you look at how NA couldn't single a major tournament for 6 years and a single BR team came to NA and won a major and dominated the scene in a year. By your logic NA had the chance to play against the best teams in the world for almost 20 years, if you count the old CS scene.

The reason is because, improvement of a region/scene isn't so simple. You need to have many stuff lining up, popularity of the sports in the region, young talent pool backed up by experienced players, social factors and many more shit. People seem to be so misguided about LG/SK's journey to NA and success and everyone seems to think when you move to NA/EU you become a better team automatically. You are ignoring dozens of teams that made this move and failed.

It is not the norm worldwise AT ALL, and is actually a reflection of specific techniques in particular highly industrialised food economies, with low welfare and quality standards. That is to say, this is completely culuturally specific; we don't have to farm like that and most of the world doesn't. 

As some people have mentioned, the vast majority of land in most countries is not suitable for crops, but is for grazing, this is for example true of most of the UK. 

If people in medieval times could have grown crops on all the land they would have, instead pasture develops because it turns an inedible resource (grass) into food. I get frustrated with all of these studeis as reported in the media, because they seem to show nill understanding of agriculture, which is intensely dependent on fertilisers, and is a very sophisticated science.

Animals traditionally fertilised fields with their manure, thinking deeply about the soil lead to techniques like crop rotation which massively increased yields in Europe and population as a result. Many historians think this helps explain why Europe industrialised first and built their empires. 

I used to work as research scientist, adn I remember sitting on a lecture once where a scientist, who was very convincing, gave a talk where he basically said the environmental problems of our age are actually mostly based on transportation, and the associated energy costs. If the future is local, it will not involve the West importing tons of soy or whatever from the third world. 

Either way I would love to hear someone talk intelligently on the subject who is not motivated from the start to say meat is bad. After all, before we lived in the Anthropocene period, the world would have been covered with other mammals, and we would have a balanced ecosystem, right? I have always been suspicious on things which sugget it is not humans but the methane from animals that is unbalancing the ecosystem, even if humans are farming animals to this end.

&gt;**Crime ocorreu no Parque da Cidade, no último fim de semana. Amigos da vítima foram ao local para roubar, segundo investigação; ele não estava envolvido.**  


&gt; O jovem de 16 anos que foi agredido até a morte em uma festa no Parque da Cidade, em Brasília, não teve relação com o roubo de celular que ""motivou"" o linchamento. Vitor Martins Melo foi linchado por cerca de 20 pessoas e morreu no local, no último sábado (26), durante uma festa não autorizada pelo governo. Segundo o delegado Ataliba Neto, responsável pelo caso, o assaltante que estava com Vitor agiu sozinho – pegando o celular na bolsa de uma menina e, em seguida, fugindo em disparada. Nesta sexta (1º), a Polícia Civil cumpriu mandados de busca e apreensão contra nove pessoas, incluindo amigos de Vítor e da jovem que teve o celular roubado. Após o linchamento, os autores das agressões também roubaram roupas, celulares e documentos de Vitor, que foi deixado apenas de cueca no local do crime. Durante as investigações, a polícia descobriu que Vítor e a menina que teve o celular roubado estudavam na mesma escola, e frequentavam pelo menos uma aula juntos. Responsável pela gestão do Parque da Cidade, a Secretaria de Esporte, Turismo e Lazer do DF confirmou ao G1 e à TV Globo que o evento não tinha autorização.

False,AlviseFalier,,europe,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Communal Italy'}]",,Communal Italy,,richtext,"I suppose both postwar necessity and prewar intellectuals all influenced the ideas which would lead to European integration, culminating in the European Union. The search for strength in unity is certainly the simplest way to characterize the general Europeanist feeling dominant in the high offices of Western European governments in the aftermath of the Second World Wa. But it's also true that the intellectual roots of European Unity predate the Cold War. Nationalistic fascism of wartime Europe had spawned an intellectual opposition which instead favored the elimination of national borders in favor of some sort of a unified European federation. As the leaders of this opposition emerged from exile and incarceration and found themselves in charge of postwar reconstruction, the economic necessity of coordinated European reconstruction process was easily integrated with the political desire for lasting European unity. Consequentially, European Integration was fueled not only by the search for prosperity, but also by an aversion to authoritarian oppression. The forces behind European integration, then, appear as a series of juxtapositions: prewar ideas penned by antifascist idealists were adopted by postwar anticommunist pragmatists who resolved to compromise national sovereignty to maintain national relevance.

The seeds of European integration had already been sown by Europe’s antifascist intelligentsia immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. As early as 1931 the French Foreign Minister Arstide Briand proposed a Pan-European federation, right as the German Nazi party was getting ready to win a plurality in the following year’s elections. In 1936 the socialist English writer Henry Noel Brailsford proposed a league which bore a strong resemblance to the structure eventually adopted by one of the predecessor institutions of the European Union, the European Coal and Steel community. After the rapid fall of France following the outbreak of the Second World War, Great Britain emerged as the primary pluralistic antifascist force in Europe, and consequentially the most fertile intellectual environment for ideas regarding a Pan-European federation to ferment. Proponents tended to emerge from the leftist camp, and included socialist London School of Economics professor Harold Laski, influential Fabian Society member and Oxford lecturer George Cole, as well as Times writer and former diplomat Edward Hallett Carr. These proposals did not go unnoticed by the opponents of fascism on the continent, and in 1941 an influential Europeanist manifesto was penned by Altiero Spinelli, an Italian communist organizer interned on the Island of Ventotene, with the collaboration of fellow exile Ernesto Rossi, a socio-liberal newspaper editor.

By August 1943, Spinelli and Rossi’s ideas had inspired the first European federalist organization: the Italian “Movimento Federalista Europeo,” (M.F.E.) which counted among its members many prominent activists of the “Partito d’Azione,” Italy’s largest group opposing the ruling Fascist party. Following the war, the presence of a Europeanist Party in every Western European country as early as 1946 attests to the desire to break with fascism’s ultra-nationalism, an understandable feeling since the consequences of nationalistic extremism were all too clear. Indeed, just like advocacy for Pan-Europeanism united both the communist Spinelli and the liberal Rossi, so did European integration find wide consensus among the two principal forces in postwar European politics: the progressive Socialists and Social Democrats and the conservative Christian Democrats.

By 1947, the argument for a united Europe was further strengthened by the evident need of an economic policy that went beyond the scope of what the individual European states could achieve on their own. Indeed, in September of that year, under the strain of reconstruction, of the newly-constituted welfare system, and of its postwar military obligations, the British government found itself with no choice but to suspend the pound sterling’s convertibility to the U.S. Dollar, effectively going into default. With nearly all of Europe suffering from a deep balance of payments deficit with regards to the United States, the American State Department came to believe that Europe was on the brink of economic collapse, or worse — communist revolution. By the following year the United States Congress undertook to accelerate European reconstruction through the famous Marshall Plan, which I happen to have written about a few days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8n2o8z/cold_war_marshall_aid/dzskv5b/). 

Understandably, economic unrest was quickly fermenting political unrest: traditionally poor Franco-German relations showed no sign of improving post-war, as the French government was bent on tightly controlling its occupation zones in Germany in order to obtain coal, particularly from the Saar region. In light of Europe’s economic and political tensions 1947 was a pivotal year for the movement in favor of European unity. Although relegated to Leader of the Opposition, following the election in the summer of 1945, Winston Churchill — perhaps to further diminish Labourist Prime Minister Clement Atlee’s scant successes in foreign policy — picked up the mantle of the champion of European integration, pushing British conservatives behind a concept that had previously been mostly in the purview of the left. In 1946 Churchill had already come out in favor of a “United States of Europe” at a talk in Geneva, while in 1947 at Albert Hall a meeting of the nascent “United Europe Movement” was held, with the participation of politicians, academics, and even clergymen (indeed, the meeting was presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury).

By December of that same year, a meeting in The Hague appropriately dubbed the “Congress of Europe” brought together 1,200 representatives of the free nations of Europe who supported European integration (including several present and past heads of government). An agreement was struck to form a political and economic union, presided by a common European assembly. This union would work towards gradually abolishing restrictions on trade, coordinate economic planning, regulate the convertibility of currencies, provide for the free transfer of capital and labor, and even lay the groundwork to include Germany, at the time still under occupation. Proving that the currents supporting European federalism were still very much coupled with anti-totalitarianism, the union was also given the prerogative to foster cultural exchange, as well as establish a commission on human rights.

To this effect, the Brussels Treaty was signed in March of 1948. American authorities were enthusiastic about the prospects of a European Federation: in addition to an unrelenting faith in American-style federal democracy, a united Europe would be an additional bulwark against soviet aggression should Russian tanks cross the inner German border. In the American mind’s eye, Great Britain was to take a leadership position within this European Federation. However, the British were far more preoccupied with keeping their own empire together and had a different conception of what a united Europe would look like. Although the British Government was initially enthusiastic about a military and political union, there was a disinterest — if not outright aversion — with regards to establishing any sort of supranational authority, as well as a reluctance to jeopardize English industry by opening up economically.

But arguments on the structure of the union did not jeopardize the notion that a European Union was necessary. The consequences of being overly reliant on the United States were all but clear; Marshall plan money had come at the cost of submitting portions of economic policy to the intergovernmental Organization for European Economic Cooperation (O.E.E.C.), which was itself monitored by the European Cooperation Agency (E.C.A.), an agency mostly staffed by prominent American businessmen (incidentally, this agency was also given the second goal of promoting European unity, again revealing American enthusiasm for a united Europe).

Tellingly, in August of 1949 the Council of Europe and the European Assembly (established by the treaty of St. James Palace in the spring of that same year) opened to great acclaim and enthusiasm for Pan-Europeanism. The institution was less than perfect, and its participants were well aware of it; the Council of Europe was more a forum for debate than anything, since it lacked the authority to pass binding resolutions, while the Assembly only had the power to submit proposals to the Council. However, from there the European unity would only gain steam.

The Spanish Kings and Queens, the entire Nobility and power structure, was as wedded to Catholic Faith beliefs as any in history, and the Church, in Spain in particular, was in a proselytizing, by extreme force, period in the Church's history. In many cases explicitly, convert or die. They destroyed the Mayan, Incan, Aztec, and any smaller civilization they came across. 

They enslaved their people to dig gold and any other intrinsically valuable stuff and ship it across the ocean. But they also actively smashed as much of their culture, their language and such, as possible. The last I heard we could only translate on average twenty percent of the Mayan, Incan, and Aztec languages, it may be up to thirty percent by now, but it is slow going, the Spanish actively, by bringing vast quantities of priests to motivate soldiers through religious fervor, were engaged in the destruction of so many tablets and inscriptions, there is so little left. 

Some of the South and Central American peoples worshiped the Spanish, but most fought actively against it. It made no difference, not just firepower, but diseases the Spanish and Portuguese brought were as, more, destructive than guns. The Portuguese, were in the same position as the Spanish until coming under Spanish rule in 1580-1583. This is why Brazil as a whole, largely, speaks Portuguese today. But the intentional ruination of the Ancient cultures, the enslavement of their peoples, within South and Central Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is key as to why we have so little useful information about, well, nearly anything to do with how day to day life was, within any of the great civilizations of the Americas.",True,False,0,1527954190,,False,0,dzzwmb9,False,t3_8o0fym,True,t3_8o0fym,/r/history/comments/8o0fym/why_is_there_little_information_about_individual/dzzwmb9/,,1532120072,markdown,2,False,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,public,

**Echelon International** \[IIIE\] is a collection of like-minded individuals who are looking for a streamlined, tightly knit community of experienced players, hosts, and veterans who participate in authentic and immersive operations in a variety of settings.

### About Us:

* **Flexibility**: Echelon has no formal sign-up process, no commitments, and offers instruction on request. Certification in specialty roles is available and run by professionals in the field.

* **Activity**: We host operations 7 days a week. We plan and conduct in at least a few operations a day taking place throughout the day during EU and NA time zones.

* **Professionalism**: Operations are cooperative Zeus curated events, built by military veterans, and run by dedicated community members. Roleplay is encouraged, tactics are refined, and immersion is achieved.

* **Immersion**: Mods we use on the server are focused on expanding the default feature set and enhancing immersion. Our entire mod collection is found on the Arma 3 Steam Workshop.

* **Persistence**: When not hosting operations, the community server runs a persistent, dedicated monthly Dynamic Campaign which many community members enjoy during the off hours.

### Requirements:

* **Respect**: We are looking to play with respectful, patient members who we can trust and have a laugh with.

* **Community**: We don't want strangers, we ask members to be social and contribute in their own way. Community management roles are on a volunteer basis.

* **Maturity**: Players must be easy going, know when to be serious, and be willing to learn and improve alongside their fellow Operators.

* **Communication**: Members must have a functioning microphone and use it during all operations.

### Join Us:

Mais le devoir pond cet article sans même se questionner sur les valeurs progressives partagées par Maryam Pougetoux.

On ne sait même pas en lisant l'article qu'elle faisait une sortie en faveur d'un meilleur accès à l'université.

Ben oui crisse, elle porte un voile, alors c'est tout ce que les lecteurs péquistes du Devoir ont besoin de savoir, mais elle vit sa vie et combat des causes comme une québécoise, qui a grandi dans le catholicisme au Qc il n'y a pas si longtemps, le ferait. 

Mais bon, mon point de vue sera probablement negavoté, alors je vous laisse sur une vidéo de Guillaume Meurice de France Inter qui reflète exactement ce que je pense de ce faux outrage:

Short of that, it looks remarkably like democrats are taking people with shady pasts and implying a deeper conspiracy. There is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to help Trump win the election—the indictments and guilty pleas have been for unrelated matters.

**Paul Manafort** - indicted for foreign lobbying in Ukraine and Europe and the money laundering and false statements that attended covering that up. All activity long before the campaign and not related to Trump.

**Rick Gates**- essentially the same thing as Manafort, he was involved in the same foreign lobbying scheme and plead guilty to reduced charges of lying to the FBI about said scheme, and defrauding the US by hiding money offshore.

**Michael Flynn** - lying to the FBI about a meeting he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition period. A meeting he was legally able to take and didn’t have to lie about. Later it came out that the FBI agents who interviewed him [did not believed he was lying](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/27/house-report-backs-claim-that-fbi-agents-did-not-think-flynn-lied-despite-guilty-plea.html) based on what he said.


**George Papadopoulos** - plead guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of his meeting with a Maltese academic who allegedly told him.that Russians had Hillary’s emails. Papadopoulos falsely claimed that the contacts started before he joined the Trump campaign. It turned out that they started on March 14, 2016; which was some time after he “learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the campaign” but a week before the campaign’s March 21 announcement that he was a campaign “policy advisor”. There are [serious problems](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/george-papadopoulos-case-needs-closer-look/) with this guilty plea.

**13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies** - charged with conspiracy for running a social media campaign and identity theft for forging documents. There is no connection between this indictment and the Trump campaign at all. Also, this indictment is mostly showmanship as none of these people will ever stand trial. The only company that came forth to defend itself, Concord Management and Consulting, is ripping Mueller’s case to shreds in the initial filings. One of the companies indicted didn’t even exist when Mueller alleges it conspired.

**Richard Pinedo** - A California man pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge in connection with the Russian indictments above. Again this has nothing to do with Trump or the campaign.

**Alex van der Zwaan** - This London lawyer pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Rick Gates and another unnamed person based in Ukraine.  Again, this is related to Gates and Manafort’s foreign lobbying in Ukraine that occurred and concluded long before the 2016 election.

False,MonsenorTickles,,,[],,,,text,"Okay, I'm not going to be nice, but I am going to make an earnest attempt to tell you, so have yourself a sit and lets talk economics.   


Your problem is, you know what all those words mean, but you don't understand how they apply to economics. That's fine, economics is hard. People get doctorates in this field and still debate on what the hell they're saying. The fact is, most people \(as is evident by your rhetorical question\) know more about economics than you.  


The US economy makes a lot of things, but that is not what drives the US economy. For years now, the US economy has shifted to service industries. In fact, the US economy is roughly 80&amp;#37; service. Manufacturing has a bleed\-over at roughly 37&amp;#37;. \(as service and manufacturing are not mutually exclusive\)  Don't get me wrong, that manufacturing is important as it brings in trillions to the US GDP, but the shift away from this wasn't some conspiracy to undermine the US economy, it is \*literally\* the consequence of a strong US economy,   


The US has a trade deficit. No. Shit. The US has the largest economic market share, bar none. The very nature of an economy as big as the United States demands a deficit, because the US needs to sell its shit more than the smaller economies need to buy said shit.  


To use an awkward metaphor: the person who has the most sex with the most partners is going to need to put more energy into finding partners and maintaining their sex life than the smaller sex lives, which might be perfectly content with their stable relationships. If our sex god's goal is to keep sex levels high, they're going to need to invest more in dates and invest more on each dates. For almost evey partner they have, they will run at a deficit, but this is fine because ultimately our sex addicts capital will still grow, and they might even get a regular squeeze if they play it right.   


So yes, the US has had a deficit for 30 years, and the US economy has been growing for those thirty goddamn years.  There have been hiccups \(mostly war, the housing crisis and people's reforged love or voodoo economics\) but things have still grown. Other nations have grown too, but this closing of an economic lead is not a bad thing, especially when you consider that a country like, say, China, can't surpass the US economically, when the US is what has been stimulating their economy. They can only approach an equilibrium.  


\*\*This is the goddamn invisible hand they teach you about in high school economics.\*\*  


Of course, if China had other trade partners than the US, they might be able to surpass the US economy. Fortunately, the US has diversified her portfolio and is also running trade with NAFTA, the EU, and almost every nation in the African and South East Asian Blocs. Yes, there is a materials deficit, and the US is given heavy tariffs, but with all of this, money is still poring into the US.     


All these little deficits add up to capital, and this isn't just over the last thirty years. The entire Cold War was a war for economic influence. It was the ultimate trade war where the US set up loads of deficits, spent trillions on other nations economies and did some horrible things best remembered in a video game series by Activision, but the end result has been growth. The result has been strength. The result has been an economy so obscenely rich that around 80&amp;#37; of its workforce can sustain itself in service industries.   


Say what you will about the decline of American industry. It is sad that these jobs are going away, it is bullshit that jobs that promised security and sustainability in the 70's are no so ancillary that millions are now reaching retirement age with no savings the get them through the modern economy, It is a tragedy that iconic jobs of Americana have gone by the wayside, but that is all a consequence of capitalism. The capital in those jobs has waned and the market has shifted. The lack of protection for workers coupled with technological innovations has created an arms race to undervalue the labor force worldwide \(good thing the US has millions of service jobs to keep people employed eh?\) and a targeted effort to bring back these industries with no actual regard to the business networks that have flourished under these conditions can only cause a negative feedback loop.  


I can only think of one other powerful nation from recent history that has managed itself the way Trump is trying to manage the US economy: The Soviet Union. If you think anything about that nation was strong, I encourage you take a visit to Omsk.

Handing a vote to a third party, is a vote for hard Tory Brexit at this point. This is why Labour supporters (who were majority Remain supporting) are annoyed, and challenging the difficult position of the Labour leadership - who feel electorally constrained by the high number of Leave voting Labour heartland constituencies - because both sides feel they are caught between a rock and a hard place; Labour voters between voting Remain and voting Labour, and Labour leaders between challenging Brexit and the resurgence of the Red-KIP vote.

On balance, I think a principled stand for Remain, on the basis of what would actually be better for those communities that voted Brexit, would average out as the best course of action, especially as it would distance them from the divided Tories, provide a home for Remainers from other parties, and offer everyone an option for stability that could prove appealing, given wider factors like Trump tarrifs, Syrian conflict etc., and also reflect the demographic future, where Brexiteers are dying off and new Remainers are coming of age to vote.

However, I do understand that there is a feeling in the Labour leadership that a soft Brexit is the only way to get a compromise that doesn't leave a festering, malcontented sore of Brexiteers - be they useful idiots or not - and that a Labour government could also use some separation from the EU's restriction on nationalised services and industry to more easily fulfill some of their more direct policy objectives, such as rail re-nationalisation.

And when I said that blacks and Asians shouldn't be included in the guide, I meant that they shouldn't be included in the 6, 7, 8 and 9 categories. I should have clarified that, my bad.

Even your examples are not good. Jeremy is light-skinned, not that light but still much lighter compared to other blacks. I don't find him that attractive but I would say he is attractive to some extent for sure. Tim is a good-looking Chinese guy but he isn't attractive to me since he has Chinese features. I'm sure he slays in China or wherever he lives where other Asians live. Zayn Malik is almost white, he is half-British and half-Pakistani. North Indians and north Pakistanis who look European and are fair-skinned look similar to whites. I didn't include these people because I wanted to keep my comment simple. They are Caucasian too. Tony Mahfud is totally white, looks like he tanned himself but he doesn't look black at all, he is 100% white and looks Turkish to me.

You said it's counter-productive to give extra points which is wrong too. Who decides which features should get extra points and which shouldn't?

According to you, white and black skin are totally equal but a bad jaw and a really defined square jaw are different and the one with the square jaw should get extra points since he is obviously more attractive and I would agree with this one.

This looks hypocritical to me. Skin colour, eyes, jaw, nose, lips, etc. are all physical features. Everyone has the freedom to deduct points if they think a certain physical feature is unattractive. Finding black skin is a huge no-no but when it's something like eyes then it's totally fine, ruin the guy's self-esteem but be honest and don't sugarcoat. I don't think I'm the only to see the hypocrisy here, dude.

I have a place in Europe and in Asia. In Europe I don’t even use a Netduma router. I took it with me for testing purposes once and the closest server gave me 9ms and the furthest 28ms. So really these things have no value there as it hardly makes a difference. If anything I have found out that it plays better on 28ms then it does on 9ms. And to top that off I play from a third location in Scandinavia which I visit for my work and that returns about 50ms to the Frankfurt and Amsterdam servers, and that connection plays godlike (can’t check the actual numbers but dslreports reports 40ms Amsterdam and 50ms Frankfurt, and they should be similar since I believe the servers are connected to the AMS-IX point, at least in Amsterdam)

P2P functionality is simply in the game for remote regions or other places that don’t have connectivity. There is a lot of players from China for example that can’t connect outside of China because all their traffic is filtered through a government data center. They have to use VPNs and other bs. Also in some places they don’t have fixed infrastructure and use 3G/4G phone connections.

When I play from Thailand in P2P games I actually regularly pull host or have host migration issues etc. At first I thought that it would be an advantage pulling host, but actually the host receives a artificial penalty equal to the average ping of the other players. So if you have one of two 1000ms players in your lobby you’re screwed (this happens for real with some Pakistan ISP’s and 4G players etc) and they will basicly lag you out.

* The US has stronger obscenity laws, particularly for things surrounding nudity.  Compare, for example, the US laws to e.g. German laws for things like public nude sunbathing ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_laws_by_country#United_States)).

* The US government can regulate the ""time, place, and manner"" of protest, even if it can't regulate the content.  [Free speech zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech_zone#In_other_countries) seem to be a much more common American phenomenon (vs Europe).  This might be considered more a difference in freedom of assembly vs freedom of speech, though.

* Similarly, the [US polices labor strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action#Legal_prohibitions) more strongly than many other countries, particularly in Europe. In fact, many European countries recognize a ""right to strike"", whereas strikes in the US are sometimes considered unlawful.

I just quickly scrolled through a bit of information about him, and I'm a bit torn over his dealings with the FARC. On one hand, I believe that working to attain peace is noble and admirable, yet I believe that rebels are also dogs who have effectively renounced their dignity as countrymen. I think I'm leaning more towards condemning his peace deal, though I admittedly don't know the full story.

It is a really complicated story and it has split many families (like my own) on whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. Funny enough the people most against the deal from my experience are my family members near the warzone up in their ranches. The ones most for the deal are those safe in the city. I would've thought it would be the other way around. Perhaps my family is just the anomaly, never checked the graphs to confirm.

&gt;Do you think that liberalism is gaining a foothold down there because cultural dominance is assured for the most part? See, I think that a major reason that the far-right is gaining traction across Europe is because European values and culture is being threatened by migrants who wish to uproot their homelands and bring it with them. South America, however, seems fairly concrete in maintaining its cultural hegemony, so perhaps almost a feeling of cultural self-confidence encourages the growth of liberalism?

You hit the nail spot on. Liberalism feeds on strong and safe societies. When people don't have to worry about an invading horde banging on their gate, after a few decades it is easy to get lulled into the sense that the whole world is like that. It is like the saying goes: hard times create hard men, hard men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times. The West has been living on good times since at least the 2nd Battle of Vienna which proved western dominance over the world. What liberals fail to realise is that civilisations have ups and downs. The good times will *always* come to an end. This is why their utopian ideals fail time and time again. It assumes once the good times start rolling it will never cease.

&gt;Of course they were much too Machiavellian to admit it at the time. But when the architects of what is now the European Union set out their vision, they wanted a superstate that smashed down national borders, which removed countries’ own sovereignty and which rode roughshod over democracy.

&gt;Indeed, these founding fathers explicitly wrote the objective of ‘ever closer union’ among the peoples of Europe into the 1957 Treaty of Rome.

&gt;Aware of the huge threat this posed, far-sighted British political leaders at the time, such as Labour’s Clement Attlee and Hugh Gaitskell, warned that national independence was incompatible with what was then called the European Economic Community.

&gt;Another man to realise that if Britain joined, this country would no longer be master of its own destiny and would lose the power to make its laws and control its own borders was the great historian AJP Taylor.

&gt;As the author of books such as The Origins Of The Second World War, he could legitimately claim to have more knowledge than anyone else about European history and of Britain’s relationship with the Continent, and thus he warned as strongly as he could against the UK’s membership.

&gt;Taylor, whose brilliant TV lectures are currently being re-shown on the BBC Parliament channel, stated that the ultimate aim was political union run by an arrogant elite whom he called, with heavy irony, ‘top people’.

&gt;Above all, he said that Britain had been ‘most secure when we kept out of Europe’, adding that ‘meddling with European affairs has brought us nothing but toil and suffering.’ Predictably, our defeatist political Establishment failed to heed his wise words.

&gt;Not long after, in 1972, Edward Heath, the Conservative Prime Minister, set about negotiating Britain’s membership of the Common Market.

&gt;To win voters to his cause, he cynically misled the British people — telling them that this was only a free trade deal and we would not be giving away our national sovereignty.

&gt;He shamefully ignored the fact that it is in the DNA of the Brussels elite to destroy democracy of the kind that Britain has enjoyed for centuries and which it has spread across the world.

&gt;More important to these unelected panjandrums was the desire to yoke France and Germany together in a union so as to prevent a third world war after two terrible conflicts that desolated the European continent in the last century. Admittedly, that was a noble cause but it meant the ruthless creation of a European superstate.

&gt;It is no wonder that other countries rebelled against this challenge to their own sovereignty and sense of nationhood...

Very easily.

If you live in EU, you could've seen the data published by Valve in compliance to GDPR. It contains all the information regarding an account, like IPs connected to the steam account throughout history, but there's definitely more to it. For example, Valve might store hardware snapshots (that is, unique identifiers based on your PC's hardware combinations) to track users and rather precisely identify if that's the same person.

FACEIT in turn, as a _Major_ hosting platform and organiser, is supposed to work closely with Valve to use the available information to do preliminary checks regarding legibility of accounts.

It is possible to avoid such checks to reveal connection with banned accounts for a player with malicious intents, but for most of them hardware + software + IP + OS UIDs will work. This is the way your website of choice tracks you so that you don't have to log in every time you open the page, for example.

The reason the Yuan can't be a reserve currency is because it isn't convertible. 

The reason China can't make the Yuan convertible is because they would have to expose their financial system to the world and lose control of their currency. 

The reason they can't do this is because they are an export-driven economy, the govt needs to control lending (which they do through giving lenders a subsidy through unusually very low rates...although this is changing), and they have way too much debt so exposing their financial system just now would likely lead to huge capital outflows and a crash (this started to happen a couple of years ago).

The offshore RMB market is actually the route to a reserve currency because it allows people who are not within China to hold RMB (this is basically what a reserve currency is). The reason why the offshore RMB market causes trouble is because China's financial system is mostly closed (the parallel is with the offshore dollar market in Europe in the 1960s...at the time, the US was trying to heavily regulate their financial system...offshore dollars made this very difficult) and if you can take your RMB offshore, then you can escape govt control (i.e. escape the low-interest subsidy for banks). Due to the level of control the govt has over the economy, they have been able to control the offshore RMB market too and the market remains very small (because of the interest rate subsidy, the cheapest way to get RMB is usually onshore) but it is a somewhat febrile situation (as said already, it caused the US tremendous problems in the 60s).

It is true that China has taken many steps towards increasing foreign ownership of RMB (i.e. Shanghai connect with HK) but the final step - full RMB convertability - is impossible and will be for a number of years.

The reason why China talks a lot about SDRs is because their central bank hold something like $3tr of USD assets. This means they are taking a ton of risk that the USD holds in value...which isn't a good risk given recent history. They would prefer to hold more of anything else but can't because no-one's financial markets are large enough.

Where who is coming from? Israelis?

They came from all over - some from Western Europe, other Middle Eastern countries... and even some from Africa. But mostly they came from Eastern Europe, and Russia; more Israelis are of Russian Jewish descent than anywhere else.

100 years ago, Jews were a tiny minority in Palestine, and then they came - in droves - driven, most of them, thanks to Zionist political schemes.

And when they reached a critical mass, they went straight to work, driving the native Palestinians out of their homes and lands, creating millions of refugees, and oppressing, marginalizing and corralling those that remained into ever tighter corners of poverty and desperation, including the giant Prison Camp where over a million men, women and children are held under perpetual siege, unable to leave by land, sea or air, with those trying to escape being captured or summarily slaughtered by the Jews who have stolen their lands, livelihoods and lives.

Why shouldn't these Jewish interlopers shoot Palestinian  children and medical workers? The children will only grow up and breed, and the nurses will only help these pests to survive, reproduce, and create even *more* headaches for those poor, helpless Jews.

Yeah, I see the twisted *""logic and reason""* the racist Zionist bastards use to try to justify their unfathomably atrocious attitudes and actions -- but I cannot stomach it.

America started as a feudal society on the verge of capitalism, and has drastically changed since then. Russia was a feudal society for much longer than that, only becoming capitalist when it became the USSR. It was part of Lenin's transitional government, and actually went further than many capitalist countries. They attempted state capitalism straight out of feudalism, letting committees seize control of entire industries with the intent on transitioning into socialism as the shifts stabilized.

There's plenty of debate as to whether top-down state capitalism is the best transition from capitalism to socialism, but it's the one that's had the most lasting impact, since it keeps the nation on even footing with others on a global level. Bottom-up transitions are easier to take out in their infancy, but would likely have larger success if achieved. 

I think we'll likely see a new socialist nation with a major presence on the world stage, but I think it's going to come from Europe or North America and without the state capitalism, instead of from Asia or South America. An African empire following the USSR might not be impossible either, though it'd probably regress in the same way.

As far as Communism goes, yeah, I think we could get there. If a country like America or Germany really committed to socialism, it wouldn't face its traditional obstacles, and could possibly trigger a large enough global shift that this question could have a more concrete answer.

This summer I’ve booked a few nights solo on Inishbofin off Galway. Small island, cliffs, beaches and walking, hopefully lots of peace and quiet. I plan on spending a few days just writing, walking and reading by myself. Can’t wait. Can be reached by ferry from Cleggan in Galway, you can get a bus to Cleggan from Galway City. There are three hotels on the island to stay in. 

Strandhill in Sligo is easily reached by bus from Sligo town. There are several places to stay if you search Airbnb. The beach and dunes there are absolutely gorgeous, plenty of walking and quiet spots. You can hike The Queens Trail up Knocknarea for some amazing views over Sligo and the Atlantic. There are some decent pubs and places to eat, one small local shop to buy food in. 

Dingle, or even Inch in Co Kerry can be reached by bus from Killarney or Tralee. Both are great spots by the sea. Inch has a beautiful beach for long walks, and hills behind. I’ve watched pods of dolphins swim around the bay there from the hills :) There’s one small beach shop, but really you’d probably want to bring supplies with you. No restaurants there. But Dingle nearby has lots of pubs and restaurants. Walking too. It’s not really walkable from Inch to Dingle unless you’re into long walks! Dingle will have more tourists, but there’s a nice atmosphere in the town. 

More inland Killarney is nice, though busy with tourists. The National Park there is stunning, plenty of walks to take there. You can always get a taxi to some of the nearby spots such as Muckross House. For a real treat The Europe hotel can be reached by taxi from Killarney, it’s about 10 minute drive. Expensive, but a beautiful hotel and wonderful spa. 

I’m still exploring, but these are my favorite spots so far. Can’t wait to see what Inishbofin is like. 

Edited to add: Sligo town, Galway City and Killarney can all be reached by train from Dublin.

Spares, I initially had planned on going all the way to the Black Sea, my itinerary changed along the way, and that meant I had taken too much stuff in spares with me. In Western Europe you’re probably less than 50km from a bike shop, and if you’re really stuck you can order online and ship to the campsite within 24/48h. The two things that broke on me were both things I didn’t have with me, and I did a temp fix and managed to get to a shop. 

Spares/tools that were useful; zip ties, tubes, duct tape, chain tool, multi tool. Do not cheap out on those two tools. (I had a crankbrothers bike tool, and a leatherman). Bring lighters and matches, you will need to light fires and stoves, don’t rely on a single one!

I gave up on a canister stove, because I had moment where getting refills was difficult, so I had to carry a few spares, which took up a lot of space, I ended up buying a fuel stove (MSR Whisperlite), and will never go back! A fuel stove needs some practice, so buy one ahead of time and play with it. Learn to disassemble it. Heure expensive, but they’ll last a lifetime. 

Clothes, two sets of decent cycle gear, and one set of relaxing clothes (tracksuit), you can wash at campsites, so keep it simple. 

Shoes, one pair of cycle shoes (you need clips), one pair of trainers/sneakers, and a pair of really cheap flip flops. 

If you’re planning on wild camping, you need at least 5L of water, cooking cleaning and drinking for the night. Just don’t carry it around all day, fill up end of the afternoon. You should normally have at least 1.5L on you at all times, there are plenty of places to fill up. 

Get a good tent, again, I replaced mine halfway through my trip, a lot hassle for trying to save a few bucks. 

Don’t bother with solar panels and stuff like that, either get a dynamo hub, or just 2 decent power banks. Make sure your camera can be charged of usb. Charge them on campsites or wherever you stay a while. I always asked retired people in motor homes on campsites, they always willing to help a “poor cyclist”. 

A decent trailer is a must if you have more gear than you can carry on the trike, it also distributes the weight more evenly. Don’t buy cheap, my first one died after 800km, and I bought a new one en route. 

So yeah, don’t buy cheap shit, it ends up breaking at the wrong times, and you end up with a lot of hassle and extra money spent.

Fundamentalist antisemites support Israel because they hate Jews because they believe in insane antisemitic conspiracy theories, so they want all the Jews in Israel, which is also an important part of their end times prophecies in the Bible. Fundamentalists also hate Muslims because they're uneducated and don't understand the fact that Christianity, Judaism and Islam are all Abrahamic faiths. So they don't care if Israelis kill Muslims to get more land that belonged to the Palestinians for the 2200-ish years prior to Jews becoming the majority in the original Israeli boundaries around 1918, and even that took hundreds of years, spurred on by the antisemitic Spanish expulsion of Safartic Jews near the end of the Inquisition and a campaign by Jewish Zionists in the 19th century to encourage Safartic Jews from Western Europe/Africa and Ashkenazi Jews from Europe to resettle in Israel as a response to the rising antisemitism in European governments (Russia was considered a part of this system back then). And really, they were only able to settle the land because the Ottoman Empire collapsed, leaving a black hole of authority in the region that Britain stepped in to take the reins of.

Russian trolls use the issue to divide fundamentalists and sane people.

Sane people don't think there's any significance to the land, other than the fact that the Allied powers chose it as a place to get rid of all the Ashkenazi Jews in Europe/America, because antisemitism in Europe/America actually *got worse* after World War II because The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Russian propaganda book authored by the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian Secret Police that directly inspired Hitler's antisemitic conspiracy theories in Mein Kampf, made its way across Europe and to America during the war and people are dumb.

Sane people think it's fucked up to murder people that are protesting their land being seized illegally by international law. Sane people think it's a war crime to murder medics treating injured protesters and that Netanyahu should be tried in the IC for his crimes.

False,Stefan-123,,,[],,,,text,"Am I understanding correctly that Australian law requires shops in all countries to register with the Australian authorities if they wish to sell goods to Australian customers? That sounds like a ridiculous law; virtually no shops will think that it is worth the trouble to register in Australia. In other words, it will be virtually impossible for Australians to buy foreign books, foreign music and other foreign stuff.

What happens if a foreign shop doesn't charge Australian tax from the customer? Would a court in Europe, the United States or China or wherever accept the Australian claim and force the shop to send tax money to Australia, or would the Australian government be unable to collect the money, unless the shop has assets in Australia? Would the package be rejected and sent back at the border?

In Europe, the politicians have found a different solution: tax is collected by the shop if you buy from a shop within the European Union. If you buy from a shop outside the European Union, then the tax is paid when the package goes through customs. The tax is usually collected by the shipping company and then the customer has to pay in one way or another. A few shops offer services, such as Amazon's ""AmazonGlobal"", whereby the shipping company bills the sender instead of the recipient. The shipping company also charges an administrative fee which may make it too expensive to buy from abroad, and you have to pay this fee twice if the shop decides to split the order into two separate shipments. Still, this requires no special handling by the shop, so it's easy for foreign shops to offer shipping to Europe. On the other hand, if the shop sells digital content instead of physical goods, then the shop has to register for tax in an EU country, so maybe it's difficult to find foreign shops which sell digital contents to Europeans (if the law is enforceable outside the EU).

Someone compared this to the situation in the United States where there are a lot of different local tax rates. Do shops have to register with the local authorities and fill in hundreds of tax forms and send to the cities and states , or is it enough to register with IRS and fill in standard IRS forms and let the IRS hand over the money to the correct authorities? The latter probably means a lot less administration for the shop.

False,OtterPop925,,,[],,,,text,"My worst boss was a bookkeeper in Seattle. She had severe psychological problems. She is a crazy one, literally! Also a bit paranoid. Let's paint the picture of the work environment \(have a seat. This is a long one. HA!\). Keep in mind she likes to hire people that have no bookkeeping experience so as not to pay them a bookkeeper salary, then expects them to learn new things in one try. 

First off, she ran her business from the house she was renting. When I first started working for her, she had one employee of 3 years. A new employee joined us almost a year later. The boss used one of the bedrooms in the house as her personal office, and the employees worked out of the basement. The employee entrance was through the garage car door, as there was no normal door entrance to the basement, except through the interior of the house which we were not allowed to enter when she was not there. Whenever she would step out \(which was several times a day\), she locked the basement door to the interior of the house and opened it when she got back. The only way in and out of the basement was the electric garage door. The wiring in the house was old, so one side of the basement had to be powered by an extension cord connected to a socket in the basement bathroom. Even then, the fuse would blow if you turned on the portable oil heaters that we had in the basement \(the house interior had central heating\). We had to turn certain things off to use others so as not to blow the fuse box. Once when she stepped out for the entire day, a storm knocked out the power and we were trapped in the basement \(fire hazard?\). We called her and she said that she was not able to come back until later and that we would have to try to open the garage door manually. That was not an easy task to do in a dark basement. 

This boss had a tendency to act or react based on her emotional state at the time of talking to, reading an email from, or receiving a phone call from anyone. She is incredibly crass and disrespectful to her employees and most people. Instead of logically and rationally analyzing a situation before approaching her employees, she would make a quick assumption and angrily lash out without factual justification. The first employee of three years left because of her constant abuse. The young girl would vomit before work just thinking about what reason the boss would yell at her that day. All employees left due to her constant bullying. Only the new guy left on good terms with her, but the funny part is that he would complain and talk about her the most, yet never confront her. He would even talk about her on a personal level, such as her awful home decor and state of her bedroom \(her bedroom door was always open when we would go upstairs to ask her questions\). Anyway, the boss would make changes or take actions without informing us, yet expected us to know, even though we were completely unaware of the email conversations between her and her clients. When she realized something was her mistake, she would not apologize for shouting at or humiliating us in front of the other employees. She is the definition of Workplace Bullying. I was the only one that confronted her about her bullying, and she decided to passive\-aggressively punish me for exercising my right to dignity at work. 

There were two occasions in which she and I had to meet regarding the way she interpreted my emails or actions based on her emotional state at the time. On the first occasion, she was on vacation in Europe and emailed me about something I missed. In this email, she went on a rant about how she has to “put her vacation on hold” and go back to her hotel to file a client's taxes when I’m done with what I had to do. When I did the two\-minute simple fix, I simply replied “done”, as I didn’t know how to respond to her rant about me ruining her vacation. When she came back, she called me into a meeting about my “attitude” in the email response. She was extremely upset and said that she would never respond “done” to a boss, yet she had no problem sending that response to us \(I have responded “done” to many employers, and they never interpreted it the way she did\). We had a conversation regarding her bullying but were unable to reach common ground, so we decided to try and work through it. It only lasted two weeks before she started her bullying behavior again. 

The second occasion was when she came down to yell at me over something she accused me of doing. When it was discovered that it was her mistake, she just said: “but regardless, don’t let that happen!” She basically just came down to yell at me over something she did, then told me not to ever let that happen. I couldn’t help but look away and smile due to the confusing reaction from her. She then called me to her office and we had another conversation about my smirk, calling it a “scoff”. I then explained the way we all feel about her verbal abuse, humiliation, and ability to degrade and belittle us on a daily basis. When she asked, “who is we?” \(knowing that she only had two employees at the time\), I said the other current and the previous employee. She then asked who, to which I just mentioned the only other employee that left so as not to get the current employee in trouble, she then responded with intimidation by saying “I would be very careful about mentioning names”. What?! It made no sense to be asked to mention names followed by intimidation to not mention names. She is fucking crazy! I also mentioned the way she rolls her eyes in disgust when we would come to her for help sometimes. She replied that she never does that. I told her that she’s done it to me twice \(three times after that\). She asked for dates \(most likely to give me some A\-hole response if I didn’t have any specific dates\), and when I gave her one she replied with a serious face saying “I was kidding…”. I said that I don’t understand how she doesn’t realize that she speaks to us in such an awful manner but is very sensitive to the way she assumes others speak to her. Her reply to that comment was, “because I’m the boss”. I have never had a boss treat me with such disrespect the way this particular one has. There is a big difference between a tough or demanding boss that is respectful and fair, and a boss that talks down to, belittles, degrades or humiliates us while refusing to listen to reason the way she has. Shortly after our second meeting about the way she treated us, she decided to behave very passive\-aggressively toward me by drastically cutting my hours without an explanation. She remained nonchalant about it and would nicely just tell me to go home if I have run out of tasks to do. I was suddenly working ½ hour to \(maximum\) 4\-hours per day shifts. I was a full\-time employee.

She also had a tendency to make changes without informing us but expected us to know these changes were made. We were not aware of anything that happened in emails between her and the clients, yet were later informed via a splenetic email from her telling us we “screwed up” for doing something we were unaware we didn’t have to do because we were not aware of the email sent directly to her. This happened a lot! One time I didn’t pull a bank statement for a client because it was not in my to\-do list \(she was very strict about the to\-do tasks she created and assigned to everyone\), so I was unaware that a statement for that specific client needed to be pulled. She asked me why I did not pull the statement, and I told her I did not know because it was not in my task list. She snapped back at me saying that it may not have been on my list but it’s still a task that I normally do on a monthly basis, so I should have been aware. On the other hand, months later I pulled a bank statement for a client and placed it in another coworker’s folder to reconcile. I received a nasty email from the boss the following day asking me why I pulled the statement for this client. I replied that it was one of my monthly tasks. She responded by saying it was not on my to\-do list and therefore I should not have pulled it. I said that I thought she may just have forgotten to add it to my list, as it is one of my monthly tasks. She responded saying it was not on my list because the client no longer had her business. The rest of us were completely unaware of this, as we were never notified that the client no longer had her business, yet, she expected me to know. She replied telling me that because I pulled the statement, “five hours” of work was billed out to the client and now she had to credit them, blaming me for her “loss of money”. It was the next day that I decided to tell her that it was not entirely my fault that five hours of work was lost. Pulling a statement is billed at .25 hours. If there was no task for it to be reconciled, why did the other employee still reconcile it? Since the employee that works remotely is her personal friend, she is not at fault, according to the boss' “logic”. She agreed, but never apologized for blaming me, or yelling at me in front of the other employees.

She is a very controlling person that refuses to listen to reason and takes any constructive criticism as a personal attack. When I mentioned to her that the other employee and I thought that it would be easier on us if we were allowed to pull statements for our own assigned clients instead of me doing it for all clients. She responded by asking me when we spoke about and decided this. I told her “a few days ago”. She got furious and she said that she never wants us to discuss work issues behind her back and that if we have ideas like that again we have to go to her directly instead of discussing between us. How is anyone supposed to agree on an idea before approaching the boss if we are not allowed to discuss them? She seriously needs psychological help.

On one occasion, I mentioned to her that I was thinking about probably taking a trip to Turkey to visit a friend, to which she replied \(in front of coworkers\) “you’re not going to Turkey”. I said that I was thinking about it, and she said “You have to ask me for permission before deciding that and besides, September is the end of the third quarter and I need you here. You can’t go”. It was so humiliating to be told that in front of other employees. The other employees also noticed how terrible that was, and tried to make me feel better afterward. The ironic part is that the boss would take more than a couple vacations a year, even during the end of a quarter. On another occasion, she hired a new employee a few days before going on another vacation. The guy had no idea what he had to do. I understand that she works while on vacation, but you must lead by example instead of controlling people and doing the things you don’t want them to do. 

This is just a small portion of the shit I had to deal with on a daily basis, simply because she had some psychological issues for which \(I assume\) she never sought treatment. There was no organization to the way things were done and no way to tell who did what since everyone does different tasks with all the clients, so she decides who she wants to blame for errors without knowing the cause herself due to not keeping proper track of whom does what, then attacking us before analyzing a situation. She would assigns tasks to me which I have never done, but didn’t mind doing. The problem is that she assumed I’ve done them before and should therefore not have to ask her for help. If I said that I have not done that task before and need help, it would infuriate her. It is unclear how she was treated by her employers in the past, but if she continues to bully her employees based on her emotional state instead of using logic and reason to run her business, she'll only spend more money training new employees due to the turnover rate, and maybe even have to deal with future lawsuits.

False,WatchingDonFail,,california-flag,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'California'}]",,California,,richtext,"&gt; European Council President Donald Tusk (a former Polish prime minister) last week criticized “the capricious assertiveness of the American administration” over issues including Iran, Gaza, trade tariffs and North Korea. adding: “Looking at the latest decisions of Donald Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies? But, frankly speaking, Europe should be grateful by President Trump. Because, thanks to him, we got rid of all the illusions. He has made us realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm.”

&gt; You realize what this means?

&gt; These are significant words, under-reported by the U.S. media that appears to simply assume the continuation of the existing U.S. hegemonic order in the world, is addicted to the cult of promoting military “service” as a good in itself, and—while wanting to bring down Trump for various reasons—cannot challenge capitalism and imperialism or make astute analyses of present conditions because they are paid by corporations that have vested interests in promoting the CNN and NYT concept of reality. The fact is, the post-war U.S.-dominated world is collapsing, as it should. As empires do.

&gt; The fact that this collapse is aided by a colorful idiot in the White House merely adds dramatic appeal to the historical narrative. He will grandiloquently preside over some sort of Korean agreement to satisfy his ego, then perhaps attack Iran with zero European backing but frenzied Israeli and Saudi support, inaugurating a major if not world war. This would not further endear this country to the planet in general. Trump has no idea what he’s doing. He’s surrounded by generals who insist on maintaining U.S. troops in Syria undermining the Syrian state, in Iraq and Afghanistan towing the line, in Yemen aiding the Saudis’ anti-Houthy effort, while a listless Trump tweets about Fake News and the Russia investigation when he’s not boasting about the employment rate under his greatness.The U.S. could sail into a war at any time and Trump will say, “I trust Mattis to handle it. I love my generals!”

Bastiat starts on the most basic level: life. Everyone of us is alive, but life is not self-sustained. To maintain our life, nature/God (whichever one you prefer) has given us 'tools'. Thus, we exist as individuals, and we have faculties (Ability to act, to labour, if you will). At the same time, we are sorrounded by 'elements' (quoting The Law here). To maintain life, we must exercise our faculties on the elements around us, to appropriate and assimilate them.

These three characteristics (existence, faculties, appropriation and assimilation) are intrinsic to, and required to sustain, life, and are inseparable: you need to appropriate elements to stay alive. This requires you to use your faculties, which are derived of your existance as an individual. The right to property is thus demonstrated to be intrinsic to your very existance.

This is my takeaway from the first pages of 'The Law'. It is not a long read, I recommend you check it yourself. I think it's a pretty good (albeit divulgative and at times, propagandistic) introduction to liberal-libertarian thought.

The explanation I gave here is, I believe, explained in more detail by other liberal authors, too (using liberal here in it's classical, european sense).",True,False,0,1527984189,,False,0,e00n6de,False,t3_8l5mbl,True,t1_dzflmd9,/r/Libertarian/comments/8l5mbl/rlatestagecapitalism_posts_a_bastiat_quote/e00n6de/,,1532132924,markdown,1,False,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,public,

Even though I seriously hate how MegillahThriller talks about this subject there are concerns there needs to be a serious discussion about this subject. I as an Ashkenazi Jew in the US have been binned in the oppressor class because just because I have white skin. 

I understand there are historical and ongoing racial issues, to say the least, among  Jews in Israel but this does not translate to Jews outside of Israel. 

I despise how the POC term has been used by non-jews in the US to separate me from non-Ashkenazi Jews and make me out to be their oppressor. Fuck that shit. I want to be connected to every type of Jew. I want to be part of one universal Jewery and at the same time time celebrating our diversity. I am a minority. I deal with hate in the US making me an oppressor doesn't get rid of that.

I am want every Jew to celebrate their own unique ethnicity and form of Judaism. In fact I want to learn about every type of Jew.  I don't want them to be Askanazified. 

I just really hate non-Jews trying to define who we are and trying to put a European - POC dynamic that is not a 1 to 1 comparison at all.

Similar declines are also seen in several of the Commonwealth nations such as Pakistan (down from 39 to 20%), India (43 to 33%), and Canada (80 to 73%). Attitudes in China buck this trend, with favourable opinion of the UK among the Chinese rising markedly, from 39 to 73 per cent.

Firstly, the ""Link tax"" thing is in Article 11 not Article 13 of the proposed directive (a good hint this person doesn't really know what they're talking about). It's also been in the pipeline for at least 5 years.

It doesn't actually add any new rights to anything. What it does is give *publishers* of press articles some of the same rights that authors already have (for 20 years). So if there is a ""link tax"" under this Directive there would be a ""link tax"" already. Nothing would be becoming illegal that is currently legal - under this provision.

The actual Article 13 stuff, on user-uploaded content, is a bit more subtle, and is supposed to work both ways. It states:

&gt; Information society service providers that store and provide to the public access to large amounts of works or other subject-matter uploaded by their users shall, in cooperation with rightholders, take measures to ensure the functioning of agreements concluded with rightholders for the use of their works or other subject-matter or to prevent the availability on their services of works or other subject-matter identified by rightholders through the cooperation with the service providers

Digging through the legalese it is saying that file-sharing hosts should try to work with copyright owners to make sure people aren't uploading stuff to their services they're not allowed to, *but also* to ensure that they have some agreement so that people are allowed to upload stuff.

As with everything the EU does, anything required must be ""appropriate and proportionate"", so it can't force anything absurd on website hosts etc..

The Directive would also require a complaints process for users, to dispute a copyright claim.

Sure, this isn't perfect - and I'm not exactly the biggest fan of the EU's current copyright laws (although they're more permissive than the UK's) - but this proposed directive isn't quite as bad as it is being made out to be.

It certainly isn't ""the end of free speech in Europe"" or ""early 1920' Nazi style totalitarianism.""",True,False,0,1527988463,,False,0,e00qrok,False,t3_8o40np,True,t1_e00ig2f,/r/ukpolitics/comments/8o40np/eu_proposed_internet_regulation_looks_scary_af/e00qrok/,,1532134647,markdown,2,False,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

Region designation doesn't create arbitrary scarcity, it creates arbitrary prestige. There's no scarcity of imported Italian meat. 

Are you saying anybody should be allowed to make ""Prosciutto di Parma""? Should Canadian businesses be allowed to call their Prosciutto ""Prosciutto di Parma""? Note that the name literally means Prosciutto of the town of Parma. If your prosciutto isn't made in Parma, why would it be okay to call your prosciutto ""The prosciutto of Parma?""

It's not simply a descriptor like ""Parmesan"" cheese, or ""Buffalo"" wings. Those terms have colloquially been used to describe a type of product, rather than one specific product. The PDO doesn't prevent you from entering the market. If you're an entrepreneur that wants to make the prosciutto of Parma, then go live in Parma, and make some. The consortium at Parma welcomes new producers that adhere to the production methods and standards that they value.

If you want to create a new Prosciutto that surpasses that of Prosciutto di Parma, then do so. Start from the beginning and start making Prosciutto of Tokyo. But it better be good enough that people can tell yours is superior.

Are you going to try competing with Philedelphians to make the best cheese steaks? Or with buffalonians for the best hot wings? The only difference here is that the prosciutto from Parma has a track record spanning many generations, and the people already accepted it as the superior product prior to lobbying for the PDO.

&gt;""they have elevated official status that will always be regarded as superior to competitors who are not allowed to compete regardless of quality""

In fact, you do see competition among PDO foods. PDO Salame from Cremona competes with PDO Salame from Angelo di Brolo. What's the lesson here? If you want to compete with a product that's been preferred in the region for centuries, then go find a similar product that has been produced in a unique way in a different region that has been preferred there for centuries. Apply for PDO. Compete.

If your product doesn't have a distinctive origin, and you can't say how it's very different from other products on the market, then you haven't earned that distinction.

I never claimed that this model provides the best food, please don't put words in my mouth. Even Wagyu beef which is insanely expensive can't objectively be called the ""best"" beef. You wouldn't eat that for every meal, even if it was on par with the price of regular beef, it's too rich, too fatty.  But what PDO does is protect a culture and maintains quality. It protects the identity of the cultural food item. So that you can't arbitrarily call your beef ""Wagyu"" or say your Prosciutto is from Parma. And it protects the consumer: if you are looking for the experience of the super-marbled Wagyu beef from, you know that's what you're getting and not beef from somewhere else.

PDO is assigned by a committee of the European Union. Not a just a singular country's government, but a committee from many countries has determined that these products are *unique*. Note that they don't say these products are *superior*, just that they're culturally *unique*. Sure, the committee can be bought. But it's the consumers that have decided that these unique products taste superior. If you think they've been bought, then no doubt other companies will buy the same politicians again. But there'll be hell to raise if your ""Swineur"" isn't a strong cultural phenomenon among the people of Swine.

False,PortalOfExistence93,,,[],,,,text,"While the winter of '41 did undeniably have an impact on the German Army and its performance, it's heavily over-exaggerated and ignores many of the other crucial effects that impacted the German Army.

The effects commonly attributed to winter and commonly believed to have beaten Germany are actually much more complex. Around a million German soldiers perished during the winter, however, Germany managed to replace every single one of those losses. As a matter of fact, the German army grew in size throughout the entire war, peaking in 1943. The casualties sustained during the winter were replaceable. The other effect commonly attributed to winter was that it ground the German advance to a halt, giving the Red Army time to recover. What this ignores is the logistical situation of the German Army in November. German logistics could only effectively keep up with the Army for around 300 km. But by November, the Germans were well over 800 km into Russia. This meant that the German frontline troops were so starved of supplies that they couldn't advance, even if it had been in the middle of summer.

Another factor about this was the German fuel crisis. Germany had been running a massive oil deficit since the war started in '39, and had only been able to survive by eating up her oil reserves. By the estimations of Georg Thomas, the head of the War Economy and Armaments Office, Germany only had enough fuel to be able to sustain 2 months of full scale offensive operations against the USSR The war started on the 22nd of June, so, the fuel supplies would last until late September-Early October.

Germany had to capture the Caucasian oil fields before that deadline, or else their oil reserves would be depleted, and the army would be ground to an halt.

So, around the same time that winter started coming, Germany ran out of fuel. This, combined with the overstretched logistics, is the actual reason why the German advance ran out of steam in October-November, not the winter. As a matter of fact, most German units had stopped advancing even before they ordered to dig in for the winter.

The Winter didn’t do any permanent damage to the Wehrmacht or it’s chances of victory. The casualties sustained during the winter could all be replaced, and the inability to advance would had happened even if the weather was perfect.

So, in conclusion, the Russian Winter did have an effect, but it did nothing to the German Army that the Oil Crisis and the logistical situation wasn’t already doing to it.

But, even with all of that being said, it must be pointed out that even if the winter had been devastating, it still wouldn’t had mattered.

Why?

Because of the aforementioned Fuel Crisis.

A lot of people argue that the tide of the war turned at Stalingrad, or maybe even at Kursk. However, I would put forward that Germany’s last chance of victory slipped away in October 1941, when her oil reserves ran out.

The moment the German oil reserves ran out, the Wehrmacht immediately found itself being extremely limited in terms of offensive capabilities. They could no longer launch grand offensives, sweeping over hundreds of kilometers of enemy territory, encircling entire armies, and riding off into the sunset. Instead, they had to spend months rationing to save up fuel for even just a few weeks of limited offensive operations. Luftwaffe pilots had to spend weeks just sitting around on the ground because there was no fuel to run their planes with, tanks had to stop in the middle of a battle and wait several days for fuel.

After the oil reserves ran out in 1941, Germany never again had the ability to launch an offensive large enough to be able to knock the USSR out of the war. Instead, German offensives got smaller and smaller from that point onwards, both in scope and the amount of men involved. Without the fuel to be able to launch grand offensives, Germany stood no real hope of beating the USSR and winning the war.

Some argue against this idea by pointing out that Germany managed to continue the war until 1945 without ever capturing the Caucasian oil fields, but to quote Dr Anand Toprani “Synthetic Fuel allowed Germany to wage war but not to win it. Germany’s economically illiterate Generals scoffed at economic advisers who urged the conquest of the Caucasus by pointing out that Germany “managed to carry on the war until 1945 without ever scouring the Caucasus oil.” But at no point after the failures of 1941/42 did Germany ever possess the opportunity to win the war on favorable terms. Rather, Axis Europe had to spend the rest of the conflict laboring under constant constant shortage of energy, which constrained economic productivity and military effectiveness.”

Anything beyond October 1941, including winter, was a formality. Germany no longer possessed the opportunity to win the war. And without being able to win the war, it was only a matter of time before they lost. The Winter didn’t have a permanent impact on the Wehrmacht, but even if it had had one, it still wouldn't had mattered.

In the present that's not realistic as most of the commercial vehicles are diesel and restrictions would lead to massive economic problems.

If he sees you first, for example, he has 200+server latency extra milliseconds to shoot at you before you will ever receive notification that someone shot at you.

This also applies to when you are holding an angle and he is pushing you - he could have up to 1/5 or 1/4 of a second headstart to shoot you if he peeks knowing where you are. 

The reverse, however, is also true - if you shoot him first, he will most likely not have time to react and die. The thing is, people with high ping know they have high ping and can play accordingly. When I play EU(sometimes my warmup match), as a player who is already pretty good, the extra 100-200 ms I have to shoot before they ever see me is very often enough to completely finish the fight. On their screen, they just die immediately, or put 3 rounds into me and see me take zero or 1 hits in the deathcam. That's where the major advantage comes from - knowing absolutely I can peek others because I have the ping advantage, versus when I'm on my own server I don't know if my enemy is a low ping player(and thus holding the angle is a good bet) or a high ping player(I need to push him and play aggressively to make sure he doesn't get the peek on me)",True,False,0,1528000286,,False,0,e00zz6s,False,t3_8o2j80,False,t1_e005xmb,/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8o2j80/psa_desync_will_be_worse_if_you_have_low_ping/e00zz6s/,,1532139066,markdown,3,False,True,False,PUBATTLEGROUNDS,t5_3fmbm,public,True

Purser, é nada mais nada menos do que recepção do hotel dentro do Navio. Você vai ajudar com o check-in/check-out de 3000 pessoas a cada 7 dias, anteder reclamações, fazer cambio de dinheiro aonde necessário e dar ajuda sobre os ponto turisticos. Muitas empresas fazem rotação dos Pursers para o departamento de excursões, que você vai fazer venda e organização das excusões em terra (99% delas são terceirizadas, entao vc só vende e organiza as pessoas para sair do navio) e também com o ""Crew Office"" que é mais ou menos um departamento de RH dentro do navio, que trabalha com chegada e saida de tripulantes, pagamentos, reclamações, etc. Você irá trabalhar MUITO em quase todos os dias, exceto durante o tempo em que o navio esta em porto (caso nao esteja em excursões). São tratados como Officers ou Petty Officers, explico mais adiante sobre. 

Shopping vc trabalha nas lojinhas do navio, o bom desse trabalho é que durante a estada do navio no porto, 90% das vezes elas estão fechadas, uma vez que é Duty-Free e faz concorrencia com as lojas nos portos. Você trabalha com venda e estocagem/organização das lojas. É um trabalho um tanto mais facil, porém ganha menos. Você irá trabalhar muito em dia de embarque/desembarque CASO tenha sido selecionado para fazer estocagem. São tratados como Staff

Fotografos....sugiro fazer um curso de 1 semana de fotografia ou algo parecido para dar impressão que vc tem algum conhecimento e não moscar. Não precisa ser nenhum profissional da vida, qualquer amador que sabe usar as luzes e cameras ""pros"" consegue o trabalho. É uma vida quase que ardua, mas é tranquila. Você irá trabalhar muito em 3 situações; Embarque/Desembarque em TODOS os portos CASO seja selecionado. Todo dia de manhã os fotografos são os primeiros a descerem no porto para armar um cenário relacionado ao porto e tirar foto das pessoas saindo do navio. Em dias de traje formal, que você irão andar pelo navio e principais centros para tirar foto. Um dia antes do desembarque, que o departamento vende as fotos à preço de banana e faz um ""SALE"". São tratados como Staff.

Existem outros trabalhos, como garçom de restaurante (ganham muito bem), ajudantes de buffet, ajudantes de bar, camareiro/limpeza. Não sugiro, pois são tratados como Crew. 

----------------------------------------

Officer, Staff e Crew; é uma hirerarquia de privilégios a bordo. Officers/Petty Officers são bem privilegiados, recebem cabines para morar mais aconchegantes, muitas vezes dividem apenas com uma outra pessoas, podem andar e frequentar bares/restaurantes de passageiros (com certas restrições), tem maiores responsabilidades em situações de emergencias. Algumas companias oferecem camareiros e lavanderia para roupa pessoal gratuitamente (embora muitos davam gorjeta para os camareiros)

Staff é considerado o meio... normalmente dividem a cabine com uma outra pessoa, mas é uma cabine mais simples. Podem frequentar poucos bares/restaurantes de pasasgeiros, muitas vezes devem fazer solicitação ao chefe do departamento deles. 

Crew é considerado a ""ralé"" (sim, infelizmente são tratados assim), dividem quarto com 1,2 ou 3 pessoas (alguns dividem o quarto com 1 outra pessoa, mas o banheiro é dividido entre 4 total). Não podem frequentar areas de passageiros e tem as menores responsabilidades em situação de emergencia)

---------------------------------------

Contratos são normalmentes feitos de 6 a 8 meses, com possibilidade de extensão, caso você aceite. A compania paga pelo aereo/hotel/comida/traslado até o navio. E após o seu contrato normalmente férias de 1 a 3 meses. Pagamento muitas vezes é feito em CASH a bordo do navio ou em um cartão de débito/cash card. A bordo você não tem NENHUMA despesa, apenas bebida alcoolica ( que é INCRIVELMENTE BARATA ).

Para começar você tem que fazer um processo seletivo básico através de uma empresa brasileiro, como a Infinity ou no caso da Royal Caribbean, direto com a agencia deles em SP. Começam com prova básica de ingles e entrevista de experiencia. Caso passe vão falar para fazer um check-up médico, que é ladainha, pq é claro... Brasil adora molhar a mão da galera. As agencias indicam 1 ou 2 médicos na cidade, que fazem um check-up ultra completo por um valor super caro (em 2008-2010 paguei R$800), mas na verdade só precisa de um check-up simples. Mas não tem como não fazer, pois todas as agencias fazem isso. O médico de SP é um cu****o que tem um escritório na Av. Angélica e adora falar como as filhas foram visitas o Canada/EUA nas férias) - Desculpa o desabafo.

Bem é isso... tive experiencia entre 2008-2012, mas creio que a maioria das coisas se mantem. É uma industria que não faz muitos avanço em termos de mão de obra. Qualquer duvida, estou à disposição.

False,MartialSparse,,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Imperial Longsword'}]",bb05b984-7606-11e2-9541-12313d18803b,Imperial Longsword,dark,richtext,"&gt; Is the two handed sword he writes of 'his' version with the blade the length of a one handed sword, or a really long two handed sword? If the former, why does he not mention the long version; weren't they in use at this time?

This is a query I have as well. Generally, I've tended to read ""two hond sword"" as being vaguely equivalent to a bastard sword or longsword, as this falls more closely into the English traditions Silver holds so dear. Such a longsword can also fall neatly into Silver's concepts of perfect proportion, even if they're not well suited to his preference for a basket or complex hilt. 

That said, the greatswords of the early modern period have much clearer advantage over just about every other kind of sword. A longsword only has clear advantage over the other weapon sets Silver mentions in armoured combat, whereas a greatsword has clear advantage in an unarmoured context as well. 

He then goes on to refer to ""battles"" separately from his initial list, and refers to the sword &amp; target and two-handed sword as being the preferable sword types, which fits into what we know. Problem being that a longsword and greatsword are both good battle swords for fighting without shield. But here's something:

&gt; Again the battle axe, the halberd, the black bill, the **two handed sword**, and sword &amp; target, among armed men and troops, **by reason of their weights, shortness, and great force**, do much more offend the enemy, &amp; are then much better weapons, than is the short staff, the long staff, or the forest bill.

He praises his two-handed sword for ""shortness"", among other things. A greatsword would infrequently exceed about 180cm in total length, placing alongside short polearms. But a vaguely longsword-ish type of weapon might also be praised for its force relative to ""shortness"", while fitting more closely into Silver's notions of an ideal sword. 

Or perhaps Silver doesn't even distinguish terribly between them? Before his time, throughout the 13th-14th centuries, the first ""common"" European two-handed swords emerged. They were essentially larger, longer, wider longswords. These would be refined to meet the needs of a more heavily armoured context through the 14th century, becoming the longswords we're more familiar with. After that, the early modern greatsword would emerge and be used around Silver's time, but was not a terribly common weapon. A two-handed ""longsword"" style weapon would still be more frequently encountered. 

Perhaps, to Silver, a longsword is simply a two-handed sword of perfect proportion, and a greatsword is a two-handed sword of imperfect proportion -- just as a rapier is an imperfectly proportioned thrusting sword to him. It may also be worth noting that German sources, for all the German love of two-handers, never produce a clear, specialised greatsword fighting manual -- not even Meyer. It could be that longsword and greatsword are thought of as variants of one-another in such contexts, so perhaps this is common thinking in the era? Or at least to some fencing masters, or to more ""Germanic"" cultural perspectives. Romantic language masters, such as Spanish and Italians, seem to think of the greatsword as a more distinct entity.

India is not a poor country, India has massive income disparity between the richest and poorest. European nations and majority European ancestry colonies do not have this problem. 

India was sought after as a colonial possession because of its wealth of resources. The British East India Company initially founded all of the trade options between the various local rulers until they rebelled and corporate rule wasn’t enough anymore. Only then did Britain take direct control over India. 

African colonial possessions were a massive land grab in the late 1800s and early 1900s between various European powers. However, many African states had hundreds of years of colonial rule. 
They’re now failed states. Just look at Rhodesia. 
The only Sub-Saharan country that seems to have risen above white minority colonial rule, while also not killing its white minority, is Botswana. Consequently it has the highest HDI in sub-Saharan Africa. Nowhere near the levels of South American countries like Argentina and Chile, but still a beacon of hope for African countries forging their own path and not just genociding the white minority Just for being white. 

(Side note, Argentina and Chile are also the ‘whitest’ countries in South America. There is a direct correlation between whiteness, population% who identify as white and HDI. Is the HDI system biased and Euro-Centric? Possibly. Or are European values conducive to a successful society, irregardless of race? Probably)

I know that a lot of Americans like to distill things in terms of race. It’s unsurprising when your majority is only 68% white and you’ve had segregation laws. But to most Europeans this concept is bizarre. I know for a fact that the UK has never had racial segregation laws, and our population is still 88%+ white. 
Most countries in Europe are 80%+ white. Europe is still a white continent. White people come from Europe. America doesn’t understand this and American racial hegemony and social science doesn’t understand this at all. 
When American culture spills over to Europe there is a far larger backlash than in America (even though Trump won and is preserving American values day by day). But it shows in the number of right wing parties growing ever more present in all the European states. 
Anti-EU sentiment is rife and Anti-Immigration is rife. 
It’s not racist to want to preserve your culture. 
Push too hard and there is backlash, and will win. And we do win.

All it's going to do is piss Trump off and as for those districts, they're aware that foreign governments are specifically targeting them to try and flip their votes. If I know one thing about Republicans and Americans in general is that they notice that kind of thing and don't react favourably. Which means they tend to resist whatever you're doing.  
The scary thing about it is that if there's one thing about Trump, it's that he's proven to be adept at playing the game and you don't want to fuck with him for no reason.  
Look at his sponsors of terrorism travel ban. He put it in and Trudeau immediately sent out a virtue-signalling tweet about how accepting we are of refugees. Since then, our border has been flooded with economic migrants posing as asylum seekers which ironically enough, prevents us from helping actual refugees.  
The EU is insane for getting involved. They're cracking already and America could easily do trade deals with the break-away countries only. Think of what a boon a ton of American trade could be to a post-Brexit UK and how that could affect voters in the rest of the member states? America is a huge market.  
As for those tariffs, they may be targeted at specific congressional districts but I'll tell you right now they're going to hit lower income shoppers and farmers very hard, drive up the price of an awful lot of goods and increase government spending on their projects.  
Plus, if the US congress stays blue which is to be expected then Trump might retaliate hard on Canada economically before our election the year after. I might note that US car manufacturers are tightening up their lines right now and it's very plausible that we could lose a bunch of plants.  
It's just so stupid.

Scale is THE fundamental aspect of these 2 states. And India is not coastal and never (for centuries) will be because of simple geography, i.e. population mass and fertile land is in the deep North, inland.  

China not having 2 coasts is not by itself a negative. It having land routes to Eurasian land mass is a positive. Geography is not destiny. Its how you use it  and the era, that matters.  

US is an example. US geography is good when Asia is in turmoil. When Asia is calm and on the up, US can never compete because its just way too far relative to those who are already here.

Say before the tariffs Canada was pricing their steel at $50, now they're forced to price at $60. US mills who were forced to price at $50 before to compete are not going to keep their price at $50, because the equilibrium price is now $60 in the US. Commodity prices are very liquid.

Here's the benchmark steel prices as of May 28 (when the threat of tariffs have already been priced in, but they haven't been implemented yet): ([source](http://steelbenchmarker.com/files/history.pdf))

for the same standard hot-rolled band: $555/mt in China, $657/mt in Western Europe, $976/mt in the Eastern US. US prices have gone up about 5% since then.

Over a longer period, yes, US producers would have to shift to meet domestic demand, but the catch is they'll be losing productivity to do it. For example approximately 90% of the steel used in US car manufacturing are from American steel mills, but the other 10% are highly specialized steel (for example for the catalytic chamber) sourced elsewhere (mostly sweden and germany iirc). For a US mill to make it would be uneconomical, just because for some special grades there isn't enough demand to make it profitable or there's a lack the knowhow to do it efficiently.

False,spartan2600,,,[],,,,text,"I was a big fan of Federici, until I read criticism of her, which points out the poor and often reactionary sources she used-

&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe Chapter 31 refutes the idea that women were more likely to participate in heresys (their participation was in fact lower) 

&gt;Her sources on contraception and abortion are from John T. Noonan a very very conservative Catholic judge (appointed initially by Regan) with no training in history whatsoever.  His book is revisionism by the modern church with little if any serious basis in history.

[Caliban and The Witch is Garbage History](http://thepeacockangel.tumblr.com/post/146232947104/caliban-and-the-witch-is-garbage-history)

Federici also assumes there was a hard line between what we might call 'good' Christians and heretics. This myth has been dispelled indisputably since at least the 1970's. Christians in good standing with the church and the community often practiced heretical acts.

Modern scholarship indicates the most heretical were often nobles, but Federici paints the heretics as universally marginalized.

So yeah, Federici's work has a lot of good uses and is provocative, but it isn't good scholarship.

Here is another, but more sympathetic criticism:

&gt;Federici selects dispossession as a major cause. Yet dispossessing farmers of their lands, villagers of their community links and women of their crafts and skills was only a negative condition, a necessary albeit insufficient condition. Caliban &amp; the Witch is marred by the omission of essential “push” factors. The historical account does not add up. It neither supplements nor enriches Capital : it goesa completely divergent way.

&gt; Why? Because Federici’s vision of primitive accumulation is fuelled by a definition of capitalism that is worlds apart from that of Marx.

[Federici versus Marx - Gilles Dauvé](https://libcom.org/library/federici-versus-marx-gilles-dauv%C3%A9)

&gt;I remember when I first Silvia Federici's Caliban and the Witch I liked its synthesis of autonomist Marxist emphasis on class struggle and Foucauldian 'politics of the body', situating the womens struggles as a site of class conflict. But I also had some nagging doubts about elements of the historical narrative.

'Territorial spat' - a 'spat' that's older than the US itself. There is so much more history in this little 'territory' than your entire country, it's probably difficult for you to understand. This makes for a very complex situation that goes back many, many generations.  
'Dublin ultimately wants to acquire some UK territory'- Do yourself a favour and stop reading Brittish tabloids. The simplicity of that statement proves your ignorance, but I suppose you can be forgiven given your nationality.  
If you truly followed the situation you'd be aware of a number of other, more important, issues:  
Violence - As mentioned above this is a complex situation that goes back a long time. All of our politicians remember the horrific violence that regularly occurred not that long ago in grand scheme of things. American diplomats came over and Nobel Peace prizes were given out when the GFA was signed. The situation has improved since then and nobody wants the return to that.  
On a related note - the Irish people voted to relinquish their claim to the 'northern territory', as you put it, when they signed the GFA. This was done to appease Unionists in the interest of peace.  
Trade - The Republic sends 1bn of trade up north and Northern Ireland sends down 4.5bn. That's close to 35% of Northern Ireland's foreign export market. What happens when tarrifs decimate this? People lose money, get angry, economic hardship is a sure fire way to bring us back 40 years to the days when bombings and shootings were all too regular.  
The British government have, in their view, far more pressing issues to deal with than Northern Ireland. In fact, many in Northern Ireland have become disillusioned with the contempt the British government have for the situation. Peace and prosperity in the North are far more important than 'acquiring some British territory' as this benefits everyone on this island economically and socially.  
And finally, yes, there has been talk of a United Ireland. But we wouldn't be acquiring territory. If it does go ahead it will be two countries joining together rather than an annexation. There's talk of a new flag, new national anthem etc so that a new nation would be for everyone.  
One last thing, Brussels is aware of all of the above. They're not about to throw one of their members under a bus at the expense of the UK who voted to leave.

Play a carry hero. I for one play Zenyatta, which although I never play solo anymore, can carry fights by getting an early transcendence and good discords.

Find a duo partner or more people to queue with. This is probably where I attribute my recent climbing to - a consistent, fun and high skilled player who plays a synergistic set of heroes to me. It really helps, plus allows you to relax about comps and take them less seriously, which allows you to get less tilted and have more fun. 

And finally, if you don't already, join voice and make calls anyway. It can't hurt, right? People can be in there listening, but not talking, plus it increases your skill as a shotcaller even if nobody is listening, which can allow you to climb as it optimizes your play that little bit more.

I think it comes down to the language barrier found on EU servers, plus the apathetic nature of people below diamond in most cases. That's just me though.

I think you misunderstand the problem of the border.  Sure, contraband is an issue, and if the border is too porous (e.g. no checks), it would almost certainly breach international law.  

The problem would be with checks on legitimate business that are being imposed on the Catholic community even though they are overwhelmingly against it.

That's not an excuse for failing to comply with the law(!)

You mention military, etc.  I'm not sure you understand what a hard border is.  If you have a customs office on the border staffed by very polite people checking trucks, with not even a single police office in sight, then that is still a (very) hard border.

&gt;* When it comes to alcohol Italy is wine centric, but as an Italian have you ever tried and do you like cider and ale? Do you like it or not?.. And can you buy cider and ale in Italy?..

We drink less wine that you probably think, young drink more often beer than wine and cider is not unheard of but is a niche product.

&gt;* What does takeaway/takeout food in Italy consist of, what's it like??..

From pizza/pasta , to Indian, to kebab, Argentinean...


&gt;*  Well what do you Italians think about it?, do any of you feel the same way??..

It doesn't have a particular feel for us it's just the norm.

&gt;* What do you think of the sport of Rugby?, Is Rugby popular in Italy?

Used to be really disrespected it was seen as a sport for people with more muscle than brain. The 6 nation made it seen as a noble sport but is not mainstream yet.


&gt;* How much obesity is there in Italy?. How many fat people do you see everyday?

Relatively uncommon. Few enough to notice them.

&gt;* How popular or not is gym culture in Italy?, cuz in the uk we have a lot of young men who spend ages in the gym to get that muscular body

We have plenty of gyms but it's usually not an obsession .


&gt;* Is Italy a individualist or community orientated country?

Depends by the context


&gt;* Do you like curry or not and why?, What do you think of it?, Is curry popular in Italy??.


Rice with curry chicken is so popular that even the most traditional trattorie have started having it on the menu. Why? We like the taste

&gt;* Is anime a thing in Italy?

Definitely. Especially since the 90s generation grew up with Japanese cartoons.


&gt;* What would you say are the main differences between Italian people and British people??. And on a cultral &amp; societal level what are the differences between Italy and Britain??.. And vice versa what are the similarities(if there are any?) between Italiand/Italy and Brits/Britain?..

The British tend to respect rules more than us when they are sober and a lot less when the are drunk. In general British people tend to have a way worse relationship with alcohol. British people are very emotionally repressed imo and have a wider concept of personal space. And young  Brits tend to be way more sensitive and arguably soft skinned in comparison to their Italian counterpart.

Those of course are generalisations :)


&gt;* In Italy are Brits considered to attractive/hot/sexy??.

Women no. Men if they can live up to the gentleman stereotype have an advantage yes.

&gt;* Are most Italians pro or anti British?

We have not much of a strong opinion either way. But we like you more than the Germans and the French that is enough?


&gt;* I just wanna know what's the ordinary Italian person's opinion of the Italy's past, present and above all future?. Where do they see Italy's and humanity going in future?.

For the past depends a lot from the time, present is seen as messy and the future scary.

&gt;* Do you notice your own Italian accent when speaking English?, what do you think of it?, are you like embarrassed or not?. And do you find it annoying when so many ppl try to imitate/mock your accent?.

Sometimes. I find it cringy and try to hide it. I believe they are idiots. 

&gt;* What does the Italian school cirriculum consist of?. What do you learn about?..

Depends a lot from age and when it comes to high school of the type of high school.


&gt;* I am also curious on how much do Italian students learn about Britain? Do you learn about the Celts, Romans, Saxons, British Empire, Industrial Revolution, The Middle Ages etc? and are basics beyond trading and wars covered, or do go more in-depth or is it just those two main topics?. Just what do you learn about the UK?... I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people(and culture too)?, Do you like Brits?..

Well from memory: Caesar, the Adrian wall, Elizabeth I, American revolution very briefly, the East India company, Napoleonic wars, industrial revolution, Victoria, the western front in ww1, Ireland independence, Churchill, Ghandi.

In history depends of the period since our history programs are focused on Italy and the surrounding.So the more you impacted here the more you get covered. In English class we tend to go a bit deeper . For the UK mostly ghografical facts . 

Aside the usual XIX c. Stereotypes we tend to conflate your culture with American one.

&gt;* When it comes to things like sex and porn are you prudish, awkward and puritanical, is it a big taboo to openly discuss such matters, like do Italian ppl like to pretend it doesnt exist? etc... Well my question is what's it like in Italy?. Are you like that or are you much more open about sex and porn?.. 

The reason why I believe people think we are prudish is that they rarely have the capacity to understand us when at the bar or coffee machine.

&gt;* What's Italy's view of sex and porn?..

Part of life.

&gt;* Is Feminism a thing in Italy?, And if feminism is a thing is it out of control like in other parts of Western Europe?...

Sort of. If you mean Tumblr feminism ? No. Well not even Tumblr is particularly a thing.


&gt;* Are most Italian men uncut or not?..

Circumcision is jew/Muslim thing here. Like all of Europe I think.


&gt;* What is the LGBT situation like in Italy?, do they have rights?, Is LGBT and being gay accepted socially and cultrally??. Just whats it like being gay or trans in Italy?..

Complex. We have civil partnership and anti discrimination laws. Depends a lot of were you live the bigger less rural the place is the more it is accepted.


&gt;* What types of music are popular in Italy?. 

Rap, pop, rock. 

&gt;* What do you Italian guys &amp; girls listen too?..

Depends from age/personal taste. You can find easily our top 50 chart on the internet.

&gt;* What are race relations like in Italy?..

Limited due to recent emigration and using the term race in a context that is not dog breeds will make people look down of you due to fascism.

&gt;* What are foreigner relations like in Italy??..

Depends of the country.


&gt;* What are the police like?.. how good(or not) are the Italian police?..

Carabinieri are usually chill. Polizia is more harsh (nothing in comparison to the us tho). 

&gt;* What are Italian unis like?.. how good(or not) are Italian Universities?..

Depends from the University. But in general they tend to be good but with a stronger preference to theory over practice. 


&gt;* What is the Italian school system like?... How good(or not) is the Italian school system?..

Depends from the region. The more north you go the better it is. It's improving but needs more founds.

&gt;* What is the healthcare system like?... How good(or not) is the Italian healthcare system?..

Very good. Italians are found of it and the WHO classified it second worldwide. But the quality varies from the region in the usual way.


&gt;* What is Italian TV like?.. how good(or not) is Italian television??..

Now we have a tons of channels so it's hard to say. But is seen as a hold people thing.


&gt;* What with all the mass immigration etc.. Is Italy really as hell-holish and 3rd world as it can often looks on TV?. Like it parts of it look really awful. Well my question is: what's like living in Italy right now??, Is it a tough daily struggle for survival?. Do you feel like the Italian people on the verge of being consigned to history?..

No. And anglosaxon press it's  usually prone to stereotypes and costan hysteria.

False,gimlet-nosed,,,[],,,,text,"&gt; Not organising something in time isn't just plausible behaviour for May's government, it's practically her signature move.

You seem to be assuming that the government is the only body that is doing planning. Businesses have carried on past the referendum with resilience, and the electorate have stood their ground irrespective of what has happened between governments. 

It's only the governmental and liberal intelligentsia classes that are struggling with Brexit, and that's mostly due to psychological factors rather than practical ones. 

A lot of business problems can be solved rather easily. For example a huge amount of goods is transshipped via Rotterdam, Antwerp, Zeebrugge etc. Putting such goods on a direct ship would avoid any EU complications altogether. 

For another example a lot of the fear centres on the prospects of a 'permanent Operation Stack. That is absurd, because the only reason that Operation Stack exists is because the problems that require it are so rare that it isn't worth rearranging supply chains for. If you know you may have problems at Dover then you can choose from many other ports that are equipped to deal with WTO terms goods, and the somewhat longer sea journey gives longer for customs to ok the paperwork. 

Much depends on the behaviour of shipping companies, and it's possible that too many companies will switch to the same routes at the same time leading to overcongestion, but such problems should be sorted in time. Meanwhile, the prudent importing business would be keeping a bigger buffer of EU goods to tide them over this initial period.

That's actually changing: [overall U.S. light vehicle sales started dropping this month](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2018/06/us-light-vehicle-sales-decrease-to-169.html).

Which is a puzzling market development given that [personal income keeps going up](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2018/05/personal-income-increased-03-in-april.html) and demographics growth requires more new cars as well.

But it's less surprising if you consider that now [a record 50 million U.S. consumers want their next car to be an EV](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/05/08/electric-cars-aaa/586987002/), an increase in EV demand by +33% over the previous year.

The change from ICE cars to EVs will likely be very abrupt, [similar to historic adoption rates of disruptive technologies](https://simplecore.intel.com/itpeernetwork/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/05/adoption-rate-chart.png).

If 50 million customers decided that they want an EV then the first step would be for them to stop buying ICE cars (stop buying sedans first, as most EVs are sedans) - and first indicators of this process might be visible in the data already.

Yeah I think most Americans have the wrong idea about what prison should be. Prisons are *correctional facilities*. All they should do is correct the way criminals behave. I don't want to take a hit to my own quality of life just to make them suffer. I'll happily pay my part to rehabilitate the criminal, but paying more for punishment *for its own sake,* punishes me - not just  the criminal.

Punishment that's incidental to the process of rehabilitation is fine, maybe certain restrictions on what they can and can't do, but I don't want to pay extra for punishment alone.

&gt;And what about America's thousands of homeless, most of whom are law abiding except for minor nuisance crimes??

&gt; (If we are going to house anyone for free, law abiding homeless should be first on the list.) 

I already think the homeless [should be housed anyway.](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/mar/22/finland-solved-homelessness-eu-crisis-housing-first) You're just telling me conservatives are wrong on multiple issues.

&gt;Housing First means ending homelessness instead of managing it. The basic idea is to offer permanent housing and needs-based support for homeless people instead of temporary accommodation in hostels or in emergency shelters. Permanent housing means an independent rental flat with own rental contract.

&gt;In Housing First people do not have to earn their right to housing by proving their capability to manage their lives. Instead, they are provided with a stable home and individually tailored support.

&gt;Since 2008 the national homelessness strategy in Finland has been based on the Housing First model, as a result of dedicated cooperation between the state, municipalities and NGOs.

&gt;Finland has all but eradicated rough sleeping and sustainably housed a significant number of long-term homeless people. Finland is the only country in Europe where the number of homeless people has declined in recent years.

This is absolute horseshit. US food standards are well below those of the EU. 

It's why, if Britain ever leaves the EU, they will be able to import lots of cheap, shit food from the US.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/29/hormonal-beef-chlorine-chicken-could-coming-uk-trade-deal-us/

 This includes things like chlorinated chicken, beef from cattle stuffed with hormones, steroids, ractopamine, and endocrine disrupters (chemicals that mess with animals’ hormones and can cause cancer and birth defects) banned in the EU, more pesticides on vegetables, more GM crops. The EU may have problems but when it comes to food safety it is a world leader. 

US officials have said themselves that Britain will need to lower standards (EU-imposed) if it wants a trade deal.

&gt;Chlorine-washed chicken is only one of the foodstuffs the US will want to import into the UK if it secures a bilateral trade deal after the UK leaves the EU. The overuse of antibiotics, hormone-treated beef and dairy and GM crops are commonplace in US farming. British farmers will struggle to compete with these imports unless they abandon EU standards themselves. Together with our reliance on EU agricultural workers and food imports and the impact of slower supply chains, Brexit – particularly if it involves leaving the Single Market and Customs Union – will seriously undermine food security in the UK, says Erik Millstone (University of Sussex).

It doesn't mean one specific thing and you cannot say that one blockchain is decentralized and the other one is not. It's just not that black and white. Every blockchain has forms of centralization, for example they are all under control of humans and they all require internet. Most projects are under full control of a small group of developers, or even just a single developer.

Some chains seem to be decentralized, but they are heavily concentrated on AWS, or even worse, Microsoft Azure. So they _seem_ to be under control of many individuals, but they are actually fully under USA jurisdiction. Also, many projects rely on the .IO-tld, but most people don't know that this is actually the jurisdiction of the British Indian Ocean Territory. Attacks are not only possible here in theory, but also fairly trivial. The last weeks we have seen 51% attacks at Verge and Bitcoin Gold, chains that are considered to be decentralized. Bitcoin and Ethereum have done a reasonable good job decentralizing, but they have the same flaws and in theory anyone (fully anonymous) could do a 51% attack on the chain.

Now back to NEO. The current situation of NEO is that both the seed nodes and consensus nodes are decentralized in terms of hosting. The servers are not under the jurisdiction of any single government, some are hosted in China, some in North America and some in Europe. They are still all under control of NEO Foundation. The long term goal of NEO (the community, developers and the foundation) is to distribute this control over de consensus nodes to multiple legal entities. The software is ready for this, but the process to actually get there is delicate. The result will be beautiful. Not fully distributed consensus over any number of anonymous entities, but through verifiable delegation. Any user can vote for trusted well-known legal entities to participate in the consensus. Any possible bad actor would be a well-known and verified legal entity. In the case that a consensus node would successfully get attacked, consensus would stop until the problem is resolved. Considering that NEO would eventually have one or two dozens of consensus nodes, the network will be more decentralized and have far better protection than Ethereum and Bitcoin, where a 51% attack will always be possible.",True,False,0,1528023933,,False,0,e01bajk,False,t3_8o5igg,False,t1_e018mtb,/r/NEO/comments/8o5igg/how_is_the_development_of_the_neo_blockchain/e01bajk/,,1532144527,markdown,6,False,True,False,NEO,t5_2qky3,public,

&gt;In the United States, pay toilets became much less common from the 1970s, when they came under attack from feminists as well as from the plumbing industry. California legislator March Fong Eu argued that they discriminated against women because men could use urinals for free whereas women always had to pay a dime for a toilet stall in places where payment was mandatory.[4] The American Restroom Association was a proponent of an amendment to the National Model Building Code to allow pay toilets only where there were also free toilets.[5] A campaign by the Committee to End Pay Toilets in America (CEPTIA) resulted in laws prohibiting pay toilets in some cities and states. In 1973, Chicago became the first American city to enact a ban, at a time when, according to the Wall Street Journal, there were at least 50,000 units in America,[6] mostly made by the Nik-O-Lok Company.[7] CEPTIA was successful over the next few years in obtaining bans in New York, New Jersey, Minnesota, California, Florida and Ohio.[7] Lobbying was successful in other states as well, and by the end of the decade, pay toilets were greatly reduced in America. However, they are still in use and produced by the Nik-O-Lok company; many of these laws have since been repealed, such as in Ohio. In 2007, legislators rescinded ORC Ordinance 4101:1-29-02.6.2, the ban on pay facilities, paving the way for operators to charge for public restroom use.[8]

&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; The medals, the honors, the general’s uniform—all had been stripped away. Arnaldo Ochoa, once considered a great hero of the Cuban Revolution and its military expeditions in Africa, stood before Fidel Castro’s court in 1989 wearing a cheap plaid shirt. He looked like what he had always been, the handsome and charismatic son of Cuban peasants, a man of the people, a leader, and that may have been the real cause of his downfall. But the charges were narcotics trafficking and treason.
&gt; 
&gt; Ochoa’s trial was a pivotal moment in the history of Cuba and of what Washington in those days was calling “the war on drugs.” It marked the end of an era in which Fidel Castro’s dictatorship had facilitated the shipment of cocaine to the United States from the infamous cartels of Colombia, including Pablo Escobar’s operation in Medellín. And not the least of the motives attributed to the Cubans was the desire to tear at the fabric of _yanqui_ society. These were the days of the crack cocaine epidemic shattering the peace of cities across the United States. Fueling addiction, desperation and crime while enriching the Revolution must have seemed perfectly legitimate goals to some of the Castros' cohorts, and their intelligence services did what they thought they had to do for their regime to survive on its own terms.
&gt; 
&gt; There in the military tribunal in Cuba all was not as it seemed.
&gt; 
&gt; As in any of the show trials the world has read about or witnessed, whether conducted by Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, or the Castro brothers, the defendant made an abject confession to all the charges in the court, and with pitiful vehemence exculpated his superiors: Fidel’s brother Raúl, the chief of the armed forces who had promoted Ochoa so many times, was innocent of any complicity, and so, of course, was Fidel.
&gt; 
&gt; The press in the United States and Europe theorized Ochoa might have been tortured or drugged. Even in the military tribunal, not-so-veiled threats were made against his family if he did not cooperate. Perhaps, as[one observer put it](http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/files6/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_14631_12785.pdf), he believed there was some remote possibility of a pardon in exchange for his confessions, although that would have been offered only “in the darkness of his cell.”
&gt; 
&gt; The idea that the Castro brothers knew nothing about the drug trafficking was perfectly absurd. Cuba was a country where, as the saying goes, “not a leaf moved on a tree” unless the Castros wanted it to.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact the officer accused as Ochoa’s key accomplice, Antonio De la Guardia, was in charge of a special department in the Ministry of Interior, which is the center of the Cuban state security operations. His operation was known by the initials MC (for Moneda Convertible, or convertible currency) and its mission as part of the Cuban Foreign Trade Corporation (CIMEX) was to thwart the U.S. trade embargo.
&gt; 
&gt; According to an editorial in the official Cuban Communist Party organ _Granma_ at the time of the trial, these modern blockade runners smuggled medicines, medical equipment, computer gear, spare parts—anything that “could be useful to the country.” To do this, MC had connections with citizens and residents in the United States, as well as boats and planes to transport the goods. This was all legitimate in the face of the “criminal blockade” by the U.S., _Granma_ told its readers. And those who carried out these operations were “rigorously” prohibited from any involvement with anyone trafficking narcotics.
&gt; 
&gt; No doubt those rules had been fudged. The drug-running took place at a moment when things were looking desperate for the Cuban Revolution. The Soviet Union was on the verge of disintegration, the Berlin Wall was about to fall, and the Kremlin no longer wanted to underwrite its obstreperous little satellite off the coast of Florida. This, while pressure from Washington about Cuba’s involvement in narcotics trafficking had been building for years.
&gt; 
&gt; By the early 1980s, indictments were being handed down and defectors were exposing operations one after another. In 1982, a federal grand jury in Miami indicted four Cuban officials. Among the accused, the vice-admiral in charge of the Cuban Navy, and an intelligence officer who had organized the chaotic, vindictive Mariel boatlift in 1980, exporting not only legitimate refugees but dangerous criminals to U.S. shores.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1987, the deputy commander of the Cuban air force defected, and focused attention on the activities of CIMEX. Another defector claimed Colombian traffickers had a fleet of 13 ships and 21 aircraft operating in Cuban territory. A third defector, a longtime Cuban intelligence operative, alleged that the “special troops” unit of the Cuban interior ministry coordinated all drug shipments. (De la Guardia had been part of the special troops.) Fidel supposedly stashed 80 percent of the hard currency in the banks of Panama, where [Manuel Noriega](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-biggest-drug-bust-in-history) had taken over as strongman.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1988, five members of a Miami-based drug ring were convicted of smuggling $10 million worth of cocaine into the U.S. through Cuba the year before, and one of the conspirators fingered De la Guardia and his operation at the Ministry of Interior’s MC department.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Raúl Castro, for his part, saw the scandal as a way to purge his enemies and potential competitors for the succession, with Ochoa first on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Emilio T. Gonzales, who would serve on George W. Bush’s national security council and in the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in a 1997 paper ([PDF](https://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=csa)) that with the Ochoa trial, “Fidel and Raul Castro hoped to bury long-standing allegations of Cuban drug smuggling along with their potential political rival.”
&gt; 
&gt; At two in the morning, July 13, 1989, just a month after the first announcement that Ochoa had been arrested, he and De la Guardia and two of their alleged fellow conspirators were taken into a field next to the Baracoa air base east of Havana and shot.
&gt; 
&gt; One chapter in the annals of Cuban involvement with drug runners was coming to an end, but more subtle and complex relationships would would soon begin centered on Colombia and Venezuela—two countries much bigger, more populous, and much richer than Cuba.
&gt; 
&gt; In the years that followed the Ochoa trial, Cuba offered to cooperate with the United States fighting against drug traffickers. The Clinton administration shelved proposed indictments of the regime, and as relations gradually warmed, the U.S. would begin to liaise with Cuban authorities in the war on drugs. But at the same time the Cuban intelligence services were reaching out in other directions, to networks that would become the world’s biggest suppliers of cocaine: the narco-guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and Venezuela’s security forces. Cuban counterintelligence is said to have tutored the Venezuelan spies, domestic and foreign, and helped to organize them to root out opposition to the regime of Hugo Chávez. Indeed, the Cubans taught them to do whatever might be necessary to survive.
&gt; 
&gt; Over time, many of Chavez’s officers would become known as the _Cartel de los Soles_, the Cartel of the Suns: “cartel” because of their involvement with the drug trade on a scale that nobody in 1989 could have imagined; “the suns” for the insignias on the epaulets of Venezuela’s generals.
&gt; 
&gt; Under Nicolás Maduro, just given a second term last month in a system-rigged re-election, Venezuela has become a full blown economic, political and criminal disaster, most likely [headed for a showdown](https://www.thedailybeast.com/rumors-of-war-with-the-us-run-rampant-in-venezuela?ref=author) with its neighbors and with Washington. And the traffickers in the government not only continue to thrive, their corruption has become vital to the cohesion and survival of the regime.
&gt; 
&gt; “Their stake is very high,” says Frank O. Mora at the Cuba Research Institute of Florida International University. “They fear they are going to be persecuted if they lose power.”

In theory, this makes complete sense. Ideas of racial superiority and hyper-nationalism are inherently destructive, and the world is much safer without them.

But you're right that the postwar order is now being challenged, not just in Europe and America but throughout the world. Why? I can think of a few reasons:

1. The horror of war is starting to fade from living memory, and new generations may not fully understand the importance of the postwar order.
2. The postwar liberal consensus has been abused. Activists have found that, if you want to make some social change, the fastest way is to try and shove it into the liberal consensus, even if it has nothing to do with preventing war. In this way everything from opposing mandatory vaccination to believing there are only two genders has become a violation of the liberal consensus. While, in the short run, this might help progressives achieve their goals, in the long run it has built up an ever larger coalition to oppose the liberal consensus altogether.
3. In many important ways, the postwar order based on neoliberalism and the embrace of globalization has failed. Global inequality has dropped, but inequality within most countries is skyrocketing.

False,Not_for_consumption,,,[],,,,text,"The regulations in the UK are vastly different from those in the USA. In short the UK is much more heavily regulated that the USA where you can apparently sell any crap for any reason (from our point of view). Others have pointed out that she needs to negotiate the rules about importing anything from outside the EU.

The regulatory compliance issue in terms of selling (""marketing"") the product in the UK comes down to whether this is a food, a medicine, or a *herbal medicine*. From your description it appears she is falling under the latter category and then she'll have to follow that pathway (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-traditional-herbal-registration-thr#how-to-apply). That's not great for her because she'll need to *include scientific evidence with your application relating to the safety, quality and traditional use of the herbal product*. I doubt that she'll meet that standard. But if she wants to say that *this tea will treat this condition* then that is the standard in the UK.

It seems that the easier path is to import the tea as a food and  comply with Food Services Authority rules for importing foods from outside the EU. The first step would be to check that there aren't any restrictions on these plants (see ""Foodstuffs with current European Union (EU) restrictions"") because if they are restricted then it's all over - but realistically a herbal infusion from the USA almost certainly isn't restricted. But then she'll need to comply with any rules the FSA has for importing plant products from outside the UK/EU (actually it's ""products of non-animal origin"").

The problem she has is if she is going to market these teas as herbal medicines which appears to be her plan. That turns a relatively simple process into a regulatory challenge. Best that she seeks formal legal opinion on this one. I'd start listing every herb, whether it is a food or herbal medicine, whether it has  any EU restriction, and whether it is currently marketed in the UK, whether the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (""MHRA"") has listed it as a herbal medicine, whether the MHRA has restricted it or banned it, and then I'd take my excel spreadsheet to a lawyer and say I want to import and market this stuff.

It goes without saying that the products better label their ingredients and she'd better have a clear idea of the active ingredient and any excipients especially any potentially active or toxic additives. Add that to the spreadsheet. Consider that herbal medicines are common targets for adulterants so it is best to try to know exactly what is in the thing she is selling. That's another difference with the US and UK, it is possible to adulterate ""herbal"" medicines in the USA with active substances and get away with it (IDK!). I recall one excellent paper that used DNA barcoding to identify that, in a sample of North American herbal medicines, 95% contained plant species not listed on the label, and 1/3 contained contaminants. There have been many other studies mostly focussing upon the very large market of Chinese herbal medicines. The common contaminants in TCMs are the heavy metals. That's pretty well documented (mercury most commonly). But a friend for laughs screened a number of TCMs imported from China for human DNA and it was present in all in large amounts (that poop btw, very gross). ***I'm getting a bit off track*** because I find that fascinating but the take home message is that you want to know exactly what is in the product and send it to your local toxicology lab if there is any concern (if you are importing a known plant then that really shouldn't be necessary but if it's some herbal preparation). The dna barcoding is a bit OTT (that's more done to test and show off the technique), just a tox screen for heavy metals and other bad stuff like, I dunno, arsenic and cyanide. Probably best to not sell tea containing arsenic. LifeProTip, if it smells like almonds then don't sip (unless it's an almond latte). Addit: another *very very good* DNA sequencing study found snow leopard (*Panthera uncia*) in a CHM. That sucks big time. 

So she has a bit of homework if she wants to market a herbal medicine in a regulated area such as the UK. The good news is that after Brexit she may be able to ignore EU regulations. Of course it's also possible that UK regulations will be worse for her. Either way it sounds like a fun project. It's completely do-able.

Addit: It also goes without saying that she'd better not provide medical advice without being appropriately registered.

Capitalism feeds into human base desire. If you want some kind of pleasure you'll be able to find it, even if it's illegal. Want fresh food? You can always have it because there's enough capital demand for it. This kind of desire/fulfillment relationship ends up using unsustainable amounts of resources, and creating unmanageable amounts of waste. There are billions of people starving, yet in Europe, America, and Asia there are stores throwing millions of tons of food away every year. 

Also consider the fact that anyone making over $36k-$70k a year is part of the top 1% of income earners in the world. If you live in a developed country and have a job, you're pretty much in the top 5% automatically. Yes you need to pay more on average to live, but that's because of the unsustainable desire/fulfillment system capitalism has naturally given rise to. 

Either we fix the issue of capitalism, it dies from its own drive to be ever more efficient (full automation), or it just collapses in the largest economic bust we'll have ever had. Capitalism cannot possibly grow indefinitely.

Ah guarda, su questo potrei raccontarti delle cose terrificanti sulla espropriazione per pubblica utilità: nella nostra Costituzione, su spinta della sua mezza anima rossa, non è espresso il principio che l'indennizzo dato al cittadino espropriato sia ""giusto"", cosa che negli anni ha legittimato il legislatore a consentire autentiche rapine a fronte di indennizzi ridicolosamente bassi. Solo di recente (anni duemila) la Corte Europea dei Diritti dell'Uomo ci ha messo una pezza, ma i contrasti continuano ancora oggi.

Tornando al conflitto tra libertà di iniziativa economica e tutela dei soggetti deboli io stesso mi chiedo sempre se tutti questi limiti che abbiamo ce li siamo dati perché noi italiani siamo fatti in un certo modo, o se noi italiani siamo fatti in un certo modo proprio perché abbiamo tutti questi limiti. Resto dell'idea che comunque, nonostante le porcherie sull'espropriazione di cui sopra, qualcosa di buono grazie al compromesso delle due anime della Costituente ci sia stato, anche perché l'iperliberalismo non è che sia stata sta figata (ma forse la lettura di Furore di Steinbeck ai tempi mi impressionò troppo) e che queste pronunce sul divieto di abuso un minimo di giustizia sostanziale possono portarla. È che dipende sempre dalla testardaggine e dalla disponibilità economica del ricorrente di turno di arrivare fino in Cassazione, così che il suo caso possa costituire un precedente, common law style, perché è in questo che ci stiamo trasformando.

I just had a quick look on the web, and more European countries had already had success in WW1 with full mobilization and floating debt in the form of war bonds.

Littlefinger [said it best (01:48)](https://youtu.be/KH7sIOBJqLA?t=1m48s).

more to the *histroical* points made in the video:

1. USSR would quite possibly have crumbled in 41 or 42 had they not received massive lend-lease from America. They also would likely not have been able to start counter attacking and moving forward in 43. but of course this does not detract from the huge sacrifice and effort made by the people in the great patriotic war - it can certainly be said that without it all the lend lease in the world wouldn't have mattered.

2. the video implies it was Truman who was responsible for the Cold War - but in reality of course Stalin did his part too - and more importantly - a geopolitical analysis of the situation post ww2 pretty much dictated that something along these lines would happen no matter the leaders and the decisions they took. Had FDR survived a little longer it *may* have been different *for a while* - because he was trusted by Stalin (who believed he was assassinated). But eventually the leaders would have been replaced either to election or natural causes (Stalin died in 53) and the same post war reality with ideological polar opposites, nuclear weapons and a massive military industrial complexes that need to be fed (among other things).

3. The atomic bombs being dropped on Japan and what caused the Empire's final surrender are highly contentious subjects among historians and military analysts - and none of the evidence brought forth is particularly convincing one way or the other. The fact that Gen. MacArthur or Gen. Eisenhower had expressed something along these lines does not mean that it is fact. MacArthur was a highly politically minded figure (FDR called him the most dangerous man in Washington - when he was in town) and could have many reasons to say this or that, while Eisenhower was in charge of the European front - not the Pacific. He surely was highly knowledgeable about all war matters but still this hardly strong enough evidence to conclude it was solely the Soviet invasion of Manchuria that prompted the surrender.

Okej, odrastali smo u različitim okruženjima. Jel ti nikada nisi imao siromašnijeg ili bogatijeg prijatelja? Jel impliciraš pošto smo mi Srbi odrasli u nekom zajedničkom okruženju da svi gledamo na prijateljstva na isti način?

Uhh ne znam da li te je neko obavestio, ali prosečna plata u Srbiji iznosi nešto ispod 400 eura, s tim da je prosek oko 350 eura izvan Beograda. Napominjem da je ovo prosek, a ne medijana (koja je mnogo gora).

&gt; A number of bands have gone by the name ""The Crusaders"":  
1) an American 1970s jazz-soul band
2) a European Oi band
3) an Australian garage surf band who recorded two albums in the late 1990s
4) a Christian garage band active 1966-67
5) a Country band from USA.

&gt; 1) The Crusaders is an American music group popular in the early 1970s for their amalgamated jazz, pop and soul sound. From 1961 to present more than forty albums have been credited to the group (some live and compilations), nineteen of which were recorded between 1961-1970 under the name ""The Jazz Crusaders"" prior to band name being shortened. 
Back in 1954, Houston pianist Joe Sample teamed up with high school friends tenor saxophonist Wilton Felder and drummer Stix Hooper to form the Swingsters. Within a short time, they were joined by trombonist Wayne Henderson, flutist Hubert Laws, and bassist Henry Wilson and the group became the Modern Jazz Sextet. With the move of Sample, Felder, Hooper, and Henderson to Los Angeles in 1960, the band (a quintet with the bass spot constantly changing) took on the name of the Jazz Crusaders. The following year they made their first recordings for Pacific Jazz and throughout the 1960s the group was a popular attraction, mixing together R&amp;B and Memphis soul elements with hard bop; its trombone/tenor frontline became a trademark. By 1971, when all of the musicians were also busy with their own projects, it was decided to call the group simply the Crusaders so it would not be restricted to only playing jazz. After a few excellent albums during the early part of the decade (with guitarist Larry Carlton a strong asset), the group began to decline in quality. In 1975, the band's sound radically changed when Henderson departed to become a full-time producer. 1979's ""Street Life"", with guest vocalist Randy Crawfordand the album also called Street Life was a hit, a year later followed by Soul Shadows, sung by Bill Withers and the album Rhapsody and Blues. With Hooper's decision to leave in 1983, the group no longer sounded like the Crusaders and gradually disbanded. In the mid-'90s, Henderson and Felder had a reunion as the Crusaders but in reality only Joe Sample has had a strong solo career.

In Italy you can still find, in certain regions, people named Ivan and Igor, because their parents were staunch communists, and streets and squares dedicated to Kennedy, Newton, etc. etc. Italy had the biggest communist party in the western world, there's even an entire city in Russia dedicated to one of Italy's foremost postwar political leaders (Togliatti, in russian Tolyatti). Italy also has a big immigrant community in the US, sits squarely in the middle of the Mediterranean and has a track record of participating in US-led missions that would actually surprise americans, as I think it's only second to the UK (or actually even with the UK, I'm not sure). Italy has always used this geopolitical tactic of holding with the hare and running with the hounds. This attitude has also bled in cultural and societal parts of the country (for example, the russians are just as italophile as the americans, when it comes to the culture and the cuisine). So if you take this into consideration, it makes perfect sense for italians to have a relatively high opinion of both the US and Russia, as we have been historically the mediator and the main european battlefield between the two powers. Of course, if you don't know about any of this, Italy relatively warm disposition towards Russia makes little sense. The thing is, most non-italian commentators of italian politics are not really well versed in italian history, except for the most salient points. Their italophilia also colours their judgement and basically renders them incapable of understanding what happens in the country at a given time, hence the dime a dozen articles about how Italy is puzzling, self-contradictory and chaotic for the sake of being chaotic, which by this time has become a part of Italy's image as much as the dolce vita, the passionate gesturing and the mafia (seriously, I invite you to check a random r/worldnews or r/europe comment section, or even skim some articles about Italy's political situation at any given point, you'll usually get some people asking for explanation, and people just saying that Italy is just chaotic and everything there makes no sense). 

TLDR: the reasons why italians ""like"" Russia are historical and geopolitical, and are also the same reason why Italy also has a very high opinion of the US. The reason why non-italians don't get it is because if you don't know the history of Italy, much like any other country, nothing makes sense ever; unlike other countries, there's no pressure on looking up this history, and this has bled into pop culture into implying that Italy is naturally random and nothing actually makes sense.

Also financial deregulation allowing prices to spiral to absurd levels.

The housing market boomed during Thatcher's term of office, to blame her for the housing crisis that materialised decades after her leaving office is absurd. Her successors had just as much power as she did and it's basically like blaming Attlee for the Winter of Discontent. Councils were only banned from reinvesting the majority of the proceeds until they cleared their debt, a policy which the Labour governments of Blair and Brown happened to agree with. House prices have consistently increased as far back as the end of the second world war; thanks to the discounts offered by Right to Buy home ownership has risen for most of the last thirty years.

&gt; The deprivation in all of the towns where she destroyed their main industries without putting anything in place to support those who were suddenly unemployed.

Obviously this isn't something easy to brush aside though it really has to be said that the idea of deindustrialisation culminating seamlessly by the Eighties is really nothing more than fantasy. Had Labour been in power they would have likely continued to delay the inevitable and ultimately there would have been twice as much hardship both in terms of the UK and local economies, which would have neared, if not reached, bankruptcy by that time. This quote by Thatcher is a good summation of what she tried to do to compensate those who suddenly found themselves unemployed.

&gt; [First, we had to put the balances of the industries we wanted to sell in good order. Where redundancies had to be made because of overmanning we were determined to ensure that those who lost their jobs would receive a capital sum related to the length of their service. For the first time in their lives this put capital into their hands and each industry helped them to find other jobs or to set up businesses of their own. Thus we made clear our concern to look after those who were losing their livelihoods as well as those who were staying on.](https://reason.org/privatization-report/apr-2006-margaret-thatcher-reb/)

&gt; The state of the railways and other monopoly services that were sold off.

The railways were privatised by Major. As for Thatcher's view on the privatisation of monopoly services, I think this quote speaks for itself 

&gt; [Merely to replace state monopolies by private ones would be to waste an historic opportunity. So we will take steps to ensure that these new firms do not exploit their powerful positions to the detriment of consumers or their competitors. Those nationalised industries which cannot be privatised or organised as smaller and more efficient units will be given top-quality management and required to work to clear guidelines.](https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/110859)

&gt; Thatcher cancelled the project so that it could be put out to tender and instead we ended up with what eventually became Virgin, a comparatively second-rate service (FTTC instead of FTTH) that only served major cities instead of everybody.

She cancelled it to preclude a private monopoly that she believed would stifle competition. Clearly her reasoning was fuzzy in retrospect though at the time it was an utterly rational position to take. Had she had the benefit of hindsight in the late 80s then it would make perfect sense to denigrate her, but she didn't and the concept of the Internet was still in its very early stages back then.

&gt; Her fans talk about how well she did with the economy, but that's not even that accurate. The truth of it is that she got lucky with the discovery of North Sea oil and that propped-up her actions.

All signs seem to indicate that the war on climate change is headed absolutely nowhere.
&gt; 
&gt; 

If all you pay attention to is Canada and American government, sure. Globally, developing countries have been ramping up renewable energy investment and currently invest *more* than the more developed, wealthier west. One of the main reasons the ""war on climate change"" is going so poorly is because we, the primary drivers of climate change, are unwilling to actually address our own behaviour. [Here](https://www.devex.com/news/china-developing-countries-lead-in-renewable-and-solar-energy-investment-92474) is an article breaking it down, but essentially:

&gt;**Developing economies increased their renewable energy investments by 20 percent last year, committing $177 billion to renewables. Developed countries saw a drop of 19 percent, meanwhile, and invested $103 billion.** The losses were particularly sharp in Europe, which had a 36 percent decline. This marks a continued upward green energy investment trend for developing countries, which first surpassed developed nations in their investment in 2015.

.

&gt;A huge hurdle is that battery technology for electric cars is so woefully far from where it needs to be that they hardly even present a better environmental alternative than a high efficiency gas powered car.

The problem here is looking for a car to replace a car. Even if we ignore the carbon emissions issue from gas powered cars, they're still incredibly resource intense and will do nothing to solve secondary drivers of pollution like traffic congestion and the resource extraction, shipping, etc required to mass-produce cars. Replace 30 cars with 1 bus and you're making a lot more progress towards solving the problem than replacing 30 gas cars with 30 electric cars.

Un job qui le ravit, dégoté grâce à un ancien professeur. « Je n’ai pas de hiérarchie, je ne rends de comptes à personne. Je ne veux pas à avoir à contraindre mon expression. Personne ne reprochera jamais à un avocat d’avoir une prise de parole. »

Il reconnaît tout de même qu’il a été plus aisé pour lui, énarque de 40 ans, de retrouver une bonne situation, que pour d’autres. Pour se recaser, en réalité, mieux vaut être haut fonctionnaire que travailleur dans le privé, et homme que femme. Une rapide radiographie des anciens ministres de François Hollande est éclairante. Pour favoriser la parité, la gauche, notamment, a fait émerger des femmes issues du monde associatif ou de l’entreprise, quand les hommes sont plus traditionnellement recrutés dans les grands corps de l’Etat. Résultat, elles cumulent les handicaps quand il faut s’inventer une autre vie. Les préjugés ont également la vie dure. Emmanuelle Cosse constate qu’« on laisse moins un homme sans boulot qu’une femme », comme si les employeurs se disaient « une femme a toujours son foyer pour s’occuper ».

Sur la touche
Pour ceux qui n’ont pu y couper, découvrir les joies de Pôle emploi a été un choc. Christophe Sirugue, 51 ans, éphémère secrétaire d’Etat socialiste chargé de l’industrie puis du numérique, avait consacré toute sa vie à la politique jusqu’à la déroute de 2017. « Je n’ai pas fait de grandes écoles, je viens d’un milieu modeste, je suis un pur apparatchik. Il fallait que je gagne ma vie, j’étais très inquiet. En une journée, on passe de député à rien. Et à Pôle emploi, on vous dit “vous pourrez vous débrouiller tout seul”. » Il a sollicité toutes ses connaissances : Bernard Cazeneuve, François Hollande, Michel Sapin, des patrons croisés lors de ses fonctions, comme Louis Gallois. Le 1er mars, il a fini par accepter un poste de salarié chez Tilder, une société de conseil en communication. Un job sous-dimensionné pour celui qui a été maire, député, président de conseil général et vice-président de l’Assemblée nationale, mais il s’estime déjà bien heureux.

Un an après sa défaite, l’écologiste puis socialiste Véronique Massonneau, elle, pointe toujours au chômage. Avant de se lancer en politique, cette ancienne députée de la Vienne était chargée de clientèle à la Caisse d’épargne. Son employeur avait promis de lui proposer un poste en cas de défaite, mais ça n’a pas marché. « Je pensais qu’à la Caisse d’épargne, ils étaient fiers de mon parcours et qu’ils seraient contents de me retrouver, mais j’ai péché par orgueil : j’étais un fardeau, quelqu’un qu’ils n’avaient pas envie de revoir. » A 58 ans, elle sait que ses chances de décrocher un emploi sont minces. Elle continue à chercher, s’occupe de ses petits-enfants, fait la cuisine pour ses amis, jardine.

« Je ne baisse pas les bras, mais il ne faut pas se leurrer : personne n’attend Véronique Massonneau. »",True,False,0,1528048535,,False,0,e01tenn,True,t3_8oaasm,False,t1_e01tdzv,/r/france/comments/8oaasm/après_le_séisme_macron_la_nouvelle_vie_des_déchus/e01tenn/,,1532153255,markdown,18,False,True,False,france,t5_2qhjz,public,

For example, tell one of them there is technology that can stimulate a sexual reaction in a women. Then ask if she wants her daughter to get involved in this wonderful parade for one person. If they do know we have an argument for why the human race really should not go on.

Or we can tell them to bring the children victim's of rape to one of this woman's lectures. I mean, get ready for the future girls and boys, she will be leading the way.

Holy fuck this guy wrote a whole fucking essay on this:

&gt; Nigel, you're pretty ignorant, Sweetie. Sweetie, firstly learn how to use commas, I know it is the invention of ""DA EBIL WHITE MAN"" but all cultures (apart from negros who were too dumb to create a written language) use commas. Okay, now Sweetie, Sweetie you're pretty low IQ if you buy into the theory that negros (who hadn't even created the fucking wheel) creating everything in the fucking world, which is what you are claiming. So let's go through each invention and it's creators: Street lights (I think you mean traffic lights because there was a negro involved in the invention of traffic lights, but there was also a white man involved in it too). Traffic lights are a very simple invention and arguably had a negative impact on society and served only to increase the industrial societies grasp on peoples lives and strip away some of their freedom, kind of ironic that a negro would create such a thing. Anyway, it's inventors were: J. P. Knight (who actually created it)(not black) Garrett Morgan (Negro who made some additions to it)(black) Security systems Okay, yeah. Although that is kind of an necessary invention that I certainly don't have use for, and most people don't have a use for. Most people just have a security camera and a dog, and cameras weren't created by negros
Marie Van Brittan Brown (black) Elevators (not a black man and though there were a lot of people involved in its construction none of them were black) Elisha Graves Otis (not black) Chips. sure, but it was by mistake and not exactly a ground breaking invention. 
George Chum (black) Blood bank Not created by negros, like your seriously allowing blacks to take credit for the inventions of whites, blacks are literally stealing from white people like they do all the fucking time, which is part of the reason people hate them.
Charles Richard Drew (not black) Shoes were not by negros, are you fucking retarded? Shoes have existed for 5000+ years and they weren't created by blacks, they existed first in European and Asian societies, particularly by the Romans and barbarians and the like, but it wasn't a large invention, but not one that was created by blacks. Impossible to know, earliest discovery is 5000 years ago. Cars- Karl Benz created the car, not Asians. I think you just hate white people and want to hand their inventions to everyone else. You're a fucking moron. Video games Created by a German American inventor (Ralph H. Baer) and a lot of video games aren't created by Asians, you're just making shit up again. Bethesda for instance is not located Asia., and I don't use the scrub tier play station, I use a PC like the ubermenschen that I am. phones- I audibly laughed at this, what are you this desperate to take away the achievements of whites that you say Asians created the fucking phone? The inventors of the first phones are: Alexander Graham Bell and Antonio Meucci (not blacks or Asians)
and the inventor of the first mobile phone was Martin Cooper (a fucking white man) and the inventor of touch screen was  Dr. G. Samuel Hurst (a white man) and the inventor of touch screen on phones was IBM (a British company) You are an ill-informed moron, you don't know what you are talking about and don't seem to realize this. The reason blacks commit more crime, are generally poorer, haven't invented much, and in general will always be failures is because they have low IQs, the average IQ of a black man is 85, compared to the white average of 103 and the Asian average of 105.

Disagree. The Euro *has* benefitted southern European countries.

False,aleph_five,,,[],,,,text,"&gt;Às vezes tenho a impressão de que economistas colocam suas visões ideológicas à frente de aspectos técnicos, evitam matemática a todo custo 

É uma discussão interessante, não entendi os downvotes do seu post.

Acho que primeiro talvez exista uma confusão entre o que é economia normativa e economia positiva. Economia positiva se importa com a realidade, o mundo como é. Economia normativa baseia-se em juízos de valores. Por exemplo, maior consumo causa pressões inflacionárias é uma afirmação da economia positiva e pode ser constatada de forma universal. Mas se dissermos que o governo deve executar programas de distribuição de renda ex Bolsa Família, estamos indo para o campo da economia normativa. Aí você pode encontrar as ideologias que você se refere. 

Talvez no Brasil hoje a economia normativa predomine e não exista um debate nos meios de comunicação a respeito da economia positiva. Essa é uma opinião minha, claro. 

Economia usa muito matemática, como tudo nessa vida. Dê uma olhada na equação de Black Scholes ou no modelo de crescimento de Solow, ou em qualquer livro de macroeconomia ou microeconomia. 

O problema é que o campo de estudo da economia envolve, literalmente, milhões de indivíduos e milhares de empresas e firmas, buscando tomar decisões ótimas mas muitas vezes escolhendo de forma contraditória. Não bastasse a complexidade, não agimos de forma de racional. Muitas pessoas preferem comprar um carro novo, quando estariam fazendo melhor poupando. Acionistas podem comprar ações por razões pessoas, crenças não baseadas em fundamentos lógicos. Quantas vezes não compramos coisas que não precisamos? Veja a mania das Tulipas na Holanda no século XVII.

A resposta, eu diria, está que o mundo real é muito mais complexo que um avião para ser modelado de forma apropriada pela economia.

You're about to kill yourself. Your hands can get sliced up a bit. You can also hold a blade without cutting your hands. It's a common thing that has been done throughout the sword using world. The Japanese would do it when committing suicide. The Medieval Europeans did it when halfswording. 

Also, having it in a position is not the same as a suicide attempt. You are just proving my point about the difference between male suicide and female 'suicide'. A suicidal guy I knew had 'positioned' a knife to his heart yet that was no suicide attempt to him nor any of the other guys. Then a few years later he actually cut into his chest a bit.

There's no need to give your post a title, I know what's coming.

&gt; Immigration policy isn't just determined by the EU. 

Do you like, seriously not know anything about how the Schengen area works?

Everything you've mentioned a) was a discussing internally within the EU, none of it includes a single country in the EU, in the Schengen area no less,taking in or retaining more immigrants. 

&gt;You also claim that military and security matters are determined by the EU which is blatantly not true. 

There are some military and security cooperation tied to other organisations (e.g. NATO, InterPol) in which case we don't need Greece to like us. Other security and military cooperation is linked to the EU.

The EU does have a lot of say over who we can interact and cooperate with on lots of issues. Just because I still support Remain even knowing that doesn't make me any of the things you say. You're simply trying to frame the argument in a way that suits you while ignoring real life realities. 

&gt;As for ""a non-insignificant cost"" I honestly don't know where to start. It costs us fuck all to return the marbles and only positives can come out of it.

Firstly there will be a number of tourists that come here to see them and spend money to see them, so giving them away literally cannot have a zero cost even if Greece agreed to pay to have them removed etc.

Secondly it's not all about money, it's about the fact we have a world class exhibit in a museum that was obtained completely legitimately and helps teach our children and citizens about the world outside our borders. There is a significant intangible cost there.

&gt;Oh, and saying that Greece cannot possibly offer us anything in return is a massive insult to the country. Are you so narrow-minded that you can't conceive of a single thing of benefit they might have to offer us?

Since you're failing to mention any too, it may be insulting but the fact remains Greece has nothing to offer the UK. Just like the fact the UK on it's own has very little to offer the US or China that we are willing to trade and hence EU/Trade negotiations are going to be terrible.

False,---moon---,,,[],,,,text,"I'll chime in \- I moved 2500\+ miles away a while back. I had already lived in Europe alone so it didn't seem terrifying, and I moved for a job. I wouldn't call it ""the best decision of my life"" but I'm glad I did it. I have a friend who moved to the opposite coast and said it took her almost ten years to feel ""at home,"" so don't put pressure on yourself to love everything about it right away. I have a great job but the core circle of my family and friends all live three time zones away, and I'm pretty introverted too so it can be tough to meet new people. I can only afford to go home once a year, and there are some nights when I really just wish my best friend could come over and watch TV with me, or the family dog was here for me to snuggle. But in the end, I don't think I would be happier if I had stayed. My friendships *there* didn't happen overnight either \- I didn't even really become close with some of my college friends until we had been in classes together for several years. 

One thing I would always recommend is to not feel ""held back"" because you don't have the same support system or social circle that you did before. You can still go on hikes, go to the beach, go out to eat, etc. even if you don't have a group to go with. There are always books to read and movies to watch and recipes to try. I'm saving up money so I can take some art classes \- I studied some in college and want to get back into it. When you are lonely it's easy to sit around feeling sorry for yourself \(I fall into that cycle all the time\) but you're really the only person who can do anything about your situation. I'm not saying it's easy or that it's awesome all the time, but moving is a good way to start to figure things out for yourself without the safety blanket of being in the place where you grew up. I feel like I've gained a lot of independence, and I've also had to face some aspects of myself that I don't like and I'm working on changing them. Like the commenter above mentioned, you might become someone you never would have been if you had stayed. 

I think it's important to be honest about the experience so people don't feel downtrodden when it's not immediately \~amazing\~ because moving far away doesn't erase all your problems.
