Saudi Arabia does not, but they have the capital. Considering how much Saudi Arabia is trying to brew instability throughout the Middle East by funding ISIS and get a riot starting among the Sunni Iranians, it's not far-fetched. I fail to understand your statement where Iran wouldn't be interested in a war because of potential money and yet claim because of sanctions they aren't profiting much anyway.

Because right now they don't have much too loose. Sanctions can't get much worse anyway. If they wouldn't be sanctioned, they'd be interested into maintaining it open. Why should a country willfully close one of their main sources of money? While I agree with you than Iran will win against Saudi Arabia in most scenarios, it will take a long time and it won't be some quick journey. That isn't to say that proxy wars wouldn't happen.

It's much more likely that will simply help the Houthi's to victory and then proceed from their than risk their economy.

That however needs an economy which would be at risk. If Iran stays sanctioned, they have almost no incentives.

&gt; Trade and a navy are intimately connected. If you are going to trade with countries across oceans. You are going to need a navy. What navy is Germany going to use to protect their maritime exports? No, the EU navy doesn't count because it does not exist nor will there ever will be.

That is the point of arguing for a EU army. You saying ""but it won't happen"" isn't really an argument.

&gt; Aircraft carriers is important because if you want to project military power across the ocean onto land, you need air support. Destroyers are unfit for the job. France, Britain, and even Russia with their shitty carrier knows this.

Ok but how is that relevant to the discussion?

&gt; On China, you are utterly mistaken here. It is disingenuous to claim that the Chinese dynasties are all just Chinese. Each dynasty has their origins in different regions. The Yuan was run by the Mongols. Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty. The Han Chinese were placed at the bottom of the social structure. The Ming Dynasty was the last empire that was run by the Han Chinese, it fell due to a bunch of peasant rebellions, surprise surprise. The Qing Dynasty was run by the Manchus, not the Han. The dynastic cycle has always plagued China and the PRC just happens to be the latest one which happens to only exist because of the Americans. The thing to take away from is that all of these dynasties never projected power outside of its own neighborhood and never will.

Sure, but those dynasties are still considered China, whether you like it or not. You creating some arbitrary reasons of ""oh but the ruling class wasn't Han Chinese"" is just that, arbitrary.

Whether Han or non-Han ruling class, what is now China, was unified for many centuries. I'm not sure how the ethnicity of the ruling class changes that what is now China was unified for a long time with relatively few upheaval moments.

Actually the dynastic cycle helped to maintain Chinese unity, because the conquerors always relied on the legitimacy of said cycle.

&gt; But please, continue being delusional and hostile.

I'm not hostile. You simply make quite wild statements which can be looked up quite quickly to see it is mostly wrong.

&gt; Don't hesitate to return back to Wikipedia and quote every single part of my response because of your inability to create a rebuttal into a more formal structure.

Weird way to criticize somebody. Me using wikipedia to get the dates right should be a bad thing? Or me checking wikipedia about how much an economy relies on trade? (apparently 20% export to GDP ratio means total reliance while a 12% ratio means no reliance at all)

U.S farm subsidies are moot in regards to making your argument true.

&gt;And the entire country since it's an industry that exists and produces tax revenue and would likely not exist at all without the aid of tariffs, at least dairy. Again, get rid of supply management if you want, but the tariffs need to stay so long as the U.S subsidizes dairy production.

Again no they, don't. There's no benefit to using tariffs in response to subsidy dumping. It only serves as a tax on Canadians consumers and hurts Canadians. To quote Milton Friedman on Subsidy dumping (only instead in the context of Japanese steel dumping) [There's this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_FXt0eM&amp;t=) The consensus shown here is shared among the mainstream of the profession and proving by overwhelming statistical and empirical evidence.  There's literally no difference between Krugman or Friedman or Keynes on this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

You're not benefiting the average Canadian or domestic industry as a whole by using tariffs to prevent subsidy dumping. You're hurting Canadians consumers in retaliation for the American's sending us free money. It's not the government's business to tell consumers what to buy. If America chooses to waste taxpayer money subsidy dumping Canada, we benefit from that no the Untied States because American Taxpayer money is being siphoned into Canada. Additionally, it's not American subsidy dumpers who decide if Canadian dairy survives or not. it's Canadian consumers. If Canadian consumers prefer cheaper American milk over Canadian milk, that's their business, not anyone else. In any case, it's not a viable or sustainable long term policy for the U.S to subsidy dump Canada to attempt to create an American milk monopoly there. Full stop, Canada is significantly better off without any protectionist policies in it's agricultural sector. Agricultural protectionism for the sake of self sufficiency is one of the most misguided, unsubstantiated arguments in Economic history with centuries of evidence to validate that fact.

There's no objective benefit for the country as a whole to continue these policies or replace them with tariffs. It hurts too many people and helps too few.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I never said anything to contradict that. I said that getting rid of tariffs on dairy is a terrible idea.

That's the problem though. We shouldn't let fear mongering and misguided public perceptions distract from the overwhelming evidence in contradiction to those views. There's far more evidence to suggest that removing agricultural protectionism is the way to go rather than sustaining those policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is more and more true every day. We can't have foreign companies eavesdropping and putting backdoors into Canadian telecommunications. This is the whole issue with Huawei 5G for example

By your own logic,  nearly every other developed country in the world is ridiculously more vulnerable to sabotage that Canada because it keeps it's telecom sectors more globalized. In reality, it has no bearing on our local intelligence agencies ability to do it's job. If Huwaei still an intelligence threat, they'll be treated as such regardless of how liberalized the Canadian  telecom sector is.  That doesn't change under liberalization and I'm not sure why you think it would.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of the foreign telecom companies have anything even approaching a majority stake in Finnish telecom. Canada similarly allows small shares of the telecom industry to be owned by foreign companies, we don't allow foreign companies to own large portions of it. If we just deregulated, Shaw, Bell and Rogers would be eaten up by large multinationals within months, no question. This is unacceptable and a threat to national security.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, that's in complete contradiction to the evidence regarding telecom liberalization. Liberalization equals higher rates of competition and the dismantling of existing monopolies and oligopolies. To argue that Shaw Bell and Rogers would just be eaten up and replaced by foreign oligopolies in the event of liberalization is unsubstantiated. Without government support, telecom monopolies oligopolies cannot sustain themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, let's look at Singapore's telecom liberalization in the 90s and 2000s. Singapore not only exists in a much closer proximity to a country like China, but is one of the most (if not the most) liberalized telecom sectors in the globe. The result of their liberalization policy (as with every other full scale telecom liberalization in a developed country) was reduced oligopoly power, more consumer choice and better services at lower prices.  Likewise, the same liberalization reforms were enacted in Australia far more recently and what you've speculated would happens did not happen. There's more competition, oligopolies have been broken up and [Australian telecom prices are considerably more affordable than Canada's.](https://www.aldimobile.com.au/plans/mobile-plans/) (it's worth mentioning that Australian dollars are basically the same value as Canadian. [A 10GB plan in Canada is $75 CAD a month for Rodgers and around $85 for 20GB](https://www.rogers.com/consumer/wireless/smartphone-plans#financingTabPlan). In contrast An 18GB a month Australian plan is around $25 AU a month. You can't gauge telecom prices the way you can in Canada without the government creating regulatory barriers to entry to prevent competition).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EU states operate as a nation in many respects and most of the ""foreign"" telecom businesses in the EU are from the EU.

Again, that's a very moot point designed to defend poorly reasoned protectionist policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;to suggest that countries like Ireland, Romania or the U.K got rid of a nationalized system because it didn't work well, rather than because the politics of the time demanded it is disingenuous.

That's fairly disingenuous reasoning on it's own. It's also ignoring that all of those countries saw improvements in quality and affordability after privatization and liberalization.  Those reforms were enacted because liberalization was objectively superior to what they had before. As it is the case of Canada, today, now, or in Australia, or in Singapore, or in Hong Kong or in any other developed country or jurisdiction etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean look as Sasktel right here in Canada. They are able to outcompete national carriers on price and have caused Saskatchewan to have the lowest cost mobile plans in the country. It's not fucking rocket science here. This is a uility. We should treat it like one.

&amp;#x200B;

Saskel essentially acts as another large teleco in Saskatchewan and improves prices through market competition. It's a case in favor for market liberalzation, not nationalization.

Your first airsoft gun is the most important purchase you will make in airsoft. As your only weapon it must be **versatile**, **reliable**, **affordable**, reasonably high-performance, easy to work on, and compatible with as many accessories and upgrades as possible. This means buying an Automatic Electric Gun ('AEG') assault rifle or Sub-Machine Gun ('SMG'); **forget about sniper rifles, pistols, gas guns and other restrictive exotica** until you have more money, more experience, and at least one backup weapon.

System Component | Comment
---|---
Primary Weapon | An AEG assault rifle or SMG.
Magazine | A high-capacity ('hi-cap') magazine can replace numerous medium-capacity ('mid-cap') magazines, and many AEGs are supplied with one. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'.
Battery | You should have at least two. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'.
Battery Charger | You may also need a battery tester/balancer.

Again, most airsoft sites will rent you a weapons system, so you don't need to purchase your own until you're ready to commit to airsoft.

Which model of airsoft gun you purchase depends, in decreasing order of importance, on your **budget**, your **location**, and your **preference**. It is important that you understand that small budgets force you to choose from the small range of affordable guns that are not absolutely terrible. We will always recommend that you purchase the best gun that your budget will allow, rather than the cheapest gun that you can get away with: in airsoft, you get what you pay for. Good intermediate guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than budget or beginner alternatives. Your location may impose rules, or affect pricing, in a way that makes one gun better than the other. Your preference will be the choice between the guns that best fit your budget and location.

Commonly recommended choices include:

Make &amp; Model | Approximate Price | Comment
---|---|----
CYMA TM-Clone AK | $100 | CYMA's CM028 and CM028S are clones of the original TM AK-47 and AKS-47, and include a hi-cap magazine. These are the cheapest AEG we recommend, and are generally considered reliable, upgradeable, and reasonably versatile. However, their all-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ('ABS') plastic construction makes them relatively fragile. For improved robustness we strongly recommend spending slightly more to purchase a Glass-Filled Nylon Polymer ('GFP') AR-15 or a steel AK. To see a loadout built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot budget loadout'.
CYMA VFC-Clone AK | $150+ | CYMA's VFC-clone AKs are generally considered reliable, reasonably robust, and good value for money. AKs are generally tougher than AR-pattern alternatives. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an LCT or E&amp;L AK. For more information on loadouts built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot noob ak loadout'.
G&amp;G [Combat Machine AR-15](http://guay2.com/en/product-3-15-14-1) | $140+ | G&amp;G's CM16s are the gold standard of beginner airsoft guns. Built from a surprisingly tough GFP, CM16s are reliable, affordable, accessible and therefore absolutely ubiquitous. If possible, purchase one without G&amp;G's somewhat unreliable electronic trigger control system. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Classic Army Polymer AR-15 | $185+ | Classic Army's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to a slightly upmarket version of G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Tippman Commando | $160+ | Tippman's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Apex Fast Attack | $125+ | OEM'd by Classic Army, Apex's Fast Attack AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. Versions with GFP and metal receivers are available. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
ICS [CS4 Sportline](http://www.icsbb.com/product-category/electric-gun/electric-gun-cs4/electric-gun-cs4-sport/) | $190+ | ICS' Sportline AR-15s are effectively a re-shell of their excellent regular guns in a GFP receiver. They retain the convenient split gearbox system of the regular guns. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an ICS AR-15.
Specna Arms CORE | $130+ | Largely restricted to the European market, Specna Arms' CORE series of GFP AR-15s are considered to be reliable, robust, and good value for money. Many players now recommend these over CM16s, to which they are roughly equivalent. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a Specna Arms AR-15.

**FAQs:**

1. **What's the next step?** If you're new to airsoft and haven't already, reply '**airsoftbot how do I start**'. In the FAQ at the bottom of that reply is a series of steps that will guide you further.

2. **I can't afford any of the guns listed. Now what?** Reply 'airsoftbot what does it cost'.

3. **I've got more to spend than any of the guns listed cost. Now what?** In order to lower the cost of entry to airsoft, the guns recommended above prioritise a low purchase price. Good intermediate and high-end guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than the guns recommended above. Intermediate alternatives are listed alongside the beginner models recommended above, but the massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

4. **What else do I need?** Your gun is only one part of a weapons system, and will require batteries, a battery charger and potentially a battery tester/balancer, and ammunition. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'. If you can afford them, you should also purchase more magazines and potentially a speedloader. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'. The purchase of more magazines usually necessitates the purchase of gear which enables you to carry them, and a sling. You may also wish to purchase weapon accessories such as optical sights and lights. For more information on some recommended weapons systems, reply 'airsoftbot loadouts'. The massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

And when I need a new hip I’ll just wait twice as long or more to get it. 25% of cancer patients in the UK started treatment late. It won’t cost me a thing I just might die waiting on it.

Lol - it’s 3.5% more taxes which on the median income of 60k USD means you would pay 2100$ for healthcare Including dental, and so on. Per year. For your whole family. No deductible, no co pay. No questions asked.

The average in the US is somewhere between 4500 and 8500$ per Year. And then you still have to deal with an industry which tries to kill you since your health endangers their bottom line. 

&gt;	And when I need a new hip I’ll just wait twice as long or more to get it. 

My mum got new hips last two years. Got her first appointment within 3 months of the referral - the second one, one year later mainly cause she wanted to go on holidays in between. 

After her surgery they send her on rehab - at no extra cost besides food. 

If that’s so bad - I can live with it. 

&gt;	25% of cancer patients in the UK started treatment late. It won’t cost me a thing I just might die waiting on it.

And 35% of Americans are under insured (meaning they probably won’t end treatment or in bankruptcy) or have no insurance - meaning they will just die. 

Much improvement

But then this is the NHS - which has been slowly starved by tories who want nothing more then a privatized health care system and are dismantling the NHS wherever they can. 

&gt;	More time off work? The average worker in the United States earns more than the average worker in Austria because of our hard work. Yet again different values.

No you don’t. You have to pay more for housing, healthcare, childcare, education and numerous other things that are taken care of here. 

Again - the average American now needs to work 53 weeks to fulfill basic needs per year - which is as you might have noticed - impossible 

And even if you would have more disposable income. What good is it if you can’t enjoy it. Weirdly all Americans who I know (and it’s a bunch due to my job) seem to enjoy living in Austria more then I the US.

&gt;	Most Americans don’t want a nanny state and the high tax rates needed to pay for these programs.

Most Americans things that those programs are some form of communism and that they are better off paying more for shitty for profit healthcare then less for universal socialized one. 

It’s brainwashing - and your industry is amazing at it and it works as I can see in your case quite well. 

But in the end it’s an easy equation - look what you or your employer pays for healthcare - calculate 3.5% of your gross income and then see who pays more. Add deductibles and co pays. See who gets the better deal. 

I know you will say “I do” but we both know it’s not true right ? 

&gt;	If we did we’d vote for them but you don’t see that happening. It’s like you can’t understand people may value didn’t things than you do.


And how would you vote for it ?

You have no choice (well you had no choice - you might get some choice now).
But so far the choice was either corporate democrat who will not touch the system cause it finances his / her campaigns or even more corporate republican who isn’t even lying about making the system better and just wants people off any social security program. 


&gt;	So no, it’s not some shithole. You can look to Iran or Somalia for that.

Again your are trying to create a comparison with countries that are way less developed and have way less material wealth then any comparable nation. 

It’s a completely useless comparison. 

Compare yourself with the quality of life in Western Europe, in Japan, in well - developed nations and not countries that are on the bottom rung of that.

Afinal, fatos são fatos, não tem muito o que conversar ou discutir a respeito deles a não ser que desenvolva para opiniões. No mínimo, a pessoa precisa ter uma opinião sobre o fato (achar o fato interessante, por exemplo), pra conversa seguir em frente. 

Mentiras puras também não formam uma boa base para conversas.

Sobram as opiniões mesmo. As opiniões são a principal base da comunicação humana. Conversar sem dar opinião nenhuma é quase impossível.

[],,BillionDollaWhale,,,,,,,t2_5kzidtyt,[],"Go read up on the 1MDB scandal.  It is one of, if not the biggest, frauds in the history of the world.  Billions upon billions of dollars were stolen from the Malaysian wealth fund to pay for things like the filming of the Wolf of Wall Street, towards very famous rappers and R and B singers, millions towards movie posters, millions for excessive gambling etc. etc.  It brought down the prime minster of Malaysia because his wife would spend millions of dollars on jewelry and on things like Hermes bags.  Believe me, you haven't seen excessive consumption until you've seen some of the pieces of jewelry in Rosmah Mansor's collection....she has one friggin necklace with a massive top quality diamond that's worth over $25,000,000.  And that's only the beginning.  Once the scandal broke out, the PM and Rosmah fell from grace and the police confiscated everything.  They had to have something like five *truckloads* carry off all of the Hermes bags and diamond jewelry from Rosmah's collection.  And we aren't talking about POS pieces....alll were the top grade diamonds possible.  

But that's only the tip of the iceberg of the 1MDB scandal.  You should read up how it was all able to be done with a vast, vast network of political corruption, dark lobbying money, and secret offshore bank accounts.  At one point, the scam artists behind 1MDB were able to infiltrate Obama's White House, and the person they had a connection with enriched himself with $10 million dollars of stolen 1MDB money + used money to fund gubernatorial and senate races for the Democrats.  The FBI is currently investigating this, and has even seized proceeds from films like Daddy's Home and Wolf of Wall Street.  

The conspiracy theory related to this takes a dark turn.  Media in Malaysia who tried to report on this were intimidated, and one reporter was murdered.  It is not out of the question at all that the globes elite who benefited from stealing billions of dollars from the poor and middle class in Malaysia wanted the reporter shut up.  He was found in a barrel at the bottom of some water (can't remember his name at the moment).  The whole story involves exclusive celebrities and real estate in the US, billionaire sheiks in the middle east, corrupt politicians all over asia, and shady banking in europe and the cayman islands.  You can't make this shit up.  

Go look up the 1MDB scandal and even on the US justice department's website for keywords like '1MDB' and 'Jho Low' (the main suspect).  It is insane!  That cocksucker needs to be brought to justice yet he continues to game the whole world system by paying off corrupt autocrats and finding loophole after loophole in the world's banking systems. Jho Low himself was also recently able to sue publishers in the UK from printing a book related to this scandal that outed him, showing you the lengths to which this asshole will try to suppress free speech and coverage of the scandal.  It also recently came to light that the Thai junta helped Jho Low arrest key figures who were about to whistle blow while they were traveling through Thailand.  The whole thing is corruption on a massive scale, and the Malaysian commoners paid for it dearly (their economy and currency has since tanked after the 1 MDB fund became insolvent after billions had been pilfered from it).",True,False,False,,,0,1583041707,,1583043045,0,{},fj5sm0q,False,t3_fbiay6,False,True,t3_fbiay6,/r/AskReddit/comments/fbiay6/what_conspiracy_theories_do_you_think_are_too/fj5sm0q/,False,,1590942177,3,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

We know it sucks, as we were looking forward to seeing you all, but hold on to your tickets we’ll be announcing the new dates very soon,” Green Day said in a statement on its official website.
The move followed the decision by South Korean boy band BTS - the biggest K-POP band in the world - to cancel four concerts in Seoul’s Olympic stadium in April that were due to kick off its latest world tour, citing concerns over coronavirus.
BTS, whose new album “Map of the Soul:7” topped charts in Germany, France and Britain on Friday and is expected to do the same in America, has spent the past several weeks in the United States, where they recorded a performance at New York’s Grand Central Station and appeared on “Carpool Karaoke” with late night TV host James Corden.
BTS is currently still scheduled to perform several dates in California in late April.Last week, British rapper Stormzy and American R&amp;B singer Khalid also postponed all the Asian concerts on their tours from late March to mid April that would have taken them to cities including Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul.

Not sure what this means, but Turkish losses are almost always to jet strikes or artillery. I think the 2020 losses were 25 before the big attack, and about 60 afterwards, officially.

As for the war itself, Assad has all but won I'd say. He united most of Syria but at what cost? Economy ruined, half the population hates him, cities devastated three times over. Syria is on the verge of being a Russian puppet state at this point, because they are completely dependent on Russia to stop Turkish advances.

Kurds ended up in a surprisingly okay position even though US sort of sold them out to Turkey. Expect it's obvious that US hasn't sold the Kurds fully because you can see the Turkish capabilities against Syria right now. Turkey did not attack the Syrian Kurds with nearly as much power as they are attacking the Syrian regime now. Clearly US used diplomatic means to slow down and temper Turkey's actions against the SDF / YPG.

ISIS is practically disbanded and is no longer a threat to any state. But individual attacks still might happen in Europe, Turkey and Syria.

Turkey has failed in her long term strategic objectives in regards to Syria. Now Turkey has to commit it's army just to keep the small number of poorly trained rebels alive. Turkey is hosting 3 million plus refugees and if Idlib falls, that number will grow. Erdogan has ruined relations with just about every nation on the planet.

If people are staying home and factories stall because of that, its not something you can compensate for with free money.

As for GDP; you distort the data by picking the financial crisis as your reference point. The UK was impacted far more by that crisis than countries like germany or france or even southern countries.  If you where to pick your benchmark date **before** the crisis, you would see a very different picture, one where the UK is lagging most of the eurozone.

Humans need vitamin D to remain healthy. One way to generate vitamin D is light. When humans started to leave Africa and moved into the north where there was much less sunlight, the ones with a lighter skin had better chances of survival. After many generations everybody became white. (Being white in a place with lots of light is a disadvantage as this increases the risk for skin cancer.) Sure there are some other minor differences.
About the oppressing: all humans are pretty good at treating other people like shit; when one race is ""on top"" or when the other,  depends on the circumstances of the time. All races had slaves at one time or another, or did other horrible things to others.
What you are getting at is probably the slave issue in the US; no doubt a horrendous situation. Africans sold their enemies to Europeans, who stacked them like logs in ships and sold them to Americans who used them as slaves. To justify that to themselves, they had to dehumanize the Africans (oldest trick in the book) and could do this with the Bible in the hand. 
Slavery is long over, but this artificial division still lingers on. And it will linger on longer as, white people need to acknowledge the shit some of their ancestors have done, but black people need to stop blaming everything on discrimination; that doesn't help either; maybe you didn't get that job only because you were less qualified instead of a racist employer?
When this race nonsense finally will be over, the color of your skin should mean the same as a hair color, or the color of your eyes. Something pretty irrelevant. No worries though, if that ever happens, we humans will have something else to divide ourselves in: political view, religion, sexual preference, the nation you live in, the language you speak, you name it.

For the record; I'm a white European, my ancestors were all poor and had to struggle to survive. I don't care about the color of your skin, I rather mind how someone behaves. I actually don't feel very comfortable with African Americans out of fear I say or do something that might offends them. I don't have this with black people from other nations. Some of my colleagues got in trouble for saying or doing things in front of African Americans they would say or do to everybody.

Did you reference a topographic map to see if the landscape would allow for the rail line to go through there? Are you basing parts of it off the current (refurbished) railway?

I've often thought that an entirely new line should be made which follows the Trakia highway more or less in parallel. The current Burgas-Sofia line was, and still is being reworked to allow the Burgas-Skopje rail connection. It's an EU-funded project which should finish by 2025 if I recall correctly. It also had a budget of roughly 350 million euro, so that puts things into perspective, compared to the 16/20 billion you're estimating.

Also, by high-speed, it's usually implied that the average speed would be in the 180-200 km/h range, with the sole concept of connecting only the biggest, most important cities as fast as possible. So I don't think having the train stop at Yambol or Pazardjik would make sense.

Otherwise we definitely need a big improvement on our East to West connection. I recently had to travel by public transport both from Burgas to Sofia and from Burgas to Plovdiv. In both cases I chose the bus and frankly BS-SF took 4h30m and BS-PD also took 4h30m but that's because fucking Union Shittony stops everywhere and doesn't even drive as fast as he is legally allowed.

Anyway, we need a faster way to connect to the capital. close to 5 hours by bus and 7+ by train for a measly ~380km is ridiculous (even given the topology).",True,False,False,,,0,1583053208,,False,0,{},fj62b92,False,t3_fbr2os,False,False,t3_fbr2os,/r/bulgaria/comments/fbr2os/i_made_a_concept_map_of_how_a_high_speed_rail/fj62b92/,False,,1590946806,9,True,False,bulgaria,t5_2qhx7,r/bulgaria,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

&gt;Game looks cool and i have few questions
&gt;
&gt;Does it matter if i use the launcher or steam version? Because steam complete edition is cheaper compred to the one in sqaure website?

Yes, it matters. Despite it being cheaper at the moment on steam, most people still would not recommend getting the Steam version. You will have to buy the Steam version of all expansions in the future. You cannot mix-and-match licenses (i.e. buy from SE store, amazon, gmg, etc) if you get a Steam license. You also must open the game through Steam  now.

&gt;What will i get from the complete edition in terms of ingame comtent? I see some races and classes not abailable to me because its locked?

You'll get the base game, and Shadowbringers, which will include all previous expansions. With this, you unlock 3 races, and can get 7 classes. However, 3 classes require a level 50+ char and must have completed the story up to Heavenward to unlock. They also start at level 30, not 50. The other classes start at 50 or 60.

&gt;Which eu realm is better to join?
&gt;I heard some servers got the exp buff(until lvl70) and players say the buff is great but i will out level most quests because of it so i need a realm without this buff?

Don't worry about having the buff or not. Yes, you will probably over-level pretty early, but you still get synced down in dungeons or some special quests. It's still more beneficial to have that buff than not.

As for specific server, I'm NA, so I can't recommend.

&gt;I can decide on a starting class-sadly the only one handed sword class is samurai which is locked until lvl 50 -/- does it mean i need to open a random class and then change it to samurai at lvl 50? I also wanted to try Bard/Archer but they say its one of the weakest for raids and other content.. so i'm not sure what to do.. maybe dragoon! But they use spears and not 1handed swords

Yes, you'll need to start as another class before you can play Samurai. SAM can be unlocked at level 50.

As for Bard, just because it doesn't produce the highest dps doesn't mean it's ""weak for raids"". Raid parties are generally balanced to have 2 tanks, 2 healers, 1 melee, 1 physical ranged, 1 magic ranged, and 1 other dps (melee or ranged). Bard is phys ranged, and provides a somewhat-passive damage buff support for the team. Although they are one the low end compared with the 10 dps classes, they are still very common in groups. The game is very balanced for group compositions.

If you want to play SAM, I suggest either LNC/DRG, or ROG/NIN. You can unlock Rogue at level 10, and I think it would play a *little* more like SAM than DRG would, mostly in terms of speed. You could also pick PUG/MNK, as the two classes share gear.

And please cite me a source saying that Muslims killed 500 million Hindus, considering India’s population never even reached close to that under Mughal rule, a time notable for being an economic golden age. Further the Mughals ruled with the support of Hindu leaders and delegated much of the local administration to them.

Finally there is a relationship between poverty and reactionary beliefs, in the US where the average Muslim is better off than in most of the world they are more likely to support gay rights than the average evangelical Christian. 

But outside of all that it’s also the case that leftists largely support secularism as opposed to any religion, or even state atheism. Leftists support Muslims in India because they are a minority oppressed for their religion, something that is as intrinsic to the individual as their culture. Look at how the Indian government burned down a shanty town because the people couldn’t produce papers and were presumed to be Muslims, the people that lost their homes were in fact working class Hindus who couldn’t afford papers. We don’t support any religion more so than another, we oppose oppression on the basis of religion and Muslims are a widely oppressed minority, pretty different from how you’re interpreting our position.",True,False,False,,,0,1583060319,,False,0,{},fj67a5t,False,t3_fbruzq,False,True,t3_fbruzq,/r/DebateCommunism/comments/fbruzq/why_does_the_left_support_islam_in_india/fj67a5t/,False,,1590949171,3,True,False,DebateCommunism,t5_2vkao,r/DebateCommunism,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

That's not what I was arguing. My argument was that ""permanent"" residents (I'm using the word permanent a bit liberally here) should be the only ones entitled to welfare, otherwise this opens the door to so much more abuse of welfare systems.  
  
I'll take Finland as an example for simplicity: citizens, refugees, third country nationals living with their spouses, third country nationals with a permanent residence permit, ... all those people are in Finland on some basis that is not economic, therefore they're entitled to welfare should they need it.

The distinction between ""caste"" and ""people"" badly reflects that dualism, since neither the winners are from the right nor the losers from the left; On the contrary, we have jumped from a logic of classes (materialist) to a logic of identities and values ​​(postmaterialist). Among the winners there are not a few successful young professionals or entrepreneurs, in dynamic economic sectors, along with large, medium (and even small) companies, which have launched (successfully) into the global market. They are enlightened, urban, and many vote for ""progressive"" formations, what Piketty calls the gauche brahmane (the new ""caste""). And there are also many types of losers: they can be Aymara in Bolivia or manual workers of the United States rust belt. Or they may be an old civil servant middle class or Spanish farmers and ranchers, fed up with the ""progre"" culture of urban students that stigmatizes bulls, hunting or Holy Week processions and belittles and ignores the rural. Paradoxically, the illiberal is often a demand for freedom, since this new ""populism"" is, in large measure, a counter-cultural reaction, especially acute where the moral transition to a permissive and postmaterialist society has been more abrupt (it is the case of Spain), generating deep intergenerational and sectoral differences. Thus, this anticosmopolitan and renaissance reaction can jump both on the left (in Greece, in Chile), and on the right (in France, Germany, Poland, USA, Spain), although both seek the protection of the State and old borders. Kirchner or Corbyn (or Pablo Iglesias) are not that far from Le Pen, Orbán or Salvini (or Abascal).

By the way, emigration is, more than cause, scapegoat for this renaissance, because again there is little correlation (macro) between foreign presence and xenophobia (eye: not in small cities). Neonationalism has more support in the interior of the United Kingdom than in London, in the American Middle West than on the coasts, in rural Lepenist France than in the cities, in the Ampurdán than in Barcelona.

But to understand the intensity and generality of the revolts it is inevitable to mention a couple of technological variables that are radically changing the agora of politics.

First, the Internet, which allows the transfer and dissemination of cutting-edge technologies in the organization of revolts, from how to engineer a Molotov cocktail to how to deal with the police. Previously, local learning was necessary; Today, just go to the web (deep or superficial) to find all kinds of manuals. A global learning for global revolts, which mimic. With few consequences for the rioters, by the way, as hyper-guarantee legal systems shield them from any negative consequences. The revolt is made at zero cost.

But even more important are social networks, with global penetration rates above 60%. Well, if something had to be invented to organize riots, we would invent social networks, and nothing that happens would have the intensity it has without them. Fantastic mechanisms to organize protests, prepare them, summon them and manage them during the same development, and that allow to add all kinds of discontent and “outraged”, frequently for different, even opposing causes. They are ""moved"" (hirak, in Arabic), sometimes even performances or flashmobs, without clear leadership and without the slightest intention of transforming even into pressure groups. But here it is that the same social networks are totally inadequate spaces for debate and dialogue, unable to generate agreements and consensus. On the contrary, they facilitate insult, aggression (again free of charge, without cost) or lies, fake news, polarizing audiences that take refuge in their opinion bubbles. Almost at the antipodes of a Hamasmasian ideal dialogue situation. There is no space (no room) in that space to move from protest to proposal.

7)

So the new communication technologies have facilitated the protest, but, at the same time, they have hindered the proposal. But what about the possible political responses? Couldn't these accommodate the demands? Here we find the second big problem, because we have to add another consequence of globalization, perhaps the most important one and the one that undoubtedly endangers representative democracies. I allude to the fact that more and more problems are already global, transnational, and can only be addressed globally or, at least, in large political spaces (such as the EU or large countries: China, USA). The economy, of course, is already global (even more so in open and exporting economies), such as climate, emigration, security and terrorism, finances, crime, even diseases and pandemics, such as the current one. of the coronavirus. And I could go on. But the architecture of politics remains based on states that are sovereign in their territory, but incompetent beyond. And so, as globalization progresses and we leave the classic Westphalian world behind (we are out of state), a growing hiatus opens up between the needs of world governance to generate public goods and the territorialized architecture of politics. I suspect that the great problem of the 21st century is not that there are problems, there always are; is that we do not have global governance instruments to manage them.

**The big problem of the 21st century is not that there are problems, but that we have no instruments of global governance**

The consequence is that states cannot cope with the demands of the population. If the basis of democracy is ""accountability"", it has jumped to a higher level, where it finds no interlocutors. That is why the European Union is so important, because it is the mechanism to deal with these global problems. But the paradox is that the EU is not (at all) a democracy, so we have (simplifying) democracies without the ability to respond and the ability to respond without democracy - and the same could be said of the UN, which is also not a democracy , and that has invented the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to generate a certain global governance.

**And hence also the urgency for the EU to truly become a United States of Europe, which can democratically manage the problems of European citizens.**

So they are times of ""outraged"" mobilized and well organized, but of governments divided and disorganized. Times in which it is easy to organize the protest, but difficult and slow to prepare the response. We had invented social mediation systems; parties, trade unions, business organizations and collective bargaining should add discomfort and find ways of solution. But the parties represent the globalized, and the unions, the public sector; both lack credibility, many companies have denationalized (paradoxically: that's why they support separatism in Catalonia) and the state lacks levers. It is not surprising that national policy becomes symbolic and expressive, of ""posturing"" (low cost), since identities and ""narratives"" can be managed locally (even in Teruel).

“Constructivist” and performative policy, which believes that the world can change by changing the language, while instrumental (non-expressive) policy jumps from level and is decided in the EU or in global networks and markets. When we talk about the need for a new social contract, we must think about it in economic and cultural terms. Times of change, of course. Global changes, huge, because the rise of China, India and other giants can not cause seizures, particularly in Europe, which was 25% of the world population a century ago and today is 7% (while Asia is 60 %). Neowestfaliano world but poseuropeo and, to a large extent, even post-western. But changes that, in the end, are manifested locally, ""glocal"" changes. We have no choice but to face them and it will not be an easy or fast task. In any case, when we talk about the need for a new social contract that sutures dualization, I suspect that we should not only think about it in economic terms, but also in cultural terms. Nothing forces us to be the first of the class in postmaterialism.

As always, you have to listen more, and not just talk, do more political pedagogy, but give citizens less lessons.

De novo, essa retranca do time da casa é uma lenda urbana de quem não para pra analizar as partidas de futebol. Na verdade não existe retranca do time da casa na partida de ida, porque este *precisa* partir pra cima e conseguir o resultado. Se contentar com 0x0 é pedir pra ser eliminado.

&gt; E em torneios com jogos de ida e volta, ambos os times tem a chance de jogar em casa.

E daí? O que isso tem a ver?

&gt; O mandante, por outro lado, não pode nem sonhar em levar gol. Qualquer gol que ele tome pode significar a sua eliminação, ainda que vença o jogo. 

Tautologias que são verdadeiras tanto pra regra gf quanto pra mata-matas sem a regra gf.

&gt; Ele precisa evitar levar gol. E isso é mais importante do que abrir o placar.

Óbvio que não. O mais importante é, e sempre vai ser, vencer fora. Claro que é mais importante evitar levar gol com regra gf do que sem regra gf. Mas um time pode tranquilamente se classificar ganhando de 2x1 e empatando em 0x0, ou ganhando de 4x1 e perdendo de 2x0, como o Galo fez contra o teu time em 2014.

&gt; Em um jogo de ida, 0x0 é um placar excelente para o mandante, pois na volta ele poderá empatar por qualquer placar que não seja 0x0 que ele passa direto. Outro 0x0 e o jogo vai pros pênaltis.

Tu só pode tar morando no mundo da lua pra falar uma coisa dessas.

Eu não vou negar que 0x0 é vantajoso pro mandante. Talvez seja, talvez não. Mas passa longe de ser ""excelente"". Na verdade 0x0 com gf é o placar mais neutro que existe no futebol (quer dizer que não dá uma vantagem significativa pra nenhum dos times). É fácil demonstrar isso. Cria uma thread agora, ""0x0 em jogo de ida com gol qualificado beneficia o mandante ou o visitante""? Tu vai ver que muita gente vai dizer que beneficia o mandante, muita gente vai dizer que beneficia o visitante, e não existe consenso.

Tambem depende do time. 0x0 no Beira-Rio no jogo de ida é horroroso pro Inter. 0x0 na Arena ou no Maracanã no jogo de ida é decente pro Grêmio ou pro Flamengo.

&gt; Mas se o placar agregado fosse o principal critério de classificação, ele poderia ter razão em preferir um empate de 0x0 em casa a uma vitória de 2x1.

Yes I did and my source is from a person involved with the Greece-EU negotiations from the period. So I would say I have filled the blanks pretty well.

&gt; They are helping by taking those immigrants

See this is where you don't understand how borders/nations work. Germany is part of Schengen this means free movement which means that if Germany accepts someone in then they can go to other Schengen countries which means that decisions of Germany affect other EU nations. And if Germany invites in ton of people who are a strain on welfare systems and a security risk. Then they are hurting the other EU countries as well. Same thing happens when Greece lets in migrants also. 

This is where EU countries should get together and work together instead of irresponsibly letting in migrants. And countries not being able to secure their borders should be hold responsible for that whether its failing to stop migrants or inviting them in. If unable to do this then Schengen free movement must be broken down.

So housing migrants is not helping its the opposite of helping here.

&gt; Dude this isn't the USSR, no you arn't allowed to just shot people who cross the border.

I would absolutely agree. First you must inform them they don't have permission to enter the country and to turn around if they refuse fire a warning shot and only after that shoot them.

I have no idea where you are getting mass executions from. WTH is wrong with you. What on earth have WW2 and SS got to do with this??

&gt; Now you are just throwing everything on a pile and see if it makes sense. (no it doesn't).

What part of it doesn't make sense please go into detail on what/why?

&gt; This has nothing to do with an EU monster state.

It shouldn't, yet EU keeps making it harder/impossible for nations to police their borders again see their reactions to Hungary actually setting up border security. This is the problem and without EU this problem wouldn't exist.

It really makes me sad that in the USA, which claims to be a developed nation, it isn’t crystal clear why something like sick leave is invaluable.

Couple reasons right off the bat:

1) One thing that doesn’t occur here in Europe and did at workplaces in the USA and military bases overseas, is these “bugs” that sweep through an entire office. Not to say there isn’t a flu season here, but when people are sick we do not have a culture of distrust and force sick people into the office. We send them home to get better. 

And if we do feel like they are feigning illness, no one here can claim they cannot afford a doctor so we tend not to have many malingerers.

2) Secondly, and maybe more importantly, we want our people to get better so they can come back to work and be productive. I guess in a low-wage society like the USA there is perhaps less of a need to protect people with fewer skills and less education, but we wouldn’t think of abandoning employees that we have invested so much in, and who are vested in us. Except for unskilled labour jobs, if you are firing people after a week or two of being ill then you didn’t have the right people to begin with (btw, I’m not suggesting unskilled workers should be fired quickly either, but simply that USA companies are not hiring good employees if they feel compelled to abandon them so quickly).

They were always neo-liberal and started privatising everything, but they also fixed the crippled economy and improved life standards. Erdogan was quite in favour of Western values up until around 2011 - talks with the EU was going so good that many were hopeful we would be in the EU in a few years. They were religious and weren't hiding it (and were allied with the fundamentalist religious organisation which they had a conflict of interest with in 2013 and which was behind the coup attempt of 2016) but seemed to conduct it in a pro-liberty manner; for example, they removed the hijab ban in universities and state institutions. I believe they were still corrupt back then, slowly appointing their partisans to positions in official institutions, favouring them everywhere etc. but it wasn't significant enough to disturb the majority (it was actually liked by the religious rural population and urban lower working-class whose interests were often undermined by the secular governments of the past) and he had the support of businessmen who were pretty content because of the good state of the economy.

Things started changing around 2011, when Erdogan started becoming more authoritarian with each passing day. 2013 was one of the peaks, when people started resisting his increasing authoritarianism and desire to turn everywhere into a corporate playground. It is also the year in which Erdogan's party split up with the fundamentalists I mentioned; the group, being in control of the police forces, exposed their corruption and arrested many people from Erdogan's government. He survived nonetheless, initiated an aggressive breakdown of any opposition and was still going relatively strong. He used the coup attempt in 2016 as an excuse to exercise total control over the country and made the regime semi-presidential, granting himself immense privileges and power. He became significantly more conservative and nationalist in the past 5 years.

The economy is now more fragile than ever because of Erdogan's stupid speeches. He practically controls the Central Bank and thinks his ideas on how to run an economy are more valid than actual economists' (he was originally an imam!), which frightens the investors. This is why most businessmen stopped being in favour of Erdogan, although Erdogan threatens them frequently to get what he wants.

And there you go, the story of a man with an iron fist. His authoritarianism is only making him less popular these days, but he has no choice but to hold onto it if he wants to stay. He supports his image using nationalistic nonsense which even he was blatantly against only a few years prior and by trying to arouse a meaningless patriotic feeling in people.

 com os “cancelados” do dia.

 Seria de grande utilidade para desatentos como eu, que não estão antenados às sentenças sumárias proferidas diuturnamente pelos tribunais da internet. Já me aconteceu várias vezes de estar num jantar, citar um artista e sentir o climão.

 Então alguém me cochicha: “Você não viu? Acharam um vídeo dele contando uma piada de papagaio numa entrevista de 1995. Cara, desrespeitava o papagaio, punha a ave numa posição humilhante;   
 ornitofobia nojenta!”.

 A coluna seria dupla: a dos cancelados pela direita e a dos cancelados pela esquerda. Na da direita, por exemplo: “Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca nasceu em Londres, em 1985. Formado em economia e filosofia, trouxe esperança de renovação para o conservadorismo brasileiro com seus artigos, vídeos e participações na rádio Jovem Pan.

 Quando, porém, Joel passou a fazer um quadro fixo ao lado do comunista globalista maconhista Leonardo Sakamoto, no Canal MyNews, foi imediatamente ‘cancelado’ pela direita. Uma trolagem de sétimo dia será dedicada a ele por 15 mil robôs, mais disparos massivos de WhatsApp, na próxima quinta, às 11:00. Joel deixa um pai, uma franja e uma pinta”.

  Ao lado, o “cancelamento” do Leonardo Sakamoto: “Há anos dedicado a pautas políticas e com forte engajamento social, Leo, como era conhecido pelos amigos, foi ‘cancelado’ após participar de um programa ao lado do fascista bolsominion homem branco hétero cis Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca.

 Um ato de esculacho coletivo está marcado para amanhã, diante da FFLCH, onde um boneco de Sakamoto com cartola do Tio Sam será incendiado ao som da bateria de maracatu da Letras —bacharelado em grego”. 

 A seção também poderia ter, nos moldes da coluna do Ronaldo Lemos, um “Já era”, “Já é”, “Já vem”, informando que crimes expiraram, quais os vigentes e uma aposta dos que virão.

 “Já era: fantasia de índio no carnaval (Raoni liberou)”. “Já é: falar “índio”. O termo correto agora é indígena”.” “Já vem: dar nomes para filhos. Eles que devem escolhê-los quando forem grandes. Ou não escolher. Afinal, dizer ao outro que me chamo Antonio é impor a ele a minha verdade, quando do ponto de vista dele, tão legítimo quanto o meu, posso ter muito mais cara de Adalberto, Sheylla ou Siegfrid Von-Tsé-Tung”. 

 A coluna terá um prazo para acabar, pois creio que em uma década não haverá mais um único terráqueo que não tenha sido “cancelado”. Talvez aí voltemos a nos dar conta do óbvio: o ser humano é complexo, tem virtudes e defeitos, às vezes tropeça, às vezes estende a mão —às vezes faz as duas coisas ao mesmo tempo. 

 [Como disse Obama, no ano passado](https://encurtador.com.br/lst57): “Essa ideia de pureza, de jamais transigir (...), vocês deveriam superar isso, rápido! O mundo é confuso. Há ambiguidades. Pessoas que fazem coisas muito boas têm falhas. Pessoas com quem você está lutando podem amar os filhos e ter algumas semelhanças com você.

 E um perigo que eu vejo nos jovens (...) é essa percepção, às vezes, de que a forma de promover a mudança é ser o mais crítico possível com os outros, e isso é suficiente.

 Se eu tuitar ou fizer uma # sobre como você fez algo errado ou usou o verbo errado, posso relaxar e me sentir muito bem comigo mesmo. (...) Quer saber? Isso não é ativismo.

Now, before the new law, you could buy any gun that isn't an automatic with a WES (Waffenerwerbsschein = weapons permit). This permit still exists but is only intended for guns that comply with the magazine restrictions with the caveat that you commit a crime if you insert a 20 round magazine into your semi auto rifle. So to still be able to own ""large"" magazines, Switzerland implemented The ABK (Asunahmebewilligung klein = special permit small). With this you can buy rifles and pistols with ""large"" magazines, but you need to either prove that you shoot or be an acknowledged collector. 

Now, the implementation of the ABK created a lot of chaos and unneeded bureaucracy since some guns fall between the seats and the federal gun bureaus (think state ATF) also don't really know how to classify certain stuff, like Roni kits and all. 

What changed for the better is that full auto guns that were converted to semi are now also obtainable with an ABK instead of a fullauto permit like before. Because before, a gun that was once fullauto is still considered fullauto.

Everything else more or less stayed the same.

The idea of a resurgent Byzantine Empire along the lines of the Komnenian restoration makes for interesting lines of thought but these are unfortunately irrelevant. The fringes of the Empire were already being picked off by the Bulgarians to the North, and the Muslims to the East and South. 


The Emperor had already pawned the royal jewels of his crown and sold the lead tiles of the palace. He had also already floated the idea of allowing the Orthodox Church to once again recognize the supremacy of Rome, however this ploy was unsuccessful and had at most received warm reception from Pope Innocent II and III.


So what happens next is that Constantinople is allowed to limp along until the Turks, Bulgarians or some other upstart enemy are able to besiege the city.  


It is important to note that the Theodosian Walls were not breached during the 4th Crusade, in fact the city was handed over in a coop of sorts that was months in the making by Alexius IV. Even Mehmed II's cannons could only pockmark the walls. So while the final fall of the city might be delayed for years, decades or even centuries it is arguably a foregone conclusion that it would remain a shadow of its former splendor. 


Ironically, Enrico Dandolo might be remembered as the saboteur of Venice as the sack of the city was instrumental to Venetian monopoly on trade and the birth of the Renaissance due to its recent acquisition of Ancient Roman texts and more contemporary Greek scholarship including those that fled the city. Therefore, we might see Genoa or Milan as the preeminent merchant republics which might rival the Netherlands at their height.

&gt;""The government has failed! The only solution is more government!""

It's not about prosecuting them. It's about allowing them in in the first place. Muslims raping people is a completely predictable consequence of bringing Muslims into another culture. The government DIDN'T restrict knowable rapists from coming in, rapists rapin' errybody up in here, stop letting rapists in. Other places should learn and stop letting rapists in before they have the same damn rape problem for the same reasons.

&gt; The problem isn't even with Muslims generally, it's specifically a subset of Pakistani immigrants responsible for rape gangs. Why then the collective guilt for all Muslims?

This is just not true. You need to get to understand Islam. Go study the life of Mohammed. Read some Islamic doctrine. Islam is submission to Allah, and conquest of others to bring them into submission to him. And not the ""convince everyone to agree with us"" conquest of Christianity, it's more like the ""kill everyone who isn't us"" conquest of Judaism, but without the mandate to a specific place and time in history. If you don't want to look at it from a perspective of understanding Islam, just look at the rape rates in communities with large numbers of Muslims throughout Europe. There's an explosive statistical difference that cannot be explained away. Look at what Muslims do where they're conquering territory today. Look at what they've done in the past. Rape always happens with conquest, but rape is particularly a part of Islam, because they're meant to subdue and Islamify places they conquer. Islam tells you not to rape - other muslims, that is. Raping a non-muslim isn't actually rape, because it's legitimate for you to conquer her and then you have a right to sex with her because you conquered her. The rape isn't the core problem, the conquering nature of Islam is. It's explicitly a violent totalitarian theistic statist culture, no more compatible with liberty than communism is.

You're right that RIGHT NOW we aren't seeing as much Islamic rape and violence in general in the US, because Muslims know damn well that they can't get away with it as easily here for the exact reasons you mentioned. But they're the same people, the same culture, coming from the same places - still behaving consistently with Islamic doctrine that tells them to bide their time and build their power and act peaceful until they are able to conquer the infidel.

&gt; Yes, but actually no. ""Benefit of the people"" is far too broad and vague. Literally every tyrant and dictator in the history of ever said their actions were being taken for ""the benefit of the people""---form Pol Pot to Kim Kong Un, from Idi Amin to Fidel Castro, from Pinochet to Hitler, all of them said they were murdering and oppressing for the benefit of the people.

&gt; If governments are to exist, they must exist with the consent of the governed for the purpose of securing individual rights---as our Declaration of Independence correctly said.

I agree, you put this much better than I did. I usually insist on defining the only legitimate purpose of government as maximizing liberty for the governed, IDK why I did not there.

&gt; Do you really trust the government to represent the will of the people?

No, that would be backwards. Whatever I think of the government (even if I'm an ancap) I must ultimately trust the people to kill the government if it's not representing their will. Of course people with any sort of power over us will tend to abuse it (government or not), we cannot shirk our responsibility to combat this.

&gt; No. Think this through. You're saying that me--a person with access to the labor and resources of many people--will be compelled to trade with (and acquiesce to the demands of) two individuals who have only their own person and the fruits of their own labor to offer. Why would I? What do you and Bob possess which would compel me to trade with you?

We are the only people around who currently believe in your liberty. We're your strongest trading partners, your mutual defense, and your best friends because we're the only people who share your culture. I'm sure you agree that ancapistan is inherently dependent on mutual cooperation and defense to have any actual advantage over just living in a country. Bob and I aren't particularly constraining you. We're only going to do this if you start allowing people who are anti-liberty to live on your property and thus enter our community. We understand that while the three of us value liberty, we're only three people, and if you bring in 40 communists, we're all likely to wake up one morning with our necks slit. We're not telling you you can ONLY do business with us, hell you can do business with statists, you just can't flood our community with statists and get us all killed or we're going to cut you off to save ourselves. Even if you feel safe housing tankies, given all the factors involved and the fact that we're only telling you not to do this one specific thing, the benefits of retaining your relationship with Bob and I will outweigh whatever you might gain from renting housing to tankies. If you still disagree with my scenario, feel free to modify it in your head. I'm sure you can agree with the fundamental point I'm getting at, like with the deliberately importing murderers example.

You're right that if our demands seem worse to you than going it alone, you'll go it alone. This is a huge part of why a successful ancapistan would by necessity have strong cultural unity and commitment to the core value of liberty. Without enough unity that people are willing to die defending each other, ancapistan falls apart and is conquered by conventional countries.

&gt; That's a very very interesting question, but one without an answer. I would point out, however, that the culture of liberty in statist systems is dying out the world over, where it ever existed in the first place. Can you honestly say even 50% of native-born Americans believe in liberty, as you understand liberty?

Without a complete and objective answer, sure, but not without an answer. Yes, liberty is in decline. So how is ancapistan going to happen? It will only happen if something like 1/3 of people want it. And if we continue bringing in people who oppose liberty, especially people who actively hate it and see it as innately immoral, that will happen some day because? You can't get a culture that values liberty more by adding people who value liberty less.

Yes.

&gt;Is any of this country thrive?

Compared to the USA? Absolutely! The US has been in a downward spiral for 45 years.

&gt;That's why US got biggest IT companies in the world

We invented the fucking computer, and have been ruining it ever since; why do you think your computer OS is such a piece of shit?

&gt;Give me at least one Europe IT company which can compete with mentioned firms

Company? Screw companies, I'll give on one person: Linus Torvalds. He has done more to advance IT than any company on Earth.

&gt;If we look back in our history the most development and research was actually done in most in-human system - capitalism

Actually, referring to IT specifically, the research was all military, from the original vacuum tube systems up through DARPA and the Internet.

Gee, why didn't some private company build Babbage's difference engine for 100 years after it was invented? **BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SEE A PROFIT IN IT!!!!**

AT&amp;T had the cell phone in 1973, but we didn't get them until the 1980s... after the government stepped in and broke AT&amp;T up.

In absolute wealth, yes; they have free college, though.

George didn't really care about the EU. He pulled interesting things from it, things that he liked, but he was more than content to let the EU do whatever it wanted.

Whats relevant though, is that when you are on your break, you are not allowed to any kind of work at all, you just have to rest.

according to this part i know this story takes place in the EU but it is not correct, you are allowed to drive for 4.5 hours straight and then indeed you have to take your 45 minute break, but let's say if you drive for 1 hour then get to your customer and do unloading for an hour this will not be added to your 4.5 hour drive time, so you would still be able to drive for 3 and a half hours after loading/unloading, now the kicker is here in the Netherlands (where i live) there is also the normal working hours law wich say that after every 5 hours you need to rest for one half hour,

&amp;#x200B;

so for example i'm driving to a client for 2 hours, then arrive do some loading/unloading for 30 minutes, then get back behind the wheel and drive for 1 more hour for the next customer, now the loading also takes an hour and half (slow client we all know them) so by normal working hours law here in the netherlands i am now required to take my 30 minute break, but according to driving laws i still should be able to drive for an hour and half. so i better take that 45 minute break at once then or i would only be able to drive for 1.5 hour and would need to take another break to follow the driving laws, wich would just be a huge time waste then.",True,False,False,,,0,1583077179,,False,0,{},fj6p9oi,False,t3_fbimvh,False,False,t3_fbimvh,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/fbimvh/no_paid_ovetime_you_say_ok/fj6p9oi/,False,,1590957799,7,True,False,MaliciousCompliance,t5_3boqz,r/MaliciousCompliance,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

&gt; Why should we cooperate economically with a country that weaponizes people?

I think it's important for world leaders to understand why certain decisions are being made. I don't agree with Erdoğan's decision, but regardless, leaders should understand the motivation. At face value, it appears that in addition to the usual flow of migrants, Turkey has become over encumbered with Syrian refugees from the civil war over the last 8 years. This has destabilized the economy and put many others out of work for a war that ultimately was backed by countries across the world.

So the question is, who is responsible for these refugees? Only the countries next door? The countries that are still involved? The original instigators? The most powerful countries? It appears Erdoğan believes it is all countries that were involved, including EU parties. While they agreed in 2016, they did not seem to stick with finding a solution and let Turkey continue to handle it primarily with it's own resources. This, he seems to think, was not part of the deal (to be fair it kinda wasn't).

&gt;&gt;Yes, but not in this way. We are not an endless charity. We need other solution as accepting them all won't solve the issue.

While we might not be endless, we should muster anything we can spare. So if thats not the solution, what is? Do you have a better solution to this problem?  
  
&gt;I know that, but i dont see how that has to do with anything, this is a vacuous statement

&gt;&gt;You have to be blind or oblivious not to see what harm it does to EU then. Perhaps if you looked from wider perspective you would see it is a systematic effort by Russia to shatter EU by funneling migrants towards Europe and for Erdogan to use this as a platform to further fuel his popularity by portraying EU as evil. If your course of action is to lay down and give up to these foreign attempts to divide us then be my guest, but don't complain later when what we worked for as an Union for all these years starts to trickle away.  
  
So why not tell me what harm it is by bringing in not even that many refugees? because the only downside of accepting refugees are short-term loss for local jobs.  
  
&gt;The division is that right wingers are just afraid of immigrants and therefore economic prosperity so i dont really consider their feelings since they and their policies drag europe down anyway.

&gt;&gt;Am I supposed to believe that multitudes of EU citizens who are turning to populism and right-wing politics are all evil racist jackboot wearing right-wingers now? This is not as simple as you might think. People are fed up. They don't want this to continue. And you have zero right to demonize them because they don't share a similar simplistic view of the entire crisis.

I woudnt say they're evil, but people are usually ignorant and not informed about an issue, so they look for simple solutions (which right wingers give them), what they give is fear, that spooky brown people are violent etc. which is not the case. DESPERATE people are always violent, dont make them to be desperate and the wont be violent. People are not fed up, they're just drinking paranoia coolaid. I dont demonize em, i just know they're policies and objectively wrong, its not really their fault that they're uninformed.  
  
&gt;And this is not an RTS game. People are not faceless units you put in the system hoping for positive economic growth. As I'm not that knowledgable about economy myself, I'm just going to say this is far more complicated and I'm not sure where you get this idea that it always leads to positive growth.
  
Except it is, you dont have to be an expert to know the right answer, the professionals, ECONOMIC CONSENSUS tells us that immigrants boosts economy. Please, dont believe me, try to look what majority economists say.  
  
&gt;I don't really understand what you mean by that response but it's very shortsighted not to see the causality between mass migration and sudden turn to populist movements in Europe.

Telling Canadians whose families have been living here since the 18th or 19th Century that they live on ""Indian land"" is a concept that will only cause hatred between 2 people. 

In 2020, separating people into groups based on their genetics, their ethnicity and assigning them different rights is something the KKK and the Nazi would be proud of.

**That is not to say that the Aboriginal people have not been mistreated, in fact, similarly to how we've treated Japanese Canadians during the 2nd World War and how we treated the Chinese Canadians during the building of Canada's railways, we certainly owe them an apology and owe them the resource they need to develop their communities' economies and improve the welfare of their people.**

But we need to dispense with the ""This is Indian Land"" thing because:

* It is incredibly divisive and serves no purpose other that throwing oil on fire.
* The ""invaders"" are not going to return to Europe or Asia or the Middle-East.
* It is incredibly insulting to those whose parents, grand-parents died for our freedoms.

At the end of the day, it would be detrimental to the country itself since, through time, those who came before us, the so-called ""white men"", managed to transform Canada into what the international community agrees is one of the best, if not the best, country in the world.

It would be like finding a good doctor who solves all of your health issues and then kicking him out of the door once you are healthy.

Just imagining that the Aboriginal people could have been left alone in Canada without the protection of the ""white man"" against the expansionist policies of the U.S. is laughable.

Without the ""white man"", the Canadian Aboriginal people would be American... [And you don't have to wonder how well they would be doing.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoppisch/2011/12/13/why-are-indian-reservations-so-poor-a-look-at-the-bottom-1/#4412e9a13c07)

**Maybe that many Aboriginal communities are poor because of the Aboriginal political system.**

As land on reservations is usually held communally, individual Aboriginals cannot used it to establish personal credit, it is illogical to invest money in a home sitting on land you do not personally own. So they live in damaged, sub-standard homes.

Without private ownership of the land, individual Aboriginal people cannot use it as collateral for a business loan, a loan that would help them create wealth.

If they ban these kids from working then it may actually be worse for these kids since they would have nothing to do and they would not be making any money for their families. 

Why do people feel they need to impose Western customs and ideals on others. Everyone is not the same, and every country is run differently. Just because child labor is banned in Western countries does not mean it is bad everywhere else. Again, there are no fully functioning school systems in these countries.

Eh?

&gt;1) How can you moan about ""right wing brexit"" when the EU is center right? Its purpose is to promote capitalist neoliberalism in Europe. 

???  Brexit is (almost entirely) a right-wing thing. Most EU countries are currently right / centre right, indeed too much of the world is in my opinion. Why does that necessitate hatred of the EU?

&gt;It was set up as a poltical counterpart to the the communist bloc (NATO being the military equivalent). 

Not quite that simple. Here's a quote from the wiki - *""After World War II, European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated parts of the continent.""*

&gt;There is no free at the point of use healthcare in most of europe. 

I know, I've lived and worked in multiple EU countries.

&gt;You have to pay to see a doctor in Sweden, there is no legal aid in Croatia. Italy Spain Poland Hungary ect all are far more conservative than Johnson, in Poland abortion is illegal unless its rape or incest. Bulgeria elected its Tsar as prime minister. 

Shameful isn't it. 

&gt;So this idea that many SNP types have that the EU is some kind of counterbalance to the local rightists here is nonsense. 

Yet a left(ish)-voting country like Scotland would likely not elect former-Tsars and psychos who make abortion illegal etc etc etc, and being a member of the EU would provide securities and assurances (not to mention guaranteed rights) when it comes to employment law and food standards and so on and so on. 

&gt;2) The peoppe in countries in eastern europe that are not in the EU are pretty much just as poor as those not in. You might says ""that's cause communism and Hitler's genocide'. Fair point but communism ended 30 years ago and the people in ex Yugoslavia the Baltic and Bulgaria are all still poor by our standards (though not by African or Asian standards). That's plenty of time to catch up but they haven't. 

That's not correct, see previous comment. And how long is ""plenty of time to catch up?"" What are the former and current economic conditions of all the countries you refer to? And how are all the economies of the countries you refer to comparable?

&gt;3) plenty of other non EU countries have caught up with the UK. South Korea is richer than anywhere in eastern europe. And it like them only became a democracy in the late 80s. The Japnese treated them the way the Germans treated the Poles and it lasted for 35 years. Then less than 10 years after the war it was wrecked in the korean war. Despite all that S Korea today is a powerhouse. 

USA donating over 3100 million dollars and then some in the form of aid and military support to South Korea.

&gt;Same with Argentina which had a civil war 40 years ago and economy in the toilet. So if they could go from being from being borderline third world countries to frist world countries in 35 years why hadnt Eastern Europe done the same? Romania has more oil than Norway or anywhere in Europe (where do you think the Whermarcht's tank fuel came from?). What's stopping them? Why arent they as rich as Norway? Or at least Portugul ? South Korea has no oil and they did it.

*""Romania holds 600,000,000 barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, ranking 44th in the world and accounting for about 0.0% of the world's total oil reserves of 1,650,585,140,000 barrels.

Vou tentar exemplificar, digamos que o vírus esteja na sua mão, aí você sem querer passa no rosto (em uma mucosa, por exemplo, como o olho), a sua chance de contrair o vírus aumenta muiiito.

Agora pense em uma luva, digamos que o vírus se encontre na superfície da luva. Se você sem querer passar a luva no rosto, o vírus irá passar para as suas mucosas da mesma maneira, entende? Melhor do que utilizar uma luva, basta lavar as mãos com álcool gel, já que ele tem propriedade de eliminar o vírus.

Em resumo, se você não for funcionário de saúde, não faz muita diferença usar luvas, já que as luvas não possuem propriedade de matar vírus ou bactérias.

Why are you lying about this? We have literal evidence of FTTs shrinking economies in Europe. 

We know that taxing transactions at even .1% has an effect. Taxing transactions lowers the price of stocks. This is the same as saying it raises the price of capital to corporations. A higher cost of capital leads to less investment and that in turn leads to a smaller economy. You seem knowledgeable in economics so I’m surprised that I’m having to explain this to you. 

Not only does this hurt working peoples retirements, it also causes us to bring in net negative revenue to the gov. Given that Uncle Sam gets around 35% of the economy each year if the economy is smaller by, say, 1% at some future date then Uncle Sam will be getting 0.35% of GDP less in tax. If the economy is that 1% smaller as a result of the FTT then tax revenues are about 0.35% of GDP smaller than they would have been in the absence of the tax.

The European Union’s estimates were that the economy would be 1.75 to 2% smaller after the FTT than it would have been without it. So, using that tax revenues for the US would be roughly 0.7% of GDP less after the FTT. But, of course, we need to add the actual revenues from the FTT itself. But that $340 billion is some 0.2% of GDP. So, we gain 0.2% of GDP from the FTT and lose 0.7% from the effects of the FTT.

That isn't for you to decide. It is clearly laid out in the  1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees what a refugee is and the criteria they must meet. Back in 2015 when people like you were saying the same nonsense 80% of applicants were successfully deemed to be genuine refugees and given asylum. If these people get proccessed and it turns out their not refugees then and only then can they be deported.

&gt;The only terrible thing here is your education. Millions of them ?  That's simply factually incorrect, only small numbers of any of them  managed to escape and they didn't settle in any of those countries  permanently. In most countries they didn't stay for more than a year.

Caso queira estudar meeeesmo, aí é tentar prestar atenção na aula e fazer 200 exercícios de algum dos livros principais. Seu professor provavelmente vai recomendar algum. A maioria das pessoas que eu conheço que foram muito bem em cálculo, foi porque faziam muitos exercícios, muitos mesmo.

Em física eu gostava do livro do Halliday, ele é muuuito didático e tem exercícios difíceis que podem te dar uma boa base também.

Programação o segredo é adaptar seu cérebro, a medida que for fazendo exercícios você vai melhorando. Tem alguns sites tipo code academy ou videos no YouTube que podem te ajudar bem.

Como dica geral, pegar provas com os seus colegas e veteranos dos anos anteriores ajuda muito, pois você sabe melhor em que parte do conteúdo focar e que tipo de questão cai, se for do mesmo professor é bem capaz de cair até a mesma questão.
Não recomendo estudar em grupo a menos que você seja a pessoa ensinando. Quando ensinamos aprendemos bastante, pois temos que consolidar melhor para passar para o outro.

I use ethernet to reduce jitter, and cap any other device on the network to 10mbps in the router settings. I run shadow on a 25mbps as that's most stable for me and gives overhead and image quality at 1080p is good.

As for how it works shadow have data centers in the US and Europe. Your individual shadow is a virtualized machine and you get either a 4 core or 6 core CPU which runs collectively on a higher core CPU (the CPU is split). The GPU is a workstation card equivalent to a gtx 1080 or higher. From my understanding shadow encodes directly from the video buffer on the card to reduce latency. 

My opinion is shadow is good even at the boost tier, but the CPU could be better in terms of frequency cause IPC wise its on the same performance level of my thin and light laptop. So I recommend searching up benchmark videos with the card/tier you want to get and reducing the average FPS by 10 to 20 percent.

&gt; 
&gt; Why?

Begin from the premise that slavery is wrong, then work backwards.

&gt;&gt;If yer interested in getting to the truth, then do renters powerwash the grime off the siding or not?

&gt;That's irrelevant. We're talking about owning the land, not performing maintenance (which anybody could do, owner or otherwise).

Maintenance is a relevant benefit of ownership. Renters do not powerwash the grime off the siding, but the grime needs powerwashing.

&gt; I don't agree that private ownership of land is not theft.

Your argument is with the dictionary, not me.

&gt;The difference is between things that are artificial and things that are naturally occurring. You're implicitly suggesting that this difference is irrelevant, but it is, of course, extremely relevant.

Good grief. Tell me why it's relevant. I shouldn't have to ask. You are obviously unaccustomed to argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We can trust the Constitution because of its huge success.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Using that same logic, we could also trust the Bible, the Koran, and many other religious texts.

&gt;&gt;No. Religious texts are for individual spirituality so their 'success' is subjective and variable. The Constitution has provable empirical success germane to this conversation.

&gt;That just sounds like an excuse.

No, that's a reason.

&gt;What makes one sort of success more relevant than another? 

The success of the West, ushering in the defeat of starvation and child mortality and exposure, is a relevant success. Relevance is not only empirical, it's obvious, so your oblivity is noted.

&gt;And if you have such a standard, why do you need the Constitution at all, instead of just using that standard?

The cognitive dissonance has made your strawgrasping more desperate. Looking back at this thread, anyone can see you have no reasonable points and no game. This is a losing battle for you.

&gt;&gt;Where I live, the poorest people have food cards, shelter, schooling, cell phones.

&gt;Many of them could have better, if they weren't denied access to land.

No. The poor do better where there are protected property rights.

&gt;&gt;Poverty dropped precipitously since global capitalism took root

&gt;Capitalism has been successful despite private landownership, not because of it.

You have no data suggesting that. The correlation between private ownership and societal success is clear.

&gt;In the 1860s, Japan abolished the old feudal system and shifted government funding onto land taxes;

You don't fund taxes.

&gt;it subsequently accomplished the same industrialization in the next 40 years that Europe had in the previous 200.

Japan remodeled itself on the West, not geoism. Japan's success is due to capitalism, which is private property rights-protective.

&gt;Denmark in the 1950s implemented land taxes 

Denmark achieved success by being incredibly capitalist and never adopted geoism. Classical liberals are all for tax reform and not against land taxes. Denmark, with its low business tax and liberal regulatory environment, has much to teach us.

&gt;&gt;You will simply have to buy cheaper land.

&gt;But that land might not be in a place where I can afford to live (with proximity to jobs, etc).

People have been investing infrastructure in the now-expensive land for generations. You can't just demand that investiture be forgotten.

&gt;My point is that, if a person who lives alone in the world owns all the land, then it seems like when there are two (or more) people in the world, each of those people would own more than 0% of the land.

Your ability to own land is unhampered except by your own choosiness. You would rather have land that others have invested in. Sensible but unfair to such investors, whose investments are conducive to a functioning society.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And when Pol Pot rallied Cambodians with socialist promises, a lot of the Cambodians he rallied didn't get the state they were calling for. What we have to do is stop calling for powerful states.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. Because the alternative is being subjected to the whims of powerful landowners.

&gt;&gt;No, and Cambodia the very worst example to make that claim. 

&gt;Yes, it literally is. That's the point of owning land. That's what makes owning land lucrative.

Growing food and selling that food is not subjecting anyone to your whims. Most people like food, goods, and services.

&gt;&gt;The landowners in Cambodia had no control over the populace, they just grew food for the hungry people

&gt;Then they weren't very effective landowners. (But I think I'd need to see some sort of source on this before I believe it.)

Cambodians, like Russians, Chinese, Ethiopians, etc., were not starving before socialism. Sources abound. Are you writing with a quill on vellum?

&gt;&gt;But somehow I think you are going to try to escape the inescapability with a crazy plan to control all land with a single entity, making that entity incredibly powerful as the only landlord available.

&gt;First, this isn't about controlling the land. It's just about sharing out land value fairly.

You're trying to sell it that way, but you're also making socialist claims like property is theft. 

&gt; If the state is not acting on behalf of the public, then it isn't doing its job properly, and must be changed (perhaps even with violent force). But not having one is not a viable option if we are at all interested in moral justice.

This is /r/Classical_Liberals, not /r/Anarchism.

&gt;&gt;There's no stealing.

&gt;Yes, there is. We are all born, through no choice of our own, into a world where the land is all owned by other people and we are beholden to them for our very freedom to stand on the Earth's surface.

Ownership is not stealing because that's not what the words mean. Ownership is proven to benefit society, and top-down control of land is proven to cause famines and democide.

&gt;If an evil scientist released a genetically engineered virus around the world that caused all babies from that point forward to be born deaf, it would be reasonable to say that those babies have been robbed of their sense of hearing.

If that was proven to benefit society, I would be okay with that.

&gt;&gt;Owning ≠ stealing

&gt;Not as a general rule, no. But private ownership of land is stealing, because land is not artificial.

Whether I'm planting a seed or planting irrigation, I get to keep the fruits of my labor.

&gt;&gt;You are not excluded from owning land.

&gt;Yes, I am.

There is literally [free land](https://www.cnbc.com/2010/11/16/7-Towns-Where-Land-is-Free.html) available.

&gt;regardless of whether they had any hand in making that change to the economy

Land works as an absentee investment, like most investments.

&gt;&gt;you didn't put any time or effort into that land so you don't get the fruits of other's labor.

&gt;I don't want the fruits of others' labor. I want the natural resources that were there by default.

There is unimproved land available, cheap. Land you did not improve yourself has been improved by others and is more expensive as a result. You do want the fruits of others' labor.

&gt;&gt;US Cities started as natural ports on navigable rivers, but spread outwards based on vicinity to that port and the burgeoning infrastructure

&gt;Exactly. The construction of the infrastructure just served as a multiplier effect on the land's value as a consequence of being close to natural waterways.

Infrastructure creates land value. Land that has not been invested in is cheap. I can only phrase that so many ways.

&gt;And yet you still don't see new cities popping up in random locations

New cities pop up all the time--nothing is random.

&gt;It's only efficient to build infrastructure on land that is already valuable.

Nonsense. You're done.

&gt;That's not what I want. I want a government that treats people justly and fairly.

Non, justement. La majorité refuse d'utiliser les outils à sa disposition pour pouvoir accuser l'opposition d'abus démocratique. C'est une méthode détestable puisqu'elle s'attaque au fondement qu'est la vie parlementaire, à savoir la tenue de débats. Le problème dans cette séquence politique, ce n'est pas l'usage du 49.3. Le problème, c'est que le but poursuivi est de décrédibiliser les institutions.

Ce qu'il faut comprendre ici, c'est que toutes les manoeuvres politiques ne sont pas démocratiques, et qu'il en est qui fragilisent ou menacent cette dernière.

Ce genre de mise en accusation (""opposition qui sabote"", ""démocratie impuissante"") est un classique des attaques contre le parlementarisme, une des étapes classiques qu'on peut trouver dans les régimes qui connaissent un tournant autoritaire. 
C'est d'autant plus préoccupant qu'on a déjà vu cette majorité utiliser les mêmes méthodes pour saper d'autres pilliers de la démocratie comme la presse ou la liberté d'expression.

Quand elles sont menées par l'opposition, ces attaques sont généralement peu efficaces, puisqu'elles sont démenties par une majorité fonctionnelle. Mais quand la majorité décide de mettre en scène une démocratie inefficace et de la critiquer, l'opposition n'a pas les moyen de l'en empêcher.

&gt; C'est toujours pareil : jusqu'au moment où tu veux passer quoi que ce soit qui soit à la fois important et diviseur.

Encore une fois : temps législatif programmé. Ca n'existe pas pour rien, c'est là pour ça. Aucune des lois du mandat n'a eu besoin d'un 49.3 jusqu'à maintenant, et la raison est simple : le gouvernement n'a pas à lutter contre une fronde, comme c'était le cas sous Valls.

The Holy See deals with a huge amount of sensible diplomatic information -there's a reason journalists call the Vatican ""The Listening Post"", for information from all across the globe passes through it. The practice of keeping a sealed archive that only opens after several decades have passed (in order to be more or less sure everyone involved has already passed away or that the information won't really cause any political or diplomatic incident) was thus developed. Similar methods are used by multiple agencies and governments around the world. The Church was just the first to develop it, since it was also more-or-less the creator of modern diplomacy.

People hear the word ""Secret Archive"" and immediately think ""Occult Conspiracies"", but the word actually means ""Private"" as in, this is the Pope's personal repository, documents and letters sent to/by the Pope, a lot of them dealing with administrative stuff, but some of it being correspondence with nuncios, ambassadors, world-leaders, etc, the latter being the more sensible ones.

Think of it this way: in the 1700's popes most likely got letters from kings, cardinals, bishops, and ambassadors from all over Europe, dealing with information on potential wars, invasions, social reforms, theological conflicts, etc. Furthermore, the popes themselves were heads of state of a huge chunk of Italy, themselves often involved in alliances, wars, secret treaties, etc. So a large amount of the pope's personal documents were more than just documents of national security -they were of continental, sometimes even planetary security. In that context, it made total sense for this rule to develop; wait 70 years, and probably every war, treaty, plot, or dispute mentioned has likely already sorted itself out, every king and cardinal involved long dead already.

You can correct me if I’m wrong, since I’m not an expert on Europe, but I believe your foregoers paid a lower tax rate which would have helped them save.

I can speak to this point. I am a public librarian in a smaller library in the Midwest, USA and one of my staff has the title ""Local Historian and Genealogist"". She does a lot of exactly what you think with that title: she maintains our library's local history resources (e.g. microfilm archived copies of the local paper, local high school yearbooks, early documents from the city's early days), is the go-to expert for such questions (we get more than you might think), hosts programs involving history both local and in general (e.g. an adult book club that mostly reads history non-fiction), and more, in addition to the more general librarian duties of circulation and reference (which everyone does).

Although the local historian wasn't working, yesterday I had a person come in looking for local history resources. I know enough about what we have to get her started, but if she is still interested I will make sure she speaks with the historian. I also have a regular patron who recently has been asking me for resources on various topics, such as general Medieval European/Early Chinese/Mesoamerican historical overviews, the economics of the Roman Empire, what life was like for a serf or peasant in Medieval Europe, etc. Having a decent history knowledge is helpful even as a non-historian librarian!

History, social sciences (e.g. I have a background in political science), and humanities all synergize nicely with public librarianship. Depending on what you want in life, it can be an excellent job for a historian. A well rounded library staff will have people with a diverse background: for example, I have a linguistics and poli sci background, which no one else have meaning I have some specialized knowledge and perspective compared to everyone else.

[],,FlashbackHistory,,,t,,,dark,t2_3vgvw52k,[],"There were cases of armies using and issuing lever-action rifles during the 1860s and 1870s. However, these lever-action rifles were used chiefly because they were the only repeating rifle available. As the technology for magazine-fed bolt-action rifles arrived on the scene in the 1880s, everyone adopted them, for reasons we'll get into.

Most people are familiar with the use of Henry and Spencer rifles during the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. However, there's an even more notable moment in lever-action history most people don't know about.

During the [1877 Siege of Plevna](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/plevna/theplevnadelay.html), Turkish troops used about 8,000-12,000 Winchester .44 Model 1866 rifles to great effect. Turkish soldiers carried two rifles in the battle: the lever-action [Model 1866](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/TurkWin.htm) and the single-shot, falling-block [.45 Peabody-Martini](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/TPeabMar.htm). The Peabody-Martinis were used to hit Russian troop formations up to 2,000 yards away. Once Russian troops go within 200 yards of their trenches, the Turkish soldiers switched to their Winchester rifles and poured rapid fire into the Russians. Once the Russians got within 50 yards, the Turks fell back to their next trench line and kept firing. Although the Turks eventually surrendered, they'd managed to delay the Russian advance into Bulgaria for a full five months and cost the Russians 40,000 dead and wounded.

The fighting at Plevna was just one factor that pushed European countries to adopt repeating rifles of their own during the 1880s (e.g. the Krag–Jørgensen, Lee-Metford, Lebel Model 1886, and the Gewehr 88), although bolt-actions were universally adopted as the preferred form of repeating rifl.

Lever-action guns were used in WWI in some numbers, although there were used simply because bolt-action rifles weren't available or were more badly-needed elsewhere.

* [**British Contract Winchester 1892:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-S65d9bAmc) About 15,000 Winchester 1892 rifles chambered in .44-40 were used by the British, mostly by Royal Navy boarding parties and Q-Ship crews. The short, handy carbine was more useful aboard ship than a Lee-Enfield or a Long Lee. The first 1,000 were donated to the War Office by patriotic baronet. In February 1915, 9,000 more rifles were ordered, followed by 2,000 in May 1915 and 3,000 in August 1915. The British ordered 3 million, of which at least some were fired in anger. The crew of the Q-Ship that sunk the German submarine UB-4 blazed away at the U-Boat with at least one Winchester rifle from just 10 yards away!
* [**French Contract Winchester 1894:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9kPggzvYtg)  In September 1914, the French ordered 15,100 of these rifles in .30-30 from Remington (yes, Remington), their primary arms supplier in the United States, who then sub-contracted Winchester to actually build the rifles. These rifles were issued to artillerymen, railway troops, motorcycle couriers, and even the odd balloonist. Once again, the short lever-action rifles were compact and handy weapons for men who had to carry a weapon, but didn't expect to do much shooting. Because the .30-30 wasn't a French-made round and wasn't easy to get, the 1894s were never issued to combat troops. The logistical hassle was just too great.
* [**Russian Contract Winchester 1895**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grSRn5wnHI) (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL9JKassTD4), as well): About 300,000 of these rifles chambered the Russian 7.62x54R cartridge were ordered by the Russians between 1915 and 1917 (about 70% of the 1895s ever made). These rifles were just some of the 4 million military rifles (including millions of Mosin-Nagants) Russia ordered from the USA during the war, something I've [written about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ai02kz/in_reading_the_family_romanov_it_is_said/eeqp70f/). It wasn't that the Russians thought the lever-action was especially good or especially bad. It was just that Winchester had the capacity to quickly modify its existing production line to produce a 7.62x54R version of the 1895. Building new Mosin-Nagant production lines in the U.S. was still worth pursuing, but it'd take time. And Russia needed rifles *now*.

Another point - Luxembourg is modeling the free to ride consult after Dunkirk, France's system. Dunkirk wanted to increase ridership, and after offering free rides, they increased ridership - by 60%. They had the capacity, they just needed the riders. 


Luxembourg is the most the most highly car dependant nation in Europe with 670 cars for every 1000 citizens. They don't have an extensive bus system and they don't run subways. The system exists of trams that serve major routes, only. The system has only been around since 2017 (it was cancelled in the 70s, and rebuilt in the new millenium), and as a result, their ridership is very low. It makes sense that they would push transit. 


Now, imagine if TTC was free and capacity is the same as is right now, and ridership spiked by 60%, just like it did in Dunkirk. 60% more people on the subway or streetcar during rush hour. 60% more people waiting to get onto an already over-capacity bus. 60% more people trying to get onto a crowded shuttle bus when tracks are being repaired or there is an issue along the line. In pure numbers, TTC already has roughly 1.7 million customers every day. A 60% spike in ridership would be about 1.02 million additional customers, or a total of about 2.72 million customers per day. The system might be free, but half the people who would want to ride would be unable to even get on a bus, streetcar or subway. The already over burdened system would literally be crushed. Turning away half their customers is no way for a business to survive.

For starters Chinese companies don’t respect intellectual property. Take a look at the Chinese car industry, they have companies that make direct knock offs of all the worlds biggest selling cars, for the Chinese only market.

To me it also comes across as western producers only winning (getting equal sales) because of the governments backing. It doesn’t suggest if the western producers will target high quality (reusable, reliable, repairable) products or low quality (disposable) products. If they target low quality then it’ll just be the same crap as Chinese made but a slightly higher price.

To me the only way western producers can get the upper hand is to target high quality products and blow the competition out of the water, but that in itself isn’t enough because if you sell a high quality repairable product then you eliminate resale, therefore reducing sales and loose the market to the competition.

If you introduce tariffs and quotas to imported goods for the aim of limiting cheap products on the market, then you’ll also have to give up something else in a trade deal. So not really winning, just shifting a problem to a different industry probably.

The only true way is to teach the consumer that buying high quality products which are reliable, reusable and repairable is the best thing to do. That in itself isn’t easy because there’s literally companies out there doing it now and not really succeeding.

Britain at the minute has limitations on what it can do due to EU legislation which prevents government aid to businesses and market manipulation. I hope that one thing to come from Brexit is that the government COULD help businesses with good ethical / eco friendly aims to succeed, this could be by teaching the consumer as opposed to direct aid to the business itself.

Albizia julibrissin (Persian silk tree, pink silk tree) is a species of tree in the family Fabaceae, native to southwestern and eastern Asia.The genus is named after the Italian nobleman Filippo degli Albizzi, who introduced it to Europe in the mid-18th century, and it is sometimes incorrectly spelled Albizzia. The specific epithet julibrissin is a corruption of the Persian word gul-i abrisham (گل ابریشم) which means ""silk flower"" (from gul گل ""flower"" + abrisham ابریشم ""silk"").

Albizia julibrissin was described by Antonio Durazzini. John Gilbert Baker used the same scientific name to refer to Prain's Albizia kalkora, the Mimosa kalkora of William Roxburgh.

All data I took came from Liquipedia and I putted it in Google Sheets, in the future I want you guys to give access to this file to fully explore all the stats across all PL matches played, until I have completed my project I will post some interesting stats along the way. If you have an idea for future stats that YOU would like to see just say it and I will look into it if this is possible without to much work. I hope you guys like this idea of these bans across the maps since I like making these stats ;-}

Most of the UK is still gonna look pretty much like the UK now.  And I really don't think that covid-19 and the stock market are going to be such a big deal over time.

But as to things that will change and what one might do about them:

* Brexit kills off a lot of trade deals.  Negotiate trade deals, one by one.  The UK is doing this and plans to continue, so this is pretty straightforward.

* I don't know what the EU will and will not object to; the geopolitics here seem to me to be one of the bigger wild cards.  What will the UK-Turkey relationship look like, for example?  Will the EU take issue with the UK building up blocs near the EU?  In general, what are the (realistic) geopolitical red lines for the EU moving into the future?  The UK is going to have to figure out what she wants her role to be and how she aims to secure her interests -- the UK's already announced a ""sweeping review"" of defense and so forth policy, and there's been reference to it on the sub.

* I've mentioned before that the UK doesn't have a codified constitution, and that a sovereign Parliament is something of an obstacle to any system with that.  The EU treaties, in combination with the assumption that the UK would not Brexit, formed something of a base for ""high law"" in the UK -- Parliament *could* leave, but as long as it was unwilling to, the issues go away.  However, now that foundation is gone.  So the UK might look at a constitution again -- she is one of the very, very few countries today without one.  I personally think that there are solid arguments for one, and you can hear people on this sub regularly making arguments about the basic structure of British government and what it should look like.  I've seen talk about the role of (or existence of) the House of Lords, a replacement for same, the role of courts, changes to the voting system, changes to the status of the constituent portions fo the UK, the role of the monarchy, civil rights guarantees, and on-and-on-and-on.   This isn't something with an immediate deadline -- but it's a matter that I believe that Brexit reopens, something and obviously it's a big and open-ended question.

* Farming is, based on what I've been reading about talk over ending subsidy and re-wilding, going to fall off.   ([""EU direct payments make up about 60% of the profits of UK farmers, rising to 90% for livestock hill farms and are worth £3bn a year in total.""](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/brexit-end-boom-in-farmland-prices-forecasts-say)) That means that some people will move from rural areas to urban areas.  I don't know how much of this will amount to farms merging and how much of it will amount to land coming out of cultivation.  If a substantial portion of land is brought out of cultivation, my guess is that this will be, for some of it, the first time in a long time.  In the United States, we had a vast wilderness, and chose areas to protect before they were settled, and so had some freedom as to how to structure nature preserves and the like.  In the United Kingdom, one has some ability to aim to re-create Britain as it once was -- which would be a very-long-term project -- or try to craft something novel, [as she did on Ascension Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BUDEUwx0hE).  It might look parklike or forest-like.  It might make it less-costly for the government or companies to buy land to build out road/rail/power transmission/data lines or other things that require a right-of-way.

* So far, the UK has been coasting on her existing immigration policy.  She's going to have to make some politically-difficult decisions about who to let into the country and on what terms.  I personally think that high-volume, skill-based immigration from around the world on levels comparable to that of Australia or Canada is a good idea -- for the foreseeable future, someone's economy and power is bound to their population -- but it's also obviously going to mash into some people's reasons for voting Brexit.",True,False,False,,,0,1583107464,,1583109365,0,{},fj88fo7,False,t3_fbzeui,False,True,t3_fbzeui,/r/ukpolitics/comments/fbzeui/what_change_would_you_want_implemented_if_the_uk/fj88fo7/,False,,1590984191,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

One could start with the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which provided a legal avenue for American interventionism in the Central and South Americas should they, or any colonialist powers in Europe attempt to extend or consolidate their influence in direct opposition to US interests. This subsequently led (among others things) to the Britsh reasserting sovereignty over the Falkland islands and the blockading of Argentina by the French and British. The USA relied heavily on the Birtish navy to enforce the doctrine in its infancy, which is why British influence in Latin America went largely unopposed. 

The doctrine was heavily styled after British and French anti-colonialist strategies to stifle international competition from hostile powers. The Roosevelt Corollary solidified this ""Big Stick"" method, as it was called. With much of the legal ground work laid out, the US was free to assert itself more agressively in Central and South America, leading to interventions in Guatamala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela (among others) and the various ""Banana Republics"" that sprung up. The Iran-Contra scandal was a direct result of the Reagan administration's attempt to fund the Contras in Nicaragua with arms sales to Iran, directly at odds with the Nicaraguan populations majority support for the democratically elected Sandinista regime. The Philippines and Hawaii are hardly considered cases for ethical annexation. 

The invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians, armed by the US government, who were fully aware of how they intended to use them. The Iranian revolution of 1954, democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown by a coup supported by the US and UK, largely countering attempts to nationalize their oil industry. US support of Iraq in Saddam's invasion of Iran, where chemical weapons were used in direct defiance of the UN. 

WW1 was caused primarily by Europe's increasing destabilization, exacerbated by the US to some degree. Not to mention the stringent economic conditions imposed on Germany post-WW1, which historians largely agree helped foster an evironment necessary to produce the National Socialist German Workers Party, of which America, now considered the dominant international power, had a large hand in shaping. 

Support of Cuban dictatorships pre-Fidel, US policies post-Fidel, the Bay of Pigs/Cuban Missile Crises, weren't considered potentially detrimental to the entire world by the entire world at all.

The Vietnam/Korean wars. Aid to the Mujahedin against the Soviets, which birthed many of the extremist groups that America ironically uses as the primary excuse to expand it's economic and political interests today. Afghanistan, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia etc the list goes on.

Achei que vc entendia de direito. Lei: representa ""a justiça"", deve ser a mesma para todos. Legislação: Uma regra ""privada"", ou seja, uma regra que uma instituição legítima coloca sobre sua propriedade

Se vc considera uma instituição governamental como legítima, ele podem colocar uma legislação tipo ""todos menos ele podem entrar sem camisa"", que isso é ok, pq ela é a dona legítima de determinada área. Uma legislação, entretanto, não pode ir contra a lei

Uma diferenciação de idade para cargos eletivos é uma legislação da instituição que aquele cargo se refere, e não uma lei

&gt;O PROCESSO NORMATIVO é igual, ainda que o conteúdo seja diferente

O processo normativo ser PARECIDO não faz com que o conteúdo seja comparável. Ficar gritando isso não vai mudar

Há diferenças relevantes no funcionamento de ambos que faz a comparação não ser válida

Vc pode continuar gritando isso, se quiser, não vai fazer diferença

&gt;Banheiro: lei

Não, não tem lei pra isso

&gt;Da velocidade em rodovias: lei. Idade mínima pra aposentar: lei

Ambos são legislações/regras

&gt;O ""veículo grande"" não é o ""veículo pequeno"" porque o qualificador condiciona a referência a um tipo de existência particular. Se você aceita velocidades diferentes pra caminhão e pra carro você furou seu raciocínio

#
&gt;E condição do veículo é uma medida subjetiva, diferentemente de tamanho

Tamanho pra ser veículo leve e pesado não é subjetivo. Além disso isso tbm é legislação, já que se eu for dono de uma rodovia ela pode ter a velocidade que eu quiser

&gt;Ela existe sim e, o mais engraçado, tem suas raízes nos gregos tbm (especialmente Aristóteles)

&gt;Erradíssimo, Aristóteles defende a proposição de equidade ao invés de igualdade

&gt; March 1, 2020, 10:36 a.m. ET.ORESTIADA, Greece - Greece deployed military forces to the country&amp;#039;s northern border with Turkey on Sunday to fortify the area and to repel a stream of migrants after Turkey opened the floodgates to the European Union over the weekend.

&gt; The fortification of the border came after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey confirmed on Saturday that he was opening Turkey&amp;#039;s border for migrants to enter Europe, saying that his country could no longer handle the huge numbers of people fleeing the war in Syria.

&gt; Turkey&amp;#039;s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in a tweet on Sunday that more than 76,000 people had left Turkey for Greece - a drastically inflated number, according to ground reports from both sides of the border.

We’ve already established that the US doesn’t have a meaningful social safety net compared to other countries. You agreed you were wrong here. So any laziness here CANNOT be blamed on social safety nets. Rather, I think it’s fair to say it’s the lack of social programs in the US that cause laziness and hopeless because there is no way to get ahead. I mean, the US is famous for it’s lack of social mobility and structural poverty.

&gt; Youve proven fuck all.

I’ve proven you wrong your claim that the US is diverse and your claim that the US has more of a social safety net than most countries and your claim that the US does more for “nonwhites” than other countries. Look back, you conceded these point by not responding to them. I get it, you’re not an honest person or trying to act in good faith here, but get real man. If you’re this intellectually lazy, it’s no wonder you can’t get a job.

&gt;  your the problem there is no privilege here only hard work and responsibility.

Taking personal responsibility is only possible under socialism. Likewise, hard work is only rewarded under socialism. Why do you think the US does so poorly when it comes to social mobility, especially compared to more socialist leaning developed economies (Western Europe, Canada, etc). These are just facts. Countries’ like the US you are stuck in your place by birth. You can’t get a good education if you don’t have money. So hard work and responsibility will never help you improve your life. So people give up. Check out this timely video: https://youtu.be/M9_qFrcWeUU

If capitalism is so good, what are 96% of the poorest countries in the world all capitalist? And is the average socialist country richer than the average capitalist country? Why are people happier living in more socialist countries? It seems strange to me that you defend a system that has so repeatedly been shown to be such a failure.

&gt; Socialism does NOT work ask anyone from a communist country its all fucked

Huh? This is well documented to be false. In former eastern block countries, people who lived under both overwhelmingly prefer communism. Maybe don’t believe everything Fox and CNN feed you. Remember, the US media is hyper-conservative. Though, I don’t know why you’re bringing up communism here. Socialism and communism are not the same thing.

Over my 25 year career so far, I’ve worked with a lot of people from former eastern block countries. Almost universally they preferred it under communism. Most had to leave home and move to another country because capitalism had so decimated their country. I’ve also lived in a “communist” country — China — though it’s not communist by any measure. China is more capitalist than the USA.

&gt; Your the privileged one thinking you know what going on cause you read some articles written by lying people.

This is a sad statement. Looking at your argument style and constant grammatical errors, I’m guessing you are not very educated. Or is English not your main language? If so, you’re doing well. Learning a new language is hard. Either way, your argument style show a lack of grounding in reason in logic.

Once races are mixed up, one does not have a corresponding relationship with the higher levels, and he has lost the root. Mixed races have lost their roots, as if nobody in the paradise will take care of them. They belong to nowhere, and no places would accept them. Therefore, you find the place where the continents of Europe and Asia meet a desert in the past and a depopulated zone. When the transportation means were not advanced, it was difficult to pass through it. With the progress of modern means, all these are broken through.

&gt; Acid Junkies is a dance act from The Netherlands. Live, they present themselves with a mix of solid techno music, played live and edited and enhanced with fragments of all kinds of dance music, spanning the last 20 years. From synthi-disco, via EBM towards house and techno.

&gt; The Acid Junkies started in 1992 as producer Stefan Robbers' solo project. It was his way of saying 'thanks' to all the originators from Chicago that injected such large doses of psychedelia into house music. The Part 1 EP on Eindhoven's famous Djax-Up-Beats label became an instant success and soon the Acid Junkies were a real band.

&gt; The first Acid Junkie is Stefan Robbers, one of the main artists responsible for turning the city of Eindhoven from Philips Light Bulb City into Techno City through his records as Terrace, Florence and REC and of course through his own Eevo Lute Muzique label.

&gt; His partner in crime for this operation is Harold de Kinderen, who provided Stefan with the Roland TB 303 he used for the first Acid Junkies EP and who has been a full band member since that day. Harold used to be a DJ for a drive-in show and played drums in various local bands. These days the band is assisted occasionally by Ronald Spanjers, who has by now earned the nickname ""third Acid Junkie"". 
With Harold the Acid Junkies became a regular band, one that also performs on stage. Night after night they direct the crowd from behind their piles of analogue synthesizers on stage. The Acid Junkies can play an audience like one of their synths and can bring the biggest cynic into full-blown ecstasy.

&gt; And so the Acid Junkies became known as one of the best live dance acts throughout the world, with one exception. In their native Holland they were virtually unknown until a couple of years ago, when finally the Dutch gave up their fascination with foreign techno and embraced the Acid Junkies. Since then, they do there what they have been doing all over the world: play. They have performed live shows at just about every major rave in Europe, like Germany¹s prestigious Mayday, as well as major Dutch festivals such as Noorderslag, Lowlands and Dance Valley. The band also conquered Chicago, where they shared the stage with their one-time heroes Roy Davis, Robert Armani and Woody McBride. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Posies is an American indie rock band, originally from Bellingham, WA., United States, although all band members had moved to Seattle when the band gained prominence. The band's two core members, singers, songwriters and guitarists are Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow.

&gt; The Posies began as a set of informal home recordings by Stringfellow and Auer, but soon became a full-fledged band. Those early demos were released as the album Failure (1988). Mike Musburger and Rick Roberts joined soon after, allowing the band to play its first live shows in Seattle and Bellingham. The four then moved into a house in Seattle's University District. The band's first full album was their major-label début Dear 23 (1990). It was produced by John Leckie and features lush orchestrations for the songwriters' literate, clever, melodic pop with occasional hard-hitting guitars.

&gt; The Posies' guitars hit even harder on their third and fourth albums, 1993's Frosting On The Beater and 1996's Amazing Disgrace. These two albums are the band's most succesful and are still widely regarded as classics in indie rock and 'power pop'. 

&gt; The band's rhythm section underwent many changes over the years. During the recording of 'Frosting', Roberts left and was replaced by Dave Fox. During the 1994 European tour, Musberger left (new bassist: Joe Howard a.k.a. Joe Skyward), whole Brian Young took over on drums 

&gt; 
The 'Amazing Disgrace line-up' also recorded album #5, Success (1998), which failed commercially. The Posies went on hiatus while the members concentrated on outside projects, including solo albums (Stringfellow, Auer) and projects such as Lucky Me, Skyward and Chariot, while Brian Young played drums in Fountains of Wayne. From 1997 to 2001, there was only sporadic Posies activity, although two live albums saw the light of day: an 'electric' one (Alive Before The Iceberg, 1999) and an 'acoustic' one (In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In, 2000).

&gt; After a satisfying tour as a duo, Auer and Stringfellow brought the band back to active service, now with Darius Minwalla on drums and Matt Harris on bass. The new line-up recorded and released the studio albums Every Kind Of Light (2005) and the particularly well-received Blood/Candy (2010).

&gt; From 1993 onwards, Auer and Stringfellow also joined Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens as band members of 'power pop' legends Big Star, playing on many tours as well as the Big Star studio album, In Space (2005). 

&gt; The years 2010-2016 were a particularly dark time for The Posies. Ayer and Stringfellow's association with Big Star came to an abrupt end when Alex Chilton died in 2010. The Posies' 2014 incarnation included Darius Minwalla on drums and Joe Skyward on bass, but disaster would strike: on May 21, 2015, Darius Minwalla died suddenly in his home in Vancouver, from unknown causes. On March 26th 2016, Joe Skyward passed away after a battle with cancer.

&gt; The Posies, however, re-emerged with a new album (their 8th), Solid States, set for an April 2016 release. Read more on Last.fm.

By 2025, NATO, while officially not dissolved, is pretty much made useless by removing certain articles - the reasons for this are many, but are mostly found in the growing Turkey-US-EU conflicts. Following the 2026 financial crisis triggered by another spike in oil and metal, the US turns inwards and NATO goes down with it. 

The EU, as the result of the mentioned crisis, splits in two, with only the western part of it being able to hold together and partly federalize around 2026. 

The East African Federation, finally agreed by the member states, is formed in the same year, becoming a voice that can no longer be ignored in African matters. 

Russian conflicts continue with both Turkey and Ukraine, with only the Ukrainian conflict bearing any fruits. However, the Russian economy was already in a bad shape and then...

In 2027, the ITER project in France obtains economically viable and more importantly, sustainable, nuclear fusion. The discovery is declared state secret, and is kept as one, as the US - or NAS by this point - is currently suffering from the political aftermath of the shortest civil wars of all time.

The results of this discovery- coupled with advancements made in battery-tech, slow spread of fusion power and the creation of several energy-storing networks, seems to lead to an Utopia: global warming by 2034 is all bit slowing down. 

Beneath the crust of this new world, however, great - not all good - changes have come. China, now named the New Republic, is under the control of the greate rcompanies who had removed the CCP from power, the Northern Americas are united under a US hegemony, and the New European Union is born and expanding, which is held together by radical implementation of meritocracy or by questionable voting restrictions, depending on whom you ask. The East African Federation is busy fighting European, Saudi and Chinese influence- so far, they have been successful. 

However, nations whose GDP depended on fossils have been the great losers of this new era. Even though fossils are still needed for manufacturing of materials, the breakthroughs in nanotechnology and the growing anti-fossil movements, often aided by mostly anti-Russian factions, ensured that the GDP of these nations practically halved over a decade. 

By 2037, tensions grew higher and higher. The NEU, half-united, could not even rely on its own chain of command, but still beared one of the most advanced armies in the world. They have, however, engaged in a military pact with the New Republic and India in case of an unprovoked attack on either of them. 

However, Russian military officers had severely underestimated the commitment of the parties involved in the pact, which led to the world being forever changed. 

So when the so called East War came, the winner was never a question: it was only the amount of bloodshed. 

With Moscow, Kiev and four other cities lost to nuclear weapons, the East War was a brutal conflict, barely lasting three days. Marked by the usage of heavy bomber drones and AI-led tactics, the East War was the end of an era, and a beginning of a new.

Russia was divided between the NEU and the New Republic - what was left was barely a remnant. The Middle East was now under Saudi and Indian influence, with Africa undergoing the Big Boom in the aftermath, with the Federation now being elevated into a major political power. Most of the Far East falls to the New Republic, and the NEU is already looking towards south. 

A lesser welcome change occured in South America - Brazil invaded a sizable portion of Argentina, and much of the continent is now locked in a bizzare three-way Cold War, where the NAS, reactivated on the global scale, is supporting its own factions.

Jusnaturalismo *de quem*? Existe uma dúzia. De Finnis certamente não. Nem de Cotta. De quem?

&gt; ""Raízes"" era uma palavra naquela frase, sabia?

Raízes nos gregos, **especialmente no stagirita**. Foi você quem trouxe o nome do Aristóteles, eu abri o Ética e mostrei que ele defende a proporcionalidade e a noção de equidade antes da noção de igualdade.

&gt; É engraçado qdo vc começa a se irritar e xingar as pessoas, como se vc fosse o dono da razão e tals.

Me mostra que você é o dono então, mostra aí que ""legislação"" é lei positiva e que ""lei"" é lei natural. Aliás, mesmo as leis naturais assumem também a forma de dispositivo normativo (""não causar dano ao inocente""), se está ou não positivada no ordenamento é outra discussão. Aí o nome correto é ""lei positiva"" mesmo. Você não pode usar a palavra no teu sentido privado que ninguém mais usa na doutrina e achar que vai existir diálogo -- pelo contrário, qualquer interlocutor informado vai te dizer que você tá usando palavras reservadas de forma equivocada.

&gt; Mostra aí então minha citação dizendo que Aristóteles defendia esse princípio especifico para justiça. Se eu realmente falei deve ser fácil achar

    Fun fact: Ela existe sim e, o mais engraçado, tem suas raízes nos gregos tbm (especialmente Aristóteles)

&gt; Ou pelo menos, o que ela deveria ser. Conceitualmente, a lei deveria ser justiça, pq é pra isso que ela foi criada

Lei é o conjunto normativo. A justiça é realizada no caso concreto segundo as fontes do direito, entre elas a exegese do texto da lei. A justiça se realiza também sobre costumes na ausência de texto legal. O Bastiat coitado deve estar se revirando no túmulo quando você faz a defesa legalista de que todos os veículos devem obedecer ao mesmo limite de velocidade ao invés de cada veículo poder trafegar na velocidade de segurança segundo suas próprias capacidades automobilísticas.

Act as shocked as you want; you are absolutely deluded if you think there is *more* violence, world-wide, as the result of ""atheists killing in the name of atheism"" than Religious people killing in the name of their religion. If you try to claim that, it is a blatant disregard for the truth, or a willful admission that you are irreconcilably biased.

&gt;So your telling me the belief that when you die NOTHING happens has absolutely nothing to do with mass murderers actually going through with it.

Absolutely. You're trying to assert that, somehow, the lack of belief in an afterlife makes an individual *more likely to commit violent crimes* out of some sense of ""escaping punishment""? That is a ridiculous, fallacious, and completely unsubstantiated claim. Religion, by an incredible margin, encourages more violence on a mass scale than any other organization - and that's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of **fact**, and here are numerous studies demonstrating that fact, if you're going to try to deny it:

I am so glad you brought that up! It is actually on my mind, some not aware about UNSW but some universities in UK confer that.

Out of the manuscripts under review, 2 are on composite structures and 1 on sandwich, I have 2 more planned in next few months. I was hoping to bring them together under a common theme Bio-inspired structures (as soon as they are Published) and send it to a univ which grants PhD by Publication.  I am not sure how many papers are needed to achieve PhD by Publications though.

It would certainly be beneficial as I will be able to justify my gap year.

Can you tell me more abt it? Will my PhD by Publication be seen equal as regular PhD ?  I mean even with a PhD I won't have any actual Research Lab kind of experience so,  How will that affect my chances for a Post-Doc?

Initially, I started off with Universities who accept without IELTS or any other exams, So I started off with Europe, Aus, NZ, even Canada to an extent.

I couldn't find any success in NZ and Can, and Aus is off due to visa. So I am left with UK and Europe. I read about PhD in US and the coursework and time attached with it and GRE/TOEFL exams and crossed it off.

Contrary to how many people think about history, it is not a list of sequential events liked by a web of cause-and-effect connections.

The challenge of writing a ""comprehensive"" history is whose standard of comprehensive would you be using? At what point does the discussion of a particular group's experiences get to check the box of being ""comprehensive""?

For example, does a comprehensive history of the US begin with the revolutionary war? Or does it begin with the first permanent European settlement? Or does it begin with Columbus reaching the New World? Or does it begin with the Native Americans who lives in what would be the United States for thousands of years before the modern country existed?

For another example, whose experiences should be emphasized in this ""comprehensive"" historical account? To continue with US history, how much time should we spend on the experiences of different groups at different periods? At what point have we talked enough about the experiences of Native Americans, individuals of African descent (both slave and free), the white aristocratic class, the white working class, British loyalists, men/women, and every else inbetween to say that we have written a complete account of Charleston, Virginia, between 1750-1800?

Now expand that out to the entire world for the entirety of human history.

This discussion of what to include in a ""comprehensive source"" leads us to the second quality you are asking for: a ""comprehensive"" source that is also ""unbiased"". It's a mistake to think there is a single history book anywhere in the world that is ""unbiased"". Every single text is influenced by the personal perspectives and biases of its author and the context in which it is created. All other things being equal, the writer at some point had to make a decision about whether to include X or Y in their writing, and their process for making that decision is influenced by what they see as important, i.e. their biases.

To refer to my Charleston example from above, the decision the author makes about which of those experiences to emphasize is the result of their personal biases and the way in which they interpret ""significance"".

Historical theory is a real thing. Do you subscribe to a Marxist view of history, i.e. (to simplify) that it is a series of conflicts between the haves and the have nots? Do you subscribe to Great Man history, i.e. that history is the result of decisions made by particular people in positions of power? How do you study a colonized people when the majority of written records were created *after* the colonial power arrived by the colonizers themselves? These questions need to be dealt with by the historian when they attempt to weave cohesive narratives.

Of course, bias in the way you're thinking of it does exist: just look at the inherent tension between some Soviet and contemporary American narratives of the Cold War; they read as propaganda rather than an exercise in ""unbiased"" narrative construction. So there are ""degrees"" of bias to be on the look out for.

As such, good historical investigation does not seek out ""unbiased"" souces (since they don't exist in the way most people envision), but rather recognizes the varieties of bias that exist, identify which are present in a given text, and work to reconcile the information and perspectives with other collected sources.

So it will be interesting to see what recommendations you get. You'll probably have more luck if you ask for histories of particular times and places than a recommendation based on the criteria you've currently set for yourself. In which case, you should justcheck the recommended reading list on this sub, as that information is already collected.

Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay bordering Syria said Friday. The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow. Stoltenberg ""urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region"", his spokesman said Friday.
In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general ""condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province"", according to the spokesman. Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding ""terrorists"" in Syria.
Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack. Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike.
In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's ""crimes against humanity"". The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month. There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail.
Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive. The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.
Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December. The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern that Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency. State news agency SANA acknowledged there were ""fierce clashes"" between the army and ""terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front"". A correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings.
The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December. The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb.
The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign. State media accused the ""terrorists"" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town.
It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey. Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees. Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees around 3.6 million people placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services. The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday that Ankara was not in a position to ""hold"" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more.
More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter. The Turkish president vowed Wednesday that Ankara would not take the ""smallest step back"" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to ""stop its attacks as soon as possible"" and to pull back by the end of the month.
The UN has repeatedly warned that the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011. Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib.

&gt;  
&gt;*Furthermore the rapid and intense arabization of somalis is a recent phenomenon arisen at the end of the civil war as such it has not always been integral to somali identity to attach itself to arabs and the absolute certainty that it will continue in this manner is unwarranted, as is generally your cynicism.*

I agree, good come back.

&gt;*Some of the most violent places on earth are also the most homogenous in terms of race, Somalia being a prominent example, therefore sameness can not neither guarantee prosperity or stability, additionally in the age of globalization more intermarriage is inevitable, even if found undesirable the trend would be difficult to reverse.*

Weakly argued. Fallacy here. I can tell this topic is not your forte. I won't be harsh. Let us move on.

&gt;*I see no coherent argument for the death penalty if our goal is a reduction in the crimes for which we apply it, certain crimes such as murder, rape or child molestation are not responsive to the penalty as the persons committing them do not consider the consequences before the act is done, it is in essence unnecessary if the goal was to reduce crime, if on the hand it is merely there to serve a thirst for vengeance then one has to question the motives for that view, is justice served if a society that abhors killing returns the act by killing?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The other pertinent objections is that we know of several cases, where innocent persons has been killed for crimes they did not commit, this raises the question of, would we rather punish 9 criminals but let 1 innocent person parish with them? The ethics of it is questionable to say the least.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“The findings demonstrate an overwhelming consensus among these criminologists that the empirical research conducted on the deterrence question strongly supports the conclusion that the death penalty does not add deterrent effects to those already achieved by long imprisonment.”*

Very poorly did here. Suppose some thug smacks you in the face would you hold back because of there isn't any evidence bla bla. I don't think so. You hit back hard. It is idiotic to resort to evidence you would agree. We can extend the same analogy to traffic offenses and whole host of criminal situations it would be a slippery slope. Capital punishment is a big deterrent, even if it weren't  it is a fitting punishment for capital crimes. Disregard the tricky cases, let us talk clear cut ones.

&gt;Veganism is not viable, we have to consume animals products  
&gt;  
&gt;This is manifestly false for the vast majority of humanity that has access to affordable plant products, all nutrients besides B12 can be found in plant products and in the litterateur what one finds is that some of the most healthy groups are those with a vegans/vegetarian diet, therefore the argument that is not viable due to some insufficiency does not hold water.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is however the issue of its practical application in a world that isn’t vegan friendly but with the increase in animals awareness it is becoming ever easier to commit to a vegan diet.

Nope. You can't find complete proteins in plants, nor real vitamin A, vitamin D and a whole host of the nutrients in any thing but animal products. Don't even try arguing with a former vegan.

&gt;By most metrics humans are living in a more peaceful, less poverty stricken with greater availability of goods and services, obviously things are far from perfect but humanity hasn’t seen as prosperous time as this as a collective community, before the industrial revolution life was even more bleak without workers rights, women’s rights, queer rights (you don’t believe in this but I had to mention since you know they are people who deserve to not be killed, imprisoned or discriminated), I recommend this Ted talk [https://youtu.be/Sm5xF-UYgdg](https://youtu.be/Sm5xF-UYgdg) to illustrate how wrong you are on the facts.

You've been brainwashed by the West. They have convinced non Westerners what is good for them is also good for you. That is a masterstroke of marketing. All those rights you mentioned apply to them not you. I can't even take you seriously here. Next.

&gt;Balkanizing Somali regions  
&gt;  
&gt;Though a unionist at heart I remain uncertain as to the best course for somalis, perhaps unity isn’t possible in the foreseeable future.

Somalis are hypocrites, their cognitive dissonance is breathtaking. How can you claim to want to be in a nation with a clan you want to wipe out. Every village and clan in Somalia harbors genocidal fantasies for the next clan yet wanna sing kumbaya. We should stop be sentimental and smell the leaves.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/iran-is-complying-with-nuclear-deal-restrictions-iaea-report-idUSKCN1LF1KR

The report that was released by the IAEA in 2018 literally said that Iran was compliant. 

&gt;By putting sanctions back on, and crippling their economy, we severely limit their ability to fund these massive military destabilization campaigns.

Yet Iran has now resumed their nuclear development. That's better though, right?

&gt;Those ""injuries"" were called concussions (of course you'd use the phrase ""traumatic brain injury"") - and several of those injuries resulted in those individuals returning to work just a few days later.

If they were so trivial, why did Trump straight up lie at first and say there were no injuries? Why did he try to downplay concussions as 'headaches'?

&gt;All told, we got rid of an extremely high value military target (who was a terrorist, again, read the Democratic congress woman's comments) with relatively little escalation.

Iran also got away with attacking bases housing US forces with no retaliation. So essentially propagating the status quo while needlessly escalating tensions achieves what exactly?

&gt;The articles frequently reference a history of violating the deal, including one article which says they violated the heavy water provisions mere months after signing it.

Refer above, or you know, to this quote from IAEA regarding the incident in 2016:

&gt;“It’s important to note that Iran made no effort to hide this, hide what it was doing from the IAEA,” spokesman Mark Toner said.

The fact remains that the IAEA overall deemed Iran to be compliant, so what's your next argument?

&gt;Saying ""the IAEA consistently said that Iran was abiding by it"" is wrong - the IAEA is sourced in the articles as saying Iran was constantly in violation of the agreement. Again, your ignorance is no excuse here as I've sourced my sources.

Where is this source? Here's an actual source from 2019:

&gt;**In its report on May 31, the agency said the IAEA found Iran had stayed within key limitations spelled out in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.**

&gt;The fresh IAEA quarterly report, however, found Iran continued to comply with the JCPOA and said its inspectors had been given unfettered access to Iranian nuclear facilities.

&gt;""Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the additional protocol and enhances confidence,"" the report stated, referring to the procedure detailing safeguards and tools for verification.

&gt;According to the IAEA report, Iran's heavy water stockpile rose from 124.8 tons in February to 125.2 tons as of May 26. That’s still below the 130-ton limit.

&gt;Its stock of low-enriched uranium was 174.1 kilograms as of May 20, up from 163.8 kilograms in February, the IAEA found. The limit set out by the JCPOA is 202.8 kilograms.

&gt;It added that Iran had not enriched any uranium above the level allowed by the JCPOA.

&gt;""All centrifuges and associated infrastructure in storage have remained under continuous agency monitoring,"" the IAEA said.

https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/19/06/gov2019-21.pdf

This is the actual report from IAEA from 31 May 2019. Why do you insist on spreading false information?

&gt;Trump at least is tough on foreign adversaries. Despite crossing Obama's red line with chemical weapons, he did nothing in response. Trump bombed Russian airfields in Syria.

Does tough mean praising Putin, Kim Jong-un, Erdogan or MBS?

Also, Trump bombing Russian airfields contradicts his platform of less foreign intervention. Didn't you Trump supporters accuse Hillary of being too much of a war hawk against Russia? Where's the consistency?

&gt;Obama made some bad decisions, and in my opinion (supported by my list of articles which you ignored), the Iran nuclear deal was one of them.

How much does your opinion compare to IAEA reports that Iran was compliant with the deal or that the EU supported said deal?

&gt;You can disagree or not, but stop pretending that position has no objective factual backing.

There really isn't. Trump's administration themselves admitted that they assassinated Solemani under a false pretext.

Also, the contradiction is real - even if Iran has caused more chaos in Yemen and Syria, why do you care? Hasn't Trump already promised less foreign intervention?

Manchester United spent the last day of the transfer window scrabbling around trying to sign a striker, finally landing on Odion Ighalo. And the club are determined not to have a repeat of their seemingly occasional haphazard approach to signings by hiring a team of eight to help identify talent through the use of data.

Led by a head of analytics, the new department will use data to profile potential targets, as well as contribute to United’s academy and medical teams. United do use analysis at the moment, particularly video, but are surprisingly a little behind other leading clubs when it comes to data in recruitment, instead paying big money for high-profile players. So the move is a positive step forward.

The club hired a headhunter to approach candidates, who all had to sign non-disclosure agreements before entering into talks. Some of those candidates are now at the second stage of interview.

The decision to hire this team should also help United catch up with rivals such as Liverpool and Manchester City. Liverpool’s analytics work is the most advanced in the Premier League, with the head of department Ian Graham talking regularly to Jurgen Klopp and sporting director Michael Edwards. Leicester hired someone in a similar role at Brendan Rodgers’ request. But some insiders at United are concerned the new department will not get the influence it needs and instead be placed alongside the club’s scouts, some of whom feel they are not listened to enough.

Finding better value in the transfer market could be crucial for United at a time when their finances are not as healthy as in previous years and with the possibility of no Champions League football again next season.

**United Adidas losses are staggered** :

Progress in the Europa League and a stable position in the Premier League — notwithstanding the outcome of Manchester City’s appeal against their European ban — means Manchester United still have two plausible routes to qualify for next season’s Champions League, and everyone at the club is working towards that goal.

But even if they fail, the penalty clauses in their agreement with sponsors Adidas are not as pointed as has been previously thought, my colleague Laurie Whitwell understands.

Adidas, United’s kit manufacturers, agreed a 30 per cent cut in their annual £75million commitment if the club have two successive seasons out of the Champions League. That would equate to £22.5million, no small loss even for a club which reported revenues of £627million last year.

But the structure of United’s deal with Adidas means that reduction does not come all at once. It would be spread over the remaining five seasons of the 10-year contract agreed in 2015, resulting in United receiving £4.5million a year less from Adidas.

Under accounting rules, United can also report it at a reduced value for the entire life of the 10-year deal, equating to £2.3million less a year. So United would back-date the deficit by recognising a cumulative catch-up of five lots of £2.3million in the 2019-20 accounts (roughly £11.5million) and then £2.3m less annually in each of the remaining five years of the deal.

The aim remains to make it an academic debate by returning to Europe’s elite club competition. But perhaps it is not as dramatic a loss regarding United’s summer transfer plans as has been proposed.

There is also, incidentally, a performance-related clause in United’s deal with shirt sponsors Chevrolet, but this relates to relegation from the Premier League. And even then it would take two seasons in the Championship for the reduction to kick in.",True,False,False,,,0,1583135151,,False,0,{},fj979kk,True,t3_fc8p4y,False,False,t3_fc8p4y,/r/reddevils/comments/fc8p4y/david_ornstein_and_laurie_whitwell_with_the/fj979kk/,False,,1591000692,74,True,False,reddevils,t5_2rxse,r/reddevils,public,0,[],"[{'a': ':NewtonHeath:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/1kwqt3bxdhf11_t5_2rxse/NewtonHeath'}]",richtext,False,False,,

If it seems radical, I think the following two graphs are clarifying. The first is the distribution of wealth in the US v. in Western Europe. The second is the evolution of the share of the national income of the top 1% v. the bottom 50% over the past four decades. Bernie's tax plan does not represent some socialist hellscape for folks with money. It would simply be a return to a more equitable distribution that this country has achieved in its recent past and that Western Europe enjoys now.

[Wealth distribution in Europe v. US](https://imgur.com/itGOYsR)

[Share of income bottom 50% v top 1%](https://imgur.com/undefined)

1) **Cost of Medicare for All** One of the things that isn't talked about enough, in my opinion, is how much money Medicare For All will save us. Single-payer allows the govt to be the sole negotiator of drug prices. That will bring down costs drastically, sometimes [by as much as 200-500%](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA98uUGWwAAue88.jpg). Also, [opening the market to drugs manufactured in Canada and elsewhere](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/12/cory-booker-joins-senate-republicans-to-kill-measure-to-import-cheaper-medicine-from-canada/), as Bernie proposed in a bill he co-authored with Amy Klobuchar last year, will bring down costs. Thirdly, administrative costs in the US health care system dwarf those of other countries. We pay more than [five times per capita what Canada does](https://time.com/5759972/health-care-administrative-costs/) in such costs, for example, which isn't surprising when you realize how much bureaucratic waste goes into billing and bill-collecting. Medicare's administrative costs are much lower than those of the private sector, so a shift to M4A would save tons of money there.

2) **Eliminating student debt** I suppose this all depends on your attitude in life in general. My parents worked their asses off, delayed retirement, and abstained from taking any vacations for over a decade so that my brothers and I could go to college. I worked summer and part-time jobs, and I still had over $40,000 of student debt at ~6-8% interest. I lived like a Spartan for 5 years and paid them off early. Personally, I do feel a bit cheated. I'm sure my mom and dad do, too, though they'd never admit it. And I'm one of the lucky ones because my parents had well-paying middle class jobs, my debt load was relatively small, and I got a good enough job out of school to pay things down pretty quickly. Still, everything in the balance the question is this: Do I think families should have to make such sacrifices just to send their kids to college for four years and receive a paper that, in our gutted, union-bereft economy, is practically a minimum requirement for existence? Of course not. I don't think my parents should've had to sacrifice vacation and retirement for me like that. I also sometimes think about what I would have now if I was able to invest that $40,000 instead of sink it into loan repayments. 

But like I said, I'm lucky compared to most. I have friends that graduated with double or triple the debt that I had and because the interest rates are so ungodly high, even with decent salaries eight years later they've barely made a dent in the principle. This is preventing them from buying homes, getting married, and starting families. It's money that they would otherwise be injecting into the economy, but is instead getting sucked up by the financial industry. 

It is also worth noting that [minorities, especially minority women](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/the-disproportionate-burden-of-student-loan-debt-on-minorities/392456/) are disproportionately burdened by student loan debt. Student debt forgiveness would effectively be an injection of capital into minority neighborhoods, granting millions of people the financial freedom to start their own businesses and revitalize their local economies.

1) is strong on illegal immigration

2) wants to reduce business tax in general. It’s already 39%, and I think any additional increase will reduce salaries significantly. It’s not like the business will just “eat” the extra tax burden. It’s passed through. And the employees suffer. And reduced tax is always good for small, family owned businesses. 

3) isn’t a left-winger, regarding gun control. Still not good. But definitely not bad to the level of a liberal. 

4) strong protectionism on foreign trade. This obviously protects the interest of the US and the interests of US businesses. And brings back some tax money when companies are forced to come back home. And exports go up, instead of imports going up. Export economies are MUCH better than import economies. 

5) is a political outsider, and willing to say what other politicians are thinking, but not willing to say out loud. It amazes me that people don’t think that other politicians don’t have just as bad of a mouth as trump. They absolutely do, they just don’t post that shit on Twitter. 

Sanders:

1) extreme taxes

2) anti-gun, and not even using logic. 100% standard liberal emotional arguments. I’m against gun control, but I’m absolutely willing to have that discussion with anti-gunners, IF they are attempting to use logic to back their point. These emotional arguments often just absolutely BLOW my MIND with the level of ignorance of firearms, and assumptions that are plain wrong. Like how plenty of liberal politicians would tell you that “high capacity machine gun ghost guns” are totally legal and you could go pick one up without a background check. Machine guns are illegal without going to EXTREME financial and legal lengths to get one, ghost guns are not really a common thing, although legal. Not that it matters. And almost EVERY SINGLE gun transaction in this country has a background check. And those are just a few examples of things that are assumed legal by ignorant politicians that have literally no idea what they are talking about, and are just playing to people’s emotions and knee-jerk reactions to crime. 

3) wants more corporate taxes, and regulation on the pharmaceutical industries (let me explain on this one. I am a pharmacy tech. I see every day how much people struggle to pay for drugs. BUT: that problem doesn’t really apply to genetics. They are cheap. REALLY cheap a lot of the time. And equally effective, by law, to brand drugs. My main problem with pricing regulation is this: the United States creates something like 90-95% of new and experimental drugs in the world. Without gigantic profit margins, pharmaceutical companies won’t have any incentive to keep that going. And I don’t want to see the entire pharmaceutical industry go stagnant, and have no new drugs being created for the benefit of all of us)

4) is on-board with all the “Woke” stuff that is extremely annoying and a non-issue to everyone but a very VERY loud, small, group. 

5) open/less restricted borders. It’s not like border control is one of those “look how far the US is behind Europe!” Things.

Many other things not on this list were also known. They were also discussed amongst people outside of the UK as possible impacts.

I'll give you that the UK education system neglects informing about the EU, but it still leaves responsibility on the remain camp.

Just a few hitchhiking kilometers away from Tivat airport sits Kotor in the equally named bay. The small historic town offers beautiful little alleyways, with beautiful facades, a very international mix of travelers and some great hostels to stay, some even with their own pool.

A great activity is to climb the mountain right behind the city in the morning when it's not yet too hot. It takes about an hour and you can follow the trail on the left side leading through a hole in the wall up in order not having to pay entrance fee which applies on the other route.

My hostel also offered bay cruises, super scenic mountain top barbeques and evening activities.

Also around the bay are some other beautiful little towns such as Perast and Tivat, all right by the bay.

A place highly recommended for travel that can also be combined with a trip to Albania for example.

Some pros from back then are still around in the OWL. The game wouldn't launch until mid-2016. Events were being set up without Blizz's involvement. 2016 OW was thriving, and APAX was seeing westerners in korea like early OGN for LoL had.

So Blizzard flat out said that anyone that was already involved in an existing league might not be eligible to play in their upcoming Official, Dev-Sanctioned League, and that everyone should clear their schedules and contracts for it. And then sat for a full year without giving any details. The only info of what would became the OWL were rumours and unofficial talk with blizz employees or org owners that had been contacted to buy slots in an american locked franchise.

A full year passed. Every online weekly event dried out while the pro teams didn't dare sign up, every offline event had to enforce blizzard's rulesets (notoriously, map bans had been a thing since early overwatch but blizz blocked them because then tournament play was too different from casual play and they wanted the scene to be a showcase of the game) and were basically reduced to the asian scenes because OGN and the chinese event organisers were commited to making this work, so APEX and APAC kept trucking. Every european team disbanded, had its players go back to work/studies, or was contacted one person at a time by american orgs that had bought slots.

And then came he official announcements. OWL would be a year-long league, only in the states, with no promotion whatsoever from parallel circuits or tier 2, orgs that had bought a spot would rebrand on the city team system just for OWL.

So everyone went home because they were really tired. The OWL launched with decent numbers but it turns out you can't atract a new audience with an esports stream that already requires a ton of knowledge about the game to follow, and there is no pretension of your team of talented up-and-comings ever making it pro bc you won't get to go to events or play against a pro team, the most anyone can aspire to is getting poached from Contenders or ladder. And the numbers spiraled down, and OWL revised their growth expectations for S2 and again for S3, and the big name talent gathered from other esports left.

- ""Why do refugees leave their country instead of fighting for its freedom and culture...""

First, keep in mind this is a civil war, it's not an invade by a foreign nation, it's a civil war, who are they supposed to fight against in such a situation? who decides if they are wrong or not, should they go and fight against some guy just like they do on the other end of the battle? one of them will end up kill the other, which won't change anything and won't stop the war in any way, but the country just lost one man who could've contributed to its future in better ways than holding a rifle. what saddens me the most is almost all of the people asking why they're staying and fighting don't know anything about the situation in Syria, and never experienced what bad a war can be, specifically a civil one.

- ""You are coming in mass numbers, you're backwards and will commit many crimes...""

Yup, many people come in mass numbers, but they won't commit crimes, why do you think all these people are criminals? if in Syria, where the judicial and executive branches are well corrupted, and poverty is wide spread, crime wasn't common at all, so why exactly would these people have a change of heart in a more welcoming and safe country?

- ""We should kick you away because you're invaders and will ruin our continent...""

Nope, you shouldn't. First of all you're kicking human beings, not dolls or rocks. Secondly, you fear these people will invade your continent with Islam and backward traditions, while the truth is, returning them back to Syria, or somewhere on the borders will be the best thing ISIS dream of, these people will have to provide to their families and are more vulnerable to radicalization in such a situation, so basically you're providing manpower to ISIS, deny an entire generation of children from school, a generation that will be the new manpower ISIS relying on in the next 10 years, so no, if you're really concerned about Europe and fear ISIS, then you should keep these people.

- ""Why do people want to leave Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria even though it's quite safe there?""

Because they want a better life, I know it's such a bad excuse but that's reality, and I think western Europe should take them, not to fulfill their dreams, but to ease the burden on these countries, which can't possibly manage such huge floods of people, specially in their current economic environment.",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,0,1583142600,,1583142939,0,{},fj9cvam,False,t3_fby09c,False,True,t3_fby09c,/r/europe/comments/fby09c/euturkey_border_crisis_megathread/fj9cvam/,False,,1591003363,-23,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,[],"[{'e': 'text', 't': '🇸🇮/🇭🇷'}]",richtext,False,False,,

Several wikis relating to the game are excellent resources. Why do you think they are awful?

It took me less than 30 seconds to find out exactly what the red pins indicated after reading your post (I didn't know exactly myself), but used a different google search which led me to this page: https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Dictionary_of_Icons Which is extremely useful, I've ended up there many times before for other reasons (so should probably bookmark it). They are ""landmarks"". This was the first google result for both ""ffxiv map legend"" and ""ffxiv map icon"".

The weird thing was, for me, the search term you used ""map red pins ffxiv"" returned the exact definition as the fourth result, and the page linked about which also contained this information as the fifth result. The fourth result even had the definition in the google blurb for it. This feels a little like you're being a bit lazy and not scanning past the first couple of results and are blaming it on other people not catering to your needs better!

The cherry blossoms and music is almost certainly related to the current event, Little Ladies' Day 2020 (https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/2020/Little_Ladies_Day/ )The image on that page, which I think you also see when you log in at the moment, features cherry blossoms, so I'm guessing they're related.

But some of those who are trying to pass to EU might be unregistered immigrants or people who entered Turkey directly with their passports who doesn't have access to these aids. They can be from Syria but also from Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkmenistan, Lebanon even Central Africa...

Not all immigrants escaped from war at the borders of Syria and received de-facto refugee status. Some escaped from poverty and danger in overall Middle East scheme of things.

At least in footage from Edirne, there is also a male majority.

Some of them are probably aware situation in Turkey is not very sustainable. So they want to be accepted in a place with higher life standards and higher chance of sustain said standards. Where they can bring their families later on.

Some of them do work in Turkey but they can make at least thrice the money for same job in EU and send part of it to their families in Turkey or other places.

AFAIK their life standards in Turkey is in a very large gradient. I don't know the main factors determining these but some people are in camps yet some people are doing just fine.

Lovely rhetoric. I am impressed with the genial mixture of bonhomie and contemptuous dismissal. What I notice is a complete lack of evidence for the claims. Which is fine. I do love an evidence free policy. Which is why I voted for Brexit and for renewed Conservative Government. I am so committed to evidence free policy that I am simply going to flip a coin to determine if I believe each of your critiques.

Meanwhile EU growth has been shit for many years, to the extent that the EU is a shrinking economic force on the world stage compared to China/the US.

Heads you win. Again. What are the odds - 4/3, in fact. The odds of you winning again are going to be 8/7 - so these delusions are going to need to be absolutely top notch. I have to pretend that I did not say ""collapse"" and pretend that all I mentioned was GDP Growth Rate. Then I have to ignore the World Bank Figures which place 23 countries ahead of the US for Growth - 14 being European. So these are now irrelevant. We are Making America Grate Again.

&gt; The US has monetary union without fiscal union? You'll have to cite a source for that one mate. You may find it hard, after all surely you've heard of the US federal budget, paid for by federal taxes, spent by the federal government, right?

Heads again! What an extraordinary turn of events. Unprecedented in history! An 80/5 bet would have had you bringing home a small pre-sliced packet of pork product. Perhaps not the bacon but definitely something cookable. I have to pretend that the red herring of institutional organisation actually has some significance. Not sure how I am going to do it. But at these odds, I really do have to do it.

&gt; I get the impression you know nothing about this, but you really should. You're really showing your ignorance here.

Heads again! This is getting fascinating. I mean I am obviously too dumb to understand epidemiology so I should be utterly content free on the nature of word juggling and word salad in economics. But onwards: I really am showing my ignorance. The use of the Dollar as the currency of settlement for, for example, Oil no longer has any bearing on fiscal *whatever it was* because that would spoil your winning streak on the coin toss. The odds are now 160/5. The winnings on  this are going to be so sweet. You should put more down on it. Pay the tax first and walk away with your winnings... No? Onwards it is then.

&gt; Clearly not the UK though, our exports to the US increase every year.

You guessed it: heads again. 128/1 and you are winning big. This is heading towards retirement funds. You are on £128,000 profit here. Just for being right. I feel utterly foolish.

&gt; The thing with the UK's exports to the EU, is that 40% are indeed made up of financial and business services, which while quota/tariff free, aren't under single market regulation already today.

I am feeling resigned now. Of course it was heads. Of course you are now walking away with winnings into the millions. I feel so foolish to have doubted you. Women are throwing themselves at your feet. How could I have failed to notice that financial passporting was outside of single market regulation. That is a schoolboy error. I should be ashamed of myself. No: I am ashamed.

&gt; The EU can of course quota/tariff these services, but if they do they must tariff/quota the same services from any other WTO trading nation too. And the only other nations that offer these services (HK,NY) all trade with the EU on WTO terms already. It's like Germany tariffing an essential part it must buy in order to build cars: They can do it sure, and maybe it will help grow a local supplier for that part, but it will make their cars more expensive on the world market for a while at least, potentially forever if a decent local supplier never emerges.

Oops: Tails. You lost everything. All those millions you were going to win: gone. Let me introduce you to something called the sunk cost fallacy. A sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future. Which is in sharp contrast to the future value of money. You seem to have the cognitive dissonance that goes along with the Sunk Cost Fallacy. 

Which is fine. We all do. Even the ones calculating the odds rather than the probabilities. 

&gt; It's like Germany tariffing an essential part it must buy in order to build cars: They can do it sure, and maybe it will help grow a local supplier for that part, but it will make their cars more expensive on the world market for a while at least, potentially forever if a decent local supplier never emerges.

This is the bit I like the most. It is the understated threat. The idea that Germany would never innovate to avoid needing an essential part and then tariff to eliminate that part from the supply chain. It is as though the EU or Member States have  no relationship to Industrial Strategy. You know, the EU is not a Free Trade Area comprising the second largest economy on the planet - between the USA and China. I suppose I should buy into that. It is a lovely delusion that gives the UK (six in global economic terms - down from five when it was a member of the EU - and *hold my beer!* the EU would actually be the World's Largest Economy if the UK had not left. Instead it needs to grow by about 12% to be number one. The UK, in contrast needs to grow by 87% to be number one.

I may be fickle and all that - but I can see the advantage of tying my fortunes to the EU. All that Financial Passporting would be a huge advantage. It really would. But let's not dwell on delusions. The UK needs to took up for 87% Growth.

The thing about epidemiology is that this:

&gt; 87,694 Cases and 2,995 Deaths out of 7,794,798,739 People might well be a pandemic but it is not as impressive as Seasonal flu which kills 291,000 to 646,000 people worldwide each year.

Will never age well. Science has a feedback loop that updates the data on a regular basis. Today that paragraph would need to read

*89,081 Cases and 3,037 Deaths out of 7,768,117,949 People might well be a pandemic but it is not as impressive as Seasonal flu which kills 291,000 to 646,000 people worldwide each year.*

It might even be sensible to include the 69,325 deaths today from all causes. Which puts a perspective on the 42 deaths today from coronavirus. The population growth this year is c. 13.6m so coronavirus is not wiping out the human species. But it is lovely and vivid and a great way to ramp up the sunk cost fallacy across all sorts of things.

China is communist only in name because communism has a positive connotation in China. It's authoritarian state-capitalist and has many billionaires. It's going to be a huge threat in the upcoming era because it will use authoritarian and capitalist principles to commit economic terrorism/imperialism abroad and will continue to commit Orweillian offenses domestically.

Despite what some people might think, the U.S. isn't some antithesis to China in terms of its economic and political institutions. Just like how China likes to flavor itself communist, the U.S. likes to flavor itself capitalist and democratic. That's certainly true to some extent, but like China, it's built on mixed principles from various economic and political philosophies. Social Security, food stamps, public roads, subsidies, bailouts, and such are all rooted from socialist philosophies, yet the word socialism triggers something much more devious from the days of the Cold War in the minds of many in this country. Capitalism is thought of being synonymous with freedom, yet unfettered capitalism has done much damage to the economic and political well being of modern U.S. Deregulation, repeal of the fairness doctrine, Citizens United, and the list goes on; these ills borne of some delusional view of capitalism will have the U.S. descend into a plague of authoritarian capitalism, and words such as socialism have lost their meaning. Trump &amp; Bloomberg both represent what this means: nearly unlimited wealth and power having a chokehold on the Consitution, courts, Congress, economic institutions, educational institutions, media, and so on.

'Democratic Socialism,' or more accurately described as Social Democracy (which is to the right of Democratic Socialism) based on Sanders' platform, is a key part of what made EU largely successful in the modern era: a capitalism-based system with enough welfare &amp; taxation policies rooted in socialism in place to keep things fair and not out-of-control. In the U.S. we are seeing the results of generations of inherited wealth, poorly regulated industries, and low taxation for decades: a downward spiral of income inequality, cognitive dissonance, misery, and chaos. The U.S. was once a Social Democratic nation post-WWII with policies of the New Deal enacted; for example, the highest marginal tax rate was 91% and college was nearly free. It was in part due to such policies that the U.S. was able to keep wealth from conglomerating and the top and allow the average citizen to prosper.

Capitalism is a good start. I don't hate it because I believe people should have a right to better their own lives with diligence, but that is not mutually exclusive with heavily regulating capitalist forces on the large-scale. Capitalism at the top cannot be as dominant as it has been, especially in the 21st Century with how much access to power wealth can provide. If the U.S. were to be serious about solving its problems, it would start to adopt Sanders' platform ***at a minimum*** to catch up with the rest of the developed world.",True,False,False,,,0,1583145062,,False,0,{'gid_1': 1},fj9eo0i,False,t3_fc10mx,False,True,t3_fc10mx,/r/politics/comments/fc10mx/the_real_global_threat_to_21st_century_freedom_is/fj9eo0i/,False,,1591004206,1,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,r/politics,public,1,[],[],text,False,False,,

&gt;I can already tell this is going to be a good one with assumptions on tone like that.


You're the one that started calling out for fear mongers while spreading misinformation. 


&gt;So you mean just like every other regional strain of the flu or flu like virus that the majority of counties deal with annually?

Remind me when a seasonal flu has threatened to overwhelm the health system with the sheer number of cases needing hospitalization? And the source for this will be in the part about mortality rate, don't worry.

&gt;So the entire world is only Asia, EU, and the US. More failed hyperbole and scare tactics. I'm very sorry you blindly believe the media scares. I'd really suggest doing your own research on this topic.

Don't twist my words, you started out saying that not most of the world was affected, I corrected you on it. Also here politicians are trying to tone it down, don't know what kind of politicians you have there that try to scare people.

&gt;We're around 54 cases, which are all quarantined to hospitals with no sign of any sort of spreading as per New York times as of Tuesday the 25th. Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-us.html

You've just got it and every country that is currently affected started out like this.

&gt;2% is incredibly low when we consider the main people who have been killed are elderly/older populace, those whom already have sicknesses or medical problems (As per the only person to die in the US from this already having medical complications), and young children who aren't able to get care or already have other medical problems.
Even then, I'm gonna need a citation on 2% and a breakdown of that number to show overall mortality rate vs age groups for it to actually mean something behind a simple percent designed to instill fear.

The victims were not only elderly and sick people as your politicians are trying to spoon feed you, here's an example
https://women.ncr-iran.org/2020/02/27/covid-19-infection-kills-national-futsal-player-elham-sheikhi-in-qom/

And as for the mortality rate
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/


&gt;That's an awfully odd way to tell someone their wrong when they posted this exact statement.

​I was quoting you, if you bothered to read what I wrote right after you would have seen I was correcting you.

&gt;That's an awfully odd way to tell someone their wrong when they posted this exact statement.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/


&gt;Oh, so now you're saying it's even less scary than I had even implied?

​ No, I'm saying you're spreading misinformation


&gt;Did I ever imply they didn't?

Yes you did by saying that there shouldn't be such measures because in your opinion it affects only them


&gt; I don't think anyone was arguing that survivors don't have stories to tell. I know I sure didn't say or imply this.

I wrote victims. You argued that survivors had stories to tell. Two different things. I linked above about the healthy and young victims.


&gt; According to this article, it's very clearly not as bad as you're implying. Only 1 of 20 regions is hit hard in Italy, and even then it's a much smaller area than that whole ""region"" being affected. It's to the point where they're even telling people it's still safe to travel to Italy. Guess it isn't as problematic as you're suggesting if the overwhelming majority of Italy is still safe to visit.

That article is very outdated. Let me educate you since I live there. The number of cases is over 1700 now and it has spread from here to 14 different countries. The majority of the regions have closed schools, museums and so on. The soccer laguea has been nearly stopped. Many countries have stopped accepting tourists from Italy and are recommending not to come here, USA included as Trump brought the threat level of our country to level 4.

But of course you won't know of this if you keep checking articles outdated by two weeks and clearly one-sided. You are repeating what Trump has said on that and he's not the most trustworthy source on scientifical matters either.

As long as I suggest an OEM key and not a stolen key that should be no problem then?

&gt;They are stolen volume license agreement keys that the sellers have no legal right to sell anyway.

Generally, you don't know that for certain. It is only illegal, if the buyer knows certainly that the key is stolen. If the seller claims the key to be an OEM key, the buyer can assume the key to be legitimate (as long as there are no other indicators for a stolen key, e.g. price; but OEM Windows key generally go for \~10€ so even if it's a cheap one for a couple bucks that's not suspiciously cheap).

&gt;The ruling also specifies that in the case of a business that has purchased more licenses than they end up needing from a volume agreement, the business is not entitled to sell only that portion of the generated license keys.

That's correct, but the ruling only applies to the seller, paragraph 69:

&gt;\[...\] If the licence acquired by the first acquirer relates to a greater number of users than he needs \[...\] the acquirer is not authorised \[...\] to divide the licence and resell only the user right for the computer program concerned corresponding to a number of users determined by him.

As a private individual we can assume, that a big company selling those OEM keys adheres to this ruling. IANAL, but if I interpret this correctly, this is for the case if one key is applicable to multiple users (paragraph 22-24: One key is for 25 users, if you have 27 users you will need two keys). However, for Windows it's 1 key = 1 user. Even if the interpretation is wrong and this is not the case, my first statement still applies.

In the end the conclusion still is (paragraph 89.2):

&gt;Articles 4(2) and 5(1) of Directive 2009/24 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of the resale of a user licence entailing the resale of a copy of a computer program downloaded from the copyright holder’s website, that licence having originally been granted by that rightholder to the first acquirer for an unlimited period in return for payment of a fee \[...\], the second acquirer of the licence, as well as any subsequent acquirer of it, \[...\] \[are\] regarded as lawful acquirers of a copy of a computer program within the meaning of Article 5(1) of that directive \[...\].

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I will do what I did before: Don't include a copy of Windows if the user is from the EU, but tell him/her how the parts list can be modified to make room for the $100 Windows key (or include the key and tell him/her how the build can be modified with extra $100). Additionally, cite this ruling, but neither interpret it, nor suggest to buy such an OEM key, so he/she can decide for themself what to do. I think the wording is quite clear for everyone from the EU.

Also, there are many other ways to get a legitimate key, e.g. an Edu key from uni, subsidised keys from corporate benefits, using an old Windows 7 key, etc.",True,False,False,,,0,1583148170,,1583149373,0,{},fj9h3nd,False,t3_fb432g,False,False,t1_fj7xacr,/r/buildapcforme/comments/fb432g/mod_reminder_rules_regarding_grey_market_software/fj9h3nd/,False,,1591005361,10,True,False,buildapcforme,t5_2tjcr,r/buildapcforme,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,,

The availability of jobs in Switzerland, especially for third-country nationals, is not good. 

Switzerland is one of the highest paying and therefore most sought after countries in the world and employers here have access to the labour market from the EU/EFTA. 

What's more, Swiss employers legally required to give priority to European applicants. For you to get a job here, your employer has to be able to prove that it can't get someone similarly qualified from the local market. 

Your best options, realistically, are:

-	Get a job at an international company that has an office in both Switzerland and the US, work there a few years and then transfer. Your knowledge of the company and things specific to the company can be treated as a ""qualification"" that your employer can't get elsewhere. 
-	Move to Germany, stay until you get citizenship and then move to Switzerland. 

Keep in mind that a degree isn't usually enough from an immigration perspective, you also need several years of work experience. 

&gt;	German

Beware that Swiss in the German region generally speak Swiss German rather than High German. High German is however used in schools and written form so Swiss can still use it.

&gt;	but I also am concerned that the Juris Doctorate I’ll receive when I finish my schooling in the U.S. will, immigration-wise, be worth zilch over there

From an immigration perspective, a degree and some work experience is enough. 

From an employment perspective, a US law degree will be worth substantially less than in the US, as a US law degree will not allow you to practice law in Switzerland. 

&gt;	Will she need to learn German as well, and are her skills/degree more transferrable than mine?

Yes, she'll need to learn German, as everyone else she works with will speak German.

Not a significant percentage and they had no motivation to move to west german territory, as they would have been prosecuted there as well (today germans still prosecute camp guards who managed to hide and discovered).

Thats just not true. Most of these Nazis were never in front of a court, nor in a prison. Most of them even hold their old jobs and worked until they couldn't.

Lisa Nandy makes the following arresting claim this morning:

“The choice was made by the Blair government that cities were the engines of growth with the hope that the benefits would trickle out to surrounding towns. They haven’t.”

Is this true? I’m not convinced. The biggest problem is that Nandy is wrong to say that the benefits of regenerating cities have failed to translate to their neighbouring towns. It’s a narrative that struggles to explain the growing economies of, among other places, Slough, Reading, Crawley and Margate. Of course, what all those three towns have in common is that they are satellite towns of London.

What hasn’t happened, for the most part – though there are important exceptions to this story, too – is that the towns surrounding the United Kingdom’s other great cities have not experienced the same benefits as those surrounding London.  

But that isn’t because the model of city-led economic growth has failed Wigan but worked for Manchester. It’s because, as Tom Forth has shown, outside of London, the United Kingdom has some of the least economically productive cities in Europe. There hasn’t been sufficient growth from Manchester to “trickle out” to its neighbouring towns. The problem is that not enough has been done for Manchester – and that until that changes the UK won’t get the same benefits that it does from London from any of its other towns. Don’t forget that even if you live in a flourishing town or city, the problems of struggling towns and cities are very much your own, because the housing crisis of London is in part an outgrowth of the jobs crisis outside of it. 

Why does that matter? Well, because there is a lively debate within the government and in parts of the Labour party about how to regenerate towns. The debate takes as its central article of faith that successive governments have cared a great deal about cities and not enough about towns. The solution is therefore to spend more money and/or devolve more power to towns to fix the problem.

But if your starting point is wrong, your direction will be too. It isn’t true to say that the big economic idea that cities would drive growth in towns hasn’t materialised. What is true to say is that the big economic idea of cities as engines of growth has never received the level of ambition and support that it would genuinely require for, say, Leeds, to deliver the scale of economic and social benefit for its nearby towns as London does for its satellites.  It is not a coincidence that Leeds, the largest city in western Europe without a mass public transit system, has failed to produce the level of concomitant benefits for Dewsbury, Pontefract and Wakefield as London has for its neighbouring cities.

Nandy’s argument is that both the last Labour government and the present-one are too focused on the needs of cities. As an electoral appeal to voters in towns that makes a lot of sense, because all voters, regardless of whether they live, like to be told that they ought to have more spent on them and others, less. But as a policy critique or proposal about where the government should go, it doesn’t work. The problem is that both the last Labour government and the three Conservative-led governments since 2010 haven’t spent enough on cities – not that the cities-as-engines of growth model is fundamentally flawed.",True,False,False,,,0,1583152234,,False,0,{},fj9kwmv,True,t3_fcbclk,False,False,t3_fcbclk,/r/LabourUK/comments/fcbclk/stephen_bush_lisa_nandy_is_wrong_uks_big_problem/fj9kwmv/,False,,1591007172,6,True,False,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,r/LabourUK,public,0,[],"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Leader of the Church of Forensic Scientology'}]",richtext,False,False,,

Sure, its not a physiological addiction like some drugs. Sure, its not actually the sugar thats causing ""addiction"", but the reward systems of the brain, which is genetically coded to reward it. I never said it was the sugar itself. 

As the article states, its similair to gambling and listening to certain music. My country is making laws restricting/lowering gambling, or just look at the EU laws with gaming lootboxes. And have you never listened to a really good music so much in a short amount of time that you started to hate it? 

Or in a different sense, if you read the experiences of hookers, you'll see that most of their clients aren't actually there for sex, but for a human touch/connection. People are looking to stimulate their brains reward and other systems when they are sad. Some people find that in drugs, food, watching shows all day or playing hours of video games. 

Our brains are genetically coded to reward these behaviours, because in the past they were very rare, but they have positive consequences IN MODERATION. But in the modern world, the barrier to these limitations no longer exists like it did thousands, or just a couple decades ago.

This is the same as the articles conclusion, which I agree with - its fine in moderation. I'm arguing against it being so easily accessible and unlimited that people can destroy themselves without realizing it. Even if they know its bad, it might be too late - if you go on weight loss/diet subs, you'll see many people struggling to give up sugar drinks. It's clearly more than just a recreational drink for them.

&gt; British troops will return to the front line of the war on terror with a 250-strong unit despatched to “spearhead” the UN’s fight against the world’s fastest-growing Islamist insurgency.

&gt; The light-cavalry unit will be flown into Gao in the north of Mali by the middle of this year and will mount 30-day land operations deep into jihadist territory.

&gt; The deployment is Britain’s first significant return to an active war zone since the end of Operation Herrick in Afghanistan more than five years ago, a mission that claimed 454 British lives.

&gt; The British troops will operate under the UN flag in what experts describe as “the most dangerous peacekeeping mission in the world”. It has already cost the lives of more than 200 UN personnel.

&gt; The planned deployment comes amid US warnings that the threat posed by jihadist groups loyal to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in the Sahel, a vast region of arid scrubland south of the Sahara Desert, could start to threaten Europe as well as the wider region.

&gt; The French currently have 4,500 troops in the area but after seven years of fighting they are losing ground.

&gt; Dag Anderson, the American general commanding US special forces in Africa, said that jihadists had consolidated their hold on northern Mali, particularly in the region where British troops are to be based, potentially giving them a “safe haven” from which to carry out attacks on the West.

&gt; Speaking on the sidelines of Flintlock 2020, a US-sponsored exercise to train African forces in counterterrorism techniques, Gen Anderson also said that evidence was mounting of Isil and al-Qaeda affiliates working together to extend their reach in West Africa.

&gt; “It’s the only place in the world we see that,” he said.

&gt; More than 5,000 people were killed last year as jihadist attacks spread from northern Mali into the centre of the country and then into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. 

&gt; Islamist groups have stirred up ethnic animosities in the Mopti region of central Mali, triggering a series of bloody massacres. 

&gt; Burkina Faso has witnessed a series of Sunday church service massacres targeting the country’s Christian minority.

&gt; With the UN peacekeeping force known as Minusma facing heavy criticism for its failure to protect civilians, Lt Gen Dennis Gyllensporre, the mission’s commanding officer, said that Britain’s deployment would give him the opportunity to turn the operation around.

&gt; By acting as a rapid response unit, British soldiers will form part of a brigade that can be deployed quickly to respond to jihadist attacks across Minusma’s areas of operations, he told The Telegraph.

&gt; “The British contribution will be the tip of the spear of our adaptation,” he said. “With a more manoeuvrable force, we can be more proactive in anticipating attacks, projecting force and deterring and going in where there are confrontations.”

You would still be saying a slur in a casual context. It doesn’t really matter if it’s directed at someone else or not. 

&gt; I particularly remember a youtube video of a rapper (can't recall who) asking a white girl up on stage and then putting her on the spot for saying the same exact words he wrote in the song. To me, it's evidently obvious that the girl wasn't being racist or any way, *shape or form disrespectful towards anyone.

Well then that particular rapper is a douchebag for putting her in that position but she still shouldn’t say it. 

&gt; I feel like playing the ""you can't say that because of what my ancestors went through"" card is legitimate. I do. But then saying it yourself and normalizing the word with your music automatically gives you no right to get angry.

Think of it this way. If you’ve never been called that word or feared being called that word in any context where your very humanity is intended to be denied the way black people normally experience in their every day lives... you probably shouldn’t say it. 

&gt; I live in Europe. My european friends know very little about american history and what black people have endured over the years in the states. Being totally disconnected from the historical context that surrounds that, I argue that most of what they know about the US comes from pop culture. Rap being a part of that has allowed for the word ""nigga"" to enter everyone's dictionary.

Universidades de excelência são peça chave para o desenvolvimento tecnológico de um país, formam mão de obra qualificada, geram maior renda, fomentam o empreendedorismo e aumentam o *softpower* dos lugares onde se situam.
Existem vários sites que fazem um ranqueamento de universidades, mas olhando para esses rankings é difícil ter uma ideia precisa de como cada país está se saindo no geral. Eu decidi fazer um ranking que agrega essas informações, dando um indicador entre 0 e 1 para cada país.

Os rankings que usei como base são o [THE](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) e o [Webometrics](http://www.webometrics.info/en/world). O THE é um dos mais reconhecidos mundialmente, e o Webometrics eu incluí porque tem uma cobertura de mais de 30 mil universidades, e a metodologia que eles usam é bem transparente, baseada em fontes disponíveis na internet. Têm uma variação considerável entre os dois, então uma agregação deles nos dá um resultado mais confiável.

Vou explicar como cheguei nos números do índice na figura.

---

Primeiramente, limitei os dois rankings às 1400 primeiras posições, porque o ranking THE só lista 1400 resultados.

Em cada um dos rankings, no caso de vários países temos mais de uma universidade aparecendo entre as top. Então como gerar um indicador único para cada país? Poderíamos, por exemplo, pegar a universidade melhor ranqueada de cada país, e gerar [um ranking baseado nisso](https://imgur.com/a/GSzbUva). Talvez mais interessante seria somar o número de universidades de cada país, e [usar essa métrica como indicador](https://imgur.com/a/DvQ2Tbk). E como estamos trabalhando com 2 rankings (THE e Webometrics), poderíamos calcular essas métricas e tirar a média entre as duas.

As duas medidas acima tem problemas. Por exemplo, se um país A tem uma universidade muito bem posicionada, digamos em 5a posição, mas tem apenas essa universidade, e outro país B tem sua melhor universidade em 7a, mas aparece mais abaixo no ranking centenas de vezes, o país A ficará na frente de B no primeiro método (pegar o ranking da melhor universidade de cada país). Compare a Finlândia e a Coreia do Sul nesses dois métodos. Isso já não aconteceria no segundo método (contar o número de universidades no top 1400). Porém, esse segundo método tem o seguinte problema: imagine que o país A e o país B tem número semelhante de universidades, porém o país A tem muito mais universidades concentradas no top 100, enquanto o país B começa a aparecer lá pela posição 1000. O país A é claramente melhor que B, mas esse método não faria essa distinção.

Então elaboramos aqui um terceiro método, onde universidades mais próximas do topo valem mais pontos que universidades mais abaixo. A universidade na posição N recebe (1401 - N)^2 / 1400^2 pontos. Isso significa que a pontuação cai rapidamente conforme nos afastamos das primeiras posições, e cai mais lentamente nas posições mais baixas, e as universidades em posições muito baixas (&gt;1000 por exemplo) ganham muito menos pontos do que se fizéssemos um decaimento linear. Resolvi adotar esse decaimento quadrático por vários motivos, mas os principais são: 1) esses rankings não são muito precisos, conforme descemos nos rankings a variação é maior; 2) o prestígio de uma universidade top 100 é desproporcionalmente maior que uma top 500 (mais que 5x). Se ranquearmos os países por esse método, temos [essa figura](https://imgur.com/a/WoqlXnV). Veja por exemplo que agora o Reino Unido passou a China: mesmo com essa possuindo mais universidades do que o Reino Unido no top 1400, as universidades do Reino Unido em geral estão mais bem ranqueadas.

O passo final no nosso índice tem a ver com o tamanho dos países, e isso nós medimos através da população. Veja que no nosso método anterior, a Índia aparece logo atrás da Suécia, com a mesma pontuação (7.79). A população da Suécia, no entanto, é de cerca de 10 milhões de habitantes, enquanto a Índia possui quase 1.4 bilhões, ou seja, 135 vezes mais. Isso indica que se ambos países estiverem em patamares parecidos (em termos de terem universidades de excelência), esperaríamos que a Índia obteria uma pontuação bem maior que a da Suécia para refletir seu maior tamanho. Em outras palavras, se 8 universidades de elite são suficientes para servir os 10 milhões de habitantes da Suécia, certamente não são suficientes para os 1.4 bilhões de habitantes da Índia. 

Então o índice final tem que ""punir"" ou ""descontar"" o tamanho da população, e um jeito simples de fazer isso é dividir pela população. O [resultado disso](https://imgur.com/a/vzaAdpJ) não é tão interessante. O que acontece aqui é que países nanicos são beneficiados demasiadamente. Ninguém diria que Luxemburgo é o segundo melhor país em termos de universidades, e mesmo a China aparecendo atrás do Brasil parece bastante questionável (ou Malta à frente dos EUA!). Claramente a relação entre número de universidades de elite e população não precisa ser linear. Então obtemos nosso índice final ""amenizando"" o peso da população: dividimos o ""score"" pela raiz quadrada da população. Isso dá o ""Index"" da figura acima.

O passo final, que é apenas uma questão de conveniência e não muda o ranking, é normalizar os valores para facilitar a leitura e deixar os valores distribuídos de uma forma mais uniforme. Para isso nós tiramos a raíz quarta (= elevamos a 1/4). Como o país em primeira posição obteve 0.289, para obtermos números mais bem distribuídos entre 0 e 1 (similar a medidas como IDH e Gini), multiplicamos por 3. Esse é o valor em ""Norm. Index"" (índice normalizado).

Os nomes dos países estão em inglês porque peguei direto do dataset (wikipédia).

Nosso índice tem 3 parâmetros vitais: limiar do ranking (1400 = o número de posições consideradas nos rankings), decaimento da pontuação das universidades (2 = decaimento quadrático conforme se afasta da primeira posição) e amenização da população (2 = raíz quadrada, a população pesa menos que a pontuação). Outros 2 parâmetros de normalização que não influenciam na ordem, apenas no número absoluto: valor da raíz (4) e multiplicador (3).

\* Obs: a Turquia foi removida do Webometrics temporariamente, então para esse país eu apenas considero os valores do THE (não uma média entre os dois). Os resultados de Hong Kong apareciam separados da China, aqui ambos estão contando para a China.

&gt; benefit of being in the cloud

Low latency speeds some things up, so we actually run one Cassandra database for each “cluster” (one cluster is in Europe for example) and the one Cassandra is physically located in the same building (same racks) as the cluster it serves.

In B2, when you upload a file into B2, the file lands on a “vault” (group of 20 pods) and is given an internal name that is 82 hexadecimal numbers (that is the “filename” that we see in the pods and in the vault). The mapping from the friendly filename you specify at upload time to the 83 char hexadecimal filename and where the file is in the datacenter (which vault, and where inside the vault) is stored in the Cassandra physically close to that vault.

When you fetch a file using the friendly filename in a URL, the cluster is already in the URL, so DNS routes the HTTPS request to the correct cluster in the world already (like to Europe perhaps) to a load balanced caching layer of 1U servers (not Cassandra yet).  The caching layer server that handles the particular request looks up the location in the datacenter via a Cassandra lookup, fetches the file from the vault, reconstructs the file (Reed Solomon encoded across the 20 computers in the vault) and caches the file on SSD in case it is requested again within the next hour, and serves up the file to the person who requested it.  The Cassandra lookup in that sequence needs to be very low latency, so that is why it is in the same physical datacenter as the pods and vaults.

&gt; public cloud for better reliability

Putting the control layer in a public cloud would be convenient for things like we could quickly add more Cassandra severs as needed.  Right now, if Cassandra becomes overloaded, we have to stock spare 1U servers in each datacenter, and get our datacenter operations employees to physically rack the spares, install Linux, install Cassandra, and manually join the new servers into the Cassandra database.  Luckily the on site operations people have to be there everyday ANYWAY to replace failed drives, so this is not that big of a deal.

&gt; better reliability because public cloud

Backblaze is a public cloud already, so why would moving it from the Backblaze cloud into another cloud increase reliability?  Also, if power goes out in the datacenter containing your data, you cannot get the file back anyway.  If the control layer was in a different public cloud, you would lose the ability to get your file back if that cloud lost power ALSO, so the overall solution would be less reliable, not more reliable.

Therefore it is extremely important Backblaze never use AWS for any component of our service, otherwise an AWS outage causes Backblaze to be out also.

The reason for the heat, I’m told, was the revelation that Mhairi Black MP, the party’s young, firebrand left-winger, last month appeared alongside a drag artist called FlowJob at Glencoats Primary School, Paisley, to discuss LGBT issues with pupils. 

For most people, the performer’s name might have been enough to suggest caution, although she was introduced to pupils as “Flow”. Sexually explicit images on FlowJob’s social media account confirmed for many the visitor’s unsuitability. Looked at generously, the incident could be dismissed as a misjudgement. But Black’s response to criticism of the school was daft and offensive. “Your homophobia is transparent,” she tweeted. Some of her fellow SNP MPs responded with fury, while others rode to her defence.
Tensions within the party over the transgender rights debate are running high. The SNP is split at senior levels on the issue. Joanna Cherry, the MP for Edinburgh South West, who is regularly mentioned as a possible and willing rival for Nicola Sturgeon’s job, told the Herald that “I certainly have my differences with [Sturgeon], not least on her support for the proposed reforms of the Gender Recognition Act”.

In 25 years covering Scottish politics, I have never seen internal SNP relations in such a brittle, cantankerous state. There have always been personal animosities and disagreements over strategy, but they were usually managed behind closed doors, with a united front presented to the media and the wider world.

That practice seems to have fallen away. Cherry and, critics say, her ally Alex Salmond, are at the heart of the trouble. Cherry is a gifted, if abrasive, politician, and experienced Holyrood-watchers distil in her pattern of manoeuvres the classic determination to climb to the top. There is nothing wrong with ambition, of course, and if Cherry believes Sturgeon and her allies are at fault she is perfectly entitled to propose an alternative and to present herself as a figurehead. 

The issue, say Sturgeon’s supporters, is whether Cherry risks doing more harm than good to the independence cause, and whether she is acting as a frontwoman for Salmond, who is said to have become bitterly disillusioned with his successor as first minister. After Angus Robertson, the SNP’s former Westminster leader and a Sturgeon ally, declared his intention to stand for the Edinburgh Central seat in next year’s Holyrood election, Cherry announced she would challenge him for the nomination. This is being viewed as a proxy war between the Sturgeon and Salmond camps, with claymores drawn. 

In yesterday’s Herald interview, Cherry insisted that “I don’t want to replace Nicola; I want to get to know her better,” which sounds like something a python might say to an antelope shortly before swallowing it whole.

Sturgeon has maintained a dignified front in recent months, but I’m told she has not been immune to the troubles swirling around her. Rows over the timing of a second independence referendum have coincided with a difficult period for her government, as the performance of public services under the SNP has been called into question. Her finance minister Derek Mackay resigned hours before he was due to present the Budget after it emerged he had been sending inappropriate texts to a 16-year-old boy. On top of this, exotic gossip has been circulating about the personal life of the First Minister and her husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell.

“She has been upset by these silly rumours about her personal life, and they have impacted on her wider family,” says a source close to Sturgeon. “It’s fair to say that for a while she was thinking about whether she could be bothered carrying on anymore. But she’s come through that now and wants to stick it out for the next five years.”

Her supporters are determined to keep Sturgeon in place. They say she is essential to securing a second independence referendum in the next devolved parliament, winning it, and then taking Scotland back into the EU. “No SNP leader has ever been more important than she is right now,” says an ally.

In the short term, her government needs to get a grip of the political narrative. While the polls remain healthy for the party – and it recorded an excellent result in December’s general election – prolonged negative headlines and stories of internal division are bound to have an impact at some point. The trial of Salmond on sexual assault charges, which begins this month, promises to be a fraught experience. The SNP is fortunate that the opposition parties remain in a state of relative weakness.

Sturgeon might take the advice of the party’s respected former spin doctor Kevin Pringle, who suggested yesterday that the transgender issue should, in effect, be deferred until after next year’s election. She might also consider a wider refresh of her frontbench, beyond the appointment of the highly rated 29-year-old Kate Forbes as Mackay’s replacement.

The trick is deciding who to test, to make the best use of the testing.

In the first stage when the focus is on ""preventing it getting into the country"" they tested people with a direct tie or secondary tie to known foreign places with outbreaks.

But once it's clearly transmitting inside the country (once you have cases where you cannot show a transmission chain that leads to a foreign place, the ""we don't know how they got it"" people) the strategy changes.  The smart move then becomes to ignore the ties to foreign outbreaks and just test people where it's most important to know if they have the virus or not, which means symptomatic people in risk groups for either having the illness go serious (i.e. old people, people with existing health issues) OR infecting a lot of people (health workers, teachers).  

Japan has switched over now to that second prioritization scheme, as has Europe.  The US is likely going to switch very soon if they haven't already, since it's clearly now free inside the US too (there's zero reason why the US would be special in that regard).

Hopefully a quicker diagnostic is found soon, that helps remove the pressure on carefully deciding who to test.

Additionally a lot of this ""oh no they're underreporting"" is just due to the inability to test.  Given the fact that it's spreading inside all these countries, it's likely that loads of people have the virus and are asymptomatic, they aren't going to be tested for that reason (plenty of them probably never even show up at a clinic). That's partly good news, really, in that it implies that most people who get this won't really get sick from it. However the bad flip side is, they can spread it.

You need some Core Tyria Masteries to unlock the Vendor Tab so buy some Materials for one of the two processes, look for YouTube Tutorials on how to get Core Tyria Mastery Points. Also you need several of the Fractal random drops but you can upgrade and downgrade them in the Mythic Forge.

You really should look up Guides, Videos on some Websites, YouTube or just Google for necessary information. Its too much to write that down here. 

But I guess there are also redditposts on what to do in GW2 as a noob and how to fund yourself so *google* ^again for these.

If you want to yeet yourself into lategame and be prepared with knowledge its all depending on your own efforts to help yourself.

Jobs at 500 are required to craft Ascended Armor and Weapons. So to speak you should level up your Armor Profession:

- Armorsmith: Guardian, Warrior, Revenant

- Leatherworker: Thief, Engineer, Ranger

- Tailor: Mesmer, Elementalist, Necromancer

You only need one Job per Account since Ascended Armor is Account-Bound and can be exchanged and sent to other Characters of the same Armortype. So you only need one Armor of a specific attribute per Account. One set of Heavy Berserker to have all Heavy Armor Dudes Power builds covered (Guard, Warr, Reve). As well as one set of Viper to cover all Condition builds of Heavys / Mediums or Lights.

You can usually craft Berserker and make use of it on all classes. Every Class in the game has a working Power damage Build besides Revenant, so Armorsmiths can only make use of Berserker set on Warrior or Guardian tbh.

Berserker set should be your first go-to per default Armor since its the best PvE Power damage set. Its set name is ""Zojja"" so look for Ascended recipies with that Title. Its also cheap to craft compared to WvW sets or PvE Support, Healer and Condition DPS sets!

Stick to Berserker mate, other sets are like 30% more expensive since they're not core Tyria and therefore require Account-bound non tradeable Materials from ther respective expansion. Healer sets like Minstrel (HoT) or Harrier (PoF), Support sets like Diviner (PoF) or Commander (HoT), and Condition DPS sets like Viper(HoT) are cancerous to farm since you actually need to grind the maps in those addons for currency and that is a huge timesink.

Berserker set just requires T6 crafting material Blood so its easy to come by, just buy it of the Tradingpost ^lol or kill some lvl80 adds that look like they could bleed.

Also some guides want you to reroll equipment, you need Laurels tho to buy ascended recipes from the Trainer so thats IMO not as effective on a new account but super easy to safe some gold on established accounts that allready have a lot of recipes unlocked from T4 fractal random dropps.

Just buy Berserker ""Zojja"" Recipes from Vendor!

That covers your Armor, Weapons are a bit more difficult since you might be forced to get all three Weapon crafting professions to 500. Guardians for example might be in a Situation where they want range and a lot of AoE so they go for Szepter and Torch *as well as Greatsword ofc*, Power Guards without Greatsword are the true meme.

So a Guardian is forced to level Weaponsmith to 500 for Greatswords, Level Artificier for the Szepter as well as Huntsman for the Torch.

Same with Mesmer, they might be using Focus(Artificier), Sword(Weaponsmith) and maybe some toolkit weapon like Torch(Huntsman) to stealth themselfes or Pistol(Huntsman) to stun enemys from range.

So usually you only need one Armor Profession but all three Weapon professions to fully equip your main.

Also you DEFINITLY want all available weapons on your main. You NEVER want to be in a Situation where some teammate calls you to bring certain toolkits to really dupe a Bossfight and make it allmost /afk just for you to not have those weapons in your bag. Thats just sad man. At least bring exotics if you can't afford ascended ones.

Guides for crafting are at https://gw2crafts.net

/edit: There is also https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki for all kinds of builds.

Was able to get myself elected as emperor of the HRE by accident after a peace of westphalia was signed and orthodoxy became elegible.

At the point that I conquered all of Rome's territories, the HRE only consisted out of 20 (?) princes. Thats when I added all my own territories to the empire (except the snakey + capital, which I already did when becoming emperor). Revoked privilegia and went on to conquer the rest of europe and established some nice-looking marches.

This is the end situation; I am still Byzantium (prefer it's flag over Rome's smugy flag), Have revoked the privilegia as the emperor of the HRE, passed all the reforms with the mandate of heaven and have the (HRE) imperial marches of  (1) Ireland, (2) Scotland, (3) Iceland, (4) Norway, (5) Sweden, (6) Finland, (7) Kurland, (8) Prussia, (9) Poland, (10) Silesia, (11) Ruthenia, (12) Wallachia, (13) Lorraine, (14) Westphalia, (15) Danmark, (16) Pomerania,  (17) Netherlands, (18) Saxony and (19) Lithuania. Also got a PU on Russia from right when they formed russia. And ofcourse; my dynasty is that of the Komnenoi.

Certo, isso não explica pq vc não ouve falar de terroristas albaneses, ou de pq a França não é um dos países violentos do mundo mesmo tendo 10 milhões de muçulmanos, ou do pq existe fundamentalismo religioso na África cristã ou o pq dos hindus terem praticamente os mesmos problemas encontrados nos países do Oriente médio (machismo, homofobia, perseguição religiosa , etc).

I can't tell if you're a shill, a teenager, or just not paying attention. There's copious evidence of (((globalists))) pushing their agenda. You only have to look at Europe to see how it works. Globalists are currently working overtime to push the same garbage in the US.

Why do you think the MSM continuously and boldly lies to the public? Do you think this is all a coincidence?

Of course, many agnostics are secular, probably the majority of people self-labeling as agnostics are secular, I am too. But there are also religious agnostics. In fact I was one myself in the past: In my youth, I was simultaneously a religious Christian and an agnostic (holding the position that it is impossible, at least for us and for now, to attain knowledge about the existence or inexistence of gods). Then I lost my belief in God, without that affecting my agnosticism in any way.

\- Yes, if you're American then it's extremely likely that the species in your kit is longicaudatus - they're typically the ""default"" species for most kits in this country. If you're European then they might actually be Cancriformis. 

\- Are you able to tell us the name of the kit? That would help us in determining if they include ""everything"" or not. Typically from what I've seen though most kits are good at giving you the essentials (except for water and sometimes a container) but they're very VERY bad with their packaged instructions. You'll definitely want to do some research and/or keep asking questions on this sub when it comes to actually hatching and raising the triops. 

\- Most triops species (including longicaudatus) will start laying eggs once they're 2-3 weeks old, and they'll continue to lay eggs every couple days for the rest of their life. As long as the environment they're in is otherwise healthy kit-based triops should have no problems whatsoever with reproducing. 

\- Food is sort of a non-issue; triops lifespans are only a few months at most and the food packets most kits give you last waaaaaay longer than that. That being said, triops are omnivores and you can feed them pretty much anything (within reason). Shrimp pellets are fine (in fact, that's probably what's included in your kit), so are veggies like carrots and cucumbers. I usually feed my triops shrimp pellets for day-to-day food and give them cucumber slices when I'm going to be out of town for a few days. 

\- I personally use spring water but I know others have had good results with distilled. Tap water is absolutely NOT recommended, even if it's been treated with water conditioner.

\- Don't worry about insects. In fact, in other parts of the world people will introduce triops in to their ponds and other stagnant water pools specifically because they'll eat the mosquito eggs.

I know you're probably not saying it sincerely, and I don't want to sound like I'm arguing at you specifically, but 'taking back control' as it was perhaps unwisely put is not racism.

A great example is some of those small exindustrial towns that it turns out had lots of EU funding pumped in. These were touted as an example of what the EU has done, but if you look closer it's kind of a facade. A new school had been built, but the old one was fine. There were big shiny statues in the centre of town. But people were still jobless. The people who were ex-coal miners were still ex-coal miners, and still had no way within their community to retrain into something else, and the ex-mining towns like this are still dying.

Taking back control was about pushing back against globalisation - the EU acted in England primarily through London, and, while it definitely didn't start it, helped continue the trend of turning England into 'London and the rest.'

You're making a pretty obvious hypothetical reverse Ottoman empire to make me understand but I already know. I'm sick of people fighting about past horrors, hating others for what someones ancestor did. A person is not their ancestor. If history would've gone like you said I would probably act the same as I do now, I can't change history nor blame someone for what their father did. Or not because that is a huge what if scenario.

That's how history was, stronger nations always conquered and subjugated the weaker nations. The Ottoman empire was just another one in that mindless cycle, how do you think Greek culture got to Anatolia. Before the Greeks there were the Hitites, Prygians, the Hattians, Lydians, Lycians and tons more whom all got Hellenized after Alexander the Great conquered the the Persian empire. And after that Rome conquered the Greeks and so on. Just hating Turkey for doing the exact same in history is just really hypocritical. 

The Ottoman empire was an empire, so it definitely was pretty bad. But it isn't any worse than any other empire that existed through history. Do you think that the Byzantines didn't commit any gross acts when they ruled? You're just really exaggerating it. 

You could even say that they were somewhat tolerant in their **EARLIER**(definitly not during the 19th and 20th century) periods for their time period. You would get killed in medieval christian Europe for being muslim but just have to pay tax and give a son in the Ottoman empire. 

Those sons, the Janissaries also weren't mindless slaves as you would call them. Many of them rose to prominent positions in the Ottoman empire, even as far as the Grand vizier, the right hand man of the sultan. Most of them still knew from where they came and chose to help out their old homes. I'm not trying to defend slavery here but janissaries really weren't as bad if you compare them with other slaves of that period.

I think the reason for that is for the most part that Tesla do not advertise their products as a matter of company strategy.  They spend $0.00 in ads while their ICE rivals spend billions.

Yeah, unfortunately there are a lot of negative stereotypes towards Americans. That's beacuse i think your government is not seen very well here and so media recently started vomiting everything against the US, assuming that every American has the same opinions about every single topic. That's beacuse for an average European every American is extremely fat, has a lot of guns, is bigot, racist, entitled, doesn't know geography ecc. That's far from the truth, even if normal people usually don't mind about these stereotypes, it's more something that happens on the internet. For example, I've met many gentlemen from the South who came to Italy (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee) who are absolutely normal people who couldn't care less about my skin color. They also invited me to visit the deep South! 
Sure assholes exist in every country, but it's not fair to address the fault of someone on every citizen of a foreign country.

So, the fear of discrimination is more something due to my OCD rather than a real probability.

Not if you look at what actual professionals say on this matter. ""Other people"" is a very broad term that can include anyone.

In the long-run, the country will benefit from immigration.

Number of immigrants in Germany and/or Europe is still way lower than number of immigrants in US. It is estimated that 15-20% of the population in US are immigrants.

They operated in 1939 but were targeting a variety of people, including Jews, polish leadership, the clergy, academics, etc. They were ridiculously brutal (brutalities in Poland are very much overlooked) and definitely killed plenty of jews - but it wasn't a direct order to exterminate specifically jews, which is what happened in 1941.

1) Siege of Vienna.
The polish army meet up with an imperial army (HRE) to relief vienna. They werent there alone though the polish king was in charge of the force (he was a king after all). Neather did they alone save the city. The famous winged hussars charge happened during a huge battle, where BOTH armies fought the ottomans. The winged hussars decided the stalemate for the imperial army, it didnt single handily defeat the ottomans as portrait in propaganda after said battle. The charge was heavily  propagated after the battle to have been the single best thing in centuries. Simple propaganda. The polish hissars were militarily at the end of their usefullness in militaries on europe. This was a huge boost to their job security.
2) The mongols were ridiciously overstreched at the point in which they reached poland. Also there was major infighting. Poland was the first major unified resistance the mongols meet. Russia was made up of a lot of smaller, weaker kingdoms. Even if the Mongols crushed Poland the HRE wpuld stop them. United they could bring a huge force to bear against them. And the mongols supply lines were..well...half a planet long at that point...
Also even if the mongols conquered europe, christianity would have easily survived like  every other religion within the mongol empire. That claim is just rediciolously wrong. The Huns were a far bigger threat to christianity then the mongols ever were.
3) Well...Poland has always been very ""anti-foreigner"" that helps to stop spreading illness. 
Christianity was never threatened by the black plague...at all.
The population was already bigger than the farming technology could supply them with food. Staving was a comman occurance. 
4) he propably also refers to Poland defeating the soviets 1919. Well, the thing is....Poland decided its destruction on 1919 to happen 20 years later. They made a peace the soviets could never except long term by annexing huge parts of Ukraine and white russia. They also made the germans hate them long term by annexing heavily german populated areas. People often forget that ut was germany that founded poland during ww1 in the first place against the russians.
Next they supported the annexation of czechoslovakia by germany. And to just put a crown on it! Annexed a part of its kands themself. The biggest irony was when polands authocratic leader/argubly dictator later visited Hitler and was making a joke about how they together annexed czechoslovakia. His laugh ended when Hitler meantioned the polish vontrolled german lands and demanded them back.

It’s very clear you expect companies like Apple to pay higher taxes. Like I said, that is okay. What isn’t okay is that you seemingly expect everyone to condemn a company that is following the tax laws of the companies it operates in because “cApItAlIsM bAd.” Ireland purposely and knowingly made tax deals with Apple, but Apple is the bad guy? The EU is now trying to make Ireland force Apple to pay more taxes. This isn’t Apple’s fault at all.

In fact, every single one of your sources is proving exactly what I am saying - that Apple is, in fact, filing taxes in accordance with the laws of the countries it operates in. You just don’t like it, and I understand that.

The Wikipedia article cites that Ireland is in fact refusing to force Apple to pay taxes demanded by the EU commission, and that US multinationals pay 80% of the corporate taxes and employ 10% of the Irish workforce. The fact that companies like Apple pay less than the statutory minimums should not surprise you - no companies pay the statutory rate.  Ireland is enabling this by incentivizing Apple’s presence and lowering their effective tax rate. Yes, their effective tax rate in Ireland is very low - this was negotiated by the Irish government to bring a major corporation in their borders.

The US PSI actually determined that Apple hasn’t broken any laws. In fact, like I have already stated, the committees’ recommendation was to change the law, which is certainly a fair opinion.

You can even read in Vesteger’s comments that you linked to me that countries in which Apple’s Irish subsidiary records sales, like countries in Africa and non-EU countries, are not requiring specific taxes to be paid. It is not Apple’s responsibility to pay these taxes you are demanding.

And another note, the Wikipedia article on ITEP states, “ ITEP... has been characterized as liberal.” That is the definition of biased. It should be very clear from the language that ITEP uses that ITEP is inherently biased towards higher corporate taxes. Once again, that is a fair view to have - you should be careful not to state that a biased opinion is an unbiased fact.

I suggest you read your own sources before you use them to dispute a point. I am simply saying Apple has not broken any established tax laws. And, well, you are showing that they haven’t. If you disagree with the current US tax code, that is okay. If you want to suggest that laws in the Us and Ireland should be changed, that is your right.

Fortunately, what you're talking about—making the trip from Germany to the States—is a lot easier. 

As others have mentioned, you'll want to get an EU Pet Passport from your local vet. Once you get the Pet Passport, travel between the EU and the States is super easy. 

Getting the passport requires you to get your pet microchipped, so keep that in mind if you're keeping track of costs. 

Many airlines will let you take your cat in the cabin as long as its carrier can be stowed beneath the seat in front of you. Since cats are generally pretty small, that shouldn't be too hard. I don't recall there being an extra fee for taking the cat on board. 

We had our cat dosed with some sort of sedative before we got on the flight. Had we not done so, she would have spent 10+ hours hissing and crying and pissing and vomiting. We went to the vet for the pill and dosed the cat about 45 minutes before we went to the airport. She was out cold by the time we made it through security and slept peacefully until we were unpacking at our final destination. 

I don't think you need to use a service for this trip you're considering. I'd only use a service if the country you're going to has some sort of quarantine requirement. Since the US doesn't have such a requirement and traveling with an EU pet passport is so easy, I think that's your best bet.

The UK is losing its representation in Brussels, and the rancorous nature of the exit has destroyed any remaining political capital the UK had on the continent. Politically speaking, this is a pretty clean break. In the future, the UK will have to look to the US for support, and only the US.

That might not be as bad as it seems: US/UK interests are often alligned and the US tends to assume white/english-speaking/first-world countries to be their friends. Maybe they will be treated something like Canada or Australia. And it's not like the UK is under some enormous geopolitical threat- they're too far for the rise of China to pose a serious problem. Hell, one can argue that this whole Brexit indulgence was made possible by the absence of any great outside force like the Soviet Union pushing everyone to remain united.

https://old.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fa0orw/guys_just_like_italy_europe_is_already_full_of/fiv41u2/

Four days ago the UK had tested 7,000 people.

That's the reason for the discrepancy in outcomes. The UK aggressively tested to find initial cases to prevent them from being superspreaders, and the French didn't bother, let it get out of control and now they have an epidemic.

Here's the thing: the French *chose* not to test people, they *chose* to let an epidemic build. Because they're shit.

We took a different route because we Brexited, our govt decided to go for the Singapore approach rather than the shit EU approach, and it is paying off.

Admittedly I haven't read the book in ~20 years, but I did study anthropology once upon a time and I think there are plenty of things wrong with Diamond's approach.  These issues largely boil down to oversimplification and looking for silver bullet explanations from a modern point of view rather than a more nuanced analysis of the questions of why human civilization has evolved the way that it did.  In particular he doesn't really leave a lot of room for random happenstance and other factors beyond the supposed material and geographic superiority of developing advanced civilizations in certain places, he basically starts out from the premise that civilization as we find it today was inevitable and then proceeds to connect the dots.  From what I can see it's entirely possible that things could have turned out differently, they didn't at the time he was writing because we're currently living the long tail of a particular Western European ascendancy.

We treat the rise and fall of various predecessor civilizations as inevitable, without recognizing our current vantage point.  I see no reason to think that this will be so clear in a few hundred years.

I don't think he set out with any malice, but ultimately it's better to treat it as a popularization of ideas related to anthropology than a textbook.  Of his books, I think it's actually one of the weaker ones, in spite of the fact that it won a Pulitzer.

Não vou entrar muito na questão da ""argumentação construtiva"", porque ao fim ao cabo, isto é o reddit! Óbvio que nunca vou desenvolver muito uma resposta, ainda para mais, de um tema que é bastante complexo. (Mas se quiseres uma tese do assunto, tenho todo o prazer em a escrever, é só me dares o teu email). De qualquer modo, analisando a tua resposta, há um aspecto que sobressai logo: ZERO argumentação construtiva! (Agradecia que definisses o que é para ti uma argumentação construtiva!)

Sabes, o meu comentário inicial, apesar de não estar muito desenvolvido, pelas razões que eu já mencionei em cima, contém alguns dos aspectos fulcrais de o porquê a esquerda dominar o país. Isto na minha opinião, claro! Qualquer pessoa é livre de discordar. O ponto onde eu quero chegar, é: a partir do que eu escrevi, há possibilidade de haver uma discussão. Se alguém estivesse interessado em dar a sua opinião, teria desconstruído a posição que eu defendo e teria apresentado a sua. Isto foi exactamente o que tu não fizeste! (ZERO ARGUMENTAÇÃO!) E eu diria que, ao analisar a tua escrita, a qual é bastante abrutalhada e até mesmo burra, que tu, simplesmente não tens capacidade para tal!

E já agora, se me permites, gostava de elaborar quanto à impressão que me causaste, quando li o teu comentário. Portanto... assim que pus os olhos na porcalhada que tu escreveste, automaticamente imaginei um gajo gordo, peludo, feio como oh caralho, com cabelo preto, aos caracóis, mais ou menos pelos ombros. Careca na parte de cima da cabeça, barba por fazer, sentando no sofá, com restos de comida espalhados um pouco por todo o lado, de t-shirt e boxers, com os pés em cima duma mesa de café, completamente entulhada de lixo e também uma caixa de toalhitas húmidas! Uma caixa de toalhitas húmidas que tu usaste furiosamente, ao longo de uma maratona de pívias a ver Entai! E enquanto recuperavas o fôlego, de uma das imensas punhetas, decidiste ir dar uma voltinha ao reddit, o que nos levou até aqui.

É esta a imagem que tenho de ti!

Para finalizar, eu não insinuei que todo o povo é estúpido. Eu insinuei que grande parte do povo é estúpido! Eu sei que parece quase a mesma coisa, mas não é!

Tendo em conta que não sou uma pessoa que viva dependente do estado, tenha tomado boas decisões ao longo do meu ainda curto percurso de vida, viva bem, e sendo também este país - construído pela esquerda - um país pobre, com uma economia estagnada há décadas, e há décadas a receber apoios da Europa, e sendo eu fortemente anti-esquerda, diria que sim, diria que isto me põe no grupo dos inteligentes e tu, no grupo oposto.

Reparei também, que a tua conta foi criada há horas. Suspeito que sejas alguém, que já com uma conta do reddit, decidiu criar uma segunda conta, para poderes fazer os teus comentários mais polarizáveis. Porque te deve afligir muito os downvotes!

There is so much more I could say. I have ADHD and pretty bad Sleep Apnea from having a small airway, so I have basically been so sleep deprived that I might as well have been delirious for my entire life until I was about 20 when my wonderful gf, now fiance, made me go to the doctor after I almost died in a car accident because I always fall asleep while driving. I was very lucky that the accident I was actually in didn't harm anyone, but the one I'm referencing was a potential one, where I blacked out entirely and almost hit a car head on going 65 mph (104 kph) on a highway. I'm currently waiting for my CPAP but my meds keep me awake and able to actually focus! I do pretty good to stay away from most things, but I found out that a tiny bit of Tequila is pretty nice and mj every once in a while keeps the stress out pretty well.

Aside from my inability to resist rambling and accidentally typing out a life story every 20 minutes, I have to say that your the school you are talking about sounds like exactly what I'd expect from a bunch of people who have ""politics""ed their way into high paying positions. I hate how all these unintelligent stupid people fail to understand that people won't stay fit without proper education. On top of that, the education they get will also help them become successful. 

It's really sad who we idolize these days. But it's always been this way, we stumble our way into the future. Just remember the Dark Ages which is a specific event where Christianity alone was able to set all of human progress back by multiple hundreds and possibly nearing a thousand years of progress. It's really easy to look back on history and see those like Abraham Lincoln, who wasn't necessarily the pinnacle of human intelligent and leading, but did leave college for (I think) around 4 years to learn all of Euler's Proofs to the point that he could recognize them and explain them in extensive detail from just small excerpts because he believed that without having that level of profound critical thinking skills he could never consider himself to be a good lawyer. 

Another good reference to throw at people to prove that stupid people are actually very powerful and that the belief that things will always work out in the way they should is this story (which did actually, luckily, end out okay) where a Georgian mathematician who was well known for being very bad at his job abused his connections to people of decent power to attempt to get a bill passed that would force schools to teach a theory he had to allow for the squaring of a circle by changing the value of pie. There are a lot of other details, but basically it made it all the way to the supreme court, where it was going to be passed. Luckily an actually good mathematician heard about it and gave the Judges a math lesson just an hour or so before the bill was set to be reviewed. Now that they understood the math behind why pie is what it is, they reviewed the bill laughed at the bad mathematician and it was, obviously, denied. His bill was also going to require royalties be paid by the schools to him for his discovery and he was actually devising plans to propagate the bill across the entire US legal system, state by state. It's an honestly scary thing.

Also, never forget that winners tell the stories. Many triumphant heroes of history are actually disgusting monsters who raped, enslaved, and brutally murdered many individuals in their pursuit of power and self-righteousness. History is never accurate.

Another issue is that people who don't have drive ways find it hard to charge their car. I was in London and people had cables crossing the footpath meaning the pavements became obstacle courses and were not easy to use if someone has a pushchair or wheelchair.

You're using NA servers as a standpoint for your entire thread.

NA currently has the problem of population, split server and matchmaker that refuses to create masters only lobbies.

So yeah, you probably ""don't mind"" having diamond players with you when you play in Masters because that's what your matchmaker gives you every single game.

In EU on the opposite, finding diamonds is extremely rare if you are in masters, diamond 1 at most or 2 if the matchmaker has a weird hiccup due to a 2-man party in the lobby.

So yeah, we don't really want the boosting squads back here where low masters or even high masters don't deserve to be there but can achieve that place because they queue with diamond 5, making them acquire points by having an overall Team MMR for games that is in diamond while they get masters point if they win.

And then, those people, can queue up alone, having an inflated and non-deserved MMR, and now plague high masters/GM games when they are probably barely Masters. And while you may say and are probably right in saying so that the current masters are pale shadows of the old ones when the game was still quite more alive, the difference in skill is still massively different.

That's why right now, for EU people, since we're recovering from said boosting squads of last season and a season that is dragging for way too long, most GMs are now doing inhouse games where they can have quality games all the times, not having to deal with the griefers, boosted people or trolls.",True,False,False,,,0,1583193870,,False,0,{},fjbi8zw,False,t3_fcfx5a,False,True,t1_fjasszq,/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/fcfx5a/master_leagues_2_person_party_max/fjbi8zw/,False,,1591040521,3,True,False,heroesofthestorm,t5_2ym13,r/heroesofthestorm,public,0,[],"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Zealots'}]",richtext,False,False,,

Meu níver é entre o Natal e o Ano Novo, o que já ""condenava"" meu aniversário a ser celebrado apenas com minha família (que só se reunia pra comemorar uma dessas datas com meus avós). Por conta disso, nunca senti uma ligação forte com meus colegas do ensino fundamental; então, quando me formei, fiz questão de não manter contato com ninguém. Fiz o mesmo quando terminei o ensino médio. 

Só fui encontrar amigos de verdade e que compartilhavam os mesmos gostos num grupo de RPG na internet (saudosos mIRC e Orkut) que mantenho até hoje (mesmo tendo me mudado pro outro lado do mundo e a nossa comunicação ter ficado mais difícil). Mas sempre que posso voltar pra visitar meus pais, separo um fds pra sair e matar a saudade deles!

Portanto, é triste e dói se sentir assim, mas nosso ciclo de amizade, ainda mais hoje em dia, não se limita apenas as pessoas que convivemos por ""conveniência"". Gosta de Minecraft, tenta achar um grupo no FB ou aqui e se eles marcarem um meeting que você possa ir, VÁ!
Ser extrovertido na internet e conhecer pessoas é bem mais fácil do que ""na vida real"". 

Eu sei que você achará sua turma e terá várias outros aniversários para celebrar e relembrar!!!

inb4, Feliz Aniversário!!!! :)

First, is that he assumes that Americans will be content with *isolationism*. Nothing is further from the truth. The United States of America has NEVER been truly isolationist. For most of the 19th Century, Americans were occupied with extending and dominating their continent sized nation (the first intercontinental railway was only completed in 1869). 

After that, they set about facilitating logistical links between their east and west coasts (the Panama Canal was completed in 1914). They also found time to seize Cuba, Philippines and other territories from a weakened Spanish Empire and intimidate and dominate their Latin American neighbors right up to the 1930s (""Banana Wars"", anyone?) - and even beyond.

I haven't seen anything within the American psyche that will see them content with retiring to their quiet corner of the globe - with their 300 ship navy any time soon. Americans are too adventurous, too ambitious and *far too concerned about being influential* for this to happen. 

10 - 15 years ago, everyone was talking about Thomas PM Barnett's *The Pentagon's New Map,* today they are talking about Peter Zeihan's *Accidental Superpower*. I consider this to be a passing fad, the United States of America will try to actively shape the 21st Century - *as it cannot bear to see this century shaped by another power/other powers.*

Secondly, he will be shocked at how well the rest of the world gets on without US power. The Saudi elite are not suicidal, they will not risk a nuclear conflict and total destruction of their nation as easily as Peter makes it sound. Some sort of accommodation between the Saudis, Turks and Iranians is likely - as they are not stupid, and don't want to be confronted with another 30 years war. In addition, they need to sell their oil, to keep their economies going.

I cannot understand the fixation with Japan. Why would Japan, with its aging population, risk a war of attrition with China, which it can't hope to win? What does Japan gain by blocking China's access to the global sea lanes? Peter never explains this; I consider this to be wishful thinking.

The way I see this is; there was an order in the Indian Ocean basin prior to the rise of the West  five hundred years ago, and we could see a return to this order - or something resembling the old order in the near future.

I interpret this as using pragmatism as an excuse for being blind to hope and the idea of making the world something better. We could argue against the fundamental principals and integration of the entire EU at every step using:
