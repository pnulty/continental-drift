Saudi Arabia does not, but they have the capital. Considering how much Saudi Arabia is trying to brew instability throughout the Middle East by funding ISIS and get a riot starting among the Sunni Iranians, it's not far-fetched. I fail to understand your statement where Iran wouldn't be interested in a war because of potential money and yet claim because of sanctions they aren't profiting much anyway.

Because right now they don't have much too loose. Sanctions can't get much worse anyway. If they wouldn't be sanctioned, they'd be interested into maintaining it open. Why should a country willfully close one of their main sources of money? While I agree with you than Iran will win against Saudi Arabia in most scenarios, it will take a long time and it won't be some quick journey. That isn't to say that proxy wars wouldn't happen.

It's much more likely that will simply help the Houthi's to victory and then proceed from their than risk their economy.

That however needs an economy which would be at risk. If Iran stays sanctioned, they have almost no incentives.

&gt; Trade and a navy are intimately connected. If you are going to trade with countries across oceans. You are going to need a navy. What navy is Germany going to use to protect their maritime exports? No, the EU navy doesn't count because it does not exist nor will there ever will be.

That is the point of arguing for a EU army. You saying ""but it won't happen"" isn't really an argument.

&gt; Aircraft carriers is important because if you want to project military power across the ocean onto land, you need air support. Destroyers are unfit for the job. France, Britain, and even Russia with their shitty carrier knows this.

Ok but how is that relevant to the discussion?

&gt; On China, you are utterly mistaken here. It is disingenuous to claim that the Chinese dynasties are all just Chinese. Each dynasty has their origins in different regions. The Yuan was run by the Mongols. Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty. The Han Chinese were placed at the bottom of the social structure. The Ming Dynasty was the last empire that was run by the Han Chinese, it fell due to a bunch of peasant rebellions, surprise surprise. The Qing Dynasty was run by the Manchus, not the Han. The dynastic cycle has always plagued China and the PRC just happens to be the latest one which happens to only exist because of the Americans. The thing to take away from is that all of these dynasties never projected power outside of its own neighborhood and never will.

Sure, but those dynasties are still considered China, whether you like it or not. You creating some arbitrary reasons of ""oh but the ruling class wasn't Han Chinese"" is just that, arbitrary.

Whether Han or non-Han ruling class, what is now China, was unified for many centuries. I'm not sure how the ethnicity of the ruling class changes that what is now China was unified for a long time with relatively few upheaval moments.

Actually the dynastic cycle helped to maintain Chinese unity, because the conquerors always relied on the legitimacy of said cycle.

&gt; But please, continue being delusional and hostile.

I'm not hostile. You simply make quite wild statements which can be looked up quite quickly to see it is mostly wrong.

&gt; Don't hesitate to return back to Wikipedia and quote every single part of my response because of your inability to create a rebuttal into a more formal structure.

Weird way to criticize somebody. Me using wikipedia to get the dates right should be a bad thing? Or me checking wikipedia about how much an economy relies on trade? (apparently 20% export to GDP ratio means total reliance while a 12% ratio means no reliance at all)

U.S farm subsidies are moot in regards to making your argument true.

&gt;And the entire country since it's an industry that exists and produces tax revenue and would likely not exist at all without the aid of tariffs, at least dairy. Again, get rid of supply management if you want, but the tariffs need to stay so long as the U.S subsidizes dairy production.

Again no they, don't. There's no benefit to using tariffs in response to subsidy dumping. It only serves as a tax on Canadians consumers and hurts Canadians. To quote Milton Friedman on Subsidy dumping (only instead in the context of Japanese steel dumping) [There's this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_FXt0eM&amp;t=) The consensus shown here is shared among the mainstream of the profession and proving by overwhelming statistical and empirical evidence.  There's literally no difference between Krugman or Friedman or Keynes on this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

You're not benefiting the average Canadian or domestic industry as a whole by using tariffs to prevent subsidy dumping. You're hurting Canadians consumers in retaliation for the American's sending us free money. It's not the government's business to tell consumers what to buy. If America chooses to waste taxpayer money subsidy dumping Canada, we benefit from that no the Untied States because American Taxpayer money is being siphoned into Canada. Additionally, it's not American subsidy dumpers who decide if Canadian dairy survives or not. it's Canadian consumers. If Canadian consumers prefer cheaper American milk over Canadian milk, that's their business, not anyone else. In any case, it's not a viable or sustainable long term policy for the U.S to subsidy dump Canada to attempt to create an American milk monopoly there. Full stop, Canada is significantly better off without any protectionist policies in it's agricultural sector. Agricultural protectionism for the sake of self sufficiency is one of the most misguided, unsubstantiated arguments in Economic history with centuries of evidence to validate that fact.

There's no objective benefit for the country as a whole to continue these policies or replace them with tariffs. It hurts too many people and helps too few.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I never said anything to contradict that. I said that getting rid of tariffs on dairy is a terrible idea.

That's the problem though. We shouldn't let fear mongering and misguided public perceptions distract from the overwhelming evidence in contradiction to those views. There's far more evidence to suggest that removing agricultural protectionism is the way to go rather than sustaining those policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is more and more true every day. We can't have foreign companies eavesdropping and putting backdoors into Canadian telecommunications. This is the whole issue with Huawei 5G for example

By your own logic,  nearly every other developed country in the world is ridiculously more vulnerable to sabotage that Canada because it keeps it's telecom sectors more globalized. In reality, it has no bearing on our local intelligence agencies ability to do it's job. If Huwaei still an intelligence threat, they'll be treated as such regardless of how liberalized the Canadian  telecom sector is.  That doesn't change under liberalization and I'm not sure why you think it would.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of the foreign telecom companies have anything even approaching a majority stake in Finnish telecom. Canada similarly allows small shares of the telecom industry to be owned by foreign companies, we don't allow foreign companies to own large portions of it. If we just deregulated, Shaw, Bell and Rogers would be eaten up by large multinationals within months, no question. This is unacceptable and a threat to national security.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, that's in complete contradiction to the evidence regarding telecom liberalization. Liberalization equals higher rates of competition and the dismantling of existing monopolies and oligopolies. To argue that Shaw Bell and Rogers would just be eaten up and replaced by foreign oligopolies in the event of liberalization is unsubstantiated. Without government support, telecom monopolies oligopolies cannot sustain themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, let's look at Singapore's telecom liberalization in the 90s and 2000s. Singapore not only exists in a much closer proximity to a country like China, but is one of the most (if not the most) liberalized telecom sectors in the globe. The result of their liberalization policy (as with every other full scale telecom liberalization in a developed country) was reduced oligopoly power, more consumer choice and better services at lower prices.  Likewise, the same liberalization reforms were enacted in Australia far more recently and what you've speculated would happens did not happen. There's more competition, oligopolies have been broken up and [Australian telecom prices are considerably more affordable than Canada's.](https://www.aldimobile.com.au/plans/mobile-plans/) (it's worth mentioning that Australian dollars are basically the same value as Canadian. [A 10GB plan in Canada is $75 CAD a month for Rodgers and around $85 for 20GB](https://www.rogers.com/consumer/wireless/smartphone-plans#financingTabPlan). In contrast An 18GB a month Australian plan is around $25 AU a month. You can't gauge telecom prices the way you can in Canada without the government creating regulatory barriers to entry to prevent competition).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EU states operate as a nation in many respects and most of the ""foreign"" telecom businesses in the EU are from the EU.

Again, that's a very moot point designed to defend poorly reasoned protectionist policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;to suggest that countries like Ireland, Romania or the U.K got rid of a nationalized system because it didn't work well, rather than because the politics of the time demanded it is disingenuous.

That's fairly disingenuous reasoning on it's own. It's also ignoring that all of those countries saw improvements in quality and affordability after privatization and liberalization.  Those reforms were enacted because liberalization was objectively superior to what they had before. As it is the case of Canada, today, now, or in Australia, or in Singapore, or in Hong Kong or in any other developed country or jurisdiction etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean look as Sasktel right here in Canada. They are able to outcompete national carriers on price and have caused Saskatchewan to have the lowest cost mobile plans in the country. It's not fucking rocket science here. This is a uility. We should treat it like one.

&amp;#x200B;

Saskel essentially acts as another large teleco in Saskatchewan and improves prices through market competition. It's a case in favor for market liberalzation, not nationalization.

Your first airsoft gun is the most important purchase you will make in airsoft. As your only weapon it must be **versatile**, **reliable**, **affordable**, reasonably high-performance, easy to work on, and compatible with as many accessories and upgrades as possible. This means buying an Automatic Electric Gun ('AEG') assault rifle or Sub-Machine Gun ('SMG'); **forget about sniper rifles, pistols, gas guns and other restrictive exotica** until you have more money, more experience, and at least one backup weapon.

System Component | Comment
---|---
Primary Weapon | An AEG assault rifle or SMG.
Magazine | A high-capacity ('hi-cap') magazine can replace numerous medium-capacity ('mid-cap') magazines, and many AEGs are supplied with one. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'.
Battery | You should have at least two. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'.
Battery Charger | You may also need a battery tester/balancer.

Again, most airsoft sites will rent you a weapons system, so you don't need to purchase your own until you're ready to commit to airsoft.

Which model of airsoft gun you purchase depends, in decreasing order of importance, on your **budget**, your **location**, and your **preference**. It is important that you understand that small budgets force you to choose from the small range of affordable guns that are not absolutely terrible. We will always recommend that you purchase the best gun that your budget will allow, rather than the cheapest gun that you can get away with: in airsoft, you get what you pay for. Good intermediate guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than budget or beginner alternatives. Your location may impose rules, or affect pricing, in a way that makes one gun better than the other. Your preference will be the choice between the guns that best fit your budget and location.

Commonly recommended choices include:

Make &amp; Model | Approximate Price | Comment
---|---|----
CYMA TM-Clone AK | $100 | CYMA's CM028 and CM028S are clones of the original TM AK-47 and AKS-47, and include a hi-cap magazine. These are the cheapest AEG we recommend, and are generally considered reliable, upgradeable, and reasonably versatile. However, their all-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ('ABS') plastic construction makes them relatively fragile. For improved robustness we strongly recommend spending slightly more to purchase a Glass-Filled Nylon Polymer ('GFP') AR-15 or a steel AK. To see a loadout built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot budget loadout'.
CYMA VFC-Clone AK | $150+ | CYMA's VFC-clone AKs are generally considered reliable, reasonably robust, and good value for money. AKs are generally tougher than AR-pattern alternatives. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an LCT or E&amp;L AK. For more information on loadouts built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot noob ak loadout'.
G&amp;G [Combat Machine AR-15](http://guay2.com/en/product-3-15-14-1) | $140+ | G&amp;G's CM16s are the gold standard of beginner airsoft guns. Built from a surprisingly tough GFP, CM16s are reliable, affordable, accessible and therefore absolutely ubiquitous. If possible, purchase one without G&amp;G's somewhat unreliable electronic trigger control system. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Classic Army Polymer AR-15 | $185+ | Classic Army's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to a slightly upmarket version of G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Tippman Commando | $160+ | Tippman's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Apex Fast Attack | $125+ | OEM'd by Classic Army, Apex's Fast Attack AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. Versions with GFP and metal receivers are available. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
ICS [CS4 Sportline](http://www.icsbb.com/product-category/electric-gun/electric-gun-cs4/electric-gun-cs4-sport/) | $190+ | ICS' Sportline AR-15s are effectively a re-shell of their excellent regular guns in a GFP receiver. They retain the convenient split gearbox system of the regular guns. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an ICS AR-15.
Specna Arms CORE | $130+ | Largely restricted to the European market, Specna Arms' CORE series of GFP AR-15s are considered to be reliable, robust, and good value for money. Many players now recommend these over CM16s, to which they are roughly equivalent. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a Specna Arms AR-15.

**FAQs:**

1. **What's the next step?** If you're new to airsoft and haven't already, reply '**airsoftbot how do I start**'. In the FAQ at the bottom of that reply is a series of steps that will guide you further.

2. **I can't afford any of the guns listed. Now what?** Reply 'airsoftbot what does it cost'.

3. **I've got more to spend than any of the guns listed cost. Now what?** In order to lower the cost of entry to airsoft, the guns recommended above prioritise a low purchase price. Good intermediate and high-end guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than the guns recommended above. Intermediate alternatives are listed alongside the beginner models recommended above, but the massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

4. **What else do I need?** Your gun is only one part of a weapons system, and will require batteries, a battery charger and potentially a battery tester/balancer, and ammunition. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'. If you can afford them, you should also purchase more magazines and potentially a speedloader. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'. The purchase of more magazines usually necessitates the purchase of gear which enables you to carry them, and a sling. You may also wish to purchase weapon accessories such as optical sights and lights. For more information on some recommended weapons systems, reply 'airsoftbot loadouts'. The massive range of alternatives available means it is not possible for Airsoft_Bot to recommend specific models without knowing more about your specific needs and circumstances. Please ask the /r/airsoft community for further guidance.

And when I need a new hip I’ll just wait twice as long or more to get it. 25% of cancer patients in the UK started treatment late. It won’t cost me a thing I just might die waiting on it.

Lol - it’s 3.5% more taxes which on the median income of 60k USD means you would pay 2100$ for healthcare Including dental, and so on. Per year. For your whole family. No deductible, no co pay. No questions asked.

The average in the US is somewhere between 4500 and 8500$ per Year. And then you still have to deal with an industry which tries to kill you since your health endangers their bottom line. 

&gt;	And when I need a new hip I’ll just wait twice as long or more to get it. 

My mum got new hips last two years. Got her first appointment within 3 months of the referral - the second one, one year later mainly cause she wanted to go on holidays in between. 

After her surgery they send her on rehab - at no extra cost besides food. 

If that’s so bad - I can live with it. 

&gt;	25% of cancer patients in the UK started treatment late. It won’t cost me a thing I just might die waiting on it.

And 35% of Americans are under insured (meaning they probably won’t end treatment or in bankruptcy) or have no insurance - meaning they will just die. 

Much improvement

But then this is the NHS - which has been slowly starved by tories who want nothing more then a privatized health care system and are dismantling the NHS wherever they can. 

&gt;	More time off work? The average worker in the United States earns more than the average worker in Austria because of our hard work. Yet again different values.

No you don’t. You have to pay more for housing, healthcare, childcare, education and numerous other things that are taken care of here. 

Again - the average American now needs to work 53 weeks to fulfill basic needs per year - which is as you might have noticed - impossible 

And even if you would have more disposable income. What good is it if you can’t enjoy it. Weirdly all Americans who I know (and it’s a bunch due to my job) seem to enjoy living in Austria more then I the US.

&gt;	Most Americans don’t want a nanny state and the high tax rates needed to pay for these programs.

Most Americans things that those programs are some form of communism and that they are better off paying more for shitty for profit healthcare then less for universal socialized one. 

It’s brainwashing - and your industry is amazing at it and it works as I can see in your case quite well. 

But in the end it’s an easy equation - look what you or your employer pays for healthcare - calculate 3.5% of your gross income and then see who pays more. Add deductibles and co pays. See who gets the better deal. 

I know you will say “I do” but we both know it’s not true right ? 

&gt;	If we did we’d vote for them but you don’t see that happening. It’s like you can’t understand people may value didn’t things than you do.


And how would you vote for it ?

You have no choice (well you had no choice - you might get some choice now).
But so far the choice was either corporate democrat who will not touch the system cause it finances his / her campaigns or even more corporate republican who isn’t even lying about making the system better and just wants people off any social security program. 


&gt;	So no, it’s not some shithole. You can look to Iran or Somalia for that.

Again your are trying to create a comparison with countries that are way less developed and have way less material wealth then any comparable nation. 

It’s a completely useless comparison. 

Compare yourself with the quality of life in Western Europe, in Japan, in well - developed nations and not countries that are on the bottom rung of that.

[],,BillionDollaWhale,,,,,,,t2_5kzidtyt,[],"Go read up on the 1MDB scandal.  It is one of, if not the biggest, frauds in the history of the world.  Billions upon billions of dollars were stolen from the Malaysian wealth fund to pay for things like the filming of the Wolf of Wall Street, towards very famous rappers and R and B singers, millions towards movie posters, millions for excessive gambling etc. etc.  It brought down the prime minster of Malaysia because his wife would spend millions of dollars on jewelry and on things like Hermes bags.  Believe me, you haven't seen excessive consumption until you've seen some of the pieces of jewelry in Rosmah Mansor's collection....she has one friggin necklace with a massive top quality diamond that's worth over $25,000,000.  And that's only the beginning.  Once the scandal broke out, the PM and Rosmah fell from grace and the police confiscated everything.  They had to have something like five *truckloads* carry off all of the Hermes bags and diamond jewelry from Rosmah's collection.  And we aren't talking about POS pieces....alll were the top grade diamonds possible.  

But that's only the tip of the iceberg of the 1MDB scandal.  You should read up how it was all able to be done with a vast, vast network of political corruption, dark lobbying money, and secret offshore bank accounts.  At one point, the scam artists behind 1MDB were able to infiltrate Obama's White House, and the person they had a connection with enriched himself with $10 million dollars of stolen 1MDB money + used money to fund gubernatorial and senate races for the Democrats.  The FBI is currently investigating this, and has even seized proceeds from films like Daddy's Home and Wolf of Wall Street.  

The conspiracy theory related to this takes a dark turn.  Media in Malaysia who tried to report on this were intimidated, and one reporter was murdered.  It is not out of the question at all that the globes elite who benefited from stealing billions of dollars from the poor and middle class in Malaysia wanted the reporter shut up.  He was found in a barrel at the bottom of some water (can't remember his name at the moment).  The whole story involves exclusive celebrities and real estate in the US, billionaire sheiks in the middle east, corrupt politicians all over asia, and shady banking in europe and the cayman islands.  You can't make this shit up.  

Go look up the 1MDB scandal and even on the US justice department's website for keywords like '1MDB' and 'Jho Low' (the main suspect).  It is insane!  That cocksucker needs to be brought to justice yet he continues to game the whole world system by paying off corrupt autocrats and finding loophole after loophole in the world's banking systems. Jho Low himself was also recently able to sue publishers in the UK from printing a book related to this scandal that outed him, showing you the lengths to which this asshole will try to suppress free speech and coverage of the scandal.  It also recently came to light that the Thai junta helped Jho Low arrest key figures who were about to whistle blow while they were traveling through Thailand.  The whole thing is corruption on a massive scale, and the Malaysian commoners paid for it dearly (their economy and currency has since tanked after the 1 MDB fund became insolvent after billions had been pilfered from it).",True,False,False,,,0,1583041707,,1583043045,0,{},fj5sm0q,False,t3_fbiay6,False,True,t3_fbiay6,/r/AskReddit/comments/fbiay6/what_conspiracy_theories_do_you_think_are_too/fj5sm0q/,False,,1590942177,3,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,

We know it sucks, as we were looking forward to seeing you all, but hold on to your tickets we’ll be announcing the new dates very soon,” Green Day said in a statement on its official website.
The move followed the decision by South Korean boy band BTS - the biggest K-POP band in the world - to cancel four concerts in Seoul’s Olympic stadium in April that were due to kick off its latest world tour, citing concerns over coronavirus.
BTS, whose new album “Map of the Soul:7” topped charts in Germany, France and Britain on Friday and is expected to do the same in America, has spent the past several weeks in the United States, where they recorded a performance at New York’s Grand Central Station and appeared on “Carpool Karaoke” with late night TV host James Corden.
BTS is currently still scheduled to perform several dates in California in late April.Last week, British rapper Stormzy and American R&amp;B singer Khalid also postponed all the Asian concerts on their tours from late March to mid April that would have taken them to cities including Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul.

Not sure what this means, but Turkish losses are almost always to jet strikes or artillery. I think the 2020 losses were 25 before the big attack, and about 60 afterwards, officially.

As for the war itself, Assad has all but won I'd say. He united most of Syria but at what cost? Economy ruined, half the population hates him, cities devastated three times over. Syria is on the verge of being a Russian puppet state at this point, because they are completely dependent on Russia to stop Turkish advances.

Kurds ended up in a surprisingly okay position even though US sort of sold them out to Turkey. Expect it's obvious that US hasn't sold the Kurds fully because you can see the Turkish capabilities against Syria right now. Turkey did not attack the Syrian Kurds with nearly as much power as they are attacking the Syrian regime now. Clearly US used diplomatic means to slow down and temper Turkey's actions against the SDF / YPG.

ISIS is practically disbanded and is no longer a threat to any state. But individual attacks still might happen in Europe, Turkey and Syria.

Turkey has failed in her long term strategic objectives in regards to Syria. Now Turkey has to commit it's army just to keep the small number of poorly trained rebels alive. Turkey is hosting 3 million plus refugees and if Idlib falls, that number will grow. Erdogan has ruined relations with just about every nation on the planet.

If people are staying home and factories stall because of that, its not something you can compensate for with free money.

As for GDP; you distort the data by picking the financial crisis as your reference point. The UK was impacted far more by that crisis than countries like germany or france or even southern countries.  If you where to pick your benchmark date **before** the crisis, you would see a very different picture, one where the UK is lagging most of the eurozone.

Humans need vitamin D to remain healthy. One way to generate vitamin D is light. When humans started to leave Africa and moved into the north where there was much less sunlight, the ones with a lighter skin had better chances of survival. After many generations everybody became white. (Being white in a place with lots of light is a disadvantage as this increases the risk for skin cancer.) Sure there are some other minor differences.
About the oppressing: all humans are pretty good at treating other people like shit; when one race is ""on top"" or when the other,  depends on the circumstances of the time. All races had slaves at one time or another, or did other horrible things to others.
What you are getting at is probably the slave issue in the US; no doubt a horrendous situation. Africans sold their enemies to Europeans, who stacked them like logs in ships and sold them to Americans who used them as slaves. To justify that to themselves, they had to dehumanize the Africans (oldest trick in the book) and could do this with the Bible in the hand. 
Slavery is long over, but this artificial division still lingers on. And it will linger on longer as, white people need to acknowledge the shit some of their ancestors have done, but black people need to stop blaming everything on discrimination; that doesn't help either; maybe you didn't get that job only because you were less qualified instead of a racist employer?
When this race nonsense finally will be over, the color of your skin should mean the same as a hair color, or the color of your eyes. Something pretty irrelevant. No worries though, if that ever happens, we humans will have something else to divide ourselves in: political view, religion, sexual preference, the nation you live in, the language you speak, you name it.

For the record; I'm a white European, my ancestors were all poor and had to struggle to survive. I don't care about the color of your skin, I rather mind how someone behaves. I actually don't feel very comfortable with African Americans out of fear I say or do something that might offends them. I don't have this with black people from other nations. Some of my colleagues got in trouble for saying or doing things in front of African Americans they would say or do to everybody.

Did you reference a topographic map to see if the landscape would allow for the rail line to go through there? Are you basing parts of it off the current (refurbished) railway?

I've often thought that an entirely new line should be made which follows the Trakia highway more or less in parallel. The current Burgas-Sofia line was, and still is being reworked to allow the Burgas-Skopje rail connection. It's an EU-funded project which should finish by 2025 if I recall correctly. It also had a budget of roughly 350 million euro, so that puts things into perspective, compared to the 16/20 billion you're estimating.

Also, by high-speed, it's usually implied that the average speed would be in the 180-200 km/h range, with the sole concept of connecting only the biggest, most important cities as fast as possible. So I don't think having the train stop at Yambol or Pazardjik would make sense.

Otherwise we definitely need a big improvement on our East to West connection. I recently had to travel by public transport both from Burgas to Sofia and from Burgas to Plovdiv. In both cases I chose the bus and frankly BS-SF took 4h30m and BS-PD also took 4h30m but that's because fucking Union Shittony stops everywhere and doesn't even drive as fast as he is legally allowed.

Anyway, we need a faster way to connect to the capital. close to 5 hours by bus and 7+ by train for a measly ~380km is ridiculous (even given the topology).",True,False,False,,,0,1583053208,,False,0,{},fj62b92,False,t3_fbr2os,False,False,t3_fbr2os,/r/bulgaria/comments/fbr2os/i_made_a_concept_map_of_how_a_high_speed_rail/fj62b92/,False,,1590946806,9,True,False,bulgaria,t5_2qhx7,r/bulgaria,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,

&gt;Game looks cool and i have few questions
&gt;
&gt;Does it matter if i use the launcher or steam version? Because steam complete edition is cheaper compred to the one in sqaure website?

Yes, it matters. Despite it being cheaper at the moment on steam, most people still would not recommend getting the Steam version. You will have to buy the Steam version of all expansions in the future. You cannot mix-and-match licenses (i.e. buy from SE store, amazon, gmg, etc) if you get a Steam license. You also must open the game through Steam  now.

&gt;What will i get from the complete edition in terms of ingame comtent? I see some races and classes not abailable to me because its locked?

You'll get the base game, and Shadowbringers, which will include all previous expansions. With this, you unlock 3 races, and can get 7 classes. However, 3 classes require a level 50+ char and must have completed the story up to Heavenward to unlock. They also start at level 30, not 50. The other classes start at 50 or 60.

&gt;Which eu realm is better to join?
&gt;I heard some servers got the exp buff(until lvl70) and players say the buff is great but i will out level most quests because of it so i need a realm without this buff?

Don't worry about having the buff or not. Yes, you will probably over-level pretty early, but you still get synced down in dungeons or some special quests. It's still more beneficial to have that buff than not.

As for specific server, I'm NA, so I can't recommend.

&gt;I can decide on a starting class-sadly the only one handed sword class is samurai which is locked until lvl 50 -/- does it mean i need to open a random class and then change it to samurai at lvl 50? I also wanted to try Bard/Archer but they say its one of the weakest for raids and other content.. so i'm not sure what to do.. maybe dragoon! But they use spears and not 1handed swords

Yes, you'll need to start as another class before you can play Samurai. SAM can be unlocked at level 50.

As for Bard, just because it doesn't produce the highest dps doesn't mean it's ""weak for raids"". Raid parties are generally balanced to have 2 tanks, 2 healers, 1 melee, 1 physical ranged, 1 magic ranged, and 1 other dps (melee or ranged). Bard is phys ranged, and provides a somewhat-passive damage buff support for the team. Although they are one the low end compared with the 10 dps classes, they are still very common in groups. The game is very balanced for group compositions.

If you want to play SAM, I suggest either LNC/DRG, or ROG/NIN. You can unlock Rogue at level 10, and I think it would play a *little* more like SAM than DRG would, mostly in terms of speed. You could also pick PUG/MNK, as the two classes share gear.

And please cite me a source saying that Muslims killed 500 million Hindus, considering India’s population never even reached close to that under Mughal rule, a time notable for being an economic golden age. Further the Mughals ruled with the support of Hindu leaders and delegated much of the local administration to them.

Finally there is a relationship between poverty and reactionary beliefs, in the US where the average Muslim is better off than in most of the world they are more likely to support gay rights than the average evangelical Christian. 

But outside of all that it’s also the case that leftists largely support secularism as opposed to any religion, or even state atheism. Leftists support Muslims in India because they are a minority oppressed for their religion, something that is as intrinsic to the individual as their culture. Look at how the Indian government burned down a shanty town because the people couldn’t produce papers and were presumed to be Muslims, the people that lost their homes were in fact working class Hindus who couldn’t afford papers. We don’t support any religion more so than another, we oppose oppression on the basis of religion and Muslims are a widely oppressed minority, pretty different from how you’re interpreting our position.",True,False,False,,,0,1583060319,,False,0,{},fj67a5t,False,t3_fbruzq,False,True,t3_fbruzq,/r/DebateCommunism/comments/fbruzq/why_does_the_left_support_islam_in_india/fj67a5t/,False,,1590949171,3,True,False,DebateCommunism,t5_2vkao,r/DebateCommunism,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,

That's not what I was arguing. My argument was that ""permanent"" residents (I'm using the word permanent a bit liberally here) should be the only ones entitled to welfare, otherwise this opens the door to so much more abuse of welfare systems.  
  
I'll take Finland as an example for simplicity: citizens, refugees, third country nationals living with their spouses, third country nationals with a permanent residence permit, ... all those people are in Finland on some basis that is not economic, therefore they're entitled to welfare should they need it.

The distinction between ""caste"" and ""people"" badly reflects that dualism, since neither the winners are from the right nor the losers from the left; On the contrary, we have jumped from a logic of classes (materialist) to a logic of identities and values ​​(postmaterialist). Among the winners there are not a few successful young professionals or entrepreneurs, in dynamic economic sectors, along with large, medium (and even small) companies, which have launched (successfully) into the global market. They are enlightened, urban, and many vote for ""progressive"" formations, what Piketty calls the gauche brahmane (the new ""caste""). And there are also many types of losers: they can be Aymara in Bolivia or manual workers of the United States rust belt. Or they may be an old civil servant middle class or Spanish farmers and ranchers, fed up with the ""progre"" culture of urban students that stigmatizes bulls, hunting or Holy Week processions and belittles and ignores the rural. Paradoxically, the illiberal is often a demand for freedom, since this new ""populism"" is, in large measure, a counter-cultural reaction, especially acute where the moral transition to a permissive and postmaterialist society has been more abrupt (it is the case of Spain), generating deep intergenerational and sectoral differences. Thus, this anticosmopolitan and renaissance reaction can jump both on the left (in Greece, in Chile), and on the right (in France, Germany, Poland, USA, Spain), although both seek the protection of the State and old borders. Kirchner or Corbyn (or Pablo Iglesias) are not that far from Le Pen, Orbán or Salvini (or Abascal).

By the way, emigration is, more than cause, scapegoat for this renaissance, because again there is little correlation (macro) between foreign presence and xenophobia (eye: not in small cities). Neonationalism has more support in the interior of the United Kingdom than in London, in the American Middle West than on the coasts, in rural Lepenist France than in the cities, in the Ampurdán than in Barcelona.

But to understand the intensity and generality of the revolts it is inevitable to mention a couple of technological variables that are radically changing the agora of politics.

First, the Internet, which allows the transfer and dissemination of cutting-edge technologies in the organization of revolts, from how to engineer a Molotov cocktail to how to deal with the police. Previously, local learning was necessary; Today, just go to the web (deep or superficial) to find all kinds of manuals. A global learning for global revolts, which mimic. With few consequences for the rioters, by the way, as hyper-guarantee legal systems shield them from any negative consequences. The revolt is made at zero cost.

But even more important are social networks, with global penetration rates above 60%. Well, if something had to be invented to organize riots, we would invent social networks, and nothing that happens would have the intensity it has without them. Fantastic mechanisms to organize protests, prepare them, summon them and manage them during the same development, and that allow to add all kinds of discontent and “outraged”, frequently for different, even opposing causes. They are ""moved"" (hirak, in Arabic), sometimes even performances or flashmobs, without clear leadership and without the slightest intention of transforming even into pressure groups. But here it is that the same social networks are totally inadequate spaces for debate and dialogue, unable to generate agreements and consensus. On the contrary, they facilitate insult, aggression (again free of charge, without cost) or lies, fake news, polarizing audiences that take refuge in their opinion bubbles. Almost at the antipodes of a Hamasmasian ideal dialogue situation. There is no space (no room) in that space to move from protest to proposal.

7)

So the new communication technologies have facilitated the protest, but, at the same time, they have hindered the proposal. But what about the possible political responses? Couldn't these accommodate the demands? Here we find the second big problem, because we have to add another consequence of globalization, perhaps the most important one and the one that undoubtedly endangers representative democracies. I allude to the fact that more and more problems are already global, transnational, and can only be addressed globally or, at least, in large political spaces (such as the EU or large countries: China, USA). The economy, of course, is already global (even more so in open and exporting economies), such as climate, emigration, security and terrorism, finances, crime, even diseases and pandemics, such as the current one. of the coronavirus. And I could go on. But the architecture of politics remains based on states that are sovereign in their territory, but incompetent beyond. And so, as globalization progresses and we leave the classic Westphalian world behind (we are out of state), a growing hiatus opens up between the needs of world governance to generate public goods and the territorialized architecture of politics. I suspect that the great problem of the 21st century is not that there are problems, there always are; is that we do not have global governance instruments to manage them.

**The big problem of the 21st century is not that there are problems, but that we have no instruments of global governance**

The consequence is that states cannot cope with the demands of the population. If the basis of democracy is ""accountability"", it has jumped to a higher level, where it finds no interlocutors. That is why the European Union is so important, because it is the mechanism to deal with these global problems. But the paradox is that the EU is not (at all) a democracy, so we have (simplifying) democracies without the ability to respond and the ability to respond without democracy - and the same could be said of the UN, which is also not a democracy , and that has invented the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to generate a certain global governance.

**And hence also the urgency for the EU to truly become a United States of Europe, which can democratically manage the problems of European citizens.**

So they are times of ""outraged"" mobilized and well organized, but of governments divided and disorganized. Times in which it is easy to organize the protest, but difficult and slow to prepare the response. We had invented social mediation systems; parties, trade unions, business organizations and collective bargaining should add discomfort and find ways of solution. But the parties represent the globalized, and the unions, the public sector; both lack credibility, many companies have denationalized (paradoxically: that's why they support separatism in Catalonia) and the state lacks levers. It is not surprising that national policy becomes symbolic and expressive, of ""posturing"" (low cost), since identities and ""narratives"" can be managed locally (even in Teruel).

“Constructivist” and performative policy, which believes that the world can change by changing the language, while instrumental (non-expressive) policy jumps from level and is decided in the EU or in global networks and markets. When we talk about the need for a new social contract, we must think about it in economic and cultural terms. Times of change, of course. Global changes, huge, because the rise of China, India and other giants can not cause seizures, particularly in Europe, which was 25% of the world population a century ago and today is 7% (while Asia is 60 %). Neowestfaliano world but poseuropeo and, to a large extent, even post-western. But changes that, in the end, are manifested locally, ""glocal"" changes. We have no choice but to face them and it will not be an easy or fast task. In any case, when we talk about the need for a new social contract that sutures dualization, I suspect that we should not only think about it in economic terms, but also in cultural terms. Nothing forces us to be the first of the class in postmaterialism.

As always, you have to listen more, and not just talk, do more political pedagogy, but give citizens less lessons.

De novo, essa retranca do time da casa é uma lenda urbana de quem não para pra analizar as partidas de futebol. Na verdade não existe retranca do time da casa na partida de ida, porque este *precisa* partir pra cima e conseguir o resultado. Se contentar com 0x0 é pedir pra ser eliminado.

&gt; E em torneios com jogos de ida e volta, ambos os times tem a chance de jogar em casa.

E daí? O que isso tem a ver?

&gt; O mandante, por outro lado, não pode nem sonhar em levar gol. Qualquer gol que ele tome pode significar a sua eliminação, ainda que vença o jogo. 

Tautologias que são verdadeiras tanto pra regra gf quanto pra mata-matas sem a regra gf.

&gt; Ele precisa evitar levar gol. E isso é mais importante do que abrir o placar.

Óbvio que não. O mais importante é, e sempre vai ser, vencer fora. Claro que é mais importante evitar levar gol com regra gf do que sem regra gf. Mas um time pode tranquilamente se classificar ganhando de 2x1 e empatando em 0x0, ou ganhando de 4x1 e perdendo de 2x0, como o Galo fez contra o teu time em 2014.

&gt; Em um jogo de ida, 0x0 é um placar excelente para o mandante, pois na volta ele poderá empatar por qualquer placar que não seja 0x0 que ele passa direto. Outro 0x0 e o jogo vai pros pênaltis.

Tu só pode tar morando no mundo da lua pra falar uma coisa dessas.

Eu não vou negar que 0x0 é vantajoso pro mandante. Talvez seja, talvez não. Mas passa longe de ser ""excelente"". Na verdade 0x0 com gf é o placar mais neutro que existe no futebol (quer dizer que não dá uma vantagem significativa pra nenhum dos times). É fácil demonstrar isso. Cria uma thread agora, ""0x0 em jogo de ida com gol qualificado beneficia o mandante ou o visitante""? Tu vai ver que muita gente vai dizer que beneficia o mandante, muita gente vai dizer que beneficia o visitante, e não existe consenso.

Tambem depende do time. 0x0 no Beira-Rio no jogo de ida é horroroso pro Inter. 0x0 na Arena ou no Maracanã no jogo de ida é decente pro Grêmio ou pro Flamengo.

&gt; Mas se o placar agregado fosse o principal critério de classificação, ele poderia ter razão em preferir um empate de 0x0 em casa a uma vitória de 2x1.

Yes I did and my source is from a person involved with the Greece-EU negotiations from the period. So I would say I have filled the blanks pretty well.

&gt; They are helping by taking those immigrants

See this is where you don't understand how borders/nations work. Germany is part of Schengen this means free movement which means that if Germany accepts someone in then they can go to other Schengen countries which means that decisions of Germany affect other EU nations. And if Germany invites in ton of people who are a strain on welfare systems and a security risk. Then they are hurting the other EU countries as well. Same thing happens when Greece lets in migrants also. 

This is where EU countries should get together and work together instead of irresponsibly letting in migrants. And countries not being able to secure their borders should be hold responsible for that whether its failing to stop migrants or inviting them in. If unable to do this then Schengen free movement must be broken down.

So housing migrants is not helping its the opposite of helping here.

&gt; Dude this isn't the USSR, no you arn't allowed to just shot people who cross the border.

I would absolutely agree. First you must inform them they don't have permission to enter the country and to turn around if they refuse fire a warning shot and only after that shoot them.

I have no idea where you are getting mass executions from. WTH is wrong with you. What on earth have WW2 and SS got to do with this??

&gt; Now you are just throwing everything on a pile and see if it makes sense. (no it doesn't).

What part of it doesn't make sense please go into detail on what/why?

&gt; This has nothing to do with an EU monster state.

It shouldn't, yet EU keeps making it harder/impossible for nations to police their borders again see their reactions to Hungary actually setting up border security. This is the problem and without EU this problem wouldn't exist.

It really makes me sad that in the USA, which claims to be a developed nation, it isn’t crystal clear why something like sick leave is invaluable.

Couple reasons right off the bat:

1) One thing that doesn’t occur here in Europe and did at workplaces in the USA and military bases overseas, is these “bugs” that sweep through an entire office. Not to say there isn’t a flu season here, but when people are sick we do not have a culture of distrust and force sick people into the office. We send them home to get better. 

And if we do feel like they are feigning illness, no one here can claim they cannot afford a doctor so we tend not to have many malingerers.

2) Secondly, and maybe more importantly, we want our people to get better so they can come back to work and be productive. I guess in a low-wage society like the USA there is perhaps less of a need to protect people with fewer skills and less education, but we wouldn’t think of abandoning employees that we have invested so much in, and who are vested in us. Except for unskilled labour jobs, if you are firing people after a week or two of being ill then you didn’t have the right people to begin with (btw, I’m not suggesting unskilled workers should be fired quickly either, but simply that USA companies are not hiring good employees if they feel compelled to abandon them so quickly).

They were always neo-liberal and started privatising everything, but they also fixed the crippled economy and improved life standards. Erdogan was quite in favour of Western values up until around 2011 - talks with the EU was going so good that many were hopeful we would be in the EU in a few years. They were religious and weren't hiding it (and were allied with the fundamentalist religious organisation which they had a conflict of interest with in 2013 and which was behind the coup attempt of 2016) but seemed to conduct it in a pro-liberty manner; for example, they removed the hijab ban in universities and state institutions. I believe they were still corrupt back then, slowly appointing their partisans to positions in official institutions, favouring them everywhere etc. but it wasn't significant enough to disturb the majority (it was actually liked by the religious rural population and urban lower working-class whose interests were often undermined by the secular governments of the past) and he had the support of businessmen who were pretty content because of the good state of the economy.

Things started changing around 2011, when Erdogan started becoming more authoritarian with each passing day. 2013 was one of the peaks, when people started resisting his increasing authoritarianism and desire to turn everywhere into a corporate playground. It is also the year in which Erdogan's party split up with the fundamentalists I mentioned; the group, being in control of the police forces, exposed their corruption and arrested many people from Erdogan's government. He survived nonetheless, initiated an aggressive breakdown of any opposition and was still going relatively strong. He used the coup attempt in 2016 as an excuse to exercise total control over the country and made the regime semi-presidential, granting himself immense privileges and power. He became significantly more conservative and nationalist in the past 5 years.

The economy is now more fragile than ever because of Erdogan's stupid speeches. He practically controls the Central Bank and thinks his ideas on how to run an economy are more valid than actual economists' (he was originally an imam!), which frightens the investors. This is why most businessmen stopped being in favour of Erdogan, although Erdogan threatens them frequently to get what he wants.

And there you go, the story of a man with an iron fist. His authoritarianism is only making him less popular these days, but he has no choice but to hold onto it if he wants to stay. He supports his image using nationalistic nonsense which even he was blatantly against only a few years prior and by trying to arouse a meaningless patriotic feeling in people.

 com os “cancelados” do dia.

 Seria de grande utilidade para desatentos como eu, que não estão antenados às sentenças sumárias proferidas diuturnamente pelos tribunais da internet. Já me aconteceu várias vezes de estar num jantar, citar um artista e sentir o climão.

 Então alguém me cochicha: “Você não viu? Acharam um vídeo dele contando uma piada de papagaio numa entrevista de 1995. Cara, desrespeitava o papagaio, punha a ave numa posição humilhante;   
 ornitofobia nojenta!”.

 A coluna seria dupla: a dos cancelados pela direita e a dos cancelados pela esquerda. Na da direita, por exemplo: “Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca nasceu em Londres, em 1985. Formado em economia e filosofia, trouxe esperança de renovação para o conservadorismo brasileiro com seus artigos, vídeos e participações na rádio Jovem Pan.

 Quando, porém, Joel passou a fazer um quadro fixo ao lado do comunista globalista maconhista Leonardo Sakamoto, no Canal MyNews, foi imediatamente ‘cancelado’ pela direita. Uma trolagem de sétimo dia será dedicada a ele por 15 mil robôs, mais disparos massivos de WhatsApp, na próxima quinta, às 11:00. Joel deixa um pai, uma franja e uma pinta”.

  Ao lado, o “cancelamento” do Leonardo Sakamoto: “Há anos dedicado a pautas políticas e com forte engajamento social, Leo, como era conhecido pelos amigos, foi ‘cancelado’ após participar de um programa ao lado do fascista bolsominion homem branco hétero cis Joel Pinheiro da Fonseca.

 Um ato de esculacho coletivo está marcado para amanhã, diante da FFLCH, onde um boneco de Sakamoto com cartola do Tio Sam será incendiado ao som da bateria de maracatu da Letras —bacharelado em grego”. 

 A seção também poderia ter, nos moldes da coluna do Ronaldo Lemos, um “Já era”, “Já é”, “Já vem”, informando que crimes expiraram, quais os vigentes e uma aposta dos que virão.

 “Já era: fantasia de índio no carnaval (Raoni liberou)”. “Já é: falar “índio”. O termo correto agora é indígena”.” “Já vem: dar nomes para filhos. Eles que devem escolhê-los quando forem grandes. Ou não escolher. Afinal, dizer ao outro que me chamo Antonio é impor a ele a minha verdade, quando do ponto de vista dele, tão legítimo quanto o meu, posso ter muito mais cara de Adalberto, Sheylla ou Siegfrid Von-Tsé-Tung”. 

 A coluna terá um prazo para acabar, pois creio que em uma década não haverá mais um único terráqueo que não tenha sido “cancelado”. Talvez aí voltemos a nos dar conta do óbvio: o ser humano é complexo, tem virtudes e defeitos, às vezes tropeça, às vezes estende a mão —às vezes faz as duas coisas ao mesmo tempo. 

 [Como disse Obama, no ano passado](https://encurtador.com.br/lst57): “Essa ideia de pureza, de jamais transigir (...), vocês deveriam superar isso, rápido! O mundo é confuso. Há ambiguidades. Pessoas que fazem coisas muito boas têm falhas. Pessoas com quem você está lutando podem amar os filhos e ter algumas semelhanças com você.

 E um perigo que eu vejo nos jovens (...) é essa percepção, às vezes, de que a forma de promover a mudança é ser o mais crítico possível com os outros, e isso é suficiente.

 Se eu tuitar ou fizer uma # sobre como você fez algo errado ou usou o verbo errado, posso relaxar e me sentir muito bem comigo mesmo. (...) Quer saber? Isso não é ativismo.

Now, before the new law, you could buy any gun that isn't an automatic with a WES (Waffenerwerbsschein = weapons permit). This permit still exists but is only intended for guns that comply with the magazine restrictions with the caveat that you commit a crime if you insert a 20 round magazine into your semi auto rifle. So to still be able to own ""large"" magazines, Switzerland implemented The ABK (Asunahmebewilligung klein = special permit small). With this you can buy rifles and pistols with ""large"" magazines, but you need to either prove that you shoot or be an acknowledged collector. 

Now, the implementation of the ABK created a lot of chaos and unneeded bureaucracy since some guns fall between the seats and the federal gun bureaus (think state ATF) also don't really know how to classify certain stuff, like Roni kits and all. 

What changed for the better is that full auto guns that were converted to semi are now also obtainable with an ABK instead of a fullauto permit like before. Because before, a gun that was once fullauto is still considered fullauto.

Everything else more or less stayed the same.

The idea of a resurgent Byzantine Empire along the lines of the Komnenian restoration makes for interesting lines of thought but these are unfortunately irrelevant. The fringes of the Empire were already being picked off by the Bulgarians to the North, and the Muslims to the East and South. 


The Emperor had already pawned the royal jewels of his crown and sold the lead tiles of the palace. He had also already floated the idea of allowing the Orthodox Church to once again recognize the supremacy of Rome, however this ploy was unsuccessful and had at most received warm reception from Pope Innocent II and III.


So what happens next is that Constantinople is allowed to limp along until the Turks, Bulgarians or some other upstart enemy are able to besiege the city.  


It is important to note that the Theodosian Walls were not breached during the 4th Crusade, in fact the city was handed over in a coop of sorts that was months in the making by Alexius IV. Even Mehmed II's cannons could only pockmark the walls. So while the final fall of the city might be delayed for years, decades or even centuries it is arguably a foregone conclusion that it would remain a shadow of its former splendor. 


Ironically, Enrico Dandolo might be remembered as the saboteur of Venice as the sack of the city was instrumental to Venetian monopoly on trade and the birth of the Renaissance due to its recent acquisition of Ancient Roman texts and more contemporary Greek scholarship including those that fled the city. Therefore, we might see Genoa or Milan as the preeminent merchant republics which might rival the Netherlands at their height.

&gt;""The government has failed! The only solution is more government!""

It's not about prosecuting them. It's about allowing them in in the first place. Muslims raping people is a completely predictable consequence of bringing Muslims into another culture. The government DIDN'T restrict knowable rapists from coming in, rapists rapin' errybody up in here, stop letting rapists in. Other places should learn and stop letting rapists in before they have the same damn rape problem for the same reasons.

&gt; The problem isn't even with Muslims generally, it's specifically a subset of Pakistani immigrants responsible for rape gangs. Why then the collective guilt for all Muslims?

This is just not true. You need to get to understand Islam. Go study the life of Mohammed. Read some Islamic doctrine. Islam is submission to Allah, and conquest of others to bring them into submission to him. And not the ""convince everyone to agree with us"" conquest of Christianity, it's more like the ""kill everyone who isn't us"" conquest of Judaism, but without the mandate to a specific place and time in history. If you don't want to look at it from a perspective of understanding Islam, just look at the rape rates in communities with large numbers of Muslims throughout Europe. There's an explosive statistical difference that cannot be explained away. Look at what Muslims do where they're conquering territory today. Look at what they've done in the past. Rape always happens with conquest, but rape is particularly a part of Islam, because they're meant to subdue and Islamify places they conquer. Islam tells you not to rape - other muslims, that is. Raping a non-muslim isn't actually rape, because it's legitimate for you to conquer her and then you have a right to sex with her because you conquered her. The rape isn't the core problem, the conquering nature of Islam is. It's explicitly a violent totalitarian theistic statist culture, no more compatible with liberty than communism is.

You're right that RIGHT NOW we aren't seeing as much Islamic rape and violence in general in the US, because Muslims know damn well that they can't get away with it as easily here for the exact reasons you mentioned. But they're the same people, the same culture, coming from the same places - still behaving consistently with Islamic doctrine that tells them to bide their time and build their power and act peaceful until they are able to conquer the infidel.

&gt; Yes, but actually no. ""Benefit of the people"" is far too broad and vague. Literally every tyrant and dictator in the history of ever said their actions were being taken for ""the benefit of the people""---form Pol Pot to Kim Kong Un, from Idi Amin to Fidel Castro, from Pinochet to Hitler, all of them said they were murdering and oppressing for the benefit of the people.

&gt; If governments are to exist, they must exist with the consent of the governed for the purpose of securing individual rights---as our Declaration of Independence correctly said.

I agree, you put this much better than I did. I usually insist on defining the only legitimate purpose of government as maximizing liberty for the governed, IDK why I did not there.

&gt; Do you really trust the government to represent the will of the people?

No, that would be backwards. Whatever I think of the government (even if I'm an ancap) I must ultimately trust the people to kill the government if it's not representing their will. Of course people with any sort of power over us will tend to abuse it (government or not), we cannot shirk our responsibility to combat this.

&gt; No. Think this through. You're saying that me--a person with access to the labor and resources of many people--will be compelled to trade with (and acquiesce to the demands of) two individuals who have only their own person and the fruits of their own labor to offer. Why would I? What do you and Bob possess which would compel me to trade with you?

We are the only people around who currently believe in your liberty. We're your strongest trading partners, your mutual defense, and your best friends because we're the only people who share your culture. I'm sure you agree that ancapistan is inherently dependent on mutual cooperation and defense to have any actual advantage over just living in a country. Bob and I aren't particularly constraining you. We're only going to do this if you start allowing people who are anti-liberty to live on your property and thus enter our community. We understand that while the three of us value liberty, we're only three people, and if you bring in 40 communists, we're all likely to wake up one morning with our necks slit. We're not telling you you can ONLY do business with us, hell you can do business with statists, you just can't flood our community with statists and get us all killed or we're going to cut you off to save ourselves. Even if you feel safe housing tankies, given all the factors involved and the fact that we're only telling you not to do this one specific thing, the benefits of retaining your relationship with Bob and I will outweigh whatever you might gain from renting housing to tankies. If you still disagree with my scenario, feel free to modify it in your head. I'm sure you can agree with the fundamental point I'm getting at, like with the deliberately importing murderers example.

You're right that if our demands seem worse to you than going it alone, you'll go it alone. This is a huge part of why a successful ancapistan would by necessity have strong cultural unity and commitment to the core value of liberty. Without enough unity that people are willing to die defending each other, ancapistan falls apart and is conquered by conventional countries.

&gt; That's a very very interesting question, but one without an answer. I would point out, however, that the culture of liberty in statist systems is dying out the world over, where it ever existed in the first place. Can you honestly say even 50% of native-born Americans believe in liberty, as you understand liberty?

Without a complete and objective answer, sure, but not without an answer. Yes, liberty is in decline. So how is ancapistan going to happen? It will only happen if something like 1/3 of people want it. And if we continue bringing in people who oppose liberty, especially people who actively hate it and see it as innately immoral, that will happen some day because? You can't get a culture that values liberty more by adding people who value liberty less.

Yes.

&gt;Is any of this country thrive?

Compared to the USA? Absolutely! The US has been in a downward spiral for 45 years.

&gt;That's why US got biggest IT companies in the world

We invented the fucking computer, and have been ruining it ever since; why do you think your computer OS is such a piece of shit?

&gt;Give me at least one Europe IT company which can compete with mentioned firms

Company? Screw companies, I'll give on one person: Linus Torvalds. He has done more to advance IT than any company on Earth.

&gt;If we look back in our history the most development and research was actually done in most in-human system - capitalism

Actually, referring to IT specifically, the research was all military, from the original vacuum tube systems up through DARPA and the Internet.

Gee, why didn't some private company build Babbage's difference engine for 100 years after it was invented? **BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SEE A PROFIT IN IT!!!!**

AT&amp;T had the cell phone in 1973, but we didn't get them until the 1980s... after the government stepped in and broke AT&amp;T up.

In absolute wealth, yes; they have free college, though.

George didn't really care about the EU. He pulled interesting things from it, things that he liked, but he was more than content to let the EU do whatever it wanted.

Whats relevant though, is that when you are on your break, you are not allowed to any kind of work at all, you just have to rest.

according to this part i know this story takes place in the EU but it is not correct, you are allowed to drive for 4.5 hours straight and then indeed you have to take your 45 minute break, but let's say if you drive for 1 hour then get to your customer and do unloading for an hour this will not be added to your 4.5 hour drive time, so you would still be able to drive for 3 and a half hours after loading/unloading, now the kicker is here in the Netherlands (where i live) there is also the normal working hours law wich say that after every 5 hours you need to rest for one half hour,

&amp;#x200B;

so for example i'm driving to a client for 2 hours, then arrive do some loading/unloading for 30 minutes, then get back behind the wheel and drive for 1 more hour for the next customer, now the loading also takes an hour and half (slow client we all know them) so by normal working hours law here in the netherlands i am now required to take my 30 minute break, but according to driving laws i still should be able to drive for an hour and half. so i better take that 45 minute break at once then or i would only be able to drive for 1.5 hour and would need to take another break to follow the driving laws, wich would just be a huge time waste then.",True,False,False,,,0,1583077179,,False,0,{},fj6p9oi,False,t3_fbimvh,False,False,t3_fbimvh,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/fbimvh/no_paid_ovetime_you_say_ok/fj6p9oi/,False,,1590957799,7,True,False,MaliciousCompliance,t5_3boqz,r/MaliciousCompliance,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,

&gt; Why should we cooperate economically with a country that weaponizes people?

I think it's important for world leaders to understand why certain decisions are being made. I don't agree with Erdoğan's decision, but regardless, leaders should understand the motivation. At face value, it appears that in addition to the usual flow of migrants, Turkey has become over encumbered with Syrian refugees from the civil war over the last 8 years. This has destabilized the economy and put many others out of work for a war that ultimately was backed by countries across the world.

So the question is, who is responsible for these refugees? Only the countries next door? The countries that are still involved? The original instigators? The most powerful countries? It appears Erdoğan believes it is all countries that were involved, including EU parties. While they agreed in 2016, they did not seem to stick with finding a solution and let Turkey continue to handle it primarily with it's own resources. This, he seems to think, was not part of the deal (to be fair it kinda wasn't).

&gt;&gt;Yes, but not in this way. We are not an endless charity. We need other solution as accepting them all won't solve the issue.

While we might not be endless, we should muster anything we can spare. So if thats not the solution, what is? Do you have a better solution to this problem?  
  
&gt;I know that, but i dont see how that has to do with anything, this is a vacuous statement

&gt;&gt;You have to be blind or oblivious not to see what harm it does to EU then. Perhaps if you looked from wider perspective you would see it is a systematic effort by Russia to shatter EU by funneling migrants towards Europe and for Erdogan to use this as a platform to further fuel his popularity by portraying EU as evil. If your course of action is to lay down and give up to these foreign attempts to divide us then be my guest, but don't complain later when what we worked for as an Union for all these years starts to trickle away.  
  
So why not tell me what harm it is by bringing in not even that many refugees? because the only downside of accepting refugees are short-term loss for local jobs.  
  
&gt;The division is that right wingers are just afraid of immigrants and therefore economic prosperity so i dont really consider their feelings since they and their policies drag europe down anyway.

&gt;&gt;Am I supposed to believe that multitudes of EU citizens who are turning to populism and right-wing politics are all evil racist jackboot wearing right-wingers now? This is not as simple as you might think. People are fed up. They don't want this to continue. And you have zero right to demonize them because they don't share a similar simplistic view of the entire crisis.

I woudnt say they're evil, but people are usually ignorant and not informed about an issue, so they look for simple solutions (which right wingers give them), what they give is fear, that spooky brown people are violent etc. which is not the case. DESPERATE people are always violent, dont make them to be desperate and the wont be violent. People are not fed up, they're just drinking paranoia coolaid. I dont demonize em, i just know they're policies and objectively wrong, its not really their fault that they're uninformed.  
  
&gt;And this is not an RTS game. People are not faceless units you put in the system hoping for positive economic growth. As I'm not that knowledgable about economy myself, I'm just going to say this is far more complicated and I'm not sure where you get this idea that it always leads to positive growth.
  
Except it is, you dont have to be an expert to know the right answer, the professionals, ECONOMIC CONSENSUS tells us that immigrants boosts economy. Please, dont believe me, try to look what majority economists say.  
  
&gt;I don't really understand what you mean by that response but it's very shortsighted not to see the causality between mass migration and sudden turn to populist movements in Europe.

Telling Canadians whose families have been living here since the 18th or 19th Century that they live on ""Indian land"" is a concept that will only cause hatred between 2 people. 

In 2020, separating people into groups based on their genetics, their ethnicity and assigning them different rights is something the KKK and the Nazi would be proud of.

**That is not to say that the Aboriginal people have not been mistreated, in fact, similarly to how we've treated Japanese Canadians during the 2nd World War and how we treated the Chinese Canadians during the building of Canada's railways, we certainly owe them an apology and owe them the resource they need to develop their communities' economies and improve the welfare of their people.**

But we need to dispense with the ""This is Indian Land"" thing because:

* It is incredibly divisive and serves no purpose other that throwing oil on fire.
* The ""invaders"" are not going to return to Europe or Asia or the Middle-East.
* It is incredibly insulting to those whose parents, grand-parents died for our freedoms.

At the end of the day, it would be detrimental to the country itself since, through time, those who came before us, the so-called ""white men"", managed to transform Canada into what the international community agrees is one of the best, if not the best, country in the world.

It would be like finding a good doctor who solves all of your health issues and then kicking him out of the door once you are healthy.

Just imagining that the Aboriginal people could have been left alone in Canada without the protection of the ""white man"" against the expansionist policies of the U.S. is laughable.

Without the ""white man"", the Canadian Aboriginal people would be American... [And you don't have to wonder how well they would be doing.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoppisch/2011/12/13/why-are-indian-reservations-so-poor-a-look-at-the-bottom-1/#4412e9a13c07)

**Maybe that many Aboriginal communities are poor because of the Aboriginal political system.**

As land on reservations is usually held communally, individual Aboriginals cannot used it to establish personal credit, it is illogical to invest money in a home sitting on land you do not personally own. So they live in damaged, sub-standard homes.

Without private ownership of the land, individual Aboriginal people cannot use it as collateral for a business loan, a loan that would help them create wealth.

If they ban these kids from working then it may actually be worse for these kids since they would have nothing to do and they would not be making any money for their families. 

Why do people feel they need to impose Western customs and ideals on others. Everyone is not the same, and every country is run differently. Just because child labor is banned in Western countries does not mean it is bad everywhere else. Again, there are no fully functioning school systems in these countries.

Eh?

&gt;1) How can you moan about ""right wing brexit"" when the EU is center right? Its purpose is to promote capitalist neoliberalism in Europe. 

???  Brexit is (almost entirely) a right-wing thing. Most EU countries are currently right / centre right, indeed too much of the world is in my opinion. Why does that necessitate hatred of the EU?

&gt;It was set up as a poltical counterpart to the the communist bloc (NATO being the military equivalent). 

Not quite that simple. Here's a quote from the wiki - *""After World War II, European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated parts of the continent.""*

&gt;There is no free at the point of use healthcare in most of europe. 

I know, I've lived and worked in multiple EU countries.

&gt;You have to pay to see a doctor in Sweden, there is no legal aid in Croatia. Italy Spain Poland Hungary ect all are far more conservative than Johnson, in Poland abortion is illegal unless its rape or incest. Bulgeria elected its Tsar as prime minister. 

Shameful isn't it. 

&gt;So this idea that many SNP types have that the EU is some kind of counterbalance to the local rightists here is nonsense. 

Yet a left(ish)-voting country like Scotland would likely not elect former-Tsars and psychos who make abortion illegal etc etc etc, and being a member of the EU would provide securities and assurances (not to mention guaranteed rights) when it comes to employment law and food standards and so on and so on. 

&gt;2) The peoppe in countries in eastern europe that are not in the EU are pretty much just as poor as those not in. You might says ""that's cause communism and Hitler's genocide'. Fair point but communism ended 30 years ago and the people in ex Yugoslavia the Baltic and Bulgaria are all still poor by our standards (though not by African or Asian standards). That's plenty of time to catch up but they haven't. 

That's not correct, see previous comment. And how long is ""plenty of time to catch up?"" What are the former and current economic conditions of all the countries you refer to? And how are all the economies of the countries you refer to comparable?

&gt;3) plenty of other non EU countries have caught up with the UK. South Korea is richer than anywhere in eastern europe. And it like them only became a democracy in the late 80s. The Japnese treated them the way the Germans treated the Poles and it lasted for 35 years. Then less than 10 years after the war it was wrecked in the korean war. Despite all that S Korea today is a powerhouse. 

USA donating over 3100 million dollars and then some in the form of aid and military support to South Korea.

&gt;Same with Argentina which had a civil war 40 years ago and economy in the toilet. So if they could go from being from being borderline third world countries to frist world countries in 35 years why hadnt Eastern Europe done the same? Romania has more oil than Norway or anywhere in Europe (where do you think the Whermarcht's tank fuel came from?). What's stopping them? Why arent they as rich as Norway? Or at least Portugul ? South Korea has no oil and they did it.

*""Romania holds 600,000,000 barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, ranking 44th in the world and accounting for about 0.0% of the world's total oil reserves of 1,650,585,140,000 barrels.

Vou tentar exemplificar, digamos que o vírus esteja na sua mão, aí você sem querer passa no rosto (em uma mucosa, por exemplo, como o olho), a sua chance de contrair o vírus aumenta muiiito.

Agora pense em uma luva, digamos que o vírus se encontre na superfície da luva. Se você sem querer passar a luva no rosto, o vírus irá passar para as suas mucosas da mesma maneira, entende? Melhor do que utilizar uma luva, basta lavar as mãos com álcool gel, já que ele tem propriedade de eliminar o vírus.

Em resumo, se você não for funcionário de saúde, não faz muita diferença usar luvas, já que as luvas não possuem propriedade de matar vírus ou bactérias.

Why are you lying about this? We have literal evidence of FTTs shrinking economies in Europe. 

We know that taxing transactions at even .1% has an effect. Taxing transactions lowers the price of stocks. This is the same as saying it raises the price of capital to corporations. A higher cost of capital leads to less investment and that in turn leads to a smaller economy. You seem knowledgeable in economics so I’m surprised that I’m having to explain this to you. 

Not only does this hurt working peoples retirements, it also causes us to bring in net negative revenue to the gov. Given that Uncle Sam gets around 35% of the economy each year if the economy is smaller by, say, 1% at some future date then Uncle Sam will be getting 0.35% of GDP less in tax. If the economy is that 1% smaller as a result of the FTT then tax revenues are about 0.35% of GDP smaller than they would have been in the absence of the tax.

The European Union’s estimates were that the economy would be 1.75 to 2% smaller after the FTT than it would have been without it. So, using that tax revenues for the US would be roughly 0.7% of GDP less after the FTT. But, of course, we need to add the actual revenues from the FTT itself. But that $340 billion is some 0.2% of GDP. So, we gain 0.2% of GDP from the FTT and lose 0.7% from the effects of the FTT.

That isn't for you to decide. It is clearly laid out in the  1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees what a refugee is and the criteria they must meet. Back in 2015 when people like you were saying the same nonsense 80% of applicants were successfully deemed to be genuine refugees and given asylum. If these people get proccessed and it turns out their not refugees then and only then can they be deported.

&gt;The only terrible thing here is your education. Millions of them ?  That's simply factually incorrect, only small numbers of any of them  managed to escape and they didn't settle in any of those countries  permanently. In most countries they didn't stay for more than a year.

Caso queira estudar meeeesmo, aí é tentar prestar atenção na aula e fazer 200 exercícios de algum dos livros principais. Seu professor provavelmente vai recomendar algum. A maioria das pessoas que eu conheço que foram muito bem em cálculo, foi porque faziam muitos exercícios, muitos mesmo.

Em física eu gostava do livro do Halliday, ele é muuuito didático e tem exercícios difíceis que podem te dar uma boa base também.

Programação o segredo é adaptar seu cérebro, a medida que for fazendo exercícios você vai melhorando. Tem alguns sites tipo code academy ou videos no YouTube que podem te ajudar bem.

Como dica geral, pegar provas com os seus colegas e veteranos dos anos anteriores ajuda muito, pois você sabe melhor em que parte do conteúdo focar e que tipo de questão cai, se for do mesmo professor é bem capaz de cair até a mesma questão.
Não recomendo estudar em grupo a menos que você seja a pessoa ensinando. Quando ensinamos aprendemos bastante, pois temos que consolidar melhor para passar para o outro.

I use ethernet to reduce jitter, and cap any other device on the network to 10mbps in the router settings. I run shadow on a 25mbps as that's most stable for me and gives overhead and image quality at 1080p is good.

As for how it works shadow have data centers in the US and Europe. Your individual shadow is a virtualized machine and you get either a 4 core or 6 core CPU which runs collectively on a higher core CPU (the CPU is split). The GPU is a workstation card equivalent to a gtx 1080 or higher. From my understanding shadow encodes directly from the video buffer on the card to reduce latency. 

My opinion is shadow is good even at the boost tier, but the CPU could be better in terms of frequency cause IPC wise its on the same performance level of my thin and light laptop. So I recommend searching up benchmark videos with the card/tier you want to get and reducing the average FPS by 10 to 20 percent.

&gt; 
&gt; Why?

Begin from the premise that slavery is wrong, then work backwards.

&gt;&gt;If yer interested in getting to the truth, then do renters powerwash the grime off the siding or not?

&gt;That's irrelevant. We're talking about owning the land, not performing maintenance (which anybody could do, owner or otherwise).

Maintenance is a relevant benefit of ownership. Renters do not powerwash the grime off the siding, but the grime needs powerwashing.

&gt; I don't agree that private ownership of land is not theft.

Your argument is with the dictionary, not me.

&gt;The difference is between things that are artificial and things that are naturally occurring. You're implicitly suggesting that this difference is irrelevant, but it is, of course, extremely relevant.

Good grief. Tell me why it's relevant. I shouldn't have to ask. You are obviously unaccustomed to argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We can trust the Constitution because of its huge success.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Using that same logic, we could also trust the Bible, the Koran, and many other religious texts.

&gt;&gt;No. Religious texts are for individual spirituality so their 'success' is subjective and variable. The Constitution has provable empirical success germane to this conversation.

&gt;That just sounds like an excuse.

No, that's a reason.

&gt;What makes one sort of success more relevant than another? 

The success of the West, ushering in the defeat of starvation and child mortality and exposure, is a relevant success. Relevance is not only empirical, it's obvious, so your oblivity is noted.

&gt;And if you have such a standard, why do you need the Constitution at all, instead of just using that standard?

The cognitive dissonance has made your strawgrasping more desperate. Looking back at this thread, anyone can see you have no reasonable points and no game. This is a losing battle for you.

&gt;&gt;Where I live, the poorest people have food cards, shelter, schooling, cell phones.

&gt;Many of them could have better, if they weren't denied access to land.

No. The poor do better where there are protected property rights.

&gt;&gt;Poverty dropped precipitously since global capitalism took root

&gt;Capitalism has been successful despite private landownership, not because of it.

You have no data suggesting that. The correlation between private ownership and societal success is clear.

&gt;In the 1860s, Japan abolished the old feudal system and shifted government funding onto land taxes;

You don't fund taxes.

&gt;it subsequently accomplished the same industrialization in the next 40 years that Europe had in the previous 200.

Japan remodeled itself on the West, not geoism. Japan's success is due to capitalism, which is private property rights-protective.

&gt;Denmark in the 1950s implemented land taxes 

Denmark achieved success by being incredibly capitalist and never adopted geoism. Classical liberals are all for tax reform and not against land taxes. Denmark, with its low business tax and liberal regulatory environment, has much to teach us.

&gt;&gt;You will simply have to buy cheaper land.

&gt;But that land might not be in a place where I can afford to live (with proximity to jobs, etc).

People have been investing infrastructure in the now-expensive land for generations. You can't just demand that investiture be forgotten.

&gt;My point is that, if a person who lives alone in the world owns all the land, then it seems like when there are two (or more) people in the world, each of those people would own more than 0% of the land.

Your ability to own land is unhampered except by your own choosiness. You would rather have land that others have invested in. Sensible but unfair to such investors, whose investments are conducive to a functioning society.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And when Pol Pot rallied Cambodians with socialist promises, a lot of the Cambodians he rallied didn't get the state they were calling for. What we have to do is stop calling for powerful states.

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. Because the alternative is being subjected to the whims of powerful landowners.

&gt;&gt;No, and Cambodia the very worst example to make that claim. 

&gt;Yes, it literally is. That's the point of owning land. That's what makes owning land lucrative.

Growing food and selling that food is not subjecting anyone to your whims. Most people like food, goods, and services.

&gt;&gt;The landowners in Cambodia had no control over the populace, they just grew food for the hungry people

&gt;Then they weren't very effective landowners. (But I think I'd need to see some sort of source on this before I believe it.)

Cambodians, like Russians, Chinese, Ethiopians, etc., were not starving before socialism. Sources abound. Are you writing with a quill on vellum?

&gt;&gt;But somehow I think you are going to try to escape the inescapability with a crazy plan to control all land with a single entity, making that entity incredibly powerful as the only landlord available.

&gt;First, this isn't about controlling the land. It's just about sharing out land value fairly.

You're trying to sell it that way, but you're also making socialist claims like property is theft. 

&gt; If the state is not acting on behalf of the public, then it isn't doing its job properly, and must be changed (perhaps even with violent force). But not having one is not a viable option if we are at all interested in moral justice.

This is /r/Classical_Liberals, not /r/Anarchism.

&gt;&gt;There's no stealing.

&gt;Yes, there is. We are all born, through no choice of our own, into a world where the land is all owned by other people and we are beholden to them for our very freedom to stand on the Earth's surface.

Ownership is not stealing because that's not what the words mean. Ownership is proven to benefit society, and top-down control of land is proven to cause famines and democide.

&gt;If an evil scientist released a genetically engineered virus around the world that caused all babies from that point forward to be born deaf, it would be reasonable to say that those babies have been robbed of their sense of hearing.

If that was proven to benefit society, I would be okay with that.

&gt;&gt;Owning ≠ stealing

&gt;Not as a general rule, no. But private ownership of land is stealing, because land is not artificial.

Whether I'm planting a seed or planting irrigation, I get to keep the fruits of my labor.

&gt;&gt;You are not excluded from owning land.

&gt;Yes, I am.

There is literally [free land](https://www.cnbc.com/2010/11/16/7-Towns-Where-Land-is-Free.html) available.

&gt;regardless of whether they had any hand in making that change to the economy

Land works as an absentee investment, like most investments.

&gt;&gt;you didn't put any time or effort into that land so you don't get the fruits of other's labor.

&gt;I don't want the fruits of others' labor. I want the natural resources that were there by default.

There is unimproved land available, cheap. Land you did not improve yourself has been improved by others and is more expensive as a result. You do want the fruits of others' labor.

&gt;&gt;US Cities started as natural ports on navigable rivers, but spread outwards based on vicinity to that port and the burgeoning infrastructure

&gt;Exactly. The construction of the infrastructure just served as a multiplier effect on the land's value as a consequence of being close to natural waterways.

Infrastructure creates land value. Land that has not been invested in is cheap. I can only phrase that so many ways.

&gt;And yet you still don't see new cities popping up in random locations

New cities pop up all the time--nothing is random.

&gt;It's only efficient to build infrastructure on land that is already valuable.

Nonsense. You're done.

&gt;That's not what I want. I want a government that treats people justly and fairly.

Non, justement. La majorité refuse d'utiliser les outils à sa disposition pour pouvoir accuser l'opposition d'abus démocratique. C'est une méthode détestable puisqu'elle s'attaque au fondement qu'est la vie parlementaire, à savoir la tenue de débats. Le problème dans cette séquence politique, ce n'est pas l'usage du 49.3. Le problème, c'est que le but poursuivi est de décrédibiliser les institutions.

Ce qu'il faut comprendre ici, c'est que toutes les manoeuvres politiques ne sont pas démocratiques, et qu'il en est qui fragilisent ou menacent cette dernière.

Ce genre de mise en accusation (""opposition qui sabote"", ""démocratie impuissante"") est un classique des attaques contre le parlementarisme, une des étapes classiques qu'on peut trouver dans les régimes qui connaissent un tournant autoritaire. 
C'est d'autant plus préoccupant qu'on a déjà vu cette majorité utiliser les mêmes méthodes pour saper d'autres pilliers de la démocratie comme la presse ou la liberté d'expression.

Quand elles sont menées par l'opposition, ces attaques sont généralement peu efficaces, puisqu'elles sont démenties par une majorité fonctionnelle. Mais quand la majorité décide de mettre en scène une démocratie inefficace et de la critiquer, l'opposition n'a pas les moyen de l'en empêcher.

&gt; C'est toujours pareil : jusqu'au moment où tu veux passer quoi que ce soit qui soit à la fois important et diviseur.

Encore une fois : temps législatif programmé. Ca n'existe pas pour rien, c'est là pour ça. Aucune des lois du mandat n'a eu besoin d'un 49.3 jusqu'à maintenant, et la raison est simple : le gouvernement n'a pas à lutter contre une fronde, comme c'était le cas sous Valls.

The Holy See deals with a huge amount of sensible diplomatic information -there's a reason journalists call the Vatican ""The Listening Post"", for information from all across the globe passes through it. The practice of keeping a sealed archive that only opens after several decades have passed (in order to be more or less sure everyone involved has already passed away or that the information won't really cause any political or diplomatic incident) was thus developed. Similar methods are used by multiple agencies and governments around the world. The Church was just the first to develop it, since it was also more-or-less the creator of modern diplomacy.

People hear the word ""Secret Archive"" and immediately think ""Occult Conspiracies"", but the word actually means ""Private"" as in, this is the Pope's personal repository, documents and letters sent to/by the Pope, a lot of them dealing with administrative stuff, but some of it being correspondence with nuncios, ambassadors, world-leaders, etc, the latter being the more sensible ones.

Think of it this way: in the 1700's popes most likely got letters from kings, cardinals, bishops, and ambassadors from all over Europe, dealing with information on potential wars, invasions, social reforms, theological conflicts, etc. Furthermore, the popes themselves were heads of state of a huge chunk of Italy, themselves often involved in alliances, wars, secret treaties, etc. So a large amount of the pope's personal documents were more than just documents of national security -they were of continental, sometimes even planetary security. In that context, it made total sense for this rule to develop; wait 70 years, and probably every war, treaty, plot, or dispute mentioned has likely already sorted itself out, every king and cardinal involved long dead already.

You can correct me if I’m wrong, since I’m not an expert on Europe, but I believe your foregoers paid a lower tax rate which would have helped them save.

I can speak to this point. I am a public librarian in a smaller library in the Midwest, USA and one of my staff has the title ""Local Historian and Genealogist"". She does a lot of exactly what you think with that title: she maintains our library's local history resources (e.g. microfilm archived copies of the local paper, local high school yearbooks, early documents from the city's early days), is the go-to expert for such questions (we get more than you might think), hosts programs involving history both local and in general (e.g. an adult book club that mostly reads history non-fiction), and more, in addition to the more general librarian duties of circulation and reference (which everyone does).

Although the local historian wasn't working, yesterday I had a person come in looking for local history resources. I know enough about what we have to get her started, but if she is still interested I will make sure she speaks with the historian. I also have a regular patron who recently has been asking me for resources on various topics, such as general Medieval European/Early Chinese/Mesoamerican historical overviews, the economics of the Roman Empire, what life was like for a serf or peasant in Medieval Europe, etc. Having a decent history knowledge is helpful even as a non-historian librarian!

History, social sciences (e.g. I have a background in political science), and humanities all synergize nicely with public librarianship. Depending on what you want in life, it can be an excellent job for a historian. A well rounded library staff will have people with a diverse background: for example, I have a linguistics and poli sci background, which no one else have meaning I have some specialized knowledge and perspective compared to everyone else.

[],,FlashbackHistory,,,t,,,dark,t2_3vgvw52k,[],"There were cases of armies using and issuing lever-action rifles during the 1860s and 1870s. However, these lever-action rifles were used chiefly because they were the only repeating rifle available. As the technology for magazine-fed bolt-action rifles arrived on the scene in the 1880s, everyone adopted them, for reasons we'll get into.

Most people are familiar with the use of Henry and Spencer rifles during the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. However, there's an even more notable moment in lever-action history most people don't know about.

During the [1877 Siege of Plevna](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/plevna/theplevnadelay.html), Turkish troops used about 8,000-12,000 Winchester .44 Model 1866 rifles to great effect. Turkish soldiers carried two rifles in the battle: the lever-action [Model 1866](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/TurkWin.htm) and the single-shot, falling-block [.45 Peabody-Martini](http://www.militaryrifles.com/turkey/TPeabMar.htm). The Peabody-Martinis were used to hit Russian troop formations up to 2,000 yards away. Once Russian troops go within 200 yards of their trenches, the Turkish soldiers switched to their Winchester rifles and poured rapid fire into the Russians. Once the Russians got within 50 yards, the Turks fell back to their next trench line and kept firing. Although the Turks eventually surrendered, they'd managed to delay the Russian advance into Bulgaria for a full five months and cost the Russians 40,000 dead and wounded.

The fighting at Plevna was just one factor that pushed European countries to adopt repeating rifles of their own during the 1880s (e.g. the Krag–Jørgensen, Lee-Metford, Lebel Model 1886, and the Gewehr 88), although bolt-actions were universally adopted as the preferred form of repeating rifl.

Lever-action guns were used in WWI in some numbers, although there were used simply because bolt-action rifles weren't available or were more badly-needed elsewhere.

* [**British Contract Winchester 1892:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-S65d9bAmc) About 15,000 Winchester 1892 rifles chambered in .44-40 were used by the British, mostly by Royal Navy boarding parties and Q-Ship crews. The short, handy carbine was more useful aboard ship than a Lee-Enfield or a Long Lee. The first 1,000 were donated to the War Office by patriotic baronet. In February 1915, 9,000 more rifles were ordered, followed by 2,000 in May 1915 and 3,000 in August 1915. The British ordered 3 million, of which at least some were fired in anger. The crew of the Q-Ship that sunk the German submarine UB-4 blazed away at the U-Boat with at least one Winchester rifle from just 10 yards away!
* [**French Contract Winchester 1894:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9kPggzvYtg)  In September 1914, the French ordered 15,100 of these rifles in .30-30 from Remington (yes, Remington), their primary arms supplier in the United States, who then sub-contracted Winchester to actually build the rifles. These rifles were issued to artillerymen, railway troops, motorcycle couriers, and even the odd balloonist. Once again, the short lever-action rifles were compact and handy weapons for men who had to carry a weapon, but didn't expect to do much shooting. Because the .30-30 wasn't a French-made round and wasn't easy to get, the 1894s were never issued to combat troops. The logistical hassle was just too great.
* [**Russian Contract Winchester 1895**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4grSRn5wnHI) (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL9JKassTD4), as well): About 300,000 of these rifles chambered the Russian 7.62x54R cartridge were ordered by the Russians between 1915 and 1917 (about 70% of the 1895s ever made). These rifles were just some of the 4 million military rifles (including millions of Mosin-Nagants) Russia ordered from the USA during the war, something I've [written about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ai02kz/in_reading_the_family_romanov_it_is_said/eeqp70f/). It wasn't that the Russians thought the lever-action was especially good or especially bad. It was just that Winchester had the capacity to quickly modify its existing production line to produce a 7.62x54R version of the 1895. Building new Mosin-Nagant production lines in the U.S. was still worth pursuing, but it'd take time. And Russia needed rifles *now*.

Another point - Luxembourg is modeling the free to ride consult after Dunkirk, France's system. Dunkirk wanted to increase ridership, and after offering free rides, they increased ridership - by 60%. They had the capacity, they just needed the riders. 


Luxembourg is the most the most highly car dependant nation in Europe with 670 cars for every 1000 citizens. They don't have an extensive bus system and they don't run subways. The system exists of trams that serve major routes, only. The system has only been around since 2017 (it was cancelled in the 70s, and rebuilt in the new millenium), and as a result, their ridership is very low. It makes sense that they would push transit. 


Now, imagine if TTC was free and capacity is the same as is right now, and ridership spiked by 60%, just like it did in Dunkirk. 60% more people on the subway or streetcar during rush hour. 60% more people waiting to get onto an already over-capacity bus. 60% more people trying to get onto a crowded shuttle bus when tracks are being repaired or there is an issue along the line. In pure numbers, TTC already has roughly 1.7 million customers every day. A 60% spike in ridership would be about 1.02 million additional customers, or a total of about 2.72 million customers per day. The system might be free, but half the people who would want to ride would be unable to even get on a bus, streetcar or subway. The already over burdened system would literally be crushed. Turning away half their customers is no way for a business to survive.

For starters Chinese companies don’t respect intellectual property. Take a look at the Chinese car industry, they have companies that make direct knock offs of all the worlds biggest selling cars, for the Chinese only market.

To me it also comes across as western producers only winning (getting equal sales) because of the governments backing. It doesn’t suggest if the western producers will target high quality (reusable, reliable, repairable) products or low quality (disposable) products. If they target low quality then it’ll just be the same crap as Chinese made but a slightly higher price.

To me the only way western producers can get the upper hand is to target high quality products and blow the competition out of the water, but that in itself isn’t enough because if you sell a high quality repairable product then you eliminate resale, therefore reducing sales and loose the market to the competition.

If you introduce tariffs and quotas to imported goods for the aim of limiting cheap products on the market, then you’ll also have to give up something else in a trade deal. So not really winning, just shifting a problem to a different industry probably.

The only true way is to teach the consumer that buying high quality products which are reliable, reusable and repairable is the best thing to do. That in itself isn’t easy because there’s literally companies out there doing it now and not really succeeding.

Britain at the minute has limitations on what it can do due to EU legislation which prevents government aid to businesses and market manipulation. I hope that one thing to come from Brexit is that the government COULD help businesses with good ethical / eco friendly aims to succeed, this could be by teaching the consumer as opposed to direct aid to the business itself.

Albizia julibrissin (Persian silk tree, pink silk tree) is a species of tree in the family Fabaceae, native to southwestern and eastern Asia.The genus is named after the Italian nobleman Filippo degli Albizzi, who introduced it to Europe in the mid-18th century, and it is sometimes incorrectly spelled Albizzia. The specific epithet julibrissin is a corruption of the Persian word gul-i abrisham (گل ابریشم) which means ""silk flower"" (from gul گل ""flower"" + abrisham ابریشم ""silk"").

Albizia julibrissin was described by Antonio Durazzini. John Gilbert Baker used the same scientific name to refer to Prain's Albizia kalkora, the Mimosa kalkora of William Roxburgh.

All data I took came from Liquipedia and I putted it in Google Sheets, in the future I want you guys to give access to this file to fully explore all the stats across all PL matches played, until I have completed my project I will post some interesting stats along the way. If you have an idea for future stats that YOU would like to see just say it and I will look into it if this is possible without to much work. I hope you guys like this idea of these bans across the maps since I like making these stats ;-}

Most of the UK is still gonna look pretty much like the UK now.  And I really don't think that covid-19 and the stock market are going to be such a big deal over time.

But as to things that will change and what one might do about them:

* Brexit kills off a lot of trade deals.  Negotiate trade deals, one by one.  The UK is doing this and plans to continue, so this is pretty straightforward.

* I don't know what the EU will and will not object to; the geopolitics here seem to me to be one of the bigger wild cards.  What will the UK-Turkey relationship look like, for example?  Will the EU take issue with the UK building up blocs near the EU?  In general, what are the (realistic) geopolitical red lines for the EU moving into the future?  The UK is going to have to figure out what she wants her role to be and how she aims to secure her interests -- the UK's already announced a ""sweeping review"" of defense and so forth policy, and there's been reference to it on the sub.

* I've mentioned before that the UK doesn't have a codified constitution, and that a sovereign Parliament is something of an obstacle to any system with that.  The EU treaties, in combination with the assumption that the UK would not Brexit, formed something of a base for ""high law"" in the UK -- Parliament *could* leave, but as long as it was unwilling to, the issues go away.  However, now that foundation is gone.  So the UK might look at a constitution again -- she is one of the very, very few countries today without one.  I personally think that there are solid arguments for one, and you can hear people on this sub regularly making arguments about the basic structure of British government and what it should look like.  I've seen talk about the role of (or existence of) the House of Lords, a replacement for same, the role of courts, changes to the voting system, changes to the status of the constituent portions fo the UK, the role of the monarchy, civil rights guarantees, and on-and-on-and-on.   This isn't something with an immediate deadline -- but it's a matter that I believe that Brexit reopens, something and obviously it's a big and open-ended question.

* Farming is, based on what I've been reading about talk over ending subsidy and re-wilding, going to fall off.   ([""EU direct payments make up about 60% of the profits of UK farmers, rising to 90% for livestock hill farms and are worth £3bn a year in total.""](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/brexit-end-boom-in-farmland-prices-forecasts-say)) That means that some people will move from rural areas to urban areas.  I don't know how much of this will amount to farms merging and how much of it will amount to land coming out of cultivation.  If a substantial portion of land is brought out of cultivation, my guess is that this will be, for some of it, the first time in a long time.  In the United States, we had a vast wilderness, and chose areas to protect before they were settled, and so had some freedom as to how to structure nature preserves and the like.  In the United Kingdom, one has some ability to aim to re-create Britain as it once was -- which would be a very-long-term project -- or try to craft something novel, [as she did on Ascension Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BUDEUwx0hE).  It might look parklike or forest-like.  It might make it less-costly for the government or companies to buy land to build out road/rail/power transmission/data lines or other things that require a right-of-way.

* So far, the UK has been coasting on her existing immigration policy.  She's going to have to make some politically-difficult decisions about who to let into the country and on what terms.  I personally think that high-volume, skill-based immigration from around the world on levels comparable to that of Australia or Canada is a good idea -- for the foreseeable future, someone's economy and power is bound to their population -- but it's also obviously going to mash into some people's reasons for voting Brexit.",True,False,False,,,0,1583107464,,1583109365,0,{},fj88fo7,False,t3_fbzeui,False,True,t3_fbzeui,/r/ukpolitics/comments/fbzeui/what_change_would_you_want_implemented_if_the_uk/fj88fo7/,False,,1590984191,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,[],[],text,False,False,

One could start with the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which provided a legal avenue for American interventionism in the Central and South Americas should they, or any colonialist powers in Europe attempt to extend or consolidate their influence in direct opposition to US interests. This subsequently led (among others things) to the Britsh reasserting sovereignty over the Falkland islands and the blockading of Argentina by the French and British. The USA relied heavily on the Birtish navy to enforce the doctrine in its infancy, which is why British influence in Latin America went largely unopposed. 

The doctrine was heavily styled after British and French anti-colonialist strategies to stifle international competition from hostile powers. The Roosevelt Corollary solidified this ""Big Stick"" method, as it was called. With much of the legal ground work laid out, the US was free to assert itself more agressively in Central and South America, leading to interventions in Guatamala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela (among others) and the various ""Banana Republics"" that sprung up. The Iran-Contra scandal was a direct result of the Reagan administration's attempt to fund the Contras in Nicaragua with arms sales to Iran, directly at odds with the Nicaraguan populations majority support for the democratically elected Sandinista regime. The Philippines and Hawaii are hardly considered cases for ethical annexation. 

The invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians, armed by the US government, who were fully aware of how they intended to use them. The Iranian revolution of 1954, democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown by a coup supported by the US and UK, largely countering attempts to nationalize their oil industry. US support of Iraq in Saddam's invasion of Iran, where chemical weapons were used in direct defiance of the UN. 

WW1 was caused primarily by Europe's increasing destabilization, exacerbated by the US to some degree. Not to mention the stringent economic conditions imposed on Germany post-WW1, which historians largely agree helped foster an evironment necessary to produce the National Socialist German Workers Party, of which America, now considered the dominant international power, had a large hand in shaping. 

Support of Cuban dictatorships pre-Fidel, US policies post-Fidel, the Bay of Pigs/Cuban Missile Crises, weren't considered potentially detrimental to the entire world by the entire world at all.

The Vietnam/Korean wars. Aid to the Mujahedin against the Soviets, which birthed many of the extremist groups that America ironically uses as the primary excuse to expand it's economic and political interests today. Afghanistan, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia etc the list goes on.

Achei que vc entendia de direito. Lei: representa ""a justiça"", deve ser a mesma para todos. Legislação: Uma regra ""privada"", ou seja, uma regra que uma instituição legítima coloca sobre sua propriedade

Se vc considera uma instituição governamental como legítima, ele podem colocar uma legislação tipo ""todos menos ele podem entrar sem camisa"", que isso é ok, pq ela é a dona legítima de determinada área. Uma legislação, entretanto, não pode ir contra a lei

Uma diferenciação de idade para cargos eletivos é uma legislação da instituição que aquele cargo se refere, e não uma lei

&gt;O PROCESSO NORMATIVO é igual, ainda que o conteúdo seja diferente

O processo normativo ser PARECIDO não faz com que o conteúdo seja comparável. Ficar gritando isso não vai mudar

Há diferenças relevantes no funcionamento de ambos que faz a comparação não ser válida

Vc pode continuar gritando isso, se quiser, não vai fazer diferença

&gt;Banheiro: lei

Não, não tem lei pra isso

&gt;Da velocidade em rodovias: lei. Idade mínima pra aposentar: lei

Ambos são legislações/regras

&gt;O ""veículo grande"" não é o ""veículo pequeno"" porque o qualificador condiciona a referência a um tipo de existência particular. Se você aceita velocidades diferentes pra caminhão e pra carro você furou seu raciocínio

#
&gt;E condição do veículo é uma medida subjetiva, diferentemente de tamanho

Tamanho pra ser veículo leve e pesado não é subjetivo. Além disso isso tbm é legislação, já que se eu for dono de uma rodovia ela pode ter a velocidade que eu quiser

&gt;Ela existe sim e, o mais engraçado, tem suas raízes nos gregos tbm (especialmente Aristóteles)

&gt; March 1, 2020, 10:36 a.m. ET.ORESTIADA, Greece - Greece deployed military forces to the country&amp;#039;s northern border with Turkey on Sunday to fortify the area and to repel a stream of migrants after Turkey opened the floodgates to the European Union over the weekend.

&gt; The fortification of the border came after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey confirmed on Saturday that he was opening Turkey&amp;#039;s border for migrants to enter Europe, saying that his country could no longer handle the huge numbers of people fleeing the war in Syria.

&gt; Turkey&amp;#039;s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in a tweet on Sunday that more than 76,000 people had left Turkey for Greece - a drastically inflated number, according to ground reports from both sides of the border.

We’ve already established that the US doesn’t have a meaningful social safety net compared to other countries. You agreed you were wrong here. So any laziness here CANNOT be blamed on social safety nets. Rather, I think it’s fair to say it’s the lack of social programs in the US that cause laziness and hopeless because there is no way to get ahead. I mean, the US is famous for it’s lack of social mobility and structural poverty.

&gt; Youve proven fuck all.

I’ve proven you wrong your claim that the US is diverse and your claim that the US has more of a social safety net than most countries and your claim that the US does more for “nonwhites” than other countries. Look back, you conceded these point by not responding to them. I get it, you’re not an honest person or trying to act in good faith here, but get real man. If you’re this intellectually lazy, it’s no wonder you can’t get a job.

&gt;  your the problem there is no privilege here only hard work and responsibility.

Taking personal responsibility is only possible under socialism. Likewise, hard work is only rewarded under socialism. Why do you think the US does so poorly when it comes to social mobility, especially compared to more socialist leaning developed economies (Western Europe, Canada, etc). These are just facts. Countries’ like the US you are stuck in your place by birth. You can’t get a good education if you don’t have money. So hard work and responsibility will never help you improve your life. So people give up. Check out this timely video: https://youtu.be/M9_qFrcWeUU

If capitalism is so good, what are 96% of the poorest countries in the world all capitalist? And is the average socialist country richer than the average capitalist country? Why are people happier living in more socialist countries? It seems strange to me that you defend a system that has so repeatedly been shown to be such a failure.

&gt; Socialism does NOT work ask anyone from a communist country its all fucked

Huh? This is well documented to be false. In former eastern block countries, people who lived under both overwhelmingly prefer communism. Maybe don’t believe everything Fox and CNN feed you. Remember, the US media is hyper-conservative. Though, I don’t know why you’re bringing up communism here. Socialism and communism are not the same thing.

Over my 25 year career so far, I’ve worked with a lot of people from former eastern block countries. Almost universally they preferred it under communism. Most had to leave home and move to another country because capitalism had so decimated their country. I’ve also lived in a “communist” country — China — though it’s not communist by any measure. China is more capitalist than the USA.

&gt; Your the privileged one thinking you know what going on cause you read some articles written by lying people.

This is a sad statement. Looking at your argument style and constant grammatical errors, I’m guessing you are not very educated. Or is English not your main language? If so, you’re doing well. Learning a new language is hard. Either way, your argument style show a lack of grounding in reason in logic.

Once races are mixed up, one does not have a corresponding relationship with the higher levels, and he has lost the root.

When the transportation means were not advanced, it was difficult to pass through it. With the progress of modern means, all these are broken through.

&gt; Acid Junkies is a dance act from The Netherlands. Live, they present themselves with a mix of solid techno music, played live and edited and enhanced with fragments of all kinds of dance music, spanning the last 20 years. From synthi-disco, via EBM towards house and techno.

&gt; The Acid Junkies started in 1992 as producer Stefan Robbers' solo project. It was his way of saying 'thanks' to all the originators from Chicago that injected such large doses of psychedelia into house music. The Part 1 EP on Eindhoven's famous Djax-Up-Beats label became an instant success and soon the Acid Junkies were a real band.

&gt; The first Acid Junkie is Stefan Robbers, one of the main artists responsible for turning the city of Eindhoven from Philips Light Bulb City into Techno City through his records as Terrace, Florence and REC and of course through his own Eevo Lute Muzique label.

&gt; His partner in crime for this operation is Harold de Kinderen, who provided Stefan with the Roland TB 303 he used for the first Acid Junkies EP and who has been a full band member since that day. Harold used to be a DJ for a drive-in show and played drums in various local bands. These days the band is assisted occasionally by Ronald Spanjers, who has by now earned the nickname ""third Acid Junkie"". 
With Harold the Acid Junkies became a regular band, one that also performs on stage. Night after night they direct the crowd from behind their piles of analogue synthesizers on stage. The Acid Junkies can play an audience like one of their synths and can bring the biggest cynic into full-blown ecstasy.

&gt; And so the Acid Junkies became known as one of the best live dance acts throughout the world, with one exception. In their native Holland they were virtually unknown until a couple of years ago, when finally the Dutch gave up their fascination with foreign techno and embraced the Acid Junkies. Since then, they do there what they have been doing all over the world: play. They have performed live shows at just about every major rave in Europe, like Germany¹s prestigious Mayday, as well as major Dutch festivals such as Noorderslag, Lowlands and Dance Valley. The band also conquered Chicago, where they shared the stage with their one-time heroes Roy Davis, Robert Armani and Woody McBride. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Posies is an American indie rock band, originally from Bellingham, WA., United States, although all band members had moved to Seattle when the band gained prominence. The band's two core members, singers, songwriters and guitarists are Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow.

&gt; The Posies began as a set of informal home recordings by Stringfellow and Auer, but soon became a full-fledged band. Those early demos were released as the album Failure (1988). Mike Musburger and Rick Roberts joined soon after, allowing the band to play its first live shows in Seattle and Bellingham. The four then moved into a house in Seattle's University District. The band's first full album was their major-label début Dear 23 (1990). It was produced by John Leckie and features lush orchestrations for the songwriters' literate, clever, melodic pop with occasional hard-hitting guitars.

&gt; The Posies' guitars hit even harder on their third and fourth albums, 1993's Frosting On The Beater and 1996's Amazing Disgrace. These two albums are the band's most succesful and are still widely regarded as classics in indie rock and 'power pop'. 

&gt; The band's rhythm section underwent many changes over the years. During the recording of 'Frosting', Roberts left and was replaced by Dave Fox. During the 1994 European tour, Musberger left (new bassist: Joe Howard a.k.a. Joe Skyward), whole Brian Young took over on drums 

&gt; 
The 'Amazing Disgrace line-up' also recorded album #5, Success (1998), which failed commercially. The Posies went on hiatus while the members concentrated on outside projects, including solo albums (Stringfellow, Auer) and projects such as Lucky Me, Skyward and Chariot, while Brian Young played drums in Fountains of Wayne. From 1997 to 2001, there was only sporadic Posies activity, although two live albums saw the light of day: an 'electric' one (Alive Before The Iceberg, 1999) and an 'acoustic' one (In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In, 2000).

&gt; After a satisfying tour as a duo, Auer and Stringfellow brought the band back to active service, now with Darius Minwalla on drums and Matt Harris on bass. The new line-up recorded and released the studio albums Every Kind Of Light (2005) and the particularly well-received Blood/Candy (2010).

&gt; From 1993 onwards, Auer and Stringfellow also joined Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens as band members of 'power pop' legends Big Star, playing on many tours as well as the Big Star studio album, In Space (2005). 

&gt; The years 2010-2016 were a particularly dark time for The Posies. Ayer and Stringfellow's association with Big Star came to an abrupt end when Alex Chilton died in 2010. The Posies' 2014 incarnation included Darius Minwalla on drums and Joe Skyward on bass, but disaster would strike: on May 21, 2015, Darius Minwalla died suddenly in his home in Vancouver, from unknown causes. On March 26th 2016, Joe Skyward passed away after a battle with cancer.

&gt; The Posies, however, re-emerged with a new album (their 8th), Solid States, set for an April 2016 release. Read more on Last.fm.

By 2025, NATO, while officially not dissolved, is pretty much made useless by removing certain articles - the reasons for this are many, but are mostly found in the growing Turkey-US-EU conflicts. Following the 2026 financial crisis triggered by another spike in oil and metal, the US turns inwards and NATO goes down with it. 

The EU, as the result of the mentioned crisis, splits in two, with only the western part of it being able to hold together and partly federalize around 2026. 

The East African Federation, finally agreed by the member states, is formed in the same year, becoming a voice that can no longer be ignored in African matters. 

Russian conflicts continue with both Turkey and Ukraine, with only the Ukrainian conflict bearing any fruits. However, the Russian economy was already in a bad shape and then...

In 2027, the ITER project in France obtains economically viable and more importantly, sustainable, nuclear fusion. The discovery is declared state secret, and is kept as one, as the US - or NAS by this point - is currently suffering from the political aftermath of the shortest civil wars of all time.

The results of this discovery- coupled with advancements made in battery-tech, slow spread of fusion power and the creation of several energy-storing networks, seems to lead to an Utopia: global warming by 2034 is all bit slowing down. 

Beneath the crust of this new world, however, great - not all good - changes have come. China, now named the New Republic, is under the control of the greate rcompanies who had removed the CCP from power, the Northern Americas are united under a US hegemony, and the New European Union is born and expanding, which is held together by radical implementation of meritocracy or by questionable voting restrictions, depending on whom you ask. The East African Federation is busy fighting European, Saudi and Chinese influence- so far, they have been successful. 

However, nations whose GDP depended on fossils have been the great losers of this new era. Even though fossils are still needed for manufacturing of materials, the breakthroughs in nanotechnology and the growing anti-fossil movements, often aided by mostly anti-Russian factions, ensured that the GDP of these nations practically halved over a decade. 

By 2037, tensions grew higher and higher. The NEU, half-united, could not even rely on its own chain of command, but still beared one of the most advanced armies in the world. They have, however, engaged in a military pact with the New Republic and India in case of an unprovoked attack on either of them. 

However, Russian military officers had severely underestimated the commitment of the parties involved in the pact, which led to the world being forever changed. 

So when the so called East War came, the winner was never a question: it was only the amount of bloodshed. 

With Moscow, Kiev and four other cities lost to nuclear weapons, the East War was a brutal conflict, barely lasting three days. Marked by the usage of heavy bomber drones and AI-led tactics, the East War was the end of an era, and a beginning of a new.

Russia was divided between the NEU and the New Republic - what was left was barely a remnant. The Middle East was now under Saudi and Indian influence, with Africa undergoing the Big Boom in the aftermath, with the Federation now being elevated into a major political power. Most of the Far East falls to the New Republic, and the NEU is already looking towards south. 

A lesser welcome change occured in South America - Brazil invaded a sizable portion of Argentina, and much of the continent is now locked in a bizzare three-way Cold War, where the NAS, reactivated on the global scale, is supporting its own factions.

Jusnaturalismo *de quem*? Existe uma dúzia. De Finnis certamente não. Nem de Cotta. De quem?

&gt; ""Raízes"" era uma palavra naquela frase, sabia?

Raízes nos gregos, **especialmente no stagirita**. Foi você quem trouxe o nome do Aristóteles, eu abri o Ética e mostrei que ele defende a proporcionalidade e a noção de equidade antes da noção de igualdade.

&gt; É engraçado qdo vc começa a se irritar e xingar as pessoas, como se vc fosse o dono da razão e tals.

Me mostra que você é o dono então, mostra aí que ""legislação"" é lei positiva e que ""lei"" é lei natural. Aliás, mesmo as leis naturais assumem também a forma de dispositivo normativo (""não causar dano ao inocente""), se está ou não positivada no ordenamento é outra discussão. Aí o nome correto é ""lei positiva"" mesmo. Você não pode usar a palavra no teu sentido privado que ninguém mais usa na doutrina e achar que vai existir diálogo -- pelo contrário, qualquer interlocutor informado vai te dizer que você tá usando palavras reservadas de forma equivocada.

&gt; Mostra aí então minha citação dizendo que Aristóteles defendia esse princípio especifico para justiça. Se eu realmente falei deve ser fácil achar

    Fun fact: Ela existe sim e, o mais engraçado, tem suas raízes nos gregos tbm (especialmente Aristóteles)

&gt; Ou pelo menos, o que ela deveria ser. Conceitualmente, a lei deveria ser justiça, pq é pra isso que ela foi criada

Lei é o conjunto normativo. A justiça é realizada no caso concreto segundo as fontes do direito, entre elas a exegese do texto da lei. A justiça se realiza também sobre costumes na ausência de texto legal. O Bastiat coitado deve estar se revirando no túmulo quando você faz a defesa legalista de que todos os veículos devem obedecer ao mesmo limite de velocidade ao invés de cada veículo poder trafegar na velocidade de segurança segundo suas próprias capacidades automobilísticas.

Act as shocked as you want; you are absolutely deluded if you think there is *more* violence, world-wide, as the result of ""atheists killing in the name of atheism"" than Religious people killing in the name of their religion. If you try to claim that, it is a blatant disregard for the truth, or a willful admission that you are irreconcilably biased.

&gt;So your telling me the belief that when you die NOTHING happens has absolutely nothing to do with mass murderers actually going through with it.

Absolutely. You're trying to assert that, somehow, the lack of belief in an afterlife makes an individual *more likely to commit violent crimes* out of some sense of ""escaping punishment""? That is a ridiculous, fallacious, and completely unsubstantiated claim. Religion, by an incredible margin, encourages more violence on a mass scale than any other organization - and that's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of **fact**, and here are numerous studies demonstrating that fact, if you're going to try to deny it:
