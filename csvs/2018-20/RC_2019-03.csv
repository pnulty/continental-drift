Ok not a crime case but when I was doing my Masters, my dissertation involved surveying for slow-worms, (c[ute little legless lizards](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEP8AbrVbCY/maxresdefault.jpg) that live in the UK and some of mainland Europe that don't really do much, not rare but no one knows how many are around because they're quite elusive and hard to track since they don't really do much other than burrow, eat slugs and occasionally pop up) to survey for them the easiest thing to encourage them up is to place pieces of felt or corrugated iron down as they will bask under them,

We had two sites, one a small, private site where a relocation had taken part (They're a protected species so if they show up when you want to do building you have to mitigate) and the other was a few patches in a woodland which was our 'wild' site. So on a visit to the woodland I'm walking around with my project partner and the supervisor. My supervisor notices some of the sheets he placed is missing. We notice a group of people have set up camp (Which actually you weren't really meant to do there) and he asks 'Have you seen any sheets of metal lying around?' 

Them 'Nope, not seen any'

He found the missing sheets right there, piled up for their campfire and how can you tell they belong to us?

Io potrei elencare tutta una serie di ragioni per cui la merda italiana, come dice lei, é di fabbricazione autoctona, non europea. I problemi li abbiamo creati noi, non la UE. L'Italia fatica ad attrarre FDI rispetto ai suoi pari europei, e questo non per l'Europa cattiva, ma perché non conviene investire in un paese dove i contenziosi legali tra aziende vengono risolti con tempi biblici e dove i governi dimostrano poca serietá e affidabilitá cambiando le carte in tavola in corso d'opera.

Le delocalizzazioni sono frutto della globalizzazione, non dell'Europa. A casa mia, a Bologna, un'azienda che produceva telai per la Ducati ha chiuso perché quest'ultima ha ingaggiato una societá vietnamita. Le risulta che il Vietnam sia nella UE? O la Cina, altra grande destinazione per le delocalizzazioni?

La sovranitá monetaria? E' un feticcio di voi sovranisti, roba che neanche la bacchetta magica della fata turchina. Peccato che per voi sovranitá monetaria voglia dire svalutazione monetaria. Un giochetto che funziona nel breve periodo ma di cui l'Italia ha abusato per decenni e che porta piú problemi che benefici.

L'Italia ha basato molta della sua concorrenzialitá sul tasso di cambio mantenuto bassissimo per decenni nei confronti dei suoi pari europei e americani, col risultato che gli imprenditori locali hanno smesso di investire in R&amp;D, i dipendenti a salario fisso venivano colpiti duramente, l'inflazione viaggiava a tassi doppi rispetto a quelli attuali e con oscillazioni piú sostenute e i lavoratori italiani si ritrova(va)no con il potere d'acquisto piú basso tra i paesi del blocco occidentale (cosa che permane, vedi Renzi che diceva ""investite in Italia che gli ingegneri italiani prendono poco"").

Senza contare che l'Italia é un paese senza giacimenti di materie prime, quindi quelle le doveva comperare sul mercato internazionale con prezzi denominati, nella maggior parte dei casi, in dollari.

Ora che i paesi emergenti come la Cina, l'India e il Sud Est Asiatico sono entrati in competizione con noi, il giochetto della svalutazione non funziona piú. Sia perché i Cinesi fanno con il renminbi la stessa cosa che facevamo noi, sia perché noi non possiamo competere con il costo del lavoro asiatico.

L'introduzione dell'Euro ha messo fine ad un trucchetto che avrebbe smesso comunque di funzionare, perché una volta che i mercati si globalizzano e i paesi emergenti entrano in competizione con noi, non cambi i meccanismi macroeconomici da solo. Non ci riesce la UE da sola, figuriamoci l'Italietta di Salvini e Di Maio.

&gt; Uno che ignora l'uso della svalutazione per sostenere l'esportazioni e il fatto che l'euro abbia negato questa possibilità creando problemi al Paese è un cazzone che non sa di cosa parla. Ogni riferimento è puramente casuale.

It's not a discussion when you refuse to engage with modern scholarship on the issue.

Salaries are often lower. Here's a page [with some averages for software engineering](https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/it-salaries-software-developer-trends-2018), which is the field I'm in.

At the same time, the cost of living can be higher. [This site compares the US and Germany](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Germany/United-States/Cost-of-living), costs look pretty even based on their numbers, but like I said, it depends on your field. Like I said, the US is more lucrative in my field.

Further problems are that, in any country, it can be difficult to get decent jobs without knowing the language. Even though English is widely spoken as a second language in Europe, you can't work in a technical field where the rest of the office speaks German or French without speaking passable German or French. You see this in the US as well, there are lots of foreign-born engineers in the US, but they generally all speak English at work.

The same issues exist with visas and work permits and such as everywhere, you need to get permission and possibly sponsorship to work in the EU if you're not a citizen, which you don't need if you stay in the US.

I love Europe, and will visit many more times, and could even see retiring or owning a summer home there, but the logistics of working there don't make any sense as a US citizen, especially without fluently speaking any European languages.


As a summary, here are some difficult things to do:
1. Find work that can be done solely in English.
2. Get legal permission for that work.
3. Learn the local language (you'll want to do this regardless of your work situation).
4. Pay taxes (do you need to pay US and European taxes?)

There are other things to, like visiting family now requires an international flight. Can you afford that?

Not that any of these can't be overcome, but I feel like you need a reason to make it worth it. If you actually love the culture of a place so much, it could be worth it, but culture varies a lot by location (even within different cities in a particular country), just like it does in the US, so you won't really know if you like a place until you've been there.

There are plenty of minor conveniences and inconveniences as well, which all vary locally as well. Do you like your big car? You'll likely have to give that up. For that matter, do you like not paying highway tolls? Highway tolls are all over Europe and cost a ton, along with expensive fuel. Do you like the food? Sure, in Italy they have lots of good Italian food, but not a ton of take-out Chinese or tacos. You likely can't even find the ingredients for these in the grocery store.

For that matter, do you like your washer and dryer? Most of southern Europe line-dries their clothes.

RolandBuendia,1488158842.0,,,[],,2∆,dark,text,t2_15rdwm,False,"I think you are overstating the influence of the US in this crisis.

While the US sanctions do not help, the fact is that the Venezuelan economy is simply not competitive. Hugo Chávez was lucky to be president while the oil prices were at record levels. And what did he do? He used these royalties to perpetuate himself in power, pumping up welfare programs towards his political base, and prosecuting his enemies, instead of diversifying the economy or investing in infrastructure. I have met people who fled Venezuela during the “good years” of Chavez.

Once the oil prices went down with a bang, already under Maduro a few years ago, the Venezuelan economy collapsed. And the government saw itself without the means to buy even the most basic items such as medical supplies or food. As a result, the government popularity collapsed. This is when they started playing fast and lose with the constitution and elections. Not a single international organization came forward to say that the last presidential elections were fair and square. Quite the contrary, it has received widespread condemnation. As an example, even the European Union has called for new elections.

Guaido claims to be an interim president, as the leader of congress, because the constitution says it should be the case, when elections could not be held. He is in it just to order a call for new elections. Not to be one a president for years to come.

To call him a US puppet, would also be the same as to call him a puppet of the European Union, pretty much all of Latin America, Japan, and most of the free world. Maduro has only the support of Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba. Not exactly the best examples of democratic governments.

.

I have long been of the opinion that one of the worst outcomes of the Thirty Years' War was the fragmentation of the Low Countries. What a marvelous counterfactual had those countries managed consolidate and serve as a counterweight to the Germanies, France and England.
.

But of course Europe and the Old World in general has as long a history of atomization as it does of consolidation. That is why you get people self-identifying as a Walloon or Flemish. (Or Catalan, or Tuscan, or whatever)  As the American philosopher P J O'Rourke pointed out it seems ""Everyone with a lisp and a pet name for God wants his own country."" 
.

This strikes New World people as odd. Our nations have always been multi-ethnic, multilingual and with few ideas of a national religion. You can be an American, Brazilian or Argentine without adopting the national language, faith or dress. 
.

Yes, New World People did their best to wipe out the indigenous people. This is all the more vivid in our history because it is such a strange thing. 
.

In the Old World, governments tend to have a national ethic identity. Germany is a place to be a German. At some basic, DNA-level you are expected to conform. America is a place to have a good time and get rich.  Nobody much cares if you look like an American (whatever that means) just pay cash. 
.

It is hard to find examples of that in the New World of a desire for an ethnicity-pure state. There are some. In the Old World there are endless examples. 
 

The European Union had long worked against this. After the trauma of two world wars, and under the threat of a multinational threat to the east, Europe moved to become one. 
.

It worked great. Two generations did not see a war. Wealth increased. But now spurred by ethnic identity, economic problems, and perhaps Russian meddling the pressure to break apart is increasing again. 
.

To us New World people, it all seems quite odd and against self-interest. An independent Catalonia for what good purpose? Sure, the internal arrangements of Europe are for the Europeans to decide, but after setting the world on fire three times, we would have hoped you had moved on.

&gt; Angus &amp; Julia Stone are an Australian acoustic folk-pop duo consisting of siblings Julia Stone and Angus Stone from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Their decision to collaborate was taken at the beginning of 2006. Prior to that, both had performed as solo artists at open mic nights but utilised the other as a backing partner.  Ultimately they came up with the same idea, “Why don’t we play together? It kind of made a lot of sense”. In terms of composing the material, they write on their own, then work together on structure and harmonies.
They have released three studio albums, A Book Like This (2007), which peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart; Down the Way (2010), reached No. 1; and their self-titled album (2014). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 they won five awards from nine nominations: winning Album of the Year, Best Adult Alternative Album, Best Cover Art and Producer of the Year for Down the Way and Single of the Year for ""Big Jet Plane"". 

&gt; Released in March 2010, their album “Down The Way” debuted at #1 on Australia’s ARIA Charts enjoying a remarkable 12 months inside the ARIA Top 20 albums chart. It went on to pick up Album Of The Year at the 2010 ARIA Awards and includes the platinum selling Single Of The Year ‘Big Jet Plane’; which was most notably voted No.1 on the 2011 annual Triple j Hottest 100. The album has hit triple platinum (210,000+) sales in the Stones’ home country, the only Australian artist album to reach this milestone on the current ARIA Top 50 albums chart.

&gt; European audiences have also fallen head over heels in love with “Down The Way”. Reaching platinum (100,000+) album status in France, supported by a hugely successful film sync with ‘Big Jet Plane’ for the movie, Les Émotifs Anonymes. Extended sold out tours are not limited to native Australia with the 2011 French tour including 5 ‘Le Trianon’ Paris shows selling out 2 months before the tour commenced. The UK, Germany, Austria, Spain &amp; Portugal are all just a taste of the frequent European tour destinations with sell out shows. In the US, their dramatic and lush soundscapes have found homes on prime time dramas; Grey’s Anatomy and Private Practice and key slots at iconic US festivals Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo and Coachella.

&gt; Travelling has been an integral part of the Stone’s musical story, so it’s not surprising they opted to record “Down The Way” in a number of diverse locations around the globe; an old sawmill on the river banks of Fowey in Cornwall, a studio in Brooklyn, a water tank in Coolangatta, London - and Queens in New York. 

&gt; “Down The Way” marked their debut as producers, taking full control of their sound without losing the spirit of what made the first record ‘A Book Like This’ so special.  There has been a subtle shift of gear, represented by a growing confidence in their abilities as artists and the music follows suit as it flows easily through sparse and rich textured arrangements without losing any of its etherealness and charm. 

&gt; With an incredible response to “Down The Way” from all corners of the globe, Angus and Julia Stone will take some well-deserved time off and prepare for their next step along a remarkable musical journey.

Do you know why Europe and the Commonwealth have social medicine (which has cured my GF of cancer and birthed her son, and taken care of her family for the cost of $39 per month)?

It’s because Europe was destroyed in WWII.

Prior to their ruin, they were just like we are, with profitable private insurers. Like Lloyd’s of London, who practically invented insurance.

But when WWII happened, everything was destroyed and the nations of Europe were in Total War. At that time, if you were a doctor, you were an army doctor. If there was a safe hospital, it was a military hospital because everything was total war. And when the smoke cleared and the rubble was shoved away, there were a lot of sick and wounded people and only the government could step in to help. 

So that’s why they have social medicine while we do not. We were never destroyed, like that. And so unlike them, the profit-based system of public health and welfare was able to merrily chug away as it still does, with you sending pay to Aetna or Blue Cross or whomever and they *still* fuck you.

1) When Israeli soldiers commit a war crime, they are punished accordingly (as well they should be). They are not celebrated, they are not hailed as heroes. They do not profit in any way from their crime. They go to prison.

2) Conversely, when Palestinian ""soldiers"" commit murder and other war crimes, they are rewarded handsomely. They are not punished in any way whatsoever. They and their families are paid money that comes from aid from the US and EU (taxpayer money) in perpetuity. They are hailed as national heroes and celebrated forever. 

You probably don't like that, because it doesn't fit your narrative, but those are FACTS. That is a stark difference. Here is another... an Israeli soldier committing a bonafide war crime is a rare event. By contrast, the commission of war crimes is literally a way of life for Palestinians. The Israeli leadership is never calling for their soldiers to commit war crimes. Conversely, Palestinian leadership openly calls for murder and genocide on a daily basis. There is no equivalence here.

That's a neighbourhood in Cairo called Manshiyet Naser. It's where the Christians live: the Coptic sect, an ancient form of Christianity from when Egypt was part of the Roman Empire. 

Their neighbourhood is literally full of garbage. They process it on the ground floors of those buildings and resell it, mostly to buyers in Asia who reprocess it for use in manufacturing.

The Muslim areas are mostly nicer, but still shabby. I went to a wedding in a sort of upper-middle-class apartment complex near El-Ma'adi and I'd say it was slightly nicer than being in a Soviet era suburb in an Eastern European city.

\- Swoosh on the right side of the left shoe is covering the letter A. This is **good**. The swoosh should be touching/covering/or be virtually right next to (with no gap) the letter A in USA. [https://imgur.com/1WdeUoQ](https://imgur.com/1WdeUoQ) my retail AHE for reference.

\- Swoosh on the sole of the left side of the left shoe and right side of the right shoe is **placed like my retail**: [https://imgur.com/t24LLRE](https://imgur.com/t24LLRE) This is good. It should only be the bottom portion of the swoosh on the sole. A lot of fakes will have it too low.

\- Sizable gap between the pointy part of the swoosh and the leather where the laces come out on the  left side of the left shoe. This is **good**. Here is my retail for reference: [https://imgur.com/PNPuxIp](https://imgur.com/PNPuxIp) A lot of reps will either hit or miss the mark on these by having it way too close to the leather where the laces come out.

\- **Would like to see the right side of the right shoe**.

\- NIKE on the back of both shoes **have correct placement**. Current fakes have it where it's in the middle, but authentic pairs have it just a tad bit down. Here is mine for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/kUtjZw1](https://imgur.com/a/kUtjZw1) The NIKE impression and the fuzziness around it is hella clean too. Indication that these are legit.

\- **Tan have correct text placement**. Text placement of laces should be like this: [https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0/See](https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0/See)how ""SHOELACES"" is close to the ends? Most reps have it far away. No fakes have this perfected yet. They have it close, but not 1:1

\- **Need pictures of the teal laces laid out to see text placement**. 

\- Plastic on toebox is **nice and curved**. This is good. A lot of Fakes it have where it's bigger and it's not a perfect curve. [http://imgur.com/a/BcGwPCq](http://imgur.com/a/BcGwPCq)this is an example of a fake AHE toebox. All of them have this.

\- Ziptie is nice and thin. This is **good**. Retail ziptie is supposed to be thin like. My retail [https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0](https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0). Fakes will have it where it's thick.

\- **An indication that these are legit is that the shoes have a bell curve looking at the heel**. All fakes right now lack that curve. This is the most distinguishable difference between fakes and retails as of this writing. [https://imgur.com/tuEvgrk](https://imgur.com/tuEvgrk) and [https://imgur.com/mwOHBEW](https://imgur.com/mwOHBEW) See how the fake (grims) is ""fat"" while the AHE has the body of an instagrm model?

\- Padding on the opening where you put your feet is thin. **This is good**. Fakes have it thicker while retail is thinner: [http://imgur.com/a/7B7KmaX](http://imgur.com/a/7B7KmaX)

\- **No picture of the insole to see size sticker**. I know that US, AUS, and EU have their respective size stickers. [https://imgur.com/a/bzVeSSy](https://imgur.com/a/bzVeSSy) Retail for reference. Your paid must not be from the locations listed.

Here’s why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol’ American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let’s see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren’t looking at it–you’re looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it’s because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you’re going to say: “But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!” Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Ela e sua irmã Reem* mudaram de endereço pelo menos 13 vezes, vivendo em um limbo jurídico e com o medo constante de serem mandadas de volta para um país que poderia puni-las com a morte.

As irmãs sauditas, detidas em Hong Kong depois de fugirem durante as férias em família, disseram à BBC que sofreram abusos violentos em casa e que foram tratadas ""como empregadas domésticas"" por parentes do sexo masculino.

Violência doméstica
-------------------

Com idades entre 18 e 20 anos, elas cresceram em uma ""típica família muçulmana"" na Arábia Saudita, onde as mulheres são colocadas sob tutela e muitas vezes acompanhadas de perto. Ambas não viam nada além de um ""futuro sombrio"" para si mesmas.

""Eles observam cada passo que damos, controlam todos os detalhes da nossa vida"", diz Rawan.

Elas, que assumiram pseudônimos para proteger suas identidades, renunciaram ao Islã, alegando que é uma religião que ""deixa os homens controlarem as mulheres"". Essa renúncia, de acordo com as leis sauditas, é considerada um crime punível com a morte.

Os diversos casos recentes de mulheres sauditas em tentativas de fuga da violência de suas famílias chamaram a atenção da comunidade internacional.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  As irmãs sauditas têm 18 e 20 anos   Longo planejamento
------------------

Há seis meses, as duas irmãs estavam a caminho da Austrália para pedir asilo, quando autoridades diplomáticas sauditas as interceptaram durante uma escala em Hong Kong.

As mulheres disseram à BBC que estavam economizando dinheiro e planejando sua fuga desde 2016.

As irmãs esperaram por uma viagem em família ao Sri Lanka, que coincidiu com o aniversário de 18 anos de Rawan - quando tiveram mais chances de ter em mãos seus passaportes, que seu pai mantinha trancados em segurança em casa.

Sob o ""sistema de tutela masculina"" da Arábia Saudita, uma mulher precisa de permissão para obter um passaporte, viajar para fora do país, estudar no exterior com uma bolsa do governo, casar, sair da prisão ou até mesmo sair para centros de acolhida de vítimas de abuso.

Em setembro passado, elas conseguiram ir em sigilo até o aeroporto internacional de Colombo, no Sri Lanka, vestiram calças jeans e embarcaram em sua jornada para a Austrália.

Mas enquanto se preparavam para a conexão de voos em Hong Kong, ficaram retidas por homens que pegaram seus passaportes e disseram que o voo havia sido cancelado.

----------------------------

Reem e Rawan dizem que se lembraram de Dina Ali Lasloom, que foi detida a caminho da Austrália em abril de 2017 e retornou forçosamente à Arábia Saudita do aeroporto de Manila, nas Filipinas.

O paradeiro de Lasloom é incerto, apesar de ela ter passado algum tempo em um abrigo em Riad.

As irmãs dizem que se recusaram a ser intimidadas pelas autoridades sauditas em Hong Kong.

""Não éramos um alvo fácil, conhecemos nossos direitos"", disse Reem. ""Eles são os únicos que fizeram a coisa errada, não nós. Só queremos sobreviver.""

Elas discutiram os planos e se recusaram a embarcar em um avião para Dubai.

As irmãs conseguiram seus documentos de viagem de volta, mas naquele momento eles estavam dentro da área de trânsito do aeroporto de Hong Kong sem nenhum voo marcado.

-------------------------

Reem e Rawan são o segundo caso rumoroso de mulheres fugindo da Arábia Saudita só neste ano.

Em janeiro, o Canadá concedeu asilo a Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, de 18 anos, que ficou presa no principal aeroporto de Bangcoc, na Tailândia, tentando chegar à Austrália.

Ela se recusara a voar para o Kuwait, onde sua família estava esperando, e se fechou em seu quarto de hotel no aeroporto, atraindo atenção internacional.

A ONG Human Rights Watch registrou diversos casos de mulheres tentando fugir de suas famílias nos últimos anos, sob o risco de enfrentar ""uma vida de abuso"" quando são forçadas a retornar.

De acordo com as estatísticas mais recentes citadas pela agência Associated Press, 577 mulheres sauditas tentaram fugir de suas casas em 2015.

Mas é provável que o número real seja muito mais alto, porque muitas famílias não denunciam as fugitivas devido ao estigma social, informou a AP.

---------------

""Quando começamos a ver outras sobreviventes que fugiram para outros países em busca de asilo, achamos que era possível também [para nós]"", diz Rawan.

""Há pessoas que nos inspiram.""

Na Arábia Saudita, elas ""não tinham dignidade"", diz ela.

""Eles me obrigaram a cozinhar [para eles] desde que eu tinha 12 anos. Quando minha [pequena] irmã nasceu, nós a criamos.""

As irmãs dizem que foram constantemente humilhadas pelo pai e pelos irmãos do sexo masculino, que também as castigaram com espancamento.

""Minha vida era apenas para servi-los. Eu estava muito deprimida, não via nenhum futuro, eles não se importavam com nenhuma das minhas necessidades ou com minha educação - o único foco era me criar como uma boa esposa.""

--------------

Desde que entraram em território chinês, as irmãs dizem que foram perseguidas por sua família e pelo consulado saudita.

Com os passaportes agora suspensos, elas solicitaram um visto de emergência ""em um terceiro país"" e aguardam a ajuda das pessoas, comendo macarrão e se preocupando com seu futuro incerto.

""Nossa vida em Hong Kong é basicamente nos esconder, nos esconder o tempo todo. Nós nos mudamos 13 vezes: albergues, hotéis, abrigos, casas das pessoas"", diz Rawan.

""Temos medo de ir a qualquer lugar por nossa conta. É tudo envolto em medo.""

'Fora das sombras'
------------------

Apesar de todo o imbróglio, as irmãs dizem que agora estão ""fora das sombras"".

Reem, que estudava literatura inglesa na universidade, diz que sonha em escrever sobre as vidas das irmãs na Arábia Saudita, escrevendo poesia e descobrindo o mundo.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Ao menos 577 mulheres sauditas tentaram fugir de suas casas em 2015   Ela diz que também sonha em ""viver em um país onde respeitam as mulheres e os direitos humanos"" e onde possa falar livremente.

Rawan também diz que só quer ""viver em segurança"" e levar a ""vida feliz"" em um país onde pode fazer escolhas.

""Eu sonho em completar meus estudos, sou realmente apaixonada por eles"", diz Rawan. ""Eu quero estudar biologia e ter um doutorado em genética.""

&gt; They weren't making this decision because they are some caring  organization, ensuring everyone is safe. They know Tigres fans and their  whole family will turn up in droves, that is why they are chopping the  stadium in half. 

1. Organizations can make decisions for more than one reason. Getting ahead of problems and trying to create the best environment possible is not necessarily exclusive to trying to make money (which then goes back into the team and club). 
2. If their fans are going to show up in droves, why implement a policy based on denial of that fact?

&gt; So if we did go with my 3,000 allocation you honestly think we would all  of a sudden have 10,000 people being thrown out? Fights breaking out?  Even though modern football history tells us that even the most  passionate of fans have never created this situation because of home and  away sections 

My comment was referencing some of your other points in the thread (admittedly not clearly), in which you suggest the Dynamo security should be removing disruptive fans:

&gt;If you’re a Tigres fan and buy tickets in home section then know you can  be removed from the stadium, if you sit and don’t react, no problem   
&gt;  
&gt; you put at the bottom of the purchase agreement that the tickets are  solely for Dynamo fans. If there is any disruption from away fans in the  home section you are removed by the stewards    
&gt;  
&gt; The stewards around the field are not just there to stop pitch invasions but to direct staff to trouble in the stands   
&gt;  
&gt; A Tigres fan sits there and does nothing then I don’t really care. I  have been the away fan in the home, you just have to be a good little  boy if not I knew what was happening to me. 

If seats aren't allocated correctly (in this case generously), there's a greater potential for trouble to break out. That in turn requires more personnel, especially if you plan on being hardline and removing fans that don't fit a certain level of decorum, which is what you yourself are suggesting should be the case. 

&gt; I'm not skirting the ""containment"" idea, again, it's not rocket science,  you place them in the away section, in the corner. Extra stewards  create a barrier between them and the home, using empty seating as well. 

I'm not sure why you keep bringing up other leagues, especially European ones that have a much longer history of soccer and more ingrained supporter's culture, but I've seen the Dynamo do this plenty of times as well. It's not a new idea, as you point out yourself. The thing that you're ignoring is that the normal rules don't apply. Tigres fans are going to attend the game, period. If they were given 3,000 seats in a corner they'd buy tickets elsewhere. These fans don't often get the chance to see their team play, and they're going to take the opportunity not only for club pride, but in some cases out of national pride as well. 

&gt; This is about a team that consistently given the option of, setting a  better standard, long term success or a quick buck, choose the quick  buck every time 

Better standards and long term success often come as a result of running a profitable enterprise. At the end of the day this is a business, and making money is the bottom line. If allowing Tigres to have half the stadium brings in profits that allow us to get a 3rd DP or even TAM player, then the gambit succeeds and fosters better performances and long-term success. 

Keep in mind that we also have a new CBO and Chief Revenue Officer. They were brought in for a reason. They've already made improvements to the stadium and game day experience, and they're going to try new things to see what works.

There IS  a risk of cancer, but you have breasts you have a greater risk of cancer! 

&amp;#x200B;

But if you remove your testis you will have to take hormone therapy the rest of your life. Is that worth it for you? Many doctors don't make that clear- thats a choice YOU can make!! Don't let doctors convince you to have surgery. You DONT have to have surgery if you don't want to!!! PLEASE KNOW THAT!

Please be careful. The medical world is still quite backward when it comes to Intersex people. They want to do surgery first, force it on you. But really what intersex people REALLY need is Therapy. Counseling to understand who they are, and what that means.

It has become increasingly harder since Freedom of Movement. FoM has made immigration skyrocket unsustainably in a short space of time and this has made immigration a big political issue within only a relatively short amount of time. 

In order to try and control the numbers, the rules for non-EU immigrants have become increasingly more painful. We can’t control EU immigration so we control non-EU numbers. EU numbers then increase even more steeply. Rules for non-EU immigrants become more and more cruel and unjust in a vain attempt to stem the overall numbers. 

Now, EU immigration will plateau. Maybe rise gradually at times. No more need to have horrible rules for non-EU immigrants to try and stem the overall numbers. The Home Office has a huge backlog and can’t cope with processing these horrendous rules. It’s unsustainable. The rules are unsustainable. In time, the rules will soften for them. For everyone.

There definetly is a lot of cooperation between the countries, its especially great for traveling and making new friends. Only be aware that that isnt especially noticeable in every-day life but something you will most likely only experience when traeling or working in an international company. Also, there is alot of openness and many accepting people, you will quickly find a young and vibrant scene in any bigger city. Only be aware that in Europe, just as everywhere else there are still narrow-minded people and there is also some national drama all of the time, you probably just dont hear about that as much in the US. And it maybe doesnt impact life as much as in the US, I dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

I definetly dont want to discourage you from coming here, you sound like a lively and passionate young person so you are most welcome :) 

I only want you to be aware that its not just a dream, that you think of all the practical aspects of it. Where exactly do you want to live? Maybe make a list of places and what you know about them and if you realize you dont know much about a place, look it up, go to the subreddits and ask people. Make sure you know how you can support your life, how are you going to earn money here? Do you need further education (likely if you are just 18 years old)? What are the exact regulations on your visa?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And I did thinking about going to school there witch I heard isn’t that expensive. 

I can only speak for what I know from Germany, University here is quite cheap (\~250 Euros a semester for which you will also get a semester public transport ticket for your city/state) but hard to get into, especially if you dont know the language. You have to have a good highschool degree for most of them. You should really think about what you want to do here because for almost everything you will need some type of degree, be it from a university or an apprenticeship.

&gt;This might be my only change to go and live there so I really want to take the chance even if it’s a long and hard work ahead

You might be right on the first part and you are definetly right on the second part. Learning the language and adjusting to the new culture, learning new things will be hard but if you keep at it will be worth it.

The power of the ruler stemmed from the people, not from the God. 

This concept that laws and rules of day-to-day conduct are given legitimacy only through the will of the people was a tremendous shift with far reaching implications. Religion was pushed over to become only one of the things influencing the public discourse instead of THE THING. The trauma of religious wars in 16th/17th century greatly accelerated this process as the religious tolerance was grudgingly accepted as the way to live - which means religion was moved over to the personal domain as opposed to overwhelmingly public domain as it was before.

GrahamDSC,1479717861.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_12yrl7,False,"Firstly - you need to take another look at the definition of 'shill' - it most certainly is an insult.  

You'll note that on the Asian Le Mans TV coverage I wear the Series shirt - that's because they employ me to commentate, explain and enlighten.  There is nothing false about the information I am giving out, and my relationship with the most important consumers of the information, the teams, shows absolutely zero sign of any irritation that I am getting it wrong.

You would be correct about there needing to be a plan for a season - however, the difference between the single seater team owner you cite and the reality of international sportscar racing is that for very many of the professional teams in sportscars an entry in the biggest races is an absolutely essential part of the multi-million dollar/ euro/ pound commercial package - with the exception of one-offs like the Macao Grand Prix, single seater racing is commercially viable ONLY over a full season.

It is possible to formulate an international sportscar racing season without the biggest races - but in my experience, those teams with ambition inevitably have to target, budget for and fund the big ones - LM24, Daytona, Sebring, Spa 24, Nurburgring 24 etc etc in order to attract the drivers, sponsors and eventually factories to come and play.

Ref your comment on container loads - that's a very different model than occurs in IMSA - for the IMSA teams it is not containers (which can be transported by multiple third party carriers) - but their own haulers, with their own staff - that do the literal heavy lifting - That is a significant additional investment in hardware, transportation and staff costs.

WEC has the same for most teams for the European races with containerisation for the rest, and a calendar that has been designed to ensure that for the most part seaborne freight is used - Not cheap, not even a little bit, but not nearly as expensive as air freight (though some teams do choose to do that instead for some races).

Asian Le Mans is an entirely containerised Championship - again hence the choices ref calendars and gaps in the calendars. 

I believe you are confusing David Chen (from GT team TSRT) with David Cheng (from Jackie Chan DC Racing) - I'd be interested in just how successful or otherwise you think that (JCDC) programme has been on the sponsorship front - I suspect you may be surprised!

Ref sponsors and WEC/ LM24 - you are very, very wrong about their expectations and their own activities - take a look at any WEC race paddock, hospitality area etc - there is activity - sometimes considerable activity - bit nothing even on the same planet as Le Mans.  That's not the organiser's choice, its the sponsor choosing - Nobody is stopping them from spending money at Fuji, Silverstone etc - it is simply not their primary, or often even their secondary, priority.

Finally - ref not enough attention being given to the ELMS etc - in 2019 we'll have an entry capped at 41 cars - including 18 full season LMP2 cars - it seems the teams are pretty happy that they have a plan that they can sustain.  In Asia we saw 50% growth year on year for the Asian Le Mans Series.

WEC is a whole different ball game - as a global product it relies on factory money, and global sponsors, to push it forward - though the professional LMP2 and GTE AM teams are a massive chunk of both the budget and the 'show' - the key is finding something sustainable that the factories can hang their hats on - And it's there that the powers that be have not done a great job in transitioning from the days of Audi vs Porsche vs Toyota, nor in having a structure in place that allowed others to easily join in at affordable start-up budgets.

The next few weeks are going to be interesting - and critical

How Brexit Britain Managed to Lose All of Its Friends
March 01, 2019

The sight of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a self-professed “best friend” to Britain, berating Theresa May’s Brexit strategy this week was telling. Even at a time when France and Italy are at diplomatic loggerheads, Viktor Orban is painting the European Union as a menace to society, and Ireland’s Big Tech-friendly tax model is under fire from the European Commission, the bloc’s 27 member states have more or less stuck together in talks with the U.K. They’ve certainly toed the negotiating line laid down by Brussels.

All of this matters as Theresa May considers requesting a possible delay to Brexit. Given that she would need the unanimous support of EU leaders, there will be strings attached.

May has used up a lot of goodwill over the past two years. She kicked off negotiations with unpleasant hardball tactics, misjudged Britain’s ability to extract trade terms with the EU that were just as good as being a member, and pressured other leaders to sign off on a draft deal in November that she herself has undermined since.

Her January promise to return to Brussels and renegotiate an Irish border provision that she’d only just agreed enraged many in the EU capital. Philippe Lamberts, an member of the European Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, told me afterwards that the U.K.’s unreliable behavior demonstrated exactly why the Irish backstop was needed, and that European unity would hold. It has.

It’s pretty damning that the U.K. has failed to build any coalition within the EU that might help sway crucial votes or support its case. Core members like Germany and the Netherlands – despite facing respective hits of 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) and 4 billion euros to yearly exports if Britain crashes out without a deal – were quickly alienated by the U.K.’s logic-defying demands for preferential access to a market that it wanted to leave without stopping it from signing its own free-trade deals.

And while smaller pro-British countries such as Poland and Hungary have been among the country’s most outspoken supporters, they’ve consistently defended the indivisibility of the single market and their own citizens’ rights. As net beneficiaries of EU funds, they have good reason to stick to the Brussels script.

The central and eastern states that might have found common ground with Britain as a tough ally against Russia and a check on the dominant euro-zone countries like France and Germany have failed to rally to its cause on Brexit. Faith in the broader NATO umbrella has probably outweighed fears that Britain will drift away from military cooperation into isolationism. Most are driven by fears of being left behind by closer EU integration rather than inspired by Britain’s break for freedom. Poland’s criticism of the Irish backstop found little endorsement in the region, according to European policy academic Monika Brusenbauch Meislova, highlighting May’s forlorn task in trying to find cracks in the EU’s united front.

What happens next? As the debate moves from the terms of Brexit to whether Europe will allow May a few months delay, European unity is likely to hold, according to Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European Studies at Oxford university. If there’s evidence that this will help get May’s withdrawal deal over the line, much will depend on Germany, where lawmakers have expressed support for an extension of a few months. But if May takes negotiations to another “no deal” cliff edge after that, her isolation may prove fatal to her own political career.

When did other EU countries begin their planning for a No Deal Brexit? 

At that point it's foreseeable.

 *Govt could have issued a prior information notice (at any point up to 6 months before}) that allows it to carry out a quicker tender process. They gave ferry companies two weeks to submit bids. You can give companies 15 days on an accelerated procedure and be compliant. 

So Brexit was foreseeable and the timescales still worked if the Govt issued something earlier about the possibility of going out to tender. They could have done so when they were engaging with ferry companies when scoping it out. 

I've done an accelerated procedure before, its not difficult (it takes a few hours to issue a PIN if you need to look things up - like how to do one), it's basic incompetence.

The other issue would be prior case law (NGS vs Transport Scotland - IANAL) received advice that 4 months is required for a standard tender, start to finish.

The federal budget is 4 trillion dollars. Unfunded liabilities are what? 100 trillion? Maybe you're talking the favorite topic of the brainless child: healthcare. Well, you should go check out the OECD figures that show public expenditure for healthcare in the USA represents a full 50% of all dollars spent. Compared to all your ""socialist"" countries that spend 60-70%.

It's so ironic how supporters of capitalism always talk about socialism being nice on paper but looking completely different in practice. Your ideal ""free market"" capitalism has never existed and will never exist. This is what capitalism looks like in practice. Nobody cares about your moral or hypothetical arguments in favor of free markets and unrestrained competition. What the actual capitalists care about is making money, and they're smart enough to figure out that they can make a lot more of it if they get the state to tilt the table in their favor. Even if you could hit a big reset button that got rid of all government corruption and regulation and taxes, we would be right back where we are now within a few decades. The driving force of corruption is the capitalists themselves, not the state.

&gt;And here we go: look how great Europe does it right? Actually, you have to cherry pick pretty hard to find a European country that isn't on the verge of bankruptcy. When you find one, the population is probably the size of Colorado. Fuck you guys all have the same stupid arguments. 

States literally cannot go bankrupt under normal circumstances. As long as people believe your state is stable, you can always just issue more bonds and devalue your currency. The only reason bankruptcy is a potential problem in Europe is because they're locked into a currency they have no control over. It has nothing to do with their welfare policies.

&gt;You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Regan merely cut taxes and slowed the regulatory steam roller and it created an entire new industry worth trillions of dollars that has massively - massively - improved the standard of living for the entire world.

.

Few thinkers can speak about global governance with as much authority as Kishore Mahbubani. A former President of the United Nations Security Council, Permanent Secretary of Singapore’s Foreign Ministry and Dean of the renowned Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, he has been named “the muse of the Asian century” and listed among the top 100 most influential public intellectuals in the world by the Financial Times

.

**Q: How should the US and Europe position themselves in a global system dominated by Asia?**

A: Europe and the US need to face the fact that the last two centuries of Western dominance have been a historical aberration, and that aberration is coming to a natural end. They need to be ready to deal with a world in which they remain strong, but in which their relative share of global GDP has gone down. If your share of GDP goes down, you need to adopt a new strategic approach, 

.

**Q: The US is increasingly focusing its ire on China’s Made in China 2025 strategy. What is your view on this strategy?**

A: I think it’s legitimate for China to aspire to become a technological superpower in its own right. Frankly, I think that China is going to succeed. The US should not complain about what China is doing, and instead ask itself what the American response should be. But here, the ideology of people like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer—who believes that all government-led industrial policies don’t work—gets in the way.

If industrial policies don’t work, then why not allow this one to fail? If you complain about it, that suggests you believe it’s going to work. Now, if it’s going to work in China, why doesn’t the United States launch its own comprehensive national strategy to maintain its technological lead? Instead of complaining about Made in China 2025, they should have a Made in America 2025.

.

Q: sentiment among the US elite has turned against China. What has caused this change?

A: I don’t know, it’s mystifying, but it has happened. I think there is a growing awareness that China is becoming bigger and stronger. Even though Americans don’t like talking about America becoming number two, subconsciously they must realize that America is moving toward that status. Instead of looking in the mirror and asking what mistakes you have made, it’s always easier to find a scapegoat, and China is the obvious one. The danger is that when you look for a scapegoat, you ignore the core structural issues that America has to deal with in this new era.

First of all, Europeans still had to get to and from their trading posts. If they weren't on good terms with indigenous peoples in the surrounding area, this could be a daunting and dangerous task depending on how isolated the individual post in question may have been.

Also, not all trade occurred at trading posts. I don't have the exact figures to cite right now, but I believe that throughout much of New France, for example, the majority of trade was actually carried out by licensed *voyageurs* and independent *coureurs de bois*, who traveled via canoe and over land to trade directly with indigenous peoples. This was inherently risky work and it demanded being on good terms with the indigenous peoples whose territories these Frenchmen were crossing.

Finally, even accepting the idea that imperial powers were primarily concerned with trade revenue, there were other issues at hand that involved indigenous peoples. For example, territory in the Americas regularly changed hands into the 19th century, and indigenous peoples were an important part of these power struggles. European powers, and especially their representatives actually on the ground in the Americas, understood just how much power indigenous peoples tended to hold, and actively courted them as allies during war and even peacetime. This often involved gifts, including manufactured goods (and, especially in the later colonial era, guns). Once again, turning back to the example of New France, the French gave so many of these gifts that they actually lost money on their colony for quite a while, this because it was more important for them to retain ""power"" by keeping their indigenous allies from turning toward the British instead.",True,False,False,,0,1551450849,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehk0m30,False,t3_avrfln,True,t1_ehjp3hz,/r/history/comments/avrfln/how_do_we_know_how_the_borders_of_the_countries/ehk0m30/,False,,1555202343,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,r/history,public,

willdeletein2020,1551165515.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3avtuugv,False,"A 12-year-old boy raped his six-year-old sister because he wanted to re-enact a scene from the video game Grand Theft Auto, a court has heard.

The boy is said to have attacked his victim on numerous occasions at their family home while adults were in another room or asleep, including on Christmas Day.

One incident was apparently triggered after the child watched footage of a sexual act in the game, which has an 18-rating under the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) classification scheme.

While it is unclear which scene the boy was attempting to replicate, controversy has long surrounded the ability for players to pick up sex workers in the game and perform a range of acts with them. 

Swindon Youth Court was told he had decided to recreate the scene by raping his younger sibling, who had been in the room at the time.

The incidents were uncovered after the girl confided about what her brother had made her do to a friend at school, who then told their teacher.  

The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared before a judge to admit three counts of rape and one of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity.

His mother looked close to tears as the charges were read out in court, holding the boy’s hand before he was given a 12-month referral order.

If he completes the order in the out-of-town therapeutic facility where he currently lives, the four charges to which he pleaded guilty will be removed from his criminal record.


His defence lawyer, Gordon Hotson, said the centre represented a “one-off opportunity to sort this young man out”, adding he had been “opening up to staff and working well with them”.

The boy, who is from Swindon and has since turned 13, sat impassively for most of the hearing, but smiled when the judge spoke to him about football – a sport he hopes to play professionally one day.

The judge also asked what he would do if he had the opportunity to commit his crimes again, to which the teenager responded: “I would stop myself, I have learned that it’s wrong.”

**Prosecutor Russell Pyne told the court: “He had been watching sex acts in porn and wanted to see what it was like for himself.”**

Republicans have opposed Medicare for all, have wanted to cut social security, wanted to cut welfare and food stamps (which affects whites in republican states more than anyone else), funding to public schools etc. 

This where I know you have no economic knowledge. Deficits are nothing more than when the government spends more than it takes in. Tax cuts are often the biggest contributors to deficits because the gov then has to borrow money which adds to our national debt, which is different than the deficit. That’s how the deficit increases. We do not receive the same income and most of those tax cuts go to outsourcing/Research/stock buybacks, things that don’t benefit most Americans, so it doesn’t have the same impact on the economy.

Just be virtue of being picked in the second round, any type of NBA production is appreciated. For reasons why, well... Bolden's versatility on defense has shown me the sky is the limit on that side of the floor. He can already switch on to wing-ish type players and he's shown some rim protection and shot blocking. His problems are that he's undisciplined on defense for which he commits too many fouls, does not have enough strength and weight to defend larger players, does not create enough turnovers with his length, and does not have the box out abilities needed to stop offensive rebounds. Very little of these shortcomings scare me, because he will grow more comfortable, he will grow more disciplined, he will gain weight, and he will get smarter.

Offensively, he's improved significantly since the start of the new year, where he's shooting upwards of 35% from three, and has attacked closeouts to get to the rim. In europe and summer league he showed real passing ability, hopefully we some of that one day. He attacks the offensive glass, but it's pretty fruitless and I personally care more about him getting back on defense. 

Right now he's not very good. He is not nba ready yet, the team needs him to be a center, he is not a center. He is a 4 right now. He struggles making quick reads in the pick and roll defensively as a center, and has show better weakside shotblocking and nice smothers then straight verticality. He doesn't rebound as a center because he's never played against the big centers of today. He's our best bet against Ibaka/Horford/Lopez with Jo out the game. But will also get eaten alive if Horford/Gasol/Lopez post up.

TheSukis,1466873629.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_z09fb,False,"In the strictest sense, pedophilia is sexual attraction to children.  We consider children, in this context, to be individuals who have not yet hit puberty.

Once a human body has made it through a sufficient portion of puberty and possesses the physical characteristics of being sexually mature (i.e. able to reproduce effectively), it is natural for adults to feel sexual attraction towards that body.  This generally is around age 14-16 for girls and 16-18 for boys, although it can vary significantly.  Having sexual feelings for people of that age does not make one a pedophile, and is in fact quite normative from a biological standpoint.  What *does* make one a pedophile is sexual attraction towards pre-pubescent children whose bodies have not yet sexually developed.  That is an abnormal and pathological type of sexual attraction, and we consider people who experience that attraction to be pedophiles.

It's easy to conflate the illegality of engaging in sexual activity with a minor with pedophilia, but the two are not the same, as the age of consent in some places is higher than the age at which sexual maturity is reached.  Remember that the distinction between adult and child is something that varies significantly based on sociocultural values, and that this distinction has varied significantly even within single societies over time.  For example, it would have been quite normal for a 30-year-old male to have sex with a sexually mature 15-year-old female throughout much of European - and even American - history.  I point this out to emphasize that adult sexual attraction to post-pubescent adolescent bodies is biologically normative, and that its illegality in some societies does not change that fact.

Now, just because it's natural for an adult to feel sexual attraction towards a sexually mature 15-year-old doesn't mean that it's ok for that adult to have sex with such a person.  In making the determination of whether an adolescent is ready for sex, we consider other factors than sexual maturity, such as whether the individual is psychologically prepared for sex (and many/most 15-year-olds are not) in addition to the possibility for an imbalanced power dynamic.  So, although it may be completely natural and normative for an adult man to *want* to have sex with a sexually mature 15-year-old adolescent, it may also be illegal and immoral.  That person would not be a pedophile, even if they acted on the urges; in the latter case, they would just be a criminal.

I actually think that we need to do a better job educating people on this dynamic.  The problem with telling adults that sexual attraction towards *anyone* under the age of consent is abnormal and indicative of pedophilia is that adults who experience that attraction (as many of them do) then feel pressure to repress their feelings.  This leads to a dynamic in which the adult may experience shame which may, in turn, lead to the actual sexual behavior (something along the lines of ""if I'm a creepy pedophile because I find 15-year-olds attractive then screw it, I'll act like a pedophile).  Instead, we should be teaching that it's normal to feel attraction towards any sexually mature bodies, but that it's not ok to act on it for a number of reasons.",True,False,False,,0,1551458417,,1551458799,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehkbisv,False,t3_aw1esx,True,t3_aw1esx,/r/clinicalpsych/comments/aw1esx/a_question_for_psychologists_and_the_likes_what/ehkbisv/,False,,1555207469,2,True,False,clinicalpsych,t5_2snee,r/clinicalpsych,public,

Pack light with lots of space if you plan to shop, and, in the UK, get a 407 form when you buy stuff and keep your receipts  if you want a VAT (tax) refund (you can do this at the airport and it’s worth it if you buy a lot.) 

Travel wise, here’s my ten cents on the places you’re planning. I did an exchange semester in Germany and worked in Spain and I’ve been to most major Western European cities a few times because of that, but I’m definitely more “tourist” than “local” knowledge wise.

Museums in London are free and outstanding and that’s always what I do if I have a few days in London. My favourites are Victoria &amp; Albert, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Tate, but you can’t go wrong. There’s a million things to do there, of course, but I always just end up museum-ing (and wandering around the really posh neighbourhoods and the City). 

I looooove Berlin and imo to really appreciate it you should take a walking tour with a guide so you can hear all about the Cold War stuff. I am not usually into that kind of thing but I think it really helps understand the place. I had amazing luck vintage shopping in Berlin, which is also not something I usually do. It’s the coolest place and it has the weirdest bars I’ve ever been in, which are worth investigating even if you’re not out to party. 

Paris I’m not as ebullient about, but it’s very beautiful and I really like just walking around a ton and enjoying the architecture. Also window shopping on Rue St Honoré. It’s 100% worth going though. 

I’d suggest Amsterdam over Brussels if you want to see that region. I found Brussels kinda bleak and gray.

&gt;Liberal democracy is liberal, while Christian democracy is, by definition, not liberal: it is, if you like, illiberal. And we can specifically say this in connection with a few important issues – say, three great issues. Liberal democracy is in favour of **multiculturalism**, while Christian democracy gives priority to Christian culture; this is an illiberal concept. Liberal democracy is **pro-immigration** while Christian democracy is anti-immigration; this is again a genuinely illiberal concept. And liberal democracy sides with **adaptable family models**, while Christian democracy rests on the foundations of the Christian family model; once more, this is an illiberal concept.

In fact, Orban criticizes ""liberal democracy"" for restricting freedom of speech:
&gt;Working together, political leaders and technology giants filter news items that are uncomfortable for the liberal elite. If you don’t believe this, just visit these websites, visit social media sites, and you’ll see the ingenious and cunning means by which they restrict access to negative news reports on migrants, immigrants and related topics, and how they prevent European citizens from facing reality. The liberal concept of freedom of opinion has gone so far that liberals see diversity of opinion as important up until the point that they realise, to their shock, that there are opinions which are different from theirs.

I know for my part being in Scotland I'd cringe slightly if someone said they were Scottish too. Even though we're both from two of the most similar countries you can get the lifestyle and cultural differences between Scotland and America are so drastic I wouldn't be able to take such a claim seriously.

I think its a shame because I think some groups of Americans sell themselves short by trying to wholly claim being whatever type of European they are when the hybrid cultures they have made in America are fantastic and have many reasons of their own to be celebrated. 

But most importantly I think its the way its expressed that changes the reaction completely.

As crianças são MUITO criativas e, saca, eu aprendi na psicologia que a nossa criança ainda esta dentro de nós. Isso são os arquétipos. Então você precisa curar essa criança interior, dando as coisas que ela gosta, ela vai te dar a arte. Logicamente, essa criança precisa ""morrer"" para você ""renascer"", até porque você não é mais uma criança :P é triste, eu queria voltar a ser criança porque ia ser dahora não pensar em sexo.

Mas hoje vejo que criança pensa pra KRL sobre isso, então foda-se, tanto faz. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Outra coisa ruim que ninguém quer admitir no brasil. Enquanto nossas crianças dançam funk, crianças ricas tão desenhando.

É isso mesmo, se falar que venceu no jogo, mentiu. Até porque tem mais rico branco no Brasil né. E branco ouvindo funk vei, só por moda mesmo, pra beber e ficar pagando de gostoso.

Tanto faz para mim também.

Eu tento falar o que aprendi, que vender sexo, vender mulheres, vender o amor, é o que mais lucra.

Sim, resumi TODA a arte. Sim, arte, infelizmente, é o circo hoje em dia. O pão, mano, ta faltando, mas pelo menos todo mundo tem televisão hoje em dia.

É isso ai. 

Cristianismo, a porra da religião que mais domina, faz uma coisa interessantissima. Na eng. social dzem ""quer colocar algo no subconsciente de alguem? É só falar ""não"" e depois o comando"" É... dai você fala ""Não PENSE EM UM URSO AZUL"" é isso ai, logico, vai ser dificil porque você vai forçar sua imaginação até, hahahaha

Enfim, 10 mandamentos: ""Nao blablabal"" ""Nao seilablabal"" E todo mundo faz né? Sim, ""pecadores"" ou brinquedos controlados?

Jamessuperfun,1387747323.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_eh06a,False,"&gt; Norway is 0.1 aka 5 gun homicides a year over 5 million people. Thats such an infinitesimally small number that your probability of being a homicide by gun victim is basically zero.

But they're *not* zero, there is a consistent figure which allows the places to be compared in relative terms. The probability of being murdered is tiny in basically all of the first world, we are discussing cases per 100,000 population.

&gt; **You have interpreted this to mean that Hawaii is twice or three times as dangerous as Norway.** 

&gt; I have interpreted this to mean that **gun murders are basically nonexistent in both places so they are basically equally as safe.**

This 'interpretation' is objectively false. The best of your examples is triple Norway's and the pattern is consistent. Therefore, the correct statement is that the US is less safe from gun homicides than these places. You are also moving the goalposts; The vast majority of the US has dramatically more per capita gun homicides than Hawaii.

You're using some pretty ridiculous logic here to cover up the fact that not a single US state has such a small amount of gun violence. You've provided 3 examples (unsourced) with 3x, 6x and 8x as much gun murder as the countries you made the statements about. 

&gt; My statement still stands, that the places in the US without any black ghettos are just as safe from gun murders as any other European country. 

It doesn't stand, at all, because there are objectively more of them. Any European country wasn't even your claim, you claimed it specifically about two of the safest countries in the world.

SaliciousSeafoodSlut,1523307296.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1lc0uam,False,"I tend to disagree with the bit where you say it was unwise to kill Joffrey ASAP. There are some reasons that other Redditors have mentioned, but here's my take: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. To wait until after the bedding would mean that Margaery would no longer be a virgin. This would be a huge deal in securing a royal marriage. If we look at the example of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, it required a papal dispensation for them to marry, since she was married to (though allegedly not de-virginized by) Henry's older brother, Arthur. Otherwise it would have been considered incest- and indeed, Henry argued that it was, when he sought to dissolve the marriage. While the ASOIAF doesn't exactly follow the rules of medieval Europe, it's not a stretch to think that something similar could happen. For Margaery to lose her virginity to Joffrey would have jeopardized her betrothal to Tommen, which was the Tyrell's plan all along. Even if the betrothal to Tommen was still considered, there might have been a mandatory waiting period following Joffrey's death (like Jaime imposed on Jeyne Westerling, following Robb's death) to ensure that no children of Margaery's would have doubtful paternity. Which brings me to my second point...
2. Re: Joffrey dying following the wedding, and Margaery becoming pregnant: this supposes that a suitable biological father who could be trusted to stay silent could be found, AND that Margaery would become pregnant very quickly, which doesn't always happen. Even if she did become pregnant in that very narrow window, it's a huge risk for the Tyrells. For instance, what if the child is miscarried, or stillborn? Or what if it's a girl? Or dies young? Then Margaery loses all chance to become queen. Better to kill Joffrey and have Margaery remain a virgin, and then become pregnant by Tommen. (Admittedly, it would be better if Tommen could consummate the marriage immediately.)
3. And my final point, which is less pragmatic, but should be mentioned: Olenna seems to care about her granddaughter. Why subject her to Joffrey for any longer than she has to? She already knows that he's an abusive monster. May as well be rid of him, and set Margaery up with his gentle, malleable brother.

Ceredigion receives in average £57 million a year from the European Union funding commission.
[Source](https://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=111552&amp;headline=%C2%A357m%20a%20year%20benefit%20for%20county%20from%20EU%20membership&amp;sectionIs=News&amp;searchyear=2017)

The funding goes towards two key aspects of the Ceredigion economy - Education and Agriculture.
Agriculture is suffering in Ceredigion due to high costs, low revenues and the fact that most farmers are aging and being bought out.

Universities are running at a serious deficit Aberystwyth (ranked 351 in the top 400 worldwide)  operating with only 46% of its revenue coming from tuition fees (the rest being contracts and funding grants).

Tourism is another vital source of income for the area, and the EU has been involved in numerous restoration and accessibility projects to help preserve Ceredigion's history and heritage.

&gt; Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations).[14][35] Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Kurdish Jews were all very closely related to the populations of the Fertile Crescent, even closer than to Arabs.

&gt; A 2007 study by J. Feder et al.[62] confirmed the hypothesis of the founding of non-European origin among the maternal lines. Their study did not address the geographical origin of Ashkenazim and therefore does not explicitly confirm the origin ""Levantine"" of these founders. This study revealed a significant divergence in total haplogroup distribution between the Ashkenazi Jewish populations and their European host populations, namely Russians, Poles and Germans. They concluded that, regarding mtDNAs, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. The study also found that ""the differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons."" It supported previous interpretations that, in the direct maternal line, there was ""little or no gene flow from the local non-Jewish communities in Poland and Russia to the Jewish communities in these countries.""[63]

- The UK's place in NATO is drawn into question, the USA and France may question whether or not they can trust us and whether we can trust them. If we don't withdraw we'll see diplomatic repercussions, suspension from the G7 prehaps, harming British businesses.

- The UK withdraws from NATO. We can defend our country, but this would be a colossal blow to British soft power and will effectively end our reign as a Great Power. We may find ourselves voted off the UN Security Council, China and Russia don't want us there, what happens if we tell France and the US to fuck off?

- With NATO fragmented, Russia could seize the opportunity then there would be another migration crisis of desperate people fleeing across Europe, most of the EU would be at war with Russia which would disrupt UK-EU trade (which despite what this sub says we'll both rely on post-Brexit).

- Potentially WWIII if China and the USA are dragged into the conflict. The UK would definitely be in a EU-Russia war on the EU's side, as cunty as Brussels are any British government would like to give Putin a bloody nose.

If NATO goes then the post-war order is gone with it, who knows what countries will try to do to increase their influence in a post-Pax Americana world, not a box I want to open. I think it's safer to keep our many alliances, we have a good history of standing up for smaller countries who are threatened by larger ones led by pseudo-dictators, men didn't die in the fields of Belgium and France for the UK to withdraw from the world.

I can’t give you an exact source were source where it says what you ask for. The EU website for regulations and such. Is anything but user friendly, got frustrated very quickly.
What I found on my google search is the following...

Wikipedia and google say: 
Brussels has the “power” to announce non-binding recommendations for member countries. In this case everyone, with varying degree of severance did so. 
I believe that’s what I read in the newspaper back then.

public nudity fines usually are supported by disorderly conduct or obscenity laws and in some cases even labeled as a public order crime. 
Even tho it’s not explicitly stated that being “scandalously” clad is such a offense. which can get you up to a year in jail with no fine option. Though I imagine this to be a rare occasion.

&gt; Prosecutors have called for French far-right leader Marine Le Pen to be tried for tweeting pictures of atrocities committed by the Islamic State group, judicial sources said Friday.

&gt; Le Pen shared the images after a French journalist drew a comparison between the jihadist group and her party.

&gt; Le Pen, whose father Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the National Front party, since renamed National Rally, and other members of her party are also being probed in Brussels over allegations that they defrauded the European Union parliament out of 6.8 million euros in funding between 2009 and 2017.

And of course it comes back to history:

For more than a thousand years, Germans lived in ever increasingly indepedent principalities, dukedoms and (later) kingdoms that were (nominally) subserviant to the Holy Roman Emperor and later the German Confederation. The idea of a unified German nation with an accompanying identity arose comparatively late and lacking such a unified state, it was defined through a *common culture* and the *German language* especially.

That emphasis on culture hasn't really waned that much.

The situation is complicated by the fact, that for the longest time German citizenship exclusively followed the [""ius sanguinis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis), which in theory shouldn't be a problem for those American tourists of German ancestry. But a lot of ""(Spät-)Aussiedler"", citizens of the USSR who moved to Germany after the former's collapse since they were/are of German descent, faced rejection and even discrimination by autochthonous Germans. Thanks to the [repressions by the Soviet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Germans_in_Russia,_Ukraine_and_the_Soviet_Union#Decline_of_the_Russian_Germans) they were heavily assimilated and therefore perceived as Russians. Again, the common culture is the defining factor.

Even today the question of what makes a true German occasionally pops up. Either in relation to our biggest ethnic minority (Turkish immigrants - see [Gastarbeiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter) - and their descendants) or more recently to refugees. Conservative politicians will usually start talking about [""Leitkultur""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitkultur) in that context.

As you can see, a German national identity is a complicated thing and lacks a clear agreed-upon definition.

I understand that saying ""I'm X"" is usually undertstood to mean ""I have X ancestry"" in the US, but the same is just not true for Europe. Here it is understood as being immersed in the culture and being able to speak the language (or at least a bit of it).

Now, the annoyance you mentioned stems from the lack of understanding of traditions/habits/etc. which are seen as integral to the X identity.
An example: A young American woman with German ancestors which emigrated to the States in the 19th century dresses up in a Dirndl (though said ancestors hailed from Lower Saxony) to feel authentically German. She will be laughed at by Germans or even met with scorn, for Dirndls are a type of clothing mostly worn in some parts of Bavaria and even there mostly during a visit to the Oktoberfest.

p.s.: I omitted Nazi Germany and its concepts like the [""Volksdeutsche""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksdeutsche) - you will certainly understand how that time complicates things even further.",True,False,False,,0,1551470715,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehksyb1,False,t3_aw7swu,False,t3_aw7swu,/r/AskEurope/comments/aw7swu/european_travel_manners_talking_about_european/ehksyb1/,False,,1555252043,11,True,False,AskEurope,t5_2uayg,r/AskEurope,public,

No, your own people do that to themselves, and warhawks and israel firsters have made the West a part of your problem and vice versa.

Culture is downstream from race and science proves this.

**Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?**

""A study conducted by Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam suggests that diversity hurts civic life and that differences can actually translate into distrust. The political scientist and author explains his findings on the flip-side of cultural diversity.""

""The more diverse the group around us, ethnically, in our neighborhood, the less we trust anybody, including people who look like us. Whites trust whites less. Blacks trust blacks less, in more diverse settings.""

***

The downside of diversity

""Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam -- famous for ""Bowling Alone,"" his 2000 book on declining civic engagement -- has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.""

""The extent of the effect is shocking,"" says Scott Page, a University of Michigan political scientist.""

While Hitler did not feel powerful enough to arrest senior clergy before the end of the war, an estimated one third of German priests faced some form of reprisal from the Nazi government. Bishop von Preysing was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position, his cathedral administrator and confidant, Provost Bl. Bernard Lichtenberg, was not. A strong opponent of Nazism, Lichtenberg had been active with the Catholic Centre Party.[108] Lichtenberg served at St. Hedwig's Cathedral from 1932, and was under the watch of the Gestapo by 1933, for his courageous support of prisoners and Jews. He became a confidante of Bishop von Preysing from 1935.[108] He ran Preysing's aid unit (the Hilfswerke beim Bischöflichen Ordinariat Berlin) which secretly gave assistance to those who were being persecuted by the regime.[91] From the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938 onward, Lichtenberg closed each nightly service with a prayer for ""the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the concentration camps"", including ""my fellow priests there"".[91][109] Lichtenberg met his demise for protesting the Nazi policy regarding euthanasia directly to Dr. Conti, the Nazi State Medical Director. On 28 August 1941, he endorsed Galen's sermons in a letter to Conti, pointing to the German constitution which defined euthanasia as an act of murder.[110] On 23 October 1942, he offered a prayer for the Jews being deported to the East, telling his congregation to extend to the Jews the commandment of Christ to ""Love thy neighbour"".[109] For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, sentenced to two years' penal servitude, and died en route to Dachau Concentration Camp in 1943.[91] He was subsequently honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous among the Nations.[111]


The Blessed Rupert Mayer SJ was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1939.
The Blessed Rupert Mayer, a Bavarian Jesuit and World War I army chaplain, had clashed with the National Socialists as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler's rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to the Abbey of Ettal, but Myer died in 1945.[112][113]

Laurentius Siemer, Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, became a steadfast opponent of the Nazi regime and had contacts with the Resistance. The Gestapo arrested Siemer in Cologne in 1935, as part of the ""Currency Fraud Cases"" targeting Catholic clergy, and held him in custody for several months. He was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically. He spoke to resistance circles on the subject of Catholic social teaching as the starting point for the reconstruction of Germany, and worked with Carl Goerdeler and others in planning for a post-coup Germany. Following the failure of the July Plot, Siemer evaded capture and hid out until the end of the war.[114]


Fr. Otto Müller of the German Resistance, was arrested following the 1944 July Plot, and died in police custody.
Also involved in the German Resistance was Christian workers' movement activist and Centre Party politician Fr. Otto Müller. Müller was among those who argued for a firm line from the German bishops against legal violations of the Nazis. In contact with the German military opposition before the outbreak of war, he later allowed individual opposition figures the use of the Ketteler-Haus in Cologne for their discussions and was involved with Catholic politicians and July Plotters Jakob Kaiser, Nikolaus Groß and Bernhard Letterhaus in planning a post Nazi-Germany. After the failure of the July Plot, the Gestapo arrested Müller, who was imprisoned in the Berlin Police Hospital, where he died.[115]

Parish priests such as the Lübeck martyrs – Johannes Prassek, Eduard Müller and Hermann Lange, and the Lutheran pastor Karl Friedrich Stellbrink were partly inspired by August von Galen's anti-euthanasia homilies.[116][117][118] They shared disapproval of the Nazi regime, and the four priests spoke publicly against the Nazis – initially discreetly – distributing pamphlets to friends and congregants.[119] Although Church federation work with young people was banned, Müller worked with youth groups and led a discussion circle whose topics included National Socialism, political events and the military situation – using information from British radio and from leaflets including the sermons of Bishop Clemens August von Galen, which he duplicated with Lange and Prassek.[117][120] Then, following a March 1942 RAF raid, after which Stellbrink tended wounded, he delivered a Palm Sunday sermon which attributed the bombing to divine punishment. Stellbrink was arrested, followed by the three Catholic priests, and each was sentenced to death. Resigned to martyrdom, Prassek wrote to his family: ""Who can oppress one who dies"". The mingling of the blood of the four guillotined martyrs has become a symbol of German Ecumenism.[119]

Fr. Max Josef Metzger, a World War I military chaplain and holder of the Iron Cross, had founded the German Catholics' Peace Association in 1919 and sought links to the international pacifist movement. As a leading German pacifist, he was targeted by the Nazi authorities and arrested on several occasions by the Gestapo. He was arrested for the last time in June 1943 after being denounced by a mail courier for attempting to send a memorandum on the reorganisation of the German state and its integration into a future system of world peace to Erling Eidem, the Swedish Archbishop of Uppsala. Sentenced to death, he was executed on 17 April 1944.[121]

An old guard of national-conservatives aligned to Carl Friedrich Goerdeler broke with Hitler in the mid-1930s. According to Kershaw, they ""despised the barbarism of the Nazi regime. But were keen to re-establish Germany's status as a major power ..."". Essentially authoritarian, they favoured monarchy and limited electoral rights ""resting on Christian family values"".[122] ""Hitlerism is poison for the German soul"", wrote Goerdeler, ""Hitler is determined to destroy Christianity"".[123]


Augustin Rösch (centre) was the wartime Jesuit Provincial of Bavaria and one of three Jesuits in the inner Kreisau Circle of the German Resistance.
A younger group, dubbed the ""Kreisau Circle"" by the Gestapo, did not look to German imperialism for inspiration.[122] Religious motivations were particularly strong in the Kreisau Circle of the Resistance.[124] Formed in 1937, though multi-denominational, it had a strongly Christian orientation, and looked for a general Christian revival, and reawakening of awareness of the transcendental. Its outlook was rooted both in German romantic and idealist tradition and in the Catholic doctrine of natural law.[125] The Circle looked to a federalised Europe along the lines of the United States as the desirable ""new order"", resting heavily on German Christian and social ideals, with self-governing communities rooted in social justice. The Circle pressed for a coup against Hitler, but being unarmed was dependent on persuading military figures to take action.[122]

Among the central membership of the Circle were the Jesuit Fathers Augustin Rösch, Alfred Delp and Lothar König.[126] Bishop von Preysing had contact with the group.[127] The Catholic conservative Karl Ludwig von Guttenberg brought the Jesuit Provincial of Southern Germany Augustin Rösch into the Kreisau Circle, along with Alfred Delp. For figures like Rösch, the Catholic trade unionists Jakob Kaiser and Bernhard Letterhaus and the July Plot leader Klaus von Stauffenberg, ""religious motives and the determination to resist would seem to have developed hand in hand"".[55]


The Jesuit Alfred Delp was an influential member of the Kreisau Circle – one of the few clandestine German Resistance groups operating inside Nazi Germany. He was executed in February 1945.[128]
According to Gill, ""Delp's role was to sound out for Moltke the possibilities in the Catholic Community of support for a new, post-war Germany"".[129] Rösch and Delp also explored the possibilities for common ground between Christian and socialist trade unions.[129] Lothar König SJ became an important intermediary between the Circle and bishops Grober of Freiberg and Presying of Berlin.[130]

The Kreisau group combined conservative notions of reform with socialist strains of thought – a symbiosis expressed by Delp's notion of ""personal socialism"".[131] The group rejected Western models, but wanted to ""associate conservative and socialist values, aristocracy and workers, in a new democratic synthesis which would include the churches.""[131] Delp wrote: ""It is time the 20th Century revolution was given a definitive theme, and the opportunity to create new and lasting horizons for humanity"", by which he meant, social security and the basics for individual intellectual and religious development. So long as people lacked dignity, they would be incapable of prayer or thought.[132] In Die dritte Idee (The Third Idea), Delp expounded on the notion of a third way, which, as opposed to Communism and Capitalism, might restore the unity of the person and society.[133]

Another non-military German Resistance group, dubbed the ""Frau Solf Tea Party"" by Gestapo, included the Jesuit Fr Friedrich Erxleben.[134] The purpose of the Solf Circle was to seek out humanitarian ways of countering the Nazi regime. It met at either Frau Solf or Elizabeth von Thadden's home. Von Thadden was a Christian educational reformer and Red Cross worker.[135] Otto Kiep and most of the group were arrested in 1941 and executed.[134][136]

As the recently elected member of Cornwall and Devon, I have the pleasure of answering questions and concerns from the Right Honourable Gentleman, u/throwawayravenclaw.


Mr Deputy Speaker the ideals of Unionism has been core ideal of mine, and my party’s for a long time. It’s quite simple really, our union increases not only the economic prosperity of all of us, but it helps us to defend our nation, to grow our soft power, and put Britain on the world stage.


I raise today to defend our union, a virtue and value my party guarantees. My party and I are proud unionists and I again echo the sentiments around this house that: I believe we can achieve far more together than we ever could apart.


I will echo the voice of my friends, and other honourable members of this house: All four constituent nations of our kingdom, England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, are beneficiaries from the participation in our kingdom.

I have purposefully excluded Cornwall, and for a reason.


While my party will always respect the regional differences, language, and traditions. We will continue to respect the Cornish people and their culture.


But on the issue of Cornish Nationalism. I hold a strong stance. Cornwall is not a country.


The Stannary laws that governs Cornwall is governs tin mining in Devon and Cornwall which no longer of much practical relevance. The Convocation which the Rt Hon. Gentlemen brought up sat for the last time in 1748.

signatures to raise the issue of the ""Cornish Identity"" in Parliament""This petition has now closed, it received 851 signatures, (99,149 less than the 100,000 needed for the matter to be considered for debate in the House of Commons.)


The Right Honourable Gentle claims to want Cornish Devolution. Is he aware that the Cornish Council, established in 2009,has given a choice and voice to those within Cornwall? Is he aware that Mebyon Kernow, the only nationalist Cornish party within the Council, has only 4 seats within? In comparison to the 119 Pro-Unionist councillors, can we not say that the issue of Nationalism is a small issue to the
cornish people? If the issue is of such wide support as the Right Honourable gentleman claims, shouldn’t that view be reflected within the council of Cornish people? In the 2009 European election, the Pro-Nationalist party of Mebyon Kernow, only received 14,922 votes?
This just goes to further prove that the problem is not popular amongst the Cornish people, who as a part of the southwest, sent 6 pro-unionist MEPs to the EU.


Mr.Deputy Speaker It is clear to me and others in this house, that the matter of Cornish Nationalism is not a popular issue amongst the Cornish as the right honourable gentleman claims it to me. Therefore I

&gt; # [Las jugadas de Maduro con Rusia para la supervivencia del régimen](https://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/venezuela/image/jpeg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;   Maduro ordenó pasar la oficina central de PDVSA a Moscú y recibirá ayuda humanitaria rusa.
&gt; 
&gt;   Delcy Rodríguez, vicepresidenta de Venezuela, durante su encuentro con el canciller ruso, Sergio Lavrov.
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;  01 de marzo 2019 , 12:42 p.m.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Tras la asfixia diplomática en la cual se encuentra el régimen de Venezuela por la aplicación de múltiples sanciones estadounidenses, y los diferentes mecanismos de presión del Grupo de Lima y de la Unión Europea, **su vicepresidenta, Delcy Rodriguez, viajó a Moscú para socavar apoyos que le permitan la supervivencia en el poder.**
&gt; 
&gt; Junto a uno de sus más grandes aliados, como lo es Rusia, Venezuela aceptó la ayuda humanitaria que el gobierno de Putin enviará a Caracas. También anunció el traslado de la oficina de la petrolera estatal Pdvsa de Lisboa a Moscú, con el fin de garantizar la seguridad de los activos del país.
&gt; 
&gt; En materia humanitaria, Rodríguez insiste en negar que Venezuela sufra una crisis y aseguró que países como Colombia o Paraguay son mucho más pobres, aunque informó que Caracas está ""en proceso de trabajo"" **con las agencias de cooperación de la ONU para ""recibir asistencia técnico-humanitaria"" de países como ""la hermana**   
&gt; **Rusia"", pero ""nunca"" de aquellos que ""realizaron acciones unilaterales, arbitrarias e ilegales contra Venezuela"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Lavrov aseguró que Rusia envió ""un primer lote de 7,5 toneladas de medicamentos"" con destino a Venezuela. ""Hemos recibido una lista suplementaria de medicamentos que el gobierno venezolano desearía obtener. **Estamos examinándola, aclarando los detalles y verificando los detalles logísticos"", agregó el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores.**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Estas son las imágenes que ⁦[@jorgeramosnews](https://twitter.com/jorgeramosnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)⁩ le mostró a Nicolás Maduro y que provocaron que Maduro se levantara de la entrevista,⁩ que retuvieran al equipo de Univision y que confiscaran su trabajo. Esto es lo que Maduro no quiere que vea el mundo. [https://twitter.com/Enrique\_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472/video/1](https://twitter.com/Enrique_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472/video/1)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; — Enrique Acevedo (@Enrique\_Acevedo) [26 de febrero de 2019](https://twitter.com/Enrique_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Rodríguez destacó que Maduro ha dado ""instrucciones muy claras"" para que los alimentos y medicamentos que el país necesita ""sean adquiridos"" en   
&gt; Rusia, a lo que hay que sumar la producción ""conjunta"" de productos básicos en territorio venezolano. **También recordó que Venezuela ha informado al Grupo de Contacto de la Unión Europea de que está dispuesta a pagar alimentos y medicinas por valor de ""casi dos mil millones de dólares"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Sobre la posible intervención militar de EE. UU.
&gt; 
&gt; **""Europa no da garantías de respeto a nuestros activos"", dijo Rodríguez durante una rueda de prensa conjunta con su homólogo ruso, Serguéi Lavrov, en Moscú.** La vicepresidenta aseguró que los países capitalistas están violando sus propias leyes al congelar los bienes de Venezuela en bancos occidentales y tachó de un ""robo a mano armada"" lo que se está haciendo en la actualidad con los recursos financieros de Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; Al respecto, acusó a los ""intolerantes"" países occidentales de violar sus propias leyes ""capitalistas"" y consideró que el ""momento era oportuno"" para dicha decisión, dada la creciente cooperación con los mayores consorcios rusos: la petrolera Rosneft y la gasística Gazprom.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  Tomas aéreas difundidas en redes sociales muestran al segundo vehículo de la caravana en medio de las llamas, justo antes de llegar al bloqueo de las fuerzas del régimen de Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; **De esta manera, Rodríguez busca recabar el apoyo político, comercial y humanitario de Rusia para garantizar la supervivencia del régimen del presidente Nicolás Maduro, al tiempo que descartó la posibilidad de que prospere una intervención militar estadounidense.** ""Venezuela no necesita una intervención militar. Nuestro continente no necesita una intervención militar, ni de Estados Unidos ni de nadie. Necesitamos paz, estabilidad y tranquilidad"", aseguró.
&gt; 
&gt; De esta manera, la vicepresidenta desveló que había intercambiado con Lavrov ""información relevante"" sobre una posible intervención estadounidense y aseguró que dichos planes ""no son nuevos"" y recuerdan a Siria, donde el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, evitó el derrocamiento del presidente Bachar al Asad por parte de Washington.
&gt; 
&gt; **""Sabemos que hay toda una maniobra que pretende justificar la intervención internacional. Eso no ocurrirá en Venezuela""**, afirmó y acusó al enviado especial de EE. UU. para Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, de tener experiencia en ""actividades subversivas"" y de buscar desestabilizar el país con la creación de ""grupos irregulares"".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; También se discutió el futuro de Guaidó
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  El presidente de Brasil Jair Bolsonao (i) saluda al jefe de la Asamblea Nacional, Juan Gauidó, durante un pronunciamiento conjunto tras una reunión privada en Brasilia.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto al retorno de Guaidó a Venezuela, que podría producirse el lunes 4 de marzo (si no acepta la invitación que el hizo el presidente de Ecuador, Lenín Moreno, para visitarlo en Quito), Rodríguez aseguró que se trata de ""un señor que de repente un día se fue a una plaza pública y se autoproclamó presidente por el simple hecho de contar con el apoyo del Gobierno de EE. UU."", lo que calificó de ""atentado"" contra el orden constitucional.
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Pero, peor aún, es un señor que colabora con gobiernos extranjeros para atentar contra el estado de derecho. Y en Venezuela existe un estado de derecho consolidado y vigoroso como su democracia que cuenta con los mecanismos de defensa de su propia constitucionalidad"", señaló.
&gt; 
&gt; **Consideró que Venezuela tiene una oposición ""incompetente de ganarse el amor de los venezolanos a través de los votos y busca desesperadamente, pide a gritos una intervención militar como única forma de llegar al poder"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Y recordó que Maduro apoya el diálogo con la oposición en el marco de los mecanismos de Montevideo, motivo por el que Lavrov destacó la postura ""constructiva"" del líder venezolano, frente a la ""destructiva"" de Guaidó.

Kh_0502,1499072824.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_5vx9yff,False,"I took a two week break as well. I got back with a better mindset and improved way more than before since I started to become bored. To improve again you can make a schedule. I dont know how much time you have on weekdays or weekends or how competitive you are but this worked for me.

Firstly check if you’re keybinds are still good and if your comfortable with your set up (enough space for mouse etc) try to find someone who can teach you some new tricks and inform you about the meta.  (if you are on europe send a pm, I might help you a bit) 

30 min kovaaks (do more tracking than flicks, since you use tracking 90% of the time, I recommend doing ascended tracking v2 for 15 min, tile frenzy 180 for 7.5 min and something of your liking. Make sure you use your exact fortnite sensitivity ( [good introduction video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0X--vk5N_0Y) )

15 min edit courses (difficult as possible try to implement edits you couldnt do before, dont get in the comfort zone. If you can do floor pyramid edit on each ramp running, you turn it into edit pyramid as a ramp and then floor pyramid edit for example.) I would recommend making your own edit course with edits that you want to work on.  In my edit course I have a few “awkward” edits. I don’t have a video, but it is basically a wall-&gt;boostpad-&gt;wall, so that you get boosted into the wall.

15 min building (dont do only 90’s, mix everything you do ingame; turtling variations, side jumps etc.) 

If you have enough time you can do some 1v1s or turtle fights, especially turtle fights, they helped me a lot. Look for a creative server that organises this multiple times a day. If you are doing 1v1s dont do it always with the same person, since you will get used to their playstyle. You can find an opponent in a few min at discord servers or lfg like on fortnitetracker. You can do this as long as you like. For good inspiration and tricks look at some videos of [Riley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VgU5JvkKJjy4neRuHQdtQ) watch his buildfight compilations in slomo. 

If you want to play pubs, then you are probably more than ready now, but you could always do a game of team rumble and try to get a 30 bomb for aim practice. If your goal is scrimming, do 30 min of hotdropping in pubs to finish the warm up. 

After your games take 10 minutes each day to re-watch a scrim match where you got into late-game but didnt win and what you could improve. Look at rotations, how you died, where you took unnecessary damage, if you didn’t have enough mats etc.

Mentality is also really important, never try to blame the game. There is almost always a way that you could’ve avoided that mistake. If you blame the game, you miss out on a opportunity to learn from your mistake. 

After each pub/scrim write down how you died/what your mistake was. If you can find what the problem is (missing shots, stress, cannot get the highground, messing up an edit, not utilising right hand peek etc.) then you can focus on that more on your next day.

CJohn89,1527115715.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_900xn0n,False,"&gt;Lol your pro american bias clouds your judgement. Again

But I have no pro America bias. It is one of my favorite topics to lampoon. It only appears favourable in comparsion to the evil slave caliphate built by the South which the US went a long way in redemption by dedeating.

Your pro slavery caliphate bias is the issue here.

I have presented evidence and you have not.

&gt; you arent considering the personal motivations of the southerners who were fighting for their country

Southerners were fighting against their Country. Their country was the USA and they explicitly collectively declared they'd rather be a slave Nation than loyal to an egalitarian Nation.

The only exception of all the diary entries I have read is this one from a confederate Soldier

&gt;""...the North is relentless and savage in their aggression. We have requested time to bury the dead which pile high. My brother, O dear brother was given to God Monday and his body still lays were it fell. I wish for peace, I wish and pray for our dignity  as Sons of Adam to return. I would never allow the poor treatment of another Negro if it means Lincoln calls his dogs off my land and allows me to earn my living as a free man.
   --Hamish Lancaster, 1862 ""Journal of a Southern Freeman"" (Published 1953)

Even though one example against doesn't doesn't coint for much to an intelligent person. There's an even more obvious reason why that doesn't count.

&gt;I suggest you consider this qoute from Lincoln

Three times I have responded to that quote in detail. Of the seven times you have quoted it nothing in ut has changed.

Maybe next time you can use the full quote though



&gt;this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. *I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong, having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary*, **but I hold that notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.** I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. **I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects---certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man. **

This is your *only* example of anything (which does nothing to support your actual point that the South seceded for than slavery) and the full context and content contradicts you.

It contradicts you so much that you end thebquote mid sentence.

See how badly you fail?

Everything you said has been wrong

-I have no Nationalist sentiment or Pro-Armerica bias. I am not even a US citizen

-Europe didn't replace slavery with serfdom. Serfdom is medieval and slavery was *the last practised form of serfdom in Europe*, moron.

-There are no surveys or correspondence, not one, that has has confederates giving their reasons for fighting or secession anything other than slavery and their determination for their slave caliphate to exist kept them fighting.

You know this and cant contradict it.

-Lincoln was a staunch abolitionist and believed in the equality of black people in all Natural rights. This was not racist enough for the South and so he made a statement during a debatr, part if this was his expressing a racist view that he did not extent this view to social and political equality.

You're quoting Lincoln qualifying his egalitarian views with an appeal to the racist scumbag confederate audience present and it ultimately failed.",True,False,False,,0,1551473638,,1551475160,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehkx9fo,True,t3_au2pb1,True,t1_ehkp1ny,/r/HistoryMemes/comments/au2pb1/one_more/ehkx9fo/,False,,1555254070,1,True,False,HistoryMemes,t5_2v2cd,r/HistoryMemes,public,

1. It doesn't list any type of timeframe for the white slaves, their conditions, or the length of their slavery. Slavery is often only discussed in the American context, but it doesn't behave the same everywhere. For example, Salves in the Ottoman empire could become government officials, obtain prestigious positions, or gain freedom in ways that was never really possible for in American slavery. And, this is speculation, but the fact that they could become officials implies that they also might have had better access to things like education. 

2. Black slaves went to the Caribbeans, Central America, and South America in greater numbers than they came to the US or 13 colonies. Saying there were more whites than blacks in the slave trade is *way* different than saying more whites were brought to North Africa than to the 13 colonies because those brought to the 13 colonies are a small fraction of the total amount in the slave trade. Slaves were brought to Europe, all of North America (not just 13 colonies), the Caribbean, and in greatest numbers to South America. So it sounds like he's comparing a fraction of one slave trade to the whole of another. If so, for what reason? 

I'm not the guy you've been talking about this with, but I don't think this quote is used in good faith, if its even accurate at all.

The US used NY and Swift since Bill Clinton as a weapon in faster succession. Since this is a sword of Damocles over China and Russia it is just a logical step to develop an alternative.  The expression America First has become  now a threat especially since informal and formal agreements with the US are worthless. The world of finance has become a stage for war. But as in every modern war weapons are becoming faster outdated than anticipated and the risk to become a victim is too high. China is able to build and maintain  the infrastructure for Brics.  China is for Asia the key for international trade which will pump money into this system. The EU is thinking about a similar policy but not that noisy. 

I'm considering the usage of tariffs and denying to be able to pay as a huge strategic mistake. First it hit only smaller countries like Serbia to be extended later to Africa only to hit Russia later. The paranoid perception of China as a hostile power accelerated the thinking about alternatives and controlling the payment channels gives access to cheap money.  When the EU became a target because of JPCOA from president and congress it was IMHO not to avoid to perceive the actions as a huge warning light.

Even our basketball, soccer and rugby league domestic leagues have a team from NZ competing in them.

American basketball (and to some extent football) as well as European (mainly English) soccer is pretty big here.

&gt; &amp;quot;We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU,&amp;quot; Michel Barnier said in an interview with Germany&amp;#039;s Die Welt newspaper to be published on Saturday.

&gt; Barnier said EU guarantees that the backstop is temporary could come as part of the political agreement setting out expectations for Britain&amp;#039;s relationship with the bloc after it leaves.

kyrvyl,1538898323.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2d47i5t8,False,"&gt;Me: Fleeing a terrible situation

&gt;You: organized plan to take over Europe

For one, why can't it be both? I mean ISIS and others have said that is what they are trying to do.

Do you seriously think it can only be one or the other? That people in power wouldn't see fit to capitalize on a situation?

This is the exact thing with immigration in America. Yes, people are looking for a better life. But the situation sure as hell would be different if they voted Republican. Sort of like how neither the US or Europe has any interest in bringing in Boer refugees, yet we're perfectly happy bringing in Guatemalans for some reason despite being in a less dangerous situation. If it was truly only about helping people, it simply doesn't add up. 

The problem with the ""fleeing a terrible situation"" thing is severalfold. 

For one, like I said, it's much cheaper to relocate people to safe zones in the middle east. It's over 10 times cheaper. If you want to help the most people, that's obviously the best way to do it. Bringing them across the ocean makes no sense. 

Two, the majority of ""refugees"" are military age males. It's so dangerous they have to leave their women and children behind? And very many of them are not from active warzones, perhaps the majority, merely from shitty countries looking to make money.

So why do they have to come to Europe? And in Europe, why Norway and Germany? Places like Italy and Greece are much cheaper. Yet they all try to get through those to the countries with the highest welfare.

And this ignores the entire immigration component - refugees are only one component of the mass importation of Muslims. Many are simply normal immigrants.

So all this adds up to not make much sense. Yes, there are some people fleeing bad situations. There are also very many people capitalizing on the opportunity to present themselves that way. And all in all, it makes no sense why they all have to go to Europe.

Rape Jihad is the millions of native women these migrants have sexually assaulted.

In short, it makes no sense to bring millions of these people to Europe, the supposed justifications are rather flimsy, and the consequences have been severe. If the intention were not to oppress and destroy the local populations, that sure seems like the intended effect. While meanwhile lots of the same people advocating for helping these poor refugees are at the same time demanding more military intervention in the middle east...

I don't like it for all the reasons you stated.

Suddenly, all my YouTube activity going back to the early 2000's had my full name plastered on it!!! And I couldn't take it off! I was very careful with Facebook comments, because I was conscious from the beginning that my name was attached, but I couldn't say the same about YouTube from 2005!!!! Fuck!!!!

I tried everything to untangle those accounts or take my name off. I couldn't.  I wrote a  nasty, angry email to Google and deleted my YouTube account. 

At some point I got it back and it doesn't have my name on it.

I actually don't think I wrote anything THAT BAD on there, but it was when I was becoming conscious of ""E footprint"" and it was making me infuriated and upset that Google want allowing me to control that. It felt like an absolute invasion, and violation, back stamping my internet activity with my full name and not allowing me to control it. 

Especially with my name!!!! It's only me. It's no one else. And it feels very violating for just anyone to be able to Google me and trawl through years of my online activity...

It's been several years since I even use my real name on Facebook even.

ninja1635,1398368472.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_gacnp,False,"""The people"". I don't have good memories of ~~Venice~~ FLORENCE. The city was beautiful and was neat to see it outside of a game... BUT there were waaaay too many people when I was there (random ordinary day, no celebrations).

It was almost impossible to walk around the city without bumping into someone every few seconds. Crowded like an ant nest. Very unpleasant tourist experience. Was difficult to find anywhere to sit down and nearly all restaurants were full.

Was able to get a table at a nice restaurant with my ex. The menu was in Italian language with very bad and vague English translations. I ordered a beef dish which was 15€, but after I ate it and got a receipt, I noticed they charged me 25€ for it. I then went to check the menu and noticed that they didn't bring me the right dish, but a dish that was right above the one I ordered (also a beef dish, so it was practically impossible to notice the dish wasn't correct). Couldn't do anything about it because I already finished the meal and they spoke English worse than elementary school children in my country. Although the food was good, I couldn't help but to feel cheated. Either it was an honest mistake or intentional to dry my wallet (leaning more towards that).

And back to the topic of poor English... People in Italy are like from a different planet in which no other language exists. Extremely self centered nation. Was difficult to communicate with any public workers and information desks (like wtf, why are people who don't know English on information desks?!). 

Also had problems with my Airbnb hosts because of that. Our flight (to Rome) was delayed for 2 hours, I called the host when we arrived and he was completely pissed and didn't understand more than half of the things I said. He literally left us roofless at sometime after 19:00 during a weekend. Luckily I got into contact with Airbnb support and they got us a place but I was still extremely pissed at that host, you can't just dump someone in the middle of a foreign city because their flight was delayed for 2 hours - and then yell at them ""IT YOR PROBLM, NO MINE"" when asked where will we sleep.

Then I had another problem with a host in Florence (but not as negative as the above), who almost completely couldn't speak English. The listed address wasn't correct and it was a huge hassle to find the apartment.

Anyways, those were just my experiences, I'm sure many people don't find themselves in such situations. Although I just mentioned some bad stuff there was also a lot of good stuff, but I still feel like Italy was the least tourist friendly country I visited in Europe. I don't get it when people keep complimenting Italy as being super hospitable. Even Serbia was much friendlier, hospitable and English capable + hella cheaper.

Bawstahn123,1452655255.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_tqp33,False,"In Britannia, most people live in the countryside, where they work the land for themselves and their noble landlords. These tenant farmers are known as ""coloni"", and while they are free, they do owe their landlord a debt ala sharecropping for the use of their fields, plows, ox-teams, etc.

There is a particular subclass of these colonates called ""adscripticii"", who are bound to their landlords estates due to outstanding debts, prohibited from leaving the boundaries of their landlords latifundum without permission under a system of fines, imprisonment or physical beatings. 

While the above doesnt sound pleasant, it must be noted that one does not come to be a colonus adscriptus without first signing a contract, so you cant (technically) be made an adscripticii against your will. And in return for your labor and portion of the crops, the adscripticii is no longer required to pay taxes as a freeman would, the landlord is legally obligated to feed and provide tools to the tenant while they labored, and the debt of the tenant would be wiped away.

So, while giving up your freedom and that of your family might be not an optimal outcome, it is actually relatively common, and many peasant families enter the contract willingly in order to wipe away debt, which as the climate across Europe is deteriorating and farmers are seeing declining or even failing crop yields, might be the best of a slew of poor choices.

So, a colonus adcripticii is not allowed to leave their landlords estate without permission, which is usually only granted for market-days held once a week in most civitates. Free coloni, on the other hand, can do what they want and go where they want.

  *Boa leitura!* 

  O ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [obteve autorização da Justiça](justica-autoriza-lula-deixar-pf-para-acompanhar-velorio-de-neto-em-sp-23492526) para deixar a carceragem da Polícia Federal, em Curitiba, e ir ao velório do neto Arthur Araújo Lula da Silva, de 7 anos, em São Bernardo do Campo (SP). O menino morreu [vítima de meningite meningocócica](https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/ancelmo/post/neto-do-ex-presidente-lula-morre-de-meningite-meningococica-em-sao-paulo.html) , horas depois de dar entrada no hospital com febre alta, informa Ancelmo Gois. 

  **Detalhes:** Lula [recebeu a notícia](chefe-da-custodia-da-pf-leva-lula-noticia-sobre-morte-de-seu-neto-23491954) do chefe da custódia da PF na capital paranaense, Jorge Chastallo Filho. Arthur era o quinto dos seis netos do petista. O corpo do menino será cremado às 12h de sábado. 

  Contexto: no fim de janeiro, a Justiça Federal proibiu a ida de Lula ao velório do irmão Genival Inácio da Silva, o Vavá. A defesa recorreu ao Supremo Tribunal Federal, mas a autorização foi concedida minutos antes do enterro, e o ex-presidente permaneceu em Curitiba. 

  Agora, a PF e a força-tarefa da Lava-Jato [concordaram com a saída temporária](justica-autoriza-lula-deixar-pf-para-acompanhar-velorio-de-neto-em-sp-23492526) . O governo do Paraná disponibilizou um avião para transportá-lo. 

  Autoridades se mobilizaram para evitar a interdição do Sambódromo do Rio. Após vistoriar o local, o Corpo de Bombeiros [emitiu laudo informando que não se opõe à realização dos desfiles](/rio/bombeiros-nao-se-opoem-aos-desfiles-na-sapucai-judiciario-decidira-sobre-liberacao-1-23491106) de escolas de samba, mas indicou pendências de documentação. Horas depois, a Riotur afirmou ter cumprido as [18 exigências emergenciais](/rio/riotur-afirma-ter-cumprido-18-exigencias-do-corpo-de-bombeiros-no-sambodromo-23492884) e decidiu, junto com a Liesa, a liga das agremiações, [assinar o termo de responsabilidade exigido pela Justiça para liberar o evento](/rio/sambodromo-riotur-liesa-irao-assinar-corresponsabilidade-documentos-ainda-precisam-ser-entregues-justica-23492503) . 

  **Últimos acontecimentos:** três horas antes do início dos desfiles, previstos para às 22h30m, a Justiça ainda não havia liberado o Sambódromo. Mesmo assim, [os portões estavam aberto, e o público já ocupava a arquibancada](/rio/ainda-sem-autorizacao-da-justica-sambodromo-abre-ao-publico-para-primeiro-dia-de-desfiles-23493404) .

  **Outro caso: ** também em cima da hora, o bloco Carmelitas conseguiu autorização para desfilar e levou dezenas de foliões às ruas de Santa Teresa. [Músicas e fantasias expressaram críticas](/rio/carmelitas-desfila-em-santa-teresa-com-criticas-vale-mais-laranjas-lembranca-jean-wyllys-23492224) ao governo, à mineradora Vale e ao caso Fabrício Queiroz.

  **Restrições ao ministro:** ao intervir para derrubar a indicação da cientista política Ilona Szabó para conselho sobre política criminal, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro [quebrou uma promessa feita a Sergio Moro.](bolsonaro-quebra-promessa-feita-moro-de-dar-liberdade-total-para-nomeacoes-na-justica-23490829) 

  **A versão de Queiroz:** Fabrício Queiroz disse ao Ministério Público, em depoimento por escrito, que [“gerenciava” valores recebidos por servidores do gabinete](queiroz-diz-ao-mp-que-usava-salarios-para-multiplicar-base-eleitoral-de-flavio-bolsonaro-23490787) de Flávio Bolsonaro para expandir a rede de colaboradores do parlamentar, sem informá-lo. A Alerj disse que a prática não é permitida. 

  **Cor, olhos e cabelo:** uma decisão judicial de 2016 está provocando polêmica nas redes sociais. Na sentença, a juíza Lissandra Reis Ceccon, da 5ª Vara Criminal de Campinas, [descreve características do homem](/sociedade/reu-nao-possui-estereotipo-padrao-de-bandido-diz-juiza-em-condenacao-por-latrocinio-23492053) que acabou condenado por latrocínio: “não possui estereótipo de bandido”. 

  **Acusação de estupro:** uma turista baiana de 24 anos disse que foi [assediada e estuprada por cinco bombeiros](/rio/mulher-muda-versao-em-depoimento-nega-estupro-por-bombeiros-diz-delegada-23492970) no Posto 2 da orla, em Copacabana, na manhã desta sexta-feira.

Considerou que filhos de militares foram privilegiados porque tiveram acesso anterior a 21 das 50 questões. 

  **Festa na Câmara: ** às vésperas do carnaval, vereadores de Niterói aprovaram, por unanimidade, [aumento de 50% em seus próprios salários](/rio/bairros/vereadores-de-niteroi-aprovam-aumento-de-50-em-seus-proprios-salarios-23491927) . 

  **Repasse a petista:** a delação de ex-executivos da OAS inclui relato sobre pagamento de cerca de [R$ 1 milhão ao ex-ministro José Dirceu](delatores-da-oas-relatam-repasses-de-1-milhao-jose-dirceu-23491951) . 

  **Perdas recentes: ** o empresário Jorge Paulo Lemann deixou o posto de homem mais rico do Brasil depois que perdeu US$ 4,4 bilhões — agora, sua fortuna é de US$ 23 bilhões. [Confira o ranking atualizado](/economia/jorge-paulo-lemann-perde-posto-de-homem-mais-rico-do-brasil-23491396) . 

  **Do lado de cá...:** após receber Juan Guaidó em Brasília, o chanceler Ernesto Araújo articula no Grupo de Lima iniciativa para [convencer China e Rússia](/mundo/brasil-esta-disposto-ajudar-china-russia-entenderem-situacao-da-venezuela-diz-chanceler-23491792) de que o governo de Nicolás Maduro na Venezuela é “ilegítimo”. 

  **...e do lado de lá:** Maduro reforça laços com os russos. Ele ordenou a [transferência do escritório europeu da PDVSA](/mundo/maduro-ordena-transferencia-de-escritorio-europeu-da-pdvsa-para-moscou-23490762) , a petroleira venezuelana, para Moscou.

No it doesn’t. It means they have somewhere to live without the threat of being thrown to the street it doesn’t have to be a mansion it has to be secure housing. 

&gt; A new car? and old car? any car that moves without a tow truck? A Mercedes? a Toyota? literally the cheapest one on craigslist?

Anything that could provide the means to maintain their employment? Would you allow that or not bootstraps enough for you? A car? Possibly. But public transport is probably more important. Secure that. Make it cheaper and convenient. You knows amazing about good public transport. It pays for itself! 

&gt; Any entertainment? A tv? Cable, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Youtube premium, spotify, pandora and siriusXM subscriptions? Or just a radio?

Entertainment is the classic go to. Yeah it may not be a necessity but we’ll how long you can go without being depressed or beaten when you lose your entertainment. Because these people don’t actually have be free time to socialise generally. Because they’re working two jobs. 

&gt; Eating out twice a week? once a month? never?

Eating out? Maybe not. But eating. I can’t believe this is even in the cards as a nonessential. Also you can live without eating out. That’s not in contention. You’re making an issue out of nothing here. 

&gt; Any vacations? one a year? three a year? to Europe or a state park?
 
Going abroad isn’t possible clearly but vacation time should be guaranteed even if it’s staying home for a week not driving their car they’re not allowed to own or watching the Netflix they shouldn’t have or going out for a meal they can’t have...

Quality of life cannot be quantified you’re right. But human decency can be respected and professional dignity should be a right. Quality of life is the basic needs of all people and something the “RICHEST NATION ON EARTH” should be able to grant without a problem. Your own nation has in its mantra “in the pursuit if happiness” you’re not willing to grant that.

This means May's deal would need approximately **80** Labour defectors to pass.  It will never achieve nearly that number.  Any Labour member voting for May's deal will be run a strong risk of deselection.  And because those Labour MPs wouldn't have the votes to actually put May's deal over the top, they would be committing political suicide to no end.

It's time to face the hard truth.  The numbers do not add up for May's deal.  Never have.  Never will.

&gt; There aren't that many Tories who'll vote for a second referendum. 

Of course there are.  May's majority now stands at what?  4 MPs? 5?  This after the recent defections, but including the DUP.  

Many reports this week, (including from some of the nation's most conservative newspapers) say that somewhere in the range of 20 Tory MPs have now threatened to quit the party unless No Deal is ruled out.  Even even only 1/5th of those actually carried out the threat, the government would collapse.

The most likely path from here is a delay, followed by a referendum, a general election, or revocation.  This largely dependent on whether the EU allows a delay.  And at this point, a delay may only be permitted if May gives the EU a viable rationale for that delay.  Many in the EU do not consider a deadlocked Parliament  a rational justification.  They claim it will take a referendum or a GE.

So of all the various end points, Revocation is IMHO, the one with the best odds today.  But May could change this at a whim were she to support a GE or Referendum.

Why do you believe this? There is a very strong consensus that glyphosate is safe for consumers. Even the strongest reasonable nay-sayers argue that doses which *applicators* are exposed to cause minor increases in the risk of getting a certain kind of cancer.

It really seems like you read a bunch of organic industry propaganda and didn't think critically about it. There is huge financial incentive to demonize glyphosate.

Glyphosate allows farmers to adopt no-till methods, so it massively reduces carbon emissions associated with tillage. By increasing yield per acre, it also helps reduce habitat destruction. It breaks down quickly, doesn't readily leach into watersheds, and has minimal off-target toxicity. Farmers aren't stupid, they switched away from atrazine/cyanazine/eptc/alachlor --- have you even *heard of those herbicides?*

**World Health Organization**: [""In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.""](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)

However, Paris has been sacked by basically every invading force (And could argue by themselves in the French Revolution) I'm not really aware of any time Paris wasn't immediately surrendered upon being sacked at that. Russia did it (You brought up Napoleon, but the Battle of Paris took all of 30 hours to win the city... this is what led to Napoleon's exile), the Danish ransacked the city (Until the King of France had to literally pay them to leave), Germany of course, Prussia did it also in the late 1800s.

So Paris has surrendered. A lot.

That being said, the French army and history is as expansive as you say. There is no United States without France. France didn't follow suit with other European countries and attempt to help out the Confederacy, I mean, look up the Battle of Verdun. They turned away a MILLION German soliders with their numbers below 200k. 

There also isn't a D-Day without the French resistance isolating Normandy and without the Yanks, well, wir sprechen alle Deutsch. 

France hasn't kept a continuous empire for 400 years, much less 800 The French Empire is younger than the United States. So I'm not sure what you are referring to. (Remember they had a Monarchy and were a Republic after that Monarchy was overthrown)

I think, ironically enough, that that 800 year figure is actually referring to Britain. Famously no one has invaded the main island in almost a literal millennium (1066). Before WW1, literally 25% of the WORLD'S population was under British rule. 

Sorry this is super long winded and to meme on Paris in such a way is a playful jab, but one that isn't based on meme and meme alone.

It's a fine office but nothing compared to my wonderful old dentist who isn't covered by my insurance anymore :( It's a different hygienist at this new dentist's office every time. I go in to get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist is a, like, late 40's early 50's Eastern European woman. She asks if I've ever had braces. I say no. She tells me that I should get braces. I say no thanks. She asks if I am married or have kids. I say no.

She then tells me that I'd have a much easier time getting a husband if I got braces.

I WAS LIVID, and this woman's fingers were in my mouth so all I could do was fume instead of raging at her. Like. #1 that is such a stupid way to sell orthodontics #2 she is a hygienist, not even the dentist, why is she recommending braces for me??? #3 I am pretty gay, I do not want a husband!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Blood Command is a post-hardcore/punk band from Bergen in Norway . The band was started in 2008 by Yngve Andersen (guitar, bass guitar and keyboard) from Jeroan Drive. He brought Silje Tombre on vocals and Sigurd Haakaas on drums. The band was one of the nominees for the Årets Urørt in 2010 and was nominated for the Spellemannprisen for best rock album (Ghostlocks) in 2011. The album also reached across borders; The single Cult of the New Beat was in rotation at BBC and the music magazine Rock Sound praised the band as ""Band of the Week"".

&gt; In August 2011 Blood Command was support for the Canadian hardcore band Comeback Kid in Europe.
In 2015, vocalist Silje Tombre was replaced with Karina Ljone.

&gt; After some absence, Blood Command came back in 2017 with their album Cult Drugs which released on April 29, 2017.

Because after WW2 America came and occupied them and never left and told them they're going to be democratic or else they'll be attacked.

I have a creeping suspicion you're a kid. 

The British Empire came BEFORE the USA and the British Empire was NOT democratic.

So other nations adopt democracy not because 'its the best system' but because they're forced to by an imperialist power?

Because a man is stronger in association with others. Because men want a woman (as part of biology), because they want kids. Because men and women are not biologically equal.

Also, Algiers was a military victory for the French. Their tactics in urban warfare is studied to this day. The political aspect of the war was lost. Just like America in Vietnam. 

America saved no one in WWI. Germany was starving by 1918 and Ludendorff's last offensive was futile. He also wanted to focus on the British because he was terrified of French artillery which by 1918 was vastly superior to the Germans. The French Army in 1918 was one of the most modern and mobile in the world. Also, the Allies were lead by a Frenchmen, Ferdinand Foch and it was the Second Battle of the Marne that ended the German offensive. Most of the divisions that fought were French. 44 in fact, out of 58. World War I was not a tie, it was a victory shared by the French and British (Haig, Amiens) while the Americans helped. 

""Italian Wars"" which ones? If it weren't for France, modern Italy wouldn't have existed.

Franco-Prussian War: Sure, France's worse defeat. They bet too much on the most advanced rifle of the time, the Chasspot, but the Germans had the breach loading Krupp guns. Thanks to the French rifle, the Germans suffered horrific losses. The war was a major setback, but France outmaneuvered Germany in overseas colonies, especially in Africa effectively making them the second most powerful European power on the continent. 

World War II: French government surrendered, but Free French forces lead by De Gaulle fought until the end of the war. 

Napoleonic Wars/Wars of the Coalitions: 5 out of 7 isn't bad. Napoleon lead in Wars of the Coalition 3 to 7, the French winning the first two while he was in short pants. 

American Revolution: LOL! We wouldn't have existed if it weren't for French support. The British would have CRUSHED the rebellion and we wouldn't be much different than Canada or Australia. 

Funny you mentioned condoms. American soldiers weren't issued them. Some puritanical bullshit. Same with the British. There were more causes of VD than Trench foot. They couldn't outfuck the Canadians though. Canadians got the worse of it. The French issued condoms to their troops. So did the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, Austro-Hungarians, ect.

BloomsdayDevice,1371425672.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c278b,False,"&gt; In Latin, h was always pronounced.

I know this is not really part of your answer to OP's question (an answer which is both clear and accurate), but this warrants a bit of clarification. And I think it also explains to some extent why the distinction is maintained in French.

We teach that Latin always pronounced the 'h, and indeed we have it on good authority from ancient sources that failing to pronounce the 'h' was cause for reproach, BUT it's very clear that aspiration disappeared in spoken Latin quite early. It was retained, artificially, in *written* Latin, and surely educated speakers continued to affect its use--again, just as our ancient sources make clear--but it was gone or evanescent in most dialects already by the end of the Republic. There are plenty of examples of words whose earlier etymologies we can reconstruct and which ought to have had an aspiration, but do not. E.g., *anser* ""goose"" is never spelled with an ""h"", but the Proto-Indo-European root (whence also English ""gander"", with the expected Germanic sound changes in place) must have had an aspiration, and *hanser* must have been an earlier form. Similarly, *er* and *ericius*, both ""hedgehog"", must have been *her* and *hericius* at an early stage, based on comparative evidence, though these spellings (and presumably pronunciations) are never used. And there are numerous other examples where a spelling with the aspiration is in relatively equal alternation with a spelling without (e.g., *aedus* ""[goat] kid"" with etymological and attested *haedus*; *nihil* ""nothing"" alongside *nīl*, with expected contraction and lengthening; *mihi* ""to me* and *mī*). The retention in Classical Latin is artificial, but it's also unquestionably a feature of the prestige dialect of Latin that supplied the literary language (which is why we teach it as part of Latin phonology).

But what's even more interesting, in my opinion, is how aspiration was forcefully introduced into words where it never should have been in the first place. This actually happens a lot: *humere* ""be damp"" from etymological *umere*; *harundo* ""reed"" for more securely reconstructed *arundo*; even in proper nouns, like *Ahenobarbus* (a name that means more or less ""red-beard"", but ought to have been spelled *Aenobarbus*, from the Latin words for ""[of] copper"", *aenus*, and ""beard"", *barba*). We even have commentary from Latin authors who note, with patent mockery, the obvious affectations of speakers who misapply aspiration and end up sounding silly to those who know where it ""belongs"" and where it doesn't.

So it was such a distinctive feature of the best regarded varieties of Latin that pretenders tried, sometimes haphazardly, to insert it even where it didn't belong, sort of like if I started using ""whom""--which is NOT part of my native dialect of English--all over the place, but didn't really know where or how to do it (a phenomenon called ""hypercorrection""). I think this interest in faking the aitch sound, and the association of the sound with more cultured speakers, must have persisted into Romance, and probably contributed to its continued effect--reduced now merely to an obstacle to liaison--in French.",True,False,False,,0,1551509569,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehm2n05,False,t3_awbvov,False,t1_ehluwpt,/r/etymology/comments/awbvov/source_of_muted_and_aspirated_h_in_french/ehm2n05/,False,,1555313592,10,True,False,etymology,t5_2qspe,r/etymology,public,

Ainda na carceragem da PF, o petista, que era muito ligado ao menino, chorou aos soluços ao ouvir o relato da boca do chefe da custódia. Com a foto de Arthur que mantém na cela nas mãos, o ex-presidente repetia que a morte da criança contrariava a lógica da vida. Aliados demonstraram profunda preocupação. Este, avaliam, é o golpe mais duro já sofrido por ele desde a prisão.

 **Meu guri** Em caráter excepcional, a direção da carceragem da PF permitiu a entrada de Gleisi Hoffmann, presidente do PT, na cela. Lula também foi autorizado a falar com os advogados. Arthur chegou a morar com o petista por um período e foi visitar o avô na cadeia por duas vezes.

 **À flor da pele **O próprio Lula pediu que o PT desestimulasse atos políticos[ no velório do neto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/lula-consegue-saida-temporaria-da-prisao-para-velorio-de-neto.shtml). Desta vez, houve extremo cuidado da defesa no encaminhamento do caso. Pela reação do ex-presidente à notícia, ninguém queria dar munição para que a solicitação de saída temporária fosse rejeitada.

 **Passou da conta** Com quem falava, Lula repetia que, ao receber a visita inusitada do chefe da custódia, imaginou que algo teria acontecido a algum familiar, mas disse que jamais poderia projetar a morte do neto de sete anos.

 **Para ontem **Integrantes do STJ acreditam que, pelo ritmo do processo, o recurso de Lula [contra sua condenação](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/em-8-meses-lula-so-apareceu-publicamente-duas-vezes-e-recebeu-centenas-de-visitas.shtml) no caso do tríplex do Guarujá (SP) será julgado até junho.

A liberação de verbas faz parte do pacote de bondades montado para atrair aliados na Câmara e no Senado.

 **Finge que não viu** Jair Bolsonaro admitiu a auxiliares que sua fala sobre a possível redução da idade mínima de mulheres na reforma da Previdência foi um equívoco. A ordem na equipe econômica é seguir defendendo arduamente a proposta tal como ela foi enviada ao Congresso.

O Planalto chamou como representante de uma emissora de TV um jornalista homônimo que, na verdade, trabalha em uma rádio –no fim, nenhum dos dois compareceu.

Broadly speaking, many of America's regions are fairly distinct by ancestral makeup when it comes to original nation of origin. ""The South"" and ""The North"" that you hear about?

He is a known cynic literati who´s reciting a poem he wrote in answer to Kant´s epitaph on how Kant himself´s among the reasons why humanity is inevitably moving towards the realization of eternal peace. The context of it is that he saw the population walking into the slaugther of WW1 and WW2 with cheers and joy, neither events he ever felt particularily positive about and both of which really seemed to diverge wildly from Kant´s proposed straight and narrow towards eternal peace he allegedly set humanity on.

&gt;and why does it feel like Nazi propaganda?

Because the recording technology is from the period, because the person in question is talking in German and because you picked something way out of your league as far as language comprehension goes. We´re talking about an author who´s considered the top of the crop in the literate use of the german language, taking a shot at Kant.
There might be some additional reasons, but everybody and their mums are using English on reddit.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

But yes, absolutely, google translate is garbage for Arabic unless you figure out how to use it properly, and then it's only mediocre.

Things to keep in mind for the basics:

- Arabic has sun and moon consonants. These are consonants where, if they're at the beginning of a word, they morph a definite article in front of them. So ""Al-Nar"" becomes ""An-Nar"". Here's a list for you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_moon_letters

- Arabic is a Semitic language, not an Indo-European one, so it generally cares less about vowels and more about consonants. This may seem weird but, cn yu red this? Then you can understand how Arabic speakers do, and *then* keep in mind that, on top of this intuition, unmarked vowels are pretty natural and have consistent rules anyway. When Arabic does have vowels written, they're with special characters in the form of diacritics (little markers that get tacked onto words like add-ons) or full on letters. The difference is length and emphasis. When vowels get transliterated into English though, they like to do this with Macrons. A kind of diacritic for English that goes over the vowel, making it longer.

In terms of veganism in general, the most important thing is to get the Happy Cow app if you don't have it already (it'll show you places that are fully vegan, fully vegetarian, or just simply have good veg options). There's also a Facebook group called Vegan Travel, where you can search for whatever place you're going to and see past recommendations. If you can't find it, I'll send you the link.

The easiest countries for me were India (both North and South), anywhere in Europe, and Canada/US. There really hasn't been anywhere hard yet tbh. Maybe a resort in Cuba I went to with my family, but that doesn't really count since it was a resort rather than Cuba itself (i.e. I didn't have any choice of restaurant or grocery store). My East Africa trips were before I was vegan, but there were a lot of plant-based foods there too. I haven't actually been to Southeast Asia, but at least in Buddhist countries (and Bali I guess), I would expect there to be a lot of veg options.

Also, I don't want to assume anything, but I have noticed that some new vegan travellers look too much for vegan-only places. While they do exist in places I wouldn't have expected, it's definitely not a guarantee, plus they might have more global foods instead of local cuisine. If you don't find anything on Happy Cow, you can always just search ""Thai foods that are vegan"" or whatever and order the types of meals that come up.
