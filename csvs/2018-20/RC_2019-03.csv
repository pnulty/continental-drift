Ok not a crime case but when I was doing my Masters, my dissertation involved surveying for slow-worms, (c[ute little legless lizards](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEP8AbrVbCY/maxresdefault.jpg) that live in the UK and some of mainland Europe that don't really do much, not rare but no one knows how many are around because they're quite elusive and hard to track since they don't really do much other than burrow, eat slugs and occasionally pop up) to survey for them the easiest thing to encourage them up is to place pieces of felt or corrugated iron down as they will bask under them,

We had two sites, one a small, private site where a relocation had taken part (They're a protected species so if they show up when you want to do building you have to mitigate) and the other was a few patches in a woodland which was our 'wild' site. So on a visit to the woodland I'm walking around with my project partner and the supervisor. My supervisor notices some of the sheets he placed is missing. We notice a group of people have set up camp (Which actually you weren't really meant to do there) and he asks 'Have you seen any sheets of metal lying around?' 

Them 'Nope, not seen any'

He found the missing sheets right there, piled up for their campfire and how can you tell they belong to us?

Io potrei elencare tutta una serie di ragioni per cui la merda italiana, come dice lei, é di fabbricazione autoctona, non europea. I problemi li abbiamo creati noi, non la UE. L'Italia fatica ad attrarre FDI rispetto ai suoi pari europei, e questo non per l'Europa cattiva, ma perché non conviene investire in un paese dove i contenziosi legali tra aziende vengono risolti con tempi biblici e dove i governi dimostrano poca serietá e affidabilitá cambiando le carte in tavola in corso d'opera.

Le delocalizzazioni sono frutto della globalizzazione, non dell'Europa. A casa mia, a Bologna, un'azienda che produceva telai per la Ducati ha chiuso perché quest'ultima ha ingaggiato una societá vietnamita. Le risulta che il Vietnam sia nella UE? O la Cina, altra grande destinazione per le delocalizzazioni?

La sovranitá monetaria? E' un feticcio di voi sovranisti, roba che neanche la bacchetta magica della fata turchina. Peccato che per voi sovranitá monetaria voglia dire svalutazione monetaria. Un giochetto che funziona nel breve periodo ma di cui l'Italia ha abusato per decenni e che porta piú problemi che benefici.

L'Italia ha basato molta della sua concorrenzialitá sul tasso di cambio mantenuto bassissimo per decenni nei confronti dei suoi pari europei e americani, col risultato che gli imprenditori locali hanno smesso di investire in R&amp;D, i dipendenti a salario fisso venivano colpiti duramente, l'inflazione viaggiava a tassi doppi rispetto a quelli attuali e con oscillazioni piú sostenute e i lavoratori italiani si ritrova(va)no con il potere d'acquisto piú basso tra i paesi del blocco occidentale (cosa che permane, vedi Renzi che diceva ""investite in Italia che gli ingegneri italiani prendono poco"").

Senza contare che l'Italia é un paese senza giacimenti di materie prime, quindi quelle le doveva comperare sul mercato internazionale con prezzi denominati, nella maggior parte dei casi, in dollari.

Ora che i paesi emergenti come la Cina, l'India e il Sud Est Asiatico sono entrati in competizione con noi, il giochetto della svalutazione non funziona piú. Sia perché i Cinesi fanno con il renminbi la stessa cosa che facevamo noi, sia perché noi non possiamo competere con il costo del lavoro asiatico.

L'introduzione dell'Euro ha messo fine ad un trucchetto che avrebbe smesso comunque di funzionare, perché una volta che i mercati si globalizzano e i paesi emergenti entrano in competizione con noi, non cambi i meccanismi macroeconomici da solo. Non ci riesce la UE da sola, figuriamoci l'Italietta di Salvini e Di Maio.

&gt; Uno che ignora l'uso della svalutazione per sostenere l'esportazioni e il fatto che l'euro abbia negato questa possibilità creando problemi al Paese è un cazzone che non sa di cosa parla. Ogni riferimento è puramente casuale.

It's not a discussion when you refuse to engage with modern scholarship on the issue.

Salaries are often lower. Here's a page [with some averages for software engineering](https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/it-salaries-software-developer-trends-2018), which is the field I'm in.

At the same time, the cost of living can be higher. [This site compares the US and Germany](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Germany/United-States/Cost-of-living), costs look pretty even based on their numbers, but like I said, it depends on your field. Like I said, the US is more lucrative in my field.

Further problems are that, in any country, it can be difficult to get decent jobs without knowing the language. Even though English is widely spoken as a second language in Europe, you can't work in a technical field where the rest of the office speaks German or French without speaking passable German or French. You see this in the US as well, there are lots of foreign-born engineers in the US, but they generally all speak English at work.

The same issues exist with visas and work permits and such as everywhere, you need to get permission and possibly sponsorship to work in the EU if you're not a citizen, which you don't need if you stay in the US.

I love Europe, and will visit many more times, and could even see retiring or owning a summer home there, but the logistics of working there don't make any sense as a US citizen, especially without fluently speaking any European languages.


As a summary, here are some difficult things to do:
1. Find work that can be done solely in English.
2. Get legal permission for that work.
3. Learn the local language (you'll want to do this regardless of your work situation).
4. Pay taxes (do you need to pay US and European taxes?)

There are other things to, like visiting family now requires an international flight. Can you afford that?

Not that any of these can't be overcome, but I feel like you need a reason to make it worth it. If you actually love the culture of a place so much, it could be worth it, but culture varies a lot by location (even within different cities in a particular country), just like it does in the US, so you won't really know if you like a place until you've been there.

There are plenty of minor conveniences and inconveniences as well, which all vary locally as well. Do you like your big car? You'll likely have to give that up. For that matter, do you like not paying highway tolls? Highway tolls are all over Europe and cost a ton, along with expensive fuel. Do you like the food? Sure, in Italy they have lots of good Italian food, but not a ton of take-out Chinese or tacos. You likely can't even find the ingredients for these in the grocery store.

For that matter, do you like your washer and dryer? Most of southern Europe line-dries their clothes.

RolandBuendia,1488158842.0,,,[],,2∆,dark,text,t2_15rdwm,False,"I think you are overstating the influence of the US in this crisis.

While the US sanctions do not help, the fact is that the Venezuelan economy is simply not competitive. Hugo Chávez was lucky to be president while the oil prices were at record levels. And what did he do? He used these royalties to perpetuate himself in power, pumping up welfare programs towards his political base, and prosecuting his enemies, instead of diversifying the economy or investing in infrastructure. I have met people who fled Venezuela during the “good years” of Chavez.

Once the oil prices went down with a bang, already under Maduro a few years ago, the Venezuelan economy collapsed. And the government saw itself without the means to buy even the most basic items such as medical supplies or food. As a result, the government popularity collapsed. This is when they started playing fast and lose with the constitution and elections. Not a single international organization came forward to say that the last presidential elections were fair and square. Quite the contrary, it has received widespread condemnation. As an example, even the European Union has called for new elections.

Guaido claims to be an interim president, as the leader of congress, because the constitution says it should be the case, when elections could not be held. He is in it just to order a call for new elections. Not to be one a president for years to come.

To call him a US puppet, would also be the same as to call him a puppet of the European Union, pretty much all of Latin America, Japan, and most of the free world. Maduro has only the support of Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba. Not exactly the best examples of democratic governments.

.

I have long been of the opinion that one of the worst outcomes of the Thirty Years' War was the fragmentation of the Low Countries. What a marvelous counterfactual had those countries managed consolidate and serve as a counterweight to the Germanies, France and England.
.

But of course Europe and the Old World in general has as long a history of atomization as it does of consolidation. That is why you get people self-identifying as a Walloon or Flemish. (Or Catalan, or Tuscan, or whatever)  As the American philosopher P J O'Rourke pointed out it seems ""Everyone with a lisp and a pet name for God wants his own country."" 
.

This strikes New World people as odd. Our nations have always been multi-ethnic, multilingual and with few ideas of a national religion. You can be an American, Brazilian or Argentine without adopting the national language, faith or dress. 
.

Yes, New World People did their best to wipe out the indigenous people. This is all the more vivid in our history because it is such a strange thing. 
.

In the Old World, governments tend to have a national ethic identity. Germany is a place to be a German. At some basic, DNA-level you are expected to conform. America is a place to have a good time and get rich.  Nobody much cares if you look like an American (whatever that means) just pay cash. 
.

It is hard to find examples of that in the New World of a desire for an ethnicity-pure state. There are some. In the Old World there are endless examples. 
 

The European Union had long worked against this. After the trauma of two world wars, and under the threat of a multinational threat to the east, Europe moved to become one. 
.

It worked great. Two generations did not see a war. Wealth increased. But now spurred by ethnic identity, economic problems, and perhaps Russian meddling the pressure to break apart is increasing again. 
.

To us New World people, it all seems quite odd and against self-interest. An independent Catalonia for what good purpose? Sure, the internal arrangements of Europe are for the Europeans to decide, but after setting the world on fire three times, we would have hoped you had moved on.

&gt; Angus &amp; Julia Stone are an Australian acoustic folk-pop duo consisting of siblings Julia Stone and Angus Stone from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Their decision to collaborate was taken at the beginning of 2006. Prior to that, both had performed as solo artists at open mic nights but utilised the other as a backing partner.  Ultimately they came up with the same idea, “Why don’t we play together? It kind of made a lot of sense”. In terms of composing the material, they write on their own, then work together on structure and harmonies.
They have released three studio albums, A Book Like This (2007), which peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart; Down the Way (2010), reached No. 1; and their self-titled album (2014). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 they won five awards from nine nominations: winning Album of the Year, Best Adult Alternative Album, Best Cover Art and Producer of the Year for Down the Way and Single of the Year for ""Big Jet Plane"". 

&gt; Released in March 2010, their album “Down The Way” debuted at #1 on Australia’s ARIA Charts enjoying a remarkable 12 months inside the ARIA Top 20 albums chart. It went on to pick up Album Of The Year at the 2010 ARIA Awards and includes the platinum selling Single Of The Year ‘Big Jet Plane’; which was most notably voted No.1 on the 2011 annual Triple j Hottest 100. The album has hit triple platinum (210,000+) sales in the Stones’ home country, the only Australian artist album to reach this milestone on the current ARIA Top 50 albums chart.

&gt; European audiences have also fallen head over heels in love with “Down The Way”. Reaching platinum (100,000+) album status in France, supported by a hugely successful film sync with ‘Big Jet Plane’ for the movie, Les Émotifs Anonymes. Extended sold out tours are not limited to native Australia with the 2011 French tour including 5 ‘Le Trianon’ Paris shows selling out 2 months before the tour commenced. The UK, Germany, Austria, Spain &amp; Portugal are all just a taste of the frequent European tour destinations with sell out shows. In the US, their dramatic and lush soundscapes have found homes on prime time dramas; Grey’s Anatomy and Private Practice and key slots at iconic US festivals Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo and Coachella.

&gt; Travelling has been an integral part of the Stone’s musical story, so it’s not surprising they opted to record “Down The Way” in a number of diverse locations around the globe; an old sawmill on the river banks of Fowey in Cornwall, a studio in Brooklyn, a water tank in Coolangatta, London - and Queens in New York. 

&gt; “Down The Way” marked their debut as producers, taking full control of their sound without losing the spirit of what made the first record ‘A Book Like This’ so special.  There has been a subtle shift of gear, represented by a growing confidence in their abilities as artists and the music follows suit as it flows easily through sparse and rich textured arrangements without losing any of its etherealness and charm. 

&gt; With an incredible response to “Down The Way” from all corners of the globe, Angus and Julia Stone will take some well-deserved time off and prepare for their next step along a remarkable musical journey.

Do you know why Europe and the Commonwealth have social medicine (which has cured my GF of cancer and birthed her son, and taken care of her family for the cost of $39 per month)?

It’s because Europe was destroyed in WWII.

Prior to their ruin, they were just like we are, with profitable private insurers. Like Lloyd’s of London, who practically invented insurance.

But when WWII happened, everything was destroyed and the nations of Europe were in Total War. At that time, if you were a doctor, you were an army doctor. If there was a safe hospital, it was a military hospital because everything was total war. And when the smoke cleared and the rubble was shoved away, there were a lot of sick and wounded people and only the government could step in to help. 

So that’s why they have social medicine while we do not. We were never destroyed, like that. And so unlike them, the profit-based system of public health and welfare was able to merrily chug away as it still does, with you sending pay to Aetna or Blue Cross or whomever and they *still* fuck you.

1) When Israeli soldiers commit a war crime, they are punished accordingly (as well they should be). They are not celebrated, they are not hailed as heroes. They do not profit in any way from their crime. They go to prison.

2) Conversely, when Palestinian ""soldiers"" commit murder and other war crimes, they are rewarded handsomely. They are not punished in any way whatsoever. They and their families are paid money that comes from aid from the US and EU (taxpayer money) in perpetuity. They are hailed as national heroes and celebrated forever. 

You probably don't like that, because it doesn't fit your narrative, but those are FACTS. That is a stark difference. Here is another... an Israeli soldier committing a bonafide war crime is a rare event. By contrast, the commission of war crimes is literally a way of life for Palestinians. The Israeli leadership is never calling for their soldiers to commit war crimes. Conversely, Palestinian leadership openly calls for murder and genocide on a daily basis. There is no equivalence here.

That's a neighbourhood in Cairo called Manshiyet Naser. It's where the Christians live: the Coptic sect, an ancient form of Christianity from when Egypt was part of the Roman Empire. 

Their neighbourhood is literally full of garbage. They process it on the ground floors of those buildings and resell it, mostly to buyers in Asia who reprocess it for use in manufacturing.

The Muslim areas are mostly nicer, but still shabby. I went to a wedding in a sort of upper-middle-class apartment complex near El-Ma'adi and I'd say it was slightly nicer than being in a Soviet era suburb in an Eastern European city.

\- Swoosh on the right side of the left shoe is covering the letter A. This is **good**. The swoosh should be touching/covering/or be virtually right next to (with no gap) the letter A in USA. [https://imgur.com/1WdeUoQ](https://imgur.com/1WdeUoQ) my retail AHE for reference.

\- Swoosh on the sole of the left side of the left shoe and right side of the right shoe is **placed like my retail**: [https://imgur.com/t24LLRE](https://imgur.com/t24LLRE) This is good. It should only be the bottom portion of the swoosh on the sole. A lot of fakes will have it too low.

\- Sizable gap between the pointy part of the swoosh and the leather where the laces come out on the  left side of the left shoe. This is **good**. Here is my retail for reference: [https://imgur.com/PNPuxIp](https://imgur.com/PNPuxIp) A lot of reps will either hit or miss the mark on these by having it way too close to the leather where the laces come out.

\- **Would like to see the right side of the right shoe**.

\- NIKE on the back of both shoes **have correct placement**. Current fakes have it where it's in the middle, but authentic pairs have it just a tad bit down. Here is mine for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/kUtjZw1](https://imgur.com/a/kUtjZw1) The NIKE impression and the fuzziness around it is hella clean too. Indication that these are legit.

\- **Tan have correct text placement**. Text placement of laces should be like this: [https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0/See](https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0/See)how ""SHOELACES"" is close to the ends? Most reps have it far away. No fakes have this perfected yet. They have it close, but not 1:1

\- **Need pictures of the teal laces laid out to see text placement**. 

\- Plastic on toebox is **nice and curved**. This is good. A lot of Fakes it have where it's bigger and it's not a perfect curve. [http://imgur.com/a/BcGwPCq](http://imgur.com/a/BcGwPCq)this is an example of a fake AHE toebox. All of them have this.

\- Ziptie is nice and thin. This is **good**. Retail ziptie is supposed to be thin like. My retail [https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0](https://imgur.com/EP3eQn0). Fakes will have it where it's thick.

\- **An indication that these are legit is that the shoes have a bell curve looking at the heel**. All fakes right now lack that curve. This is the most distinguishable difference between fakes and retails as of this writing. [https://imgur.com/tuEvgrk](https://imgur.com/tuEvgrk) and [https://imgur.com/mwOHBEW](https://imgur.com/mwOHBEW) See how the fake (grims) is ""fat"" while the AHE has the body of an instagrm model?

\- Padding on the opening where you put your feet is thin. **This is good**. Fakes have it thicker while retail is thinner: [http://imgur.com/a/7B7KmaX](http://imgur.com/a/7B7KmaX)

\- **No picture of the insole to see size sticker**. I know that US, AUS, and EU have their respective size stickers. [https://imgur.com/a/bzVeSSy](https://imgur.com/a/bzVeSSy) Retail for reference. Your paid must not be from the locations listed.

Here’s why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol’ American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let’s see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren’t looking at it–you’re looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it’s because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you’re going to say: “But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!” Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Ela e sua irmã Reem* mudaram de endereço pelo menos 13 vezes, vivendo em um limbo jurídico e com o medo constante de serem mandadas de volta para um país que poderia puni-las com a morte.

As irmãs sauditas, detidas em Hong Kong depois de fugirem durante as férias em família, disseram à BBC que sofreram abusos violentos em casa e que foram tratadas ""como empregadas domésticas"" por parentes do sexo masculino.

Violência doméstica
-------------------

Com idades entre 18 e 20 anos, elas cresceram em uma ""típica família muçulmana"" na Arábia Saudita, onde as mulheres são colocadas sob tutela e muitas vezes acompanhadas de perto. Ambas não viam nada além de um ""futuro sombrio"" para si mesmas.

""Eles observam cada passo que damos, controlam todos os detalhes da nossa vida"", diz Rawan.

Elas, que assumiram pseudônimos para proteger suas identidades, renunciaram ao Islã, alegando que é uma religião que ""deixa os homens controlarem as mulheres"". Essa renúncia, de acordo com as leis sauditas, é considerada um crime punível com a morte.

Os diversos casos recentes de mulheres sauditas em tentativas de fuga da violência de suas famílias chamaram a atenção da comunidade internacional.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  As irmãs sauditas têm 18 e 20 anos   Longo planejamento
------------------

Há seis meses, as duas irmãs estavam a caminho da Austrália para pedir asilo, quando autoridades diplomáticas sauditas as interceptaram durante uma escala em Hong Kong.

As mulheres disseram à BBC que estavam economizando dinheiro e planejando sua fuga desde 2016.

As irmãs esperaram por uma viagem em família ao Sri Lanka, que coincidiu com o aniversário de 18 anos de Rawan - quando tiveram mais chances de ter em mãos seus passaportes, que seu pai mantinha trancados em segurança em casa.

Sob o ""sistema de tutela masculina"" da Arábia Saudita, uma mulher precisa de permissão para obter um passaporte, viajar para fora do país, estudar no exterior com uma bolsa do governo, casar, sair da prisão ou até mesmo sair para centros de acolhida de vítimas de abuso.

Em setembro passado, elas conseguiram ir em sigilo até o aeroporto internacional de Colombo, no Sri Lanka, vestiram calças jeans e embarcaram em sua jornada para a Austrália.

Mas enquanto se preparavam para a conexão de voos em Hong Kong, ficaram retidas por homens que pegaram seus passaportes e disseram que o voo havia sido cancelado.

----------------------------

Reem e Rawan dizem que se lembraram de Dina Ali Lasloom, que foi detida a caminho da Austrália em abril de 2017 e retornou forçosamente à Arábia Saudita do aeroporto de Manila, nas Filipinas.

O paradeiro de Lasloom é incerto, apesar de ela ter passado algum tempo em um abrigo em Riad.

As irmãs dizem que se recusaram a ser intimidadas pelas autoridades sauditas em Hong Kong.

""Não éramos um alvo fácil, conhecemos nossos direitos"", disse Reem. ""Eles são os únicos que fizeram a coisa errada, não nós. Só queremos sobreviver.""

Elas discutiram os planos e se recusaram a embarcar em um avião para Dubai.

As irmãs conseguiram seus documentos de viagem de volta, mas naquele momento eles estavam dentro da área de trânsito do aeroporto de Hong Kong sem nenhum voo marcado.

-------------------------

Reem e Rawan são o segundo caso rumoroso de mulheres fugindo da Arábia Saudita só neste ano.

Em janeiro, o Canadá concedeu asilo a Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, de 18 anos, que ficou presa no principal aeroporto de Bangcoc, na Tailândia, tentando chegar à Austrália.

Ela se recusara a voar para o Kuwait, onde sua família estava esperando, e se fechou em seu quarto de hotel no aeroporto, atraindo atenção internacional.

A ONG Human Rights Watch registrou diversos casos de mulheres tentando fugir de suas famílias nos últimos anos, sob o risco de enfrentar ""uma vida de abuso"" quando são forçadas a retornar.

De acordo com as estatísticas mais recentes citadas pela agência Associated Press, 577 mulheres sauditas tentaram fugir de suas casas em 2015.

Mas é provável que o número real seja muito mais alto, porque muitas famílias não denunciam as fugitivas devido ao estigma social, informou a AP.

---------------

""Quando começamos a ver outras sobreviventes que fugiram para outros países em busca de asilo, achamos que era possível também [para nós]"", diz Rawan.

""Há pessoas que nos inspiram.""

Na Arábia Saudita, elas ""não tinham dignidade"", diz ela.

""Eles me obrigaram a cozinhar [para eles] desde que eu tinha 12 anos. Quando minha [pequena] irmã nasceu, nós a criamos.""

As irmãs dizem que foram constantemente humilhadas pelo pai e pelos irmãos do sexo masculino, que também as castigaram com espancamento.

""Minha vida era apenas para servi-los. Eu estava muito deprimida, não via nenhum futuro, eles não se importavam com nenhuma das minhas necessidades ou com minha educação - o único foco era me criar como uma boa esposa.""

--------------

Desde que entraram em território chinês, as irmãs dizem que foram perseguidas por sua família e pelo consulado saudita.

Com os passaportes agora suspensos, elas solicitaram um visto de emergência ""em um terceiro país"" e aguardam a ajuda das pessoas, comendo macarrão e se preocupando com seu futuro incerto.

""Nossa vida em Hong Kong é basicamente nos esconder, nos esconder o tempo todo. Nós nos mudamos 13 vezes: albergues, hotéis, abrigos, casas das pessoas"", diz Rawan.

""Temos medo de ir a qualquer lugar por nossa conta. É tudo envolto em medo.""

'Fora das sombras'
------------------

Apesar de todo o imbróglio, as irmãs dizem que agora estão ""fora das sombras"".

Reem, que estudava literatura inglesa na universidade, diz que sonha em escrever sobre as vidas das irmãs na Arábia Saudita, escrevendo poesia e descobrindo o mundo.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Ao menos 577 mulheres sauditas tentaram fugir de suas casas em 2015   Ela diz que também sonha em ""viver em um país onde respeitam as mulheres e os direitos humanos"" e onde possa falar livremente.

Rawan também diz que só quer ""viver em segurança"" e levar a ""vida feliz"" em um país onde pode fazer escolhas.

""Eu sonho em completar meus estudos, sou realmente apaixonada por eles"", diz Rawan. ""Eu quero estudar biologia e ter um doutorado em genética.""

&gt; They weren't making this decision because they are some caring  organization, ensuring everyone is safe. They know Tigres fans and their  whole family will turn up in droves, that is why they are chopping the  stadium in half. 

1. Organizations can make decisions for more than one reason. Getting ahead of problems and trying to create the best environment possible is not necessarily exclusive to trying to make money (which then goes back into the team and club). 
2. If their fans are going to show up in droves, why implement a policy based on denial of that fact?

&gt; So if we did go with my 3,000 allocation you honestly think we would all  of a sudden have 10,000 people being thrown out? Fights breaking out?  Even though modern football history tells us that even the most  passionate of fans have never created this situation because of home and  away sections 

My comment was referencing some of your other points in the thread (admittedly not clearly), in which you suggest the Dynamo security should be removing disruptive fans:

&gt;If you’re a Tigres fan and buy tickets in home section then know you can  be removed from the stadium, if you sit and don’t react, no problem   
&gt;  
&gt; you put at the bottom of the purchase agreement that the tickets are  solely for Dynamo fans. If there is any disruption from away fans in the  home section you are removed by the stewards    
&gt;  
&gt; The stewards around the field are not just there to stop pitch invasions but to direct staff to trouble in the stands   
&gt;  
&gt; A Tigres fan sits there and does nothing then I don’t really care. I  have been the away fan in the home, you just have to be a good little  boy if not I knew what was happening to me. 

If seats aren't allocated correctly (in this case generously), there's a greater potential for trouble to break out. That in turn requires more personnel, especially if you plan on being hardline and removing fans that don't fit a certain level of decorum, which is what you yourself are suggesting should be the case. 

&gt; I'm not skirting the ""containment"" idea, again, it's not rocket science,  you place them in the away section, in the corner. Extra stewards  create a barrier between them and the home, using empty seating as well. 

I'm not sure why you keep bringing up other leagues, especially European ones that have a much longer history of soccer and more ingrained supporter's culture, but I've seen the Dynamo do this plenty of times as well. It's not a new idea, as you point out yourself. The thing that you're ignoring is that the normal rules don't apply. Tigres fans are going to attend the game, period. If they were given 3,000 seats in a corner they'd buy tickets elsewhere. These fans don't often get the chance to see their team play, and they're going to take the opportunity not only for club pride, but in some cases out of national pride as well. 

&gt; This is about a team that consistently given the option of, setting a  better standard, long term success or a quick buck, choose the quick  buck every time 

Better standards and long term success often come as a result of running a profitable enterprise. At the end of the day this is a business, and making money is the bottom line. If allowing Tigres to have half the stadium brings in profits that allow us to get a 3rd DP or even TAM player, then the gambit succeeds and fosters better performances and long-term success. 

Keep in mind that we also have a new CBO and Chief Revenue Officer. They were brought in for a reason. They've already made improvements to the stadium and game day experience, and they're going to try new things to see what works.

There IS  a risk of cancer, but you have breasts you have a greater risk of cancer! 

&amp;#x200B;

But if you remove your testis you will have to take hormone therapy the rest of your life. Is that worth it for you? Many doctors don't make that clear- thats a choice YOU can make!! Don't let doctors convince you to have surgery. You DONT have to have surgery if you don't want to!!! PLEASE KNOW THAT!

Please be careful. The medical world is still quite backward when it comes to Intersex people. They want to do surgery first, force it on you. But really what intersex people REALLY need is Therapy. Counseling to understand who they are, and what that means.

It has become increasingly harder since Freedom of Movement. FoM has made immigration skyrocket unsustainably in a short space of time and this has made immigration a big political issue within only a relatively short amount of time. 

In order to try and control the numbers, the rules for non-EU immigrants have become increasingly more painful. We can’t control EU immigration so we control non-EU numbers. EU numbers then increase even more steeply. Rules for non-EU immigrants become more and more cruel and unjust in a vain attempt to stem the overall numbers. 

Now, EU immigration will plateau. Maybe rise gradually at times. No more need to have horrible rules for non-EU immigrants to try and stem the overall numbers. The Home Office has a huge backlog and can’t cope with processing these horrendous rules. It’s unsustainable. The rules are unsustainable. In time, the rules will soften for them. For everyone.

There definetly is a lot of cooperation between the countries, its especially great for traveling and making new friends. Only be aware that that isnt especially noticeable in every-day life but something you will most likely only experience when traeling or working in an international company. Also, there is alot of openness and many accepting people, you will quickly find a young and vibrant scene in any bigger city. Only be aware that in Europe, just as everywhere else there are still narrow-minded people and there is also some national drama all of the time, you probably just dont hear about that as much in the US. And it maybe doesnt impact life as much as in the US, I dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

I definetly dont want to discourage you from coming here, you sound like a lively and passionate young person so you are most welcome :) 

I only want you to be aware that its not just a dream, that you think of all the practical aspects of it. Where exactly do you want to live? Maybe make a list of places and what you know about them and if you realize you dont know much about a place, look it up, go to the subreddits and ask people. Make sure you know how you can support your life, how are you going to earn money here? Do you need further education (likely if you are just 18 years old)? What are the exact regulations on your visa?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And I did thinking about going to school there witch I heard isn’t that expensive. 

I can only speak for what I know from Germany, University here is quite cheap (\~250 Euros a semester for which you will also get a semester public transport ticket for your city/state) but hard to get into, especially if you dont know the language. You have to have a good highschool degree for most of them. You should really think about what you want to do here because for almost everything you will need some type of degree, be it from a university or an apprenticeship.

&gt;This might be my only change to go and live there so I really want to take the chance even if it’s a long and hard work ahead

You might be right on the first part and you are definetly right on the second part. Learning the language and adjusting to the new culture, learning new things will be hard but if you keep at it will be worth it.

The power of the ruler stemmed from the people, not from the God. 

This concept that laws and rules of day-to-day conduct are given legitimacy only through the will of the people was a tremendous shift with far reaching implications. Religion was pushed over to become only one of the things influencing the public discourse instead of THE THING. The trauma of religious wars in 16th/17th century greatly accelerated this process as the religious tolerance was grudgingly accepted as the way to live - which means religion was moved over to the personal domain as opposed to overwhelmingly public domain as it was before.

GrahamDSC,1479717861.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_12yrl7,False,"Firstly - you need to take another look at the definition of 'shill' - it most certainly is an insult.  

You'll note that on the Asian Le Mans TV coverage I wear the Series shirt - that's because they employ me to commentate, explain and enlighten.  There is nothing false about the information I am giving out, and my relationship with the most important consumers of the information, the teams, shows absolutely zero sign of any irritation that I am getting it wrong.

You would be correct about there needing to be a plan for a season - however, the difference between the single seater team owner you cite and the reality of international sportscar racing is that for very many of the professional teams in sportscars an entry in the biggest races is an absolutely essential part of the multi-million dollar/ euro/ pound commercial package - with the exception of one-offs like the Macao Grand Prix, single seater racing is commercially viable ONLY over a full season.

It is possible to formulate an international sportscar racing season without the biggest races - but in my experience, those teams with ambition inevitably have to target, budget for and fund the big ones - LM24, Daytona, Sebring, Spa 24, Nurburgring 24 etc etc in order to attract the drivers, sponsors and eventually factories to come and play.

Ref your comment on container loads - that's a very different model than occurs in IMSA - for the IMSA teams it is not containers (which can be transported by multiple third party carriers) - but their own haulers, with their own staff - that do the literal heavy lifting - That is a significant additional investment in hardware, transportation and staff costs.

WEC has the same for most teams for the European races with containerisation for the rest, and a calendar that has been designed to ensure that for the most part seaborne freight is used - Not cheap, not even a little bit, but not nearly as expensive as air freight (though some teams do choose to do that instead for some races).

Asian Le Mans is an entirely containerised Championship - again hence the choices ref calendars and gaps in the calendars. 

I believe you are confusing David Chen (from GT team TSRT) with David Cheng (from Jackie Chan DC Racing) - I'd be interested in just how successful or otherwise you think that (JCDC) programme has been on the sponsorship front - I suspect you may be surprised!

Ref sponsors and WEC/ LM24 - you are very, very wrong about their expectations and their own activities - take a look at any WEC race paddock, hospitality area etc - there is activity - sometimes considerable activity - bit nothing even on the same planet as Le Mans.  That's not the organiser's choice, its the sponsor choosing - Nobody is stopping them from spending money at Fuji, Silverstone etc - it is simply not their primary, or often even their secondary, priority.

Finally - ref not enough attention being given to the ELMS etc - in 2019 we'll have an entry capped at 41 cars - including 18 full season LMP2 cars - it seems the teams are pretty happy that they have a plan that they can sustain.  In Asia we saw 50% growth year on year for the Asian Le Mans Series.

WEC is a whole different ball game - as a global product it relies on factory money, and global sponsors, to push it forward - though the professional LMP2 and GTE AM teams are a massive chunk of both the budget and the 'show' - the key is finding something sustainable that the factories can hang their hats on - And it's there that the powers that be have not done a great job in transitioning from the days of Audi vs Porsche vs Toyota, nor in having a structure in place that allowed others to easily join in at affordable start-up budgets.

The next few weeks are going to be interesting - and critical

How Brexit Britain Managed to Lose All of Its Friends
March 01, 2019

The sight of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a self-professed “best friend” to Britain, berating Theresa May’s Brexit strategy this week was telling. Even at a time when France and Italy are at diplomatic loggerheads, Viktor Orban is painting the European Union as a menace to society, and Ireland’s Big Tech-friendly tax model is under fire from the European Commission, the bloc’s 27 member states have more or less stuck together in talks with the U.K. They’ve certainly toed the negotiating line laid down by Brussels.

All of this matters as Theresa May considers requesting a possible delay to Brexit. Given that she would need the unanimous support of EU leaders, there will be strings attached.

May has used up a lot of goodwill over the past two years. She kicked off negotiations with unpleasant hardball tactics, misjudged Britain’s ability to extract trade terms with the EU that were just as good as being a member, and pressured other leaders to sign off on a draft deal in November that she herself has undermined since.

Her January promise to return to Brussels and renegotiate an Irish border provision that she’d only just agreed enraged many in the EU capital. Philippe Lamberts, an member of the European Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, told me afterwards that the U.K.’s unreliable behavior demonstrated exactly why the Irish backstop was needed, and that European unity would hold. It has.

It’s pretty damning that the U.K. has failed to build any coalition within the EU that might help sway crucial votes or support its case. Core members like Germany and the Netherlands – despite facing respective hits of 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) and 4 billion euros to yearly exports if Britain crashes out without a deal – were quickly alienated by the U.K.’s logic-defying demands for preferential access to a market that it wanted to leave without stopping it from signing its own free-trade deals.

And while smaller pro-British countries such as Poland and Hungary have been among the country’s most outspoken supporters, they’ve consistently defended the indivisibility of the single market and their own citizens’ rights. As net beneficiaries of EU funds, they have good reason to stick to the Brussels script.

The central and eastern states that might have found common ground with Britain as a tough ally against Russia and a check on the dominant euro-zone countries like France and Germany have failed to rally to its cause on Brexit. Faith in the broader NATO umbrella has probably outweighed fears that Britain will drift away from military cooperation into isolationism. Most are driven by fears of being left behind by closer EU integration rather than inspired by Britain’s break for freedom. Poland’s criticism of the Irish backstop found little endorsement in the region, according to European policy academic Monika Brusenbauch Meislova, highlighting May’s forlorn task in trying to find cracks in the EU’s united front.

What happens next? As the debate moves from the terms of Brexit to whether Europe will allow May a few months delay, European unity is likely to hold, according to Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European Studies at Oxford university. If there’s evidence that this will help get May’s withdrawal deal over the line, much will depend on Germany, where lawmakers have expressed support for an extension of a few months. But if May takes negotiations to another “no deal” cliff edge after that, her isolation may prove fatal to her own political career.

When did other EU countries begin their planning for a No Deal Brexit? 

At that point it's foreseeable.

 *Govt could have issued a prior information notice (at any point up to 6 months before}) that allows it to carry out a quicker tender process. They gave ferry companies two weeks to submit bids. You can give companies 15 days on an accelerated procedure and be compliant. 

So Brexit was foreseeable and the timescales still worked if the Govt issued something earlier about the possibility of going out to tender. They could have done so when they were engaging with ferry companies when scoping it out. 

I've done an accelerated procedure before, its not difficult (it takes a few hours to issue a PIN if you need to look things up - like how to do one), it's basic incompetence.

The other issue would be prior case law (NGS vs Transport Scotland - IANAL) received advice that 4 months is required for a standard tender, start to finish.

The federal budget is 4 trillion dollars. Unfunded liabilities are what? 100 trillion? Maybe you're talking the favorite topic of the brainless child: healthcare. Well, you should go check out the OECD figures that show public expenditure for healthcare in the USA represents a full 50% of all dollars spent. Compared to all your ""socialist"" countries that spend 60-70%.

It's so ironic how supporters of capitalism always talk about socialism being nice on paper but looking completely different in practice. Your ideal ""free market"" capitalism has never existed and will never exist. This is what capitalism looks like in practice. Nobody cares about your moral or hypothetical arguments in favor of free markets and unrestrained competition. What the actual capitalists care about is making money, and they're smart enough to figure out that they can make a lot more of it if they get the state to tilt the table in their favor. Even if you could hit a big reset button that got rid of all government corruption and regulation and taxes, we would be right back where we are now within a few decades. The driving force of corruption is the capitalists themselves, not the state.

&gt;And here we go: look how great Europe does it right? Actually, you have to cherry pick pretty hard to find a European country that isn't on the verge of bankruptcy. When you find one, the population is probably the size of Colorado. Fuck you guys all have the same stupid arguments. 

States literally cannot go bankrupt under normal circumstances. As long as people believe your state is stable, you can always just issue more bonds and devalue your currency. The only reason bankruptcy is a potential problem in Europe is because they're locked into a currency they have no control over. It has nothing to do with their welfare policies.

&gt;You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Regan merely cut taxes and slowed the regulatory steam roller and it created an entire new industry worth trillions of dollars that has massively - massively - improved the standard of living for the entire world.

.

Few thinkers can speak about global governance with as much authority as Kishore Mahbubani. A former President of the United Nations Security Council, Permanent Secretary of Singapore’s Foreign Ministry and Dean of the renowned Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, he has been named “the muse of the Asian century” and listed among the top 100 most influential public intellectuals in the world by the Financial Times

.

**Q: How should the US and Europe position themselves in a global system dominated by Asia?**

A: Europe and the US need to face the fact that the last two centuries of Western dominance have been a historical aberration, and that aberration is coming to a natural end. They need to be ready to deal with a world in which they remain strong, but in which their relative share of global GDP has gone down. If your share of GDP goes down, you need to adopt a new strategic approach, 

.

**Q: The US is increasingly focusing its ire on China’s Made in China 2025 strategy. What is your view on this strategy?**

A: I think it’s legitimate for China to aspire to become a technological superpower in its own right. Frankly, I think that China is going to succeed. The US should not complain about what China is doing, and instead ask itself what the American response should be. But here, the ideology of people like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer—who believes that all government-led industrial policies don’t work—gets in the way.

If industrial policies don’t work, then why not allow this one to fail? If you complain about it, that suggests you believe it’s going to work. Now, if it’s going to work in China, why doesn’t the United States launch its own comprehensive national strategy to maintain its technological lead? Instead of complaining about Made in China 2025, they should have a Made in America 2025.

.

Q: sentiment among the US elite has turned against China. What has caused this change?

A: I don’t know, it’s mystifying, but it has happened. I think there is a growing awareness that China is becoming bigger and stronger. Even though Americans don’t like talking about America becoming number two, subconsciously they must realize that America is moving toward that status. Instead of looking in the mirror and asking what mistakes you have made, it’s always easier to find a scapegoat, and China is the obvious one. The danger is that when you look for a scapegoat, you ignore the core structural issues that America has to deal with in this new era.

First of all, Europeans still had to get to and from their trading posts. If they weren't on good terms with indigenous peoples in the surrounding area, this could be a daunting and dangerous task depending on how isolated the individual post in question may have been.

Also, not all trade occurred at trading posts. I don't have the exact figures to cite right now, but I believe that throughout much of New France, for example, the majority of trade was actually carried out by licensed *voyageurs* and independent *coureurs de bois*, who traveled via canoe and over land to trade directly with indigenous peoples. This was inherently risky work and it demanded being on good terms with the indigenous peoples whose territories these Frenchmen were crossing.

Finally, even accepting the idea that imperial powers were primarily concerned with trade revenue, there were other issues at hand that involved indigenous peoples. For example, territory in the Americas regularly changed hands into the 19th century, and indigenous peoples were an important part of these power struggles. European powers, and especially their representatives actually on the ground in the Americas, understood just how much power indigenous peoples tended to hold, and actively courted them as allies during war and even peacetime. This often involved gifts, including manufactured goods (and, especially in the later colonial era, guns). Once again, turning back to the example of New France, the French gave so many of these gifts that they actually lost money on their colony for quite a while, this because it was more important for them to retain ""power"" by keeping their indigenous allies from turning toward the British instead.",True,False,False,,0,1551450849,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehk0m30,False,t3_avrfln,True,t1_ehjp3hz,/r/history/comments/avrfln/how_do_we_know_how_the_borders_of_the_countries/ehk0m30/,False,,1555202343,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,r/history,public,

willdeletein2020,1551165515.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3avtuugv,False,"A 12-year-old boy raped his six-year-old sister because he wanted to re-enact a scene from the video game Grand Theft Auto, a court has heard.

The boy is said to have attacked his victim on numerous occasions at their family home while adults were in another room or asleep, including on Christmas Day.

One incident was apparently triggered after the child watched footage of a sexual act in the game, which has an 18-rating under the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) classification scheme.

While it is unclear which scene the boy was attempting to replicate, controversy has long surrounded the ability for players to pick up sex workers in the game and perform a range of acts with them. 

Swindon Youth Court was told he had decided to recreate the scene by raping his younger sibling, who had been in the room at the time.

The incidents were uncovered after the girl confided about what her brother had made her do to a friend at school, who then told their teacher.  

The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared before a judge to admit three counts of rape and one of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity.

His mother looked close to tears as the charges were read out in court, holding the boy’s hand before he was given a 12-month referral order.

If he completes the order in the out-of-town therapeutic facility where he currently lives, the four charges to which he pleaded guilty will be removed from his criminal record.


His defence lawyer, Gordon Hotson, said the centre represented a “one-off opportunity to sort this young man out”, adding he had been “opening up to staff and working well with them”.

The boy, who is from Swindon and has since turned 13, sat impassively for most of the hearing, but smiled when the judge spoke to him about football – a sport he hopes to play professionally one day.

The judge also asked what he would do if he had the opportunity to commit his crimes again, to which the teenager responded: “I would stop myself, I have learned that it’s wrong.”

**Prosecutor Russell Pyne told the court: “He had been watching sex acts in porn and wanted to see what it was like for himself.”**

Republicans have opposed Medicare for all, have wanted to cut social security, wanted to cut welfare and food stamps (which affects whites in republican states more than anyone else), funding to public schools etc. 

This where I know you have no economic knowledge. Deficits are nothing more than when the government spends more than it takes in. Tax cuts are often the biggest contributors to deficits because the gov then has to borrow money which adds to our national debt, which is different than the deficit. That’s how the deficit increases. We do not receive the same income and most of those tax cuts go to outsourcing/Research/stock buybacks, things that don’t benefit most Americans, so it doesn’t have the same impact on the economy.

Just be virtue of being picked in the second round, any type of NBA production is appreciated. For reasons why, well... Bolden's versatility on defense has shown me the sky is the limit on that side of the floor. He can already switch on to wing-ish type players and he's shown some rim protection and shot blocking. His problems are that he's undisciplined on defense for which he commits too many fouls, does not have enough strength and weight to defend larger players, does not create enough turnovers with his length, and does not have the box out abilities needed to stop offensive rebounds. Very little of these shortcomings scare me, because he will grow more comfortable, he will grow more disciplined, he will gain weight, and he will get smarter.

Offensively, he's improved significantly since the start of the new year, where he's shooting upwards of 35% from three, and has attacked closeouts to get to the rim. In europe and summer league he showed real passing ability, hopefully we some of that one day. He attacks the offensive glass, but it's pretty fruitless and I personally care more about him getting back on defense. 

Right now he's not very good. He is not nba ready yet, the team needs him to be a center, he is not a center. He is a 4 right now. He struggles making quick reads in the pick and roll defensively as a center, and has show better weakside shotblocking and nice smothers then straight verticality. He doesn't rebound as a center because he's never played against the big centers of today. He's our best bet against Ibaka/Horford/Lopez with Jo out the game. But will also get eaten alive if Horford/Gasol/Lopez post up.

TheSukis,1466873629.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_z09fb,False,"In the strictest sense, pedophilia is sexual attraction to children.  We consider children, in this context, to be individuals who have not yet hit puberty.

Once a human body has made it through a sufficient portion of puberty and possesses the physical characteristics of being sexually mature (i.e. able to reproduce effectively), it is natural for adults to feel sexual attraction towards that body.  This generally is around age 14-16 for girls and 16-18 for boys, although it can vary significantly.  Having sexual feelings for people of that age does not make one a pedophile, and is in fact quite normative from a biological standpoint.  What *does* make one a pedophile is sexual attraction towards pre-pubescent children whose bodies have not yet sexually developed.  That is an abnormal and pathological type of sexual attraction, and we consider people who experience that attraction to be pedophiles.

It's easy to conflate the illegality of engaging in sexual activity with a minor with pedophilia, but the two are not the same, as the age of consent in some places is higher than the age at which sexual maturity is reached.  Remember that the distinction between adult and child is something that varies significantly based on sociocultural values, and that this distinction has varied significantly even within single societies over time.  For example, it would have been quite normal for a 30-year-old male to have sex with a sexually mature 15-year-old female throughout much of European - and even American - history.  I point this out to emphasize that adult sexual attraction to post-pubescent adolescent bodies is biologically normative, and that its illegality in some societies does not change that fact.

Now, just because it's natural for an adult to feel sexual attraction towards a sexually mature 15-year-old doesn't mean that it's ok for that adult to have sex with such a person.  In making the determination of whether an adolescent is ready for sex, we consider other factors than sexual maturity, such as whether the individual is psychologically prepared for sex (and many/most 15-year-olds are not) in addition to the possibility for an imbalanced power dynamic.  So, although it may be completely natural and normative for an adult man to *want* to have sex with a sexually mature 15-year-old adolescent, it may also be illegal and immoral.  That person would not be a pedophile, even if they acted on the urges; in the latter case, they would just be a criminal.

I actually think that we need to do a better job educating people on this dynamic.  The problem with telling adults that sexual attraction towards *anyone* under the age of consent is abnormal and indicative of pedophilia is that adults who experience that attraction (as many of them do) then feel pressure to repress their feelings.  This leads to a dynamic in which the adult may experience shame which may, in turn, lead to the actual sexual behavior (something along the lines of ""if I'm a creepy pedophile because I find 15-year-olds attractive then screw it, I'll act like a pedophile).  Instead, we should be teaching that it's normal to feel attraction towards any sexually mature bodies, but that it's not ok to act on it for a number of reasons.",True,False,False,,0,1551458417,,1551458799,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehkbisv,False,t3_aw1esx,True,t3_aw1esx,/r/clinicalpsych/comments/aw1esx/a_question_for_psychologists_and_the_likes_what/ehkbisv/,False,,1555207469,2,True,False,clinicalpsych,t5_2snee,r/clinicalpsych,public,

Pack light with lots of space if you plan to shop, and, in the UK, get a 407 form when you buy stuff and keep your receipts  if you want a VAT (tax) refund (you can do this at the airport and it’s worth it if you buy a lot.) 

Travel wise, here’s my ten cents on the places you’re planning. I did an exchange semester in Germany and worked in Spain and I’ve been to most major Western European cities a few times because of that, but I’m definitely more “tourist” than “local” knowledge wise.

Museums in London are free and outstanding and that’s always what I do if I have a few days in London. My favourites are Victoria &amp; Albert, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Tate, but you can’t go wrong. There’s a million things to do there, of course, but I always just end up museum-ing (and wandering around the really posh neighbourhoods and the City). 

I looooove Berlin and imo to really appreciate it you should take a walking tour with a guide so you can hear all about the Cold War stuff. I am not usually into that kind of thing but I think it really helps understand the place. I had amazing luck vintage shopping in Berlin, which is also not something I usually do. It’s the coolest place and it has the weirdest bars I’ve ever been in, which are worth investigating even if you’re not out to party. 

Paris I’m not as ebullient about, but it’s very beautiful and I really like just walking around a ton and enjoying the architecture. Also window shopping on Rue St Honoré. It’s 100% worth going though. 

I’d suggest Amsterdam over Brussels if you want to see that region. I found Brussels kinda bleak and gray.

&gt;Liberal democracy is liberal, while Christian democracy is, by definition, not liberal: it is, if you like, illiberal. And we can specifically say this in connection with a few important issues – say, three great issues. Liberal democracy is in favour of **multiculturalism**, while Christian democracy gives priority to Christian culture; this is an illiberal concept. Liberal democracy is **pro-immigration** while Christian democracy is anti-immigration; this is again a genuinely illiberal concept. And liberal democracy sides with **adaptable family models**, while Christian democracy rests on the foundations of the Christian family model; once more, this is an illiberal concept.

In fact, Orban criticizes ""liberal democracy"" for restricting freedom of speech:
&gt;Working together, political leaders and technology giants filter news items that are uncomfortable for the liberal elite. If you don’t believe this, just visit these websites, visit social media sites, and you’ll see the ingenious and cunning means by which they restrict access to negative news reports on migrants, immigrants and related topics, and how they prevent European citizens from facing reality. The liberal concept of freedom of opinion has gone so far that liberals see diversity of opinion as important up until the point that they realise, to their shock, that there are opinions which are different from theirs.

I know for my part being in Scotland I'd cringe slightly if someone said they were Scottish too. Even though we're both from two of the most similar countries you can get the lifestyle and cultural differences between Scotland and America are so drastic I wouldn't be able to take such a claim seriously.

I think its a shame because I think some groups of Americans sell themselves short by trying to wholly claim being whatever type of European they are when the hybrid cultures they have made in America are fantastic and have many reasons of their own to be celebrated. 

But most importantly I think its the way its expressed that changes the reaction completely.

As crianças são MUITO criativas e, saca, eu aprendi na psicologia que a nossa criança ainda esta dentro de nós. Isso são os arquétipos. Então você precisa curar essa criança interior, dando as coisas que ela gosta, ela vai te dar a arte. Logicamente, essa criança precisa ""morrer"" para você ""renascer"", até porque você não é mais uma criança :P é triste, eu queria voltar a ser criança porque ia ser dahora não pensar em sexo.

Mas hoje vejo que criança pensa pra KRL sobre isso, então foda-se, tanto faz. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Outra coisa ruim que ninguém quer admitir no brasil. Enquanto nossas crianças dançam funk, crianças ricas tão desenhando.

É isso mesmo, se falar que venceu no jogo, mentiu. Até porque tem mais rico branco no Brasil né. E branco ouvindo funk vei, só por moda mesmo, pra beber e ficar pagando de gostoso.

Tanto faz para mim também.

Eu tento falar o que aprendi, que vender sexo, vender mulheres, vender o amor, é o que mais lucra.

Sim, resumi TODA a arte. Sim, arte, infelizmente, é o circo hoje em dia. O pão, mano, ta faltando, mas pelo menos todo mundo tem televisão hoje em dia.

É isso ai. 

Cristianismo, a porra da religião que mais domina, faz uma coisa interessantissima. Na eng. social dzem ""quer colocar algo no subconsciente de alguem? É só falar ""não"" e depois o comando"" É... dai você fala ""Não PENSE EM UM URSO AZUL"" é isso ai, logico, vai ser dificil porque você vai forçar sua imaginação até, hahahaha

Enfim, 10 mandamentos: ""Nao blablabal"" ""Nao seilablabal"" E todo mundo faz né? Sim, ""pecadores"" ou brinquedos controlados?

Jamessuperfun,1387747323.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_eh06a,False,"&gt; Norway is 0.1 aka 5 gun homicides a year over 5 million people. Thats such an infinitesimally small number that your probability of being a homicide by gun victim is basically zero.

But they're *not* zero, there is a consistent figure which allows the places to be compared in relative terms. The probability of being murdered is tiny in basically all of the first world, we are discussing cases per 100,000 population.

&gt; **You have interpreted this to mean that Hawaii is twice or three times as dangerous as Norway.** 

&gt; I have interpreted this to mean that **gun murders are basically nonexistent in both places so they are basically equally as safe.**

This 'interpretation' is objectively false. The best of your examples is triple Norway's and the pattern is consistent. Therefore, the correct statement is that the US is less safe from gun homicides than these places. You are also moving the goalposts; The vast majority of the US has dramatically more per capita gun homicides than Hawaii.

You're using some pretty ridiculous logic here to cover up the fact that not a single US state has such a small amount of gun violence. You've provided 3 examples (unsourced) with 3x, 6x and 8x as much gun murder as the countries you made the statements about. 

&gt; My statement still stands, that the places in the US without any black ghettos are just as safe from gun murders as any other European country. 

It doesn't stand, at all, because there are objectively more of them. Any European country wasn't even your claim, you claimed it specifically about two of the safest countries in the world.

SaliciousSeafoodSlut,1523307296.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1lc0uam,False,"I tend to disagree with the bit where you say it was unwise to kill Joffrey ASAP. There are some reasons that other Redditors have mentioned, but here's my take: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. To wait until after the bedding would mean that Margaery would no longer be a virgin. This would be a huge deal in securing a royal marriage. If we look at the example of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, it required a papal dispensation for them to marry, since she was married to (though allegedly not de-virginized by) Henry's older brother, Arthur. Otherwise it would have been considered incest- and indeed, Henry argued that it was, when he sought to dissolve the marriage. While the ASOIAF doesn't exactly follow the rules of medieval Europe, it's not a stretch to think that something similar could happen. For Margaery to lose her virginity to Joffrey would have jeopardized her betrothal to Tommen, which was the Tyrell's plan all along. Even if the betrothal to Tommen was still considered, there might have been a mandatory waiting period following Joffrey's death (like Jaime imposed on Jeyne Westerling, following Robb's death) to ensure that no children of Margaery's would have doubtful paternity. Which brings me to my second point...
2. Re: Joffrey dying following the wedding, and Margaery becoming pregnant: this supposes that a suitable biological father who could be trusted to stay silent could be found, AND that Margaery would become pregnant very quickly, which doesn't always happen. Even if she did become pregnant in that very narrow window, it's a huge risk for the Tyrells. For instance, what if the child is miscarried, or stillborn? Or what if it's a girl? Or dies young? Then Margaery loses all chance to become queen. Better to kill Joffrey and have Margaery remain a virgin, and then become pregnant by Tommen. (Admittedly, it would be better if Tommen could consummate the marriage immediately.)
3. And my final point, which is less pragmatic, but should be mentioned: Olenna seems to care about her granddaughter. Why subject her to Joffrey for any longer than she has to? She already knows that he's an abusive monster. May as well be rid of him, and set Margaery up with his gentle, malleable brother.

Ceredigion receives in average £57 million a year from the European Union funding commission.
[Source](https://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=111552&amp;headline=%C2%A357m%20a%20year%20benefit%20for%20county%20from%20EU%20membership&amp;sectionIs=News&amp;searchyear=2017)

The funding goes towards two key aspects of the Ceredigion economy - Education and Agriculture.
Agriculture is suffering in Ceredigion due to high costs, low revenues and the fact that most farmers are aging and being bought out.

Universities are running at a serious deficit Aberystwyth (ranked 351 in the top 400 worldwide)  operating with only 46% of its revenue coming from tuition fees (the rest being contracts and funding grants).

Tourism is another vital source of income for the area, and the EU has been involved in numerous restoration and accessibility projects to help preserve Ceredigion's history and heritage.

&gt; Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations).[14][35] Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Kurdish Jews were all very closely related to the populations of the Fertile Crescent, even closer than to Arabs.

&gt; A 2007 study by J. Feder et al.[62] confirmed the hypothesis of the founding of non-European origin among the maternal lines. Their study did not address the geographical origin of Ashkenazim and therefore does not explicitly confirm the origin ""Levantine"" of these founders. This study revealed a significant divergence in total haplogroup distribution between the Ashkenazi Jewish populations and their European host populations, namely Russians, Poles and Germans. They concluded that, regarding mtDNAs, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. The study also found that ""the differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons."" It supported previous interpretations that, in the direct maternal line, there was ""little or no gene flow from the local non-Jewish communities in Poland and Russia to the Jewish communities in these countries.""[63]

- The UK's place in NATO is drawn into question, the USA and France may question whether or not they can trust us and whether we can trust them. If we don't withdraw we'll see diplomatic repercussions, suspension from the G7 prehaps, harming British businesses.

- The UK withdraws from NATO. We can defend our country, but this would be a colossal blow to British soft power and will effectively end our reign as a Great Power. We may find ourselves voted off the UN Security Council, China and Russia don't want us there, what happens if we tell France and the US to fuck off?

- With NATO fragmented, Russia could seize the opportunity then there would be another migration crisis of desperate people fleeing across Europe, most of the EU would be at war with Russia which would disrupt UK-EU trade (which despite what this sub says we'll both rely on post-Brexit).

- Potentially WWIII if China and the USA are dragged into the conflict. The UK would definitely be in a EU-Russia war on the EU's side, as cunty as Brussels are any British government would like to give Putin a bloody nose.

If NATO goes then the post-war order is gone with it, who knows what countries will try to do to increase their influence in a post-Pax Americana world, not a box I want to open. I think it's safer to keep our many alliances, we have a good history of standing up for smaller countries who are threatened by larger ones led by pseudo-dictators, men didn't die in the fields of Belgium and France for the UK to withdraw from the world.

I can’t give you an exact source were source where it says what you ask for. The EU website for regulations and such. Is anything but user friendly, got frustrated very quickly.
What I found on my google search is the following...

Wikipedia and google say: 
Brussels has the “power” to announce non-binding recommendations for member countries. In this case everyone, with varying degree of severance did so. 
I believe that’s what I read in the newspaper back then.

public nudity fines usually are supported by disorderly conduct or obscenity laws and in some cases even labeled as a public order crime. 
Even tho it’s not explicitly stated that being “scandalously” clad is such a offense. which can get you up to a year in jail with no fine option. Though I imagine this to be a rare occasion.

&gt; Prosecutors have called for French far-right leader Marine Le Pen to be tried for tweeting pictures of atrocities committed by the Islamic State group, judicial sources said Friday.

&gt; Le Pen shared the images after a French journalist drew a comparison between the jihadist group and her party.

&gt; Le Pen, whose father Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the National Front party, since renamed National Rally, and other members of her party are also being probed in Brussels over allegations that they defrauded the European Union parliament out of 6.8 million euros in funding between 2009 and 2017.

And of course it comes back to history:

For more than a thousand years, Germans lived in ever increasingly indepedent principalities, dukedoms and (later) kingdoms that were (nominally) subserviant to the Holy Roman Emperor and later the German Confederation. The idea of a unified German nation with an accompanying identity arose comparatively late and lacking such a unified state, it was defined through a *common culture* and the *German language* especially.

That emphasis on culture hasn't really waned that much.

The situation is complicated by the fact, that for the longest time German citizenship exclusively followed the [""ius sanguinis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis), which in theory shouldn't be a problem for those American tourists of German ancestry. But a lot of ""(Spät-)Aussiedler"", citizens of the USSR who moved to Germany after the former's collapse since they were/are of German descent, faced rejection and even discrimination by autochthonous Germans. Thanks to the [repressions by the Soviet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Germans_in_Russia,_Ukraine_and_the_Soviet_Union#Decline_of_the_Russian_Germans) they were heavily assimilated and therefore perceived as Russians. Again, the common culture is the defining factor.

Even today the question of what makes a true German occasionally pops up. Either in relation to our biggest ethnic minority (Turkish immigrants - see [Gastarbeiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter) - and their descendants) or more recently to refugees. Conservative politicians will usually start talking about [""Leitkultur""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitkultur) in that context.

As you can see, a German national identity is a complicated thing and lacks a clear agreed-upon definition.

I understand that saying ""I'm X"" is usually undertstood to mean ""I have X ancestry"" in the US, but the same is just not true for Europe. Here it is understood as being immersed in the culture and being able to speak the language (or at least a bit of it).

Now, the annoyance you mentioned stems from the lack of understanding of traditions/habits/etc. which are seen as integral to the X identity.
An example: A young American woman with German ancestors which emigrated to the States in the 19th century dresses up in a Dirndl (though said ancestors hailed from Lower Saxony) to feel authentically German. She will be laughed at by Germans or even met with scorn, for Dirndls are a type of clothing mostly worn in some parts of Bavaria and even there mostly during a visit to the Oktoberfest.

p.s.: I omitted Nazi Germany and its concepts like the [""Volksdeutsche""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksdeutsche) - you will certainly understand how that time complicates things even further.",True,False,False,,0,1551470715,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehksyb1,False,t3_aw7swu,False,t3_aw7swu,/r/AskEurope/comments/aw7swu/european_travel_manners_talking_about_european/ehksyb1/,False,,1555252043,11,True,False,AskEurope,t5_2uayg,r/AskEurope,public,

No, your own people do that to themselves, and warhawks and israel firsters have made the West a part of your problem and vice versa.

Culture is downstream from race and science proves this.

**Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?**

""A study conducted by Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam suggests that diversity hurts civic life and that differences can actually translate into distrust. The political scientist and author explains his findings on the flip-side of cultural diversity.""

""The more diverse the group around us, ethnically, in our neighborhood, the less we trust anybody, including people who look like us. Whites trust whites less. Blacks trust blacks less, in more diverse settings.""

***

The downside of diversity

""Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam -- famous for ""Bowling Alone,"" his 2000 book on declining civic engagement -- has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.""

""The extent of the effect is shocking,"" says Scott Page, a University of Michigan political scientist.""

While Hitler did not feel powerful enough to arrest senior clergy before the end of the war, an estimated one third of German priests faced some form of reprisal from the Nazi government. Bishop von Preysing was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position, his cathedral administrator and confidant, Provost Bl. Bernard Lichtenberg, was not. A strong opponent of Nazism, Lichtenberg had been active with the Catholic Centre Party.[108] Lichtenberg served at St. Hedwig's Cathedral from 1932, and was under the watch of the Gestapo by 1933, for his courageous support of prisoners and Jews. He became a confidante of Bishop von Preysing from 1935.[108] He ran Preysing's aid unit (the Hilfswerke beim Bischöflichen Ordinariat Berlin) which secretly gave assistance to those who were being persecuted by the regime.[91] From the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938 onward, Lichtenberg closed each nightly service with a prayer for ""the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the concentration camps"", including ""my fellow priests there"".[91][109] Lichtenberg met his demise for protesting the Nazi policy regarding euthanasia directly to Dr. Conti, the Nazi State Medical Director. On 28 August 1941, he endorsed Galen's sermons in a letter to Conti, pointing to the German constitution which defined euthanasia as an act of murder.[110] On 23 October 1942, he offered a prayer for the Jews being deported to the East, telling his congregation to extend to the Jews the commandment of Christ to ""Love thy neighbour"".[109] For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, sentenced to two years' penal servitude, and died en route to Dachau Concentration Camp in 1943.[91] He was subsequently honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous among the Nations.[111]


The Blessed Rupert Mayer SJ was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1939.
The Blessed Rupert Mayer, a Bavarian Jesuit and World War I army chaplain, had clashed with the National Socialists as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler's rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to the Abbey of Ettal, but Myer died in 1945.[112][113]

Laurentius Siemer, Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, became a steadfast opponent of the Nazi regime and had contacts with the Resistance. The Gestapo arrested Siemer in Cologne in 1935, as part of the ""Currency Fraud Cases"" targeting Catholic clergy, and held him in custody for several months. He was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically. He spoke to resistance circles on the subject of Catholic social teaching as the starting point for the reconstruction of Germany, and worked with Carl Goerdeler and others in planning for a post-coup Germany. Following the failure of the July Plot, Siemer evaded capture and hid out until the end of the war.[114]


Fr. Otto Müller of the German Resistance, was arrested following the 1944 July Plot, and died in police custody.
Also involved in the German Resistance was Christian workers' movement activist and Centre Party politician Fr. Otto Müller. Müller was among those who argued for a firm line from the German bishops against legal violations of the Nazis. In contact with the German military opposition before the outbreak of war, he later allowed individual opposition figures the use of the Ketteler-Haus in Cologne for their discussions and was involved with Catholic politicians and July Plotters Jakob Kaiser, Nikolaus Groß and Bernhard Letterhaus in planning a post Nazi-Germany. After the failure of the July Plot, the Gestapo arrested Müller, who was imprisoned in the Berlin Police Hospital, where he died.[115]

Parish priests such as the Lübeck martyrs – Johannes Prassek, Eduard Müller and Hermann Lange, and the Lutheran pastor Karl Friedrich Stellbrink were partly inspired by August von Galen's anti-euthanasia homilies.[116][117][118] They shared disapproval of the Nazi regime, and the four priests spoke publicly against the Nazis – initially discreetly – distributing pamphlets to friends and congregants.[119] Although Church federation work with young people was banned, Müller worked with youth groups and led a discussion circle whose topics included National Socialism, political events and the military situation – using information from British radio and from leaflets including the sermons of Bishop Clemens August von Galen, which he duplicated with Lange and Prassek.[117][120] Then, following a March 1942 RAF raid, after which Stellbrink tended wounded, he delivered a Palm Sunday sermon which attributed the bombing to divine punishment. Stellbrink was arrested, followed by the three Catholic priests, and each was sentenced to death. Resigned to martyrdom, Prassek wrote to his family: ""Who can oppress one who dies"". The mingling of the blood of the four guillotined martyrs has become a symbol of German Ecumenism.[119]

Fr. Max Josef Metzger, a World War I military chaplain and holder of the Iron Cross, had founded the German Catholics' Peace Association in 1919 and sought links to the international pacifist movement. As a leading German pacifist, he was targeted by the Nazi authorities and arrested on several occasions by the Gestapo. He was arrested for the last time in June 1943 after being denounced by a mail courier for attempting to send a memorandum on the reorganisation of the German state and its integration into a future system of world peace to Erling Eidem, the Swedish Archbishop of Uppsala. Sentenced to death, he was executed on 17 April 1944.[121]

An old guard of national-conservatives aligned to Carl Friedrich Goerdeler broke with Hitler in the mid-1930s. According to Kershaw, they ""despised the barbarism of the Nazi regime. But were keen to re-establish Germany's status as a major power ..."". Essentially authoritarian, they favoured monarchy and limited electoral rights ""resting on Christian family values"".[122] ""Hitlerism is poison for the German soul"", wrote Goerdeler, ""Hitler is determined to destroy Christianity"".[123]


Augustin Rösch (centre) was the wartime Jesuit Provincial of Bavaria and one of three Jesuits in the inner Kreisau Circle of the German Resistance.
A younger group, dubbed the ""Kreisau Circle"" by the Gestapo, did not look to German imperialism for inspiration.[122] Religious motivations were particularly strong in the Kreisau Circle of the Resistance.[124] Formed in 1937, though multi-denominational, it had a strongly Christian orientation, and looked for a general Christian revival, and reawakening of awareness of the transcendental. Its outlook was rooted both in German romantic and idealist tradition and in the Catholic doctrine of natural law.[125] The Circle looked to a federalised Europe along the lines of the United States as the desirable ""new order"", resting heavily on German Christian and social ideals, with self-governing communities rooted in social justice. The Circle pressed for a coup against Hitler, but being unarmed was dependent on persuading military figures to take action.[122]

Among the central membership of the Circle were the Jesuit Fathers Augustin Rösch, Alfred Delp and Lothar König.[126] Bishop von Preysing had contact with the group.[127] The Catholic conservative Karl Ludwig von Guttenberg brought the Jesuit Provincial of Southern Germany Augustin Rösch into the Kreisau Circle, along with Alfred Delp. For figures like Rösch, the Catholic trade unionists Jakob Kaiser and Bernhard Letterhaus and the July Plot leader Klaus von Stauffenberg, ""religious motives and the determination to resist would seem to have developed hand in hand"".[55]


The Jesuit Alfred Delp was an influential member of the Kreisau Circle – one of the few clandestine German Resistance groups operating inside Nazi Germany. He was executed in February 1945.[128]
According to Gill, ""Delp's role was to sound out for Moltke the possibilities in the Catholic Community of support for a new, post-war Germany"".[129] Rösch and Delp also explored the possibilities for common ground between Christian and socialist trade unions.[129] Lothar König SJ became an important intermediary between the Circle and bishops Grober of Freiberg and Presying of Berlin.[130]

The Kreisau group combined conservative notions of reform with socialist strains of thought – a symbiosis expressed by Delp's notion of ""personal socialism"".[131] The group rejected Western models, but wanted to ""associate conservative and socialist values, aristocracy and workers, in a new democratic synthesis which would include the churches.""[131] Delp wrote: ""It is time the 20th Century revolution was given a definitive theme, and the opportunity to create new and lasting horizons for humanity"", by which he meant, social security and the basics for individual intellectual and religious development. So long as people lacked dignity, they would be incapable of prayer or thought.[132] In Die dritte Idee (The Third Idea), Delp expounded on the notion of a third way, which, as opposed to Communism and Capitalism, might restore the unity of the person and society.[133]

Another non-military German Resistance group, dubbed the ""Frau Solf Tea Party"" by Gestapo, included the Jesuit Fr Friedrich Erxleben.[134] The purpose of the Solf Circle was to seek out humanitarian ways of countering the Nazi regime. It met at either Frau Solf or Elizabeth von Thadden's home. Von Thadden was a Christian educational reformer and Red Cross worker.[135] Otto Kiep and most of the group were arrested in 1941 and executed.[134][136]

As the recently elected member of Cornwall and Devon, I have the pleasure of answering questions and concerns from the Right Honourable Gentleman, u/throwawayravenclaw.


Mr Deputy Speaker the ideals of Unionism has been core ideal of mine, and my party’s for a long time. It’s quite simple really, our union increases not only the economic prosperity of all of us, but it helps us to defend our nation, to grow our soft power, and put Britain on the world stage.


I raise today to defend our union, a virtue and value my party guarantees. My party and I are proud unionists and I again echo the sentiments around this house that: I believe we can achieve far more together than we ever could apart.


I will echo the voice of my friends, and other honourable members of this house: All four constituent nations of our kingdom, England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, are beneficiaries from the participation in our kingdom.

I have purposefully excluded Cornwall, and for a reason.


While my party will always respect the regional differences, language, and traditions. We will continue to respect the Cornish people and their culture.


But on the issue of Cornish Nationalism. I hold a strong stance. Cornwall is not a country.


The Stannary laws that governs Cornwall is governs tin mining in Devon and Cornwall which no longer of much practical relevance. The Convocation which the Rt Hon. Gentlemen brought up sat for the last time in 1748.

signatures to raise the issue of the ""Cornish Identity"" in Parliament""This petition has now closed, it received 851 signatures, (99,149 less than the 100,000 needed for the matter to be considered for debate in the House of Commons.)


The Right Honourable Gentle claims to want Cornish Devolution. Is he aware that the Cornish Council, established in 2009,has given a choice and voice to those within Cornwall? Is he aware that Mebyon Kernow, the only nationalist Cornish party within the Council, has only 4 seats within? In comparison to the 119 Pro-Unionist councillors, can we not say that the issue of Nationalism is a small issue to the
cornish people? If the issue is of such wide support as the Right Honourable gentleman claims, shouldn’t that view be reflected within the council of Cornish people? In the 2009 European election, the Pro-Nationalist party of Mebyon Kernow, only received 14,922 votes?
This just goes to further prove that the problem is not popular amongst the Cornish people, who as a part of the southwest, sent 6 pro-unionist MEPs to the EU.


Mr.Deputy Speaker It is clear to me and others in this house, that the matter of Cornish Nationalism is not a popular issue amongst the Cornish as the right honourable gentleman claims it to me. Therefore I

&gt; # [Las jugadas de Maduro con Rusia para la supervivencia del régimen](https://www.eltiempo.com/mundo/venezuela/image/jpeg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;   Maduro ordenó pasar la oficina central de PDVSA a Moscú y recibirá ayuda humanitaria rusa.
&gt; 
&gt;   Delcy Rodríguez, vicepresidenta de Venezuela, durante su encuentro con el canciller ruso, Sergio Lavrov.
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;  01 de marzo 2019 , 12:42 p.m.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Tras la asfixia diplomática en la cual se encuentra el régimen de Venezuela por la aplicación de múltiples sanciones estadounidenses, y los diferentes mecanismos de presión del Grupo de Lima y de la Unión Europea, **su vicepresidenta, Delcy Rodriguez, viajó a Moscú para socavar apoyos que le permitan la supervivencia en el poder.**
&gt; 
&gt; Junto a uno de sus más grandes aliados, como lo es Rusia, Venezuela aceptó la ayuda humanitaria que el gobierno de Putin enviará a Caracas. También anunció el traslado de la oficina de la petrolera estatal Pdvsa de Lisboa a Moscú, con el fin de garantizar la seguridad de los activos del país.
&gt; 
&gt; En materia humanitaria, Rodríguez insiste en negar que Venezuela sufra una crisis y aseguró que países como Colombia o Paraguay son mucho más pobres, aunque informó que Caracas está ""en proceso de trabajo"" **con las agencias de cooperación de la ONU para ""recibir asistencia técnico-humanitaria"" de países como ""la hermana**   
&gt; **Rusia"", pero ""nunca"" de aquellos que ""realizaron acciones unilaterales, arbitrarias e ilegales contra Venezuela"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Lavrov aseguró que Rusia envió ""un primer lote de 7,5 toneladas de medicamentos"" con destino a Venezuela. ""Hemos recibido una lista suplementaria de medicamentos que el gobierno venezolano desearía obtener. **Estamos examinándola, aclarando los detalles y verificando los detalles logísticos"", agregó el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores.**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Estas son las imágenes que ⁦[@jorgeramosnews](https://twitter.com/jorgeramosnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)⁩ le mostró a Nicolás Maduro y que provocaron que Maduro se levantara de la entrevista,⁩ que retuvieran al equipo de Univision y que confiscaran su trabajo. Esto es lo que Maduro no quiere que vea el mundo. [https://twitter.com/Enrique\_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472/video/1](https://twitter.com/Enrique_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472/video/1)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; — Enrique Acevedo (@Enrique\_Acevedo) [26 de febrero de 2019](https://twitter.com/Enrique_Acevedo/status/1100223925684969472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Rodríguez destacó que Maduro ha dado ""instrucciones muy claras"" para que los alimentos y medicamentos que el país necesita ""sean adquiridos"" en   
&gt; Rusia, a lo que hay que sumar la producción ""conjunta"" de productos básicos en territorio venezolano. **También recordó que Venezuela ha informado al Grupo de Contacto de la Unión Europea de que está dispuesta a pagar alimentos y medicinas por valor de ""casi dos mil millones de dólares"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Sobre la posible intervención militar de EE. UU.
&gt; 
&gt; **""Europa no da garantías de respeto a nuestros activos"", dijo Rodríguez durante una rueda de prensa conjunta con su homólogo ruso, Serguéi Lavrov, en Moscú.** La vicepresidenta aseguró que los países capitalistas están violando sus propias leyes al congelar los bienes de Venezuela en bancos occidentales y tachó de un ""robo a mano armada"" lo que se está haciendo en la actualidad con los recursos financieros de Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; Al respecto, acusó a los ""intolerantes"" países occidentales de violar sus propias leyes ""capitalistas"" y consideró que el ""momento era oportuno"" para dicha decisión, dada la creciente cooperación con los mayores consorcios rusos: la petrolera Rosneft y la gasística Gazprom.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  Tomas aéreas difundidas en redes sociales muestran al segundo vehículo de la caravana en medio de las llamas, justo antes de llegar al bloqueo de las fuerzas del régimen de Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; **De esta manera, Rodríguez busca recabar el apoyo político, comercial y humanitario de Rusia para garantizar la supervivencia del régimen del presidente Nicolás Maduro, al tiempo que descartó la posibilidad de que prospere una intervención militar estadounidense.** ""Venezuela no necesita una intervención militar. Nuestro continente no necesita una intervención militar, ni de Estados Unidos ni de nadie. Necesitamos paz, estabilidad y tranquilidad"", aseguró.
&gt; 
&gt; De esta manera, la vicepresidenta desveló que había intercambiado con Lavrov ""información relevante"" sobre una posible intervención estadounidense y aseguró que dichos planes ""no son nuevos"" y recuerdan a Siria, donde el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, evitó el derrocamiento del presidente Bachar al Asad por parte de Washington.
&gt; 
&gt; **""Sabemos que hay toda una maniobra que pretende justificar la intervención internacional. Eso no ocurrirá en Venezuela""**, afirmó y acusó al enviado especial de EE. UU. para Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, de tener experiencia en ""actividades subversivas"" y de buscar desestabilizar el país con la creación de ""grupos irregulares"".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; También se discutió el futuro de Guaidó
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  El presidente de Brasil Jair Bolsonao (i) saluda al jefe de la Asamblea Nacional, Juan Gauidó, durante un pronunciamiento conjunto tras una reunión privada en Brasilia.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto al retorno de Guaidó a Venezuela, que podría producirse el lunes 4 de marzo (si no acepta la invitación que el hizo el presidente de Ecuador, Lenín Moreno, para visitarlo en Quito), Rodríguez aseguró que se trata de ""un señor que de repente un día se fue a una plaza pública y se autoproclamó presidente por el simple hecho de contar con el apoyo del Gobierno de EE. UU."", lo que calificó de ""atentado"" contra el orden constitucional.
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Pero, peor aún, es un señor que colabora con gobiernos extranjeros para atentar contra el estado de derecho. Y en Venezuela existe un estado de derecho consolidado y vigoroso como su democracia que cuenta con los mecanismos de defensa de su propia constitucionalidad"", señaló.
&gt; 
&gt; **Consideró que Venezuela tiene una oposición ""incompetente de ganarse el amor de los venezolanos a través de los votos y busca desesperadamente, pide a gritos una intervención militar como única forma de llegar al poder"".**
&gt; 
&gt; Y recordó que Maduro apoya el diálogo con la oposición en el marco de los mecanismos de Montevideo, motivo por el que Lavrov destacó la postura ""constructiva"" del líder venezolano, frente a la ""destructiva"" de Guaidó.

Kh_0502,1499072824.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_5vx9yff,False,"I took a two week break as well. I got back with a better mindset and improved way more than before since I started to become bored. To improve again you can make a schedule. I dont know how much time you have on weekdays or weekends or how competitive you are but this worked for me.

Firstly check if you’re keybinds are still good and if your comfortable with your set up (enough space for mouse etc) try to find someone who can teach you some new tricks and inform you about the meta.  (if you are on europe send a pm, I might help you a bit) 

30 min kovaaks (do more tracking than flicks, since you use tracking 90% of the time, I recommend doing ascended tracking v2 for 15 min, tile frenzy 180 for 7.5 min and something of your liking. Make sure you use your exact fortnite sensitivity ( [good introduction video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0X--vk5N_0Y) )

15 min edit courses (difficult as possible try to implement edits you couldnt do before, dont get in the comfort zone. If you can do floor pyramid edit on each ramp running, you turn it into edit pyramid as a ramp and then floor pyramid edit for example.) I would recommend making your own edit course with edits that you want to work on.  In my edit course I have a few “awkward” edits. I don’t have a video, but it is basically a wall-&gt;boostpad-&gt;wall, so that you get boosted into the wall.

15 min building (dont do only 90’s, mix everything you do ingame; turtling variations, side jumps etc.) 

If you have enough time you can do some 1v1s or turtle fights, especially turtle fights, they helped me a lot. Look for a creative server that organises this multiple times a day. If you are doing 1v1s dont do it always with the same person, since you will get used to their playstyle. You can find an opponent in a few min at discord servers or lfg like on fortnitetracker. You can do this as long as you like. For good inspiration and tricks look at some videos of [Riley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VgU5JvkKJjy4neRuHQdtQ) watch his buildfight compilations in slomo. 

If you want to play pubs, then you are probably more than ready now, but you could always do a game of team rumble and try to get a 30 bomb for aim practice. If your goal is scrimming, do 30 min of hotdropping in pubs to finish the warm up. 

After your games take 10 minutes each day to re-watch a scrim match where you got into late-game but didnt win and what you could improve. Look at rotations, how you died, where you took unnecessary damage, if you didn’t have enough mats etc.

Mentality is also really important, never try to blame the game. There is almost always a way that you could’ve avoided that mistake. If you blame the game, you miss out on a opportunity to learn from your mistake. 

After each pub/scrim write down how you died/what your mistake was. If you can find what the problem is (missing shots, stress, cannot get the highground, messing up an edit, not utilising right hand peek etc.) then you can focus on that more on your next day.

CJohn89,1527115715.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_900xn0n,False,"&gt;Lol your pro american bias clouds your judgement. Again

But I have no pro America bias. It is one of my favorite topics to lampoon. It only appears favourable in comparsion to the evil slave caliphate built by the South which the US went a long way in redemption by dedeating.

Your pro slavery caliphate bias is the issue here.

I have presented evidence and you have not.

&gt; you arent considering the personal motivations of the southerners who were fighting for their country

Southerners were fighting against their Country. Their country was the USA and they explicitly collectively declared they'd rather be a slave Nation than loyal to an egalitarian Nation.

The only exception of all the diary entries I have read is this one from a confederate Soldier

&gt;""...the North is relentless and savage in their aggression. We have requested time to bury the dead which pile high. My brother, O dear brother was given to God Monday and his body still lays were it fell. I wish for peace, I wish and pray for our dignity  as Sons of Adam to return. I would never allow the poor treatment of another Negro if it means Lincoln calls his dogs off my land and allows me to earn my living as a free man.
   --Hamish Lancaster, 1862 ""Journal of a Southern Freeman"" (Published 1953)

Even though one example against doesn't doesn't coint for much to an intelligent person. There's an even more obvious reason why that doesn't count.

&gt;I suggest you consider this qoute from Lincoln

Three times I have responded to that quote in detail. Of the seven times you have quoted it nothing in ut has changed.

Maybe next time you can use the full quote though



&gt;this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. *I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong, having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary*, **but I hold that notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.** I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. **I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects---certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man. **

This is your *only* example of anything (which does nothing to support your actual point that the South seceded for than slavery) and the full context and content contradicts you.

It contradicts you so much that you end thebquote mid sentence.

See how badly you fail?

Everything you said has been wrong

-I have no Nationalist sentiment or Pro-Armerica bias. I am not even a US citizen

-Europe didn't replace slavery with serfdom. Serfdom is medieval and slavery was *the last practised form of serfdom in Europe*, moron.

-There are no surveys or correspondence, not one, that has has confederates giving their reasons for fighting or secession anything other than slavery and their determination for their slave caliphate to exist kept them fighting.

You know this and cant contradict it.

-Lincoln was a staunch abolitionist and believed in the equality of black people in all Natural rights. This was not racist enough for the South and so he made a statement during a debatr, part if this was his expressing a racist view that he did not extent this view to social and political equality.

You're quoting Lincoln qualifying his egalitarian views with an appeal to the racist scumbag confederate audience present and it ultimately failed.",True,False,False,,0,1551473638,,1551475160,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehkx9fo,True,t3_au2pb1,True,t1_ehkp1ny,/r/HistoryMemes/comments/au2pb1/one_more/ehkx9fo/,False,,1555254070,1,True,False,HistoryMemes,t5_2v2cd,r/HistoryMemes,public,

1. It doesn't list any type of timeframe for the white slaves, their conditions, or the length of their slavery. Slavery is often only discussed in the American context, but it doesn't behave the same everywhere. For example, Salves in the Ottoman empire could become government officials, obtain prestigious positions, or gain freedom in ways that was never really possible for in American slavery. And, this is speculation, but the fact that they could become officials implies that they also might have had better access to things like education. 

2. Black slaves went to the Caribbeans, Central America, and South America in greater numbers than they came to the US or 13 colonies. Saying there were more whites than blacks in the slave trade is *way* different than saying more whites were brought to North Africa than to the 13 colonies because those brought to the 13 colonies are a small fraction of the total amount in the slave trade. Slaves were brought to Europe, all of North America (not just 13 colonies), the Caribbean, and in greatest numbers to South America. So it sounds like he's comparing a fraction of one slave trade to the whole of another. If so, for what reason? 

I'm not the guy you've been talking about this with, but I don't think this quote is used in good faith, if its even accurate at all.

The US used NY and Swift since Bill Clinton as a weapon in faster succession. Since this is a sword of Damocles over China and Russia it is just a logical step to develop an alternative.  The expression America First has become  now a threat especially since informal and formal agreements with the US are worthless. The world of finance has become a stage for war. But as in every modern war weapons are becoming faster outdated than anticipated and the risk to become a victim is too high. China is able to build and maintain  the infrastructure for Brics.  China is for Asia the key for international trade which will pump money into this system. The EU is thinking about a similar policy but not that noisy. 

I'm considering the usage of tariffs and denying to be able to pay as a huge strategic mistake. First it hit only smaller countries like Serbia to be extended later to Africa only to hit Russia later. The paranoid perception of China as a hostile power accelerated the thinking about alternatives and controlling the payment channels gives access to cheap money.  When the EU became a target because of JPCOA from president and congress it was IMHO not to avoid to perceive the actions as a huge warning light.

Even our basketball, soccer and rugby league domestic leagues have a team from NZ competing in them.

American basketball (and to some extent football) as well as European (mainly English) soccer is pretty big here.

&gt; &amp;quot;We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU,&amp;quot; Michel Barnier said in an interview with Germany&amp;#039;s Die Welt newspaper to be published on Saturday.

&gt; Barnier said EU guarantees that the backstop is temporary could come as part of the political agreement setting out expectations for Britain&amp;#039;s relationship with the bloc after it leaves.

kyrvyl,1538898323.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2d47i5t8,False,"&gt;Me: Fleeing a terrible situation

&gt;You: organized plan to take over Europe

For one, why can't it be both? I mean ISIS and others have said that is what they are trying to do.

Do you seriously think it can only be one or the other? That people in power wouldn't see fit to capitalize on a situation?

This is the exact thing with immigration in America. Yes, people are looking for a better life. But the situation sure as hell would be different if they voted Republican. Sort of like how neither the US or Europe has any interest in bringing in Boer refugees, yet we're perfectly happy bringing in Guatemalans for some reason despite being in a less dangerous situation. If it was truly only about helping people, it simply doesn't add up. 

The problem with the ""fleeing a terrible situation"" thing is severalfold. 

For one, like I said, it's much cheaper to relocate people to safe zones in the middle east. It's over 10 times cheaper. If you want to help the most people, that's obviously the best way to do it. Bringing them across the ocean makes no sense. 

Two, the majority of ""refugees"" are military age males. It's so dangerous they have to leave their women and children behind? And very many of them are not from active warzones, perhaps the majority, merely from shitty countries looking to make money.

So why do they have to come to Europe? And in Europe, why Norway and Germany? Places like Italy and Greece are much cheaper. Yet they all try to get through those to the countries with the highest welfare.

And this ignores the entire immigration component - refugees are only one component of the mass importation of Muslims. Many are simply normal immigrants.

So all this adds up to not make much sense. Yes, there are some people fleeing bad situations. There are also very many people capitalizing on the opportunity to present themselves that way. And all in all, it makes no sense why they all have to go to Europe.

Rape Jihad is the millions of native women these migrants have sexually assaulted.

In short, it makes no sense to bring millions of these people to Europe, the supposed justifications are rather flimsy, and the consequences have been severe. If the intention were not to oppress and destroy the local populations, that sure seems like the intended effect. While meanwhile lots of the same people advocating for helping these poor refugees are at the same time demanding more military intervention in the middle east...

I don't like it for all the reasons you stated.

Suddenly, all my YouTube activity going back to the early 2000's had my full name plastered on it!!! And I couldn't take it off! I was very careful with Facebook comments, because I was conscious from the beginning that my name was attached, but I couldn't say the same about YouTube from 2005!!!! Fuck!!!!

I tried everything to untangle those accounts or take my name off. I couldn't.  I wrote a  nasty, angry email to Google and deleted my YouTube account. 

At some point I got it back and it doesn't have my name on it.

I actually don't think I wrote anything THAT BAD on there, but it was when I was becoming conscious of ""E footprint"" and it was making me infuriated and upset that Google want allowing me to control that. It felt like an absolute invasion, and violation, back stamping my internet activity with my full name and not allowing me to control it. 

Especially with my name!!!! It's only me. It's no one else. And it feels very violating for just anyone to be able to Google me and trawl through years of my online activity...

It's been several years since I even use my real name on Facebook even.

ninja1635,1398368472.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_gacnp,False,"""The people"". I don't have good memories of ~~Venice~~ FLORENCE. The city was beautiful and was neat to see it outside of a game... BUT there were waaaay too many people when I was there (random ordinary day, no celebrations).

It was almost impossible to walk around the city without bumping into someone every few seconds. Crowded like an ant nest. Very unpleasant tourist experience. Was difficult to find anywhere to sit down and nearly all restaurants were full.

Was able to get a table at a nice restaurant with my ex. The menu was in Italian language with very bad and vague English translations. I ordered a beef dish which was 15€, but after I ate it and got a receipt, I noticed they charged me 25€ for it. I then went to check the menu and noticed that they didn't bring me the right dish, but a dish that was right above the one I ordered (also a beef dish, so it was practically impossible to notice the dish wasn't correct). Couldn't do anything about it because I already finished the meal and they spoke English worse than elementary school children in my country. Although the food was good, I couldn't help but to feel cheated. Either it was an honest mistake or intentional to dry my wallet (leaning more towards that).

And back to the topic of poor English... People in Italy are like from a different planet in which no other language exists. Extremely self centered nation. Was difficult to communicate with any public workers and information desks (like wtf, why are people who don't know English on information desks?!). 

Also had problems with my Airbnb hosts because of that. Our flight (to Rome) was delayed for 2 hours, I called the host when we arrived and he was completely pissed and didn't understand more than half of the things I said. He literally left us roofless at sometime after 19:00 during a weekend. Luckily I got into contact with Airbnb support and they got us a place but I was still extremely pissed at that host, you can't just dump someone in the middle of a foreign city because their flight was delayed for 2 hours - and then yell at them ""IT YOR PROBLM, NO MINE"" when asked where will we sleep.

Then I had another problem with a host in Florence (but not as negative as the above), who almost completely couldn't speak English. The listed address wasn't correct and it was a huge hassle to find the apartment.

Anyways, those were just my experiences, I'm sure many people don't find themselves in such situations. Although I just mentioned some bad stuff there was also a lot of good stuff, but I still feel like Italy was the least tourist friendly country I visited in Europe. I don't get it when people keep complimenting Italy as being super hospitable. Even Serbia was much friendlier, hospitable and English capable + hella cheaper.

Bawstahn123,1452655255.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_tqp33,False,"In Britannia, most people live in the countryside, where they work the land for themselves and their noble landlords. These tenant farmers are known as ""coloni"", and while they are free, they do owe their landlord a debt ala sharecropping for the use of their fields, plows, ox-teams, etc.

There is a particular subclass of these colonates called ""adscripticii"", who are bound to their landlords estates due to outstanding debts, prohibited from leaving the boundaries of their landlords latifundum without permission under a system of fines, imprisonment or physical beatings. 

While the above doesnt sound pleasant, it must be noted that one does not come to be a colonus adscriptus without first signing a contract, so you cant (technically) be made an adscripticii against your will. And in return for your labor and portion of the crops, the adscripticii is no longer required to pay taxes as a freeman would, the landlord is legally obligated to feed and provide tools to the tenant while they labored, and the debt of the tenant would be wiped away.

So, while giving up your freedom and that of your family might be not an optimal outcome, it is actually relatively common, and many peasant families enter the contract willingly in order to wipe away debt, which as the climate across Europe is deteriorating and farmers are seeing declining or even failing crop yields, might be the best of a slew of poor choices.

So, a colonus adcripticii is not allowed to leave their landlords estate without permission, which is usually only granted for market-days held once a week in most civitates. Free coloni, on the other hand, can do what they want and go where they want.

  *Boa leitura!* 

  O ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [obteve autorização da Justiça](justica-autoriza-lula-deixar-pf-para-acompanhar-velorio-de-neto-em-sp-23492526) para deixar a carceragem da Polícia Federal, em Curitiba, e ir ao velório do neto Arthur Araújo Lula da Silva, de 7 anos, em São Bernardo do Campo (SP). O menino morreu [vítima de meningite meningocócica](https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/ancelmo/post/neto-do-ex-presidente-lula-morre-de-meningite-meningococica-em-sao-paulo.html) , horas depois de dar entrada no hospital com febre alta, informa Ancelmo Gois. 

  **Detalhes:** Lula [recebeu a notícia](chefe-da-custodia-da-pf-leva-lula-noticia-sobre-morte-de-seu-neto-23491954) do chefe da custódia da PF na capital paranaense, Jorge Chastallo Filho. Arthur era o quinto dos seis netos do petista. O corpo do menino será cremado às 12h de sábado. 

  Contexto: no fim de janeiro, a Justiça Federal proibiu a ida de Lula ao velório do irmão Genival Inácio da Silva, o Vavá. A defesa recorreu ao Supremo Tribunal Federal, mas a autorização foi concedida minutos antes do enterro, e o ex-presidente permaneceu em Curitiba. 

  Agora, a PF e a força-tarefa da Lava-Jato [concordaram com a saída temporária](justica-autoriza-lula-deixar-pf-para-acompanhar-velorio-de-neto-em-sp-23492526) . O governo do Paraná disponibilizou um avião para transportá-lo. 

  Autoridades se mobilizaram para evitar a interdição do Sambódromo do Rio. Após vistoriar o local, o Corpo de Bombeiros [emitiu laudo informando que não se opõe à realização dos desfiles](/rio/bombeiros-nao-se-opoem-aos-desfiles-na-sapucai-judiciario-decidira-sobre-liberacao-1-23491106) de escolas de samba, mas indicou pendências de documentação. Horas depois, a Riotur afirmou ter cumprido as [18 exigências emergenciais](/rio/riotur-afirma-ter-cumprido-18-exigencias-do-corpo-de-bombeiros-no-sambodromo-23492884) e decidiu, junto com a Liesa, a liga das agremiações, [assinar o termo de responsabilidade exigido pela Justiça para liberar o evento](/rio/sambodromo-riotur-liesa-irao-assinar-corresponsabilidade-documentos-ainda-precisam-ser-entregues-justica-23492503) . 

  **Últimos acontecimentos:** três horas antes do início dos desfiles, previstos para às 22h30m, a Justiça ainda não havia liberado o Sambódromo. Mesmo assim, [os portões estavam aberto, e o público já ocupava a arquibancada](/rio/ainda-sem-autorizacao-da-justica-sambodromo-abre-ao-publico-para-primeiro-dia-de-desfiles-23493404) .

  **Outro caso: ** também em cima da hora, o bloco Carmelitas conseguiu autorização para desfilar e levou dezenas de foliões às ruas de Santa Teresa. [Músicas e fantasias expressaram críticas](/rio/carmelitas-desfila-em-santa-teresa-com-criticas-vale-mais-laranjas-lembranca-jean-wyllys-23492224) ao governo, à mineradora Vale e ao caso Fabrício Queiroz.

  **Restrições ao ministro:** ao intervir para derrubar a indicação da cientista política Ilona Szabó para conselho sobre política criminal, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro [quebrou uma promessa feita a Sergio Moro.](bolsonaro-quebra-promessa-feita-moro-de-dar-liberdade-total-para-nomeacoes-na-justica-23490829) 

  **A versão de Queiroz:** Fabrício Queiroz disse ao Ministério Público, em depoimento por escrito, que [“gerenciava” valores recebidos por servidores do gabinete](queiroz-diz-ao-mp-que-usava-salarios-para-multiplicar-base-eleitoral-de-flavio-bolsonaro-23490787) de Flávio Bolsonaro para expandir a rede de colaboradores do parlamentar, sem informá-lo. A Alerj disse que a prática não é permitida. 

  **Cor, olhos e cabelo:** uma decisão judicial de 2016 está provocando polêmica nas redes sociais. Na sentença, a juíza Lissandra Reis Ceccon, da 5ª Vara Criminal de Campinas, [descreve características do homem](/sociedade/reu-nao-possui-estereotipo-padrao-de-bandido-diz-juiza-em-condenacao-por-latrocinio-23492053) que acabou condenado por latrocínio: “não possui estereótipo de bandido”. 

  **Acusação de estupro:** uma turista baiana de 24 anos disse que foi [assediada e estuprada por cinco bombeiros](/rio/mulher-muda-versao-em-depoimento-nega-estupro-por-bombeiros-diz-delegada-23492970) no Posto 2 da orla, em Copacabana, na manhã desta sexta-feira.

Considerou que filhos de militares foram privilegiados porque tiveram acesso anterior a 21 das 50 questões. 

  **Festa na Câmara: ** às vésperas do carnaval, vereadores de Niterói aprovaram, por unanimidade, [aumento de 50% em seus próprios salários](/rio/bairros/vereadores-de-niteroi-aprovam-aumento-de-50-em-seus-proprios-salarios-23491927) . 

  **Repasse a petista:** a delação de ex-executivos da OAS inclui relato sobre pagamento de cerca de [R$ 1 milhão ao ex-ministro José Dirceu](delatores-da-oas-relatam-repasses-de-1-milhao-jose-dirceu-23491951) . 

  **Perdas recentes: ** o empresário Jorge Paulo Lemann deixou o posto de homem mais rico do Brasil depois que perdeu US$ 4,4 bilhões — agora, sua fortuna é de US$ 23 bilhões. [Confira o ranking atualizado](/economia/jorge-paulo-lemann-perde-posto-de-homem-mais-rico-do-brasil-23491396) . 

  **Do lado de cá...:** após receber Juan Guaidó em Brasília, o chanceler Ernesto Araújo articula no Grupo de Lima iniciativa para [convencer China e Rússia](/mundo/brasil-esta-disposto-ajudar-china-russia-entenderem-situacao-da-venezuela-diz-chanceler-23491792) de que o governo de Nicolás Maduro na Venezuela é “ilegítimo”. 

  **...e do lado de lá:** Maduro reforça laços com os russos. Ele ordenou a [transferência do escritório europeu da PDVSA](/mundo/maduro-ordena-transferencia-de-escritorio-europeu-da-pdvsa-para-moscou-23490762) , a petroleira venezuelana, para Moscou.

No it doesn’t. It means they have somewhere to live without the threat of being thrown to the street it doesn’t have to be a mansion it has to be secure housing. 

&gt; A new car? and old car? any car that moves without a tow truck? A Mercedes? a Toyota? literally the cheapest one on craigslist?

Anything that could provide the means to maintain their employment? Would you allow that or not bootstraps enough for you? A car? Possibly. But public transport is probably more important. Secure that. Make it cheaper and convenient. You knows amazing about good public transport. It pays for itself! 

&gt; Any entertainment? A tv? Cable, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Youtube premium, spotify, pandora and siriusXM subscriptions? Or just a radio?

Entertainment is the classic go to. Yeah it may not be a necessity but we’ll how long you can go without being depressed or beaten when you lose your entertainment. Because these people don’t actually have be free time to socialise generally. Because they’re working two jobs. 

&gt; Eating out twice a week? once a month? never?

Eating out? Maybe not. But eating. I can’t believe this is even in the cards as a nonessential. Also you can live without eating out. That’s not in contention. You’re making an issue out of nothing here. 

&gt; Any vacations? one a year? three a year? to Europe or a state park?
 
Going abroad isn’t possible clearly but vacation time should be guaranteed even if it’s staying home for a week not driving their car they’re not allowed to own or watching the Netflix they shouldn’t have or going out for a meal they can’t have...

Quality of life cannot be quantified you’re right. But human decency can be respected and professional dignity should be a right. Quality of life is the basic needs of all people and something the “RICHEST NATION ON EARTH” should be able to grant without a problem. Your own nation has in its mantra “in the pursuit if happiness” you’re not willing to grant that.

This means May's deal would need approximately **80** Labour defectors to pass.  It will never achieve nearly that number.  Any Labour member voting for May's deal will be run a strong risk of deselection.  And because those Labour MPs wouldn't have the votes to actually put May's deal over the top, they would be committing political suicide to no end.

It's time to face the hard truth.  The numbers do not add up for May's deal.  Never have.  Never will.

&gt; There aren't that many Tories who'll vote for a second referendum. 

Of course there are.  May's majority now stands at what?  4 MPs? 5?  This after the recent defections, but including the DUP.  

Many reports this week, (including from some of the nation's most conservative newspapers) say that somewhere in the range of 20 Tory MPs have now threatened to quit the party unless No Deal is ruled out.  Even even only 1/5th of those actually carried out the threat, the government would collapse.

The most likely path from here is a delay, followed by a referendum, a general election, or revocation.  This largely dependent on whether the EU allows a delay.  And at this point, a delay may only be permitted if May gives the EU a viable rationale for that delay.  Many in the EU do not consider a deadlocked Parliament  a rational justification.  They claim it will take a referendum or a GE.

So of all the various end points, Revocation is IMHO, the one with the best odds today.  But May could change this at a whim were she to support a GE or Referendum.

Why do you believe this? There is a very strong consensus that glyphosate is safe for consumers. Even the strongest reasonable nay-sayers argue that doses which *applicators* are exposed to cause minor increases in the risk of getting a certain kind of cancer.

It really seems like you read a bunch of organic industry propaganda and didn't think critically about it. There is huge financial incentive to demonize glyphosate.

Glyphosate allows farmers to adopt no-till methods, so it massively reduces carbon emissions associated with tillage. By increasing yield per acre, it also helps reduce habitat destruction. It breaks down quickly, doesn't readily leach into watersheds, and has minimal off-target toxicity. Farmers aren't stupid, they switched away from atrazine/cyanazine/eptc/alachlor --- have you even *heard of those herbicides?*

**World Health Organization**: [""In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.""](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)

However, Paris has been sacked by basically every invading force (And could argue by themselves in the French Revolution) I'm not really aware of any time Paris wasn't immediately surrendered upon being sacked at that. Russia did it (You brought up Napoleon, but the Battle of Paris took all of 30 hours to win the city... this is what led to Napoleon's exile), the Danish ransacked the city (Until the King of France had to literally pay them to leave), Germany of course, Prussia did it also in the late 1800s.

So Paris has surrendered. A lot.

That being said, the French army and history is as expansive as you say. There is no United States without France. France didn't follow suit with other European countries and attempt to help out the Confederacy, I mean, look up the Battle of Verdun. They turned away a MILLION German soliders with their numbers below 200k. 

There also isn't a D-Day without the French resistance isolating Normandy and without the Yanks, well, wir sprechen alle Deutsch. 

France hasn't kept a continuous empire for 400 years, much less 800 The French Empire is younger than the United States. So I'm not sure what you are referring to. (Remember they had a Monarchy and were a Republic after that Monarchy was overthrown)

I think, ironically enough, that that 800 year figure is actually referring to Britain. Famously no one has invaded the main island in almost a literal millennium (1066). Before WW1, literally 25% of the WORLD'S population was under British rule. 

Sorry this is super long winded and to meme on Paris in such a way is a playful jab, but one that isn't based on meme and meme alone.

It's a fine office but nothing compared to my wonderful old dentist who isn't covered by my insurance anymore :( It's a different hygienist at this new dentist's office every time. I go in to get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist is a, like, late 40's early 50's Eastern European woman. She asks if I've ever had braces. I say no. She tells me that I should get braces. I say no thanks. She asks if I am married or have kids. I say no.

She then tells me that I'd have a much easier time getting a husband if I got braces.

I WAS LIVID, and this woman's fingers were in my mouth so all I could do was fume instead of raging at her. Like. #1 that is such a stupid way to sell orthodontics #2 she is a hygienist, not even the dentist, why is she recommending braces for me??? #3 I am pretty gay, I do not want a husband!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Blood Command is a post-hardcore/punk band from Bergen in Norway . The band was started in 2008 by Yngve Andersen (guitar, bass guitar and keyboard) from Jeroan Drive. He brought Silje Tombre on vocals and Sigurd Haakaas on drums. The band was one of the nominees for the Årets Urørt in 2010 and was nominated for the Spellemannprisen for best rock album (Ghostlocks) in 2011. The album also reached across borders; The single Cult of the New Beat was in rotation at BBC and the music magazine Rock Sound praised the band as ""Band of the Week"".

&gt; In August 2011 Blood Command was support for the Canadian hardcore band Comeback Kid in Europe.
In 2015, vocalist Silje Tombre was replaced with Karina Ljone.

&gt; After some absence, Blood Command came back in 2017 with their album Cult Drugs which released on April 29, 2017.

Because after WW2 America came and occupied them and never left and told them they're going to be democratic or else they'll be attacked.

I have a creeping suspicion you're a kid. 

The British Empire came BEFORE the USA and the British Empire was NOT democratic.

So other nations adopt democracy not because 'its the best system' but because they're forced to by an imperialist power?

Because a man is stronger in association with others. Because men want a woman (as part of biology), because they want kids. Because men and women are not biologically equal.

Also, Algiers was a military victory for the French. Their tactics in urban warfare is studied to this day. The political aspect of the war was lost. Just like America in Vietnam. 

America saved no one in WWI. Germany was starving by 1918 and Ludendorff's last offensive was futile. He also wanted to focus on the British because he was terrified of French artillery which by 1918 was vastly superior to the Germans. The French Army in 1918 was one of the most modern and mobile in the world. Also, the Allies were lead by a Frenchmen, Ferdinand Foch and it was the Second Battle of the Marne that ended the German offensive. Most of the divisions that fought were French. 44 in fact, out of 58. World War I was not a tie, it was a victory shared by the French and British (Haig, Amiens) while the Americans helped. 

""Italian Wars"" which ones? If it weren't for France, modern Italy wouldn't have existed.

Franco-Prussian War: Sure, France's worse defeat. They bet too much on the most advanced rifle of the time, the Chasspot, but the Germans had the breach loading Krupp guns. Thanks to the French rifle, the Germans suffered horrific losses. The war was a major setback, but France outmaneuvered Germany in overseas colonies, especially in Africa effectively making them the second most powerful European power on the continent. 

World War II: French government surrendered, but Free French forces lead by De Gaulle fought until the end of the war. 

Napoleonic Wars/Wars of the Coalitions: 5 out of 7 isn't bad. Napoleon lead in Wars of the Coalition 3 to 7, the French winning the first two while he was in short pants. 

American Revolution: LOL! We wouldn't have existed if it weren't for French support. The British would have CRUSHED the rebellion and we wouldn't be much different than Canada or Australia. 

Funny you mentioned condoms. American soldiers weren't issued them. Some puritanical bullshit. Same with the British. There were more causes of VD than Trench foot. They couldn't outfuck the Canadians though. Canadians got the worse of it. The French issued condoms to their troops. So did the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, Austro-Hungarians, ect.

BloomsdayDevice,1371425672.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c278b,False,"&gt; In Latin, h was always pronounced.

I know this is not really part of your answer to OP's question (an answer which is both clear and accurate), but this warrants a bit of clarification. And I think it also explains to some extent why the distinction is maintained in French.

We teach that Latin always pronounced the 'h, and indeed we have it on good authority from ancient sources that failing to pronounce the 'h' was cause for reproach, BUT it's very clear that aspiration disappeared in spoken Latin quite early. It was retained, artificially, in *written* Latin, and surely educated speakers continued to affect its use--again, just as our ancient sources make clear--but it was gone or evanescent in most dialects already by the end of the Republic. There are plenty of examples of words whose earlier etymologies we can reconstruct and which ought to have had an aspiration, but do not. E.g., *anser* ""goose"" is never spelled with an ""h"", but the Proto-Indo-European root (whence also English ""gander"", with the expected Germanic sound changes in place) must have had an aspiration, and *hanser* must have been an earlier form. Similarly, *er* and *ericius*, both ""hedgehog"", must have been *her* and *hericius* at an early stage, based on comparative evidence, though these spellings (and presumably pronunciations) are never used. And there are numerous other examples where a spelling with the aspiration is in relatively equal alternation with a spelling without (e.g., *aedus* ""[goat] kid"" with etymological and attested *haedus*; *nihil* ""nothing"" alongside *nīl*, with expected contraction and lengthening; *mihi* ""to me* and *mī*). The retention in Classical Latin is artificial, but it's also unquestionably a feature of the prestige dialect of Latin that supplied the literary language (which is why we teach it as part of Latin phonology).

But what's even more interesting, in my opinion, is how aspiration was forcefully introduced into words where it never should have been in the first place. This actually happens a lot: *humere* ""be damp"" from etymological *umere*; *harundo* ""reed"" for more securely reconstructed *arundo*; even in proper nouns, like *Ahenobarbus* (a name that means more or less ""red-beard"", but ought to have been spelled *Aenobarbus*, from the Latin words for ""[of] copper"", *aenus*, and ""beard"", *barba*). We even have commentary from Latin authors who note, with patent mockery, the obvious affectations of speakers who misapply aspiration and end up sounding silly to those who know where it ""belongs"" and where it doesn't.

So it was such a distinctive feature of the best regarded varieties of Latin that pretenders tried, sometimes haphazardly, to insert it even where it didn't belong, sort of like if I started using ""whom""--which is NOT part of my native dialect of English--all over the place, but didn't really know where or how to do it (a phenomenon called ""hypercorrection""). I think this interest in faking the aitch sound, and the association of the sound with more cultured speakers, must have persisted into Romance, and probably contributed to its continued effect--reduced now merely to an obstacle to liaison--in French.",True,False,False,,0,1551509569,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehm2n05,False,t3_awbvov,False,t1_ehluwpt,/r/etymology/comments/awbvov/source_of_muted_and_aspirated_h_in_french/ehm2n05/,False,,1555313592,10,True,False,etymology,t5_2qspe,r/etymology,public,

Ainda na carceragem da PF, o petista, que era muito ligado ao menino, chorou aos soluços ao ouvir o relato da boca do chefe da custódia. Com a foto de Arthur que mantém na cela nas mãos, o ex-presidente repetia que a morte da criança contrariava a lógica da vida. Aliados demonstraram profunda preocupação. Este, avaliam, é o golpe mais duro já sofrido por ele desde a prisão.

 **Meu guri** Em caráter excepcional, a direção da carceragem da PF permitiu a entrada de Gleisi Hoffmann, presidente do PT, na cela. Lula também foi autorizado a falar com os advogados. Arthur chegou a morar com o petista por um período e foi visitar o avô na cadeia por duas vezes.

 **À flor da pele **O próprio Lula pediu que o PT desestimulasse atos políticos[ no velório do neto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/lula-consegue-saida-temporaria-da-prisao-para-velorio-de-neto.shtml). Desta vez, houve extremo cuidado da defesa no encaminhamento do caso. Pela reação do ex-presidente à notícia, ninguém queria dar munição para que a solicitação de saída temporária fosse rejeitada.

 **Passou da conta** Com quem falava, Lula repetia que, ao receber a visita inusitada do chefe da custódia, imaginou que algo teria acontecido a algum familiar, mas disse que jamais poderia projetar a morte do neto de sete anos.

 **Para ontem **Integrantes do STJ acreditam que, pelo ritmo do processo, o recurso de Lula [contra sua condenação](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/em-8-meses-lula-so-apareceu-publicamente-duas-vezes-e-recebeu-centenas-de-visitas.shtml) no caso do tríplex do Guarujá (SP) será julgado até junho.

A liberação de verbas faz parte do pacote de bondades montado para atrair aliados na Câmara e no Senado.

 **Finge que não viu** Jair Bolsonaro admitiu a auxiliares que sua fala sobre a possível redução da idade mínima de mulheres na reforma da Previdência foi um equívoco. A ordem na equipe econômica é seguir defendendo arduamente a proposta tal como ela foi enviada ao Congresso.

O Planalto chamou como representante de uma emissora de TV um jornalista homônimo que, na verdade, trabalha em uma rádio –no fim, nenhum dos dois compareceu.

Broadly speaking, many of America's regions are fairly distinct by ancestral makeup when it comes to original nation of origin. ""The South"" and ""The North"" that you hear about?

He is a known cynic literati who´s reciting a poem he wrote in answer to Kant´s epitaph on how Kant himself´s among the reasons why humanity is inevitably moving towards the realization of eternal peace. The context of it is that he saw the population walking into the slaugther of WW1 and WW2 with cheers and joy, neither events he ever felt particularily positive about and both of which really seemed to diverge wildly from Kant´s proposed straight and narrow towards eternal peace he allegedly set humanity on.

&gt;and why does it feel like Nazi propaganda?

Because the recording technology is from the period, because the person in question is talking in German and because you picked something way out of your league as far as language comprehension goes. We´re talking about an author who´s considered the top of the crop in the literate use of the german language, taking a shot at Kant.
There might be some additional reasons, but everybody and their mums are using English on reddit.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

But yes, absolutely, google translate is garbage for Arabic unless you figure out how to use it properly, and then it's only mediocre.

Things to keep in mind for the basics:

- Arabic has sun and moon consonants. These are consonants where, if they're at the beginning of a word, they morph a definite article in front of them. So ""Al-Nar"" becomes ""An-Nar"". Here's a list for you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_and_moon_letters

- Arabic is a Semitic language, not an Indo-European one, so it generally cares less about vowels and more about consonants. This may seem weird but, cn yu red this? Then you can understand how Arabic speakers do, and *then* keep in mind that, on top of this intuition, unmarked vowels are pretty natural and have consistent rules anyway. When Arabic does have vowels written, they're with special characters in the form of diacritics (little markers that get tacked onto words like add-ons) or full on letters. The difference is length and emphasis. When vowels get transliterated into English though, they like to do this with Macrons. A kind of diacritic for English that goes over the vowel, making it longer.

In terms of veganism in general, the most important thing is to get the Happy Cow app if you don't have it already (it'll show you places that are fully vegan, fully vegetarian, or just simply have good veg options). There's also a Facebook group called Vegan Travel, where you can search for whatever place you're going to and see past recommendations. If you can't find it, I'll send you the link.

The easiest countries for me were India (both North and South), anywhere in Europe, and Canada/US. There really hasn't been anywhere hard yet tbh. Maybe a resort in Cuba I went to with my family, but that doesn't really count since it was a resort rather than Cuba itself (i.e. I didn't have any choice of restaurant or grocery store). My East Africa trips were before I was vegan, but there were a lot of plant-based foods there too. I haven't actually been to Southeast Asia, but at least in Buddhist countries (and Bali I guess), I would expect there to be a lot of veg options.

Also, I don't want to assume anything, but I have noticed that some new vegan travellers look too much for vegan-only places. While they do exist in places I wouldn't have expected, it's definitely not a guarantee, plus they might have more global foods instead of local cuisine.

Now for Turkey, it is indeed for the capital accumulation more than anything else. For instance in Syria the Aleppo region is one if not the biggest industrial center of the whole middle east, that's why they were that much fight for Aleppo controle. 

But also there is an interest for Turkish in breaking the back of their military opponents, and in middle east it was mainly Syria and Iraq and Iran that have massive army, now that Syria and Iraq army are destroyed by the USA, the last remaining strong army is Iran. As USA stopped the sanction etc... Against Iran and as they dropped Erdogan off, with Gülen coup, remain the only one Alliance possible for Turkish to at least restrain their opponent, the Russian Alliance. 

Also they did it because as they shooted down 2 Russian Fight jet a few years ago, they have thing to apologize for, and buying Russian weapon instead of USA one is one way to make this apologize. 

To conclude, I would add that they have to buy weaponry somewhere now that USA and Turkey have officially break down their Alliance. 

You could add also the Qatar/Saoudie fight for Muslim leadership, that is transposed by a Turkey / Egypt fight for Muslim brotherhood controle, among other Islamic group, and a other layer that is seen as an European vs Russia things, since Europe refused to admit Turkey as a legitimate member. But I think it is minor in this game.

Edit: buying weapon is kinda a way to swear allegiance nowadays too, like NATO do with El famoso 3% of gdp  in weaponry rule. 

Edit 2: I've missed one point from your comments, sorry, imperialism is made as a pyramidal / patriarchal  / mafialike system, in which the bigger accredite the smaller, kinda like in the feudalism. There is one aspect of this situation that is highly effective for USA, it's the financement of one side of a country against the other one, making civil war, or acknowledging regional Gendarme regime as their servants, making smaller imperialism. Look how Saudi Arabia, despite being an ultra poor, not developed country without any real army is playing in a regional level despite any local reality. 

Why it is that much effective for USA especially, because it allow the government to bypass the constitutional rule of asking to the congress the permission to go to war. It is ultra convenient because if they had to clearly state that they are training Syrian rebel in view of making a coup, they couldn't make their propaganda narrative in the media.

If you're in Europe, the Wayfinder server has a lot of Europeans playing, but otherwise it's quite small and best avoided.  Argonnesson, Khyber, Gland, and Cannith are the most populated.  Personally, I'd say go with Argonnesson, as it's populated, well-established, and there's a ton of veterans to draw information from: case in point, one of the developers of the game was holding fun events on each server for the anniversary, and there were so many people gathered in one spot on Argonnesson that the server started lagging.  Lot of people on Argo to play with.
2. VIP is useful but not a must; you can play the entire game without spending a single penny if you put the effort into it.  But, play the game, first.  Do a few characters, see if you enjoy it and get at least one into the middle heroic levels (8-12).  The higher level you are, the more difficult it can be to level as F2P as you don't have access to various adventure packs (which, again, can be earned with a little elbow grease).  The expansions are well worth buying, though.  Also, you can pay just a tiny amount of money and get some DDOPoints to spend and get get upgraded premium status, which is basically the standard for those that aren't VIP.  I'm not VIP nor have I ever been, but I've spent at least $400 on expansions and points since I started in 2009: I own everything there is to own in the game, having earned it with a little hard work with some extra points to spend via the occasional double/triple points sales.
3. Yes.  You'll find a lot of soloers or people in small, tight-knit groups (and more than enough large guilds and the average 'pugger' to play with).  There are people who make specialized builds that might not be of much use in a group, but are excellent soloers.  It does, in my opinion, get more fun with groups, as you form adventuring parties and help each other win (like reaper difficulty, which is absurdly difficult for those that are unprepared, where you have a self-healing penalty, forcing you to rely on each other to progress).  Like somebody else said, ask around:  DDO players love to talk about builds and will talk your ear off about their personal favorites.  There's a lot of us veterans with old war stories to keep the youngins occupied.
4. Absolutely yes.  You'll hear this phrase a lot: there really isn't any other game like DDO on the market.  I've checked.  There isn't.  As far as customization of builds, DDO has just about every other game beat, hands down.  Thanks to the multiclass system, you can pick and mix up to 3 classes on one character at a time, making your build highly customizable.  I will say, however, that DDO does have a bit of a grind to it, but that grind has been built into the game on purpose through a process called reincarnation, which allows you to get to a certain level and then go back to level 1, keeping all of your gear and money but giving you special, permanent past life bonuses that stack depending on what race or class you reincarnated from (my main character is currently on his 63rd reincarnation, and, in my opinion, has become an exceptional killing machine).",True,False,False,,0,1551534186,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehmkh65,False,t3_awg6yh,False,t3_awg6yh,/r/ddo/comments/awg6yh/interested_in_starting_this_game/ehmkh65/,False,,1555323343,5,True,False,ddo,t5_2r62z,r/ddo,public,

In the sagas, Freya typically has a sort of romantic or sexual relationship with her chosen heroes, so I usually approach her with the sorts of gifts I would give a romantic partner, fresh flowers, champagne, chocolate, etc.  Amber and gold as both minerals and colors are associated with her, because of the brisingamen.  I'm eventually going to dedicate an Amber pendant to her, but I haven't yet.    On her day, Friday, I always try to be nice to a cat if I get the chance,  since that's her animal.

&gt;And has anyone asked her to initiate them into the art of seiðr?

I specifically asked her this and I got a response in a dream within a month.  Unfortunately at the time I wasn't keeping a dream journal and my memory of it faded.  I've asked her to come again but it hasn't happened yet.  All I remember was Freya giving me instructions for making further contact with her, something involving white candles.  I really wish I had more details, I don't recommend going off of my vague dream, the stuff I mentioned in the first half of my comment is more commonly accepted wisdom.

For seior in general, just keep in mind that we actually have no idea what they did.  Definitely read the wikipedia page because it gives a good overview of what we actually know.  I don't self label as practicing seior, but I assume it was """"just"""" a northern european indegenous form of shamanism so that's the direction my practice went in.

&gt; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she supports school students&amp;#039; protests about climate change.

&gt; On Friday thousands of high school students in the city of Hamburg marched against climate change, with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg - who started the series of school strikes - present.

&gt; Asked about the Friday school strikes, which in Germany have been dubbed &amp;quot;Fridays for Future&amp;quot;, Ms Merkel said the country&amp;#039;s climate goals could only be reached with the support of wider society.

williambotter,1542234059.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2lm23pua,False," Assistimos, nesta semana, a mais uma chanchada dos figurantes de “Chaves” ora instalados nos palácios brasilienses. O ministro da Educação propôs, numa carta endereçada a diretores de escolas públicas, que os alunos fossem filmados cantando o hino nacional.

 A presepada animou um pouco a já cansada troca de ofensas virtuais entre simpatizantes e detratores do governo. Bolsonaristas ainda aguerridos dizem que “vai ter hino, sim” e que “quem reclamar vai ajoelhar no milho”.

 Bonito.

 Desculpe o palpite extravagante, mas não resisto. Que tal se o ministro se preocupasse com questões um pouco mais relevantes? A merenda escolar, por exemplo.

 Aparentemente, as diretrizes da administração atual vão no sentido contrário. Tenta-se emplacar, em escala nacional, algum tipo de plano de educação à distância para crianças. Hectares a perder de vista de terreno fértil para a doutrinação.

 E, não menos importante, sem merenda. O Telecurso 2019 exime o aparato estatal de alimentar a garotada. Imagina o quanto vão economizar? Vai dar para colocar um cabo e um soldado de plantão em cada escola que sobrar neste Brasilzão.

 O nostálgicos dos anos de chumbo fingem ignorar que o regime militar –seu norte de retidão– foi quem começou o desmonte do ensino público de qualidade para crianças e adolescentes.

 Sou de 1970, ano do frisson canarinho. Minhas duas irmãs, mais velhas, cursaram todo o ciclo básico em escola municipal. O que tinha de melhor. Depois saíram para um colégio de elite, privilegiadas que eram.

 Eu, para usar metáfora culinária, peguei a última raspa do tacho. Minha mãe era diretora de um “parque infantil” –assim chamávamos na época as EMEIs. Fiquei por lá até os 6 anos.

 A funcionária favorita era Cida, a cozinheira. Ela nos servia o básico dos básicos: macarrão com salsicha, ovo cozido, carne moída. Tonto, eu invejava os amiguinhos que precisavam levar lancheira para a escola.

 A entrada no esquema particular foi traumática. As tais lancheiras continham pasta de atum, bebidas artificiais de cores berrantes e coisas indecifráveis. Tudo bem, legal mesmo era comprar a merenda na cantina.

 A cantina vendia hambúrguer seboso e uma coleção de porcarias industriais. O pior era a bebida, refrigerante quente adquirido numa portinha ao lado. O engradado de Coca-Cola era de madeira, crianças!

 Hoje, a escola do meu filho segue o manual do bom-moço-zona-oeste: frutas, fibras e nada de chocolate na lancheira. Já a merenda do sistema público virou lavanderia de dinheiro, fora uma ou outra boa iniciativa.

 O assunto desinteressa ao circo federal. Ainda bem, pensando bem: tristes as crianças que recebessem pão com leite condensado no recreio.

katilakoski,1340314453.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_82r59,False,"&gt;Not her initiative. Other PM's would have been pressured to do the same.

She was the one who triggered it. The essence of leadership is making the decisions you feel are correct despite external pressure or influence and bringing people to see your point of view. 

In that vain either she thought triggering article 50 was a good idea or she's such a poor leader she chose the easy option of relenting to external pressure on it instead of doing g what she felt was best for the country. 

&gt;Tories are a mess, not by her design or responsibility. These were arguably the best methods to secure solidarity within the party. Stop voting Tory if you do not like the way Tories manage things, the PM has no real power here.

Again, one of the primary responsibilities of the PM is to appoint a cabinet with persons she feels can best deliver on the brief. If she chose to neglect this instead for party political reasons that's her perogative, but it's a decision *she* made. Incompetents being in cabinet are only there because the PM appointed them.

And how did that decision work out btw? The likes of Boris and David Davis are now sniping from the sidelines anyway. Overall it's reflective of a very poor decision making process by the PM for extending on olive branch to these people in the first place. 

&gt;Which, at the time, predicted a landslide victory. You can blame her for campaigning poorly or what not, but that is ultimately unrelated to Brexit. The electorate chose to elect parliament as it is right now, and THAT is what is causing this mess.

I will blame her for a poor campaign, because it was horrendous. And it is related to brexit, because the whole election campaign was to strengthen her hand in parliament for that very issue.

&gt;This sort of statement just radiates naivete, no matter how good you are at negotiating there is a minimum of two parties at the table, and your control is ultimately minimal. Who could have done better, what could they have done better? You need to think about these things before pointing fingers.

Whether anyone else could do better is irrelevant.  Engaging in what ifs and counter factuals achieves nothing but muddy the waters of the debate with supposition. The facts of the matter are that the PM has handled negotiating with all parties involved poorly. 

She scuppered her own negotiations with the EU by triggering A50 early and calling the GE, then failing to draw up a coherent brexit position and strategy beyond contradictory red lines. Throughout this process she failed to bring the various warring brexit factions on board in developing any sort of coherent policy, and failed to get an early idea of exactly what sort of brexit might command some support in parliament. Once her plan was declared dead on arrival she's then completely failed to produce, or even remotely work towards, any sort of alternative other than repeatedly revoting on the same old shite until she gets the answer she likes. 

&gt;No, parliamentary division exists because of MPs with different agendas being forced into an ungodly conglomerate like the Tory party due to the nature of your political system, which leads to politics being more about placating the opposition than cooperating or compromising.

Its the exact same system every other PM in British history has had to operate under. Plenty of them have succeeded in uniting their respective parties with a little thing called *leadership*, which is a skill the current PM has a profound absence of.

A Acusação, de um autor que se chama Bandi.

São sete contos escritos por essa pessoa que ninguém vai saber quem é, senão será morta pelo regime do Kim Jong-Un na mesma hora. Nesses contos, escritos durante o regime de Kim Il-sung e Kim Jong-il, ele revela como a cabeça dos norte coreanos funciona e é simplesmente maravilhoso. Vc vai lendo os contos e quando percebe dá até agonia quando entende realmente o que se passa por trás dos panos por lá. É um registro humanitário sobre uma sociedade fechada que pouquíssimos tem chance de entender como funciona.

Bandi merece muito um premio Nobel de Literatura por esse livro.

No, allied is the wrong word.  If you think Stalin felt he could ever be friends with the fascists long term then you haven't studied his views enough.

&gt;To say America did nothing is very unfair.

They didn't do *nothing*, but their role in the war tends to be overstated.  Lend lease was pretty minor until 1943, after the Soviets had stopped the German advance.  Early lend lease did arrive at critical times, but the image Americans have that the Soviets only won because of their help is largely bullshit.

Also, the United States didn't really begin fighting Germany until 1943 and even then not all-out until 1944.  The Wehrmacht in the West during the invasion of Normandy was weak.  Rommel, who was tasked with the defense, IIRC said the defenses were like 11% completed.

To say that America's war with Germany was anything but secondary to the Great Patriotic War is honestly just wrong.

Golden Boot: Two bold predictions here, one being that no one scores more than 20. Martinez might not replicate his form from last year, and Zlatan might be injured a lot and not get adequate service. I think we'll see a lot of strikers score in the high teens, but none 20 or more. Secondly, I think a goalscoring winger will win the Golden Boot this year instead of a pure #9...so I'll give it to Vela.

DOTY: I wouldn't be surprise if Trusty has a breakout year. He's 6'5, good on the ball, and a good tackler. He needs to work on his decision making, but that can absolutely be worked on at his age. He's a player on the cusp of the USMNT, being invited to the Janaury Camp, and I have a feeling this is the year he cements himself as one of the depth options for the national team.

GOTY: Przemyslaw Tyton. I have high hopes for him. You guys will be pleasantly surprised. He's IMO at least at the level of Robles and Melia. Yes, he was benched in Europe...but so was Guzan, who Wiebe nominates for the award. If Cincy make the playoffs in their inaugrual year (and I absolutely wouldn't underestimate them like many are doing) he'll win it.

ROTY: who the fuck knows? it's restricted to first year American developed players and as we know they're typically not ready to be starters right from the get go, barring exceptions like Lima or Gressel. Let's go with Amaya.

COTY: Garde or Bradley. I expect Montreal to make the playoffs and make a deep run, and I similarly expect LAFc to be one of the top teams in the West.

Comeback Player of the Year: I bet MLS will give it to Morris, but it should really be Mihailovic

NOTY: Let's say Nani helps lead Orlando to the playoffs for the first time. He still has a lot to give at his age.

MVP: This is a tough one...but I love what I saw from Quintero last year. He seriously reminded me of Giovinco's first season.

 Ao contrÃ¡rio do que parece, ninguÃ©m estÃ¡ bebendo cachaÃ§a como se fosse refrigerante. A Corote Sabores Ã© feita a base de vodca. E diferente da sua âirmÃ£ mais velhaâ, de quem herdou a embalagem âbarrigudinhaâ, possui 13,5% de graduaÃ§Ã£o alcoÃ³lica, bem menos que os 40% da aguardente.

 Os 500ml de vodca misturada com essÃªncias que vÃ£o do tradicional limÃ£o ao exÃ³tico blueberry eram vendidos por de R$ 8 nos blocos de Carnaval de SÃ£o Paulo. Nos bares, trÃªs garrafas saiam por R$ 10 âmesmo valor pago por trÃªs latinhas de 269ml de cerveja. No varejo, a garrafinha custa R$ 3.

 âCom duas garrafinhas dessas eu jÃ¡ estou bÃªbado. Fica muito mais barato [do que beber cerveja]â, disse um foliÃ£o durante o bloco Baixo Augusta, no domingo anterior ao do Carnaval, enquanto tomava a segunda garrafa da bebida sabor pÃªssego.

  

Ao todo sÃ£o oito sabores, para o Carnaval, a Missiato vai lanÃ§ar o de Tutti Fruti. âO pessoal ficou louco. Mandamos umas caixas para os clientes experimentarem e nÃ£o vamos dar conta de entregar os pedidos feitos para o Carnavalâ, afirma o diretor-presidente da empresa, Paulo Missiato.

 Os universitÃ¡rios do interior de SÃ£o Paulo foram os principais responsÃ¡veis pelo sucesso da Corote Sabores. Segundo Missiato, a empresa viu âuma grande oportunidade voltada ao pÃºblico universitÃ¡rio, pois alÃ©m de fazer muitas festas, eles buscam produtos mais acessÃ­veisâ.

 A âbarrigudinhaâ se deu bem na crise econÃ´mica dos Ãºltimos dois anos. âPrincipalmente o consumidor mais jovem, e mais afetado pelo desemprego e pela informalidade no mercado de trabalho, queria manter suas ocasiÃµes de lazer, mas queria algo mais baratoâ, afirma Maria AngÃ©lica Salado, analista sÃªnior de pesquisa da Euromonitor Internacional.

 Criada hÃ¡ quatro anos, a Corote Sabores Ã© tida como um divisor de Ã¡guas dentro da Missiato. A indÃºstria com mais de 60 anos, localizada em Santa Rita do Passa Quatro (250 km de SÃ£o Paulo). Nos Ãºltimos dois anos, a empresa cresceu 40%, em grande parte por causa da bebida saborizada.

 Para falar com o novo pÃºblico consumidor, a marca precisou mudar a forma de lidar com os varejistas.

 âCom a cachaÃ§a, a gente colocava um banner nos mercados ou dava um pano de prato para os donos dos bares, mas com a Corote Sabores tivemos de fazer uma comunicaÃ§Ã£o diferenciada, contratamos agÃªncia, investimos nas redes sociaisâ, afirma.

 Entre as fotos que a marca publica no Instagram nÃ£o faltam universitÃ¡rias dando beijinhos nas garrafinhas de bebida. Tem atÃ© uma dupla de braÃ§os masculinos com o âCâ da marca tatuado. âOs universitÃ¡rios adotaram a Corote Sabores como um filhinhoâ, diz Missiato.

 Para atender os fÃ£s, a empresa jÃ¡ planeja criar um e-commerce, onde vai vender bonÃ©s e camisetas com o logo da Corote.

 AlÃ©m a internet, as vendas cresceram depois que o produto passou a ser divulgado nas atlÃ©ticas das faculdades (normalmente, responsÃ¡veis por organizar as festas).

 Hoje, a marca estÃ¡ entre as patrocinadoras das grandes festas universitÃ¡rias do interior de SÃ£o Paulo, como Tusca, InterUnesp e Federal Fantasy. Tanto que no estado, a bebida com sabor Ã© lÃ­der de vendas âa empresa tambÃ©m fabrica cachaÃ§a, vodca, ice e catuaba.

 Em uma festa da faculdade CÃ¡sper LÃ­bero, em SÃ£o Paulo, a reportagem acompanhou a chegada e o rÃ¡pido fim das garrafinhas âas primeiras a acabar no bar.

 âEu fico louco muito mais rÃ¡pidoâ, disse um dos frequentadores da festa.

 Segundo o dono da marca, para as festas, os universitÃ¡rios chegam a comprar 500 caixas da bebida, com 12 unidades em casa. Ele diz que o segredo do sucesso estÃ¡ na qualidade e no custo-benefÃ­cio. âA bebida Ã© filtrada sete vezes e tri-destilada. Todas as impurezas vÃ£o embora e vocÃª nÃ£o tem aquela dor de cabeÃ§a no dia seguinteâ.

 Esse ano, a Missiato aposta no Carnaval. A empresa fez uma parceria com a UniÃ£o dos Blocos de Carnaval de Rua de SÃ£o Paulo e terÃ¡ mais de 500 pontos de degustaÃ§Ã£o da bebida.

 Missiato aguarda o fim da festa para confirmar os bons resultados. âEsse ano a distribuiÃ§Ã£o foi muito maior, vamos esperar como vÃ£o ser os pedidos de reposiÃ§Ã£o dos clientesâ, diz.

 âLevando em consideraÃ§Ã£o a situaÃ§Ã£o do nosso paÃ­s nos anos anteriores, a Missiato vem na contramÃ£o de outras empresas, alcanÃ§ando nÃºmeros crescentes a cada ano, tanto em volume fÃ­sico, como em faturamentoâ.

 O teor alcoÃ³lico mais baixo tambÃ©m colabora para o negÃ³cio, dado que os impostos sÃ£o menores. O tributo sobre a cachaÃ§a, por exemplo, chega a 80% do valor final.

 ""A cachaÃ§a hoje Ã© o produto mais tributado no Brasil. O IBPT [Instituto Brasileiro de Planejamento TributÃ¡rio] estima que cerca de 82% do preÃ§o final de uma cachaÃ§a sÃ£o impostosâ, afirma Carlos Lima, diretor-executivo do IBRAC (Instituto Brasileiro da CachaÃ§a).

 De acordo com a Euromonitor, seguindo a tendÃªncia que comeÃ§ou em 2017, o consumo das bebidas alcoÃ³licas saborizadas deve continuar em alta nos prÃ³ximos cinco anos â estima-se serÃ£o bebidos 171 mil litros desses produtos em 2022.

Charlie_Mouse,1452715361.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_trjyg,False,"Hi. I can’t really speak for all of Scotland - but to the best of my understanding at least ...


&gt;Do you support/understand Theresa May? What do you think on her political strategy (if any) on the négociations?

Heh, no we mostly don’t support her. Her Conservative party have not won an overall majority in Scotland for nearly 70 years now. If anything opposition to the Conservatives is one of the biggest things most Scots agree on. There are a handful (13?) of conservative MP’s in Scotland but many of the people who vote for them only do so to try to keep Scotland in the U.K. - we call them “Unionists”.

As for her strategy - it’s pretty obvious that she’s running down the clock to force Parliament to accept her ‘deal’ with the EU. This is hard for her because it’s a pretty awful deal compared to EU membership - so she wants to present a stark choice of either that deal or a ‘no deal’ crash exit from the EU which would be much worse - with no time left for any sensible alternatives.

The big concern is her strategy fails (she is not really a terribly good politician) leaving the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal and no time to fix that. 

&gt;Do you guys (as a nation) keep talking about leaving UK to join EU, do you know if some discussion has been done in that sense?

We certainly do on this sub! Also a lot of other Scots do too. Nearly two thirds of Scots supported staying in the EU in the Brexit referendum. We know the EU isn’t perfect but we like it a lot more than most of England appears to. 

&gt;What would you vote on a new Brexit referendum? Leave, so Scotland can legitimately ask to leave UK? Or remain, so you try to save all the unions (UK and with UE)?

Scotland would almost certainly vote to stay in the EU. Polling now has support even higher than before at &gt;70%

Independence from the U.K. is popular with Scots especially younger ones (by ‘young’ I mean under 50 years old or so!). It’s still hovering just under 50% in terms of support but I reckon Brexit will probably drive that number higher (full disclosure: this is a pretty pro independence subreddit and I’m also personally pro independence)

&gt;Are the Scottish involved or interested in the Ireland issue? 

Yes. There’s been historically a lot of movement between Scotland and Ireland. 

&gt;If Northern Ireland can remain in the back stop, why the Scotland can’t do so? 

That’s an excellent question! Yes, a lot of us would argue that too.

&gt;Is it possible to think that Northern Ireland and Scottland to leave the UK and actually make some kind of Gaelic Union, to actually join the UE? 

Remotely possible. We do talk about a Celtic Union in a friendly half-joking way sometimes however I suspect it’s unlikely in practice.

&gt;Or would they join UE separately?

Rather more likely. Northern Ireland would do it by unifying with Ireland, Scotland via independence and rejoining the EU - hopefully quite quickly.

&gt;I saw in this sub that you start talking about a new currency. Have your politicians also envisaged the euro?

Interesting and controversial subject. Be aware this has caused a few arguments and the pro-Union side use it a lot to try to score points off Scottish independence supporters. Possibilities include continuing to use the U.K. pound, creating a new currency pegged to the pound or creating a new currency pegged to the Euro, or trying to jump direct to the Euro. There are pros and cons to each. Personally I reckon Scotland will do whichever one makes most sense at the time we actually achieve independence.

Hope that helps - I’m sure others will have different perspectives though.

&gt; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she supports school students&amp;#039; protests about climate change.

&gt; On Friday thousands of high school students in the city of Hamburg marched against climate change, with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg - who started the series of school strikes - present.

&gt; Asked about the Friday school strikes, which in Germany have been dubbed &amp;quot;Fridays for Future&amp;quot;, Ms Merkel said the country&amp;#039;s climate goals could only be reached with the support of wider society.

Some Asians are pale while others are more tanned. My point is that the Water Tribe people's skin tone don't match with the skin tones of Inuit people.

Edit: Let me make my position perfectly clear. In the movie, the Water Tribes are played by white people, the Earth Kingdom by Asians, the Fire Nation by Indians and Aang by someone with Native American heritage. When I say this, I am talking about The Last Airbender MOVIE.

When I am talking mostly about Inuit people, my point is that even though the Water Tribe is based upon Inuit people, they are based of them CULTURALLY, not ETHNICALLY. I say this, because the Water Tribe are among the most dark skinned people in A:TLA compared to the other nations. Inuit people are NOT more dark skinned than Chinese, Koreans, Japanese etc. If anything, their skin is lighter. When I say lighter, I am talking about a PALE vs TAN relation, NOT a WHITE (as in European looking) vs BROWN (as in Middle-Eastern, Indian etc.) or BLACK (as in African, aborigines) looking.

CheckItDubz,1541646073.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k59xeqh,False,"&gt; This is interesting to know. Could you elaborate? Do you have any literature that would try to explain Europe’s environmentalist point of view on the topic?

I don't have any literature. However, notice this one point. 

It's not as easy as saying the left likes science and the right doesn't. It's all corporation based. If the science agrees with the average industry interest (e.g., GMOs and nuclear), the right usually likes it, and the left usually hates it. If the science disagrees with the average industry interest (e.g., climate change, the environment), the left usually likes it, and the right usually hates it. 

Vaccines are trickier. Corporations are pro-vaccines. In general, it seems like leftist *people* dislike vaccines more than the right, but leftist politicians like them more than the right.

If there's no industry interest (evolution, Big Bang), then the leftist usually likes the science more.

So basically, what I'm trying to say is that leftists are more likely to disagree with the science if that puts them on the same side as the corporations.


Conversely, one might view it as what's ""natural"". Leftists are more likely to dislike things that are large deviations of what's view as ""natural"" (GMOs, nuclear) and like things that are more ""natural"" (stopping human-caused climate change and environmental problems). On the other hand, the right is more likely to support any and all kinds of change (which is funny given their ""conservative"" name).

The last attempt to revitalize the Klan was probably David Duke's push in the 90s. He wanted to go from robes to business suits and open racism to ""defending European Americans"".  He was a representative here in Louisiana and almost won the Governor's race (Edward's campaign was basically: ""I'm a crook but ya know...he's a former Grand Wizard."" Or as he hilariously put it ""the only similarity between us is that we are both Wizards under the sheets."" He probably would've lost if he was running against anyone else.) 

Even by that point though he realized the KKK name had to go but he kept everything else.  He, and his Wizard successor Don Black (founder of Stormfront) continue to be big names on the fringes of Conservative politics.  Lately though that fringe is less fringe.  

I'm sure you remember Charlottesville.  Conservatives desperately tried to say it was just a protest to protect the monuments but it was a protest organized by and for white supremacists trying to pass as ordinary conservatives.  Richard Spencer was one of the organizers and he very much is continuing what David Duke started: legitimizing white supremacy.  And it sort of worked...a lot of conservatives think White Nationalism isn't white supremacy.  They think it's...white people being nationalists (which nope, that's not what it is).  Trump said there were good people on both sides of that rally and called himself a ""nationalist"" shortly after.  Guess who was a top billed guest speaker at that rally?  David Fucking Duke.  

I even got into a conversation with someone I considered a fairly reasonable conservative who tried to argue that David Duke left the Klan a while ago and didn't hold those views.  As someone from the city David Duke lives in (and I have known many people who's parents were friends with him) I was shocked he managed to convince anyone of this.  He never stopped pushing ideas like ""black people evolved to be less intelligent"" or ""the Holocaust didn't happen"" or ""white genocide"" (which Fox News has been pushing now) he's slowly weaseling his way back into mainstream politics.  And Richard Spencer/White Nationalists/the Alt Right are all descended from his attempts to make white supremacy mainstream and socially acceptable.

As a result, America was just as anti-semitic as much with Canada and the UK. In addition, the Immigration Act of 1924 severely limited Eastern European immigration, but gave preference to persons from the British Isles, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Scandinavian countries. However, quotas were established by the act of how much immigrants could be admitted from these countries.

&gt; Paragraph 106.
&gt;     
&gt; That Act [2015 Referendum Act] falls to be interpreted in light of the basic constitutional principles of Parliamentary sovereignty and representative parliamentary democracy which apply in the United Kingdom, which lead to the conclusion that *a referndum on any topic can only be advisory for the lawmakers in Parliament unless very clear language to the contrary is used in the referendum legislation in question*. No such language is used in the 2015 Referendum Act.

That means, referendums are generally only advisory, unless the specific referendum legislation is very clearly worded to the contrary—which is not the case in the Brexit referendum.

Thor and Valkyrie help a group of slaves/prisoners break free from their uncaring captor. Thor learns about the horrible history and beginnings of Asgard, helps to tear down their opulence in favour of saving their people - who are more important than their status.

Att använda fördefinierade listor öppnar upp för möjligheter till så mycket mer missbruk och det sätter även ur spel allas likhet inför lagen. 

Trodde jag svarade på detta förut, men det blev visst bortklippt. 

Varje åtal av terrorsamröre måste ju bevisa både att det rör sig om samröre och att det rör sig om en terroristorganisation. Som du själv säger så är det problematiskt att avgöra om en organisation är en terroristorganisation.

&gt; Problemet med att kriminalisera stöd av terrorism är än en gång definitionerna. Exempelvis så är det inte helt orealistiskt att exempelvis kurderna eller palestinier skulle fort kunna komma att falla under denna definition. Det finns även regimer världen över där det inte är konstigt att vissa delar av folket tar till våld mot regimen. Att då exempelvis stödja ett uppror i en diktatorisk stat skulle kunna räknas som stöd till terrorism. Ett dagsfärskt exempel skulle kunna vara att stödja de som vill avsätta Venezuelas president. 

Det är ju inte minst politiskt känsligt. I och med all den desinformation och propaganda som finns i syfte att klassa organisationer som terroristorganisationer så behöver organisationerna utredas noggrant.

Vice Consul Sugihara Chiune might have faded into history as a minor diplomat in Lithuania had he not issued thousands of transit visas to refugees, including those who fulfilled few visa requirements.

A Buick stylist named Ned Nickles is credited with the creation of Ventiports; he customized his personal '48 Roadmaster convertible with four portholes on each side, with little amber lights in them. A GM styling honcho saw the car, liked the holes and gave the go-ahead to put them on production Buicks (without the lights) for 1949. The first year's holes were functional, allowing engine heat to escape; after that they became purely decorative, for various reasons supposedly including cases of inebriated passers-by urinating into them. The Ventiports first showed up for 1949, were seen on all Buicks through 1957, then went away for a couple years and returned on 1960 models.

""Cache"" is from the modern French meaning of ""cacher"": ""to hide""; ""cachet"" is from the Middle French meaning: ""to press"".

""A Shot In The Dark"" was filmed before ""The Pink Panther"", but released later.

During WW II, the Japanese deliberately infected prisoners with syphillis. At various points in the infection, they observed the effects on the body by vivisecting the prisoners - without anaesthetic. They did similar experiments with other diseases. The prisoners were mostly Chinese, although POWs (British, American, Canadian, Australian, Dutch and Indian) were also used. The US Biological Warfare program used conscientious objectors as guinea pigs. They were told only that they would be involved in low-risk medical experiments.

""My Fair Lady"" was a pun on the cockney pronunciation of ""Mayfair lady.""

Apophallation is a process wherein a slug eats its partner's penis following sexual intercourse. Autoapophallation has also been observed.

During a wartime visit to Moscow in 1942, Winston S. Churchill discovered a marvel of modern technology: hot and cold water flowing from the same faucet. The plumbing in the villa where he stayed as a guest of Stalin was unlike the primitive British standard of separate taps for hot and cold. Most bathroom sinks in Britain still have separate hot and cold taps today, years after Mr. Churchill's conversion and decades after nearly all dual taps were scrapped in the U.S. and most vanished from continental Europe.

Fully grown penguins generate pressures of around 10 kPa (77 mm Hg) to expel watery material and 60 kPa (450 mm Hg) to expel material of higher viscosity similar to that of olive oil. The forces involved, lying well above those known for humans, are high, but do not lead to an energetically wasteful turbulent flow. Whether a bird chooses the direction into which it decides to expel its faeces, and what role the wind plays in this, remain unknown.

At the US Mint a proof coin is struck multiple times from specially prepared (polished) dies and planchets (blanks) at higher pressure and lower speed than circulating coins. Current Mint products have deeply mirrored surfaces and frosted cameo effects on the designs; other kinds of effects are possible.

Planet Kevin is earthlike, except that it's so close to HD187123 that its year is only 3.097 days long.

The first St. Valentine was a priest in Rome, beheaded circa 269 A.D. on Feb. 14, and the second St. Valentine was a Bishop, living a few years later, who was beheaded at Terni, near Rome, also on Feb. 14, but not the same year. Neither should be confused with St. Valentine, an abbot and later a missionary bishop in Rhaetia, who died circa 450 A.D. His feast day is Jan. 7th.

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
Here's why:
Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.
Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

If you actually look at what's there, they're trying to tearing apart air.

First, the order is wrong. Which, in this context, is fucking crucial. 

Second, this was in a Q&amp;A and she basically backtracked herself at that point. 

So, it goes that she first mentions Russia and its hybrid warfare, then presents an example of *movements* which one knows don't come to people one by one individually. The part about ""suddenly hit on the idea"" - and movements forming. That's the parallel she draws. Yup. Cmon, the lady is chancellor for 14 years. You can be sure that she has an elaborate understanding of how internet changed protests and civil movements and its malicious usage. 

Then, your own statement is flat out wrong. ""That is a really important issue"" to ""welcoming that"" isn't quite a 180, is it? Somewhere between a 0 and 10, I'd say. In the same scope, really. It might also be worth listening for a short while after that, because she does seem to realize that it's a rather bad connection. She starts out, there are also other ""movements"" but she'd rather not get into the ones specific to Germany or other ones she views as positive. She instead gives Steven Bannon as an example of producing movements which are aimed against the EU model and *that* being something that we have to stand opposed to. In that regard, it's true that the climate movements are sandwiched in there. To constitute that she's speaking in the same tone or attributes the same ""roots"" to these things is just ignorant bs. 

I argued the same thing (in German) with providing better transcription and going further into it [in this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/ar9x8u/w%C3%A4hrenddessen_im_schulministerium_nrw/egmw5wv/) and you can [check the video here](https://youtu.be/77ldCeytas0?t=2520)

CPU speed is the biggest factor in how much load the server can handle (between player count and AI numbers, as well as how crazy you can get with mods and scripts).

So, it’s hard to know if Clark knew about this information. Although, those are possibly just his observations between the Cheyenne and the Arapaho at the time

&gt; Wurtzburg and Campbell (1995) propose that indigenous sign languages apparently started on the Gulf Coast and spread inland, following trade routes.

And what about when the changes in tax law that makes the blue states more fully own their expensive policies?

Or on trade and international relations. There is no doubt the EU NATO pay less than their fair share, and they also use their foreign aid and expertise/capacity to do advocacy foreign policy.  Is there a cut off on how hard and how much we press them to pay just because they are liberal democracies?  and what happens when their paying more NATO dues is reducing their international outreach? reducing their financing of micro loans? reducing their spending on tropical diseases? Is there a cut off to how much brinksmanship is applied on negotiating trade with China while making all kinds of gesture we want to contain their rise?  Is there a cut off how much we can intervene and press even close neighbors on the Americas continents in the here and now regardless of our past clandestine history?

commander_zoidberg,1480730422.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_139rbj,False,"I looked into it quite extensively even at that age. Nothing since has really changed my mind. My grandfathers were engineers, my father was an engineer. I work in engineering. I have probably been looking into it more and for a lot longer than you have. When you actually look into it the numbers don't add up. My dad was actually lead on a project for the company he worked for several years prior to reduce their emissions. Most of their options turned out to be non viable. Maybe in some places wind power might contribute some reasonable amounts of power in northern and coastal areas of Europe. Maybe in a few desert regions solar works pretty well. Last time i checked there are no deserts in Europe. Maybe it might be viable in Southern Spain or Southern Italy. Even then you would sky rocket electrical prices and likely you would have to import fossil electricity via the grid at night at significant transmission losses.  

Offshore wind for example. It's ridiculously carbon intensive and capital intensive to build offshore wind farms. It requires hundreds to thousands of tons of concrete to anchor the turbines. The turbines only generate when the wind blows. They have a limited life span. Lighting strikes regularly take out wind turbines as well. Plus given how remote they are there are significant transmission losses - around 1% per mile. Not to mention a misapplication of capital. Putting HV transmission lines to remote corners of the country to transmit to the grid at significant losses and then only operating them half the time?

Then there is the side of renewable energy you also don't understand. The grid has to plan accordingly and be able to respond to changes in load. Wind is unpredictable. The sun shines infrequently and only for a few hours a day in winter. Some ignorant humanities student like you sees a wind turbine spinning and sees magic green pixies. What you don't realise is that the grid might not need that power due to the time of day. Secondly the national grid is paying significant amounts of money to fossil stations to keep their boilers fired and turbines spinning. You see little one it takes anywhere from 12 hours to several days to power up a nuclear reactor or fire the boilers at a coal station and raise enough steam to spin the turbines up. It isn't like starting your Prius. If there is a lull in the wind it would cause rolling black outs so they have to be ready to respond in seconds. 

Some countries are blessed with hydro electric like Canada or Norway. Countries are spending big on hydroelectric. Thing is they aren't as clean as they would make you believe. These do produce emissions when organic matter in the flooded landscapes rots. Changes in land use contribute significantly to emissions. 

Don't get me started on ethanol or bio diesel. 

Or the palm oil destroying the rain forests. 

Hydrogen cars are also stupid. I'll explain that to you if you can't work that out.

All this also took place alongside a codification of the relationship that kings legally had with their vassals, which is why you see things such as coronations oaths promising that the king must respect laws, liberties and customs, or things like the Magna Carta or Golden Bull, which really doesn’t square with the idea of a divine right of kings which is properly an early modern concept more than a medieval one.

The other side of this coin is that vassalage and the autonomy of lords is more complicated than you’re portraying it; it wasn’t just a static situation where the lords were powerful landowners when acting in concert but not very independent. Ignoring the fact that vassalage worked very differently from country to county (e.g. France had far more sub-infeudation than England, where all the barons where directly subject to the king regardless of their holdings’ size), the power of vassals was something that hugely changed over time, from a general breakdown of royal authority and royal control over land in the early Middle Ages called the Feudal Revolution (including the usurpation of judicial authority, which Anglo-Saxon England was unusual for *not* experiencing). French kings until the 1200s were so weak that they couldn’t really be described as more than the first among equals of the French dukes as the princes of Paris, and becoming the powerful absolute monarchs of early modern France was something they only achieved through centuries of difficult military and cultural effort and by no means a foregone conclusion. I don’t know much about the relationship between royal officials like sheriffs and local nobles outside of Saxon and Norman England, but I can say that there most courts were closer to outdoor assemblies of local dignitaries chaired by royal officials (usually), and the fact that Louis XIV’s introduction of intendants was considered a great expansion of his power vs the nobility (in the 1600s) suggests that they weren’t all that prominent on the continent either.

Papal power relative to monarchs was also something that constantly waxed and waned, and was basically something they had to constantly fight with the crowned heads over just to maintain. There’s a convincing argument to be made that many medieval heresies were ‘created’ by the roman church expanding its power and narrowing the definition of orthodox, and discovering that lots of people held un-orthodox views in the process: there were long periods of time where they didn’t or couldn’t deal with the pretty big variation of beliefs within Christianity.

I’m not saying that you’re painting a wrong picture of medieval Europe, but it is a pretty specifically late-medieval one (which admittedly I know less about) when in fact kingship, feudalism and religious influence were all in constant contention over time and changed relative to political and geographical factors as well. I think you’re complaints about it not being true to life can be answered by saying that if you look at the earlier Middle Ages, it fits far better.

And I’m not saying that you’re wrong that GRRM paints a pretty un-nuanced picture of the Middle Ages though, he basically ignores the way medieval feudal societies existed in the context of centuries of change and social conflict and explains almost all the disagreements with reference to individual nobles disagreeing and takes the shape of society for granted. The idea that such an enormous kingdom could exist feudally at all is super dubious, the way that the seven kingdoms existed for hundred (or even thousands) of years with no more change in their society and politics than some shifting borders is completely ridiculous, and other people who know more about geography can demonstrate better than I can that Westeros makes no sense as a place where people live. To give him some credit I will say he thinks more about how his imaginary society would affect the people who live in it than you might expect from fantasy authors so it does have some decent verisimilitude.

This is a  prominent theme in JP's stuff. 

Knowledge in itself can never be violent against anyone. Knowledge can be instrumentalized in a negative way to rationalize hateful positions, but that's not a result of knowledge **production** and to claim it is so is ridiculous. I could provide the example of intersectionality being used to generate resentment and hatred against whites and males, but that example isn't accurate: intersectionality is ideology, not knowledge.

&gt;  
&gt;What knowledge?

&gt;  
&gt;What/who gets priviledge?  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Are  you not taking these questions seriously? What about these questions  seem ideologically driven to you? They certainly question the entrenched  (presumably white/european) ideology and epistemology.

These questions are ideological, yes. They presume that science is biased just because it was predominantly white/European, or that because a white person finds out something about the world, then that knowledge belongs to ""white people"" rather than to all human beings. That's based on a relativist ideology that makes no sense. Science provides an objective means to test theories to see how representative they are of the world through experimentation, knowledge that it produces doesn't belong to anyone, or rather it belongs to everyone, because we are existing in one world with the same natural rules for everyone.

&gt; Lastly, why not exercise your critical thinking abilities and try to  answer these questions yourself? Are South African knowledge and  episemologies simply not worth talking about? 

There is no such thing as ""South African"" knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge. Science is an attempt at providing an objective method to find out what is true and what is not. A lot of European traditional theories about the world were disproved by science during the Enlightenment and afterwards. You can't pretend that African traditional theories about the world are equivalent to theories that have weathered the test of the scientific method. Put these theories to the test too, maybe some of them are demonstrably true, and then they can join the sum of all we know about the world.

I'm using the UN defintion which is the most used I have seen.

As you can see they're pretty vague and open to interpretation. Hell under it you could classify a hate crime as gennocide. Ukraine isn't debatable in the West as it is pretty clear that Stalin ordered with the full knowledge of what would happen and condoned after the famine went into full effect.  

The Indian Wars are more aptly classified as Total War. Since when one of the Indian tribes or nations went to war their entire population contributed to the war effort, and especially in the period after the Civil War when Union generals like Sheridan and Sherman used the lessons they learned in the Civil War aganist the Indian tribes. They went to war with the goal of total victory, and if you classify total war as gennocide then you have to classify what the Allies did to the Axis powers as gennocide in the air campaigns aganist Germany and Japan. 

Was their terrible war crimes committed by the US and the British during the Colonial era. Yes, but there was also plenty of war crimes committed by the various Indian tribes as they sacked many colonial towns and villages as that was the way war was fought in North America for millennia before the arrival of the Europeans.

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"It's a ""problem"" with fantasy in general. I put problem in quotes because some would argue it's part of the appeal. But traditional fantasy usually features strong good people defending weak good people. That inherently tends toward an imperialistic/authoritarian setting.

On top of that, the classic DnD setting is euro-centric medieval. This brings some cultural baggage to the table. Dwarves are Scottish and human's are a mish-mash of British stereotypes. But you ever notice how cultures in the jungle are always primitive? Or how desert-dwellers are usually savages?

Obviously not every campaign falls into these stereotypes, but it is something to keep in mind. Personally, I like playing with those expectations in the game I run so I'll put my players in situations where there isn't a clear good side or they butt heads with the powers that be despite everyone being ""good"". And maybe the races and cultures that usually represent evil or primitive ways are more advanced than the European analogues?

Like you said, ""it's a fantasy world"" isn't an excuse to be lazy. It's the opposite. Fantasy is about imagination, but we keep going back to the same cliches. If anything is possible, why aren't there more Wakandas? It's not like we don't already alter historical precedent in the name of fun.

Absolutely. But it was definitely a contributing factor, though.

&gt;The French intelligently stepped in and courted Russia and Britain

Yes, because having allies is pretty important. Those alliances would only be invoked in the event of a defensive war, though - which is what happened.

&gt;The non-renewal of the Russian alliance wasn’t dictated by desire for war against France, or at all. Afair it was due to tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary.

Over the Balkans, yes, even though Bismark offered a solution where both nations would have their own spheres of influence in the region. And even after the League of the Three Emperors dissolved, Bismark managed to patch up a limited treaty with the Russians - the [Reinsurance Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance_Treaty). Needless to say, it too was not renewed after Bismark was fired by Wilhelm II.

&gt;And while the Germans did declare war against France first, they were the last of the major belligerents, excluding Britain, to actually mobilize their Army.

All of the timelines I've seen of events leading up to the declaration of war have Russia partially mobilising first and Germany and France starting mobilisation on the same day (1 August)^1

&gt;Which, I think it’s also worth mentioning, was smaller as a proportion of population to the French and Russian armies.

Given that the German population in 1914 (68 million) was over half again that of France (40 million), they could field more men for the same percentage of the population. As for Russia, their standing military at the start of the war was [1.5 million compared to Germany's 1.9 million](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I/Forces-and-resources-of-the-combatant-nations-in-1914), which is actually a smaller percentage of the population than Germany's army.

&gt; Massive Attack are a trip-hop group which formed in Bristol, England in 1988. The group currently consists of Robert ""3D"" Del Naja and Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall. Third member Andy ""Mushroom"" Vowles left the group in 1999. The band has released five studio albums: ""Blue Lines"" (1991), ""Protection"" (1994), ""Mezzanine"" (1998), ""100th Window"" (2003), and ""Heligoland"" (2010). On 28 January 2016, Massive Attack released a new EP, Ritual Spirit, followed by The Spoils in July.

&gt; The group are considered to be progenitors of the trip hop genre. Their debut album, Blue Lines was released in 1991, with the single ""Unfinished Sympathy"" reaching the charts and later being voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by The Guardian. 1998's Mezzanine, containing ""Teardrop"", and 2003's 100th Window charted in the UK at number 1. Both Blue Lines and Mezzanine feature in Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including a Brit Award—winning Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards They have released 5 studio albums that have sold over 11 million copies worldwide.

&gt; In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003/4. The two later worked together again in the 2008 Damon Albarn sessions for the fifth proper studio album.

Landon is not the driving force behind fascism, the player, Pelley and other demagogues are, Landon is simply swept up by events. 
Most people will also oust him in favour of MacArthur once the civil war fires further reinforcing that he was nothing but a puppet or a means to an end and if you look at the disastrous 1936 election then Landon never did anything by himself, everything was coordinated centrally by the Republican party using Landon as a face for policies that the party wanted to implement.

Sure, I suppose, since he established the office that would later be used to order the Indian removal. Most of the genocide occurred prior to that revolution, though. Indian removal in America was popular among the Demos at the time as well. 


&gt;Also Lenin was against Stalin taking over, wanted the one party state to be temporary. Look up the NEP if you think he’s an uncompromising utopian totalitarian.

What did he think would happen with that level of control concentrated in his party? What kind of safeguards were ever in place to prevent his usurping besides intra-party trust and consensus? It was a pretty substantial concentration of power in a single party government. 

&gt;- I disagree. How is Stalin any different than Napoleon? Both killed million in for the sake of egos. 

But one was actually called an Emperor while aspiring to be one. He lacked the ability to control his own population as tightly as Stalin and faced a different set of opponents than Stalin did centuries later. Stalin wasn't fighting a gang of monarchs, he was largely fighting his own supposedly Democratic people and competing Capitalist Oriented Democracies. 


&gt;- Also “Marxist style revolutions” do you fucking know what Marx thought was necessary before a socialist revolution? Industrialized capital. PLEASE Read before you wanna denounce a thinker and the robust ideology he inspired. 

Why would it actually matter that Marx thought society required some certain objective stage before a revolution? The rest of his philosophy was easily adapted and the vocabulary transferred over and taught to new adherents outside of Europe. Instead of opposing the Bourgeoisie at the center of Europe, they opposed its colonial vestiges abroad and always spoke of conquering and uniting the proletariat of the European continent. 


&gt;- Those were state apparatuses being reproduced by ideology. 

Great, Marxism has its own character when it becomes the State ideology as well. 

&gt;- Marxist Leninism is Stalinism, I don’t see Marx or really Lenin as personally responsible for any of Stalins egoism or its brutal reproduction in other countries.

Aren't all the building blocks for resentment based on differing economic status still there? He gave it a very compelling language that makes organizing a class rebellion easier and more likely. 


&gt;Why lay all this shit on Marx especially when the greatest and most correct critics of Soviet socialism were Marxists(most were Leninists).

Because it's the ethos of his work. Obviously he's not the only person who produced compelling philosophical accounts of human relations and human destiny in his era,  and many of his contemporaries would inspire competing movements, but his ideas were endlessly adapted to justify the repressive single party States that arose in the 20th century. That's a distinct characteristic of Marxism in practice.

An appeal raising funds to create a visitor centre dedicated to Baroness Thatcher has instead spent much of its fortune encouraging young people to support right-wing beliefs.

The Tory MP Conor Burns is under scrutiny by the Charity Commission over his involvement in the British wing of a transatlantic campaign that was supposed to build a museum and library devoted to the former prime minister.

An investigation by The Times has found that most donations to the Margaret Thatcher Centre’s US fundraising vehicle came from the billionaire Robert Mercer, President Trump’s top donor. He set up Cambridge Analytica, the consulting company that controversially became involved in data mining, and bankrolled Steve Bannon, the alt-right activist.


It can also be revealed that, after a public appeal in Britain for money to buy Thatcher’s outfits, Mr Burns and another trustee bid at a Christie’s auction to buy them for a private collector. A solicitor with expertise in charities said that he expected the Charity Commission “would take a dim view” of the apparent conflict of interest.

The Margaret Thatcher Centre, due to open this year to mark the 40th anniversary of her becoming prime minister and 60 years since she was elected to parliament, has made little progress. Leading Conservatives, including Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and politicians from around the world have supported the cause but there is nothing concrete to show for it.

Ben Elliot, a nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, was a founding trustee of the British branch of the appeal. Mr Elliot, who is the government’s newly appointed food waste tsar, said that he had stepped down because of its “failure to achieve its original goals”.

An early ambition to build the centre at Westminster was eventually ditched in favour of the more modest location of the University of Buckingham, where Thatcher served as chancellor. A spokeswoman for the university said that there had been talks but the centre was unlikely to open this year. Accounts show that nearly all the money raised for the centre on both sides of the Atlantic has been spent.

Instead of being used to create a library and museum, money donated in America was poured into student exchanges between Britain and the US to promote the “Anglosphere”, including a visit by American students to the conservative Freedom Association’s conference in Bournemouth. A donation was also given to a John Wilkes Centre in London, named after the 18th-century radical reformer.

The annual “London scholars programme” for students includes sightseeing to Cambridge or Oxford, private policy briefings on Brexit and the Anglo-American special relationship, and a drinks reception at the Gherkin, the skyscraper in the City of London. British students go to Marymount, a politically neutral Catholic university in Washington.

The US-based Cherish Freedom Foundation raised more than $1 million in five years but nearly all of it has gone on student exchanges. Fundraising in Britain has been carried out by the Cherish Freedom Trust, created during the days between Thatcher’s death and her funeral in May 2013. Its accounts show it raised £300,000 in two years but spent most of this on events, consultants, professional fees and travel.

The trust gained charitable status in 2014. However, the Charity Commission is understood to have taken the unusual step of seeking and receiving detailed assurances regarding its independence. Regulatory sources said that any evidence of this principle not being properly upheld would be of serious concern.

Gary Rycroft, a solicitor and expert on the legal affairs of charities, said that it sounded like the charity “was on their radar from the word go”. He said it seemed that the commission had “flagged it during the registration process as a concern and therefore sought particular assurances that they wouldn’t normally seek”.

Based in Kent and London, the Cherish Freedom Trust had personal and corporate connections with right-wing and business interests. In an article for Breitbart, the news website heavily funded by Mr Mercer, the US-based Cherish Freedom Foundation said that its transatlantic programmes were aimed at “spreading conservatism in Britain and Europe”.

Charities in England are forbidden from having a political purpose. Mr Burns once reported Oxfam to the Charity Commission for attacking the government’s austerity programme.

The Cherish Freedom Trust’s remaining trustees are Mr Burns and a company, also called Cherish Freedom, whose director is Mr Burns.

The commission said last night: “Concerns have been raised with us about the Cherish Freedom Trust. We are currently assessing information relating to the charity and the trustees’ legal duties and responsibilities to protect the charity’s independence and manage any conflicts of interest. If we identify serious regulatory issues, we will take the matter forward.”

The Margaret Thatcher Centre said: “The centre still runs programmes on both sides of the Atlantic while continuing to secure pledges to enable a permanent facility to be opened in due course.”

Mr Elliot said that the project had “huge ambitions and unfortunately for a number of reasons it didn’t succeed. It was just a story of something that could have been brilliant and sadly wasn’t.”

Got a great group of friends that I have met in game and we do m+ regularly. Here I am trying to expand the network to find bunch of friendly and fun people to befriend and raid with.

I usually get online around 20 server time and can play for 3ish hours. Flexible with the role which to play. I play both monk and paladin so can do anything they can.

Not interested in huge groups where everyone is just another name on the screen. My raging and flaming tolerance is zero, those don't benefit anyone in any way.

kaik1914,1487056592.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_15dxkt,False,"Syndicalism was never a strong movement in Czechoslovakia with its very powerful left oriented outlook. The industrial working class had very little ""Estate Pride"", which mean that the majority of the events from the late 19th century till modern era happened outside the control of the proletariat. The communists attempted to minimize a role of the workers in the decision making process within the factories. The interwar republic was bourgeoisie invention, and the blue collars did not create it nor defended when the Nazis took it over. Blue collars were used by the communists to achieve a power in 1948 and immediately isolated, so the communist intellectuals could run, execute each other, and control the country. The anti-Stalinist and anti-communist movement was almost an intellectual movement unlike in Poland or Hungary. Leninism had a very deep influence over the Czech and Slovak societies. However, almost nobody reads him, but communists gave a false hope to the masses after the war, that they will live in a worker's paradise. When this has not materialized by 1960, the communist system weakened, and have to to reintroduce on by the power of the Soviet tanks in the 1968.    

The Liberalism is a broad subject. In Czechia, the country is fairly liberal as it is a secular country. The secularism is an outcome of the National Awakening, which happened outside organized religion in the 19th century, and the Czechs did not have any church or religion to associate. The liberalism there could be divided into two streams, one is typical western European, multi-culti, tree hugging group, most from the large cities like Prague and Brno. Other liberalism is purely business and economically oriented group admiring laissez faire capitalism, and Anglo-Saxon economic and political system. This group is represented by a newly wealthy, middle class population.  Both movements are deeply secular, but one is pro-European looking, and other is inward, pro-isolationist.

2ndHandTardis,1410162698.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_iasek,False,"This still a very Federation way of looking at the issue - which is the problem for people like T'Kuvma. Klingons are an aggressive, militaristic and traditional society. What the Federation considers to be conventional for society and interstellar diplomacy is radically different in the Empire.

Despite early contact with the Klingons at the beginning of Discovery we're seeing Federation in the early stages of a diplomatic relationship with the Klingons which will evolve.

The incident which resulted in the Battle of the Binary Stars is the result of a cultural clash based in ignorance with a dash of naivety on **both** sides. It's easy to point to the Klingons as the aggressors but remember we're dealing with a culture were aggression is the norm and they view interactions on those terms, even diplomatic overtures. The Federation was ignorant and ill-prepared to deal with the Klingons.

Part of the problem with the Federation is it's a society which views itself and it's actions as generally benevolent but they seem to rarely consider what effect their expansion must have on adjacent species. Look at all the conflicts the Federation has had over the years Klingons, Cardassians, Dominion, Talarians, Romulans (Coalition of Planets). The core of all these issues is the expansion of the Federation and the apparent threat to their culture.

I don't think T'Kuvma's actions were justified but I understand him. I view him similarly to Native American chieftains (or leaders general) rather than a generic fanatic. He acted very similarly to how some tribes responded to European settlers and later the USA. To them the very presence of the foreign settlers was a threat to their way of life and thus their actions (expansion in particular) can be seen as an act of aggression.

While extreme that was T'Kuvma's point and one the Federation over the centuries seems to push aside. If you try to view it from other species  then you can understand why some might see it as insidious.

In fact this quote from Eddington to Sisko about the Maquis speaks to that.

*""I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed with the Maquis? We've never harmed you. And yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You know, in some ways you're even worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation.*

*You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't""*

It clearly was manufactured and T'Kuvma had a variety of goals (uniting the houses) but at it's core is still the cultural clash. That was real and it's something which exists still in the 24th century.

British agriculture, along with all EU farming, is heavily protected from competition. This is achieved through a mixture of trade controls - tariffs and quotas - regulatory requirements that exporter nations cannot match or even demonstrate and, of course, plain old subsidy. 

Britain is, however, most probably on the point of leaving the EU, but without any clarity whatsoever as to what follows. British agriculture will be exposed to unknown regimes, including - much sought by the ERG group, with its enthusiasm for the free trade of the 1830s - a zero tariff environment. Under such a regime food prices will fall by about 10% but most farms - all hill farming, pretty much everything except intensive cereals on excellent land - will go broke. The average UK farm made just £20 thousand net last year. 

A sensible extension to this would be to cut tariffs but raise taxes in order to subsidise land custodianship"", which is to say policy which pays farmers to maintain biodiversity, to generate a beautiful countryside and to offer public access to land. Many farmers see this as nationalisation by the back door, with ""government inspectors"" defining their entire range of choice. Non-farmers wonder whether house building or alternative uses might not be sensible, at least in areas under population pressure.

The Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture towards the UK on post-Brexit trade talks, demanding greater access to the UK market for its agricultural products and guarantees that London would not manipulate its currency.

The office of the US trade representative, led by Robert Lighthizer, on Thursday released its “negotiating objectives” for a possible trade agreement with the UK, suggesting Britain is unlikely to get softer treatment than other US allies.

In the 18-page document, Mr Lighthizer’s office said it was seeking “comprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK” through the reduction or elimination of tariffs, a request that has already soured Washington’s trade relations with the EU.

Furthermore, the US is looking for the UK to remove “unwarranted barriers” related to “sanitary and physiosanitary” standards in the farm industry. For years US agricultural groups have complained that European countries have unnecessarily limited American exports of meat and grains based on fears they are unsafe for consumers.

Access to the British agricultural market could end up being the most politically sensitive request made by the Trump administration. The EU has said it was not willing to include agriculture in its own trade negotiations with the US, given that it could trigger a big public backlash in a wide range of member states.

Other demands could also be highly problematic for London. On currency, the US wants to “ensure that the UK avoids manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage”. Currency matters have traditionally been excluded from trade negotiations, but the Trump administration has injected them into talks, including with China and Japan.

Another provision that could raise eyebrows would constrain the UK’s ability to secure a trade deal with a “non-market economy” — such as China — by creating a “mechanism to ensure transparency and take appropriate action”. This could allow the US to ditch its trade deal with the UK if it does not like the terms of any agreement London strikes with Beijing.

The tough US demands are only an opening gambit, but they highlight the difficulties the UK could face in negotiating a trade deal with Washington, in contrast to claims made by leading Brexit proponents that it would be a smooth exercise.

On Thursday a UK government spokesperson said negotiating an “ambitious free trade agreement” with the US was a priority and Washington’s move to publish its objectives “demonstrates their commitment to beginning talks as soon as possible”.

She added: “As part of our open and transparent approach to negotiations, we will publish our own negotiating objectives in due course.”

The US negotiating objectives for the UK deal are similar to the wish lists published in recent months by Mr Lighthizer’s office for talks with the EU and Japan.

On industrial goods, the US said it was aiming for “comprehensive duty-free access” and stronger “disciplines to address non-tariff barriers” from the UK.

In digital trade, which is rapidly expanding, the US wants “secure commitments not to impose customs duties on digital products”, such as software, music, video and ebooks, and “non-discriminatory treatment” of content.

In commercial partnerships, the US is asking the UK to “discourage politically motivated actions to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel”.",True,False,False,,0,1551605984,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehovcie,True,t3_awsjkl,True,t3_awsjkl,/r/brealism/comments/awsjkl/us_takes_tough_line_with_uk_on_postbrexit_trade/ehovcie/,False,,1555387041,2,True,False,brealism,t5_3f9cs,r/brealism,public,

However, the problems that were either caused by, or blamed on, our membership of the EU wouldn't disappear; they'd just be different. The people agitating for us to leave the EU would be agitating for us to re-negotiate whatever deal we had with the EU from the outside, using very similar campaigning methods. The only way things would be meaningfully different is if we had never started the process of integration with the EU economy in the first place, but that would have meant we'd be worse off. When the option of joining the EU would have always been on the table, I don't think there are many realistic alternative histories where we didn't join at some point anyway if we hadn't in 1973. The industrial decline and shift to services work we saw in the post-war period would have happened anyway. We would have lost the mines and the factories just the same, but we would have been less likely to get the sorts of new factories (like NMUK in Sunderland) which were sustainable for the future.

Brexit would have been an entirely legitimate process if the UK had decided in a referendum to go for a realistic option, the likes of which the EU could have even accepted in advance. That is, Cameron could have agreed the outline of any Article 50 negotiation ahead of time, so the referendum would have been based on something like the Withdrawal Agreement that we have now, including the Irish backstop and other contentious issues. The reason we didn't do that is because Brexit was never meant to happen, as it was simply a party management process gone wrong. The UK had no intention to leave. Cameron blocked the Remain campaign from doing what it needed to do, because he thought winning was in the bag and he didn't want to make life harder post-referendum to bring the warring sides of the Tory party back together after a more acrimonious referendum campaign. In any case, the Brexiteer side wouldn't have ever accepted that referendum as legitimate anyway, as it would have 1. denied them the unicorn option they desire and 2. would have certainly resulted in a Remain vote.

The fact that UK politicians can make a living saying that we can get away with fucking over the rest of the EU27 is testament to the fact the UK electorate and body politic simply does not understand the UK's true position in the world. Brexiteer politicians simply couldn't exist in most other countries in Europe, since most other countries in Europe understand full well what happens when they try to fuck over other countries nearby.

&gt;Like a lot of things in life – football, journalism and parenting spring to mind – government is quite easy to do, but quite difficult to do well. And it’s very difficult to do well consistently.

&gt;In a complex society with competitive, democratic politics and demanding popular expectations of what government can and should do for people, it must sometimes seem impossible.

&gt;If you talk to anyone who has worked in government, in a political or official capacity, you understand pretty quickly that a lot of government is not a Platonic inquiry into achieving the greatest good for the greatest number, but rather a frantic, pressurised choice between two unpleasant alternatives.

&gt;And sometimes they make it harder for themselves. In recent times we have seen several examples of where poor management by this administration has led to those alternatives being more unpleasant, and those choices being more pressurised.

&gt;Take two recent examples: the children’s hospital and the open question on the national broadband plan.

&gt;Last November, the Government was confronted with a disagreeable choice: proceed with the massively expensive project, or abandon it and start again. It was a classic government lesser-of-two-evils choice. But its roots lay in the failure to manage the escalating cost over the previous two years. In politics, such chickens tend to come home to roost at inconvenient times.

&gt;_Political pain_

&gt;The Government is facing a similar choice on the national broadband plan, whose escalating costs were finally confirmed by the Taoiseach this week as amounting to “many multiples” of the original half a billion euro price tag. Having inexplicably not availed of the opportunity to restart the project last autumn after it was revealed that the then minister for communications Denis Naughten was in the habit of breaking bread with the sole bidder David McCourt, the Government must now decide whether to pay up, or stop the wedding. Either way, a world of political pain awaits.


&gt;A very big choice now faced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the small group of people who make the decisions for the country’s future is whether they should compromise on the backstop in order to provide the British with the cover they need to pass the withdrawal treaty in the House of Commons, and so avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit.

&gt;There are downsides either way: weakening the backstop involves not just risk for the country but would represent a climbdown by Varadkar and his Tánaiste Simon Coveney – the men who brought you the bulletproof backstop. But not compromising means the British will not pass the withdrawal agreement and though the prospect of a no-deal Brexit receded this week (the most significant week at Westminster since December), such is the febrility of British politics that no outcome can be ruled out with certainty.

&gt;It is becoming accepted at the top of Government that some sort of a move on the backstop is sensible.

&gt;This is not just because it could secure a good outcome for everyone – Ireland, the UK and the European Union – but because it would avoid the possibility of a much more acutely unpleasant choice in the future: the choice, in a no-deal scenario, whether to have checks on goods at the Border, or between Ireland and the EU.

&gt;Once the choice to compromise on the backstop is made – not yet, but soon, I expect – this all becomes a matter of choreography and substance, or to put it in the words of one person participating in these matters, question of “the what and the when”.

&gt;The “what”, or the substance, is a question of the exact nature of the change to the backstop – a protocol or codicil to the treaty (the British preference) which puts EU promises on the temporary nature of the backstop into legal commitments that could be ultimately justiciable, or some sort of standalone declaration (the Irish suggestion) which amounts to the same thing but in softer terms.

&gt;The EU and the Irish will not undermine the backstop, but they will try to make it more palatable for the British. The British, for their part, must get some concession which changes it.

&gt;The substance of these matters is not yet resolved, but both sides know what they have to do.

&gt;_Choreography_

&gt;The “when”, or the choreography, is perhaps even more delicate. But it runs something like this: a draft text is agreed between the UK and the European Commission; British attorney general Geoffrey Cox pronounces that the backstop has changed and that on balance the UK will not be held against its will indefinitely in the backstop; fortified, the DUP acquiesces, thus unlocking most Conservative Brexiteer votes, and the House of Commons passes the deal; the European Council (ie, meeting of EU leaders) on March 21st-22nd endorses the deal; and the following week, in advance of the March 29th deadline, the European Parliament ratifies. After that, the British may require a short extension to pass relevant legislation, but then they’re out, with a deal. Phew.

&gt;Few observers evince overwhelming confidence that it will all come off as described. It requires a number of people to make leaps of faith and judgment. It requires difficult choices.

&gt;Significant doubts remain about the British government’s ability to manage its own affairs – something it has been conspicuously unable to do so far. But the visit of David Lidington, Theresa May’s effective deputy, to Dublin on Thursday was intended to offer reassurances on that point – and to request that Coveney and Varadkar don’t say anything which would undermine the British government’s ability to sell any eventual compromise. That suggests a degree of purpose and confidence not evident so far in Downing Street.

Unii parca locuiesc intr-un vid in afara serviciului, nu stiu ce se afla in jur, nu urmaresc politica, un meci de fotbal, subiectele de actualitate, nu au un hobby, un domeniu de interes, ceva acolo.

Mai e nevoia de readaptare continua. Apar constant tehnologii noi, limbaje noi, metode noi de lucru, etc. Nu e ca in unele meserii unde inveti unele lucruri si alea le repeti pana la pensie.

&gt;Why do you believe German car makers would produce unreliable electric motors?

Already told ya, they will over engineer it.  

&gt;This is verifiably false you know that right?

Even though its not.  It's much easier to fix a classic car than a modern one primary due to the fact you won't need a special computer to diagnose the engine.  And that everything is much more basic and simple unlike modern cars. 

&gt;Are you using ""truck"" to only mean ""pickup truck""?

Yes, and most people in the US take it to mean pickup truck not just any big car including SUV's.  Also you do realize your link is to some European music video right?  As no one in the US refers the G Wagon as being the Benz Truck.  I wager most people in the US least younger people have no clue what a station wagon is as they largely been stop being a thing in the US for quite some time.

You brought up the Tesla truck...  And your right no one will buy a VW truck as last I check they don't make trucks and more so Ford, GM and Toyota are the establish truck companies.  No one in the US will buy a European truck.  Only European thing US will buy is luxury cars and sports cars besides exotic cars (ie Lambos).

If the meat meets (sorry!) existing regulations, then there is no problem with it being imported. The debate is about meat which doesn't meet our regulations and which therefore is currently banned.

In regards to your other comment, chlorination is used as a surface slime remover. It's not a recommended/standard practice, but none-the-less it is a practice that occurs because chlorination is allowed. And since chlorination is an allowed practice, you can't separate out the farmers that are using it for this purpose.

What's annoying is that Woody Johnson's comments are ill-informed and insulting. He says the EU is behind, where as in fact we are actually ahead. We have mandatory vaccination in the industry - the US doesn't. It's a much more advanced and targeted technique than just dowsing birds in chlorinated water. Our animal welfare standards are higher too, which again obviates the need to do this.

 Tinha medo de estar com uma doenÃ§a maligna na garganta, tamanha a dor ao engolir que se instalara havia uma semana. Era uma amigdalite purulenta que tratei com antibiÃ³tico.

 Desde entÃ£o, abria um sorriso que iluminava o rosto quando nos cumprimentÃ¡vamos, ao cruzar na galeria. Nosso relacionamento ficou limitado a esses encontros ocasionais atÃ© a Ãºltima segunda-feira, quando retornou com um nÃ³dulo no seio.

 Perguntei hÃ¡ quanto tempo estava na penitenciÃ¡ria.

 â Cinco anos desta vez.

 â E das outras?

 â Foram duas passagens, sem contar as da Febem.

 â CondenaÃ§Ãµes longas como esta?

 â NÃ£o. A maior foi de trÃªs anos. Cadeias de poeta, como dizem por aqui.

Mila nasceu numa das comunidades mais pobres da BrasilÃ¢ndia, zona norte de SÃ£o Paulo. Morava num quarto e cozinha com a mÃ£e, faxineira, dois irmÃ£os mais novos e o padrasto, seguranÃ§a de um mercadinho.

 No dia em que completou dez anos, foi estuprada pelo padrasto que ameaÃ§ou matÃ¡-la se contasse para a mÃ£e. Ao ser violentada pela segunda vez, fez uma trouxa com as roupas e fugiu de casa. Antes de sair pela porta em disparada, no entanto, teve o cuidado de rachar a cabeÃ§a do agressor com um pedaÃ§o de cano que o atingiu Ã traiÃ§Ã£o, junto Ã pia.

 Com o dinheiro surrupiado da carteira do pedÃ³filo, pegou um Ã´nibus para a praÃ§a da SÃ©, o lugar mais distante de que ouvira falar:

 â O primo de um menino da escola tinha fugido para lÃ¡.

 Com a sabedoria dos dez anos, foi viver por conta prÃ³pria com os menores que passavam os dias e as noites nas imediaÃ§Ãµes da praÃ§a. 

 LÃ¡, conheceu Dora, menina de 14 anos que a adotou como filha:

 â Foi minha mÃ£e de rua, me acolheu e protegeu. Se alguÃ©m vinha com maldade para o meu lado, ela virava o cÃ£o. Furou com estilete a barriga de um moleque mais velho que tentou me pegar Ã forÃ§a. Deu uma bofetada na cara do portuguÃªs da lanchonete, que perguntou quanto ela queria para me mandar fazer um programa com ele.

 Com Dora, dividia as quentinhas fornecidas pelos donos de bares e restaurantes, compadecidos com a sorte daquela menina magrinha de olhar inquieto. O dinheiro para as demais necessidades vinha da habilidade da parceira no furto de mercadorias, enquanto Mila vigiava na porta da loja, atividade responsÃ¡vel pelas internaÃ§Ãµes na antiga Febem.

 Dora foi firme na educaÃ§Ã£o da filha:

 â Gente como nÃ³s, comeÃ§a cheirando cola. Quando vÃª, estÃ¡ jogada feito escrava no meio da cracolÃ¢ndia. VocÃª e eu nÃ£o, nosso futuro vai ser diferente porque temos uma Ã outra.

 Mais tarde, conheceram um distribuidor de dinheiro falso que as empregou como entregadoras. Alugaram um quarto na rua HelvÃ©tia; as despesas extras pagavam com os furtos que lhe renderam a primeira das cadeias de poeta, mal atingida a maioridade.

 Aos 23 anos, conheceu, se apaixonou e foi viver com PlatÃ£o, filho do dono de um ""poupatempo"", escritÃ³rio especializado na falsificaÃ§Ã£o de documentos. Insistiu com Dora para morar com eles, mas a amiga recusou.

 Trabalhou com o companheiro e o sogro durante cinco anos, perÃ­odo em que aprendeu a arte da falsificaÃ§Ã£o e deu Ã luz a um casal de gÃªmeos.

 â Foi o perÃ­odo mais feliz da minha vida.

 A felicidade foi interrompida pelos disparos de dois motoqueiros contra pai e filho, num ponto de Ã´nibus.

 ViÃºva, com duas crianÃ§as, Mila assumiu o ""poupatempo"" e a clientela do sogro. Emitia carteira de identidade e de motorista, CPF, atestado de antecedentes, certidÃµes negativas, escrituras de imÃ³veis e recibos de pagamentos jamais efetuados.

 â Os clientes elogiavam a perfeiÃ§Ã£o dos meus documentos. Coloco uma carteira de identidade verdadeira ao lado da que eu faÃ§o, o senhor nÃ£o percebe a diferenÃ§a.

 Nunca mais namorou nem saiu para se divertir sem os filhos, viveu para o trabalho e a famÃ­lia. Hoje, sente orgulho:

 â A menina estuda na USP, o menino faz engenharia numa faculdade particular. NÃ£o fumam, nunca usaram droga nem chegaram perto de uma delegacia.

 AlÃ©m da casa em que vivem, cada um Ã© proprietÃ¡rio de dois imÃ³veis de aluguel. Tudo legalizado, com escrituras oficiais assinadas em cartÃ³rio.

 Quando fala de suas origens e do que fez pela famÃ­lia, ela sorri.

Yes we did. Welsh orthography developed from Latin in parallel with English and many other European languages. Welsh (which could barely be said to have diverged from Brythonic at the time) was being written down as early as the 6th and 7th centuries, probably following on from an earlier Brythonic literary tradition that is now lost to us. In fact Welsh used Latin script before English; the earliest examples of written English are in a runic script called Futhorc. Latin script was only later introduced by Irish missionaries.

Early Welsh orthography was not standardised, but was still notably distinct from English (eg. no æ, þ, or ð in Welsh, and no k in English, which was common in written Welsh at the time). 

The first serious step towards the standardisation of written Welsh was William Morgan's Bible in 1588. It's here that the influence of English starts to make itself felt. Famously, for example, the English printers introduced ""C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth"". [The use of digraphs was common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_(Bible_translator\)#/media/File:1588_First_Welsh_Bible_f.1.r_Genesis.jpg).

William Morgan's way of writing Welsh remained pretty much the standard up until the 19th century, when Dr Owen Pugh published a comprehensive dictionary with a radically different orthography. This sparked widespread disagreement among academic circles over how to write the language, which was only finally resolved in 1928 by the publication of *Orgraff yr Iaith Gymraeg* by the University of Wales Press, the publication which finally standardised the Welsh alphabet and orthography more generally.

The long and short of it is that yes, there is a standardised Welsh alphabet which treats eight digraphs as distinct letters. [Welsh is not the only language to do this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography\)#In_alphabetization).

hippopanotto,1378214178.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_czuag,False,"I hear your struggle friend. Feeling lost and worthless is all too common these days, even without the rejection and uncertainty you mention. 

This western culture teaches us what success is, tells us that anyone can get it if they work hard, and also whispers that mainstream success doesn’t actually lead to fulfillment. Naturally, you’re aware you shouldn’t compare yourself to others, or quantify your value by your GPA, but our culture doesn’t provide many alternatives to understanding value or meaning. Even though we are encouraged not to use the standard metrics, we can’t help but define our identities by the overt quantification of value and meaning that grades and job salary represent. 

There is a hollowness behind the story of our civilization. We think we can eternally grow as a society, as well as on the personal level. We tell ourselves that climate change and inequality are signaling the limits of growth, but we still don’t fully comprehend what it means to allow our society to diminish. Likewise, we deeply fear and abhor aging, wilting and dying. See this connection between the culture and the individual?

You are living in a time where we believe that everyone should go to college so they can get a good paying job, and to learn what they want to do, and to have a little more time in school before facing the “real world”. There is an unspoken belief that you’ll come out of college more mature than when you went in, practically an adult because of all your new knowledge. 

This story is a farce. College extends adolescence, and prevents young people from finding someone in the “real world” who can offer them their adulthood. Initiation cannot be undertaken alone, and it cannot occur within the safe confines of a campus or classroom. Becoming an adult requires that we learn something about this diminishment I mentioned earlier, what it is to age gracefully and face death as something meaningful. Countless older and old people walk around in our world thinking they’re adults because they have debt, own property, or even have kids, but they still live a selfish adolescent existence. This selfishness embodies our desire to grow and have success, and to forfeit half our lives to acquire it. Even when the so-called success is attained, that sense of worthlessness and lostness still constantly whispers “Is this it? What’s wrong with me? I need something more.”

In other cultures, older cultures and dead cultures, the adolescent is killed so that the mature adult can be born. Sometimes a new name is given (not chosen by the individual). We evolved as communal beings.  Adults who were given their role by their communities understood that limits must not only be respected, but that they will approach that limit in a personal way, and it’s up to them to relinquish their desire for more success and more value in a graceful way that shows the next generation why it’s important. 

Human Being is not found in growth and achieving success, it’s made in the simmering experience of frailty and dying. Initiations are supposed to take us to that precipice, where the challenge is not to overcome the obstacle of success, but to embrace endings and let them fill our lives with meaning and purpose in the context of our close relationships to people and the land we call home. 

I’m sorry if none of this seems to help. I don’t mean to just rant at you about problems with our culture. I’m trying to say that we live in troubled times, and that there is no clear answer for your suffering, that sense of being lost and worthless. I connect with what you describe, and I don’t want to waste your time with my own story, but suffice to say that I realized the worthlessness and lostness come from a failure in our modern worldview to acknowledge that a sense of meaningful purpose and home come from community, the likes of which this land has seen less and less of since Europeans arrived in the West with their own lostness and worthlessness. 

I don’t believe that committing yourself to improving, working harder, or being a better person are truly going to alleviate. Those commitments are what got us into this personal growth craze that is synonymous with our societal growth illusion. My advice for treating feelings of lostness and worthlessness is that you cannot do it by yourself because they come from the lack of close, reciprocal relationships to people and place. 

Seeking and making and inviting those kinds of relationships is more difficult than ever, precisely because of the perspective you were communicating- we keep comparing ourselves to some crazy idea of success, which no one in this world has actually achieved. 

Go easy on yourself. Go outside as much as possible. Spend time with your girlfriend, and other close friends. Trust that your life is unfolding properly, whether you get into grad school or not. Your feelings of lostness and worthlessness come from a deeper place than those schools’ rejections or your girlfriend’s success. 

My girlfriend is a nurse practitioner and incredibly hard worker. I took ten years to finish college, only to learn that I want to grow food and build community. Speaking from experience, be careful about putting her up on a pedestal, it creates distance that doesn’t actually exist. You love her, and she loves you, just enjoy the miraculous give and take, that reciprocity is the real jewel of life.

Quietly, United is changing its commercial approach, which could lead to fewer but bigger sponsorship deals. The group has around 100 people on its sponsorship team, far more than any other club. Many of them are analysts who gather industry data for salespeople to help clinch a deal. This dedication to research allowed United to seek marketing deals far and wide, gaining dozens of sponsors across the globe. These include Chi, its “official sports drink partner” in Nigeria, and Manda Fermentation, an “official nutritional supplements partner” in Japan. The model has been copied by rival clubs.

United has allowed some of these deals to lapse, focusing on a smaller group of “global” partners happy to pay bigger sums. They include US manufacturing group Kohler which has become United’s first shirtsleeve sponsor.

Other recent moves are designed to target millennials. Last August, the club launched an official app, a mobile service that provides live statistics during matches, interviews with players and other content. The plan is to build a direct relationship with supporters online, each a potential customer, gathering data on their preferences. The club claims it has become the most downloaded sports app in 70 countries.

“Teams who are now developing their fan base for the first time are doing it from scratch based on current performance,” says Phil Lynch, Manchester United’s head of media who leads its digital strategy. “They don’t have an emotional resonance the way you do if you already have an established fan base and your dad was a fan.”

The area of unpredictability in the club’s financial performance is the Champions League. Close to €1.95bn is shared among participating clubs of this season’s tournament, mainly from broadcasting contracts. Real Madrid overtook Manchester United as the world’s richest club last season, partly on the back of winning three consecutive Champions League titles.

The English club believes it is less reliant on continental success than rivals, with executives building financial projections on the more modest premise of regularly finishing at least third in the Premier League and reaching the Champions League quarter finals. 

Bigger problems emerge if poor performance becomes endemic, however. A poor start to this season means the club is battling to qualify for next term’s Champions League. United’s deal with Adidas contains a penalty clause which means failure to reach Europe’s top competition for two consecutive seasons will result it being paid £21m less for each year outside the tournament.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a recent paper that although United’s brand is durable it could be tarnished if the team is not regularly challenging for the biggest trophies. This could affect the club’s attractiveness to a new generation of supporters and decrease the value of future commercial deals. 

The club has thrown money at the problem. In the six seasons before Sir Alex retired, Manchester United had only the third highest wage bill in the Premier League, yet won the title three times and reached three Champions League finals, winning one. This was an impressive return, as research has shown the best predictor of a team’s league position is player salaries.

The club increased spending. But that has not worked. In the past five seasons, United had the Premier League’s highest wage bill, but did not come close to winning the title and reached the Champions League quarter-finals just once. 

“The damage was done [before Sir Alex’s exit] and we haven’t recovered,” says Duncan Drasdo, chief executive of the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which has argued that the more than £1bn the club has paid in loan interest charges, fees, dividends and other costs related to the Glazers’ £790m leveraged buyout of the club in 2005 would have been better spent on improving the playing squad. 

“If you’re serious about challenging the likes of PSG, you have to be investing in the same sort of level,” he says. “It isn’t clear that we will do that.”

What United needs is a capable heir to Sir Alex to make its financial power pay off. Mr Solskjaer has the task until the end of this season. A resurgence in form means he is being seriously considered as a permanent appointment, according to people close to the club’s leadership. Other targets are being assessed, including Tottenham Hotspur’s Mauricio Pochettino and former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane.

Perhaps a more important hire is that of a new “head of football”. Rivals like Liverpool, City and Spurs already have technical leaders tasked with building a playing squad over several years, identifying signings and training young players. The club put off making this appointment as Mr Mourinho fiercely resisted giving up any control of football affairs, according to people familiar with internal club matters.

However, Mr Woodward is still to define the precise nature of the head of football role, such as if they will take full control over transfers, according to a person close to the deliberations. Both internal and external candidates have had talks over the position. 

Making the correct calls over sporting operations may prove critical if the club is to turn a commercial juggernaut back into a dominant team.

We are lucky that the Knicks had a conflict with KP and we ended up getting value for DSJ but if KP hadn’t come I still think DSJ would have been traded anyway (either in this transfer window or in summer). Yes, you can actually hold on to a player and screw him all you want but it reflects bad on the organization and he will end up leaving anyways so you might as well trade him to get something in return.

Whether you like it or not the power is shifting towards players and we will probably see more shorter contracts being signed so that players can decide their futures (a la Durant in GSW or LeBron in his second stint in Cleveland). Yes, Doncic is happy now in Dallas and having an European legend in Dirk will probably mean a lot to him and it increases the chances that he stays for a long time but he is going to be one of the stars in the league and they all develop an ego at some point or another and that comes with some expectations and demands.

Still, I don’t think we will have any issue with Luka. He has already had some mentorship from veterans back in Real Madrid. Sergio Llull and Felipe Reyes are great figures to look up to and I’m sure they have already taught him valuable lessons.

Despite all this, I don’t think it would be such a bad move to bump up his minutes a bit now towards the end of the season. We are already locked into what’s going to be our position in the standings and I don’t see us moving up or down much.

It needs to be entertaining enough to keep you watching. Take Breaking Bad for instance.

You can have the most interesting characters, the best technical and creative aspects, but if it's not entertaining or interesting to keep you watching it's just bad. And a lot of European movies I've seen lack that. The storyline is either boring or tries too hard to be deep or inspiring.

I had a subject in highschool where I learnt the technical parts of a movie and learnt how to make it more artistically appealing. But honestly I never cared for it and still don't.

skratch_R,1516058890.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_v9ytdp,False,"The way i tend to do it uses bottlenecks. When you declare war on them (dont wait for them) it depends on where you are coming from. If you are in europe, rush constantinople, take the provinces on the straits and block them with your navy, or sit your armies in them to prevent crossings. Do the same with the gap between the carpathian wasteland and the black sea. Now siege down all the territory they have in europe, knowing that you can defeat each army only once, since they retreat to the other side of the bottlenecks. Use a 1k merc swarm to take all the provinces fast. If you are russia, do the same with the carpathian bottleneck, and the provinces at both sides of the caucasus. If you come from africa, block at suez and the strait at the bottom of arabia. If you come from persia, use the several bottlenecks in the persian mountains. 

The trick here is to be fast. Otto has a huge territory, and he only concentrates his armies when he is preparing for war or is currently at war. If you can split his territory in half before he can do this, you can deal with his armies, which very often have silly compositions like 20 inf, 14 cav and 2 art and no general, which you can destroy easily. 

You will probably need a general with high siege pips, and at least 3-4 stacks which can go to battle by themselves (something like 25-30k at least). For this i recommend offensive ideas, as they both improve your siege skills and your force limit. 

Your first war does not have to be an absolute victory. Take constantinople and the province next to it on the european side of the strait, or try to get more of greece if you can. This removes most of the ottoman power, and they will be weaker in the next war, and forced to either siege constantinople down next war, or try to walk around the whole black sea. Also this reduces their fleet force limit and will allow you to island trap them in places like naxos, corfu or venice, and mess them up in Crimea. 

Lastly, if this strategy fails and they get their deathstacks into your land, try to get their war exhaustion up with attrition.

Until recently, I have been represented by Patty Murray, who sits on the Finance Committee. Despite being part of the “pro worker” party, she has consistently voted against them. She helped Boeing move jobs to Europe and Microsoft open facilities in India. She encouraged legislation that limits overtime compensation for contractors, and to allow ordinary workers to be salaried - a designation which used to only be for managers. She’s pro NAFTA, pro WTO and pro TPP. To top that all off, she is aloof and thinks of herself as untouchable. She could not actually show more disdain for a constitutancy that keeps voting her in, for some reason.

Similar to Trump-Republicans who wish to unseat “RINOs” like Mitt Romney, these are the types of candidates the populist wing of the Democratic Party are trying to unseat. Who they replace them with is really the issue. That side of the party is angry, and the loudest are winning out.

I have seen essentially the same article again and again for years, every time China grows less than 7% in a year. But the actual downturn never happens. The trade deficit between the US and China is still growing year on year, even with the trade war - this represents the single largest fiscal transfer in the world; vast, vast amounts of capital flowing out of the US economy and into the Chinese economy. While I agree that China is more politically fragile than it seems from the outside, economically China is extremely robust and without a significant rival among developing nations. Predictions of Chinese economic implosion are overstated, imo - when the next crash hits, China won't simply be able to shrug it off like in 2008, but they'll almost certainly be far more insulated from it than the US and other western countries.

&gt; I can't believe people like you are making excuses for China. They are putting the Uighurs in concentration camps but you hate Trump so much you are on the side of the concentration camp people.

How on earth could you possibly come to the conclusion that I'm making excuses for China here? I *want* China to be effectively curtailed, and Trump (and you're right, the EU leadership too) is failing massively at this task.

I note that you haven't even at all responded to my points on the TPP - the TPP was supposed to be a precursor for the US launching a trade war on China, with the TPP free trade area in place to protect American markets from taking the blow, and shifting economic power away from China and towards other East Asian countries.

Without the TPP, or something similar, to underpin a trade war with the US, China isn't being hurt so badly that it will actually be forced to change its behaviour, as factories aren't shifting out of China and into Vietnam/Malaysia/wherever, and meanwhile America is harming its own economy significantly.",True,False,False,,0,1551627269,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehpb73m,False,t3_awsnjy,True,t1_ehp9tp3,/r/ukpolitics/comments/awsnjy/westminster_voting_intention_con_40_3_lab_34_3/ehpb73m/,False,,1555416490,0,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

1. NATO has effectively collapsed, and Europe is likely under the threat of Russia.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians went Holy Russian Empire and enacted their own population programs
2. Europe is likely unable or ineffective given its own birth rate issues.  They're internally under siege by their large religious fundamentalist migrant populations, who are also out-competing native born euros.  Eastern European nations like Poland/Hungary and the Baltics are holding out, but they're being pressured from the Russians on one side, and the failing Western European states on the other.
3. The UK is struggling hard, and is trying to rally its Commonwealth allies economically and militarily.  But since BREXIT happened, and the loss of the US as a major trading partner, things have not been effective thus far.
4. The UN has left NY in the USA, and relocated to Europe.  But it's ineffective and facing a choice it had early in its formation: who gets the US security council seat?  The government in exile?  Or the dominant one in Gilead?  This happened between the ROC and PRC Chinas early in the UN.
5. In the Middle East, things have gone more to shit.  The caliphate has been established and is gaining power.  Europe is under direct threat and dealing with state sponsored terror attacks.  Western China is also facing an insurgency.
6. China would be the worlds' logical superpower replacement for Gilead, but the loss of the US as a trading partner has seen its economy collapse and it will be stuck dealing with internal struggles in its West and a large aging population.
7. Japan is a nation reborn, with the US gone, its Constitutional restrictions on governance are lifted, and it is re-arming heavily.  A new alliance is forming around Japan as the center of gravity to counter China and includes South Korea and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
8. Canada is fucked.  They lack the military capabilities to take on Gilead, and need Gilead as a trading partner.  The Canadian economy is utterly tanking at this time.

The show so far is good, but the idea that Canada or an international coalition will be around without the USA is laughable.  If the US goes Gilead, no one will be riding in to liberate or save it.

**3) Becoming a force for the people, not just corporations:** What the EU is sorely missing and what is part of the reason why many people indeed have not gained a lot of prosperity as part of the EU is that it is missing a social pillar. So far, the EU has been a tremendous force at liberalisation and opening up of markets: markets for goods, services, but also labour. Without a social pillar that includes European solutions to problems of the distribution of welfare, Europeans can and do get caught in the cracks left open by neglecting the EU's social obligations towards its citizens. This includes, for example, the so-called posted workers; that is, workers working in another EU state for a company in based in their home state. The posted workers arrangement was often abused by companies with the goal of undercutting employees from wealthier states. For example, Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, and Croatian truck drivers would be paid way less than their counterparts from France, Germany, or Italy and thereby contributed to bad job perspectives for truckers from these wealthier states. 

But it also works the other way round. Thanks to the abolishment of internal borders within the Schengen area and freedom of movement for goods, services and labour, German companies have been able to outsource their parts manufacturing from Germany to poorer states, thus contributing to unemployment in Germany.

Yet another example is Ireland undercutting almost all of Europe in terms of taxation. Companies like to settle in Ireland when they come to Europe because in Ireland, tax authorities are especially lenient and allow, for example, Apple to pay miniscule tax. This behaviour by Ireland damages all of us but matters of taxation fall under the unanimity rule in the Council of Ministers, meaning that every state has to vote 'Yes' before a policy proposal becomes actual policy. Naturally, Ireland votes 'No' and blockades the EU from stepping in and stopping Ireland's damaging practice.

The social pillar is currently being conceived as a means to combat these undesirable developments. Conflict and debate can be had over how exactly to do this but the basic fact that something is done about this and could be done much more effectively is reason enough for me to be an advocate of federalism. **What citizens in the EU's fiscally conscious northern states and especially in Germany must understand is that redistribution in the EU's context does not mean 'Take from the Germans and give it to the irresponsible' but that an EU redistribution policy may benefit all of us. The talk in Germany of the country being 'paymaster of Europe' is false, not least because we Germans have greatly benefitted from the opportunity of German companies being able to export to European countries with very little barriers.**

**4) Foreign and security policy:** As the common saying goes, 'The EU is economically a giant but politically a dwarf'. Despite the heavy weight or our common market of 500 million comparatively wealthy people, the EU can make little use of its economic weight because our foreign and security policy are not unified at the EU level but remain with the states. These states have various interests that they are willing to push through, often at the expense of a larger European interest. 

One such great European interest is America and Russia being in something of a Cold War again. **Europe, and especially Germany, would be the main battleground if such a conflict were to heat up.** Western Europe's complacency and Eastern Europe's fear of Russia keep us basically married to the US who follow their own interest exclusively. America's meddling the Middle East is one of the causes of the refugee situation in Europe. **It is us who have since had to deal with refugee crisis and not the one who caused it in the first place. Not only that but many of those states that have positioned themselves especially staunchly against taking in any further refugees - such as Italy and Hungary - show little interest in common European measures against a further refugee influx. Instead of expanding the common border &amp; coast guard, they rather shift the blame where it is opportune at the moment** - be it on Germany, on George Soros, whoever.

Others have already pointed it out - as a federal sovereign union, the EU would have a seat in the UN Security Council, be a major force within the G-7 and G-20, have immense political power to shape the world in its interest, be an atomic superpower, and enough clout to fight off hostile takeovers by Washington, Moscow, and Beijing. 

In fact, I find it absolutely conceivable that the EU's states would have not less but *more* sovereignty under a federal EU than they have today, for the simple reason that the EU would provide a reliable, predictable rule of law internally, and a sizeable economic, diplomatic and military power on the outside - something the EU's smaller states do not have today. Small states especially are at the mercy of larger powers who may bend international law however it suits them. Today, as we speak, the Chinese are trying to [undermine sovereignty by granting generous loans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0gk_m0gZ0A) to less wealthy Eastern European states as part of China's national interest. Moscow is trying to divide Europe from within by equipping right-wing forces at the national level with funds in order for them to rallye against the EU, often with very dodgy reasoning. Russia's goal is [to re-establish its own dominance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z98moTOa7Y).

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"It’s true, there’s a high level of retirees and wealthy English (et al) that have bought whole villages in Wales. Funnily enough however, the one I’m thinking of is Abersoch, in North Wales (a remain area). It’s a literal ghost town in the winter months with house prices so high that locals (young families etc) can’t afford to buy in the area. 

Then come summer it turns into the north Walian Newquay. Awful. But the town survives (just) this way whilst generations of locals are forced to live elsewhere.

3. You may talk about Christian sites in Turkey, Turkey is actually Maqqa for Christians. There are many historical Christian sites in Turkey. -
4. You may talk about Millet system, Ottoman Empire Washington not a Sharia county. Each Millet had their own judiary. For example a Jew wouldn't be judged by other religion/nation judge. They will go to their own court. 
5. Ottoman Empire or as they call it Turkish Empire once the super power of the world. There were even cases some peoples would like to conjoin Ottoman Empire. Especially Orthodox nations because they wanted to live their religion. -
6. Turkish coffee invented during Ottoman Empire. It's true coffee beans are from Yemen and Africa. However they didn't have idea to brew it. Locals have consumed it as snack. So, coffee boomed through the empire. Many European travelers call it ""Muslim Drink"" . During Vien campaign Austrian captured bags of coffee. -
7. Some Jewish people saved by Turkish consulate in Germany during WW2. Turkish consulate created Turkish passports for them, and ask them to act as if they are Turkish. 
8. Einstein might have come to Turkey to continue his research, however since Turkey was in warzone he preferred USA. You can Google his letter to Atatürk( if I remember correctly Atatürk couldn't read the letter because he died ) -
9. Swedish king was hosted in Ottoman Empire. Sweden was invaded by Russia, so to able restore the country he fled to Turkey which Russia wouldn't dare to attack. Swedish king liked Turkey a lot, he didn't leave country even though his country was already safe. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden)
10. Turkey had Enderun which is a school for clever, talented students. I think it's the first in history. They selected kids throughout the empire. They must have to be smart and talented. They didn't care if his family is poor or peasant. You know in Europe education was for only rich and upper classes.

Execution is everything. 

Long Answer:  I started a business two years ago with a product idea that my partner and I had for a “reusable” filter for cannabis grows, and we brought two guys on board. We kicked them out two months in because they turned out to be terrible people with bad intentions. 

They’re now infringing on a patent we filed, and are going to market with the same “reusable” filter  idea we disclosed to them two years ago. 

That original idea is absolute garbage, and my partner and I pivoted over a year ago onto a much better filter product with lots of validation. 

Not only does the market not like the “reusable” filter they’re trying to go to market with, but because we filed our patent 3 months before they did, we have every right to take them to court for damages. 

But we’re not going to. Wanna know why? Because we’re going to succeed in the market place as we have a better product and better communication with our customers.

Brian Cheskey from air bnb does an excellent talk on this when a company in Europe tried to rip them off. Air bnb was missionaries, and the other company were mercenaries; not having the right vision, which allowed air bnb to provide the better product and have better communication with its users.

&gt;A meta-analysis of research published from 1965 to 1986 revealed the same sex difference (Feingold, 1992). Across studies, 3 out of 4 women rated socioeconomic status as more important in a prospective marriage partner than did the average man. Studies conducted prior to 1965 showed the same pattern (e.g., R. Hill, 1945) as did a more recent survey of a nationally representative sample of unmarried adults in the United States (Sprecher, Sullivan, &amp; Hatfield, 1994). Across age, ethnic status, and socioeconomic status, women preferred husbands who were better
educated than they were and who earned more money than they did. Buunk and colleagues found the same pattern for women ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s (Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, &amp; Kenrick, 2002). This preference is highlighted when women make cost-benefit trade-offs between a marriage partner's cultural success and other important traits, such as his physical attractiveness (Li, Bailey, Kenrick, &amp; Linsenmeier, 2002; Waynforth, 2001). When women are forced to make such trade-offs, a prospective marriage partner’s cultural success is rated as
a necessity and other characteristics as a luxury.

&gt;Economic resources. Women’s preference for men with economic resources has been abundantly supported by dozens of studies. The 37-culture study found that women valued long-term mates who had ‘good financial prospects’ more than did men (Buss, 1989a). The universality of this mate preference spans across cultures with different mating systems (presumptive monogamy versus polygyny), different levels of gender economic equality (e.g., Sweden versus Iran), and different religious orientations (e.g., Muslim, Jewish, Christian, atheist).
	

&gt;The findings have been replicated with multiple methods across dozens of cultures. In studies of the ‘minimum percentile’ people would accept in a long-term mate, women put earning capacity in the 70th percentile, whereas men put it in the 40th (Kenrick et al., 1990). Wang et al. (2018) asked men and women from China, the US, and Europe to rate the attractiveness of opposite sex individuals, experimentally manipulating the physical and economic (i.e., salary) information about the targets. Across all cultures, women were roughly one thousand times more sensitive to salary when rating men than men were when rating women. An in-depth study of the Hadza, a traditional hunter-gatherer group residing in Tanzania, found that women placed great importance on a man’s foraging abilities, centrally his ability to hunt and provide meat (Marlowe, 2004).
	

&gt;Ambition, industriousness, and social status. Sex differences in mate preferences for key predictors of economic resources are not quite as universal across cultures. The combined item ‘ambition and industriousness’ showed significant sex differences in 29 of the 37 cultures sampled (Buss, 1989a). Women in all cultures, however, placed a relatively high absolute value on this quality, typically giving it above a 2 on the 0–3 scale, where a 3 indicates ‘indispensable.’ For example, Nigerian women gave it 2.61, Chinese women 2.63, Iranian women 2.81, Estonian women 2.46, Italian women 2.07, and Swedish women 2.04.

It's about the most well understood and well replicated result of the field of human mate choice, with the possible exception of ""Men like youth/prettiness"".

&amp;#x200B;

Je suis une apprentie comédienne, cachée derrière le grand rideau je regarde la scène se jouer, les acteurs remuer, les décors bouger. Moi je suis là, une ombre qui se fond dans le silence et la pénombre. La scène est tumultueuse, on s’y agite, on pleure on rit on vit. Dieu qu’ils jouent bien, alors que moi je ne fais rien. J’analyse pleine d’empathie cette tragi-comédie qui se joue devant mes yeux ébahis. Je n’arrive pas à mettre le masque, je crois que j’aurais plutôt besoin d’un casque. Il paraît qu’on peut prendre des coups sur scène, c’est assez risqué de se lancer.

J’ai bien osé y faire un pas, la lumière m’a tendu les bras, les acteurs m’ont tendu la main mais je n’ai jamais eu assez d’entrain. Alors je continue à regarder le spectacle se jouer, je ne peux plus me retourner, je n’ai pas le droit de m’en aller. Au loin je vois des trains passer, mais dans aucun je n’ose monter, ni dans la vie m’aventurer. « La scène est un rêve, le rêve d’une vie, une vie de rêve », m’avait-on dit, dieu m’aurait-on menti ? Les coulisses sont gigantesques, les machines énormes, la scène est grotesque. Je reste là à observer ces géants qui construisent ce qui se joue là-devant. Je n’en crois pas mes yeux, et je reste à les fixer, comme aspirée par ce que mon esprit ne parvient pas à digérer.

Je n’ai pas peur de la scène, j’aurais simplement honte d’y être, je me sens comme un clown à un enterrement, comme une larme au milieu des sourires ou du sang. Alors j’ai aussi essayé de jouer, je n’ai pas osé mettre mon masque j’y suis allée comme ça, j’ai seulement mis un casque. Louée par toute une société m’y voilà entrée maintenant. Il s’agit de ne pas perdre de temps. Sans réfléchir je bouge frénétiquement dans tous les sens sans même savoir comment m’y prendre. « C’est de l’improvisation ici, il n’est pas question de passion », me glissera-t-on alors que je tentais de m’intégrer. Je n’ai pas peur, jamais je ne pleure. Je n’ai pas de masque, mon visage doit rester de marbre. Je ne dis rien je dois rire et sourire chanter et danser, chanter et hurler, danser et pleurer, vivre et mourir. Ca y est tu es sur scène, tu n’es pas fière ? Tout le monde rêverait de faire partie de ce monde de pierre, alors il n’y a qu’une seule chose à faire : montre nous que tu es fière, vante toi et montre toi. Je suis sur scène, joue dans le spectacle ! Amuse toi ! Montre nous comme tu joues bien ! Mais comment peux-tu ne pas aimer y être ? Ici tout n’est que paraître. Alors joue le spectacle n’aies pas peur, fais comme tout le monde, tu verras, on te jettera des fleurs.

Au milieu de ce cirque je ne sais qui je suis, je me demande si mon rôle est bien là et mon identité masquée. Tout tourne et tourne, joue et joue, chante et danse, remue et bouge, parle et chuchote, palabre et pleure, invective et insulte, crie et hurle. Je me bouche les oreilles mais c’est désespéré, je n’arrive plus à bouger, le public applaudit, le rideau est trop loin. J’ose un regard vers l’arrière, les derniers trains vont quitter le quai, je ne sais quoi faire, je me mets à crier, mais personne ne m’entends, je ne suis pas là depuis assez longtemps, des larmes recouvrent mon visage, je vais bientôt prendre de l’âge, le temps est venu de faire un choix.

In Korea in high leagues (M or GM) there are 433 zergs, 488 protosses and 480 terrans. In total there are 8514 zergs, 9007 protosses and 11060 terrans, which means that in korean ladder terrans have 4.3% conversion rate, protosses 5.4% and zergs 5,1%.

In Eu, high leagues contain 1363z, 1210p, 1204t with total population 22431z, 23555p and 24312t so conversion rates are 6.1% for z, 5.1% for p and 5.0% for t.

In NA high leagues contain 1365z, 1179p, 1263t with total population 25147z, 26385p, 27961t so rates are 5.4% for z, 4.5% for p, 4.5% for t.

In CN, high leagues contain 909z, 976p, 1089t with total population 19748z, 22578p, 25171t so conversion rates are 4.6%z, 4.3%p, 4.3%t.

Across the world there are 75840 zergs, 81525 protosses, 88504 terrans of which 4070z, 3853p and 4030t are M or GM. This gives conversion rates of 5.3% for zerg, 4.8% for protoss and 4.5% for terran. Note that this data is the least useful because of ""apples and oranges"" effect.

So across all leagues zergs and protosses have higher conversion rate but the difference isn't large unless you are in Korea where Korean terrans have absolutely abyssmal conversion rate (somehow 38% of all bronze players and 37% of all silver players in KR are terran).

The second important point is that the Battle for the Atlanic and the Royal Navy blockade of Germany was an extremely important part of the war where the UK dominated. If there was no Royal Navy blockade, the German army would not be deprived of oil (Germany imported 60% of its oil and lost all of that due to the UK) and would have been *much* more effective against the Soviets, not even considering the British pulling a lot of German forces away from the Eastern front throughout the war. Or the British role against Japan in Burma. The entire reason that Stalingrad was a turning point in the war was that that was the moment the Wehrmacht started getting low on oil and Russia succesfully defended their oil fields. At that point the Wehrmacht was crippled. Without a naval blockade, they never would be crippled in the first place and Stalingrad wouldn't have been enough to stop them.  


If the US wasn't there, everyone would be deprived of supplies and seriously weakened, probably leading to defeat. And the Japanese Navy would have to be beat by the Royal Navy (which possibly could have won this anyway, but perhaps it wouldn't have).   


If the Soviets wouldn't be there, the full force of Germany could have protected the European coasts, leading to an automatic Allied loss because Europe would be an impenetrable fortress. German supremacy in Europe would be a fact and disputing it not even an option. Maybe Britain would have been invaded, maybe not. We also have to question how the Atlantic theatre would have gone if Germany produced a significantly larger naval/submarine force.  


The only possible way for the allies to win without one of them participating would be if America kept supplying the allies but didn't actually join the fight themselves. The Royal Navy could in theory have won against the Japanese Navy and the British Empire could in theory have introduced conscription in their colonies to compensate for the absence of American forces (they always insisted on having Britain itself carry most of the burden and leaving it up to their colonies/dependencies how many troops they sent to help.

Skylon is a series of designs for a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system.  The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach 5.4 at 26 kilometres (16 mi; 85,000 ft) altitude (compared to typical airliners' 9–13 kilometres (6–8 mi; 30,000–40,000 ft)) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry 17 tonnes (17,000 kg; 37,000 lb) of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to 11 tonnes (11,000 kg; 24,000 lb) to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or 7.3 tonnes; 7,300 kilograms (16,000 lb) to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 24% more than SpaceX F9 RTLS (As of  2018.) The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin.  When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle.

I didn't realize it was the 20th anniversary of *Office Space*,  and for such a cult favorite it's surprisingly conventional and  mild-mannered. It just happened to perfectly capture white collar life  at the time, and is still a great example of how *not* to run a business.

**Dr. T and the Women** (2000) \*\*\*\*

Richard  Gere's a gynecologist stuck in a women's world as his upper class life  slowly crumbles around him. I found this surprisingly enjoyable and  easy-going - my kind of rom com. The ending is kind of left field but  somehow works, perhaps because there's no real story pushing the film  along. Altman also loves corny humor like zooming in on signs that  comment on the  action - which he does frequently in this film, *Thieves Like Us*, and  *The Player*.

**Marriage, Italian Style** (1964) \*\*\*\*

It took a while for me to get into the mood of the film, but once Sophia Loren's character comes alive and takes charge of the movie,  it's very entertaining and easy to see why it was enormously popular.  Loren and Mastroianni are the perfect sophisticated 60s Italian couple.

**The Freshman** (1925) \*\*\*\*

It's  not the best silent comedy ever made, or even the best Harold Lloyd  comedy, but it was one of the most popular movies of the silent era.  This spoof on college life (which seems to only consist of sports and parties)  remains charming and funny from start to finish, and  Lloyd's film is better than Buster Keaton's take on the same idea in 1927's *College*.

&amp;#x200B;

**HAROLD LLOYD SHORTS**

**Take a Chance** (1918) \*\*

A  clever enough slapstick comedy that ends in a literal butt-kicking  police chase. Forget bulletproof vests. These cops need bulletproof  underwear. Buster Keaton would ""steal"" a lot of ideas from this for *Convict 13* in 1920.

**Just Neighbors** (1919) \*

A chaotic short film about suburban life that is more about pratfalls than story.

**Ask Father** (1919) \*\*

A  simple premise - Lloyd has to get to the girl's busy father to ask her  hand in marriage - provides lots of hectic gag opportunities including  wearing a suit of armor.

**Young Mr. Jazz** (1919) \*\*\*

Another  one where Lloyd has to win over the father that takes place mostly in a  brawling nightclub full of vice and sin (a year before prohibition).

**Captain Kidd's Kids** (1919) \*\*\*

Half the movie is drunken hangover slapstick, the other half is on a pirate ship manned by lovely women. Fun.

**His Royal Slyness** (1919) \*\*\*\*

Ambitious  25 minute short featuring ornate European court settings, lots of  extras, and a very convincing double for Lloyd enabling the old  switcharoo.

**An Eastern Westerner** (1920) \*\*\*

East  coast rich playboy gets sent out west to poke fun at a bunch of western  cliches and eventually get run out of town by the Klan. Less of a fish  out of water story than I expected, it's mostly just gags hanging off classic melodrama. During a card game you get a good look  at the glove he wears to hide the fingers he lost in a publicity stunt  only a year before.

There haven't been any big changes noticed by the public, yet. Specifically, ISP's have not been obviously charging for fast lanes in any glaring and broadly-recognized way. This is a fair, if premature headline-level take.

&amp;#x200B;

Carriers are prioritizing and de-prioritizing traffic. They already had been, and, with more freedom to do so, will be. It has its reasons, good and bad. It doesn't yet measure up to the doom scenarios. Either way, tighter insulation of the internet is needed, protecting it from throttling, prioritization, and other things that serve businesses at the great expense of the overall good. The self-interest of those companies is not enlightened and will not guide itself. It hasn't and it won't. 

&amp;#x200B;

They aren't the only examples and concerns. Ignorant, crazy, and veiled legislation like SOPA keeps coming back, and back, and back, and back. Using ""security from attacks"" and ""ability to deal with child porn"" as tools, organizations like the RIAA and MPAA are relentlessly and recklessly using what power they have to get their way, which is not compatible with a healthy internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps easiest to see, prove, and recognize with consensus is this: the companies, legislators, and regulators to no not know how the internet works.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, ""nothing happened"" is true, with a giant asterisk. The business element of the internet did show itself to be like cable TV, in harmful ways. It showed corporate lobbying of many kinds can corrupt the laws and governing of the land. The examples of that are replete, including the corruption of the FCC's collection of comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Saying nothing bad happened and it turns out we don't need net neutrality protections is like someone saying they don't need motorcycle helmets or data backups because they haven't had a problem. Yet. In a limited amount of time.

Parece uma sequência de BlacKkKlansman, o novo filme de Spike Lee que no domingo passado ganhou o Oscar de melhor roteiro adaptado.

Mas a realidade supera mais uma vez a ficção.

James Hart Stern, um ativista negro de 54 anos, é o novo presidente do Movimento Nacional Socialista (NSM, da sigla em Inglês), um dos maiores grupos anti-semitas e racistas dos Estados Unidos.

E, aparentemente, ele já tem um objetivo claro: destruir esse grupo.

O Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), ONG que monitora os movimentos supremacistas, confirmou à BBC News Mundo, o serviço em espanhol da BBC, que em janeiro Stern substituiu o neo-nazista Jeff Schoep - que defende um país ""apenas brancos"" - como presidente da NSM.

Não se sabe ao certo como o ativista chegou à liderança da organização, apontada pelo SPLC como um dos maiores ""grupos abertamente hitleristas"" no país.

Documentos a que a BBC News Mundo teve acesso, entretanto, indicam que Stern já deu os primeiros passos para ""reformar"" o grupo.

   Direito de imagem AFP   Image caption  O Movimento Nacional Socialista realiza manifestações frequentes em que presta homenagem à ideologia nazista   Um ofício datado de janeiro indica que Stern, já como presidente, pediu a mudança de endereço e de representantes legais do grupo, que aparecia em nome de Schoep e do advogado Elmer Woodard, a cara legal do supremacismo branco nos Estados unidos.

Outro documento judicial nomeia Stern como representante em uma ação civil que alega que o NSM estava entre as organizações que causaram ""danos emocionais e econômicos"" a dezenas de pessoas na manifestação neo-nazista "" Unite the Right"" (Unir a direita, em tradução literal), realizada em 2017 em Charlottesville, Virgínia.

Seu primeiro passo enquanto presidente foi pedir ao juiz que declare o grupo culpado de conspirar para cometer atos de violência durante a manifestação, que deixou uma pessoa morta.

     Image caption  Documentos judiciais atestam as primeiras mudanças promovidas por Stern   Até este fim de semana, nem Stern nem Schoep haviam falado publicamente sobre o assunto.

A BBC News Mundo tentou contatá-los, mas não obteve resposta.

No entanto, em uma página de Facebook que parece pertencer ao ativista, ele compartilhou sexta-feira - com um comentário enigmático - uma notícia sobre o vazamento de sua nomeação.

""Eu vou fazer a declaração mais assustadora sobre a raça desde o Caso Mississippi em Chamas, de 1964"", disse ele, se referindo aos assassinatos de ativistas pró-direitos civis dos negros naquele ano.

Mas quem é esse ativista e o que se sabe sobre como ele se tornou líder de um dos maiores grupos neonazistas dos Estados Unidos?

Quem é James H Stern?
---------------------

Stern, nascido em 1965 em Moreno Valley, Califórnia, é um reverendo protestante e defensor dos direitos civis dos negros que também lidera o Ministério de Alcance para a Reconciliação Racial, uma ""organização progressista e internacional que luta pela mudança social"", de acordo com a sua página na internet.

De acordo com o SPLC, ele ficou conhecido há alguns anos por dissolver um ""capítulo notório"" do grupo racista Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

O agora líder do grupo neonazista, aliás, publicou em outubro passado um livro intitulado ""O Mississippi ainda está em chamas"", em que conta como foi o processo pelo qual acabou com a célula da organização supremacista.

Segundo o livro, em 2010, Stern, que cumpriu cinco anos de prisão, dividiu cela com um ""grande guru"" do Ku Klux Klan, Edgar Ray Killen, apontado anos antes como responsável pelas mortes, em 1964, de três ativistas negros que pediam direito a voto para pessoas afrodescendentes.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Os membros do NSM usam abertamente os símbolos nazistas   Após sua libertação, Killen assinou uma procuração e deu a ele direitos sobre algumas terras.

Stern posteriormente o usou para acabar com o núcleo do KKK do qual o supremacista fazia parte.

Não foi a primeira vez que um homem negro se inseriu em organizações de extrema direita.

Na verdade, BlacKkKlansman, o filme de Spike Lee, conta a história real de Ron Stallworth, um policial que conseguiu se infiltrar no KKK e ascender dentro dele.

Mas pouco antes de acabar com uma célula do Klan, outro acontecimento casual levou Stern a um dos maiores movimentos neonazistas dos Estados Unidos.

O que é o NSM?

O NSM foi criado na década de 1970 com o nome de Movimento Nacional Socialista dos Trabalhadores Americanos pela Liberdade. É um dos que celebram as doutrinas de Hitler.

De acordo com o SPLC, foi durante anos um grupo periférico, até que no início dos anos 2000 se tornou uma das estruturas neo-nazistas mais notáveis do país.

O grupo é conhecido por participar de manifestações com uniformes que lembram os dos soldados da Alemanha nazista e organiza várias reuniões e eventos em rede, assim como marchas em várias épocas do ano.

Schoep, que foi seu líder a partir de 1994, o registrou 10 anos depois como organização sem fins lucrativos.

E, segundo Stern, sua proximidade com Killen despertou a curiosidade dele. 

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Membros do grupo também usam uniformes semelhantes aos de soldados da Alemanha nazista   Em fevereiro de 2017, Stern anunciou publicamente em seu blog que se encontraria com o ""Comandante do maior grupo supremacista branco do mundo"" para discutir algumas mudanças.

""O reverendo Stern assume esse grupo que despejou tanto veneno no mundo com sua propaganda racista para mudar suas maneiras"", escreveu ele na época.

Ele explicou ainda que não era a primeira vez que eles se reuniam e atribuiu a seus esforços o fato de o grupo ter trocado a suástica de sua bandeira pela runa Odal - outro símbolo comum da supremacia branca.

Mas nada mais se soube a respeito desde então.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Stern diz que influenciou para que o grupo trocasse a suástica de sua bandeira pela runa Odal   Em uma entrevista ao *The Washington Post *na sexta-feira, o reverendo contou que Schoep entrou em contato com ele em janeiro passado para lhe pedir aconselhamento sobre a ação judicial envolvendo Charlottesville e suas possíveis implicações financeiras.

De acordo com declarações do reverendo, Schoep também teria dito que se sentia menosprezado por seus seguidores e excluído do movimento nacionalista branco que, segundo ele, havia varrido o país depois das eleições presidenciais de 2016.

Em páginas de redes sociais usadas por membros de partidos neo-nazistas e consultadas pela BBC News Mundo, há diversos comentários negativos dos participantes sobre Schoep e o curso que ele estava dando à organização.

Alguns mencionavam, inclusive, que o NSM vivia uma ""guerra interna"" entre seus dirigentes.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Os supremacistas do grupo diziam que não estar satisfeitos com a direção de Schoep   E aí, Stern afirma que viu o filão: ele propôs que Schoep lhe passasse o controle da organização e de seu site.

De acordo com o *Washington Post, *entretanto, Schoep escreveu uma declaração aos seguidores ""afirmando que havia sido enganado por Stern"". 

Segundo o texto, o reverendo o teria convencido de que, ""para proteger nossos membros (da organização) do processo em andamento, eu deveria passar a presidência do NSM para ele"".

Stern diz que se limita a buscar conselhos entre líderes judeus para determinar o que fazer com o grupo, embora tenha descartado a possibilidade de dissolvê-lo imediatamente.

Um de seus objetivo, disse ele, é transformar o site em um espaço para ""educar"" os seguidores da NSM sobre a história do Holocausto.

Resta saber o que os membros do movimento neonazista pensam sobre o seu novo líder.

Tu parles à une personne qui adorerait que les candidats aux législatives doivent justifier qu'ils vivent bien depuis au moins deux ans dans la circonscription qu'ils sont censés diriger (en plus d'autres choses mais ce n'est pas le sujet).

Le gros problème des proportionnelles à l'une des élections les plus importantes de la vie politique française c'est que tous les gros bonnets des différents partis politiques seront en tête de liste, les représentants ""mineurs"" de ces mêmes partis étant relégués tout au fond de la liste, en gros ""l'appareil parisien"" sera surreprésenté au détriment des représentants de la province et des DOM-TOM (qui dans leurs cas seront fort probablement condamnés à se retrouver au fin-fond des listes électorales si par miracle ils ont la chance de s'y trouver).

Donc oui je persiste, une représentation politique est contraire à une représentation géographique et est selon moi non-souhaitable afin d'éviter de centraliser la vie politique française.

&gt;Pour ma part, le fait que le parti gagnant les présidentielles remporte  aussi les législatives est par contre contraire à la séparation des  pouvoirs (puisque le parti gagnant dispose non seulement du pouvoir  exécutif, mais aussi du législatif avec l'assemblée, chose qui serait  difficile à produire avec une assemblée élue à la proportionnelle au vu  du nombre de parti et de la quasi-impossibilité d'obtenir plus de 50%  des députés au parlement pour un seul parti)

Attention à ne pas tout confondre ! Si depuis la mise en place du quinquennat les résultats des élections présidentielles et législatives donnent la victoire au même parti politique c'est uniquement dû à leur rapprochement dans le calendrier électoral ! On pourrait d'ailleurs régler ce problème en faisant de nouveau en sorte qu'un mandat de député aie une durée différente qu'un mandat présidentiel (dans l'idéal 3 ans). Une autre solution serait une solution à l'américaine: deux élections partielles à l'Assemblée élisant la moitié des députés: l'une en début de mandat présidentiel et l'autre à mi-mandat.

&gt;la date de l'élection  législative importe peu, puisque tout président ou gouvernement d'une  majorité autre que celle celle élue au parlement peut le dissoudre (dans  la limite d'une fois par an), et aura tout intérêt à le faire.

Ah, tu parles probablement [du truc qui n'a eu lieu que 5 fois depuis l'instauration de la Vème République](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_parlementaire_(France)#Les_pratiques_de_la_dissolution_sous_la_Cinqui%C3%A8me_R%C3%A9publique) et qui dans le cas de Mitterrand a eu lieu au début de ses mandats. Je suis d'accord sur le fait que cette possibilité devrait être au mieux fortement limitée (par exemple pour incompétence si jamais l'Assemblée s'amuse à faire passer en boucle des lois retoquées par le Conseil Constitutionnel), mais on ne peut clairement pas dire qu'elle a été un instrument d'instabilité politique. Il est d'ailleurs amusant de noter que la dernière dissolution s'est soldée par une belle défaite électorale pour Chirac, ce qui a donné la dernière cohabitation de la Vème République.

Au passage: [le gouvernement est défini en fonction de la représentation de l'Assemblée Nationale](http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/decouvrir-l-assemblee/role-et-pouvoirs-de-l-assemblee-nationale/les-institutions-francaises-generalites/le-gouvernement).

&gt; Le scrutin uni-nominal à deux tours pose le défaut que peu de partis  peuvent se permettre d'avoir un candidat pour chaque canton (pas assez  d'argent, donc pas de propagande électorale), et que la représentation  s'en retrouve donc faussée. 

Alors oui c'est un défaut, mais son effet est en réalité négligeable.

With tennis there is one World tour with multiple levels of tournaments, you pretty much start the ladder at the bottom and you work your way up it qualifying for new levels as you go. With Tennis you pretty much at some point have to travel the world in order to get enough points to break into top 100. Additionally, there are no ""declaring yourself pro"".   


In golf there two top tier tours right now, the euro tour and the PGA tour. They have also comined to make WGC tournaments and additionally majors. The majors in golf are relatively equal to Grand Slams in tennis. Majors give you points on both the PGA tour and the European tour depending on where you play or if you play both. Same for WGC. In addition to getting points on both tours you get points on the OWGR (world ranking). This system is sort of the same as in tennis where you have one ""season"" ranking that starts at the beginning for each year and one continuous  world ranking, i believe the OWGR lasts for longer than in tennis where you have to defend your points every year, whereas in golf you keep them for 2.5 years(?).   


Additionally there are some continent specific tours, such as australasia (i think) and PGA South America. These tours are lower tiers than Euro and PGA, but you can qualify for both through these tours. I do believe you eventually have to go through [web.com](https://web.com) for PGA though.   


I live in Norway, and for someone wanting to play on the european tour here the pathway is something like Norwegian Cup -&gt; Nordic League -&gt; Challenge Tour -&gt; European Tour.   


For the PGA the traditional pathway is [Web.com](https://Web.com) and then PGA, most players seem to go through college system before [web.com](https://web.com) tour as well. Im sure someone else from the US can shed some more light on this.   


For me the biggest difference is that you have two top tier tours that are continent specific instead of one propper world tour. European tour is expanding though and covers more continents than just Europe. I think the biggest reason for this is that the PGA is such a strong brandname and is definitelly the most competitive tour with the most money so there are no incentives for this tour to expand outside of US.

I'm guessing you mean just the monolid eye, right? It is apparently established within Asian populations before the introduction of rice agriculture. It is more common, today, in China and nearby areas than in, say the Philippines. 

You'd have to go trait by trait. Asian people include some of the world's darkest and lightest skin colors. Not everyone has straight hair (although, it's mostly black - which is true for Africa and Native America as well).

Certainly, we all notice people who are different than our local norms (if that's what you're meaning by ""ethnicity."")  I teach in a place that's about half Hispanic students, but even they cannot accurately ""pick out"" all the other Hispanics - they just think they can. Imagine the consternation of one of my colleagues (born in Reynosa, MX, raised in McAllen, TX; first language - Spanish, still has slight Spanish accent, descended genetically from (mostly) Spaniards - and he has student after student tell him he's ""not Hispanic"" because he has blue eyes).

If what you're really interested in is whether people know the variation within their own local breeding populations, then yes, of course, in a place like Sweden, someone who is from Colombia or Sierra Leone will stand out. But if you take an ""Hispanic"" from San Bernardino, CA and drop them in Manila, they will not be classed as ""HIspanic"" (or even different from the local population). Same thing if you drop them in Honolulu. However, if you drop them in Spain, they will be quickly recognized as an American, but not as an Hispanic.

You're conflating many different things (people in less diverse areas noticing strangers; ethnic classification as a local rubric; genetically determined traits with known regional patterns, etc).",True,False,False,,0,1551642699,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehpv3ap,False,t3_awrk8h,False,t1_ehptpbe,/r/AskAnthropology/comments/awrk8h/how_ethnically_diverse_were_cavemen/ehpv3ap/,False,,1555425925,4,True,False,AskAnthropology,t5_2wl4u,r/AskAnthropology,public,

That's a bit ridiculous. Specific expressions of ethical rules are subjective, but the basic principles behind them cross all cultural and language boundaries and basically all cultures agree on what is acceptable and what isn't.

This ethical principle boils down to the non-aggression principle, and the rest of ethics is specific implementation of that principle.

&gt;&gt;Homesteading isn't a use of force on anyone.

&gt;The acquisition and defense in absentia of private property is viewed as aggressive force by left-libertarians because they hold different property ownership standards.

That's fine, they can view it that way, but it's clearly not a use of force against them. And they don't have any right to force their ethical view or norms on me either, do they. Their attempts to force their norms of me would also be viewed as a breach of my norms, as a use of force against me. 

Difference is, my norms don't require me to interfere with them, but they constantly talk about invading others to take their claimed property away. They are clearly the aggressors in that scenario.

Where you have two groups who fundamentally disagree on property norms, the solution is simply to let them live separately. One to the left, one to the right.

In contrast, the left communist solution appears to be ""invade then and take their stuff.""

If the left-libertarians will not similarly resort to war and attacking those with different norms, then we're back to peaceful coexistence.

&gt;If others hold different private property standards, then there's no reason for them to not, say, wage war against Ancapistan and call it justified. 

There is a reason. The purpose of norms is to help avoid conflict by making clear where your stuff and my stuff ends. Historically many norms have been used for this and norms have developed as a matter of tradition.

Private property norms are in wide use today because they've generally proven to be the best norms of all so far.

But where someone has a property norm that creates conflict rather than avoids it, they have a barbarous norm, not a civilized one. 

Cultures with barbarous, warlike norms have tended to disappear over time, because they continually conflict with the peaceful societies around them which tend to have far more economic power.

The Steppes Tribes, aka the Mongols and their people generally, held some barbarian norms; anyone not a member of their tribe had no rights and could be raped and murdered at will, even children and babies. And they did so, and it worked for thousands of years until the modern era put a stop to it and you don't even hear a peep out of those tribes today, they're an afterthought on the world stage, despite being the most powerful military in pre-modern history, and despite very nearly invading Europe, which they surely would've conquered completely. Only historical accident prevented it.

Similarly we can cite the Apache Indians whose culture of manhood required them to raid enemy camps and kill outsiders, and as a result they were very resistant to the idea of peace. They played Mexico and America against each other so they could keep raiding one side or the other until both cooperated to destroy them. But for a time the whole region feared them incredibly, into utter panic.

The only answer to a community that employs barbarous norms and will not agree to leave you in peace is physical confrontation. This is obvious.

In the same way that a bank robber or a murderer forces you to hunt them down and subdue them, there is no words that help at that point. They have ceased operating in civilized, peaceful fashion and force is the last resort.

But don't pretend that this places is on equal footing. Libertarian are willing to live in peace with anyone. Anyone who cannot do that, for whatever reason, is--I would say a barbarian, but because these people have been raised in this society and know better, it is perhaps best to call them *evil*. Barbarians at least have the excuse of having been born into that situation and this brainwashed so children into that culture.

What is the excuse of the murderous left who were raised in a society of peace and yet still choose war? Nothing can excuse that.

&gt;The defense of Ancapistan against anarcho-communist takeover might be viewed as aggressive from the anarcho-communist point of view.

And again, when differences are irreconcilable, what matters is will you leave the other alone.

The ethical decision is to leave them alone.

To the extent anyone chooses to create conflict in that situation, they are in the wrong.

They are wrong for the same reason that breaking into a BDSM club and stopping someone from whipping another person there would be wrong.

It helps counter this for its members, not for outsiders obviously.

&gt; I'm then asking for proof [..] that countries in the EU actually can decide more for themselves than countries outside of it can. 

If you're asking for proof that countries within a union can act completely independently of others in the union, then obviously the statement is false: there would be no point to the union if that were the case.

If you adjust the statement to: within a union the members can decide on a common position that they can then project that position much more effectively than if each country tried individually.

For example, the EU has done dozens of FTAs for all it's 28 members. Could each of those members have done the same number of FTAs. Absolutely not. Would Japan ever sign an FTA with Estonia? Unlikely. Good for small countries.

The EU means the rules of origin are expanded to cover the whole EU, so (for example) the German/Italian/French car industry doesn't have to source all of their components from their own country from wherever is best. A large single market allows countries to specialise which increases wealth.

Obviously, such a union works best if the countries are closely related and have similar goals, which is true for Europe. The vast majority of votes in the European Council are unanimous, which shows it works. Turkey is an edge-case, and countries in Northern Africa are too different to make this work.

&gt; That you presumable think it is irrelevant whether nations can decide their fate or not is an different debate altogether. 

I'm not sure it is a different debate. Can countries in the modern world actually ever act totally independently? Also ""decide their fate"" sounds incredibly fatalistic. I'd ask ""can nations work to become more prosperous"" then the answer is yes, and that IMHO they do so better as a group than alone.

what the fuck do ukraine and poland's long histories of anti-semitism have to do with capitalism.   socialism being nominally anti-anti-semitic does not make capitalism inherently anti-semitic.  again, youre treating this like fucking sports.   ""your team has an anti-semite on it, nyahhh""

i wouldnt say ""forcefully dismantled by the us"", id just say a socialist state gradually dismantled by capitalism using the imfs standard predatory procedure.   but yeah that is broadly true.  see?   reality suffices!   relevance is good!

although making a direct connection from the imf to the ethnic warfare is dumb.   yugoslavia could easily have split into independent states or been further federalized (as was proposed in 1990 by bosnia, vojvodina and croatia) entirely peacefully (slovenia and macedonia pretty much did become independent peacefully) if the initiative hadnt been seized by fervent ethnonationalists in (not so much) croatia and (whoa) serbia.     the chaos was caused by the serbs having sizeable populations within the constituent yugoslav republics of bosnia and croatia who were stirred up into ethnic frenzies by the idea of being ruled over by muslims or croats and/or their natural-born right to the land (i should point out that #notallserbs; through all the call ups to the jna, over 300000 military age male serbs left the country or deserted in response).  so, they set about a land grab in southern croatia (so-called sao krajina) and various parts of bosnia in a rush to incorporate them into forthcoming serbia (or ""yugoslavia"").   they also wanted a route to the sea at dubrovnik.

when i said eastern bloc i should have clarified i didnt mean the ussr itself, just the eastern european dependents (and non-dependents).   yes this is true and it is very bad.   again, why make shit up when reality provides all you need

socialism and capitalism are ideologies.   they are not people or organizations.   or more pointedly, they do not require religious devotion, which is what defending absolutely anything any socialist or anti-western power has ever done essentially amounts to

&gt; The Get Up Kids are a Kansas City-based American emo band. Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-90's emo scene, otherwise known as the ""second wave"" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes &amp; Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. While the imprint was started to release albums by The Get Up Kids, it served as a launching pad for several side-projects such as The New Amsterdams and Reggie and the Full Effect.
The Get Up Kids were viewed throughout their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been major players in the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s.[4] However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an ""emo band.""Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that ""the punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It’s like glam rock now . . . If this is the world we helped create, then I apologize.” 

&gt; Influential Kansas City five piece, The Get Up Kids, return in January 2011 with a new studio album,There Are Rules – the band’s fifth full-length collection, and the first on their own Quality Hill Records imprint.  

&gt; Seven years after what looked to be their final album Guilt Show, with the group disbanding a year later in 2005 after 10 years of constant touring, The Get Up Kids returned to the studio in 2009, sparked by a spur-of-the-moment decision to start writing songs together again, made while they were rehearsing to promote the tenth anniversary edition of their breakout album ‘Something to Write Home About’. 

&gt; The first fruits of these new recordings was ‘Simple Science’, released in April 2010 - an EP that burst, unannounced, into the Billboard Top 200.  But that was just a taste – a precursor to the full-length album, which Alternative Press magazine, upon hearing a whisper of its existence, placed on their “most anticipated…” list.  

&gt; The band re-convened at their Black Lodge studio in Eudora, KS at various times in 2010 to complete the recordings, and so ‘There Are Rules’ came to be - twelve new songs that will prove to be both surprising, and familiar. The result is a collection of songs that are fresh and inspired, created by a band that has been given new life and isn’t looking back.  In some fashion, the new tracks mark a return to the early days of The Get Up Kids, when they formed fifteen years ago above a drum store in downtown Kansas City.  The recording involved lots of analog 2” tape – live takes and a feel for the unexpected.  Long time producer Ed Rose was once again seated behind the mixing desk, and the band even turned to Chicago luminary Bob Weston, who recorded their debut, Four Minute Mile, to master the album. “This record came together really organically.  We'd throw out an idea and if it didn't work after 30 minutes we'd scrap it and move on to another one.  We all wrote together really spontaneously and then fleshed it out with Ed in the studio,"" says Matt Pryor. 

&gt; At the same time, ‘There Are Rules’ marks a new chapter for The Get Up Kids, as they return to their independent roots, forming their own label – Quality Hill Records – and reigniting the DIY spirit that originally launched the band onto the worldwide stage.  Says Pryor, “""We had a really great relationship with Vagrant but we felt that with the proverbial rebirth of the band we wanted to start our own label.  Do everything ourselves like we did in the beginning.""  And as to naming the imprint? ""Quality Hill is a historic neighborhood in Kansas City.  It's not far from where we first formed the band.  It seems like an appropriate name for the label."" And of course, echoing their formative years, there is a 7” single involved.  That 45 would be ‘Automatic’ – a limited edition release due in January 2011. 

&gt; And so, after touring across four continents to sold out crowds too many times to count, after becoming a crucial part of what has been called the “second wave of emo” in the 90’s along with bands like Braid and The Promise Ring and influencing a list of bands as long as your arm, after 15 years, 4 acclaimed studio albums, a collection of rarities, a live record, numerous 7""s and EPs the Kansas City five piece – Matthew Pryor on vocals and guitar, Rob Pope on bass, Jim Suptic on guitars and vocals, James Dewees on keyboards and Ryan Pope on drums - are excited to unveil ‘There Are Rules’ in 2011, proving that the final chapter for The Get Up Kids has yet to be written.

US population is less than 9x larger than Canada. It’s not about population alone. The US has roughly **12x the economic power** of the Canadians.

The Attorney General has abandoned attempts to secure a hard time-limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the [Irish backstop](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-backstop-irish-border-important-deal1/), The Telegraph has been told.

Ministers briefed on Geoffrey Cox's approach said that those aims, which represent the central demands of Eurosceptics, are considered too ""blunt"" and have been rejected by the European Union.

Some Cabinet ministers are already resigned to the Prime Minister losing a second meaningful vote on her deal amid concerns that changes to the backstop secured by Mr Cox will not be sufficient to win round Brexiteers.

The Attorney General is understood to be focusing on securing an enhanced ""arbitration mechanism"" that allows the UK or the EU to provide formal notice that the backstop should come to an end.

The EU is however resisting demands by British negotiators for an ""independent"" arbitration panel, outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. 

The approach appears to fall short of the demands of a ""star chamber"" of eight Eurosceptics, led by the veteran Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, which will assess the outcome of Mr Cox's negotiations with the European Union and determine whether Theresa May's deal will have the backing of Brexiteers.

In a document detailing their demands they have called for a ""legally-binding"" exit mechanism that will offer a ""clear and unconditional route out of the backstop if trade talks fail"". They have specified this could mean a ""time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism"".

Steve Baker, senior Tory Eurosceptic MP, said that the enhanced arbitration mechanism being considered by Mr Cox also falls short of an amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee.

The amendment, which was passed last month after the Prime Minister's deal was voted down, requires the Irish backstop  to be replaced with alternative arrangements.

Mr Baker told The Daily Telegraph: ""This seems to indicate a satirical approach to fulfilling the Brady amendment which the Government whipped for.  

""The Brady amendment required that you replace the backstop with alternative arrangements. That's light years away from tweaking arbitration mechanisms. Nevertheless I don't want to pre-judge the work of the star chamber.""

Mr Cox and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, will return to Brussels tomorrow for further negotiations.

The Attorney General is seeking changes that are sufficient for him to change his legal advice on the backstop, which stated that it could continue indefinitely.

The Telegraph understands that under Mr Cox's plans, the UK or the EU will be able to provide formal notification that they wish to end the backstop if one side is considered to be acting in bad faith or if ""alternative arrangements"" are in place.

One minister said: ""The problem is that the EU is taking a very absolutist approach. They are saying we can't contract out the integrity of the Single Market to a third party."" 

A diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph that the EU is doing everything it can, including ""acrobatic language"" to reassure the UK, but not amounting to a unilateral exit mechanism or time limit.

Both EU and UK negotiator sources remain downbeat about the prospects for a deal that will satisfy Brexiteers.

The Irish government, which in practice must authorise any concessions on the backstop, remains adamant that any pledges or review mechanism ""cannot cut across the thrust and import"" of the Withdrawal Agreement.

 ""What the UK wants is not the same thing as what the EU is prepared to agree to,"" cautioned a source with knowledge of the negotiations.

Sabine Weyland, the EU's deputy chief negotiator, yesterday highlighted a Tweet stating that the demands of Tory Eurosceptics are ""way beyond what EU negotiators will countenance"".

A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Attorney General continues to pursue legally binding changes to the backstop that are necessary to ensure it cannot be indefinite.

There will be uncertainty about our legal status, people will be told they are just bargaining chips  - again, there will be little certainty about things such as pensions, and a state which is in a way hostile to people who are disabled, old, or are too ill to work. Parents at home are getting older. Family members might need help. Add to that the loss of democratic rights which is never good for a population in the long term. The UK government having trouble with human rights legislation is not a good sign, not at all - it is an early  symptom of authoritarianism. Blaming EU citizens for missing housing or failing resources in health care is much worse. A parliament which is basically disabled by polarised and near violent conflicts is an alarm signal for anyone who knows a bit of continental European history. There is, unfortunately, no natural limit to the damage which is possible if things in the UK and the US continue to develop this way. The prognosticated economic effects of a hard exit with severe job losses, more austerity,  poverty for many, and increased inequality are likely to pour oil on the trash fire of the far right.

And then, there are probably better career opportunities elsewhere for most EU citizens here. People did come from Greece, for example, or from Spain, during the financial crisis, but this crisis is over and the UK government seems to be willing to fabricate a crisis which is even more profound. And add to that the aspect that EU citizens working outside the home country are normally aware and interested in their social environment, and have the experience that changing places is not only feasible but often a gain.

I think many more will go elsewhere.

EB improved the map for RTW, SS improved the map for M2TW. Then there is mods like TAT where there is a completely different map (in that case Middle Earth instead of Europe).

The maps in R2TW and Attila feel so small compared to RTW with EB or M2TW with SS (compare provinces to settlements to have a fair comparison).

In any title after M2TW the map can not be modded. At all. How is that supposed to be ""improved mod support""?

Many of the places that I would have considered worthwhile even 10 years ago, I wouldn't even think of moving to today.

America is a big place.  It's not hard to get lost here, outside of the cities.  They have their surveillance and AI and ever-increasing camera grid, but frankly if you ditch the cell phone you can walk out of the system today and never look back.  Yes, the totalitarian work of several generations' worth of brainwashing in academia is beginning to bear its bitter fruit, but this country is far, far from lost.

That said, there are some places that I would consider on the short list of where to look.

The Czech Republic passed gun rights into their constitution a few years back.  They take freedom and individual liberty very seriously, and the cost of living is so low that economically speaking it would be fairly easy to move there and retire even in mid-life.  They also aren't playing games with this social justice crap like the rest of Europe.

Brazil is fucked-up now, but they may get their shit together in the next 3-5 years.  We'll see.  They are opening up gun rights, perhaps liberty is blossoming, perhaps not, too early to tell.

I'm personally a fan of Ireland, they aren't great on guns but my family has roots there and it is the closest place to ""home"" that I've ever found.  That's worth something.

Switzerland is adopting the social justice crusade.  I would have considered them an option until recently, but no longer.

Argentina I would have considered until recently, apparently they are disintegrating now.  South America in general is a tough call, but the southern hemisphere is notable for having almost zero nuclear reactors, so if something happens to the grid it'll be a lot better to be south of the equator.

Not much of a list, but just some thoughts.",True,False,False,,0,1551652289,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehq7r00,False,t3_awfrq3,True,t3_awfrq3,/r/gunpolitics/comments/awfrq3/where_then_shall_we_go/ehq7r00/,False,,1555431822,2,True,False,gunpolitics,t5_2sumr,r/gunpolitics,public,

Now, to your claims. The facts are that the crew of Helge Ingstad had undergone the British Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) previously that year and passed with overall grade Very Satisfactory. If you do not know, FOST is ""a Royal Navy training organisation responsible for ensuring that Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels are fit to join the operational fleet,"" and is the hallmark of naval training in the western world.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag\_Officer\_Sea\_Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Officer_Sea_Training)

&amp;#x200B;

If you know anything about FOST, you'll know that Very Satisfactory is the top mark a ship can achieve at the conclusion of its training, and is not given lightly by the Brits. Hence, one cannot really claim that the crew was inexperienced. Quite the contrary.

It's a bit tricky to do DC when you've got a 45 meter(!) gash in the hull with progressive flooding, and then as you've started the DC effort there are reports of unexpected flooding through the propeller shafts that start flooding the engine rooms (the before mentioned design flaw), forward of the main DC effort, and cause severe enough flooding that the ship's stability is fatally compromised. You can have all the experience in the world at that point and not really be able to do diddly squat when the laws of physics come into play.
