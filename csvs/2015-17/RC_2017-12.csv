[You can read a little more about it here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_throttling) So no, it's not a fantasy that the US' ISPs will throttle the bandwidth to certain websites or places. Besides, why would they be lobbying so hard to remove it if they won't start controlling which places get better bandwidth and which ones get shafted? That's like trying to get rid of laws against murder and then repeatedly saying ""I promise I won't go and murder anyone, I just want the option to do so"". How suspicious is that? ISPs in the US have a history of lying to their customers and providing false results of what customers are paying for. On top of that the US doesn't even have that good of an ISP system as the US isn't even in the top 10 for average bandwidth, whereas Europe in general has significantly better bandwidth than most US citizens have. ISPs are trying to take a globally ""average"" bandwidth and make it worse.

So yes, it's a pretty big deal to the people who live in the US and possibly the rest of the world as other countries might try to follow suit.

I'm currently in my senior year of high school and was a photo student of an art program called Art Quest. In that class we did both black and white as well as digital photography. The camera I've used in the past and will be using is a Canon T4. My lenses consist of a 85-300mm zoom lens and a 18-55mm wide-angle lens. I understand my equipment as well as editing skills with photoshop and Lightroom. I studied photography throughout my first 3 years of high school so I'd say I can do work on a professional or semi-professional scale. I hope to gain an understanding on how to critique my own work as well as just get as much advice, tips and help as possible.

For a doctor, the USA is a great place to practice. High salaries (though the path there and the hours are insane at times- I'm just a medical student, but I worked 82 hours last week). Also, if you're interested in research like I am, there's a lot of money for research- and the top American research establishments have few peers in the world (most of which are in Europe). SO there is little incentive to move.

Furthermore, it's very difficult to move to most countries to practice. Medical establishments in every country are very powerful and do not like competition. Practicing in the UK requires a waiver from the GMC, which is hard to come by for any country. The American medical system depends on foreign graduates, but most European systems do not. 

So I doubt I'll move anywhere else (except maybe Canada- our degrees are more easily recognized by out maple neighbors). I plan on doing some work for Doctors without borders, but that's more of a temporary volunteer position

[deleted],,,"&gt; If the issue is a belief that the welfare state can't handle providing benefits to all the people living in the country, that's another question. If you support having permanent classes excluded from that, you're not a liberal. 

Citizenship in the United States, as everywhere else, follows established guidelines to serve as a limitation on what would otherwise be an open ended obligation to provide a safety net and other basic protections and services for its citizenry. 

There is nothing about liberalism that mandates the abolishment of borders and the end of national citizenship, as you effectively suggest. To the contrary, history demonstrates that liberal *nations*, not international liberal institutions, are best at promoting and protecting liberal values. It was not the pooled military assets of the liberal nations gathered in the League of Nations (there were no such resources), but rather the armed forces of the United States, that freed Western Europe from the chains of Nazi Germany, for example. 

That international liberal institutions fail to cohere where individual liberal nations succeed is not an accident, but rather an inevitable consequence of human social nature. We trust our neighbors with shared experiences and struggles more readily than we do people we have never met. Nor is this inclination toward neighbor and the familiar a backwards phenomenon seen only in rural insophisticates; urban, educated humans are just as prone to this type of tribal behavior, especially, it might be said, when it comes to the treatment of the aforementioned insophisticates. Nor can this impulse be permanently overcome. 

This is why international institutions, such as the aforementioned League of Nations, lack teeth; it is terribly challenging to get nations to cede their sovereignty and to place their fates in the hands of others. 

And ultimately, this is why the nation-state is the largest human organization able to maintain any sort of internal consistency when it comes to governance. The implication of this reality, that nations are the largest possible unit of social organization capable of preserving and promoting liberalism, comes with the associated cost that there have to be limits on *belonging* to the nation in question if the project is going to be sustainable. That’s because a nation of limited resources that does not, or cannot, prioritize some essential group (its citizenry), finds its ability to meet its financial, social, and security obligations compromised and its legitimacy consequently challenged.

From my experience, people also love to have stuff like guaranteed benefits for X, Y and Z, and don't like to give those benefits up once they have it.  I'm not surprised there is a group, probably even a majority, who like the tradeoffs where they have a financial safety net no matter how they chose to run their life.  Many European governments following WWII out of necessity--versus convenience--created those safety nets, and they are very hard to get rid of once established. 

The US is heading in the same direction--even a majority of Republicans not to long ago were all for government run healthcare.  When people sense they get stuff no matter how hard they work, some legit financial hardships others irresponsible life choices, they tend to want more of it and won't let it go.  It doesn't mean it's the best system, the most productive or efficient system. It's the likely outcome of any elected government that can tax and spend.

The Camp David offer was terrible, it wasn't even remotely good. It was, by all means, good that Arafat refused it:

&gt; To understand what actually happened at Camp David, it’s necessary to know that for many years the PLO has officially called for a two-state solution in which Israel would keep the 78 percent of the Palestine Mandate (as Britain’s protectorate was called) that it has controlled since 1948, and a Palestinian state would be formed on the remaining 22 percent that Israel has occupied since the 1967 war (the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem). Israel would withdraw completely from those lands, return to the pre-1967 borders and a resolution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees who were forced to flee their homes in 1948 would be negotiated between the two sides. Then, in exchange, the Palestinians would agree to recognize Israel (PLO Declaration, 12/7/88; PLO Negotiations Department).

&gt; Although some people describe Israel’s Camp David proposal as practically a return to the 1967 borders, it was far from that. Under the plan, Israel would have withdrawn completely from the small Gaza Strip. But it would annex strategically important and highly valuable sections of the West Bank–while retaining “security control” over other parts–that would have made it impossible for the Palestinians to travel or trade freely within their own state without the permission of the Israeli government (Political Science Quarterly, 6/22/01; New York Times, 7/26/01; Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories, 9-10/00; Robert Malley, New York Review of Books, 8/9/01).
&gt; 
&gt; The annexations and security arrangements would divide the West Bank into three disconnected cantons. In exchange for taking fertile West Bank lands that happen to contain most of the region’s scarce water aquifers, Israel offered to give up a piece of its own territory in the Negev Desert–about one-tenth the size of the land it would annex–including a former toxic waste dump.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the geographic placement of Israel’s proposed West Bank annexations, Palestinians living in their new “independent state” would be forced to cross Israeli territory every time they traveled or shipped goods from one section of the West Bank to another, and Israel could close those routes at will. Israel would also retain a network of so-called “bypass roads” that would crisscross the Palestinian state while remaining sovereign Israeli territory, further dividing the West Bank.
&gt; 
&gt; Israel was also to have kept “security control” for an indefinite period of time over the Jordan Valley, the strip of territory that forms the border between the West Bank and neighboring Jordan. Palestine would not have free access to its own international borders with Jordan and Egypt–putting Palestinian trade, and therefore its economy, at the mercy of the Israeli military.
&gt; 
&gt; Had Arafat agreed to these arrangements, the Palestinians would have permanently locked in place many of the worst aspects of the very occupation they were trying to bring to an end. For at Camp David, Israel also demanded that Arafat sign an “end-of-conflict” agreement stating that the decades-old war between Israel and the Palestinians was over and waiving all further claims against Israel.
&gt; 
&gt; **Violence or negotiation?**
&gt; 
&gt; The Camp David meeting ended without agreement on July 25, 2000. At this point, according to conventional wisdom, the Palestinian leader’s “response to the Camp David proposals was not a counteroffer but an assault” (Oregonian editorial, 8/15/01). “Arafat figured he could push one more time to get one more batch of concessions. The talks collapsed. Violence erupted again” (E.J. Dionne, Washington Post, 12/4/01). He “used the uprising to obtain through violence…what he couldn’t get at the Camp David bargaining table” (Chicago Sun-Times, 12/21/00).
&gt; 
&gt; But the Intifada actually did not start for another two months. In the meantime, there was relative calm in the occupied territories. During this period of quiet, the two sides continued negotiating behind closed doors. Meanwhile, life for the Palestinian population under Israeli occupation went on as usual. On July 28, Prime Minister Barak announced that Israel had no plans to withdraw from the town of Abu Dis, as it had pledged to do in the 1995 Oslo II agreement (Israel Wire, 7/28/00). In August and early September, Israel announced new construction on Jewish-only settlements in Efrat and Har Adar, while the Israeli statistics bureau reported that settlement building had increased 81 percent in the first quarter of 2000. Two Palestinian houses were demolished in East Jerusalem, and Arab residents of Sur Bahir and Suwahara received expropriation notices; their houses lay in the path of a planned Jewish-only highway (Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories, 11-12/00).
&gt; 
&gt; The Intifada began on September 29, 2000, when Israeli troops opened fire on unarmed Palestinian rock-throwers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, killing four and wounding over 200 (State Department human rights report for Israel, 2/01). Demonstrations spread throughout the territories. Barak and Arafat, having both staked their domestic reputations on their ability to win a negotiated peace from the other side, now felt politically threatened by the violence. In January 2001, they resumed formal negotiations at Taba, Egypt.
&gt; 
&gt; The Taba talks are one of the most significant and least remembered events of the “peace process.” While so far in 2002 (1/1/02-5/31/02), Camp David has been mentioned in conjunction with Israel 35 times on broadcast network news shows, Taba has come up only four times–never on any of the nightly newscasts. In February 2002, Israel’s leading newspaper, Ha’aretz (2/14/02), published for the first time the text of the European Union’s official notes of the Taba talks, which were confirmed in their essential points by negotiators from both sides.
&gt; 
&gt; “Anyone who reads the European Union account of the Taba talks,” Ha’aretz noted in its introduction, “will find it hard to believe that only 13 months ago, Israel and the Palestinians were so close to a peace agreement.” At Taba, Israel dropped its demand to control Palestine’s borders and the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians, for the first time, made detailed counterproposals–in other words, counteroffers–showing which changes to the 1967 borders they would be willing to accept. The Israeli map that has emerged from the talks shows a fully contiguous West Bank, though with a very narrow middle and a strange gerrymandered western border to accommodate annexed settlements.
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, however, all this proved too much for Israel’s Labor prime minister. On January 28, Barak unilaterally broke off the negotiations. “The pressure of Israeli public opinion against the talks could not be resisted,” Ben-Ami said (New York Times, 7/26/01).
&gt; 
&gt; **Settlements off the table**
&gt; 
&gt; In February 2001, Ariel Sharon was elected prime minister of Israel. Sharon has made his position on the negotiations crystal clear. “You know, it’s not by accident that the settlements are located where they are,” he said in an interview a few months after his election (Ha’aretz, 4/12/01).
&gt; 
&gt; They safeguard the cradle of the Jewish people’s birth and also provide strategic depth which is vital to our existence.The settlements were established according to the conception that, come what may, we have to hold the western security area [of the West Bank], which is adjacent to the Green Line, and the eastern security area along the Jordan River and the roads linking the two. And Jerusalem, of course. And the hill aquifer. Nothing has changed with respect to any of those things. The importance of the security areas has not diminished, it may even have increased. So I see no reason for evacuating any settlements.
&gt; Meanwhile, Ehud Barak has repudiated his own positions at Taba, and now speaks pointedly of the need for a negotiated settlement “based on the principles presented at Camp David” (New York Times op-ed, 4/14/02).
&gt; 
&gt; In April 2002, the countries of the Arab League–from moderate Jordan to hardline Iraq–unanimously agreed on a Saudi peace plan centering around full peace, recognition and normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for a complete Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders as well as a “just resolution” to the refugee issue. Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha’ath declared himself “delighted” with the plan. “The proposal constitutes the best terms of reference for our political struggle,” he told the Jordan Times (3/28/02).
&gt; 
&gt; Ariel Sharon responded by declaring that “a return to the 1967 borders will destroy Israel” (New York Times, 5/4/02). In a commentary on the Arab plan, Ha’aretz‘s Bradley Burston (2/27/02) noted that the offer was “forcing Israel to confront peace terms it has quietly feared for decades.”

Except it was the Serbs who were raped by the ottomans.

We don't cover up our women, we have normal ages of consent, we have normal courts and no sharia. Also I never claimed Islam is European, I just said it is the only comparison one could make with Bosnia and middle eastern or Turkish countries. Outside of the religion, which isn't even practiced the same way, is there any comparisons you can make between Bosnians and Turks? Cuz there's quite a few to be made about Serbs

A few people make it into  Europe, then send word home to all their cousins that they should come to Europe too.

yottalogical,,,"North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

The nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. Investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene.

Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called ISIS, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

A report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

The FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the airwaves auction.

AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products. 

During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

#IN A NUTSHELL:

There _was_ Net Neutrality before 2015 by having ISPs classified under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934. However, this wasn’t good enough, to the point where Verizon successfully sued the FCC saying Title I had basically no authority over them. This is why ISPs were then classified under Title II, to sustain the Net Neutrality that already existed.",True,0,1512096313,,False,0,dql9xam,False,t3_7gctcv,t1_dqix66l,/r/Jokes/comments/7gctcv/lady_her_130k_mercedes/dql9xam/,1514217480,1,False,Jokes,t5_2qh72,public,

1. I'm not a fan of these science-y explanations. They always sound lame to me. You can make a cool story about the mythical explanation of spring and winter, but try to do the same with the scientific explanation of it...

2. I also dislike how most science-y explanations use scientific terminology in bizarre ways. Sure, if Toriyama wants S-Cells to be inherited from the father he can do it, but couldn't he use a different name (like S-Genes) for something that is inherited from the father in real life?

3. I'm not a fan of this kind of explanation at all. I'm of the school that prefers stories to have lots of empty space around them, so that they can feel more mysterious and interesting. That's why I have always disliked the EU for Star Wars: it manages to make the world feel both smaller and less interesting, while adding a ton of mostly mediocre content...

ManBooble,,,"Thomas Jefferson also lived in a time where this manner of thinking was prevalent. You think you're telling me something new that the founders and others thought of themselves as superior to other races. Of course they did. Jefferson owned slaves, for fucks sake. I specifically said that equality under the law was later expanded/developed upon to encompass -all- people. That doesn't mean that the founders or the people who thought this way of that time period were ""right"" any more than the people who were certain that the earth was flat were ""right"" when it was later proven it wasn't. You're telling me that the people of colonial America thought of themselves as superior to blacks and the indigenous. You may as well tell me that water is wet. Their entire world view was centered around their own culture, as is EVERY person's from their own culture compared to another's especially in times as this when they were more starkly isolated. Human beings have inherent xenophobic tendencies because our social structures evolved to focus around our family, tribal, and racial/cultural/ethnic groups, but HAVING that tendency does not bring truth to the claim that people are unequal in the IDEA that they have ""god given potential"" within the context of their environment. A western born person of any color can excel according to their own merit given the resources their cultural context provides. There are, of course, constrains within certain socio-economic factors (a man born into riches clearly has an advantage but he may also not be very capable, whereas a poor man may have the tenacity to excel beyond his status)... but typically a western man will grow to exhibit behavior fostered by his culture, where a man in subsaharan africa will grow to exhibit the behavior fostered by *his* culture and set by the limitations of his environment (via resource access) that cannot be overcome by merit-driven progress. Why is it you think that people are not born equal of potential when clearly we have people who have succeeded within the contexts of their own culture, by their own merit, of every race and creed? 

Or are you saying because Jefferson didn't understand that when you have a population of blacks that were deliberately kept from access to education, who were subject to generations of enslavement and a life of labor and servitude, that this has very real and lasting effects (damage) to the development in mental health and cognition? That even before that, they came from an area of the world and a culture which had no access to resources that permitted the advancement technologically to be on par with Europe at this time? And yet somehow in the modern world, with the growing equalization of access to resources and education, some of the brightest people in the world are blacks/non-whites (scientists, etc.). But if you had kept them in the same status as they were in Jefferson's times, you would find the results not to be much different from what he described. To say nothing that you find similar ""dimness"" in people of exceptional poverty even in the developed world for their lack of access to beneficial resources such as good nutrition, reasonable work, and education.

You are absolutely lost on this subject and the causes for these differences. Out of your depth, and frankly, confused on basic meanings and interpretations. I urge you, if you're in college, maybe try to get some access to some anthropological courses, for that entire FIELD is dedicated to the study of human beings, their differences, and the causes for these differences.

ZizeksPoorNose,,,"&gt;I see the first step as a return to greater subsidiarity. Make the states more like independent nations, and the Union more like the EU. Redraw some of the state lines to better encapsulate more alike peoples. Allow each state to control it's own immigration policy, while allowing for some kind of travel between states system. Also allow some isolated 99% white communities to set themselves as essentially all white reservations and buy out the 1 or 2 non-whites with imminent domain which we do all the time already.


Alright so we're in fairy tale political land now, got it. We're not going to see states rights come back like this ever. Power is already too centralized and neither party is *actually* interested in divesting it at this point, it's too politically advantageous for both of them now. Not to mention it doesn't make much sense given globalization. 

Again, ethnocentrists are all theory, everything seems to fall apart when you actually talk about reality because you need violence to make it work and there won't ever be political will for that kind of violence on a large scale.

Mind you I haven't even touched the question of morality in any of this, which let's be real is extremely hard to justify as well. The best I usually see done is usually eye for eye logic, which is flawed to begin with.

The reason I chose Mapping and Equipment is because I find the thrill of playing a fantasy setting is often the simulation of being in a different world, and I want to take away the tedium that inhibits imagination; particularly by giving a clear, simplified system for interacting with the world on a economical/logistical level, since that is a common ground I find me and my friends understand.

&amp;nbsp;

Specifically, the logistics of travel, encumbrance, intelligence gathering and the economics of being a savior to the people, as well as what that status entitles the players to, are all mundane things that I enjoy, and want to simplify into a common ground between the player and the GM through a shared bedrock of mechanics referenced by all levels of the system.

&gt;Samuel Francis argued that the problems of managerial state extend to issues of crime and justice. In 1992, he introduced the word “anarcho-tyranny” into the paleocon vocabulary.[10] He once defined it this way: “we refuse to control real criminals (that's the anarchy) so we control the innocent (that's the tyranny).”[11] Francis argued that this situation extends across the U.S. and Europe. While the government functions normally, violent crime remains a constant, creating a climate of fear (anarchy). He says that “laws that are supposed to protect ordinary citizens against ordinary criminals” routinely go unenforced, even though the state is “perfectly capable” of doing so. While this problem rages on, government elites concentrate their interests on law-abiding citizens. In fact, Middle America winds up on the receiving end of both anarchy and tyranny.[10]",True,0,1512103550,,False,0,dqlfy8i,False,t3_7gr7nj,t3_7gr7nj,/r/The_Donald/comments/7gr7nj/kate_steinle_murderer_not_guilty_time_for_the/dqlfy8i/,1514221004,3,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,public,

callsign__iceman,,,"Mhm.
A little webcam was set on top of a monitor that tracked my eye movement or some shit like that, the therapist then pretended to not pay attention (maybe that’s not part of the test but it seemed intentional because he knew to a tee exactly what I was doing even though it looked like he was spaced out.) I, at first, was shown the number “1.” Every time it appeared, I clicked it. I had a nice reaction speed, but this is where the test started to make my skin itch- if you double clicked, a very slow and methodical voice chokes out “Please. Do. Not. Click. The. Left. Mouse. Button. Twice.” 
I naturally just double click everything, so then I had to be very delicate and just single click everything and my reaction time tanked.

The second part of the test was the worst. The slow narrator would explain that either based on sound or sight, you click the button. That’s all well and good, except it shows you separate numbers or you hear a separate number from what your shown. The conflicting information made my blood boil- I would double click, then the computer scolded me for that. At the end of the test, it showed my eye movement which instead of being focused on the center, had apparently been tracked all over the monitor (though admittedly I am a curious person by my nature so when I am told to observe, I look everywhere except right under my nose. Sometimes I’m a good investigator, other times I can’t find my glasses that I’m actually wearing.) He then paired the results with the self evaluation sheet and the evaluation sheet given to my mother. I had to convince him to throw her sheet out tho, because she is also extremely adhd and basically checked off everything on the list, including the section on homicidal tendencies, giving me a “5” which was the highest you can score, despite the fact I have only been in three fist fights in my life and the only person whose life I threatened was a former friend that fucked my girlfriend only a day prior to me discovering (then he lied to my face about it) I hardly consider that homicidal tendencies and the therapist agreed. He then told me that I shouldn’t fear, because despite the fact that my score was on the Autism
Spectrum in Europe, many people score as adhd on that test and one of the lowest scorer was a NASA scientist. I don’t know if the latter part is true or not, but my friends in Germany confirmed the former over XBL when I asked them about it. 

I was quick to inform the old fart that I was about to chuck his fucking computer out of the fucking window because I couldn’t double click and he began to laugh and then said “-I was worried I would need a new mouse button because of how pissed off you were getting.”


Pretty sure that’s everything that happened, the test took roughly 20 minutes and the two evaluation sheets were given out three months prior to the test. I overdosed shortly after being evaluated as adhd so my wait on a prescription was halved- which surprised me since I OD’d on meth (even if it was an accident since I thought it was coke, I didn’t expect for them to give me my adderall after that.) hope this is enough detail for yah- it’s been a while, because I did all of that bullshit before I graduated, then I OD’d and was in recovery for two weeks and went back early because I needed to graduate, which was in early 2016...didn’t get my first prescription until a month or two later I think. I was on only two 10mg a day when battlefield 4 was ported to the xbone and was free with gold, dlc included- I remember staying up for 14 hours because my old account didn’t port over from the 360, but my XP boosters did, and with the 200% weekend booster on top of them, I went from level one to level 135. It was like, 15 hours of straight BF4 and then I took several Benadryl and knocked out. Now two 10mgs might be enough to buzz me a little bit, but it would do fuck all over the the whole day. Probably would make me want to have a nap time after four hours to be honest 😂

Tartyron,POLA,Poland,"TRANSLATION

In Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary **there is a new sense of self-esteem, resulting from both economic success and attachment to traditional values: family, nation and religion,** ""writes Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Thursday.
""There was a time when Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks were considered primitives in eastern Europe,"" writes the author Karl-Peter Schwarz.

Recalls that in contrast to Bulgaria, Romania and the West-Balkan countries, Prague, Budapest, Bratislava and Warsaw have made a successful transition in 2004 and entered the European Union in 2004.

""In the 13th year of their membership in the Union these four countries have become (yet) pariahs."" The gap between the Visegrad Group (V4) and the countries that are in the EU continues to deepen, ""Schwarz adds, adding that one reason The fact that the Hungarians and the Poles, and recently also the Czechs, ""have ceased to choose as the West wants.""

Schwarz notes that Viktor Orban's Hungarian Prime Minister is often mentioned in the West with the Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Poland does not suffer this because of the nationalist conservatism under the influence of Catholicism, and the secular Czechs are asked with surprise as to why they chose the Slovakian billionaire Prime Minister.

According to commentator Andrej Babisz, he won the election as the current president of France Emmanuel Macron - with a movement directed at traditional parties, which - he notes - is called populism. **""Only the pragmatism of Babis power is considered a populist, while Macron is considered a politician who has saved his country from populism,"" critically acclaims the author.**


Addressing the problem of migration, the commentator points to a completely different interpretation of the concept of ""solidarity"" in the west and east of the EU. **Most EU countries have agreed to the allocation of refugees as ""an order of European solidarity"", while the Visegrad Group countries interpret solidarity as ""the EU's commitment to defend Europe against mass migration from Africa and Asia"".**

**From the point of view of V4, not Merkel is promoting solidarity, but Orban** - says Schwarz. The threat of cutting EU funds increases only the resistance of these countries aggainst the quotas  - he adds.

According to Schwarz, the ""new self-esteem"" of countries in eastern Central Europe is based on two premises - material and ideological. ""Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are thriving economies,"" says Schwarz. The EU is perceived as ""less and less as a chance, more and more as a ball"", he notes.

As he stresses, ""people's minds"" are more important, who have been twice exposed to the ""long march"" to be the ""new man"".

The inhabitants of these countries were firstly ""victims of communist civil engineers"" and then subjected to ""neo-liberal planners from the EU and the IMF."" **After the turnout in 1989 the local Communists ""quickly adapted to the new times"", but continued a long march instead of ""more socialism"" postulating now ""more Europe"", writes the commentator.**

iampattym,,,"&gt;But what about us Asians? 

I think the main reason they don't like Jews is the perceived nepotism. IDK if it actually happens but I'm inclined to maybe believe it, not because of race, but because of the tight nit communities they have. Asians don't seem to have the same amount of nepotism, they generally go into STEM fields which doesn't give them any power over the public and they race-mix more than jews (not an actual stat that I know I'm just assuming). They don't seem to have the ethnocentrism that the ethnos admire in the Jews.

&gt;They may be afraid of Jews, but if they do something about Jewish people - i.e. if a Hitler 2.0 actually does come around and give them what these nutters want, you can bet that Asians, especially Far East Asians would be next on the chopping block in the utopia of their white ethnostate.

As far as I can tell about those who are forward they just want people gone. Jews in Israel, asians in asia, blacks in Africa and whites in europe. That's the kind of *benevolent* part of the alt-right.  In theory they just want everyone to love their own race and be with their own race. The common analogy used is:

&gt;when your parents watched you play at the park do you think they loved you more than the other kids?

To which the response is always ""yes""

&gt;well do you think that meant he hated the other kids? You see race is a lot like that, a big family.

Unfortunately a lot of ethnos have abandoned the ""benevolent"" part because they see other races as an obstacle to their own survival

spectemur,,,"Jumping on this for the sake of - since this thread has drifted into ""what do the far right actually believe about race"" - offering another wrinkle to it.

There is another faction within the far right - one that is typically *much* further right than the Alt-Right generally and, of note, also a faction I'd probably qualify as part of... so I can speak with good faith on the matter - that responds to the question of race realism with ""If true so what?"" To explain:

For many of us in the ""ultra-nationalist"" sphere the right of *every* racial demographic to an ancestral ethnostate to call their own is regarded - as things like the right to bear arms and the right to free speech might be to a Classical Liberal - as a basic *human* right that does not discriminate on the basis of supposed inferiority or superiority of any given ethnic group even *if* such distinctions can be established. Even *if* the Alt-Right could prove - categorically and beyond refute - that peoples of European extraction were genetically superior to Somalians, for example, it would not give peoples of European extraction the moral right to enter Somalia on mass and deprive Somalian peoples of that, for lack of a better term, God given birthright. The inverse is also true; even if it were to turn out that all Syrians were 300 IQ, hyper civilized superhumans whose very presence would trigger a golden age of technological advancement that does not give them the *right* to deprive the German peoples of their ethnic super-majority status in their ancestral homelands. 

In summary: for many of us the question of ""race realism"" is regarded as entirely superfluous to the moral arguments in favor of ethnostates. The fundamental human right of blood and soil does not *care* if you're a drooling cave person or a technocratic uberman. The principle applies equally to all human beings regardless. Truthfully, for many of us in the sphere of Neo-Reaction the whole ""race realism"" thing is actually kind of a shit test. It demonstrates either:

a] In the case of Alt-Righters who advocate it? You've failed the litmus test. You're either part of the far right out of your own sense of insecurity - obsessing over whether or not your people are superior to other people as a way to bolster your own ego rather than advocating for what is *best* for your people - or you're not yet completely educated on why it is you advocate for what you advocate. Hit the books, cuck.

or b] In the case of people like Kraut that have become lolcow levels of obsessed with refuting it? It's a sign of their utter inability to meaningfully engage with the more meaty, substantial moral questions posited by far right doctrine. It's like strawmaning but not *quite* because some within the far right genuinely *do* believe in race realism... I suppose I'd describe it as a cynical fixation upon the perceived ""easy win"" of race realism - something utterly outside the Overton Window and not even a consensus among the far right - that allows him to proclaim to have ""PWNED THE ALT-RIGHT!"" while wriggling away from answering our more fundamental questions:

""What moral justification is there for expecting any given ethnicity to become a minority population within their ancestral homelands? Why is it ethically acceptable for a state to impose by force policies that will *make* this so irrespective of the wishes of the native population they are, in theory, empowered to serve? What are the material distinctions between these aforementioned *imposed* policies and enabling colonization? If elected officials are going to ignore the will of the native population who empowered them is not the social contract already void and the autocracy you fear from us *already* here? Why would such an outcome - native populations becoming minorities in their ancestral homelands - be pragmatically desirable or worthwhile? What are the *benefits* of multiculturalism and multiracial societies? What do they create for societies besides internal division, balkanization, inevitable race wars and... admittedly tasty kebabs?""

the_gnarts,DE-BW,Laurasia,"&gt; I still don't understand why the EU is funding 6 month party trips for a handful of people when an 8×1,5 hour language course costs €130 at my uni.

For one, you’re doing it wrong. In my experience (different
country though), teachers at the language departments will
let you take part in courses for free if you just ask
them nicely. Just avoid the uni’s “language center” because
they’re a ripoff geared towards students whose degree
requires a language credit they need to tick off. Language
departments have better teachers and courses that also
progress faster because they can assume a familiarity with
linguistics and grammatical teminology in general.

Regarding Erasmus, it depends on the requirements their
home university has and their motivation. There definitely
is a large number of trash people without any interest
whatsoever in local language or culture of their destination.
But it’s an *exchange*. That means, the partner institute
gets to send their most motivated students to another
country, thereby offering them a chance to move up
academically. The price to pay is of course taking in a small,
manageable party crowd every semester.

It’s also worth pointing out that some Erasmus spots are the
product of decades long cooperation between two departments,
often smaller ones. The partners have a vested interest in not
ruining that relationship by sending over a bunch of morons
so they’d rather let a spot remain unused for a semester than
awarding it to the wrong person.

They adopted broken mechanics something called animation cancelling which gives huge adventage to people who lives nearby of the megaservers and with top shelve CPU. Also macro users abusing it which againts the rules but ZOS cant do anything about it also there is a side effect bug called macroslicing people say its only visual bug for the caster but its not true it happens to victims too i experienced a lot and there are videos in youtube about being a victim of a macroslice just do a google search ""macroslice"" and you will see. I would definetly stop playing this game if there is a better alternative but there isnt and its free of sub. Only WoW and i played that game like 10 years so no for me.

TwstdSail,,,"Hi Joyrider,

Awesome that you've decided to go sailing, and kudos to you for having decided to learn first, rather than just going out there and crashing around.

So full disclosure... I work for US Sailing as an Instructor. That being said, the advice here is really spot on. There are a lot of great sailing organizations around the world, and RYA is amazing and good folks, and certainly getting their certifications will set you onto a great path.

The ICC (as mentioned already) is a key to chartering around the world. You can get it from any reputable school. My school offers it, RYA offers it at all their schools, so does every national organization in Europe. In a lot of countries you simply cannot charter without it.

I'm a big supporter of US Sailing. Not just because I work there (I work with them because I believe in their methods), but because they are out there trying to make sailing education better. Again however, that being said, it's very school to school. With some schools it's very site to site specific. If you told me you were in Seattle, I would send you to a great ASA school. In San Francisco, to a great US Sailing School. In New England there are more than a few programs that are really very very good. One of the biggest schools in the country varies wildly in their quality from site to site. It's about the school.

As to the certification; US Sailing isn't as well known as RYA, but it's better respected than ASA (they had some really bad ideas at start up that helped them grow, but did a lot of damage to their brand long term).

But here is what we know. You cannot learn to sail in a few hours. You should plan to spend at least 8 or 10 days just to get basically comfortable with boats. Then it's a matter of practice. Our course (to get the ICC and US Sailings Bare Boat certification) requires 12 class days and 10 days sailing with your own friends. It's not easy, but when you leave us, you know what you are doing. You've spent time learning engines, how to sail at night, how to navigate from a chart and from a plotter. You've learned to sail, to motor, to anchor and dock. There is a lot to learn before you borrow someone else's boat.

So a couple of things: 

1) learn on smaller boats. Even just 4 or 5 days on them will make you a significantly better sailor. Smaller boats give you a better sense of feel, they teach you how to listen. Getting onto a 50 isn't going to do that for you. How small? Well, depends, but I would say that the biggest thing you want to learn on initially is something like a Colgate 26 or a J/24. You'll really understand what wind and water is about if you do that. THEN move up to a bigger or wheeled boat.

2) Like anything, this takes time. If a school tells you they can have you ready to charter in 4 or 5 days, my advice is to take their brochure, smile, thank them pleasantly, and then find somewhere else to learn.

3) Time on a boat really helps. You can't learn it from a book, or a powerpoint. You have to be on a boat. More to the point, you need 'Tiller Time.' If you're in a class for 8 hours, with 5 other people, that means your 8 hour day probably has you on the tiller less than 30 minutes. Tiller time counts.

4) Finally, a lot of learning to sail is about experiencing things. Experience sailing in 3kts, and in 30kts. Learn the difference between 10 second periods and 7 second periods. Sail, sail, sail. Because what you'll experience cruising in the Adriatic is very different from the coast of Maine. 

So find a school you trust, and make some friends. Then go get practice, sail with friends, join a club, go sailing. It will change your life.

imagine63,,Canon 50mm f/1.4 FD lens,"I have re-read the post, and trying to understand where it's coming from. 

Several things I noted.

We don't have a lack of spices. Rather, there is a mistake in thinking that we need a lot of spices. Technically, spices are dried or powdered natural food added for flavor and to keep the food ""fresh."" If it is not dried, then it is an aromatic, meaning that it is fresh leaves. When you dry the aromatic, it becomes a spice. Like oregano and basil.

The main purpose of a spice is to preserve the food. This is important in a temperate climate. It is also important to preserve food in a desert environment. This is one reason European and Middle Eastern cuisine is heavily spiced. This point is important. 

As late as the 1990s, most Filipino housewives still go to market daily for their fresh food ingredients even if they have refrigerators. The food is bought fresh in the morning and cooked for lunch and dinner. As a general rule, we have fresher ingredients in the market than what Europeans or Americans have. This is also the case in most places where they value flavor, like Japan, Italy and France. 

We do produce cinnamon but we don't use it as much. We don't produce saffron, which is very expensive. We also don't produce mustard (sauce) but we have mustard leaves. Pinoys also do not think highly of paprika. The leaves and aromatics are important to consider when talking about Filipino food. There is a flavor profile in the leaves. We have assorted leaves and flowers with distinct flavors like ampalaya, calabasa (talbos), kangkong, camote (talbos), malunggay, gabi (tuyong dahon), saluyot, katuray and others. Consider the flavor profile of anchoviesv (dilis), squid, tuyo and tinapa. These are rich in umami, and you only need a little to add flavor to malunggay soup, or mongo.

We also have other non-western aromatics, like tanglad, calamansi, cashew fruit, green mangoes, kamias, guava and tamarind.

I would also like to point out that the dish which most represents southern France is bouillabaisse. The chef/owner of one of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in Marseille goes up the hills and picks fresh aromatics from wild plants to put in his dishes. Bouillabaisse uses an assortment of fishes and shellfish which constitute the day's catch that was not sold in the market. These leftovers are used to make a delicious soup, along with freshly picked herbs.

This is the same idea behind local cuisine, like pinakbet and other soup based Pinoy dishes.

Yes we are unlike our neighbors. We don't have laksa or curry. We have kare-kare using leftover meat cuts like offal and tail. We have sisig, which is pork cheeks and ears. We have dinuguan which uses entrails and pig's blood. 

You are correct in your observation that we are unlike our neighbors.",True,0,1512113623,,False,0,dqllomk,False,t3_7glz0n,t3_7glz0n,/r/Philippines/comments/7glz0n/spices_in_filipino_food/dqllomk/,1514224304,9,False,Philippines,t5_2qjov,public,

2) Læser du overhovedet de ting, du støver op? Din Guardian-artikel (nov. 2015) beskriver housing cost, ikke leje. Og hvis du så ellers gad bruge tid på at skimme den rapport, som artiklen henviser, så ville du se (hvilket artiklen i øvrigt også beskriver i lidt mindre grad):

&gt;In modern developed economies, housing is both a consumer good and a capital good, and
the greater the level of housing deregulation, the more tightly housing is integrated into the market economy [...]
&gt; However, as a consequence of housing being a capital good, market demand is driven not only by a need for homes, but also by investor demand, which distorts the market of housing as a consumer good. Housing becomes less affordable as market demand becomes heavily influenced by investment motives, which is illustrated by the evolution of house prices compared with GDP growth in most European countries.

Så konklusionen fra rapporten er faktisk, at det er private investeringer i boliger med henblik på gevinst, der har været med til at presse priserne opad.

Samme rapport nævner i øvrigt igen London som den absolut mest pressede by i forhold til housing costs. Igen, så beder jeg dig forholde dig til, hvordan det nu kan lade sig gøre, når de netop IKKE har prisregulering af lejen i London?

Som skrevet tidligere, så synes jeg, det er rigtig fint, at man har en politisk holdning, også en nyliberal, men den skal også være funderet i viden, ikke bare en række artikler, hvor man lige har læst overskriften. Og når man så bliver udfordret på sine holdninger, så er det altså også en demokratisk pligt at forholde sig til, om ens holdning til et emne så rent faktisk skal justeres ind.

Agreed

&gt;They are still one of our biggest rivals and by extension biggest threats globally so having bases in that region of the world to respond to them is still important. 

Their only base in the region is in Western Syria and unlike the Cold War the Russians don't have the Stans, Georgia or Azerbaijan under their rule so Moscow's ability to project power in the Middle East is limited. Turkey and other regional powers easily check Russian power in the Middle East.   Furthermore; Russia now has to contend with NATO in the Baltic so their focus will have to be on Europe not the Middle East. 

&gt;And as you say China is the biggest importer from that region now, and they are our other top rival.

Exactly, so why should the US protect their oil? If the Middle East oil stopped flowing China's economy would be crippled and it would no longer be a serious challenge to American power.

The threat from Russia and China are a large part of why I think the US's Middle East-centric foreign policy is obsolete. When the US is facing two great power rivals devoting so many resources to contain Iran is misguided. The US should reorient its foreign policy to focus on Europe and the Pacific instead. Every dollar that goes to the Persian Gulf is not going to the South China Sea or the Baltics.

Literally nothing that the Dutch didn't also do to the African natives, which you just defended in the immediately preceding sentence, you fucking savage.  

&gt;sex trafficking, acid attacks, grenade attacks, truck attacks, mass shootings, mutilating the bodies, raping children, and on and on.

Gotta face facts, mate. Nonwhite immigrants contribute more to Europe than you ever could. You're poor and uneducated enough that it's simply a matter of objective fact. Evidently they're also less prone to crime, seeing as how you have a record and they overwhelmingly do not.

Aconserva3,,,"Specifically Europe, It’s not about job loss, it’s about the sense of entitlement, living off welfare with hardly any getting jobs, crimes amongst migrants at a much much higher rate then locals, and of course every job lost to a migrant is one less European in the work force, every European killed in a terrorist attack is one less European who would otherwise be alive. These random acts of terror on random people does not happen by the locals on nearly the same scale, there’s been hardly any mass shootings, bombings, truck attacks, on random people for political, ideological, or religious aims by the locals. 

The mass migration brings with it terrorism, mass migrant crime, such as the Pakistani rape/grooming gangs in the UK, the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, and leeches off the society expecting us to give them everything. 

Even terrorism, something relatively rare yes, especially in Europe, not so in the Middle East, of the 70,000,000 or so people in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria, around 100,000 (before ISIS died) were members of ISIS, the Taliban, or other radical groups like the Al Nusra Front, around 0.15% of the population. Actively involved in extremist groups. Countless more are exposed to this violence, and millions of innocent people have suffered. 

In many more religious Islamic countries (ie not Kosovo, Albania, Azerbaijan, Malaysia or Turkey. I wonder why crime and terrorism is not such a big problem from these Islamic countries) support for Sharia law is very high, more then 50% of the population, a lot higher on men we can assume, these countries are the same ones we are importing millions of people from. They are bringing the same beliefs, the same culture, the same violence they are fleeing (although most of the migrants are not refugees, not all of them are from the three countries mentioned before) 

Military aged men are the biggest issue, but since no one is willing to just import women and children, it’s in our best interests to stop this “oh look how nice I am” cult of diversity to end. Yes, diversity is good. But just because something is diverse doesn’t immediately make it good. Small, controlled, strict refugee numbers I can get behind, maybe, but even then, what’s the point? Making a few people’s lives better? Oh good. But for every person we bring here, ten more are left behind in the violence, hatred, oppression, and racism that is rampant in these countries.

If you're talking of white people or those with ''high'' IQ - look no further than the Soviet Union, which can only be regarded as economically and intelectually stunning half of Europe for half a century.

Mate, all people, regardless of skin colour, have the possibility to be productive, to be geniouses etc. Obviously Africa is in a rut right now, no wonder - their economies rely primarly on raw resources. If you're the one feeding China raw materials so that they can make 2 dollar headphones - what do you think ''trickles down'' to the African enterprises and their workers?

The way how different parts of the world have different development speeds can be attributed to a lot of things, including culture, but, in my opinion, primarly, history. The Latvians aren't genetically inferior to the Dutch. The Japanese are not genetically superior beings to the Filipinos - it's different historical circumstances that have pushed them along a certain development route that has resulted in conditions that help prosperity.

Cicatrice_,TAAF,Terres australes et antarctiques,"En fait j'ai tiqué au moment de l'épisode TVA sur la petite voiture. Je suis travailleur frontalier (Luxembourg), alors des voitures qui passent la frontière, on en entend régulièrement parler.

Dans l'émission, Langlet soutient qu'un véhicule qui coûte aujourd'hui 49000€ en France, coûterait demain 54000€ avec la nouvelle TVA proposée par JLM, alors qu'il serait toujours possible d'aller l'acheter à 49000€ en Belgique, en Espagne ou ailleurs. Mélenchon a botté en touche, arguant que quand on balance autant d'argent dans une voiture, on est plus à 6000€ près.

En réalité, d'après la directive européenne suivante : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/AUTO/?uri=celex:32006L0112 un véhicule neuf, ou qui a moins de six mois ou moins de 6000km doit voir sa TVA facturée dans son pays d'immatriculation.

Ce pays d'immatriculation doit correspondre au pays de résidence principale de son propriétaire. 

Il existe un simulateur plus accessible qu'un texte législatif sur le site de l'Union Européenne : http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/cars/vat-buying-selling-cars/index_fr.htm

But even the term White Supremacy is loaded.

But when it comes to White Supremacy, this is instantly delegated to Aryan supremacy over ""inferior"" races based on ""christian"" values or Neo-Nazism.  

Even without tying it those extremes, White Supremacy is still then tide to Western European Colonialism and its willingness and ability to dominate other cultures throughout the last Six Hundred Years, nevermind any other culture or civilization that dominated/spread within their respective regions because this is what Humans DO.    Europeans were just really successful at it, for better or for worse.

While there's merit to justifying being against ""White Supremacy"" in such places as Canada, United States, and Australia; since they are colonies and not origins, Whites cannot even be considered Supreme within their Origin lands in Europe like Asians, Latins, and Africans within their respective Origins.

So among the 3 billion base pairs in the Human genome, about 2 to 3 million would differ from individual to individual. Among this variation, around 86-90% is between individuals on each continent, while 10-14% is variation that is found between individuals from different continents (Africa, Europe, Asia). Therefore, if you think that a variation of 1 nucleotide in 10,000 (10% of 1/1000), is sufficient to be considered a race, then there you go, you have it.

Falc7,,,"&gt; The UK’s debt is money the UK has already borrowed to fund spending within the UK (mainly) or by the government. The EU’s liabilities (it cannot hold sovereign debt because it is not a sovereign) are in effect future commitments to spend on projects (eg airports in Poland that nobody uses). This distinct from debt. These are future liabilities yet to be incurred with the ultimate asset they will be offset against remaining in the EU, with the UK having no share of it. Of course it’s different.

You are wrong, some are future commitments, but some are past (such as pensions). Either way why do you think this matters. You can enter a contract in the past signing you up to make a transaction in the future, and thereby obtaining debt that you become liable in the future (think pension commitments). That is effectively what happens in the EU. 

&gt; About what

I asked you to explain why you think only 'sovereign nations' can sign up for join liabilities. Ok I see you explain it here in the next paragraph:

&gt;   No - it’s a hugely important distinction. The EU cannot borrow in its own right: the EU hasn’t really borrowed in its own right either. Its commitments are made by it on behalf of its members: a government funds its borrowing through taxation on the people. The EU doesn’t have a right to anything.

The EU can and does makes commitments to pay money in the future. There is nothing in moral code or economics that supports that support issuing debt as being in any way necessary to take on point liabilities.

I'm not even sure the point you are arguing at this point. I am sure you agree that the EU can and does make commitments for future payments (again, think pension commitments) so it obviously has that power. 

Imagine an official that has worked his whole life for the EU and all that while served the UK during that time, and he is now retired. You think the UK should just tell him we are not to going to pay our share of his salary? We may not be in the EU in the future, but we've benefited and committed to making these type of payments in the past for services rendered in the past.

&gt;“The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides expressly in Article 70.1(b) that a termination of a treaty does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.

SEOLJL,,,"I was quite young 8 or 9 at the time. In a busy intersection around a large railroad. Just sitting on the side of the road. I see this old man with a suitcase and a straw hat pretty much wobble his way towards the crossing. The stop sign is on red and he just incredibly slowly starts walking across the street. The journey to the otherside of the road is about 12 meters give or take .. at the rate he was going he would need 2 minutes to get there. I'm just staring at him during his entire trip. He gets about half way and very slowly kneels. A big ass truck enters the intersection. This was in the early 90s somewhere in eastern Europe so those trucks weren't great and it wasn't exactly a new model to begin with. The driver sees him kneeled in the middle of the street and starts honking. Keeps the exact same speed ... while honking like a madman. As far as I recall the street wasn't awfully crowded so he could have swirled one way or the other but just kept going instead. This truck was quite lifted of the ground and.. well as the old man was kneeled it hit him directly in the forehead. He leaned back from the impact and the whole upper side of his cranium just slid down the road. Since we were close to the train station an ambulance arrived almost immediately . They picked him up and thew him in the back of the ambulance. Some lady that was around picked up the upper part of the head , hovered around to collect whatever parts of the brain she could find and proceeded to gently place them in the back of the ambulance. I just stood there ... just watched.. and went home. Didnt tell my parents anything .. I was thinking it was some sort of a lucid dream or my imagination. I kept the memory intact. Some years later some people in front of my block of flats were talking about this very incident... thats when it hit me that I was not dreaming.",True,0,1512120448,,False,0,dqlof86,False,t3_7gkoc3,t3_7gkoc3,/r/AskReddit/comments/7gkoc3/what_is_the_most_fucked_up_thing_you_have_seen_in/dqlof86/,1514225857,3,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,

name_censored_,,,"&gt; What's up with the whole www3 thing in all their URLs?

(DNS+)HTTP-30x load balancing. In order;

 1. **DNS**: Your browser(/OS) hits the NS for ""hp.com"".
 2. **DNS**: The NSs for hp.com gets anycast to a (statelessly) rotated list of NS names. 
 3. **DNS**: The specific NS you hit then hands back a (rotating **single**) IP specific to your region.
 4. **HTTP:** The IPs on those servers *then* return an HTTP-301/HTTP-302 redirect to wwwX (www3/www5/etc).
 5. **HTTP:** The individual server(/DC) then handles your session dirties (cart status, etc).

\#1 (Global-NS -&gt; list-of-global-NSs) is necessary for stupidly obvious reasons. No-one hands out a single NS record (IIRC, this is an IANA requirement).

\#2 (Anycast-Global-NSs -&gt; Region-NS-IP's) is necessary to limit cross-region traffic. DNS is stupidly easy to anycast - it's stateless, so just advertise the IP from different regions and let BGP sort it out. If you don't care about initial site resolution time or cross-global synchronisation costs, you could let the next step ""guess"" the specific region. But traffic cost and UX aside, it's way more accurate to let the network decide who's nearest - rather than trying to guess based on the IP after-the-fact. This (is part of what) separates the little guys from the big guys.

\#3 (Region-NS -&gt; **single** IP) is necessary because Microsoft's DNS client always uses the numerically-lowest IP on A's (which generally means APAC - bad luck, EU and US). You can't just hand back a rotated/rotating list and expect it to work.

\#4 is done because those IPs cop *waaay* too much traffic for any individual server to serve anything more than a simple 30x redirect;

 * Procurement would crucify ops for the ten billionty dollars worth of CAPEX kit spend for each client-specific region and/or a *shit*-hot singly sited server/rack\* - (eg, French-Quebec is probably served from America's NYC-US rather than either France's RNS-FR or even Canada's YVR-CA), since the redirected will anyways be given the same information again. Let dev worry about writing distributed-system-friendly code.
 * Finance would immolate ops for the OPEX on the links to have a region-agnostic solution (let alone the latency).
 * Marketing/UX/Dev would bury ops for dropping session synchronisation (cart drops, navigation drops) on region change,
 * Ops would seppuku for delivering a single-point-of-failure (where SPOF = 1 server / rack / DC / state-province-country, depending on your scale) and/or a globally-diverse slew of POFs.

\#4 is really where your thing comes in. \#5 is so obvious it doesn't bear explaining.

A Philippines that banded together with their neighbouring Malays and resisted the European conquest. Imagine the deep native culture that could have been preserved and developed in all of those lost years until the present.

Indonesia and Vietnam have so much potential, and Malaysia/Thailand/Singapore have done very well economically. It's sad the Philippines is seen as a laggard, not a leader in the region. Really sad.

I think it was Nick Joaquin who had this argument about the ""contemporary advantages of Westernization"" for the Philippines. And that it's ok because our neighbors themselves chose to ignore or even ostracize us, allowing us to be taken over by Western powers.

TheHadramiguy,,Since 2011,"Click baity title 

&gt;Under a first, “zero migration” scenario, the Muslim population of Europe still would be expected to rise from the current level of 4.9 percent to 7.4 percent (roughly 36 million) by the year 2050 even “if all migration into Europe were to immediately and permanently stop.”

&gt;A second, “medium” migration scenario assumes that the flows of refugees stop, but “regular” migrants continue to come for reasons other than fleeing wars and instability. Under these conditions, Muslims could comprise 11.2 percent (59 million) of Europe’s population in 2050.

&gt;In a third, “high” migration scenario, the heavy influx of predominantly Muslim migrants recorded between 2014 and 2016 continues indefinitely. In this case, Muslims could make up 14 percent (75 million) of Europe’s population by 2050 – nearly triple the current figure.

2050 high migration

Sweden = 30,6 % 

France   = 18,0 %

the UK  = 17,2 %

Belgium = 18,2 %

Norway  = 17,0 %

This is somewhat depressing, but I still have hope because they counted everyone with a muslim background as muslim. Even though many statistics state that a quarter French Algerians(largest muslim demographic) don't identify with Islam and I assume that's the case for the rest of these countries.

Edit: I also doubt that Europe will experience another huge refugee crisis like they did in 2014-2016, so the third option will probably not happen, but it's still bad since Sweden will have approximately 20% muslim population if the second, “medium” migration scenario.",True,0,1512121674,,1512123489,0,dqlov6t,False,t3_7gtvgt,t3_7gtvgt,/r/exmuslim/comments/7gtvgt/muslim_population_in_europe_to_triple_by_2050/dqlov6t/,1514226122,6,False,exmuslim,t5_2s7k2,public,

People of lower economic class will most likely turn to crime to pay the bills.

But that's simply not true. At least it's an absurd oversimplification, because I already mentioned, eastern europe would be a cesspool of crime for the last 30 years. According to statistics and article published by Newsweek, 16 milion people out of ~38 milion in Poland alone lives in poverty. Out of these 16 milion, 2.5-4 milion is so poor they're hungry most of the time.

And that doesnt' make them commit crimes, at least not in amount that would suggest poor people likely commit crimes.

&gt;But when there is a low risk, then why shouldn't they turn to crime?

Because they're decent people, raised to understand that stealing something takes it away from someone else?

&gt;Here's the kicker though: more police is NOT the answer.

How is more patrols, meaning more captured criminals, not an answer to crime? 

&gt; Point is, by tackling these problems at the ROOT

Yeah, we can't suddenly make poor people not poor. 

&gt;So in order to help solve crime and reduce the amount of gang members and gang related violence, we must tackle the socioeconomic problems that surround these demographics that are more likely to commit crime.

Again, I absolutely disagree that just because people are poor, they commit more crimes. That's not how it works in vast majority of countries in Europe, and I would know, I lived in a country where 1/3 of the population was very poor because of communism. Sure, there were crimes, but absolutely not in that amount.

&gt;it is by providing people with the tools necessary for success.

&gt;This is not welfare, but it is increased funding for education, particularly in poor urban AND rural areas. It is also widening the applicability of student loans and easing the debt that students incur when pursuing higher education. It's by creating alternative paths of higher education

Today even a college degree doesn't mean you'll get a job. And up to high school education is free in the US, no? 

As for student loans, I still don't understand why US has paid higher education. That said, there's a fuckton of people who do just fine without a degree - at least in Europe. It can't be that much harder in the US.

&gt;they don't take into account the larger problems surrounding these issues.

They don't, because 'people are poor, so they commit crimes' doesn't compute with what's going on in european countries. Maybe in the US when people get poor, they suddenly flip a switch and go full crime mastermind mode, don't know - but in Europe, being poor doesn't automatically mean you'll go around jacking cars.

terminus-trantor,French,Portuguese Exploration,"&gt; How high did the sides of a caravel or carrack typically sit above the water?  

I will get back to you on this one later after consulting my sources. Hopefully they will have something more detailed. In general, the exact value would depend on the carrack itself and the cargo it holds. For now, the largest carracks were sometimes described as two or even three stories high.


&gt; Do you know how that would have compared to asian vessels

Asian vessels could be divided into two types: the smaller size rowed vessels, usually in large numbers which seem to be the usual ships for warfare and piracy; and the large cargo ""ships"" used for long range travel and trade  
For the initial carracks of first few decades of 1500s (of upto 400 tons) they were comparable to this large trade ships. We have Portuguese themselves noticing that during conquest of Malacca a South East Asian ship was taller than their largest carrack (Flor de la Mar, a 400 ton carrack). More about this instance you can read [in this AH thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/59080z/how_effective_were_javanese_ships/). By the end of century we have less comaprisons, but sources usually point out theat Portuguese carracks were the largest vessels around. 

Regarding combat, the larger ships were sometimes easily dispatched by anti-ship cannon fire (like apparently in battle of Diu 1509) and sometimes not (like the ship above from Malacca which seemed to be impervious to cannons of the period)

Smaller ships were very vulnarable to the fire from larger carracks (and caravels actually, who were also higher then those vessels) especially from the various swivel mounted breech loading guns (bercos, falcaos) which had high rate of fire, and while they couldn't harm large ships, were very effective against smaller boats and their exposed crew

&gt; other european vessels like the Mediterranean galley?

While the carrack was definitely higher in water then the galley and as such the galleys were unable to board them, the equpping of galleys with powerful bow cannons coupled with their superior maneuverability supposedly made galleys quite deadly for carracks, until the mid 16th century at least. At that point heavy broadside armament with watertight gun-ports that allowed cannons to be placed lower in the ship and finally be able to hit galleys started turning the odds. Guillmartin in his *Gunpowder &amp; Galleys: Changing Technology &amp; Mediterranean Warfare at Sea in the 16th Century* and *Galleons and Galleys* goes into this theory in more details. I personally have some reservations on it, and I suspect this effectiveness was more on a case to case basis

&gt;Also, do you happen to know how many personal arms were typically carried on portugese ships bound for east asia? for instance number of handguns, number of crossbows, number of suits of armor etc.?

Again when I can I will check my sources if maybe some additional details and earlier list exist, but for now the Outfitting of the Pepper Wreck article, citing a 1590 list of what *should be* armament for the 500-600 ton of 150ish crew, gives the following arms:

200 Spears   
50 Pikes  
100 Darts for the tops  
60 Harquebuses with all fittings  
1 quintal (58.75 kg) Gunpowder for handguns

Suits of armor aren't mentioned, other than how they were stored:

&gt; Helmets, cuirasses, and small weapons were stored on deck in barrels, sealed and protected as much as possible from moisture. Pikes, spontoons, or partisans were stored under the stern castle in boxes built to the purpose, near the boxes built for the muskets. Cannon balls were stored in wooden boxes on the main deck

To understand why they were so specifically focused on Serbia, there are a lot of factors involved. It was a matter of imperialistic foreign policy common of the time and the perceived value of expansion as a means of bolstering the nation as a whole, when it was in decline. Serbia was a prime target of this expansionism due to the already-hostile relations between the two over the recent Austrian annexation of Bosnia, and the Balkans in general were seen as Austria's ""for the taking"" with the Ottoman Empire practically disintegrating at the time, losing their influence over the region (hence the Austrian annexation of Bosnia).  

There also existed a certain primal hatred for Slavs among Germans. Wilhelm for example wrote; ""How hollow the whole Serbian power is proving itself to be; thus, it is seen to be with all the Slav nations! Just tread hard on the heels of that rabble!"". On receiving a diplomatic report in which a British diplomat had stated that any nation that accepted Austria's ultimatum would ""really cease to count as an independent nation"", Wilhelm further wrote ""That would be very desirable. Serbia is not a nation in the European sense, but a band of robbers!"". These sentiments were very common among both German and Austrian leadership.  

For Germany's part, beyond anti-slav sentiment they were not particularly concerned with Serbia's fate, but saw it merely as a means to an ends for a justified war against the other European powers.

I live in Finland and our government has just decided that people who are in our country illegally will have total access to health care and other social services. Us Finns have to pay for everything - first in taxes and then in service charges, but someone who has crossed our borders, has no papers whatsoever and no business to be in our country will get FREE: health care and medication, dental care, mental health services, access to schools if they are underage (i.e. they look under 40), legal assistance and of course ""crisis"" housing. They are not going to create separate services for these people either, they will be using our public services... though there have been cases of asylum seekers getting their teeth done at private dentist clinics. It came to light when the dentists complained that many asylum seekers do not arrive at their appointments. Private dentists are of course a lot more expensive than our public dentists, a lot of Finns wait in line for weeks or even months to get their teeth fixed, but at least they get to pay for the private dentist services asylum seekers receive.

It's been reported in our most mainstream news magazine that no one knows how many illegals are currently in our country and how many illegals will enter the country once they find out that we offer these perks.

One of the reasons why the aztec empire fell. Was that the conquistadors had help from other natives. It seems that sacrifasing other people makes it likely they will hate you more than outsiders. Also corn, tobacco, potatoes and tomatoes didn't exist in Europe before that. 

One of the things crusade did was the spread of trade across Mediterranean. As for ideas it brought chess into Europe. As for hurdrur foreign religion. The already knew it. You know how it occupied the cradle of cristandon. It was also for a lot of years already waging holy wars in west Turkey. 

The British and the Chinese.. ok there was pride on both sides as they bots seen themselves as rightful rulers of earth. But the opium wars were due to the British love of tea and the Chinese love of opium. Which was a new idea to them.  Also gunpowder.

&gt;**'Não tô nem acreditando', afirma Alan de Souza, de 15 anos, diante de gesto de solidariedade em Franca (SP). Adaptado para o aprendizado de braile, primeiro notebook tinha sido levado por ladrões antes de começar a ser usado.**  


&gt; O primeiro computador tinha sido comprado graças a uma ""vaquinha"" na última sexta-feira (24) durante a Black Friday, para ajudá-lo no aprendizado do braille, mas foi levado da casa do menino no sábado (25), enquanto ele e a família estavam em uma igreja. A história de Alan mobilizou os funcionários de uma rede varejista, que não só deram um computador de última geração como também presentearam o menino e a mãe com celulares novos. Ele ficou muito feliz, assim como nós estamos emocionados também"", conta o gerente de vendas e serviços financeiros Luciano Marques. A nova fase da vida levou Alan à descoberta de que poderia aprender braile e muitas outras coisas com a ajuda de um computador adaptado. Ao frequentar a escola especial, o garoto foi orientado pela professora sobre programas específicos que obedecem comandos por pessoas com deficiência visual. Isaura conta que, com a crise, ela e o marido ficaram desempregados e o pouco dinheiro que entra na casa é proveniente dos bicos feitos pelo companheiro. Segundo a mãe, a família, então, foi à igreja para celebrar o presente e deixou o computador em cima da mesa da cozinha, ligado na tomada para carregar a bateria.

Edit:

&gt;Alături de trei televizuni de știri și siteurile auxiliare, armate nevăzute de troli s-au încolonat într-o campanie uriașă de dezinformare. Tehnicile sunt vechi, desfășurate până acum în Rusia, Ungaria, Turcia sau Polonia, de regimuri aflate în derapaj democratic. Retorica lor, aceeași peste tot, se bazează pe o diversiune simplă: inventarea unor pericole inexistente asociate des cu instituțiile judiciare. Rezultă un delir cu alarme de tip „George Soros”, „stat paralel” în loc de separația puterilor în stat, invazii iminente de homosexuali, spioni și musulmani, corporații care ne cotropesc sau lozinci naționaliste gen „nu suntem o colonie”.

Os países europeus tem SIM a RESPONSABILIDADE de receber refugiados na convenção de 1951 os mesmos paises assinaram o compromisso de receberem REFUGIADOS ja que depois de duas grandes guerras e diversas crises econômicas eram os maiores exportadores de imigrantes, São Paulo chegou a ter 40% da sua população de italianos isso não levou ao fim apocalipcto que você alerta levou a mudança fator que a é natural das sociedades e mesmo esse suprasumo que era a população migrante italiana tambem foi rechaçada e violentada pelos paises hospedes.

That's conveying basic information to teammates, which is everyone's responsibility, at least in the context of team/pro (read: real) Overwatch. A coordinated team likely has designated viewports for maximum efficiency (e.g. Mercy watching flank routes, Rein watching main choke, Cree watching side doors, Torb guarding point. etc). In fact it's even more useful for ladder play because players so often don't know where they should be looking. Even calling target HP is not necessarily shot calling - it's likewise conveying information that not everyone has access to. On a side note, calling target health on a target either your whole team is looking at or only you can access is a waste of breath and comms clarity..

Shot calling is when you give brief outlines of a plan, or a timing for an engage, which direction the team focuses, who to target first in an engage, etc. It's the macro/strategy (as much as you can come up with in a temporary team of six), while what you're describing is the micro/tactics. Shot calling is understandably rare on the ladder (at least in my experience of EU), I imagine probably because it involves placing trust in a total stranger to know what they're talking about. Personally, I feel it's better to follow every shot caller without exception, just for the security of knowing the whole team is on the same page.

rmc,,,"“The Irish Republic’s EU commissioner has said Dublin will ‘play tough to the end’ over its threat to veto Brexit talks moving on to discuss trade,” was how the BBC reported Phil Hogan’s Observer interview at the weekend.
The problem is that Hogan, as the transcript of the interview shows, did not use either the word “threat” or “veto”, nor did he confirm that such a threat existed when asked.
Nor has the threat been made by the Government – Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has on at least two public occasions made clear that he has no intention of wielding the said veto.
Not only was it unnecessary, he said, but he disliked the use of the veto in EU decision-making as a matter of principle. Indeed, for many years Ireland has worked hard in the Council of Ministers to avoid using a veto, and even the word, acknowledging that it is a blunt instrument which may antagonise partners; better to join a consensus than thwart change even if that means occasionally taking a hit. Ireland gets marks for its clubability.
In the emerging area of European defence co-operation, an area requiring unanimity, Irish diplomats have skilfully incorporated language in EU texts that makes a nod in the direction of our neutrality – again without mentioning the word – while at the same time demonstrating a willingness not to impede the rest from moving forward with their common projects.
Big exception
The big exception is taxation where Dublin continues to insist the issue remains a national prerogative and will block harmonising legislation and any attempt, like that promised only on Tuesday by economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici, to move the issue to majority voting.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is pragmatic: “We don’t need to use a veto because we have complete solidarity on this issue with 26 other EU countries. It is clear to us that if there is not progress on the Irish Border, we will not be moving on to phase two [of Brexit negotiations] in December and that was reinforced to me ... by very senior EU leaders.”
The leaked report last week from Irish diplomats assessing the mood around Europe’s capitals reflected no partner issues with the current negotiating strategy, specifically the demand for movement on the Border in phase one. And Irish officials in Brussels say that there has been no dissent manifest at ambassadors’ meetings. The reported deal on the Brexit bill is unlikely to change that significantly.
But the “Irish veto threat” has become part of a new narrative from London – the Observer’s statement as fact that the threat has been made has been replicated not only by the BBC and Sky but in other newspapers such as the Financial Times and by British politicians.
Even RTÉ used “The Brexit Veto: How and why Ireland raised the stakes” to headline a perceptive online analysis by its Brussels man, Tony Connelly, though his only reference to such a threat was a denial that Ireland would be vetoing anything. Although the EU 27 might.
As tempers between Dublin and London have frayed over the insistence by Ireland and the EU negotiating task force that there has to be progress on the Border before phase two talks can begin, there has been what appears to be a concerted campaign by London to portray Dublin as the villain of the piece, ungrateful for all that the UK has done for us over the year, and aggressively upping the talks ante with little regard to the interests of fellow member-states’ interests. And dragging a perhaps reluctant Michel Barnier to places he would rather not go. The tail wagging the dog.
Talk of veto threats usefully develops this narrative – it suggests weakness, “Ireland alone” battling selfishly against the 26, but able to wield, the suggestion is, what is ultimately the undemocratic weapon of the veto. It is curious and ironic in this context, how wedded to the veto the UK has always been, seeing it as emblematic of the ultimate sovereignty of individual member states.
But no, we are not likely to be wielding a veto any time soon.",True,0,1512131376,,False,0,dqlsnpw,False,t3_7grm65,t3_7grm65,/r/ireland/comments/7grm65/irish_veto_threat_has_become_part_of_a_new/dqlsnpw/,1514228314,8,False,ireland,t5_2qhb9,public,

Car culture is definitely dying as to what it once was (although it may be more appearant in Europe). People used to actually like driving, people were tinkering on their cars on their drive ways. Cars were relatively slow, but they were fun to drive, engaging, most of them were manual, RWD (most of them anyway), and no one gave a shit about efficiency or mpg.

Nowadays there's nothing but 1L 3 cylinder turbo hybrids with as many features as possible to take driving away from the 'driver', automatic transmission, self driving features, big infotainment systems for maximum distraction from driving. This is what people are into now (in general). 

You can say that car culture is changing, but truth is, the majority of people doesn't enjoy driving (or cars) anymore. In fact, most people would prefer having manual driving entirely replaced with soulless robots so they can play with their phone without being distracted from traffic.

I can't be fucked responding point by point to your non existent responses except a couple of truly stupid things that actually bothered me.

""Slavery still goes on in many countries"" to which you responded i needed to get my facts straight.. well.. 

It does still happen. I know you want to think only evil american white males could possibly do anything wrong ever in the world but thats just not true, sex slave trade is huge in southeast asia, Child sex slaves, child soldiers in the congo,  Qatar has many indians with no passports, no rights, held against their will and forced to work for their owners. Hey guess what? That's called slavery.


Yeah so actually, the worst example ever of racism against a group of people is very easily the holocaust, which consisted of mostly white europeans. 6 million where killed during that, systematically (i do know how cuckold's love that word, so it was quite fun to throw it in there.)

So the OP didn't quite have the right timeline down, but compared to your argument, he's solid gold.


I know your next argument too, that the holocaust had nothing to do with skin color, That's not racism, racism attacks people based on their RACIAL IDENTITY, which is a LARGER component than just their skin tone. So don't even bother with that flacid ""wouldn't satisfy anyone"" argument.

It's interesting to think about some common features in Slavic and Latin grammar: the first declension comprises words ending in ""-a"" and they're mostly feminine, except some explicitly masculine terms like nauta ""sailor"", agricola ""peasant"" in Latin and papa ""dad"", starosta ""~boss"", yunosha ""adolescent (boy)"" ― in Russian. Second declension has words of masculine and neuter genders, ending in ""us"" and ""um"", respectively ― in Latin and ending in a consonant and ""o/e"" in Russian, respectively. Third declension in Latin looks somewhat similar to those several words in Russian that are considered exceptions, not in any of the three declensions, ending in ""я"" which emerged from nasal ""ię"", of neuter gender, ending in ""eni"" in all oblique cases ― compare Russian semę, semeni to Latin semen, seminis. And the fifth declension in Latin, as the third in Russian, has a few feminine words with the least number of different endings.

ChinggisHan,,,"Right yeah thats the understanding I had before. The thing is, our y chromosome dna came from one area and our mtdna came from a different area. So if im understanding you, the original population from which the kyrgyz came from, had both caucasian ydna and the mt asian dna, and that small group split from them, with that group being mostly caucasian ydna men who also had asian mt dna. 

The thing I dont get is, when did that mix happen? 

For example, a lot of hispanic men have european ydna and native american mtdna because the spaniards had genocided native americans and taken native american wives or raped them. 

We have a similar situation in the kyrgyz in that our caucasian ydna far outmatches our asian ydna while our asian mt dna far outmatches our caucasian mt dna. 

The one thing i seem to have concluded from this though, and correct me if im wrong, we're not descendants of genghis khan and mongol warriors then? Because the ones who apparently can claim that are the Kazakhs

Le mec dit clairement qu'il est pour la désintégration de la souveraineté française au nom du fédéralisme européen, il soutient des propos insultants sur tous ceux qui pensent différemment. Le tout en notant tout de même que ça pose un problème de démocratie. 



&gt;Tu t'efforces de faire apparaître un pseudo bon peuple français de souche qui serait méprisé et maltraité par les élus vendus aux minorités, et ça c'est de la victimisation.

Non, je note que ce mec est un adversaire des français de souche et qu'il méprise ceux qui ne pensent pas comme lui sur la nation et la souveraineté et finalement la démocratie. 



&gt; Les français de souche, c'est un faux concept, et  la définition que tu en as donné est arbitraire et idiote. Des grands-parents enterrés en France ? 

C'est ma définition, d'autres te citeront la phrase du général de Gaulle : ""nous sommes quand même avant tout un peuple européen de race blanche, de culture grecque et latine, et de religion chrétienne"". Je pense que ça ne fait pas assez ressortir les racines et la souche, d'où ma référence aux grands parents. On peut également très bien parler de quartiers de francité, ça m'est égal. C'est l'idée qu'il y a derrière qui compte. 

&gt;Ca ferait des français de souche des gens entrés sur le territoire avant hier, au nom du regroupement familial. 

Le regroupement familial est une sottise et tu as oublié ma définition précédente de la nationalité française. Il faut suivre un peu mieux. J'avais déjà précédemment dit que la nationalité française, c'est être né en France, y avoir grandi, se sentir français et être reconnu comme tel par ses pairs. 

Bref tu es complètement à côté de la plaque avec ton interprétation inutilement agressive (complexe d'infériorité ?). 


&gt; Les minorités sont, par définition, moins nombreuses. Le politique qui les courtiserait au détriment d'une majorité ne serait jamais élu.

Pff. Déjà c'est mathématiquement faux. Une majorité à 40% et deux minorités à 30% par exemple. 

Fallait réfléchir avant d'écrire. 

&gt;Or, Taché et le parti auquel il appartient ont été portés au pouvoir par une large majorité, qui partage l'essentiel de ses idées. 


Looool. Tu as oublié deux choses : premièrement l'abstention (touchant principalement les catégories populaires et les jeunes- ceux qui votent le plus FN) qui fait que Macron a non seulement été élu par une minorité de Français, mais même par une minorité du corps électoral, deuxièmement que les votes ne valent pas adhésion au programme, sinon il aurait eu la majorité dès le premier tour.

BiftekVisage,,,"Left 3 years ago to move to Asia.

I left primarily because i was (and still am) bored of Sydney (Australia as well, arguably)- I understand this is subjective, but i really have had enough of the place for at least another 5 - 10 years. 

Other factors for the move were - my wife felt exactly the same way, cost of housing in Sydney, extortionate cost of living in Sydney (food, utilities and beer costs are absurd), and just general boredom with life in Australia. Contrary to many people, i wasn't totally dissatisfied with my career however prospects for further growth were becoming limited, and my opportunity to buy a house in a place i actually wanted to live evaporated before my eyes.

Where i live now -  cost of living is lower, people are friendlier (in general, just more civil to each other than in Sydney. Society is much more communal and cooperative, even in the middle of the busiest cities), quality of life is great - all the 'western' trappings are here if you really want them. Food is fantastic. Everyday life is MUCH less regulated. The country itself is so much more interesting and complex than Australia - there are 54 officially recognised ethinc groups here, all with their own languages and customs. Include the informally recognised groups and it's more like 100. The landscapes are more diverse and interesting than Australia - steaming hot palm lined beaches all the way to huge european-esque mountains covered in pine trees and fog + everything in between. Australia for all it's beauty as well, can be monotonous. 
And i'm also just a couple of hours away from new holiday adventures in many other countries too. 

Life is much richer now. I wake up each day feeling excited and optimistic however in my final year in Sydney i was drowning in pessimism and was feeling very uninspired. Plus, most beer here is about $1.25 AUD a glass!

Things I miss the most? Family &amp; friends (although with social media and skype it feels like i never left - and they do visit occasionally), certain western foods that are hard to come by, Australia's beaches are still beyond compare as well.

&gt;**Maioria das siglas governistas vê um cenário ainda incerto e evita se comprometer com nomes colocados como possíveis candidatos em 2018**  


&gt; BRASÍLIA - Embora o Planalto defenda uma candidatura única à Presidência em 2018, a maioria das siglas da base aliada vê um cenário ainda incerto e evita se comprometer com nomes colocados como possíveis candidatos. Em entrevista nesta quarta-feira, 29, o ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, afirmou que a ideia é construir uma candidatura única entre os partidos da atual base de sustentação do governo Temer para “representar esse legado”. Como mostrou o Estado no sábado, 25, o presidente Michel Temer articula a construção de uma ampla frente de centro-direita para ajudar na aprovação de pautas econômicas, principalmente da reforma da Previdência, e mantê-la unida até a disputa eleitoral de 2018. “Tudo vai depender de como a economia estará, como o ‘Fora, Temer’ ficará no próximo ano”, disse o presidente nacional do DEM, senador Agripino Maia (RN). Ele diz que, atualmente, a sigla tem “pouca chance” de apoiar Lula, embora o presidente da legenda, senador Ciro Nogueira (PI), tenha declarado voto no ex-presidente. A prioridade do presidente licenciado da legenda, o ministro Gilberto Kassab (Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações), é se eleger em uma chapa majoritária em São Paulo ao lado do senador José Serra (PSDB). O presidente nacional do PMDB, senador Romero Jucá (RR), avalia que Alckmin e Meirelles são dois nomes viáveis para serem o candidato do centro.

He also demands a re-run of the election, despite the [government leaflet] (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160813202542/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk) sent to every household in the country, and paid for by the taxpayer, saying the following:

- ""This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide."" (Apparently a lie, according to Westmacott in this article. He then has the  balls to accuse the Leave campaign of dishonesty)

P.S. a few other lies and distortions in that leaflet

- ""Britain has kept its own border controls inside the EU"" (clearly untrue)
- ""the UK will not be part of further European political integration"" (probably untrue had we voted Remain. The EU's motto is Ever Closer Union.)
- ""The EU’s single market has over 500 million customers 5 and an economy over 5 times bigger than the UK’s."" (misleading, because it includes the UK itself e.g. 4 men aren't ""five times"" bigger than me because I happen to be standing with them)
- Voting to leave the EU would ""cost jobs"" (employment has kept on rising ever since)
- ""The government judges it could result in 10 years or more of uncertainty"" (apparently a wrong estimate, given the leaving date is now fixed, with a max 2 year transition)
- less than 8% of EU exports come to the UK while 44% of UK exports go to the EU. (totally misleading, because in numerical rather than % terms the situation is reversed Edit: ie Britain imports more than it exports to/from the EU. % terms don't matter, because Britain does very little trade with EU countries like Bulgaria)
- ""EU membership means you and your family have the right to live, work or study abroad in any of the 27 other member countries."" (wrong, unless you speak about 20 foreign languages at business level)
- ""The UK is a strong, independent nation."" (we now know that 12,000 of our laws have been written in Brussels and Strasbourg)

littlephatty123,,,"Det är väldigt svårt att hjälpa på plats i krigszoner. Det är inte ju inte svält, avsaknad av skolor och fattigdom som är problemet (där kan man hjälpa på plats), utan det är förföljning, terrorism, bomber och krig som är det. 
Varför tror du att oskyldiga civila muslimer inte tar hand om varandra? Det är ju regimen och IS som inte gör det, och dem ska vi inte hjälpa.

Jag vill inte vara sån nu, men jag vill gärna vet vart du har läst att en majoritet av 1.6 miljarder muslimer vill ha dödstraff för homosexuella.

Vi har djurskyddslagar i Sverige som bestämmer att djuret inte får slaktas utan bedövning. Halalslakten som sker här är godkänd, och djuret lider inte mer än en normal slakt. Utanför EU så kan det absolut anses vara tortyr, men det kan vanlig slakt också vara.

Håller med om att kvinnorättigheterna är väldigt begränsade i många muslimska länder, och att många flyktingar är konservativare än oss på den punkten. Som sagt, de är vanliga människor, med annorlunda åsikter på vissa punkter. Vissa kommer lära sig och ändra sig när de ser hur kvinnor har det här, vissa inte.
Om vi verkligen ska agera åsiktspoliser, och är villiga att neka flyktingar i nöd pga hur konservativa de är,
då borde vi väl slänga ut/fänglsla våra egna nazister först.

Jag tycker inte att det du tycker är kontroversiellt, jag vet att många håller med dig. Tror heller inte det finns några rasistiska motiv bakom det.
Förstår definitivt att det kan vara svårt att se landet man växte upp i kan förändras så fort.

Racism and white supremacy is not new.   Facism, militarism, and authoritarianism are not new. Corruption and crony capitalism ar not new.  Sexism and support of sexual predators is not new.  Fossil fuel interests dictating policy is not new.  Exploitation of Native Americans to gain resource wealth is not new.  Police violence against minority groups is not new.

We are dealing with the current political environment, and it feels so incredibly foreign, *because* we have made so much progress on these issues. Even as soon as 10-15 years ago, the political consensus for things like immigration rights, patriarchy and harrassment in the workplace, white supremacy in culture,  or dismissal of environmental issues like climate change were all far more dominant than they are now.  

We killed the tobacco industry's control of our politics.  We stopped industry from polluting our waters and air.  Our grandparents and those before us literally fought and died in the streets to have fair wages and safe working conditions.  We ended slavery and Jim Crow.  We defeated facism in Europe.  We've accomplished difficult and painful things as a nation and we will continue to do so.

wokeupabug,pro,history of philosophy,"&gt; analytic philosophy is premised on the Lockean idea of the philosopher as the 'underlabourer' to the natural scientist and the logical-positivist view that the purpose of philosophy is the clarification of logical thought

This seems to me a rather narrow view of analytic philosophy. Even in ""classical"" analytic philosophy, the tradition was dominated by a reaction *against* ""the logical-positivist view that the purpose of philosophy is the clarification of logical thought"" by the 1950s.

And even this characterization of the logical positivist view it self, even though it might be acceptable to those who aren't specialists in this period, rather vulgarizes the movement by omitting the political, metaphysical, and metaphilosophical background for the emphasis on logic (and the substantive works of logical positivism developing these themes!). One finds among logical positivists, most notably in Schlick and Neurath, very much an engagement ""within the broad tradition of Western humanism""--Schlick wrote on ethics, aesthetics, and the meaning of life; Neurath wrote on ethics, politics, and culture. And the logical positivists in general explicitly situated their work, in the traditional humanist manner, within a distinct culture movement that included innovations in the arts (especially associated with ""New Objectivity"") and politics (on which they were split, between the bourgeois liberalism associated with Schlick and the scientific socialism associated with Neurath).

While I think logical positivism lost much of this systematic and humanistic impulse when it left Europe for America, I don't think we can then say that American philosophy is dominated by the kind of model you describe here. Classic works in later analytic philosophy include, for instance, works on political philosophy, that don't at all fit the model of philosophy as merely foundation of the natural science and clarification of logic.",True,0,1512138840,,False,0,dqlxl63,False,t3_7gsywg,t1_dqlnn8l,/r/askphilosophy/comments/7gsywg/bridging_analytic_and_continental_philosophy/dqlxl63/,1514231102,4,False,askphilosophy,t5_2sc5r,public,

HALsaysSorry,,,"“Blighty"" is a British English slang term for Britain or often specifically England.

Examples: 
‘Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty"" - a music hall song written in 1916. It was popular during the First World War and tells a story of three fictional soldiers on the Western Front suffering from homesickness and their longing to return to ""Blighty"". 

Also commonly used: ‘blighty wound’ - a wound that would cause an English soldier to be sent home from service abroad

Blighter - also British slang, but different origin, comes from ‘blight’ + er.  Use this word to describe ‘a contemptible, worthless man; a scoundrel or rascal.’

Or use it more neutrally to simplify describe ‘a chap; a bloke’ as in : “the poor blighter thought he’d copped a blighty, but he was treated and ordered back to the Front’.
Simple, no?

*Originated in India in the 1800s to mean an English or British or ‘visitor’, it was first used during the South African Boer War in the specific meaning of the English homeland, during World War I the term became widespread.

According to recent editions of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word derives from ""bilayati"", a regional variant of the Hindi word ""vilayati"", meaning ""foreign"", ""British"", ""English"" or ""European.""",True,0,1512138872,,False,0,dqlxm6n,True,t3_7gp0y8,t3_7gp0y8,/r/wwi/comments/7gp0y8/november_30_1917_roast_meat_potatoes_onions/dqlxm6n/,1514231117,1,False,wwi,t5_2u3bf,public,

Saeleth,HAMB,Moin Moin Digga,"&gt;**Das sagen Verbraucherschützer**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Diesen Ausbau in ländlichen Gebieten leisten in Deutschland die Netzbetreiber, während in anderen EU-Ländern wie Großbritannien der Staat den Ausbau fördert. Deutsche Anbieter sind dagegen verpflichtet, den Ausbau selbst in die Hand zu nehmen und auch ländliche Gebiete mitzuversorgen. Dadurch kämen dann auch höhere Preise zustande.
Dass die höheren Preise in Deutschland durchaus mit einer gewissen Berechtigung zustande kommen, bestätigt auch der Verbraucherschützer Christian Gollner von der Verbraucherzentrale Rheinland-Pfalz. Gegenüber FOCUS Online erklärt er: „Auch im Mobilfunk richten sich die Preise grundsätzlich nach Angebot und Nachfrage. Aus unserer Sicht lassen sich die Preise für mobiles Breitband international aber nicht so einfach vergleichen wie zum Beispiel der Preis für einen Big Mac. 4G ist nicht immer gleich 4G. Ausbau und Betrieb von LTE-Netzen sind kostspielig. In Deutschland kommt dazu, dass große Landstriche abzudecken sind. Im Rahmen der letzten Versteigerung von Übertragungsfrequenzen hatte die Bundesnetzagentur den Anbietern die Pflicht auferlegt, deutschlandweit 98 Prozent der Haushalte mit mobilem Breitband zu versorgen. Dies ist für die Anbieter mit zusätzlichen Kosten verbunden.“
Neben den deutschen Besonderheiten, wie der Verpflichtung zur Versorgung der ländlichen Gebiete und technischen Unterschieden, nennt Gollner jedoch noch einen weiteren Grund, den die Netzbetreiber naturgemäß weniger gerne ansprechen: der fehlende Wettbewerb. Gollner: „Mit der Übernahme von E-Plus durch Telefónica hat sich das Oligopol in unserem Land noch weiter verschärft. Einen aggressiven Preiswettbewerb, gerade bei mobilem Breitband, können wir unter den drei Mobilfunknetzbetreibern derzeit leider nicht erkennen.“

pinaygirl,blue,abroad,"It's not that simple.  Republicans are more business friendly and therefore, are seen to put more money in your pocket during their administration.  For instance, Reagan was a beloved Republican president and is highly regarded for improving life in the US (and globally) during his time.   If you want to pay less tax, then you vote Republican.  Democrats OTOH will usually mean higher taxes to cover more social programs, whether or not you agree with or support those programs.

That said, Democrats are more socially progressive by nature, and definitely skew more like how ""conservative"" Europe tends to operate (minus the extreme alt right parties they have there).  Believe it or not, the Philippine government in general (ALL PARTIES, including liberal ones) are much more like the Republican party in the US.  If you want a mapping of regional politics from most conservative to most liberal, it goes like this:  Philippine parties &gt; US GOP &gt; US Dems &gt; European Conservatives &gt; European Liberals.  

The term ""liberal"" and ""conservative"", when applied to different countries, continents or regions may actually mean different things and may have different flavors from what you may be familiar with.

Here's a badling thread from one of the threads that hit /r/all that day.

https://np.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/6wxumm/rcringeanarchy_encounters_pidgin_bad_linguistics/ 

Edit: A search for ""BBC Pidgin"" also yields A TON of badling threads. I found this comment (again on cringeanarchy):

&gt; The catch with Pigdin English is that nobody actually speaks it. It's an intentionally simplified and easy to learn variant of English used soley by non-native speakers to communicate with English speakers and others who don't speak their primary language.

&gt; There's just so many primary languages in Sub-Saharan Africa that it's basically impossible for the BBC to do all the translations into all the dialects, but a good number of people can sort of speak/read this.

&gt;If it becomes a primary language, it changes classification to a ""creole,"" but a pidgin is very specifically not a primary language people actually use regularly.

""Nobody actually speaks it"" is an understatement if I ever heard one. Some official languages of the EU have fewer speakers than WAP (Like Maltese). And nobody stomps on the smaller european languages for having few speakers. 

""Intentionally simplified"" also implies that pidgins and creoles are constructed languages, which simply isn't true. 

I'm also not sure what to make of the ""primary"" language argument. A lot of people speak WAP and WAP has very little in terms of literature, while the other languages in the area probably have a lot more written resources (I'm sorry I have to make assumptions this big). If I were a native WAP speaker, I'd probably be happy someone recognizes my language by publishing in it.

Drzhivago138,,2002 Mazda Tribute ES V6,"Lemme try this again without blacklisted links:

A sedan can have either four doors or two doors, but has the same roofline either way. Historically, the 2-door sedan was often reserved for the most basic model of car: Here's a ['67 Fairlane 2-door sedan](https://hobbydb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/processed_uploads/catalog_item_photo/catalog_item_photo/image/276817/1967_FORD_Fairlane_2_Door_Cars_273e9c7a-cbaa-400d-aa76-0c2e61d08eb2.jpg) vs. the ['67 4-door sedan](http://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/198435/198435_Side_Profile_Web.jpg). Just as 4-door sedans shared many parts with 4-door wagons, so too were 2-door sedans used as the basis for 2-door wagons: [Falcon 2-door sedan](https://d3dxp4akn1otfb.cloudfront.net/1964-Ford-Falcon-american-classics--Car-100878165-b7de692219f04465275db7211558df31.jpg?r=fit&amp;w=430&amp;s=1) vs. [Falcon 2-door wagon](http://car-from-uk.com/ebay/carphotos/full/ebay708006.jpg).

In the years before seatbelts and child locks, 2-door sedans and wagons were often considered suitable family cars, as they had the same interior room as 4-doors, but allowed the parents to ""lock"" their brood in the rear seat without worrying about them inadvertently opening the doors and tumbling out onto the turnpike.

A coupe is different from a 2-door sedan in that it has something cut down: the word ""coupe"" comes from the French *couper,* meaning ""to cut."" This can either refer to the roofline being cut down, the wheelbase being shortened, or both. This ['67 Fairlane](https://cdn2.mecum.com/auctions/fl0115/fl0115-204277/images/fl0115-204277_2.jpg?1422115263000) has the same 116"" WB as the 2- or 4-door sedan, but its hardtop roofline is sloped more in the back. The 1968-77 GM A-bodies used a 112"" WB for coupes and a 116"" WB for sedans.

Coupes can have a B-pillar or not (pillarless hardtop), though this sometimes affects their desirability. In the late '60s/early '70s, GM referred to their lowest-priced 2-door A-body models as [""2-door sedans,""](http://lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/70buick/bilder/26.jpg) but since they rode on a 112"" WB vs. the sedan's 116"", they are technically just coupes with a B-pillar.

2-door sedans *always* have a B-pillar, so they are sometimes referred to as ""2-door posts"" to differentiate from the pillarless hardtop style also popular in the late '60s. Even though flashy hardtops were heavily promoted during the muscle car era, ""2-door posts"" were often more desirable than pillarless hardtops to street racers, for two reasons: one, they were usually base model cars, so they were cheaper; and two, the B-pillar gave better structural rigidity to the body. In the years since, pillarless hardtops got more popular due to their image, while 2-door posts were unceremoniously junked on the enduro circuit. Now, we're seeing something of a turnaround, as 2-door sedans are once again desirable due to their rarity.

2-door sedans largely died out in the early '70s among American cars, but they continued on smaller Japanese and European models well into the early '80s ([like this '81 Corolla 2-door sedan](http://topclassiccarsforsale.com/uploads/photoalbum/1981-toyota-corolla-sedan-2-door-coupe-3.jpg)), before also fizzling out in those models as well as they moved further upmarket.

Right, after 25 years of US imperialism and a forced, U.S.-led, coupe. And it's also still not a reason to support a genocidal maniac who uses chemical weapons.

&gt; Bygones. Blaming people for what their parents did is stupid.

But it isn't a bygone. That event was only the beginning. So ww2 didn't matter either? Because they are all dead now. The korean war has no effect on present day? Those are all dead now. This is bullshit logic and you know it.

&gt; It shouldn’t be the basis for enmity. It is because North Korea is evil, but it shouldn’t be

Well same here, U.S. enforcing things like sanctions will not make the relationships better.

Shebaa farms still occupied. Why should Hezbollah disarm with an aggresive colonial neighbour?

&gt; Not if the international community has anything to say about it.

The international community isn't the U.S.A and Israel.

&gt; “Their parents hurt my parents” is bullshit justification.

Well maybe if it was only ""their parents"" we could argue about it, but since its been a consecutive list of events of ""we hurt them"" this doesn't apply.

I oppose nukes and I oppose hypocrisy. Even if U.S.A. is one of the most powerful countries, their moral standards are shit and therefore don't get to earn the call to make these kind of decisions.

capriciousuniverse,,,"There has been a huge propaganda against Erdogan radiating from Europe and the US. And this why every election time people like most people on reddit hope that Erdogan loses but he's been winning for 16 years  in a country where 85% of the population turn out to vote.

  As a Turkish American who follows media from both side, I can say that western media has not been fair to both Erdogan and Turkey. I have not read a single positive article in Turkey in a long time. I don't see the western media talk how Turkey's been growing faster than any other European country. I don't see anything about that. Turkey's operation in Syria killed more than 1500+ ISIS fighters. Turkey never got the credit it deserved. United States kept arming YPG/PYD and Turkey sent many proofs that the guns sent to them was being used against Turkey and killed turkish soldiers. The US still arms terrorist organizations in the area rather than supporting its NATO ally. Turkey hosts more than 3 million refugees but you don't read about that. People earn more, the minimum wage has gone up more than 10%. Don't read about that. AKP has built infrastructure more than any other government combined. Don't read about that. 

   One of the and I think the main reason why there is a huge propaganda against Erdogan is because Turkey's defense system. Erdogan has refused to buy defense equipment from other countries way long ago and invested so much money on Turkish made defense equipment. He also doesn't get lectured by the US or the Europe and does what he believes is the best for the country. And this is why he keeps being elected.

   I can list many more reasons why you guys keep getting Turkey wrong. And you will, again, get it wrong in  2019 elections. I see many people saying that how you guys feel bad for turkish people because they don't get to read and know the truth. Yeah they do. And believe me they feel bad for you guys and how the west has been brainwashed by the media that's controlled by people who don't want to see fully independent, powerful Turkey in the most complicated region of the world.

StrixTechnica,,,"&gt; A border will go up because the EU is bound by the WTO non-discrimination principle to put it up

Can you cite the WTO GATT article where that is stipulated?

So far as I know, the WTO GATT only deals with what tariffs countries *may* impose (tariff bounds), not what they *must* (applied tariffs, and it turns out, or seems to, that a country can unilaterally lower or abolish altogether a tariff if they so choose).  It does not specify how those tariffs are collected.  It doesn't even impose particularly strong limitations on NTBs, which is why MRAs are such a big deal.

&gt; It's just basic WTO law.

The WTO GATT is a treaty, it's not law.  It's *mediated* by the international equivalent of contract law, but WTO members have no recourse, in a legal sense, beyond the provisions of the GATT and to the extent that signatories submit to the WTO DSB (as they are treaty-bound to do).

&gt; Blaming the EU for it is pointless and factually wrong.

I await with interest to see evidence of this.

&gt; The fact is that if the Gov insists on leaving the EEA, there is going to be a very difficult border.

Only if politicians want it that way.  Even if the GATT did stipulate hard borders, the WTO could only intervene in failure to build one by both sides if one or the other brought a case before the WTO, which would seem unlikely if both sides had signalled their mutually-shared disinclination to build a hard border in the first place.

And before you suggest a third party might intervene, you'd have to establish what standards of 'standing' the equivalent of WTO jurisprudence has (since, again, WTO is not law).  The EU *might* have standing and might go over the heads of IE and complain about its customs border, which would pose an interesting technical dilemma for the WTO:

Although the EU writes customs regulations and despite being a member of the WTO in its own right, the EU itself is not a sovereign state where IE *is*, and EU regulations and directives pass into member state regulation and law via the TEU so, technically, it's the member state exercising its sovereign power prompted by the EU (ie, by agreement), rather than the EU acting directly on its own authority — and so a complaint by the EU on behalf of IE in direct contravention of IE's wishes regarding **IE's** sovereign border might find itself relegated in deference to IE's sovereignty.

That would be one for WTO lawyers to argue before a DSB.

&gt; Border Inspection Posts being only one example. That's the UK Gov's fault, not the EU.

Time you and other antibrexiters started to act like adults and own your own shit.  Yes, the UK formally instigated the issue by invoking Art. 50, but the EU is responsible for setting up the environment which gave the British public cause to prompt the UK government to invoke Art. 50 (very much against its preferences, it must be said) in the first place.

The EU cannot avoid its responsibility in this shambles, particularly when the EU had it within its power to come to a workable solution during the Art. 50 process.  You cannot rely on EU rules as an excuse for not taking responsibility for any of this, because they are the *EU's* rules and they are at liberty to vary them within the limits of the TEU — and they have very great latitude to do so.

So stop blaming the UK entirely and own up to your own part in this.

&gt; Once again, they are just enforcing the international law that they are obliged to enforce.

And once again, the WTO is not international law.  It is mediated by *jus gentium*, but there's absolutely nothing in international law that requires anything like a hard border.  That is, so far as I know, fundamentally and as far as *jus gentium* goes, a sovereign prerogative of the sovereign states who share the border.",True,0,1512142561,,1512142747,0,dqm11zl,False,t3_7gl9ml,t1_dqltoqv,/r/brexit/comments/7gl9ml/brexit_northern_ireland_may_stay_in_single_market/dqm11zl/,1514232974,1,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,public,

kdoubledogg,,,"Again, I am pushing you to show me the data backing up your claims. You make very ambitious claims that may or may not be true, but you do not back them up with anything.

1. You say that the collapse of Libya will give the ""downtrodden and poor"" something you describe as ""vicious revenge fantas[ies]."" While Libyan refugees could certainly pose a threat, even though Libya has collapsed around 2011, the last major terrorist attack by Libyan terrorists with the [1988 Pan Am 103 bombing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/a-history-of-terrorism-in-europe/). [The Manchester bomber was of Libyan descent, but was born in the U.K. his family along with many other radicalized Libyan Islamists actually *cheered* the collapse of the Qaddafi regime](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/salman-abedi-manchester-arena-bomber-radicalisation). This does not mitigate the risk of terrorists exploiting refugee routes, but does seem to complicate the narrative of a ""core of angry Libyan refugees out for blood."" As a very balanced report by the Danish Institute for International Studies reports, ""[In the period between January 2016 and April 2017, four asylum-seekers were involved in terrorist incidents, but no actual refugees.](https://www.diis.dk/en/research/european-citizens-not-refugees-behind-most-terrorist-attacks-in-europe)"" The report also acknowledges the shortcomings of European migration control, most notably in the Paris and Brussels attacks where terrorists exploited the soft border controls coming from Syria (not Libya) and says that greater interstate border controls, as well as tighter restrictions on the perimeter of the Schengen Area are needed, but that it should not completely restrict the flow of persons nor impede the European refugee effort.

1. While the Paris and Brussels attacks exposed weaknesses in Europe's border and intelligence agencies, I do not see any indication that they have not tried to rectify the problem. And the problem of returning ISIS fighters, while worrying, still remains less worrisome than homegrown terrorism. :

&gt; [As for the attackers in France and Belgium, “that cell is largely gone, but there are still pieces to be found,” Manuel Navarrete, chief of the European Counterterrorism Center, said in an interview here at the headquarters of Europol, an intelligence-sharing arm of the European Union.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/fewer-isis-fighters-returning-home.html)

&gt; [European intelligence services, along with Interpol, have created major new databases of suspected foreign fighters; European spy agencies and Europol have also created counterterrorism hubs in the Netherlands for sharing information and mapping out strategy.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/fewer-isis-fighters-returning-home.html)

&gt; [And a classified American military program in Jordan called Operation Gallant Phoenix is scooping up data collected in commando raids in Syria and Iraq and funneling it to law enforcement agencies in Europe and Southeast Asia. “That’s our intelligence- and information-sharing architecture,” Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in describing the program to Congress in June.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/politics/fewer-isis-fighters-returning-home.html) 

1. You are correct to point out that Poland has had zero terrorist attacks and the answer to why is relatively obvious: they have a small Muslim population that has not become radicalized. I do think that people are naïve to look beyond Islam as a potential starting point for radicalization and terrorism; In comparison to other religions (besides maybe radical Buddhism), Islam stands alone. What this does not tell us is how to react to the current refugee crisis and whether that means all refugees should be refused entry into Europe. And a sudden collapse of the EU due to one Polish terrorist attack could theoretically happen, but seems unlikely.

1. If Poland were to continue to press for stricter border controls, then they may find themselves in a difficult position, [because they continue to have the highest number of emigres living across the EU](http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/origins-destinations-of-european-union-migrants-within-the-eu/) and there legal status could come into question if Poland continues to flaunt EU freedom of movement. There also is the point that Poland is essentially protesting a moot point. [Many Syrian refugees that have been settled in the Baltics, have left for more attractive Western European countries almost as soon as they are settled](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40479224) and the same thing would likely happen in the Visegrád Group.

1. Finally, the borders have been effectively shut for over a decade now (except in the case of Visegrád migrants traveling to other EU countries) and as I mentioned before, the rechristianization has yet to show any signs of genesis. I do agree that these countries will increasingly use religiosity as a *rhetorical device* (though it would sound absurd coming from the Czech Republic) but not necessarily a truly spiritual revival.

The EU is flawed, especially from a Catholic perspective. Accepting refugees from Muslim-majority countries also poses a certain risk. But there is no need to engage in fact-free postulating on the subject, as tempting as it is.

&gt; Monti, also a former EU Commissioner and now a senator, was giving the keynote speech at the Foreign Press Association Media Awards where he suggested that the UK should be forced to leave one of its best products behind.

&gt;“The European Union, when the UK leaves, should take the decision of upgrading the use of the English language in European Union affairs,” he said at the dinner at the Sheraton Grand last night. The EU has always conducted itself in two languages at  its core, French and English, with the additional 22 languages used as required. However now the UK is leaving, English’s automatic status isn’t a given. 

&gt; Monti thought it should not just be used, but made the official tongue: “I think we should upgrade the ways we use English and it should become the language of the European Union.

bacta,,,"Nou inderdaad! Baudet benadrukt: ""Meer Europese slaven in Noord-Afrika dan zwarte slaven in de VS"" met een link naar het NRC-artikel dat deze uitspraak als waar beoordeelt (een foute beoordeling, zo blijkt). Ondertussen wordt de verdere inhoud van het NRC-artikel door Baudet en aanhang blijkbaar genegeerd:  
&gt; Uit de cijfers blijkt dat tussen 1500 en 1900 ruim 12,3 miljoen Afrikaanse slaven getransporteerd werden naar ‘de Amerika’s’, en dat van hen ruim 10,5 miljoen de overtocht haalden. De meeste slaven kwamen terecht in Brazilië (bijna 4,9 miljoen), de Britse Caraïben (2,3 miljoen), de Spaanse koloniën in Zuid-Amerika (bijna 1,3 miljoen) en de Franse Caraïben (1,1 miljoen). ‘Slechts’ 389.000 slaven gingen naar Noord-Amerika.

Tegenover ""1 miljoen tot mogelijk 1,25 miljoen blanke slaven"" in Noord-Afrika. Maar de zwarte slaven buiten de Verenigde Staten zijn even niet belangrijk dus..

En het artikel dat OP heeft gedeeld wijst er dus op dat het aantal voor Noord-Afrika gaat over het totaal aantal blanken dat daar in slavernij heeft geleefd. De aantallen van zwarte slaven gaan alleen over *getransporteerden*, en rekent niet de miljoenen mensen mee die geboren zijn in slavernij. Dat maakt dat alleen in de VS al veel meer zwarte slaven zijn geweest dan witte slaven in Noord-Afrika, maar dat het totale aantal zwarte slaven nóg groter is als de mensen worden meegerekend die in andere delen van Amerika in slavernij zijn geboren.

En ik kan drie groepen mensen bedenken die OP's post downvoten: - Mensen die net zo'n naar wereldbeeld hebben als Baudet - Mensen die niet zo'n wereldbeeld hebben maar geen zin hebben in dit soort content en liever iets anders op de subreddit zien - Mensen die per ongeluk op het pijltje naar beneden hebben geklikt in plaats van het pijltje naar boven, kan gebeuren!",True,0,1512143921,,False,0,dqm2gnx,False,t3_7gv6qy,t1_dqlylrp,/r/thenetherlands/comments/7gv6qy/hoe_nepgeschiedenis_het_slavernijverleden/dqm2gnx/,1514233706,35,False,thenetherlands,t5_30hrx,public,

I really think these small types of communities are the future of neighborhood design - small, self-sufficient communities of 100 to 150 people, where resources such as energy, water, and heat are centralized and shared. Where people's dwellings are designed around a central community center, with things like laundry facilities, a large kitchen, food storage area, project area, a garden, and maybe even resources like a small general store, bakery, and a butcher.

A lot of villages around the world were designed in such a way, and even in Europe now, a lot of small towns are centered around a church/Community center, a local baker, a butcher, and yes, even candlestick maker's.  I've actually lived in a few of these type of places in Germany, and loved them.

StrixTechnica,,,"&gt; It's also about the smuggling of goods to EU via UK.

Of course there will be smuggling.  But it goes on enough already, so why is it suddenly now such a big deal?

&gt; Also about the movement of people - EU don't need random people coming to EU unchecked via UK. UK has to negotiate and resolve these as well.

That's a canard because people with no right of residency or employment visit the UK all the time, whether on a visa or visa waiver.  Immigration borders (as distinct from customs borders) can't distinguish between bona fide travellers, including business travellers, on a valid visa (or waiver) and those who intend to overstay and/or just disappear using fake documents or whatever.

I've never had a problem, for example, visiting the US, Australia or New Zealand on my British passport which does not entitle me to live or work in any of those countries, even when I state the purpose of my visit is business (although, stupidly, Australia doesn't have a visa waiver programme, at least, not for Britons, where you might expect them to).  Immigration border officers are used to such travellers all the time.

In other words, the border is not the place to deal with legal movement of people.  The place to do that is with NHS registration, national insurance applications (thereby collecting up all benefit claimants) and obliging employers to establish the right to work, both of which are currently the case — and perhaps even placing similar obligations on landlords, but I think that's probably OTT because few can live in a country without employment, benefits *and* seeing the doctor on occasion (although, of course, anybody can see an NHS doctor if you pay for it).",True,0,1512144453,,1512144652,0,dqm30ua,False,t3_7gtrc4,t1_dqlwih9,/r/brexit/comments/7gtrc4/tusk_in_dublin_to_meet_varadkar_on_border/dqm30ua/,1514234029,1,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,public,

cockwomblez,,,"**Article text:**

The talks on Britain’s separation from the EU are making progress on the outstanding issues — money, citizens’ rights and the Irish border. When the European Council meets on December 14, it may declare “sufficient progress” and thus allow talks on future relations and the transition to start early next year, as British prime minister Theresa May hopes. But her troubles would be far from over: the future relationship is likely to prove a tougher negotiation than the separation agreement, because the EU will reject what the UK asks for.

The Brexit talks are turning out like accession talks in reverse. When a country joins the EU, the talks are called “negotiations” to humour the applicant. But the EU decides the terms of accession and will discuss only details. Similarly, if Britain wants a separation agreement, it must pay most of what the EU claims it is owed (some €45-€50bn). As for future relations, the red lines set by the British — no freedom of movement, no European Court of Justice and the restoration of regulatory sovereignty — determine the shape of the deal they will be offered.

Some British ministers have a touching faith in the desire of the other 27 members to forge a partnership that maximises economic benefits for all concerned. Unfortunately for the UK, however, the EU’s approach is driven less by economics than by a mix of high principles and low politics. Its principles are to maintain the unity of the 27, the autonomy of its decision-making procedures, and the indivisibility of the single market’s “four freedoms” (of goods, services, capital and people). This means that a country restricting free movement cannot be in the single market. The politics are to protect services firms from UK competition and to steal business in areas such as finance and aviation — while demonstrating to everyone that leaving the EU does not pay. EU officials point out that the UK is not driven by economics, either; if it wanted to minimise the economic damage of Brexit, it would not have rejected the Norway model of staying in the single market.

The British government is not going to publish detailed demands on the future relationship, partly because of its internal divisions. Some voices in London argue that the most realistic option would be to aim for something like the EU’s free trade agreement with Canada and then improve it — leading to “Canada-plus”. But the predominant view is that the UK should request a bespoke model: it would start out closely aligned with EU rules in many areas, so that it had something close to single market membership, but then accept a loss of market access when its rules diverged.

However, Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s chief negotiator, rules out bespoke arrangements or the UK “cherry-picking” parts of the single market. Britain’s red lines, he says, make a Canada-style deal the only viable option. The problem is that this would not suit a service-based economy like Britain’s. The EU-Canada FTA removes most tariffs on goods and opens up public procurement, telecoms and maritime transport. But it does little or nothing in markets crucial to the UK such as aviation, electricity, audio-visual and financial services.

British officials are counting on business lobbies and trade-focused member states to push the commission to be more flexible. So far, however, the 27 remain united behind the hard line set by France and Germany. 

EU officials suggest that the best the British could achieve would be Canada-plus, but that any provisions on services would fall far short of single market membership. For example on aviation, says one official, the EU “will offer UK-based airlines fewer rights and freedoms than they enjoy today”. On financial services, the British line that a deal which hurts the City of London would raise the cost of capital for EU firms cuts little ice. 

In any case, if the British want Canada-plus, rather than just Canada, they will have to pay for it. The closer they get to something like the single market, the more they will be expected to take ECJ rulings, contribute to the EU budget, adopt EU laws and set minimal restrictions on free movement. A generous UK offer on defence and security co-operation might help to increase the size of the “plus”.

The EU’s top priority is to prevent the UK stealing an advantage by undercutting its standards on tax, the environment, social rights, consumer protection and competition policy. “The UK needs to decide if it is leaving the European regulatory model,” Mr Barnier said recently. “The answer to this question is the key to the future relationship.” 

A few months ago EU officials were sceptical that Mrs May could drag her party into accepting the concessions necessary for a deal on separation. Now they are impressed that she has more-or-less pulled off that feat. 

But they still worry that British ministers appear out of touch with reality: some claim that talks on the future economic partnership can be finished before the UK leaves. Yet the EU insists that only the framework for future relations can be achieved before Brexit, and that detailed trade talks will not start before early 2019. That makes the British belief that only two years are needed for the transition — covering the gap between Brexit and the implementation of the new relationship — seem naive. 

Ultimately, however, EU negotiators are cautiously confident that the UK will take an exit deal on their terms — because the alternative is no deal. And they know that Mrs May and her ministers know that, whatever they say in public, any deal is better than no deal.

EmosewAsnoitseuQ,,,"We go through this EVERY royal wedding. and she may not be the *first* black royal but she's the ""first"" black royal. 

I actually think this article does a pretty good job of explaining why it's a big deal and why frankly it deserves a bit of fanfare

[A Mixed-Race Royal Couple? It Wouldn’t Be the First](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/black-princess-meghan-markle.html)

I can't find anyone talking about a black royal beyond Queen Charlotte (after whom Charlottesville was named if i recall correctly). And there's still debate about whether she was even black enough to shock her husband on their wedding day or if it was just a great-great-great-great-grandfather (I've heard it both ways). There are other black royals in other European families but in England it's pretty ""new"". 

Women love weddings. They're programmed socially to do so. Royal weddings are like super weddings. We could make the same argument about the Superbowl and that happens literally every year.

&gt;On the other hand, just last month there was news about an American woman marrying an Ethiopian prince (technically a pretender to the throne, but still), and no one talks about that.

I won't pretend to be fully versed on the grandsons and great grandsons of Haile Selassie so I can't tell exactly which part you are criticizing (parentage, royalty). My sister is MUCH more versed on the history than I am. But I will acknowledge that the story didn't get nearly as much traction as Markle's story. To an extent that was ALWAYS going to be the case. We're talking English royalty. One of the most famous and prominent lines of this contemporary era. Every English wedding is a big deal like this. I actually think that so far this hasn't actually gotten bigger than the other English weddings I know of. People TALK as if it's a bigger deal and it probably IS a bigger deal because of Markle but I don't really think they're more obsessed or fangirling about it than normal.

In general though the black princesses get shafted in terms of global fanfare. I'll agree with that. There's a bunch of black girls who didn't get quite the attention of their American counterparts who married into royal family lines.",True,0,1512145445,,False,0,dqm42sf,False,t3_7gtnm7,t3_7gtnm7,/r/Blackfellas/comments/7gtnm7/why_is_the_royal_engagement_such_a_big_fucking/dqm42sf/,1514234621,3,False,Blackfellas,t5_2xfe1,public,

You'd rather have the Chinese or Germans do it? Because the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, and Italians tried 70 years ago, and they literally murdered, raped, tortured and starved everyone who got in their way--and even about 11 million people they considered rats. The Chinese have never tried, but do you know anything about their culture? The Communist party is essentially the modern incarnation of the Nazi Party--and recently Xi Jinping gave a four hour long speech where he laid out the party's Imperial ambitions--he detailed a plan for Sino domination of the World Order by 2050. His party even came to power by torturing, starving and murdering anyone who disagreed with them--not to mention they still do this to this day--or anyone who was considered more intelligent than the average field hand--around 60 million people. That was actually in the 80's though, so a little closer to modern times. The Japanese tried it once too. Same story but they actually enslaved their POW's and used them as sex slaves or just tortured them for fun. At least the Americans accept all capitalist cultures beneath their umbrella of protection. Dissidents like you under any of these regimes would be summarily executed or imprisoned with your entire family--your sisters and mother would be brutally raped--the children in your family would either be used as sex slaves or murdered with the rest. The babies would be thrown against a sturdy brick wall and curb stomped--all because YOU had the audacity to get on the internet and speak your mind. You really have no idea how good it is now. How can you muster such little respect for those who've literally laid down their lives so you could live in peace and prosperity? That's extremely naive and petulant. How old are you anyways, like 16 or 17? You'll begin to understand things more clearly the older you get. For example, in 2012 the Germans began using Deutsche bank to destroy the economies of their European ""allies""--Greece and Spain and France and Ireland--in order to float the pensions of Germans. After the financial meltdown, it became very clear that the German bankers robbed Germany blind and left it in an incredible debt that had to be dealt with--rather than rob German pensioners (like the Americans did with American pensioners); The Germans began petitioning the IMF and used their significant influence in the EU to engage in economic Imperialism against their allies--essentially the build up of WWI--German Imperialism against their neighbors--at leas the Americans try and make you wealthy (because Americans want to make more money--it's our greatest downfall and our greatest saving grace.)

Also like... When someone makes an argument that ""such and such is clearly a cultural phenomenon of this specific group which is being forcefully changed"", bringing up what happened 2,000+ years ago doesn't seem very relevant. Especially when Rome fell, and all this degeneracy was seen as a predictor that it was over.

MedalLights,,,"I will give you guys an explanation about Jewish ancestry. Jews mainly fall into three groups, Ashkenazi, Sephardic or Mizrahi Jews. 

Ashkenazi Jews lived very recently in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. Sephardic Jews lived mainly in Turkey and North Africa, but are descended from Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Mizrahi Jews are Jews who lived in Iraq, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries and never entered Europe. All three of these groups have similar paternal origins despite living in very different locations. All of them are very similar to Arabs in paternal origin. The paternal line or y-DNA makes up only a small part of one's ancestry. Most of one's ancestry is autosomal DNA. Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardic Jews are very similar to each other in autosomal DNA, and are genetically similar to other Mediterranean people like Sicilians and Cypriots. Ashkenazi Jews are on average about 50% Middle Eastern and 50% European. Mizrahi Jews are not genetically similar to these groups. 

As you know, Judaism is believed to be passed on by maternal lineage according to Rabbinic Jews. Unlike with paternal lineage, where most Jews are similar to each other and Arabs, most Jews have different maternal origins. It is not clear why that is the case, but that is the reality. Some studies argue that a large amount of Ashkenazi maternal lineages come from European gentile women but not everyone agrees with that view. 
 
The Khazar theory has one main issue with it. Ashkenazi Jews are genetically similar to Sephardic Jews from Turkey and Morocco as well as Sicilians, Cypriots and Maltese. It is not possible for there to be a significant Khazarian contribution unless one is arguing these groups also have significant Khazar ancestry, which is not true at all. According to what I have heard, the message from 23andme was about paternal lineage, not autosomal DNA. A small minority of Ashkenazi Jews have R1a paternal lineages (somewhere around 5-12%?) Two Khazarian burials were found recently, and they had R1a paternal lineages. The question is whether some or most of the Ashkenazi with R1a have the same subclade as Khazars did. I do not know the answer to that question but even if it were the case, most Ashkenazi do not have R1a paternal lineages at all. Most have Middle Eastern or Mediterranean paternal lineages. 

I hope this helps people understand Jewish ancestry. ",True,0,1512146501,,1512147039,0,dqm57hc,False,t3_7gsjhh,t3_7gsjhh,/r/conspiracy/comments/7gsjhh/genetic_testing_service_says_a_large_portion_of/dqm57hc/,1514235226,3,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,public,

She complains of her expanding waistline (I suppose she would be termed ""smallfat""), yet I have yet to see her drink anything that is not full-sugar soda. She eats candy and snacks all day, and often orders Chipotle delivered to her. 

Fine, whatever. You do you. But do you...have to comment on me? 

One of our other teammates keeps a jar shaped like a gummy bear on his desk, and regularly puts ""gourmet"" gummy bears in it. If I visit his desk, I usually count out a ""serving"" of five gummy bears. He knows I like the pink bears (strawberry flavor), so he usually tries to set them aside for me. So I'll have five pink bears, and that's my gummy bear allotment for the day.

Brain-Pudding Teammate will easily eat from 1/4 to 1/2 of the little jar.

""How do you only eat FIVE gummies?!"" 

""You drink so much water. How do you not drown?""

""I don't understand how you eat so many vegetables."" Well, that's fine; I didn't ask for your understanding. Besides, I don't understand how your bloodstream hasn't turned to pure sucrose, but I don't feel the need to say this every day.

Prague is gorgeous, one of my favorite cities in Europe. I know they keep it nice for the tourists, but wow, when I went I was so excited and impressed and just super happy to be there. Very fun to explore (nice castle, the Charles Bridge, that central plaza I forget the name of, and cute museums, not a ton of big name museums tho), and feels really “Old World-y”, if that makes sense. It’s also cheap (we ate at the top rated restaurant on TripAdvisor and spent around $60 pp), and we had a gorgeous, centrally located airbnb that was around $40 pp per night. 

Love Edinburgh too!! What a cute, charming city. And tons of things to do. Pretty like Prague but in a different, more British way (which makes sense lol). I think the museums were fine but I don’t remember being astounded? It also depends on what museums you like but I think the entire atmosphere of the city is what stood out to me. 

Amsterdam and Stockholm are nice, but not my favorites (to be fair I only spent 2 days in Stockholm and the rest of my time in Sweden elsewhere). But if you like museums, Amsterdam has the Anne Frank House (and god I’m not a super emotional person but that museum is very sad to be in) and Van Gogh and just a ton of stuff. 

Are you interested in Rome at all? Rome is insanely crazy to walk around because you stumble upon a new ruin or some old palace every five minutes. There’s also easy access to Ostia Antica, which is an incredibly well-preserved Ancient Roman town (before the River Tiber moved it was an important port). Vienna is beautiful too and an easy trip from Prague and has an insane amount of museums. If you like music, well...it’s Vienna need I say more. The Germans and Austrians claim so many of the classical composers.

&gt;
&gt;Come celebrate your winter holiday with Q in his magical wonderland - for the first time, the same Winter Event will be launching on the same day on all three platforms!
&gt;
&gt;This year, the almighty Q drew inspiration from ancient Earth folklore originating from a continent called “Europe.” In said folklore, a half-goat, half-demon figure would punish the naughty. He carried a bundle of birch branches to swat children with, as well a sack on his back reserved for those especially deserving of severe punishment and torture. His counterpart, “Saint Nicholas” would reward good children with sweets and presents, but this figure would give out coal. Naughty children whispered his name in fear... the Krampus!
&gt;
&gt;That was a good start for Q, but the legend needed to be a little more dangerous. It had to scare children throughout the galaxy, not just Earth. After some consideration, he created the perfect holiday terror, a fusion of the Krampus and the demons of the Klingon Empire. He created… the KRAMP’IHRI.
&gt;
&gt;The Kramp’lhri can appear randomly throughout Q’s Winter Wonderland. A fan girl, the Kramp’lhri Watcher, lurks in the pavilion and tracks his movements. She will announce when the object of her idolization is near. Eager to see mortals pit themselves against the dark master, she can happily teleport you into the Kramp’lhri’s projected path.
&gt;
&gt;Once the Kramp’lhri arrives with his loyal minions, stay out of range of his switch! If you anger him, he’ll try to kidnap you as well. Despite the risk, you must fight him, for as he weakens, he’ll lose his hold on the presents he’s stolen. Open those for a chance to find ornaments or free kidnapped Gingerbread folks.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Just when you think you’ve defeated the Kramp’lhri, he’ll turn into a cloud of coal and smoke and try to run to another spot in Winter Wonderland. FOLLOW HIM! Don’t let up on your attacks! The more times you can defeat him in the few minutes he’s active, the better your rewards will be. Perhaps you can even tame him and get him as a pet!
&gt;
&gt;Are you ready to face Q’s newest challenge? Will you survive long enough to free kidnapped gingerbread folks? And who will be the true master of the _Black Nanopulse Mek’leth_? Are you ready to take on...
&gt;
&gt;THE KRAMP’IHRI?!

I'm sure that if we're facing full-scale mass migrations of tens of millions, this will be a rather academic point.  No country will look good.  Struggling countries near the equator and tropics will be repressing their people in order to maintain order.  More prosperous countries will be fighting off refugees.

&gt; Tearing up the agreements regarding refugees will drastically hurt their credibility elsewhere since they will have demonstrated an unwillingness to honor their agreements when the going gets tough.

This has been the case with almost every agreement in history.  Frederick the Great readily abandoned his alliance with Poland in order to take part in the second partition.  Russia abandoned the continental system.  Ideological foes Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  Then Germany broke it, when it thought the time was right.  The USSR abandoned its treaty with Japan in 1945.  Saudi Arabia sits on the UN Human Rights Council.

It's supposed to be March 2019. But the date isn't necessarily fixed, and it's very possible that there will be a transition deal in which the UK would effectively be part of the EU for trade purposes for some years. Soft Brexit and no Brexit are still real possibilities too. If the UK does leave the single market in 2019, it's difficult to imagine any significant trade deals with third countries being agreed by then anyway. Usually negotiations for free trade agreements take years, and I don't think there are any specific plans to start any yet.

They usually fall in the ""everyone else does it"" category, or as /u/Rilgon mentioned, this libertarian pipe dream of ""some scrappy D4 beer-league team could rise to the Pros while [insert hated team here] gets relegated to oblivion, and everything will just work out.""

How many places where there is pro/rel have more than one viable soccer club in the city? How are we going to handle stadia for every podunk club that stands up and every pro-team that has a couple bad years?

We already have owners chasing *new stadiums* by threatening to move their teams.

I just don't see it being a sustainable structure in the US, at least in its pure form. Perhaps having a modified pro/rel system, where teams are either in D1 or D2, D3 or D4, and pretty much between seasons bounce between those two, and every X years have a show down between the teams with the worst records in D2 and the top teams in D3 for a shot at moving between the division groupings. Say 4 years.

I'm not *completely* against pro/rel, but there are a lot of logistics, economics, and other considerations to work out and truth be told, it won't be identical to Europe to begin with, if ever.

But MLS will have to also ensure there are rules in place to dissuade moving a team from a market, like an automatic division-group drop (In D1 and moving to a new city for a new stadium? Awww shucks well it cost you and you get D3 automatically. Sucks to be you, brah.).

OhHiGCHQ,,,"Basically South Korea, America, Europe and China will invade from the South, East and West. The DPRK will be defeated because frankly it has neither the technology nor the resources to do so.

The comes the big problem.

Once the North Korean State collapses, the Allies will face *stiff* resistance from a lot of people. These people live horribly poor lives, but they believe they have it better than everyone else and that America is Satan and the fact Kim Jong Un is gone will just impact that more. North Korea is a cult state, like Nazi Germany, it's people are brainwashed to hate America and it's allies and the US and it's allies invading them will be literally Armageddon for them. To stop this, we need a process of De-kimification. This is going to be harder because while Hitler ruled for 12 years, the Kims ruled for 69. Most people have known nothing but the Kims.

Some will be happy to see the Kims gone, but a lot of people will likely start a resistance group, and a pretty savage one at that.

Then we have the refugees. The North Korean State has collapsed and those poor sods who are already living in absolute poverty are now living even more in poverty *but* they can now leave. There are no North Korean Soldiers you need to bribe or avoid. The South will still be pretty hard to cross, the DMZ is heavily mined and if you cross there, you will likely die. Crossing the Yalu or Tumen will be easy, and I don't know if the Chinese can or will set up guard posts in time. In short: there's going to be a refugee crisis.

In North Korea itself, there is also going to be a Crisis. You now have people who were *just* hovering above rock bottom now hitting rock bottom. The state is gone and they need food. I don't know how many countries are going to dedicate their international aid budget to the DPRK.

Now rebuilding: I don't think the Koreas are going to unify. To get the North Koreans up to Southern standards will require Billions, maybe Trillions of Dollars of investment and work to do and I don't think the South can really do that.

Auckland345,,Fortress Utopia,"Just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it a delusion and that is just an excuse to dismiss it. The reason that the EU became such a big issue is simply because the media and politicians talked about it more and blamed a wide variety of issues on the EU. In fact it wasn’t really a major issue until fairly recently the 2015 election hardly featured the referendum, despite having one party offering one and the other didn’t. [Here] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39717750), is an article pointing that out.  

UKIP only did well during EU elections is because so few voted in them and this is a problem across the EU so is no by limited to the UK. UKIP also rised fairly recently, with still being in single digits in 2012 and I would argue that the reasons why people voted for UKIP was general disillusionment and the EU provided a convenient channel. 

As for the idea that resentment would grew and grew without one I don’t think so. Just like in France where there was fears of the front national gaining ground but we ended up with the unashamedly pro-EU candidate as president and the Front National being in crises, feeling pressure to tone down their message. In fact there were fears across the EU that Brexit would lead to such movements but they have seemed to have fizzed out.

You have most of the Duhcy of Cilicia, but parts of it are under ERE, which is your direct neighbour. To the south, there are few small independent emirates you can easily take over to probably form Kingdom of Syria, but then you border Abbasids.

So the question is: do you remain independent or do you become vassal of Abbasids? I did two runs, first as independent, where I hit a wall after slowly picking Abbasids off and ERE to have 4-5 kingdoms under my direct control but I couldn't form an Empire, as both ERE and Arabian Empire still stood. The second time, a huge Shia rebellion started in Syria, so I couldn't expand, because they had loads of event troops running around, so I became the vassal and then a spymaster and almost completely destroyed the Abbasid line, through plotting and murder, so that I could overthrow and become Caliph of Arab Empire. Once I got that, I started to really expand in every possible way, but then, when I had All of Africa, most of India, Hispania, England and parts of HRE, Hungary and other Central European realms, a revolt happened and my empire fell apart...

Premptive removal of IAP and ready to exit market:

1) If laws are implemented for disclosure (which it seems gungho is avoiding as much as possible) then remove PAD EU from the market. Being premptive in this respect means that you reduce the chances of chargebacks by signalling / blocking players to stop IAPing and just letting them play with what they've gotten to date until the closure.

2) No laws are implemented. No change. Gungho can re-enable IAP if they feel the industry in EU is stabilising. Of course, with such a signaling, the players may already have decided to leave and it's unlikely that the servers will remain. 

Should servers be closed for laws, they will never merge accounts with NA. It would probably get them in legal trouble for trying to avoid EU laws while still trying to milk / serve EU players.

YouPCbra,,,"&gt; for the Flynn Effect to raise racial IQs of non Whites to Whites (would it also raise White IQ?) then wouldn't it just make more sense from a White perspective not to even bother?

Yes this is true but the scientists Flynn himself stated that African american Iq has been growing at 4.6ish% faster then whites in the last century. The idea behind this is that it is one thing to say we can improve conditions and it is another thing to write off entire groups of people as being unchangeable which would lead to some scary conclusions/possibilities. As for the why bother ? Well it is still a possibility that an ethnostate may not exist and that improving various group's iq within the states themselves may be a possibility that is if eugenics doesn't make a comeback.  

&gt;That surprises me. What makes up this 31%? Are they travelers (holiday/vacation)? Scientists? If they are not Muslims and they are not Arabs or even Citizens what are they doing in Saudi Arabia? 

Most are workers that are employed in some sector but stay due to increased salary compared to their home country . Nurses from the Philippines , doctors from Syria, Egypt and Europe, nuclear engineers from South Korea , IT from Pakistan and India etc. As for the make up its quite diverse but a good chunk of the 31% are Muslim yes ,but certainly not the overwhelming majority. These people are of interest to Saudi Arabia and thus stay and coexist because of that and that reason alone. It is a relationship of mutual benefit but there is hardly any intermingling between the populations .It is economic integration in possibility its pure form. The Saudis way of life and living standard is not threatened so they care little , however its also important to understand that the 31% are in some aspects the elite of their respective nations and a far better at working with the system. There are also NO social benefits for these workers so if you are invited then you are an asset not a burden.  This however also includes the sad case of migrant workers on construction and other projects who are in some sense slaves. 

&gt;I must have got some bad information somewhere then. Apologies.

Its no problem ,understandable really. The Saudis and gulf states work but are hardly an industrious people when compared to Germany or Poland that honor goes to the elite Arabs pulling the economic strings of the region. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFpHUzNomlc .

&gt;Really? I knew that they were trying to shift their economy before the oil runs out but I hadn't thought that they had successfully done it yet, at least not to that degree. Do that many people really visit Dubai that tourism outranks their oil output? 

Dubai the city or the UAE the state has deep trade relations with Britain and the whole of Europe due to its historic position on the gulf as a trading port. Keep in mind this is ONLY THE UAE other gulf states are still heavily reliant on oil as their main export and are working to make the shift to diversify their economy and copy the UAE model. This is happening due to the all too real reality that oil won't sustain them forever and they are fully aware of this. Tourism is also a good chunk of their gdp. Check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxa0UDeU7t0 sorry turns out in 2010 only 1% of their gdp was oil .

We are very close in age but I do see a similarity in the preference with the groups . In my school it was mainly the blacks whom hung out with each other , oddly enough though no other group had a preference despite being present in number.  

Also I've taken a deeper look at white farmers in certain regions in Africa and yes I must agree it is abhorrent. I must also add that it seems Africa has always been less welcoming to other cultures then anything I've witnessed or read about. 35,000 Armenians fleeing from the ottomans were welcomed with open arms in Syria despite being christian and this was over 100 years ago when the country was far more conservative. Today they number more then 100,000 . I'm truly interested in why this isn't the case for sub Saharan Africans. Could it perhaps be IQ I wonder ? 

Even the regional conflicts with sunni and shia muslims are largely political and I can assure you you would almost never come across shia and Sunni Muslims who hate each other as individuals and lived peacefully for many periods in history. 

In any case that last part was me attempting to get your take on it.

Ishdalar,na ef,,"Well I'm from EU and I love promotion systems, but I won't shove it down the NA sports culture because I get that franchising is almost a cultural thing there.

So I don't get why we in EU will get franchising imposed into our league, it works great in a 300M+ population country with same culture, language and advertising options, but doesn't ensure results in a diverse continent with many cultures, languages and smaller and more personal markets.

A poll at this point is mostly useless because those things shouldn't be decided that way, most stablished teams will want Franchising because it secures their spot, most fans from those teams will dance to the tune of what Fnatic/G2/etc PR teams wants to sell them and there's this notion that only via franchising we'll be able to contend against NA in the future, but copying a system that has been proved to work in a country in a continent where it hasn't worked yet won't make us more competitive.

There's a reason why Basketball/Football teams have been talking about European Franchised superleagues for the last 25 years but never took the step to do it, somehow now Riot knows better than those clubs?

IHaTeD2,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Yeah I didn't miss that one I was talking about Charlottesville specifically because the guy I was responding to made it seem like it's a common thing and it's not at all (for a right wing attack).

Man your reading comprehension sucks balls.  
First off ""the guy"" you were responding to hasn't changed, secondly I never said anything about right wing attacks.   

&gt;Also, just a side note, new video evidence shows that Heather Hyer (the victim of that incident) actually may not have been hit by his car and actually just had a heart attack instead.  

How utterly convenient, just how everyone who was for Trump suddenly isn't anymore in the light of some revelations and instead planted by the Dems, Soros or Israel. Stop trying to spin shit around all the time when it is inconvenient for you.    

&gt;Both horrible and directly attributed to him plowing into everyone but I think it changes the situation slightly.  

I honestly don't see how that changes the situation, that guy wanted to drive into some evil leftists and did exactly that. And it isn't the car or the driver that kills you but the result of that attack - if it is a heart attack or a blood clot sometimes later because your head hit the ground or car isn't of relevance to me.  

&gt;And the one you linked to is another Islamic extremist shit for brains attack which helps further my first point. They happen frequently and they kill lots of people.  

Your first ""point"" was ""trucks of peace"" are frequent in Europe, frequent enough even to use it as kind of a stereotype which is complete bullshit.

Original Post: 

&gt; So stats canada has a Labor Force Survey which they claim is mandatory, where once a month for 5 months some asshole will come to your house with a laptop and ask extremely detailed questions, and you cannot opt out. if you get lucky they will do it by phone but most people claim they come in person at least once. StatsCan claim opting out will result in jail time or $500 fine, quoting legislation that is written specifically for Census and explicitly mentions surveys are excluded and not mandatory. It also is against Canadian charter of rights for the goverment to invade your privacy with the exception of census. I read online that they take a couple of people from every province that refused it or dodged it and prosecute them as an example. Most cases get thrown out but some unlucky fuckers get $300 fine and 20-50 hours community service. I get the point of census and don't mind it, but mandatory ""sit in your house interrogations"" are a big no no for me after dealing with police back in eastern europe.

tonylaponey,,,"Yeah I disagree with that.  My view:

Liberal left leaning people probably like the idea of equality and the chance for people to seek a better life in the UK, so they will support some migration and immigration.  It's hyperbole to say that they support *mass* immigration though.  

Left wing people can also be traditionalists as well though, and not be that fond of immigration.  And social conservatives will object to immigration because they see that it dilutes social values etc. they hold dear.  Most of these people are just a bit old fashioned but racists and xenophobes are an extreme examples of this on both sides. 

However fiscal conservatives *love* the free market and they *love* immigration because of the competition it brings for both skilled and unskilled labour. 

The Conservative party is in theory socially Conservative, but many of them are aggressive fiscal conservatives and their funding definitely is.  So whilst they are currently talking a nice game on immigration and British values etc I don't buy it.  The money behind them wants more immigration, not less. As home sec May was either totally incompetent on immigration or deliberately didn't reduce it.

swedishplayer97,,Please Excuse My Brain-Hound - He Savors Your Thoughts,"The **Pacific War** began when the Japanese Empire launched a surprise attack on the battered United States in 1999. They held onto Los Angeles, some west coast beaches and Alaskan islands for little over a year before being pushed back to the ocean. Since then, the war has been ongoing, but is starting to wane for the Japanese, as the Sino-Indian Pact has entered the fray and liberated mainland China. The U.S. mounted an amphibious invasion of Kyushu in 2016, and are planning to invade Tokyo next spring.

Most analysts believe the end of the Japanese Empire is nigh, but wonder whether the Japanese people will truly surrender. They revere their emperor as a god, so successfully holding the islands would be difficult. Furthermore, controversy has struck as news of Japanese superweapons reach home, one supposedly capable of disabling an entire city.

The **Tripartite War**, meanwhile, began as a border skirmish between the Soviet Confederacy and Persian Empire in the Caucasus in 2007. It was caused by the angered European Coalition, who wanted to reclaim the lands they lost to the Confederacy. The war saw little progress until 2013, when a platoon of Turkish soldiers were killed by a Persian air strike. The Coalition entered the war, and has since captured Syria, northern Iraq and most of Lebanon, while barely holding on to northeast Turkey and Eastern Europe is locked down. While the Soviets and Persians continue to fight in the Caucasus and Central Asia, their hostility is starting to lessen as they suspect the Coalition is behind something.

The European Coalition hopes to win the war in order to regain their former glory, but back home, the people are restless.

Hence the 2009 Pandremix colossal narcolepsy fuck-up.  

One fifth of the European population carries a dormant gene for narcolepsy.  One out of five.  Not that they'll necessarily GET narcolepsy, but that they carry a piece of DNA that can be activated to cause it.  

2009's European swine flu vaccine contained an adjuvant - Pandemrix - that subsequently induced manifestation of narcolepsy in a thousand European children.  A permanent, debilitating condition that will cripple these children forever.  

How did it happen?  The vaccine adjuvant affected that dormant gene (that one in 5 Europeans carry) and triggered it.

European children receiving this vaccine (who had this gene variation) were up to 13 times (depending on the country) more likely to become narcoleptic.  Forever.  The end.  

It's not just an allergy.  The vaccine actually interacted with personal genetics to cause this tragedy.  

This one was obvious after so many kids started showing symptoms of the disorder so soon after vaccination.  Who knows to what level other interactions are taking place when your kids get their vaccines.

Hltchens,,,"We need to stop this.  No one is ever going to take libertarians seriously with elementary ideas like these. We've seen, time and time again, from China, to America and back to China and all other coutries that whore themselves out for cheap labor: if a company doesnt have to abide, they won't.  Do the people of taiwan get to pick between one company that won't pollute the main river, and one that will? No, because the companies already own the government there. Which easily brings me to my next point. 

Companies need an entity larger than them, more powerful than them, to regulate and protect the people that entity derives power from. Obviously we know, today, that the dollar is power, and so the entity with the most money wins. This is currently the US Government. It's the most powerful because every citizen in the US has to buy their subscription through taxes.  In return this government now has an incentive to keep us from dying, keep disposable money flowing through the entire spectrum of socioeconomic status and keep us healthy and able to work as long as possible.  All things that I would argue achieve common good in America. This incentive to protect the People, the most important one, has led to the most powerful, well funded, and advanced military in the world. The two largest air forces, the largest navy by far, and the most portable nuke silos (Ballistic subs). 

What America is today is a safe haven for companies that wish to have their assets protected.  America is a great investment right now, as opposed to say, the Middle East, or Europe, where tax rates can be blindingly high. Companies the involve themselves in war also take sanctuary here. Raytheon, Lycoming, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Remington.... companies that will never have to subject themselves to the rule, penalties or imprisonments of anyone besides the USA; and as long as they play by our rules (no selling that stuff to enemies, abide by regulations, pay taxes etc) they can keep playing the game.  They can go and say, ""come and try and take our money and countrymen you swede fucks,"" or whoever the case may be. Hypothetically, whatever international court decides it's going to sue Remington for damages in WWII; you know, some ridiculous New World Order outlandish situation that may never happen.. but wont *matter* if it does anyway because: USA. We take some extreme liberties on Earth, that really no other countries enjoy, thanks to the wording of our constitution. We are Gods among men, and that privilege/cheat code costs money, so pay up. 

We offer companies and people of the world great incentive.  Unbeatable protection, a chance to play the free market in whatever legal way you want, and a promise that you will never have to answer to a war crimes tribunal or international court.  This service requires a fee (it is the free market after all and the US Government gets to charge a subscription fee, just like any other private military would) and those who pay the fee live freely, knowing they are part of the best country in the world.

Fuckfactsdownvote,,,"Except you have literally zero evidence of that only one Russian company has ever been found to be in violations of sanctions and they were not direct. They were selling to a Singapore based company, which was actually owned a Chinese company that was actually owned by North Korea. Go ahead and provide any source for Russian assistance. North Korea had to get SCUD designs to start their rocket program from China. They had to get uranium enrichment from Pakistan in exchange for helping Pakistan's missile program which is why the Ghauri-I is based off the Hwasong-7. Then they stole engine designs from the Ukrainian Yuzhmash plant and they were even caught doing it before. 

So go ahead and show me any source for Russia giving North Korea R&amp;D or money. Hell, have you seen the Russian economy how do you think they're throwing money away? If only North Korea had some massive economy next door that was throwing money regionally, had previously helped their missile program, helped supply them with uranium enrichment technology by smuggling it from Pakistan, hates South Korea and to top it all off set up North Korea on their version of GPS called BeiDou and that would also boycott South Korea for putting in THAAD to protect itself from North Korean missiles.

From Bryan Clark, a retired U.S. Navy undersea warfare officer and analyst the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments

&gt;From the short time between failed missile ejection and successful ejection (Nov 2015-July 2016), it would appear that North Korea is receiving technical help from the Chinese. If you look at how long it took the Chinese and Indians to develop their indigenous SLBMs and SSBNs (15-20 years), North Korea is progressing much more rapidly especially in correcting issues after failures

When North Korea debuted the Pukkuksong-1 last year it was so close to the Chinese JL-1 it was originally thought to actually just be a Chinese JL-1. 

China has helped North Korea every step of the way, they are still helping North Korea and even assisting North Korea in submarine production. But apparently it is the Russians? China is literally pissing on us, telling us it is lemonade and instead of blaming the guy with his dick out we're complaining about slavs squatting in Adidas tracksuits in Eastern Europe.  

Even take UN Resolution 1718 where sanctions were imposed the UN Security Council (UNSC) on North Korea. It was only not vetoed by China after removing an embargo and that ships must comply with inspections. China was the only nation that wanted those parts removed because China is the nation that is illegally sending things to North Korea constantly.

If Vietnam ever gets up to some wacky nuclear shenanigans then that is probably Russia. The general breakdown of allegiances in that region is China-Pakistan-North Korea and Russia-India-Vietnam. Even look at trade, China-North Korean trade this year was estimated at $2.6 billion already at the start of July. China has increased trade with North Korea despite the sanctions. Russian-North Korean trade for all of 2016 was valued at $76.9 million. The CFR estimates that 70% of everything exiting or entering North Korea comes through Chinese waters. Even historically during the Korean War the Soviets only sent pilots because Mao personally went to Stalin to try and get support in 1951. There is a long, unbroken string of China-North Korean relationships from the 1950's to the modern day.

There will be no governing body to stop an ISP from throttling porn sites that aren't willing to pay up to keep hosting the literally trillions of HD porn vids.

---

Take something more mainstream for example. Netflix is a competing service to an ISP; it'll get throttled in the US - Netflix can pay the ISP to stay competitive in speeds - in turn they have to charge customers more to stay profitable - all Netflix subscriptions prices rise worldwide to compensate.

---

Not that I expect the ISP's to be hosting a competing porn site, just that they eat tons of bandwidth, host millions of videos, and absolutely don't have the same level of revenue as something like Netflix or YouTube, they're going to be easy targets for ISP's to throttle, and ransom; and that will affect all users worldwide if that service is based in the US.

---

Don't worry though OP, Porn isn't going to be illegal or anything (Except the stuff that is already illegal). But ISP's may likely turn their attention to porn sites in the near future because of their typical hosting, bandwidth usage, and that they think not many people are going to publicly defend porn sites.

I've already acknowledged that the terms have different meanings in Europe

Those meanings are common in the US as well. 

&gt;Antifa are socialists, not anarchists.

They are both. They are the [syndicalists](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2465?rskey=ASdtRc&amp;result=1). Marx was an anarchist, in a way, but the syndicalists did not believe he was anarchist enough as he believed in a rule by the proletariat. By contrast, syndicalists believed in no rule other than that of the natural law. However, they believe that in an anarchist state that people would form communes by which everyone would share the fruits of their labor. They pose that this is the natural order of things. Of course, this is quite obviously not how people work. But that doesn't change that their beliefs are anarchists.

&gt;They don't live with no rules, they want everyone to live under their rules.

Anarchist doesn't mean ""no rules."" [Here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/) is a reading of what anarchism is. But antifa does want no rules... They want no rules to exist at all and support violence for their cause. A common theme in anarcho-syndicalists. It is a rule without rules, in a sense, but they believe in a natural law where their communes will come out superior and they believe there will be no need of government. Again, they are quite obviously wrong in this belief.

People being upset about how Jamaicans can have a different definition of white/black than Americans. 

Americans calling someone black when they have 25% African ancestry is okay, but apparently calling someone who is clearly mainly with European ancestry Caucasian is an ignorant act.

You act as if the way the US treats race is the only correct way to do it. You're essentially saying that there is some logical basis as to why someone who's 50% white and 50% black is considered black, and think that anyone who thinks they're white is ignorant. In reality, there is no logical reason why we call someone 50-50 as black. We maybe possibly would refer to them has half-black (stand alone), but we don't call them half-white (stand alone).

Why is white neutral? Why is white the default? Why is it that other races are the ones that we highlight? Could it possibly be because we're in a country mainly run by (especially historically) by white people? Where white people are traditionally the majority and the most powerful? Like how black is the neutral, default in Jamaica? Therefore being a high portion of white being highlighted is perfectly natural for them?

a0x129,,5∆,"The citizens of a given territory are ultimately in control, whether the government agrees with that premise or not. The reason is just simple logistics: Asad is one man, without the people he has nothing.

The right to criticise leaders is an important one, again even if the leader doesn't like it. It's a universal right that can't really be denied: the moment a strong-arm dictator pushes against it, they lose either in the long term or short term. Asad lead a brutal regime that already screwed up in this realm, so strike 1.

Attacking people who are protesting your government is in itself a pretty shitty thing to do, and completely ignores the relationship that a ruler has with the ruled. Just being the top guy doesn't make you able to just do anything, like opening fire on protesters. Strike 2.

So, just into the Arab Spring, Assad effectively lost control of his territory by losing the faith and respect of his own people and having to resort to violence in order to keep them in line. Whether everyone in Syria agreed with the protests is rather moot. Enough people disliked Assad. And the only people really backing him were the ethnic minority (the name escapes me) that he's from. Had Assad wanted to keep the peace and hold his country together, he would have allowed for truly free and fair elections, open criticism of his government, and even when things got bad bowed out and let someone else take the wheel. Assad had no interest in these things, he's interested in power and control of his territory by any means necessary.

Had he taken more early steps to mitigate the true problems instead of just pandering a few items here and there, Syria wouldn't be a problem. He never held Syria above himself.

Strike 3 was the method in which the war has been conducted, the use of chemical weapons which outside international groups have confirmed to be of the Syrian Army. Wholesale slaughter of his people: he's done.

The international community can't abide by that.

None of this, mind you, gives a pass for the absolute clusterfuck that international military involvement has had in this, from Russia and the US, to Iran and Saudi Arabia. Everyone of those groups has failed miserably and owns some of the blame of the bloodbath, the rise of ISIS, etc.

Just because the international military interventionists were wrong, doesn't mean Assad was right.

Ultimately the reason for the international involvement is resources. Russia wants control of pipelines running through Syria, the US/EU would rather those not be in Russia's control. The initial uprising is where Assad failed miserably and could have avoided all of this had he been a decent human being and stopped being a selfish butthole.

My view is really that Assad needs to go mainly because there is no reasonable way he can govern the nation-state. He's lost all credibility, he'll never be able to move beyond being a violent, oppressive dictator toward a free democratic society. He could have done that early on.

The international community needs to stop dicking around and playing their damn resource proxy war.

Például Kanadában nemrég fogadtak el egy törvényt ami arra kényszerít mindenkit hogy a transzfesztitákat csakis az általuk választott valamelyik 83 új gender pronoun-nal szólíthatssák (pl. „zhe” v „zher”) különben vét a törvény ellen és eljárás indul ellene „under provincial human rights laws”:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#Of_Bill_C-16

Ez a kanadai professzor Jordan Peterson hosszasan beszél a youtube-on arról (ott óriási sztár lett nemrég, érdemes követni értelmes csávó) hogyan szállta meg és mára uralja teljesen a nyugati egyetemeket ez a posztmodernista söpredék - érdekes módon pont amit én is tapasztaltam.

Egy másik példa: Obama teljes mértékben elhiszi azt a genderista hazugságot hogy ma Amerikában egy nő ha ugyanazt a munkát végzi mint egy férfi csupán 79%-át kapja a férfi fizetésének.

„Obama said it was time for tough action to close the gender pay gap. Women still earn just 79 cents to every dollar paid to a man more than 50 years after the passing of the Equal Pay Act designed to stamp out gender pay discrimination.

“We’re talking about folks doing the same job but being paid different,” the president said in a speech in White House. “What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?”

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/obama-outlines-rules-for-closing-gender-pay-gap

Ez a csávó az USA elnöke volt 8 évig Trump előtt.

Tehát azt állítani hogy ezek a baloldali vadhajtások csupán 19 éves csitrik hormonális felindulásból elkövetett tetteire szorítkoznak a valóság olyan szintű nem-ismerésére vall hogy nehéz megérteni „honnan jössz” hacsak nem hordassz egy nagyon durva baloldali szemellenzőt.

Esetleg nem véletlenül az első generációs menekültek leszármazottai? Akkor viszont meg hogyan lehet komoly arccal olyat leírni hogy „tehát az első generációs menekültek nem veszélyesek” mikor belőlük lesz az a réteg aki mlg vernazza szerint is terrorista lesz?

Mi a garancia arra hogy lehet bárkit is asszimilálni? Miért nincs szó sosem a bevándorlók felelősségéről az integrációban („kettőn áll a vásár”)? Mennyibe kerül egy társadalomnak a sok bevándorló? Hajlandóak volnánk egyálatlán ennyit költeni erre ? Miért nem kérdezik meg a többségi társadalmat mielőtt rájuk szabadítják a fél világot (szerintem ez volna a minimum)?

Az pedig tény hogy a Sharia törvények összeférhetetlenek és összeegyeztethetetlenek a felvilágodás utáni európai értékrenddel és a mára a legtöbb (nem muszlim) országban elfogadott általános emberi szabadságjogokkal úgy mint a szólásszabadsággal (Allahot nem szabad kritizálni - sőt még magát Mohamedet lerajzolni sem szabad amint azt a dán karikatúristánál láthattuk halál jár érte!), nők jogaival (előírják nekik hogyan öltözzenek, a férfi megverheti a nőt ha hűtlenséget gyanít), melegek jogai („Homosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam) akkor ilyen apróságok hogy ha egy iszlám hitű elhagyja a hitét akkor azért halálbüntetés jár. **Ezek csupán azok az alapok amit a mérsékelt muszlimok is osztanak emiatt már ők sem integrálhatóak.**

„78% of Muslims thought that the publishers of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed should be prosecuted, 68% thought those who insulted Islam should be prosecuted and 62% of people disagree that freedom of speech should be allowed even if it insults and offends religious groups„

http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/291

Tehát egyáltalán nem igaz amit írsz hogy csak néhány szerencsétlen „bad apple” a probléma. Nem.

A mérsékeltek iszlám hívők IS a probléma részei.

https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/10-reasons-not-peace.aspx

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AkAGc5nOXw

A mai keresztényeket pedig nem lehet a mai iszlám hívőkhöz hasonlítani:

1, leszarják a Bibliát, senki nem fog gyilkolni az ótestamentumi Isten nevében ez a veszély egész egyszerűen nem létezik

2, nincs utánpótlás lassan nem lesz pap mert senkit nem érdekel az egész a fiatalok körében (a muszlimoknál az a minimum ha az apád muszlim volt te is az vagy teljesen mindegy mit szeretnél) miközben az átlag gyerekszám is gyatra a muszlimokhoz képest

3, a keresztény kultúra az európai történelmi fejlődés szerves része (sokak szerint az alapja). Az iszlám nem az, sőt, Európa egyik legfőbb történelmi ellensége volt sokáig (spanyol reconquista, török hódítások Kelet-Európában)

Gyakorlatilag van a szerencsétlen elmebeteg izolált Breivik akire az iszlám szerecsenmosdatói tudnak mutogatni hogy „lám a keresztények sem különbek” meg néhány szintén izolált szekta amerikában és kész kifújt ennyi.

Mi közben az EU-ban 2015 óta lassan megszokjuk hogy nem telik el szinte hónap egy újabb iszlám terorista merénylet vagy próbálkozás nélkül. Eközben a német hírszerzés feje azt mondja lehetetlen ennyi embert megfigyelni amennyit beengedtek, túl sok a potenciális terrorista.

Mi a megoldás?

Szerintem egyértelmű: nem beengedni a muszlim tömegeket. 

Nyugat Európának már késő, ők egyék meg amit főztek számukra egyszerűen már nem opció semmilyen szép megoldás:

1, Vagy a vernazzai úton mennek végig: miközben a helyi álértelmiség a szokásos „ez egy bonyolult probléma” hangzatos üres lózunggal a szőnyeg alá söpri a problémát (azaz nem csinál semmit) a muszlimok szépen túlszülik a helyi lakosságot és pár generáció múlva megkerülhetetlen politikai erő lesznek, végül kalifátust csinálnak Nyugat-Európából

2, Vagy deportálnak minden muszlimot aki a Sharia törvényeket tekinti mérvadónak 

Egyik sem szép de ez a kialakult tragikus szituáció a Merkelek és vernazzák történelmi bűne.

SupaZupa,,,"&gt;Ah, yes. Because an alliance with a foreign power is totally the same thing as *collaborating with fucking Nazis*.

National Socialist Workers' Party share a very similar trait with the EU, and that is their love of Statism. So I will stand by my original observation.

&gt;Hitler was a vegetarian. Are all vegetarians Nazis now?

What a deflection, if this was a game of football that would have been a spectacular shot. I think I can go one better though, and in all hope, I'd like you to ponder it.

Hitler was also a politician, ergo, most politicians have the capability to become the next Hitler.

&gt;Which ethnic populations does the EU want to destroy?

It wishes to destroy nation states, ergo, it wishes to destroy nationalities. No borders means no boundaries, and that is the road to ruin for any nation.

&gt;Oh, and also: what did you expect to gain by voting Leave? Does any of that sovereignty/manna from heaven seem to be coming?

It has been a roller coaster tbh. I have very little faith in the political bastards currently in charge, UK &amp; EU, and do fear a stitch-up. I see problems no matter how the final deal is but nothing insurmountable.

I honestly believe though that once our own parliamentarians become accountable for their actions, with no recource to swan off to another 'official political' position, they may actually start doing their job.

The future was going to be difficult any which way the EUref had ended. The EU is facing many pressing issues too, which would have cost just as much effort to fix.

bobadobalina,MURICA,USA,"&gt;The pilgrims that left England for religious purposes did such so they could worship God in the way they believed. They were still Christian. 

The point being so, as you said, they could worship God in the way they believed- even non-xian ways

&gt;It's a very far cry than what I'm suggesting. If you were to apply the religious state of England to to day, you'd have a single denomination where anyone that did not adhere to that denomination's practices, including atheists would be put in prison or killed. I'm pretty sure I'm not advocating for atheists to be killed.

It's not a far cry at all. What you are saying is that people are not ""real"" patriots if they do not adhere to the tenets of xianity. 

We are a little more civilized now so you aren''t killing non-xians but you are alienating them

&gt;It doesn't mean a government cannot create laws based on moral values.

Our government creates laws based on the will of the people, not xian morals.

A good example being legal abortion. Certainly not endorsed by xians but approved by the people of this country 

&gt;You agree with Prager, but you do not take it to the next logical step. Our government and our laws are a product of our society and our society is a product of our moral values, regardless of where they came from.

Let's take a look at pre-refugee invasion Europe. Safe, clean countries with little crime and very little violence. Not a lot of poverty. Rare civil unrest- all in all nice places to live.

In the Netherlands, society's moral values say it's okay to bang whores and do drugs. In Spain the age of consent is 13. In Norway girls sunbathe topless in public parks. German kids drink beer like our kids drink milk. 

Now look at ""xian"" America where all of those things are heavily regulated or flat out illegal. Take a stroll on the south side of Chicago

Why is it that sinful, hell bound Europe has such a peaceful and successful society and God fearing America is such a mess? 

Prager is wrong. Personal morals do not directly translate into how a society functions


&gt;You keep boiling it down to adherence to the Constitution. Yet, in doing so, you've never explained why that is a conservative principle. What makes it so great? Why is it worth following? 

OMG, father, did you really ask that? What is the Constitution all about? Freedom. It tells us that we are free, explains how we should exercise our freedom and provides means of defending it

A conservative believes in a nation of laws, states rights, as little government as we can get and *the ability to live your life as you want to.*


&gt;If you follow the answers to those questions, you'll end up having to evaluate the values of the founders themselves of whom many acknowledge God and the goodness of Christian values.

And some were deists and some were Pagans and one particularly influential gentleman had a fondness for hellfire clubs- the meeting places of ""persons of quality"" who wished to take part in socially perceived immoral acts. The members were often involved in politics.

&gt;The less moral a society becomes, the more authoritarian a government becomes in order to keep that degrading moral society from tearing themselves apart. 

Really? You going to tell that to Rome? When Constantine banned all of the other religions in the Empire and declared Rome to be an xian nation it destroyed the Pax Romana and the Roman Empire itself (which was his intent)

&gt;Do you think the moral clash between right (conservatism) and left (liberalism) is coincidence? 

No. It was caused by *the very thing we are talking about*

The left operates by catering to those who feel disaffected, marginalized, isolated and victimized.

When conservatism demanded the adherents follow xian values, that played right into the left's hands. 

Gays, women who wanted abortions, men who enjoyed free wheeling sex and young people sowing their wild oats certainly did not gravitate to a movement that thought they were filth doomed to burn in hell. 

So here comes the left. Hey, gay people, we'll fight to make faggotry legal and fight for your right to marry. Women, we will get you your abortions and throw in free birth control. Men, fuck who you want, we'll even help you cover it up by keeping it out of our media. Yeah, kids those nasty old people have all the money and they don't deserve it. Let's spread it around. While you're at it, have some legal drugs.

Your kind made politics a moral issue and, as a result, handed this country over to the leftist commies and squashed the conservative movement.

And I am going to do my best to see that does not happen again 

&gt;However, in doing so, one cannot help but acknowledge the keen similarities between Christian values and conservative values.

There are no similarities, reverend. Going back to your astonishing question about The Constitution, xianity is the exact opposite of conservatism

Let me reiterate. A conservative believes in a nation of laws, states rights, as little government as we can get and *the ability to live your life as you want to.*

An xian believes in an endless array or rules, regulations and laws. The believe in one *unelected* government over all men. There are no rights aside those it allows you to have. And every Sunday you listen to (or are) someone laying down edicts about how you spend your money, conduct your sex life, manage your relationships, raise your kids and how to live every aspect of your life. Even what words you are allowed to use. 

Xianity does not even care about you. It cares about what you do for god and for other people (socialism)

&gt;And going back even further, no one is forcing you to become Christian. If you don't believe, then don't. You're not going to get kicked out. 

If you demand that conservatives follow xian values, you are either forcing them to follow the herd or be pariah. As noted above, that's what makes leftists

&gt;Yes, some of us would believe you'll end up in hell separated from God, 

Actually the bible never mentions people being sent to hell or going to heaven. I got tons to back that up. But its another discussion for another place


&gt;but we're not shunning or looking down on you for that. 

Yeah, ""you're such a filthy piece of shit that you deserve to burn in endless pain but we don't think less of you for it""

Do you people even listen to yourselves?

&gt;Yeah, we may want you to come closer to Christ because we do want to you see in Heaven

If it did exist, why would I want to spend eternity in a place who's general law is ""anything you enjoy is bad""? Oh yeah, you get a mansion on a nice golden street but you can't even watch porn (only god is allowed to do that)

&gt;If sharing Bible verses offends you, 

When are you going to get off this? Can your xian mind not accept that a *bible scholar* does not buy into the religion? That's because I know the bible and you xians got it all fucked up. 

&gt;then I suggest you really take the time to consider what this sub has become and what it's all about. 

It has become a place for free thinkers of all moral views to come and discuss issues important to this country and to enjoy seeing it get back to what it should be. It's not Wednesday evening bible study

&gt;Because arguing that Bible verses don't belong on T_D is very similar to that the rest of reddit has been doing and trying to do to T_D itself.

They don't belong here just as political posts don't belong on r biblebeater (or whatever)

Monsignor, you just gotta accept the fact that you don't own conservatism. I smoke, I drink, I screw women I am not married to, i watch porn and know- not think- know that xianity as it is preached and practiced is a joke based on a lie (the heaven and hell thing) 

Yet I defy you to find someone more based than I am. I have been a Trump supporter for literally over 20 years

The Trump train is heading to a Great New World and doesn't stop at churches. Get on or wave goodbye

pisshead_,,,"&gt; What we do know is the basic fact that reusable rockets cost more upfront but get cheaper the more often they can launch the same stage over and over again.

Except the Falcon 9 was cheaper even before re-use. Unless you're privy to insider SpaceX financials then you don't know how much it saves them to re-use a rocket. The only thing Ariane has going for it is the subsidies which SpaceX doesn't get. They claim Ariane 6 will be cheaper but a rocket in the hand is worth two in the bush, and SpaceX isn't getting more expensive. 

&gt;And there lies the big problem, the European space market isn't as big as the American and even worse, while the American government (and Russian and Chinese) is forced by law to only buy American rockets, European governments are not.

Well, there are no European launchers, Ariane is a French company and most European companies have little or no stake in it. Forcing Europeans to use European rockets would give Ariane a monopoly because there is no competition in Europe, unlike in America where there are three launch providers and soon to be four. There's no reason the European space market should be smaller than the American one, Europe is rich and has a lot of people.

&gt;Germany is going to launch new intel satellites on a Falcon 9, the US government would never ever launch a spy satellite on an Ariane rocket, even if it would be cheaper or better suited for the mission.

America is launching the JWST on the Ariane 5 so you're not being entirely honest there. Germany doesn't have a launch provider anyway, they have to go foreign. Without Falcon 9 a lot of European countries wouldn't be able to launch things because Ariane 5 is expensive and has a huge backlog.

Ja nyt vähän suhteellisuudentajua tuohon ""romahdukseen"". Lontoo on ollut maailman suurimman imperiumin pääkaupunki ja aikoinaan maailman suurin kaupunki ja on nytkin yksi maailman suurimpia kaupunkeja, sekä yksi maailman tärkeimpiä kaupunkeja tälläkin hetkellä. Se vetää ihan helkkaristi ulkomaista työvoimaa. Ja EU:n vapaan liikkuvuuden takia kuka tahansa EU:n kansalainen on voinut muuttaa Lontooseen.

Ihan vertailun vuoksi New Yorkissa on suhteellisesti vielä enemmän ulkomailla syntyneitä kuin Lontoossa. Sitä se teettää olla globaalisti erittäin keskeinen suurkaupunki globalisoituvassa maailmassa.

* **Faction:** cross-faction
* **Type of Guild:** social, PvE, trading (if we have a trader, well, not this moment, but we're bidding always :))
* **Current member number:** 80+

&amp;nbsp;

**Our guild, the ""WEB"" (Wealth-Equality-Brotherhood)** is an international, English-speaking social (kind of) guild, founded in Spring 2015, now with more than 80 members, with 95% active in a a month, more than the half in 1-2 days. We were aiming to create a fun community based on thievery, sadly there wasn't any content implemented which would have helped this, so we reformed ourselves as a general guild. We could finish lots of in-guild trial-runs, and still planning more, including veteran runs also (on Mondays and Thursdays, starting at 9.00pm CEST). We could clear vAA, vHRC (speedruns also) and vSO HM; the main target is vMoL (one day in the future, after a lot more vet trial completions..... :)).

&amp;nbsp;

We have players with characters from every class, race, role and playstyle, we have members from all of the alliances, while we are mainly PvE-oriented, so this won't carry any real importance. We have some basic rules, mostly about friendly behaviour, no-drama, no-rudeness, respect etc. **Our players are friendly, social, chatty and (mainly) mature guys (and girls :)), lots of us with family, job and pet, so our frequent playing hours are in the evening.**

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR We need more active and chatty players**, it is better if you're above CP160, but it's not a problem if you're below it, we've never been against those members, who were quite newbies. If you want to be our member you should be active in the evening hours, able and keen to do group content, shouldn't be arrogant and disrespectful, or childish (while we are not against good humour). 

Have no fear if you're basic in English, we won't force you to use any Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software (while we have a Discord server); please just be quick in typing and reading :) The only exceptions are the trial runs: those need voice coordination, so at least you have to be able to listen and follow.

vanderZwan,,,"Whenever I see a piece about fertility rates, whether it is the low fertility rate in Western countries, or the supposedly high one in African countries, I can't help but think [of this wonderful piece of ""looks like satire but it rings too true for that""](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/11/europe-africa-overpopulated-global-population) by Mawuna Remarque Koutonin thatis so short I'll just cite it in full:

&gt; When you arrive in Europe for the first time, the first shock you get is seeing how overpopulated the place is, especially the western part.

&gt; A small country like France, which is five times smaller than the Democratic Republic of Congo, has about the same population – 67 million inhabitants. The UK is smaller than Gabon, but has a population of more than 60 million inhabitants, compared to Gabon’s population of just over 1.5 million. The worst example is a micro country like Belgium (just over 30000 km square, 167 times smaller than the Congo) which has a population of 11 million. That’s 365 people per km square, compared to the DRC’s rate of 30. 

&gt; The first question you ask yourself is how they manage to feed themselves in a resource-poor continent like Europe? Why do they have so many kids when Europe is already the only continent to send more than half a billion economic and political refugees to other richer places of the world during the last five centuries? Is it because of the high fertility rate of their men or because of the cold weather which forces them to spend lots of time inside with only one activity left … copulation!

&gt; For many people concerned about overpopulation, Africa takes the centre of attention because of the recent growth of its population. But the concept of overpopulation is a fraud and a convenient ideology, because it ignores impact per capita (per one person) and focuses on simple numerics.

&gt; In reality, the USA consumes 25% of the world’s resources while its population is only 5% of the total. The west as a block - the USA and Europe - represents slightly less than 15% of the world’s population, but its consumption far outstrips most of the rest of the world, with one study finding that the US, Europe and Japan together suck up 80% of the world’s natural resources.

&gt; Africa, as a whole, has a population smaller than China, and a total GDP which is half that of a small country like France. Considering that it’s an already overpopulated continent, it’s surprising that many European countries give incentives to families to make more babies. And, for an already underpopulated continent, Africa is crowded with western overpopulation experts giving money to NGOs and governments to stop population growth. In the meantime, China is abandoning its one child policy to boost its population. 

&gt; It is only in Africa that we talk about having population reduction funded by western NGOs and governments. Is it because Africa does not have resources to feed 2 billion people? No. It’s because some other nations want those resources for their own people instead.

&gt; I hope you won’t bite on this new covert war on the poor – another distraction from the real culprits. The world is overpopulated, so let’s have less rich people. That should be the real agenda.

So if I see something like:

&gt; To boost fertility, we need creative and large policies, alongside significant social and cultural change.

igilix,,"Runora - magic, politics, and miniature furry dragons","Well, in Runora, there are a lot of cities. The continent is essentially the size of Eurasia, with pretty large islands and archipelagos sprinkled about. The most important cities depend on where you live. Since the main characters hail from the ~~rather tropey Anglo-like nations~~ western coast with resemblances to Renaissance Europe (and a bit of Native America), I should list the four that are most important to their geopolitical region, but I'm going to go with the ones that I believe are the most significant. Keep in mind that I have not fully fleshed out some of the more distant areas of the world. 

**Capital and Technology** - Veridial, the capital of Lacusarane, a lush nation that sprawls across the Five Lakes region, named so because there are five big lakes in that region. The lands are incredibly fertile, crisscrossed with navigable rivers, streams, and lakes, and boasts a rather stable yearly climate. Veridial is smack in the center of the region, along a river that connects two of the lakes to the southern ocean.  Being it is near the center of Runora, it has been the location of many international conferences in its long history. Veridial is incredibly lush, with elegant buildings, several rings of walls, and an intricate canal and sewer system. The city has efficient draining systems, indoor plumbing, outstanding architecture, and a number of other technological quirks that allow it to combat the flood-prone habitat of the Five Lakes region. 

**Economy** - Founded long ago by goatherders turned copper-smiths, Khart is a great city along the shores of the Ánaykar Sea. In its long history, it has felled empires, defended pirates, and served as the connection between the West and East due to its incredible copper deposits and its position along such essential land and sea trade routes. It is run by the Synod of Khart, who has kept the city free from foreign domination for millennia. 

**Weaponry** - Serserea, the capital of the Silluthean Isles, is not only a mind-boggling feat of architecture, scaling the coastal cliffs of the tropical island it sits upon in a nearly impossible way, but is also a center of weaponry achievement in the eastern parts of Runora. It boasts incredible military technology, such as the snake-gliders that can fly over a mile and hold three soldiers, and their naval fleet, which operates much like a snake, with incredible agility and speed. The captains of each ship communicate with lights and crystals, allowing for instant, simultaneous changes in course and direction.

So what they want is to make sure that Whites remain dominant in Western countries in order to preserve Western civilization.

you also imply that because i said a country did something positive, we also have to accept some shitty thing they also do. why not look to the eu in terms of monsanto regulation? harsh pesticide restrictions on bee killers and soy, yet eu is still competitive with its crops (mainly because it doesnt rely on monocultures).

your next point implies that crop rotation is not a thing. milk, butter, eggs are livestock products. cows and chickens dont die with the seasons, they can last over a winter and still provide produce. you can store grass and hay and they will still live. crops also have different harvest periods. food can also be stored. canned goods are virtually spoil free as well. who cares if avocados or asparagus are not available year round because they are constantly grown year round in mexico. if i wanted that, i would move there. wheat also produces great yields in quantities and is very easy to store. you can still have flour in december to april without growing it. but you arent importing it from a third world country, so it's a problem because the money needs to flow there. 

also, famines are not caused by that. [it's always political](http://archive.is/KvcsA). irish potato famine was caused by seizing crops, same with holodomor, same with the indian famines caused by churchill.

https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2017/10/09/batavia-yet-another-trade-finance-blockchain-platform-duh/

Even in their Universal Payments Solution announcement they hint at trade finance. 
As an example, IBM said a farmer in Samoa will soon be able to contract with a buyer in Indonesia, and use the blockchain to record everything from the farmer’s collateral to letters of credit to payment.
“This is the next step in the evolution of blockchain technology. It’s live money moving around a network,” Jesse Lund, IBM’s VP of Blockchain, told Fortune.

Keith Bear,  vice-president of global financial markets at IBM, said this:
IBM’s decision to enter the cryptocurrency space may be of particular interest to the many players already working with the tech company on a range of other blockchain projects.

For example, IBM and seven major European banks – the Digital Trade Chain (DTC) consortium – are soon going live with a blockchain trade finance platform for SMEs. The platform will enable buyers and sellers to agree on their transaction in a smart contract, to follow the physical flow of the goods through a track and trace system and to obtain financing.

IBM is also working with UBS and a number of banks on a similar project under the name Batavia. Both powered by Hyperledger’s Fabric, the platforms focus on the digitsation of processes around trade finance, but they use conventional methods for the payment itself.

According to Bear, the fact that the technology is consistent means that the new payments solution is “well-suited” to integrate with its other projects. As such, we could well see other consortia extend their trade finance platforms to involve payments using cryptocurrencies.

“Whilst the immediate implementation is just focused on payments, the potential is certainly to go into other areas as well. The overall design we are taking is certainly extendible to other asset classes,” Bear says.

“This solution is another example, on top of the what’s happening with DTC and Batavia, to potentially provide a better service to SMEs or corporates using trade finance facilities from their banks. Not only by providing more credit facilities, but in this particular example being able to reduce the cost and time of the payment transactions as well.”

IBM notes in a statement that financial institutions in the future will be able to choose the settlement network of their choice. This could involve the likes of Ripple or bitcoin. The solution will also be able to support the exchange of central bank-issued digital tokens.",True,0,1512165049,,False,0,dqmokum,False,t3_7gy8fw,t3_7gy8fw,/r/Stellar/comments/7gy8fw/ibm_is_currently_creating_a_blockchain_technology/dqmokum/,1514245983,12,False,Stellar,t5_2t9ha,public,

In other words, little pieces of fucking shit. The stereotype of all leftism is that we are those guys, who, for a few decades managed to leverage state influence to rise up through leftwing movements. Of course, now that the Soviets are gone and we know all of the horrible things they did, they are of no consequence, at least in America, the West, and the Asian Democracies. This stereotype is propped up by big business because they do not want you to know what we actually believe.

I am a Democratic Market Socialist. I am represented in game as the Syndie track for the CSA. I want a democratic republic that is similar to the one we have now. A few major reforms, but the principles of governance and the ideas encapsulated in the Bill of Rights would remain the same.

Right now, our economic lives are in a state of tyranny. We are subject to thousands of petty tyrants and dictators in the form of our bosses. They do not listen to us, but to themselves and to shareholders. On a day to day basis, these people govern us much more the actual government does. Why, in the most important part of daily life, should we give up our right to representative governance? Each worker should own the company as a citizen owns the republic, with a share that they use to vote for their managers and bosses, while getting a cut of the profits. This is called a co-op, specifically a worker's co-op. They are many across the world and some are quite large, like [Mondragon,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) which is one of the biggest employers in Spain or the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, one of the richest regions in Europe, where 40% of the GDP is produced by coops, many of them agricultural. These are things that work in the real world and have for decades. They can work side-by-side alongside capitalism and eventually replace it with a better a system, if the government actually supports them instead of propping up undemocratic fiefdoms throughout industry and factory farm racketeering in agriculture.

Compare that to the Tankies and the fuckery that happens when a dictatorship tries to run everything. I am firmly in the American democratic political tradition. I am merely trying to root out the corruption of private tyranny and extend democracy into the workplace.

Well that was the point. What specifically about EU made Trick better that he couldn't get in Korea? The only difference was that Trick wasn't good enough in Korea and EU gave him a chance to prove himself. He was already a good enough player to be signed.

&gt;Thats like claiming Bjergsen literally did not got better when e played in NA because the region is worse and he was the best player in the region for a few years. 

No, that's not what I'm saying. I said Bjergsen was already good BEFORE coming to NA and the region didn't make Bjerg improve he was already good. 

&gt;Also you can't tell me that Mr ""Gameover"" and Huni did not got better when they played in Fnatic and reached semifinals at worlds.

What do you mean by good? Good in EU or good in LCK? When they went against Korean teams what happened? Smeb destroyed Huni and RO was basically a non factor.

FinestCarpetCompany,,,"- Random acts of violence like that occur everywhere.  But I do recognize that Western governments/media are more inviting of foreigners and will focus/call out such acts of violence more so than in Poland.  That is why I stated relative to the rest of the World, which is more like Poland in this regard.  For example when people debate quality of life in Japan, they don't discuss how minorities are treated.  But in Western Civilization it is.  Like how people will criticize 1950's USA (arguably one of the highest living standards in recent history) because it wasn't inclusive to minorities.  But that demographic made up &lt;10% of the population.  Why judge an entire decade and society based on such a tiny population.

- Agreed.  I think the current government is hesitant to do it because then Western media will react with ""see, we warned you that your country has serious problem with this and you allowed or even encouraged it"".  We saw this recently play out when the Polish government condemned some extremist at the Independence rally and people on the left used it as ammo against Poland.  (Not calling out leftist for doing this, both sides engage in this political game).

- Well there is a huge gap between being the or even one of the most tolerant nations in Europe - and - accepting 2K or even 10K refugees.  I don't think it is in our best interest to get into a rat race with the West over such tolerance.  They are kind of a runaway train with no brakes in that regard.  It will continue to be difficult for people to sell diversity to Poland as violence in Western Europe increases :: bomb found at Christmas Market @ Potsdam today.  My sister lives in neighboring Berlin.  In the past I was a little irked when she didn't attend Christmas/Easter events in public but considering what has been occurring, I can't blame her.  Based on recent history the mass influx of refugees/migrants from that part of the World will be the next wave of ""disenfranchised 2nd generation migrant"", which most of the recent terrorist attackers were.  I don't think the crisis is over, it is just reaching the next stage, such as arguing over family reunification.  Furthermore even the best case scenario of these people integrating into European society: it will still rise the level of crime.  Or more precisely the median/standard will be lowered.  That is the whole irony of equality.  You are combining two uneven parts which results in a shared middle ground.  That middle ground will be lower than the previous European standard.  And this transcends everything from crime, to education, to social norms.  So we are openly selling out our values and even heritage &amp; traditions for economic profit (which is still debatable).  Rather disgusting if you ask me.

From what I have read and been told, treatment of Middle Easteners specifically change after the Crisis.  This was stated by immigrants and asylum seekers that came to Poland 3+ years ago.  So some of this is cause and effect.  If the tolerant West (EU/NATO) wasn't making these enormous blunders, then Poles wouldn't feel backed into a corner.",True,0,1512165712,,1512166252,0,dqmp83p,False,t3_7glh1d,t1_dqlrn5f,/r/poland/comments/7glh1d/what_do_you_think_of_polands_new_relevance_and/dqmp83p/,1514246339,0,False,poland,t5_2qkmn,public,

Another thing I keep saying is that you can’t compare what happens in one European country with what happens in the USA.  The fact that our federal government was created by the states to serve *them* escapes those living in smaller countries all the time.  But here a large segment of the population that lives in small states do not trust the federal government and when someone in government proposes something like net neutrality they will push back against it.

Meanwhile in Washington and the large media markets you get the “what’s wrong with these people” attitude, because they feel that they don’t have to explain themselves:  “it’s net neutrality, what do you mean that you don’t want it?”.  If it’s so good, why not propose a bill in congress and let’s debate it?

Back in the day in Europe two nations get into a dispute, they fight a war until one side gives in or runs out of money (they ran out of money in Europe a lot) and then they have a treaty.

See the 11 Dano-Swedish wars between 1521 and 1814. The 38 Wars/Conflicts involving Austria from 1526 - 1900, the 7 wars between France and Prussia/Germany from 1701 to 1871, or the 96ish different conflicts the UK was involved in from 1700-1900.

This was the norm as a lot of these (like the UK) were tiny, small, colonial ""wars"" and not the big Napoleon scale stuff most people think of. 

Now today Russia and the US can never fight a real ""war"" as it would end in WWIII as any armed conflict between US and Russian troops would most likely escalate. So instead we ""fight"" in different ways that back in 1880 would have started a war. Spying, cyber/internet manipulations, etc.

TLDR: back in the day countries were like people fighting with fists, so they fought often and quick. Nations were often bloodied but rarely killed. Now the US, Russia, China, etc. now they are like people sitting on 500 lb bombs, carrying two 50 cal machine guns. Yeah they might throw insults, and even a slap on the back of the head that they then deny but no one dares to throw a punch because of what it could easily lead to.

Dkvn,,,"&gt;How can I best make money?

Really depends wich country you are playing. Normally, early game you will be making most of your money from tax, but if you are playing something like Venice you will get also a lot of money from trade, and if you are playing Sweden you will get a lot of money from production. Normally, early game tax, mid game trade, and late game production. 

&gt;Does having more trade power get you more ducats?

Normally, yeah.

&gt;Who are some fun countries to play as?

For semone new, play Portugal, Castille or the Ottomans.

&gt;Why the Ottomans called Kebab?

Turkish people have been imigrating into Europe for the last decades, they have bringed some food origanarie from their land called ""kebab"", it is joke to call them kebab as you can often find turks around Europe selling kebab on the streets. 

&gt;What is the best way to colonize?

Not sure what you mean, just pick exploration ideas and expasion

&gt;Is playing as a country in the New World fun or do you just get crushed by Old World countries with better tech?

Yes, countrys in the new world are very weak compared to european countrys, and if you are new you will get crushed.

WaltzRoommate,unidentified,Alt Right,"&gt; There you go again. All in-group preference is well established. You haven't shown any evidence of being in my in group other than being white. That's really weak evidence of being in my in group.

My entire argument is that racial in-grouping is important.

&gt; Because the only reason you think you are in their in group is that you are both white. That's the shakiest foundation for an in group you can come up with.

Blood is not a weak foundation. You say that you care about your child, what makes you prefer him and want to fight for him than your neighbor's child? It's blood, right? Not a weak  bond at all. When push  comes to shove, who can your son rely on most, you or someone with less of his blood?

&gt; Cultural diversity, not racial. You keep mixing those two up.

No I'm not. Cultural diversity doesn't really cause issues. [Putnam proved the issues with racial diversity and social  cohesion.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x/pdf) 

[In a meta-analysis in 2014](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309), the studies that had problems replicating Putnam's work were ones that tested for ethnic rather than racial diversity, meaning that a half-british half-black neighborhood would be counted equally diverse as a half-british and half-german neighborhood. The worst of these studies actually controlled for racial diversity but often still reached fashy conclusions. For instance, [this one](http://web5.uottawa.ca/www5/pendakur/pdf%20docs/Ethnicity%20and%20Social%20Capital%20in%20Canada%20CES.pdf) and [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562410000648) each concluded that diversity doesn't affect social trust (again, controlling for race) but concluded that the amount of nonwhites in a neighborhood correlated negatively with social trust. Although, I'd rather not read into those two much because a bad study is bad even if we might glean fashy conclusions from it. 


Culture isn't all that important compared to race and we see a textbook example of this in America. All sorts of different white ethnicities have blended together pretty well, but we don't get the same effect from different races - even ones that were never mistreated by whites. Culture is only really useful as a proxy for race. You don't get fired from your job for defending ""Western culture.""

&gt; Because that means removing this whole bunch of other people we could trade with and sell stuff to. Which is economically stupid

And yet, we became the most powerful and rich nation is the world when 90% white, even though that meant overcoming the other superpowers, who were also homogeneous both in Europe and Asia. 

&gt; You do realize that our entire economic system is set up to not put any group's interests first (other than rich people)?

Oh man, I'm going to get very banned if I jump on this one. I'm sorry but I've gotta pass. Let's drop this one. You're welcome to ask on debatealtright though, a sub which I mod.

&gt; Get rid of all the non whites and all you do is have a monoracial bunch of people who don't care about me economically.

So, you're saying only nonwhites care about you economically? What's your argument for this?

&gt; Its statistically improbable for me to care about my friends, my wife, my hobbies? 

It's statistically improbable for you to even have nonwhite friends, especially if you have more than 9% of your friend group being nonwhite. It's also statistically improbable for you to have a nonwhite wife and if you do, you're more likely to get divorced. If you have all these things, you might just be  a very statistically improbable person. It is important to recognize your statistical improbability though and recognize why the statistically probable people might have different views.

I think you are trying to view the world through an American racial lens.
 Are you saying that non-Whites in America will go all holocaust on white people? Jews in Germany barely made up 1% of the German population in 1933. While they were dominant in business and academic, they were far from being dominant

""See the chinese in Vietnam
See the chinese in Malaysia
See the Jews in Germany
See the whites in South Africa
See the whites in Zimbabwe
See the Rwanda Genocide""

First off how did the whites in South Africa and Zimbabwe get to their position, was it through solely hard work, and not at all by force of arms or enslavement?  Were the Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda really driven by one set of people being superior or more productive? Tell me.

As for the Chinese in Malaysia were brought over by the British. They never had political power, no one did at Malays' independence.  The British when they helped draft the Constitution with the 3 races, made sure that the Malays would be the dominant political force in Malay but ensuring the special status within the Constitution for Malays and Islam.  The riots of 1969 just hastened what was inevitable, but very few Chinese Malaysians actually fled as a result of 1969.  Say what you may of the Malays in Malaysian, but even many Chinese Malaysians said they did a reasonable job of running the country, far better than the Thais in Thailand despite integrating their Chinese population into the political structure in Thailand. As for Chinese in Vietnam, they made up about 10-15% of the boat people, the rest were ethnic Vietnamese, you know all those South Vietnamese officers, South Vietnam government officials. The Chinese were persecuted initially less because they were Chinese, but more because they were capitalist.  North Vietnam was a Communist did you not know that?

Let me blunt with you, you can scrape affirmative action tomorrow, and it won't improve America's scientific performance. White people don't get a graduate degree in engineering, not because it the position was taken by a black person, but because graduate degrees in the sciences is hard work and there the payoff in getting a graduate degree in the hard science and engineering is low.

The majority of graduate degrees in the hard sciences and engineering go to non-Americans from the developing world (ie China and India)

http://college.usatoday.com/2015/07/08/international-students-stem-degrees/

Is affirmative action stopping a white person from getting a PhD in Physics? Its not, only people who are ignorant would believe that. But of course people like you believe that nonsense, and in spite, make it harder for those people who get their PhD from US universities to get permanent residency because they aren't white, thus making it even hard for the US to catch up to China.

Secondly, I think the biggest problem in academics as it pertains to getting people into sciences is how people in non-coastal states (red states) aren't adequately represented in the Ivy League, and has less to do with affirmative action, and more to do with admissions in the Ivy League. Jews are disproportionately dominant in the Ivy League, and it hurts white Gentiles the most

http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/

Affirmative action for blacks/Latinos isn't as important for US scientific, performance because whites that lose out to them are most likely aren't going to be gunning for Noble Prize in Physics anytime soon. The type of discrimination at Ivies is far more complicated and damaging.

As for US decline since the 1960s was expected.  First off the US benefited greatly from an influx of European researchers after WW2 and the US economy was the only major economy standing after WW2. This only hastened after the  Cold War.  The US prior to 1940 wasn't actually a leader in scientific research.

Lastly, you see the world divided into racial/civilizational camps with each camp willing to nuke the other at a drop of a hat.  Come on, give me a break. That post just reconfirms your biases.

I can Google Muslim population statistics too, here the part you seem to be leaving out: where do most of the Muslims who immigrate/seek asylum in the U.S. and Europe come from? Because when the discussion of Muslims entering these countries in the west pops up, it’s almost always focused on the middle-Eastern and north African variety. So to feign like racists in the U.S. and Europe totally are thinking of those other Muslims not currently entering this part of the world is extremely dishonest on the part of those people who try to defend Islamaphobia and racism.

QWieke,,,"&gt; All of those examples are of groups that lost to superior states.

Arguably not:

&gt; The inclusivity of the Seminole demonstrates how indigenous Americans viewed tribe and nation as matters of voluntary association and acceptance within a community, rather than the restrictive ethnic/hereditary categories they are assumed to be in Western civilization. The Seminole call themselves the “unconquered people” because they never signed a peace treaty with the colonizers. They survived a series of wars waged against them by the United States and managed to kill 1,500 US soldiers and an unknown number of militiamen. During the Second Seminole War, from 1835 to 1842, the one thousand Seminole warriors in the Everglades employed guerrilla tactics to devastating effect, even though they faced 9,000 professional, well-equipped soldiers. The war cost the US government $20 million, a huge sum at the time. By the end of the war, the US government had managed to force most of the Seminole into exile in Oklahoma, but gave up on conquering the remaining group, who never surrendered and continued to live free of government control for decades. 

#

&gt; The Mapuche are a large indigenous group living on land now occupied by the states of Chile and Argentina. Traditionally they made decisions with consensus and a minimum of hierarchy. Lacking any kind of state apparatus did not prevent them from defending themselves. Before the European invasion, they successfully defended themselves from their hierarchical neighbors, the Inca, who were, by European standards, far more advanced. During the Spanish conquest, the Inca fell quickly, but the Mapuche lands became known as the “Spanish Cemetery.” After the Mapuche defeated the conquistadors in a series of wars spanning a hundred years, Spain signed the treaty of Killin, admitting its failure to conquer the Mapuche and recognizing them as a sovereign nation. Mapuche sovereignty was further recognized in 28 subsequent treaties. 

#

&gt; From 1860–65, the Mapuche were invaded and “pacified” by the Chilean and Argentinian states, a genocide that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The invaders began a process of suppressing the Mapuche language and Christianizing the conquered people. But Mapuche resistance continues, and thanks to this a number of Mapuche communities still enjoy a relative degree of autonomy. Their resistance remains a threat to the security of the Chilean state; as of this writing, several Mapuche are imprisoned under Pinochet-era anti-terrorism laws for attacks against forestry plantations and copper mines that were destroying the land.

And the bit you seem to be overlooking is the size disparity between the warring factions. These are all examples of peoples successfully resisting overwhelming outside force for a limited amount of time, making the aggressor pay dearly. And guess what? Any force being met by a overwhelmingly large force is going to lose, this has jack shit to do with the way the societies are organized. Which is why most, if not all, socialists/anarchists/communists argue that the revolution has to be a global effort, so the capitalist class will be too busy dealing with the working class in their own country to be able to squash a revolution in a different country.

Lord_TheJc,lombardia,Lombardia,"Tl;Dr: conservare i dati non è illegale, ma l'ultima direttiva europea è nulla in quanto lo fa per tempi troppo lunghi secondo la corte. Ma non cambia niente circa le singole leggi nazionali.

--------------------------

Dunque, non so che tipo di conoscenze giuridiche tu abbia, quindi nel dubbio farò il giro lungo.

Quello che la corte di giustizia europea ha fatto è di dichiarare nulla una direttiva europea circa la conservazione dei dati.

La direttiva europea però non è una ""legge europea"" intesa come una legge comune valida in tutti gli stati.

La direttiva è un indicazione ad integrare/modificare il proprio diritto nazionale al fine di conformarsi alle istruzioni della direttiva.

Infatti si parla di ""ricezione della direttiva"" quando si legifera per integrare la direttiva nel diritto nazionale.

Questo vuol dire che ogni stato avrà quindi una sua legge nazionale diversa (seppur di poco) da quelle degli altri stati.

L'europa poi può anche arrivare a multare chi non si adatta alle direttive, torneremo su questo punto dopo.

Torniamo all'inizio: la corte di giustizia europea che dichiara nulla la direttiva.

Questo porta al cancellare la direttiva, e quindi alla perdita da parte dell'europa del potere di sanzionare chi non si adegua.

Questo però non porta al decadimento delle normative nazionali, ma ovviamente se qualcuno volesse fare ricorso ci sarebbe già un ""precedente"" su cui poter far leva. 

La corte di giustizia europea NON ha affatto detto che tenere i dati è illegale, ha anzi detto che la conservazione dei dati ""soddisfa gli obiettivi di interesse generale della pubblica sicurezza"", ma ha rigettato la direttiva europea perchè secondo loro non limitava la conservazione dei dati allo stretto necessario.

E ti dirò di più: direttiva europea o no noi in italia (così come penso tutti) avevamo già la nostra legge sulla conservazione dei dati. Le direttive europee (sia quella del 2006 annullata dalla corte, che quella del 2002) sono servite al massimo a raffinare quello che c'era già.

Di nuovo: conservare i dati non è illegale, ma va fatto solo per il tempo necessario.

Se qualcuno facesse ricorso probabilmente (sicuramente) verrebbe dichiarata illegale la nostra conservazione per 6 anni, ma torneremmo alla normativa precedente.",True,0,1512170495,,False,0,dqmtk2k,False,t3_7gxdnf,t1_dqmrbdo,/r/italy/comments/7gxdnf/domodossola_telecamere_incastrano_ragazza_che_fa/dqmtk2k/,1514248783,1,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

LiberalsAintLeftists,,Marxist-Leninist (PSL),"If you're arguing that we can vote in socialism, most would indeed consider that idealistic. As Lenin describes in *The State and Revolution*, ""the State is a special organisation of force: it is an organisation of violence for the suppression of some class."" In other words, the primary purpose of the state is to maintain the dominance of one class over another; all a state's legal mechanisms are designed with this in mind. In the US and Europe, states have a bourgeois/capitalist class character, and it's unrealistic to expect to be able to harness the state machinery designed to uphold capitalism in order to *destroy* capitalism. ""The master's tools will never bring down the master's house,"" etc etc. 

In some unique historical conditions, it may be *possible* to somewhat dismantle a capitalist structure through the ballot box, but these movements also run into problems because the socialist leadership is advancing too fast, when the class consciousness of the masses is not yet prepared for full revolution. Venezuela is currently in the midst of this (noble) struggle, and is experiencing the inherent difficulties in this approach. Still, Marxist-Leninism holds that parliamentary participation is not a universally viable recipe for revolution.

If, however, you're arguing that Marxist parties could engage in bourgeois elections as part of outreach efforts, I agree with you. My party, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, runs candidates for this purpose. We have no expectation that electoral participation will overthrow capitalism, but the recent campaigns of Gloria La Riva, Dennis Banks, and Eugene Puryear were a great way to meet potential supporters nationally, and drew many into the party. Running candidates can indeed be effective for outreach in that case.

If you'd like to read some of the essential theory behind these ideas, I'd highly recommend you try Lenin's [*The State and Revolution*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/), which is probably the closest thing to foundational text Marxism-Leninism has.",True,0,1512171068,,False,0,dqmu1qv,False,t3_7gqbbf,t1_dqmnfgu,/r/communism101/comments/7gqbbf/how_many_of_you_are_from_working_class_backgrounds/dqmu1qv/,1514249073,2,False,communism101,t5_2uc81,public,

The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea or Periplus of the Red Sea (Greek: Περίπλους τῆς Ἐρυθράς Θαλάσσης, Latin: Periplus Maris Erythraei) is a Greco-Roman periplus, written in Greek, describing navigation and trading opportunities from Roman Egyptian ports like Berenice along the coast of the Red Sea, and others along Northeast Africa and the Sindh and South western India. The text has been ascribed to different dates between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE, but a mid-1st-century date is now the most commonly accepted. While the author is unknown, it is clearly a firsthand description by someone familiar with the area and is nearly unique in providing accurate insights into what the ancient European world knew about the lands around the Indian Ocean.

The Erythraean Sea, or in modern spelling, Eritrean Sea (Greek: Ἐρυθρά Θάλασσα) is presently a Greek name for the Red Sea; to the ancient Greeks it included the Indian Ocean in its entirety and the Persian Gulf.

I was playing as Germany, and I wanted to avoid war with France and the UK as I was getting ready to focus on the Comintern w/ Japan.

Italy and Bulgaria joined as well, But the United Kingdom was also in the war on the same side as the Soviets. And then when the USSR Declared war on me, against my will it made all my allies join the war, which then resulted in the Soviet-German War getting merged with the Hungarian-Romanian war, which then made me at war with all of the allies (except france as it separately declared war on romania to puppet it, making the ussr at war with it aswell)
In the end, I beat the soviets as one mod made training time twice as long for the soviets during the purge, and the war with UK made it never end, as there were no valid conditions for one of us to offer peace. They kept beating my navy and Air force, but they couldn't invade europe.

Auckland345,,,"&gt; Overturning the decision would mean we are not living in a democracy

That is a common misunderstanding of democracy. Democracy is an on going process and as such you have the right to advocate a view even if they have recently voted on it. It is not like the opposition shuts up for another 5 years until the next election but that they can advocate why they would make a better government than the people, who are currently in power. As such it is reasonable for people to advocate for remaining in the EU, just like any other position. Indeed people who wanted to leave the EU didn't shut up because of the result in 1975 and I can not imagine that they would have just accepted it if the result had gone the other way. Indeed Nigel Farage said himself that in a 52/48 referendum wouldn't be unfinished business. So why is it the other side who are expected to shut up when even dare to criticize the current path, let alone advocating staying in? 

Also referendums aren't particularly democratic, as they are pretty easy to manipulate and are often times not called for the best of reasons. They are also a popular way for dictators to legitimize their power. There is a good reason why most countries are representative democracies and even somewhere like Switzerland, tend to use them for pretty minor things.",True,0,1512173815,,False,0,dqmwbpk,False,t3_7gyszo,t1_dqmvgft,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/7gyszo/is_there_a_way_we_can_stop_brexit/dqmwbpk/,1514250355,14,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,public,
jcopta,,,"&gt; Yes, but the fight, in the end, is not to protect consumer products but to protect the general flow of information. What stops an ISP from blocking news and public information that is damaging to their agenda?

ISPs are in bad position to that... but information data keepers are.. and they have done it. Between EU right to be forgotten legislation that mandates Google to removes some pages, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube bias.

Just on Google:

*  https://gizmodo.com/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesn-t-li-1798646437
*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google

&gt; What competition? A duopoly is not competition, which most people face. It is a stagnant market that only a handful of companies control.

According to stats pretty much everyone has access to at least 3 ISPs, the duopoly isn't that common.

&gt; They have massive control. They use packet sniffing to know what you are doing on the internet. They have throttled users and services in the past with impunity until the FCC went after them. I think you are drastically underestimating the control these companies have. The changes will come slowly, but they will come. Without regulation, the major ISP's will start to block, throttle, and interfere with any traffic on their networks that they feel like. They will use those tactics to block competition of their other services, monetize everything possible, and worryingly block information that does not align with their political goals.

That will only work if customers don't care enough to change of ISP or cancel their contract. Regarding political views, again, content creators are already doing that and they can do it so much better than ISPs.

Facebook can check people's content, the ISP only a connection to Facebook. I think you're worrying about nothing but I understand your concern about that.

thegiantkiller,Windrunner,Windrunner,"&gt; Legal is not moral.

Sure, but, again, you're attributing *modern* morality to something set in a wildly different culture. Morality evolves and can vary from culture to culture *today.* I'm not saying I disagree with you, necessarily; just that you're not viewing things in context. I'd argue that more ancient forms of slavery (which were really closer indentured servants) is far more moral than the current practice of loading kids up with loans to pay for school that will follow them until they die or they pay (one of the few forms of debt that can never be wiped out by bankruptcy). 

&gt; I wonder how Kaladin would respond...

Gonna stop you right there; human slaves in Stormlight and Parshmen are two completely different conversations. Neither were treated right, but Kal wasn't treated like a Parshman, for better and worse (Parshmen were more valuable, so you didn't whip them; humans are sentient and you know it so you don't tear slave families apart [that we know of]). I agree with his assessment once he's met them, but as other posters have said, pre Everstorm, they needed to be told what to do. They didn't even know they *could* be sentient until they met the Listeners, and even then they didn't know they were the same species. Apples and oranges. I won't hold someone accountable for something they had no way of knowing.

&gt;European history

I don't have the timeline memorized, but I was thinking 2000 years ago was about when they captured the Unmade and ripped Identity and Connectivity from the Parshmen; so, right about the Roman empire (ish). I'm pretty sure it was common back then in most places; Africa and the aforementioned empire, at least, off the top of my head (although, again, it was closer to indentured servants; not 100% apples to apples). I'll acknowledge that it's not necessary and that the Rosharians could have done better, but journeys have to start somewhere.

&gt; ... Use them as opposed to destroying them.

I'm waiting for the other shoe. I don't trust him at his word, and I don't know enough about the Oathpact to say whether he needs at least most of humanity dead in order to leave, which is his goal. But if it was just getting someone to say ""uncle"", 90% of the population dead would probably have done it. 

&gt; Nothing of the sort happened in WW2...

Allow me to be more specific; if the Listeners are the Germans, the humans are the Allies (with probably Mr. T as Stalin), Odium is Hitler, and the Fused are the SS, I hope that our heroes do what the Allies did for the German people: Hitler self destructed, the SS were tried for their crimes, but regular German soldiers were treated with mercy rather than what happened after WW1 (it's your fault, you owe us X).

WaltzRoommate,unidentified,Alt Right,"&gt; But why skin colour?

Saying that race is about skin color is like saying that what's special about your brother is that you have the same chin as you. Your race is your largest extended family. Every member of your race is more similar to you than any member of any other race and that has enormous ramifications for group identity, social cohesion, and trust. 

&gt; Religion, culture, language or actual familial ties

All of these things are racial correlates. 

Obviously ethnoreligions like judaism don't even require explanation, but even Christianity, which seeks converts, is overwhelmingly racialized. Since churches are one of the few areas that the government can't regulate, people tend to self segregate and the vast majority of churches are either entirely one race or overwhelmingly one race. And as churches become more progressive, whites are attending them less and less.

Same goes for culture. As a white person, my cultural ties are significantly closer to European nations, especially Britain, than to anything hip-hop related. 

And as for family ties, race-mixing is pretty rare, especially among whites. Race and family are the same thing, except for race is a more extended family. Race mixing is rare enough that it doesn't seriously challenge that, and since mixed race couples have a higher chance of divorce, it's pretty likely that they might even prove the rule. 

&gt; Also the cost of dividing society seems quite high. 

[Not as high as the cost of being multicultural.](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/05/11/fiscal-impact-of-whites-blacks-and-hispanics/) That's not to say that no individual blacks or Hispanics make positive contributions, and I specifically and adequately acknowledge diversity within groups. But in terms of averages spread out across large groups, it's not an even distribution across races.

&gt; Split families, broken friendships, lost social capital, increased racial tensions due to unfamiliarit
y, a more genetically isolated and vulnerable population, etc.

Most families are not interracial and a lot of the interracial ones tend to pick one side. 

[Very few whites have nonwhite friends. 75% of white Americans do not have a single nonwhite friend and across the population, 91% of friends of white people are white themselves.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/?utm_term=.cdd721e78698)

I don't know what you mean by ""lost social capital.""  

I've also never actually seen any evidence that unfamiliarity increases racial tensions. Vermont is probably one of the least racist states and it's 97% white. I'm down in diverse Florida and it's racist as hell. Even in states like California that are diverse overall, the individual neighborhoods are not. Also, when different neighborhoods become diverse, [they report much lower social trust.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x/pdf) People watch more TV, have fewer friends, trust their neighbors less, don't give to charity, etc.  

Moreover, even racists seem to be okay with groups they've never met. The alt right has enormous respect for the Japanese people despite that few of us have spent much time there. Even Asians in America, we don't normally interact with them or want to live with them but we respect them.

I'm not really sure what you mean by ""genetically isolated and vulnerable.""

&gt; European Council President Donald Tusk has said that if the UK offer on the border on the island of Ireland is unacceptable for Ireland, then it will also be unacceptable for the EU. Mr Tusk made the comments after meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin.

&gt; He insisted there could be no division between the other EU member states and Ireland: &amp;quot;The EU is fully behind you and your request that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; He said Ireland wanted to achieve &amp;quot;An agreed wording whereby we can agree the parameters within which we can find a solution that prevents the re-emergence of a border on the island of Ireland&amp;quot; before a 14 December EU summit.

&gt; + Maduro deve ser julgado pelo TPI, pede Human Rights Watch “Nos últimos quatro meses, 24 pacientes diabéticos morreram em razão da falta de insulina e amputamos cinco pessoas em um mês”. “Alguns tipos de insulina até chegam às farmácias particulares, mas custam muito caro”, disse Monica ao jornal La Verdade de Vargas. “No hospital, não temos como tratar os pacientes e estamos fazendo vaquinha para comprar alguns produtos básicos.” Diante da escassez de remédios, a OMS admitiu ontem que há uma crise humanitária no país. Segundo um estudo da ONG Cáritas da Venezuela, vinculada à Igreja Católica, 35,5% das crianças pobres do país, com idade de 0 a 5 anos, estão desnutridas. + Chavismo anuncia que Maduro disputará a reeleição em 2018 Para os médicos, a escassez de métodos contraceptivos é a causa do aumento de casos de aids e de outras doenças sexualmente transmissíveis (DSTs), como gonorreia, sífilis e herpes. A ginecologista do Hospital Universitário de Caracas, Vanessa Diaz, afirmou ao jornal Washington Post que o número de pacientes com outras DSTs também aumentou. + Linha aérea venezuelana é proibida de voar para a UE Mesmo tendo as maiores reservas de petróleo do mundo, em várias regiões a gasolina está no fim.

What? The UK has been a leading net contributor even with its rebate (it wouldn't have had much chance to negotiate it if the figures weren't on its side) and the decision that drove it to Leave (inability to halt migration from within the EU) it opted into for years when nearly everyone else didn't and as such taken the brunt of those migrants.

It wasn't blackmail, either - much like FN in France, Cameron seen UKIP breathing down his neck and tried to shoot their fox - hoping to win the sort of concession that allowed all of those countries to forgo the newly-joined Eastern European migrants for the best part of a decade.

zzzztopportal,mixed,Social Liberal/Neoliberal,"Okay, this requires a long response:

1.  The study showed that the U. S. is an oligarchy in the sense that it enacted policies supported by the wealthy at a significantly higher rate than those supported by the poor.  However, it didn't show any of the following things:


1.  This was because of the inherent influence of the wealthy on politics, not the inability of low income Americans to vote

2.  It didn't show that the U. S. was an oligarchy in the sense that the wealthy have de facto legal control over the poor.  The policies that the wealthy favored are generally not ""make the poor people peasants for us,"" but rather ""lower my taxes.""  Both are a bad idea, but to call the latter an oligarchy is a bit of a stretch.

3.  Even given 1 and 2, it's not like wealthy people ENTIRELY control the government, as the study showed that poorer individuals often did get legislation through

4.  The study was done up until 2001, a time when the right controlled politics.  Since the election of Obama, the left has been on the rise.  Trump is an odd case, because the majority of wealthy voters actually did not vote for him (he won amongst the middle class)

While I agree that those results are troubling, they do not imply tthat the  U. S. is an oligarchy in the traditional sense

As for your second point:

1.  You fail to point to examples.  I'll give you that the Iran war was a mistake, but the idea that we have literally infinite wars is fake.  We have plenty of military bases in Europe, but no harm is being done.  In fact, the biggest problem with said bases is probably money loss.  In terms of the wars we actually have, a significant percentage fall under the category of ""paused"" wars with low death counts, or justified wars (i. e. against north korea).

2.  EVEN IF all of those wars are wars of aggression, their death toll on the global scale is negligible compared to (for example), the worldwide death toll of malaria.  The United States has major issues, but my point is that the world as a whole is benefiting from industrial capitalism.  Furthermore, capitalism =/= imperialism.  The two often go hand in hand, but most capitalist countries today are not imperialist (only arguably the U. S., and that is a  stretch), and the USSR was hugely imperialistic.",True,0,1512178410,,False,0,dqmzx6i,False,t3_7fzizs,t1_dqmvlbp,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/7fzizs/people_who_hate_centrists_why_do_you_hate/dqmzx6i/,1514252463,1,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,public,

YouShallKnow,,,"&gt;Please read the link I supplied earlier it will tell you how wrong you are about the Swedish government system historically.

HA!  I'm wrong about Sweden historically?  What's one actual fact I'm wrong about? You said Sweden had a democracy in 1776, they didn't. They had an absolute monarchy and the Assembly of Estates that preceded it was absolutely not democratic (although they were slightly more democratic than traditional assemblies in other parts of Europe, with their 25 votes out of 125 for land owning ""peasants""). 

You then said that Sweden got universal suffrage in 1909,not true, it wasn't until 1921 and the US did it in 1920, not 1966 with a totally different law was passed about civil rights. 

You've been wrong up and down. The fact that you're not embarrassed should make you reconsider your life choices; you're obviously able to delude yourself massively. 

&gt; You also seems to be ill equipped to understand when I’m talking about Sweden and US.

You keep drawing stupid parallels between them,like land-owning peasants in the US able to vote is the same as having the Assembly dominated by Nobility; even though your own government at the time drew sharp distinctions between land-owning peasants and nobility. And  even though the nobility directly controlled the government and land-owning citizens in the US just had the right to vote in elections for the legislature and president.   

You confuse the two because you're trying to blur the lines to ""score"" points for Sweden even though you were 90 years behind our political advancement.  It's not your fault man, you had thousands of years of bullshit hereditary rulers that you had to deal with; I mean so did we, but we just made that shit illegal and defeated the kings army militarily.  I guess you should kinda feel bad for that; if you regard yourself as a self-reliant man.  There's only one George Washington and he wasn't Swedish. That's not your fault man. 

&gt;And if you talk about women’s right to vote I clearly stated that before. But as you seems to be stubborn and unable to read I drop the ball her it’s no point in measuring sizes online. Have a nice evening

[deleted],,,"The Paris Climate accords were non-binding, they had no authority to them to actually change anything. They were a gentlemen's agreement between Western nations to limit carbon output in hopes the third world would emulate us, which they haven't. This essentilly frees us to start producing again, which is good for the environment because a factory in the US has a lot more environmental regulations than a factory in China would.

The only Superpower without universal healthcare, well we have put $680 billion into NATO since it's inception. Just so all those nice Europeans can thumb their noses at us while they spend less than 1% on their own self defense.

Capitalism will bring the green revolution because it's what people want. I can't find it, but by 2050 there should be enough fuel cell cars in America that it will offset all other carbon production to essentially give us 0 carbon foot print. All without the Paris climate accords, BMW, Shell, and some giant American mining company are partnering to work on it. There are other conglomerations going on because Big Oil knows the gravy train is ending so they are branching out to Nissan said they will work on combustion engines so we finally get 40-50 mpg cars, that will have a great impact

You have not linked anything, your health care argument is bubkis because it doesn't work, it needed funds diverted from Fanny and Freddy Mae to support it. We can see it doesn't work, in real life right now. Do you live on your own? I got a letter earlier this year saying premiums were going up 10% with up to 20 at the companies discretion. Without interstate competition there is nothing to allow the market to self correct. It benefits people in poor states to be able to buy cheaper but better insurance from the next state over which has a larger infrastructure already in place, which the poor state can not compete with. Then that larger companies market grows to accommodate the new clients, it basic economics again with this school teacher shit.

mithikx,,,"The US will probably send damn near the entire US Pacific Fleet barreling towards the Korean Peninsula. South Korea and or Japan will talk to the US (and maybe defer to the US), the US will call Beijing and Russia to gauge their intent.       

If it's a North Korean attack it'll be Japan or South Korea, either case the US is treaty bound to respond. The US would want to make sure how many fronts it will be fighting on so if there will be Chinese or Russian intervention they'll probably head to the tables unless the attack was something ""unforgivable"" e.g. CBRN (chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear) in which case the attacked side will have the definitive moral high ground and hold popular support within reason.        

Neither Russia nor China (especially China) would want to go to war with the US, certainly not over North Korea. North Korea is a useful buffer but not useful enough to go to a convention war over. If they can snuff out Kim Jong-un and replace the head of state with one of their own puppets they would. North Korea is intentionally kept as a backwater nation, it's why they don't receive any meaningful military aid and why their nuclear and ICBM programs are alarming because it gives North Korea some form of leverage.         

The most likely target would be something in South Korea due to the limits of North Korea's military equipment. North Korea cannot sustain any attack on Japan yet alone Europe (though if they did the US would still intervene anyway I'd wager), the North Korean navy is hardly capable of anything and their air force can only be considered marginally better. Meanwhile both South Korea, Japan and Europe are of equivalent levels in terms of military technology which means they're among the best, while it would be optimistic to say North Korean's are decades behind.       

With those disadvantages a ground attack or a combined attack over the DMZ would be the most effective attack North Korea can muster in terms of doing damage. And going with that assumption the avenue of attack would start with a combination of artillery and missiles followed by a ground invasion. North Korea has a bunch of armored vehicles (e.g. tanks) and would play to their strengths. On a 1:1 basis North Korea falls behind in every conceivable way, the only thing they have going for them are numbers and the chance that they'll use CBRN weapons and that they ""hold South Korea hostage"" by having countless artillery within range of major South Korean cities.      

The following presumes a full scale attack and invasion.     
So North Korea softens up their target (South Korea) before sending in their troops, South Korea sends everything they can muster towards the DMZ to thwart off the invasion and repel them back behind the DMZ along with US troops stationed in the area. South Korea would also activate their reserves which numbers something like 4 million as South Korea has mandatory military service. Koreans living abroad who once served may even voluntarily return to South Korea to re-enlist if the conflict escalates.          

[ROK-US OPLAN 5027](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPLAN_5027) will be enacted by South Korea and the US.    

In all likelihood the situation at this point will escalate, once possible a massive counter attack to neutralize any artillery, missile batteries/silos and etc. will ensue and may involve incursion in to North Korean airspace. At which point coalition aircraft will encounter North Korean SAMs and MANPAADs.       

And while this is happening talks will initiate between the related parties, other nearby nations in East and South East Asia including Japan, Australia and New Zealand will determine if they're neutral, will only provide aid or directly intervene. In all likelihood North Korea would be considered a rouge state, China would probably push for toppling the North Korean government themselves and having a new ""elected"" government take it's place, failing that they could invade North Korea from their boarder to claim as much of it as they can and having that be the new North Korea when all is said and done essentially moving the DMZ north and having a figurehead Beijing can control (for now), or they wipe their hands of the situation and let the South Koreans and Americans bleed to clean up their mess. I don't know what Russia will do, but undoubtedly they would rather not have a staunch US ally right on their border.      

The biggest question might just be how will China and Russia react. They may move to protect their interest while the conflict is on going or jump in right as it nears it's closure. China for example could grab enough of North Korea as a buffer zone and setup a ""DPRK in exile"" and leverage a new North Korea.      

Presuming the conflict escalates in to a full fledged war and talks break down, the South Korean reserves are activated, the ROK Navy mobilizes and their armor is brought closer to the DMZ. The US assets in South Korea do the same to assist the South Koreans, most the US Seventh fleet mobilizes it's forward deployed ships (incl. USS Ronald Reagan &amp; DESRON-15) with some left behind to guard against an attack against Japan. Elements of the US COMSUBPAC will mobilize to guard against North Korean subs, and at least one more Carrier Strike Group will mobilize but most likely two.      

In the event of a full scale war the damage done to the northern parts of South Korea will be devastating, the priority will be to neutralize these attacks but getting through North Korean airspace may prove challenging due to their SAM sites. In most instances it is expected that any North Korean aircraft be easy pickings for coalition aircraft due to the condition of North Korean aircraft and their lack of flying hours. Their tanks will prove to be an issue to some degree as well, but only due to their numbers any engagement between armor will probably be expected to play out like the [Battle of 73 Easting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_73_Easting). Ground fighting will be messy, especially in urban settings as to be expected, North Korean troops will know the lay of the land and be well dug in and have the numerical advantage but coalition troops will have better equipment, support and training.        

If the conflict stays conventional North Korea may topple in 3 or even 2 months, perhaps sooner depending on the ferocity of the counterattacks. The question is how many casualties will there be on both sides, how much damage will there be to South Korea, and how messy the ensuing land grab be after it ends. When the dust settles South Korea will effectively be broke due to the money sink that is Korean reunification, then there will be the world's largest humanitarian crisis; a large uneducated, brainwashed slum just merged with one of the world's most prosperous nations.

Correct.

&gt;It wasn't binding (as I understand Dutch constitutional law) in that the Dutch Parliament could choose to just re-approve the law (or retract it) - but they had to do something.

Correct, though with the addition that the Dutch Government had made it semi-binding on themselves by pledging that ""something would be done"" with the result, and that they ""could not simply"" pass the law if it turned out to be a vote against.

pizzapapaya,,,"Well, let the neutral observers note this; the comment herein used as a condemnation against me, was the sole insult I’ve used, while you must have thrown out the words “retard” and “bullshit” like they were candy at a parade and haven’t addressed a multitude of my points.

Secondly, your point would be, if I am not mistaken, that there is reason to believe that Jesus was what we could now call “white”, but your data really goes nowhere for supporting it, rife with glaring holes and contradiction, for one, the article you’ve linked states;

""We wanted to test if the conquest of Alexander the Great and other foreign powers has left a genetic imprint on the ancient Egyptian population.""

The key term is “a genetic imprint”. For Jesus to have looked like a modern European, he would have to possess at least fifty percent general white genetics, and that’s a fairly generous, considering that the olive skin tone of the Levantine peoples is a fair diluter of white skin, but the article states:

“The study found that ancient Egyptians were most closely related to ancient populations in the Levant (modern day Syria, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon), and were also closely related to Neolithic populations from the Anatolian Peninsula and Europe.”

Clearly stating that a majority of Egyptian genetics derived from the Levantine peoples, a people who, due to their sun-drenched environment, would most likely have evolved darker skin, and that another portion derived from Anatolia, and that yet another finally touched some form of European, but the fact remains that the most likely darker skinned Anatolian and Levantine genomes were the main contributors to the overall genetics, it is highly doubtful that white would have been the primary complexion of a man like Jesus.

*but wait*

Bear in mind that Jesus was no Egyptian. Being the son of Mary, a Hebrew woman who most likely practiced Judaism as her one and only faith and therefore was solely allowed to marry (and reproduce) within the faith, just as so many other Israelites, it’s logical to assume that neither Jesus nor Mary had a majority of European genetics. One might say that the Alexandrian conquests would have changed the genome of the Levantine peoples, but one must then note the rapidity with which Hellenistic conquerors moved accross the Levant, and the majority of native Levantine to Greek settlers. The petty rapes that would have occurred among the commoners were most certainly not enough to infuse the native people with the majority European genetics needed for Jesus to look as he does in most of his European depictions.

As to your contradictions, you’ve stated that Indians should be the ones to decide what Aryan means, but you fail to note that they have, and it certainly does not mean white, perhaps fair, but not white. As well, you named Arab Muslims as the sulliers of what you claimed were white Egyptians, and then continued to insinuate that Muhammed, an Arab, was white. Your argument that the Egyptians were white is supported by an article stating that ancient Egyptians possessed a marginal amount of European genetics, very flimsy, and that goes nowhere towards supporting your claim that Jesus was white in the modern sense. Overall, you’ve used data you don’t truly understand and perhaps have not read fully, cannot refute the fact that depictions of ancient Egyptians possessed olive skin, and have made no progress in asserting that Jesus looked in any way European.

PnP. Cork was very fragile and ended up half in the bottle and half out. C'est la vie. My ah-so skills aren't up to scratch. 

Nose: musty, leather, soy sauce.

Palate: smoky, earthy, very little fruit to speak of. Tannins are very smooth. This bottle isn't quite as good as the '80 we had earlier this year, but still very nice, and went well with the food. Strip steak with sautéed mushrooms/onions, roasted tiny potatoes with salt, pepper, and rosemary, and sautéed carrots/parsnip. 

We left some of this wine sitting while we had dessert, and it mostly fell apart in the interim. 

**1979 Château Suduiraut**

PnP. Beautiful copper color. Decent viscosity. 

Nose: apricot, dried fig, honey, caramel

Palate: dried fruit, pineapple, moderate acidity, medium sweet. Not a terribly long finish. Paired with a fruit tart and vanilla bean ice cream. 

Quite tasty, but probably a bit on the downhill. I also don't really trust the provenance (based on where I bought it), so a well-kept example might be in better shape, especially in 750 mL.

wumbonumber9,,,"&gt;There was more freedom of speech (especially to insult Jews) back then. It wasn't just the Nazi that were antisemite, a good chunk of Europeans were too. And the context (German humiliation post-WWI) made things worse. I don't see how some more speeches would have change that.

you need to do more research on the subject. There was less freedom of speech in Nazi Germany than there was in the U.S.A., by  a long shot. I can see how being unaware of this can change your opinion, so I'd recommend looking into it further.

&gt;Err.. really not too sure about especially as minorities (Jews, homosexuals, Muslims, ...) are frequently the target of larger groups. Many groups representing them here (LICRA, etc.) are fighting to have the anti-hate-speech laws applied.

Of course they are, and due to freedom of speech there is a whole band of people standing up for them, as they should. In the marketplace of ideas, there will never be a credible anti-semetic threat ever again-- the only danger is in one voice or another carrying more weight. 

&gt;Fine, but again, some countries outside of the USA think otherwise.

How can a country disagree with ""It's your right to take offense, just as it's any Jewish person's right to take offense at a Neo-Nazi?"" Everyone can find everything offensive-- it's inherently subjective. Even though it seems natural to be offended at bigoted language towards specific ethnic groups, it doesn't have to be that way. 

&gt;Hate speech is forbidden when it involves attacking someone or a group as they are part of of a larger group - like religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity etc; in a word, a criteria that only concern the victim, and couldn't have a negative effect in the attacker.
It's not always clear, but it's good enough to weed out the worst

What's to say what's ""attacking?"" Are we banning criticism too? Why not ban political disagreements? A political party is a group. There will never be a fair or effective hate speech law, because ""hate speech"" itself is subjective. Your reply to me is hate speech in my mind, and who are you to say your definition is more legitimate than mine?

&gt; Arctic and major fishing nations, including China, announced Friday that they have agreed to a moratorium on commercial fishing in Arctic waters before a fishery in the icy region is even feasible.

&gt; The far north is warming at nearly twice the global average rate, causing changes in the size and distribution of fish stocks that may become more attractive to fishers in the medium to long term.

&gt; Canadian Fisheries Minister Dominic Leblanc said Canada, together with the European Union, China, Denmark - for Greenland and the Faroe Islands - Iceland, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Russia and the United States agreed &amp;quot;That no commercial fishing will take place in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean while we gain a better understanding of the area&amp;#039;s ecosystems.""

That said, I can see the appeal of conformity and architectural styles that beckon us to bygone eras and simpler times.  The flip side of this is, taken to an extreme, this means things will never change.  Bellevue will be stuck, architecturally, in the 1950s.  Many ""villages"" in Europe would be architecturally stuck centuries in the past.

I suspect that many of these styles we look back to fondly today, were borne out of practicality and necessity.  So, I'm torn between clinging on to historical sensibiliies, as opposed to continuing their spirit of doing the practical thing given your circumstances and environment.  Why shouldn't we architect houses that are cheap to build and maintain, energy efficient, resistant to weather, and optimize whatever properties you'd like.  Our ancestors building log cabins would certainly have availed themselves to our modern materials and knowledge if they could have.

violer_damores,,,"DP 21: Richmond, VA, 11/1/85- To be honest, I don't have a lot of nice things to say about this one. I was kind of dreading it going in, so maybe I just had the wrong attitude, but the setlist just didn't seem to have much to appeal to me. And I'm sad to say I was right. The first set was okay: short, a few classics (“Brown Eyed Women”, “Jack Straw”: always interested to see how those tunes evolved), some Bobby stupidity (“Dancin”, “Rooster”), but overall just a regular first set. But the second set was pretty much a drag: I mean, “High Time” and “He’s Gone” were fine, and the “Comes a Time” was interesting: it sort of just disintegrated at the end. But the climactic jam was “Sailor&gt;Drums&gt;Space&gt;Saint”, and while that is novel, to me at least, it didn't really engage me. And then they just turned into a sloppy bar cover band, with really dreadful versions of “Gimme Some Love” and “Gloria” (I won't complain about “She Belongs to Me” too much, except to say it was sloppy, lackluster, and not their best Dylan tune.) The only redeeming thing was that you got a nice “Dew” from 1980 as filler, as a reward I guess for suffering through all that mess. It wasn't easy. 

DP 22: Kings Beach, CA, 2/23-24/68- This one’s special, as it’s the earliest show released in the series. It’s maybe not true “primal Dead”, but to me 68 is the year the Dead really became the Dead, the year that “Dark Star” (and other classic tunes) entered the repertoire (I often think of 68-74, the classic “Dark Star” years, as being the essential Dead. But I'm willing to extend it to 77 to get a solid decade). These early “Dark Stars” are short, really just hinting at the jams to come in 69 and after, but it's still cool to see where it started (until one of these legendary 67 versions emerges). Like Two from the Vault (which is from 6 months later), this is just a great document of that formative year.  I love these early performances of “China Cat”: a much more frenetic take on the song, and it’s cool to hear it go into “The Eleven”. And the “Other One”&gt;”New Potato Caboose” is just pure 68 (this must be the only NPC in DP, I think). And the jams out of “Alligator” and “Caution” into “Feedback”; this is just a great listen, top to bottom, if you want to trip out to some early jams.

DP 23: Baltimore, MD, 9/17/72- As much as I love 1972, I think it's fair to say that the shows are all fairly similar, that the setlists are formulaic in a way that later years’ are not. This show is incredibly good, but I don't have anything particularly interesting to say about it at this point. Except that the second set is maybe the longest single set I've heard, and features one if the best versions of “The Other One”, clocking 40 minutes all on its own. Definitely worth a serious listen. 

DP 24: Daly City, CA, 3/23/74- This is an interesting early 74 show. They were still working out the kinks on the Wall of Sound, and it shows: there are definitely some sound problems throughout, and a big false start to open the 2nd set “playing”. But man, once they got over that hurdle: “playing”&gt;”Uncle John’s”&gt;”Morning Dew”&gt;”Uncle John’s”&gt;”playing”! That’s some shit. The “Dew” is really something: a fierce first solo, with lots of bombs from Phil, and a really delicate and beautiful second solo. As I’ve said before, I really think “Dew” from 74 has a special quality: they’re not as beautiful as 72, or as polished as 77, but they’re really interesting and powerful.

DP 25: New Haven CT &amp; Springfield MA, 5/10-11/78- Here’s a couple earlyish 78 shows where they were really locking in: from the opening cut, “Jack Straw”, they are really tearing into it. Everything is really solid, but the most interesting stuff is the second set on the second night: people online seem to think they were “on something”, which may very well be true, but they are really getting weird, vocally, from “Fire on the Mountain” and “Dancin” all the way through to “Werewolves of London.” Donna bursts out laughing at one point. Priceless. Each night also has a 20-minute “Drums”, if you like that sort of thing.

DP 26: Chicago IL &amp; Minneapolis MN, 4/26-27/69- Classic 69. A full reprise of the Live/Dead suite, “Dark Star”&gt;”St. Stephen”&gt; “The Eleven”&gt;”Lovelight” is at the heart of this one, and somehow the “Dark Star” just feels fierce to me. Plenty of other great 60s stuff in there, too, from “Dupree’s” to an early-style “Dew”: just some of that real primal goodness. I'm not familiar with “I know it's a sin”, and the “Me and my Uncle” has a different feel from the 70s versions I'm used to. Definitely an interesting and satisfying Pick. 

DP 27: Oakland CA, 12/16/92- This one was a real struggle for me. The latest-era Pick, chronologically, this documents the final iteration of the Dead. I really didn't like it, for the most part, and found myself getting actually kind of mad at times. Mostly at Bobby, which I know I'm a broken record, I'm sorry. But 80s-90s Bobby seems to embody all the worst things about rock music in the 80s, and you can really see it in a song like “Feel Like a Stranger”. Just total 80s nonsense. I've never heard them do “The Same Thing” before: I guess it's a throwback to their early blues days, which I respect as an intention. It's really awful here, though. Jerry’s not unimpeachable here either: “Loose Lucy”, while a song from their early 70s peak, has never been a favorite of mine, and this performance shows why. “Row Jimmy” assuaged my anger a bit, it always soothes my soul, but it wasn't a great performance either. And jesus, wait, I skipped “Stuck Inside of Mobile”; watching Bobby shit all over one of my favorite Dylan tunes was part of why I needed “Row Jimmy” in the first place! Things picked up a bit in the 2nd set: “Space” was probably my favorite part of this show, and it went into an interesting late “Dark Star” (the latest officially released version, I think; at least the latest on Spotify). It's not, like, especially good, but it's interesting and better than most of the rest of the stuff. “Watchtower” was less offensive than “Mobile”, and “Stella Blue” was perfectly nice. Then there's this bonus stuff from the next night: they definitely jam hard on “Throwing Stones”&gt;”NFA”. But that encore- Vince singing “Baba O’Riley” just depressed the fuck out of me. “Tomorrow Never Knows” was slightly better, but also maybe should have been left alone. Sorry: this one wasn't for me, I guess. 

DP 28: Lincoln NE &amp; Salt Lake City UT, 2/26&amp;28/73- Ok, phew, back to the good ol’ days with the Good Ol Grateful Dead. Although, it's interesting to listen to this “Loose Lucy” right after the one from 92: it wasn't a good song back in 73 either. I'm ambivalent about Donna: I'm definitely not a “Donna-hater”, like some people. Certain songs she really brings a lot to, and I was definitely missing her on “Looks Like Rain” here; I guess maybe they hadn't added her harmonies yet? Or maybe she just forgot.She definitely stinks on “Loose Lucy”, but no real loss there. Some people don't like her wailing on “playing”, but I'm into it. But the real heart of these shows is, as usual, in the second sets, in a couple of early “Eyes”. I mean, “Dark Star”&gt;”Eyes”?! That’s basically the ultimate JAM combo. It’s a dream come true, and I can’t believe this is my first time encountering it. It’s the best improvisation vehicle of Dead 1.0 meets the best improvisation vehicle of Dead 3.0; I really can’t imagine anything better. Unless…. how about “Truckin”&gt;”The Other One”&gt;”Eyes”&gt;”Morning Dew”?! This is also the era of the sweet Phil solo. Man, 73 is the shit. 

DP 29: Atlanta GA &amp; Lakeland FL, 5/19&amp;21/77- May 77! These two shows immediately precede the Pembroke Pines show released as DP 3, so there’s a certain coming full circle that’s happening here. These shows are fire, though, for real. Literally: unlike Pembroke Pines, here we finally get a true 77 “Scarlet”&gt;”Fire”, to rival Cornell 77. Except, it doesn’t. Look, I know lots of people like to say Cornell 77 is overrated, and I guess familiarity breeds contempt or whatever, but that “Scarlet”&gt;”Fire” is basically studio-quality perfect: from the bass-drops that open it, to Jerry’s impeccable first solo, to the seamless transition-- I mean Jerry doesn’t even mess up any of the lyrics, and Donna barely flubs any entrances or anything. It’s just basically flawless, in a way that no other version, including this one, is. That being said, could you imagine thinking the first set was basically over, and then they drop this 25-minute shredfest? My god, do they kill it. But I’m getting ahead of myself, because I skipped the whole first night. That second set man. First of all, I think “Samson and Delilah” is growing on me. And the “Estimated” and “Terrapin” are both extremely good. But then: “Playing”&gt;”Uncle John’s”&gt;”Drums”&gt;”The Wheel”&gt; “China Doll”&gt; Playing”? Not a bad sandwich, not bad at all: the way they segue into UJB by playing the ending first is especially noteworthy. The second night has a similarly rich second set (you know, after the first set “Scarlet”&gt;”Fire”?!): some similarities, with both nights opening the 2nd set with “Samson” - Europe 72 song - “Estimated”. This night follows this with “He’s Gone” (which gets real heavy at the end) &gt;“Drums”&gt;”The Other One”&gt; a whole bunch of stuff, I mean, you don’t need me to type out the setlist for you. Suffice it to say it seems like they were really going for something with these shows.

Begferdeth,neutral,Supreme Overlord Deez Nutz,"&gt;The OP doesn't discuss why whites would be a group, but it came up in your discussion with me. 

You have a whole section...

&gt;What I ask of you is to think to yourselves: ""Might I be one of those people?"" ""When I decided not to support white people, was that information given to me by people enforcing the mainstream view?"" ""Could there be arguments that I'm not hearing that would change my mind?"" ""Does the alt right even hold all of the positions (ie racial superiority, genocide, slavery) that I've been told it does?"" ""Are all other white people evil?"" ""Are all white people who advocate for themselves evil?"" ""What am I not hearing?"" 

White people this, white people that. But your not saying whites are a group or anything.

&gt;but you're closer to every other white than any nonwhite, which is why I don't think whites should treat nonwhites like other whites. 

Once you are past a certain distance, lets say roundabout where you don't realize you are family anymore, blood doesn't matter. Do you treat your friends better than not-friends? Why? Shouldn't you do some genetic test to see how blood related you are or something? 

&gt;Even in some of our bloodiest wars though, we've paused to sing Christmas carols together.

You know, bringing up an event that happened in one of the most incredibly brutal and bloody wars in human history, one that has affected our worldview and politics for a century, really isn't a good point in favor of ""White people get along with each other better.""

&gt;Not when mixed. We totally settled our differences within a couple generations.

So, what we gotta do is mix? Great! We have never tried that with different races. Even in the ""melting pot"", its more like a chopped salad: That's a tomato over there, and that's a carrot over there. 

&gt;There was no long period of hatred

Sure, as long as you ignore most of European history. And North American history. Hell, just ignore all history before the USA formed. And some of it since.

&gt;Since they started mass immigrating to this country in 1965

Holy shit, that's like... 50 years! So long. Everything should have been solved by now, especially since there were no laws holding things back, no political groups trying to keep things the way they were... Oh wait. Right. History.

You know, 50 years is only a couple generations. Didn't you say that whites settled their differences in only a couple generations? 

&gt; it never took European ethnicities that long

Except for the Irish, who took a couple generations (ie over 50 years, hey where did I see that number recently...), and much of their acceptance was due to their participation in the Civil War. 

&gt;I never said to cut off trade partners. I said to form a all white ethnostate.

Right. Not going to affect trade at all to remove all the nonwhites from the country through (insert whatever method you like today). 

&gt;They don't create major problems, due to their racial tendencies, but they don't assimilate in any way that I can think of.

Wait, you say ethnic groups always have this big tension and this is why we need a white ethnostate, but now we have asians causing no major problems? One that I would say has blended in quite nicely during my time living in Toronto? This doesn't add up. How can we get along so well?

&gt;they mostly hung out together and didn't come to white parties or anything.

Well, if it was a ""white party""... 

&gt;That's why they ""blend in"". 

You think Jews don't blend in? They are causing some major strife in our society? They work, they go to school, they don't start fights, why are we kicking them out again? 

&gt;Throughout history, those taboos weren't in place, which is why they stuck out like crazy.

So... we stopped treating them like shit, and they blended in. Huh. Wow. Why go backwards and kick them out? 

&gt;How do you know that a white 1% wouldn't care about you?

There are lots of white 1% right now. They don't care about me. This is just asking ""Why do you think this thing that already happened would happen?""

water resistance in vitro [(quantitative)](http://dermatest.com.au/pdf/WR%20in%20vitro%20Quant.pdf) [(qualitative)](http://dermatest.com.au/pdf/WR%20in%20vitro%20Qual.pdf)

&gt;Resistance to water immersion and sweating is also an important aspect of a sunscreen performance. In the USA, this is measured in vivo, by the ability of a product to withstand water immersion. SPF has to remain unchanged after two 2-minute immersions for a ‘water-resistant’ product. A ‘very water resistant’ product will offer the same protection after four 2-minute immersions. Each 20-minute immersion interval is followed by a 20-minute rest/air dry period until the total water exposure time is reached. In Europe, the SPF after a 40- and 80-minute water immersion period is measured and compared with the original SPF before water exposure. A product is considered ‘water resistant’ or ‘extra water resistant’ if the SPF data after 40- or 80-minute immersions, respectively, is greater or equal to 50% of the pre-immersion SPF. Thus, the SPF number on the product label for European sunscreen products is pre-water exposure, whereas in the USA, the SPF on the label corresponds to the measurements after the water immersion cycles.

DukeofVermont,,,"Nope, most wars did not effect that many people at all. The key here is MOST wars, as in 8 out of 10 wars are small, not that the other 2 are not horrible AND that even when they were horrible it didn't leave a nation in ruin like WWI and WWII did...unless you mean the 30 years war.

I don't know who taught you history but most wars have not been rape and pillage the countryside type of deals.  

I said that there were exceptions like the 30 years war.

&gt;World War I cost France 1,357,800 dead, 4,266,000 wounded (of whom 1.5 million were permanently maimed) and 537,000 made prisoner or missing — exactly 73% of the 8,410,000 men mobilized, according to William Shirer in The Collapse of the Third Republic. Some context: France had 40 million citizens at the start of the war; six in ten men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-eight died or were permanently maimed.

6 out of 10...oh yeah WWI didn't effect a lot of people, just a few died. The British had to keep lowering the height requirement for soldiers as all the tall men had died and there were not enough young tall men to keep up. See [bbc news](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31023270)

What I am talking about is a lot of European wars were more like the War of the Bavarian Succession where about 20,000 died on both sides from mostly disease.

Yes there were large wars in Europe, but they were not the Norm. Of the UK's 96 conflicts about 15 of them are major wars. Most were single or two battles, a lot like the Norman invasion.

TLDR: Yes major wars did happen but they were not the majority. Many smaller wars were fought over who would gain a title after someones death. Like the Norman invasion which was one battle and then it was over. There were revolts after but no real wars.

ALSO as time went on wars did get more deadly. I was thinking more about 800-1600 vs 1600-1900. But even in the time period of 1600-1900 the majority of wars were small....BUT the big ones were really bad.

I mean Blair's relationship with 'socialism' being described by out of principal sounds about right, from the way he frames it becomes obvious that he's detaching it from the economics (which is..well a significant proportion of the idea of course) and therefore I can't see past him using it as metaphors, going through the motions left it in his heart, for example he says something similar to your quote in this too:

&gt; I developed a theory about the basis of socialism being about ‘community’ – i.e. people owed obligations to each other and were social beings, not only individuals out for themselves – which pushed me down the path of trying to retrieve Labour’s true values from the jumble of ideological baggage that was piled on top of them, obscuring their meaning. For me, it was socialism, and wasn’t about a particular type of economic organisation,anchored to a particular point in history. 

Interestingly it reminds me of that famous Thatcher quote, except this being the polar opposite of it.

&gt; To say socialism is unattainable would require you to first set the context, as in what form of socialism do you think is unattainable, as there are many many forms that exist.

Referring to pretty much this

Now we have a post for ever representative on their respective subreddits, which normally doesn't garner much attention at all.

zoozoo458,,Sunder,"The Ladies Rites is probably the the most substantial feminine tradition. Girls who begin menstruating undergo a number of trials to prepare them for womanhood. They fast for several days, spend hours doing pointless tasks (like rolling a boulder back and forth), they sit motionless for a full day and night, they go on a long hunt (sometimes symbolic with little actual hunting), kill their first farm animal, or travel to a city. The final trial takes place in the local Temple where they spend a whole night inhaling earthly fumes that cause them to hallucinate. In the morning all the women in the village smear a bit of their blood on the girl's forehead and from that point on she is considered an adult. All of these trials are done with a mother or other female relative, men have no involvement.

Northern women will tattoo their arms with important moments in their life (not all traditions are universal but the Tacaya are spread across an area the size of western Europe so some amount of variation is inevitable).

Most women will have worked with their priestess to maintain the local Temple.

The three sacred texts of the Lady (the Trials, the Way, and the Law) are drilled into young noblewomen, so most will know it very well.

The Ides is a yearly tradition where all the women in a community get shit faced and reminisce about the past.

Makeup is common and follow similar styles (bright and colorful for leisure, darker and more subtle for formal).

Pregnant women will abstain for desires and selfishness.

They have the same naming structure (given name - maternal family name - titles - liege) and a private name.

There is a shared idea of when a person should be formal and when they can be crude (if alcohol is present than there is no expectation of formality).

Hunting among the nobility is seen as a feminine sport and is a common social event.

Most of these traditions aren't exclusive to women, men will learn the sacred texts and hunt but it is often done in the pursuit of femininity. An ambitious man who wants to rule or have a role in politics has to act like a woman (the Tacaya believe that a male who is feminine is neither a man or a women but somewhere in between).",True,0,1512189131,,False,0,dqn7whe,False,t3_7gz6zm,t1_dqn43dj,/r/worldbuilding/comments/7gz6zm/how_are_men_underprivileged_in_your_matriarchy/dqn7whe/,1514257246,1,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,public,

Cingetorix,,,"&gt;the slave markets wouldn’t exist if the US hadn’t deposed Gaddhafi - true imo.

Yeah, that's not true at all. Slavery has been prevalent in Africa since the beginning of civilization and [continues to this day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_contemporary_Africa#Slavery_by_country) in places like Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Sudan and the Congo.

Hell, the Middle East basically started the whole practice of the slave trade, [predating the Europeans by more than half a millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_slave_trade). It still occurs in places like Saudi Arabia. And Libya has a long history of slave trade, [starting in the Berber period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Libya). After Qaddafi's death, it simply went back to how it used to be. 

&gt; Europe in particular colonized them and extracted wealth and natural resources. Now the bill is coming due and they’re faking having go to the bathroom.

So? That's what happens when stronger countries take advantage of weaker ones. It happened after WW1 when the winning states basically disarmed Germany and made it go bankrupt, and now look where Germany is when it comes to economic power. Somehow it seems that only the Europeans can go kill each other, destroy the vast majority of their heavy industry and population, yet bounce right back without much of a problem. 

&gt;Looking at geopolitics from an amoral lense also leads to ruin.

Depending for whom. The West is doing perfectly fine, and the only people that governments should care for is their own. Taking advantage of other nations / regions in pursuit of state wealth and power is simply how history has unfolded since the dawn of human civilization.

Sega's real problem was that there was very little in the way of collaboration between the divisions of Sega and there wasn't a good working relationship with third parties, leading to inner conflicts in the company that crippled them in the face of rising competition and poisoning the well for any newcomers who wanted to release a game on their console, instead pushing them towards Sony and Nintendo.

PortugalBot,,,"&gt; r/portugal *-* Ideal monárquico está a seduzir simpatizantes do Bloco e do PCP ([37 comentários](https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/7h0sxm/))

## O feriado de hoje traz uma novidade: há muitos militantes de esquerda dos principais partidos a frequentar as academias de formação monárquica e deputados que defendem a família real no protocolo de Estado

O atual Presidente da República foi nomeado administrador [vitalício] da Fundação da Casa de Bragança; Rui Moreira, entregou o cartão para ser autarca do Porto, tal como Miguel Albuquerque, presidente do governo regional da Madeira; Paulo Portas suspendeu a militância monárquica para ir para o governo; há socialistas partidários do referendo à monarquia no Parlamento; os comunistas convidam frequentemente D. Duarte para visitar as autarquias e há militantes do Bloco de Esquerda a frequentar os encontros da Juventude Monárquica...

O que se passa com os ideais republicanos e o que ganham os defensores da monarquia com a descrença dos portugueses num sistema político democrático em que os escândalos surgem em catadupa no Portugal que hoje volta a comemorar pela segunda vez o feriado da Restauração da Independência depois de o PSD e o CDS o terem abolido na anterior legislatura, um país em que D. Duarte quer ser entronizado como chefe de Estado e propõe substituir-se aos presidentes da República na qualidade de rei.

Quando se pergunta a Dom Duarte se a alteração da chefia de Estado não é ir longe de mais, responde assim: ""O que não compreendo é que não se autorize numa democracia acabar com o sistema democrático."" Deveria esta questão fazer parte de uma próxima revisão constitucional? D. Duarte acha que sim: ""Não é honesto não fazer a pergunta aos portugueses, até porque a República foi proclamada por golpe militar e nunca foi referendada.""

Se é óbvio que D. Duarte desejaria que a monarquia que representa e lidera voltasse a ter um papel tutelar na organização política portuguesa, o mesmo não se esperaria dos republicanos, principalmente de militantes dos partidos mais à esquerda. Não existindo números oficiais sobre os que olham com tolerância um regresso a uma governação monárquica ao nível mais alto, D. Duarte acena com um argumento: ""Há uma sondagem feita por altura do centenário da República que ficou na gaveta porque não interessava revelar as suas conclusões: 40% disseram que não são republicanos. Se com a atual situação, 40 % já perceberam que o sistema republicano de chefia de Estado não é boa para Portugal, estou convencido que se houvesse informação sobre o sistema monárquico essa percentagem iria aumentar com certeza. Basta ver os bons exemplos de países europeus.""

D. Duarte vai mais longe ao considerar que o comportamento do Presidente Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa ""é semelhante ao que seria o de um rei"" e que por via desta atuação política fica mais fácil aos portugueses comparar os dois regimes. Por isso alerta: ""Não se sabe quem se seguirá depois dele. Pode não ter este perfil, como alguns dos seus antecessores, que desagradaram a grande parte da população e preocuparam-se mais em favorecer o partido de onde vinham."" Para que não fiquem dúvidas sobre a comparação entre rei e Presidente, recorda: ""Quem mais claramente tentou agir como um rei enquanto Presidente foi o general Eanes.""

**Projeto político falhado**

Não é preciso investigar muito para confirmar que os ideais monárquicos sempre seduziram bastante os que em Portugal votam CDS, ligeiramente menos os do PSD e um pouco os do PS, mas o que surpreende é que atualmente militantes de esquerda se interessem pelos ideais monárquicos: do PCP e do Bloco de Esquerda, por exemplo. Uma realidade política que pode parecer inacreditável quase cento e dez anos após a implantação da República e apesar de todo o esforço com que os republicanos baniram os representantes da dinastia de Bragança e confiscaram os seus bens, mas que nos últimos tempos se deleitam com as reportagens do casamento de Dom Duarte com Isabel de Herédia, ou ainda, no fim de semana passado, com o relato do baile de debutantes em Paris que apresentou a filha Maria Francisca à sociedade, na companhia dos irmãos Afonso e Dinis.

Ao fim de quatro décadas de democracia, pode dizer-se que a tentativa dos representantes e simpatizantes da monarquia em obterem um papel político através das eleições falhou. Essa solução surgiu com a formação de uma estrutura partidária, o Partido Popular Monárquico (PPM), que teve em Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles um dos principais impulsionadores, mas as divergências com D. Duarte levaram a um quase desligamento do partido e à pouca representação eleitoral.

A deputada do PPM na Assembleia Municipal de Lisboa, Aline Gallasch-Hall de Beuvink, uma das duas deputadas que foram eleitas em coligação com o CDS, insiste nas virtualidades da chefia real do Estado enquanto defende o partido que representa: ""O pouco peso político do PPM não é problema. Temos 43 anos de história e preconizámos várias ideias que só 20 anos depois foram tomadas. Se acham que a monarquia é retrógrada é porque não percebem que é algo presente no quotidiano de vários países da Europa. Sempre dos mais avançados e com melhor nível de vida.""

Há mais de uma década criaram-se as Reais Associações em todos os distritos portugueses e, com a organização madura, surgiu a Causa Real. Um movimento em torno de D. Duarte, que o inspirou também, onde se reúnem os ativistas monárquicos, mas também os simpatizantes que existem espalhados pelo país e que votam - com exceção das eleições presenciais em que a maioria se recusa a escolher um presidente - nos partidos que mais os atraem.

**Sedução à esquerda**

O que surpreende é que o modelo de governação em vigor em Portugal já seja preterido por milhares de portugueses que veem numa chefia de Estado protagonizada por D. Duarte a melhor solução. Uma surpresa que cresce quando se podem contabilizar algumas dezenas de militantes de esquerda, vindos do Partido Comunista Português e do Bloco de Esquerda, sempre presentes nas sessões em que se reúnem monárquicos mais tradicionais.

Uma das estruturas monárquicas que tem recebido mais apoios esquerdistas é a Juventude Monárquica. O presidente da organização, Gonçalo Martins Silva, confirma que pelo menos duas dezenas de esquerdistas vão regularmente aos encontros da organização na região de Santarém: ""Há muita gente nova e cada vez mais pessoas aparecem regularmente, independentemente dos quadrantes políticos habituais."" Especifica: ""Além do CDS e do PSD, temos tido bastantes inscrições de jovens que vêm da Juventude Socialista, uma dezena do PCP e, surpreendentemente, do Bloco de Esquerda também. Estes são a grande novidade.""

""Sabe-se de onde vêm porque na ficha de inscrição existe um espaço para dizer a que organizações pertencem. Posso dizer que é muito diferente de há uns anos, quando havia apenas uma ou duas inscrições. Nos últimos tempos é mais tão notório e surpreendente porque têm uma natureza republicana que nos surpreendeu."" Acrescenta: ""Estou muito contente, porque são pessoas que não nos costumavam apoiar!""

O responsável da Juventude Monárquica refere que as reuniões monárquicas que atraem os simpatizantes de esquerda não se preocupam apenas em debater os ideais monárquicos: ""Não somos uma juventude partidária, fazemos parte da Causa Real e quem frequenta estas Academias são jovens em que o denominador comum é apoiar D. Duarte.""

Poder-se-ia achar que é só ao nível de jovens de esquerda, mas o presidente da Causa Real, António de Sousa-Cardoso, esclarece: ""Temos cada vez mais simpatizantes e um enorme aumento de curiosidade sobre o movimento devido à perda de referências e de identidades das populações."" Quando se lhe pergunta quantos são os filiados, aponta ""cerca de dez mil associados"" e faz questão de deixar claro que ""temos pessoas de todos os partidos representados na Assembleia da República"", militantes que assinaram a ""petição para acolhimento de D. Duarte no protocolo de Estado"".

doneanddead,CHIN,China,"This measures ethnic diversity. Ethnic diversity is not the same as cultural diversity, and is only one measurement compared to linguistic diversity, religious diversity, etc. This is important because while ethnic groups often have a separate language, it's not always true and sometimes, an ethnic group can have multiple languages. An example of this goes back to China; we, the Shanghainese, consider ourselves to be part of the Han majority, but also speak a different language from the rest of Han China in addition to Mandarin. This is great for linguistic diversity, but we don't make a difference in ethnic diversity. 

Regarding Cultural Diversity, we can note that [the US is considered less culturally diverse than](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/18/the-most-and-least-culturally-diverse-countries-in-the-world/) a few additional nations. 

[When we consider Religious diversity,](http://www.pewforum.org/2014/04/04/religious-diversity-index-scores-by-country/), we can see that the UK, Czechia, Belarus, Luxembourg, Russia, Germany, Sweden, Macedonia, Latvia, Belgium, France, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Netherlands all outrank the US. Montenegro and Slovenia are right behind the US. 

Also, a huge issue with these types of measurements overall is that ethnic groups are hard to define. Ethnicity isn't a hard science; it's based on a combination of factors. Some people might consider one group to be one ethnicity, while others might consider it to be multiple ethnicity. There also has to be the question posed of ""at what point should researchers step in and say that 'this is a separate ethnicity,' or should it always be up to the people in question?"" With the Shanghainese example again, we have our own style of cuisine and speak our own language; that's more of a difference than exists between several recognised ethnic groups. The Cantonese are similar, yet we all recognise them as part of the same ethnic group. If there exists a movement in Shanghai to recognise ourselves as Shanghainese people first and not as Han, does that mean that recognition of the Shanghainese ethnic group suddenly becomes a thing even if that's the only factor to change? What if it goes further? What if French, Spanish, and Polish people all begin to identify very hard with the European Union and consider themselves the same ethnic group, even though there are religious differences, linguistics differences, cultural differences, historical differences, etc. and there's no attempt to mix them.

Okay, big Cinema sins fan, here is my go at it, sorry it's pretty long, I tried to implement the common sins they use in Cinema sins:

Everything Wrong with the Temple Endowment in 14 minutes or less. Spoilers. (duh)

Narration, and I’m not even looking at anything yet. I’m pretty sure your hope that I’m going to have joy in the house of the Lord this day is not going to happen. Sin Tally – 1

Okay more than half of the people in this room are over 70, do they really have to stop this whole thing anytime someone forgets the new name? It’s the same thing for everyone in the room so just implement a good Samaritan policy or something where you can just lean over and ask your neighbor, sheesh. Sin Tally – 2

Narration telling me I will be hearing more narration. Sin Tally – 3

Shit, can this get anymore repetitive? Were they trying to keep the budget low or something? They are literally using the same exact narrative for seven different days of animated I don’t give a fuck. Sin Tally – 4 

I’ll admit, I kind of like how they show the drawings as plans and then they go down and everything is live action, but did the creation part of this really have to be this long? They are literally saying the same things over and over and they have nothing to do with the plot. That’s a sin for each day. Sin Tally – 11

I’ve gone 45 minutes without seeing a woman in this film. Sin Tally – 12 

“and we will provide a Savior for him,” Roll credits. Sin Tally 13

“Jehovah, is it good for man to be alone?” So are you telling me that women were only made to give men companionship? The whole reason for their existence is for man to not be alone? No wonder God doesn’t like homosexual men, it’s like they are rejecting his gift. I make the distinction of homosexual men because we all know he doesn’t really care about women, homosexual or not. Sin Tally – 14 

Eve is not giving me a lap dance in this scene. Sin Tally – 15

I understand that this is a Mormon film inside of a Mormon temple, but the bush placement in this film is a serious boner killer. Sin Tally – 16 

Okay so Lucifer is supposed to be the bad guy in this, but if Adam and Eve hadn’t listened to him, then Elohim’s whole plan would have been totally fucked. What if Adam and Eve had both been like, “Naw, that’s okay, this garden is the shit, I don’t need that fruit Lucifer.” Would God have been like, “Well Jehovah, looks like we don’t need you after all, they did what they were supposed to and now we have like billions of spirits up here that will never get bodies. Maybe I should have told them to eat the fruit instead…” Sin Tally – 17

Bad son hates his emotionally distant father cliché. Sin Tally – 18

What the hell is up with Elohim asking so many questions he already knows the answer to? Sin Tally – 19

I haven’t heard this much whining about who’s fault it was since I got my first blow job in college. Sin Tally – 20

Lucifer would be really good at Cinema Sins. Sin Tally – 21 

Mormon can’t handle the logic of an unbeliever so they ask them to just leave cliché. Sin Tally – 22

Cherubim and a flaming sword would have been something really cool to see in this, but instead they blew their whole budget on some stupid 45 minute long creation period. Sin Tally – 23

Okay, so Eve actually did what had to be done by actually using her brain, Elohim knew this the whole time, and now he is placing Adam as ruler over Eve? How does that make sense? I mean did he just pick Adam as his go to because he would do whatever he was asked without ques... oh now I get it. Sin Tally – 24

Wait the movie stopped, more narration, and I have to stand? The fuck? Sin Tally – 25

Don’t they talk about secret signs and tokens in the Book of Mormon as belonging to the Gadianton Robbers? At the beginning of this shit they gave me the chance to leave, but I had no idea this is what was going to go down. Is it okay to leave now, or did I miss that ship? This knowledge is already going to condemn me? Shit. Sin Tally – 26

Wait, do I have any kind of option in this? They are literally telling me to bow my head and say yes. Talk about a leading question. Sin Tally – 27

Movie started back up and now Eve is wearing clothes. Sin Tally – 28

Okay, why does Lucifer keep referring to other people? I’m assuming Adam and Eve haven’t had any kids yet so they are supposed to be the only people here. And here I was thinking Lucifer was the only smart one. Sin Tally – 29

Also, how does Adam not know this is Lucifer? He just talked to him right before he left the garden, and didn’t that fruit he ate make him smarter or something? Seriously he literally has never talked to anyone else besides Eve, I think he would recognize this guy. Sin Tally – 30

So I know the Doctrine and Covenants didn’t exist at this time, but it specifically states that a righteous spirit without a body will not shake your hand as to not deceive you, and yet the very first thing Peter does is shake Adam’s hand. This is meant to emphasize that Lucifer doesn’t have a body and can’t do that, but where the fuck did Peter get a body? Is he using a time turner or something? Sin Tally – 31

“Now is the great day of my power. I reign from the rivers to the ends of the earth. There is none who dares to molest or make afraid.” Hahahahahahahahaha. Sin Tally – 32

This return and report shit is really getting annoying. Haven’t these guys ever heard of prayer? They don’t really need to go all the way back to tell Jehovah what happened just so he can turn around and tell Elohim exactly the same thing, do they? Does Elohim not already know all this? Couldn’t Peter, James, and John just have given him the further light and knowledge as soon as they knew Adam had been faithful? This seems like a huge waste of time. Sin Tally – 33

Wait the movie is over? I thought this was two hours long? I have to stand again? Sin Tally – 34

Shit, I thought the stuff before was bad, but what the actual fuck are these clothes? Sin Tally – 35

I’d sin more specifically all this ritualistic shit that seriously is boring the hell out of me, but I just don’t care, and neither does anyone else. 20 sins. Sin Tally – 55

I just put these clothes on, why didn’t you just tell me the right way the first time? Sin Tally – 56

The women have to cover their faces when this man prays to God in the true order of prayer? Is this 18th century Europe? Or present day Pakistan? Sin Tally – 57

So I literally could have just slept through this whole thing and you still would have let me into the VIP room? Sin Tally – 58

WikiTextBot,,,"**Normandy landings**

The Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune) were the landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (termed D-Day) of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. The largest seaborne invasion in history, the operation began the liberation of German-occupied northwestern Europe from Nazi control, and contributed to the Allied victory on the Western Front.

Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable.

Elizabeth can’t spend $99 to test herself and prove everyone wrong?

I love this, but never used it for jobs etc. we had the same stories in our family. I had aunts, uncles, myself, my children and a few cousins take a DNA test. We’re all European. But I have a huge extended family and the Native American part had already been disproven by a full genealogy report/linage history that had cost thousands about 20 years ago.

We still have family members who claim they did some recent research over the last couple of years and we’re Native American. It’s not possible at all, even my mom who took a DNA test tries to repeat the new *research*.  Every DNA test result showed European but for some reason these people can’t comprehend what that means.

My maternal great grandfather disappeared, it was said he abandoned the family and went back to live on an Indian reservation(no idea why that story was even started, maybe it helped my great grandmother and small children cope with being abandoned). In actuality he moved back home to Chicago to his parents or his other wfe/kidsi(can’t remember) or got remarried there and had kids. This is the early 1900’s so he was never caught for polygamy.

But they all drive me crazy with not understanding their research is incorrect.

ComradePeppers,,,"This will be a long read, and I am admitedly playing devil's advocate for the professor. However, I do hope that you will read all the way through this and respond with your thoughts about what I am going to say. My response is based on several years of reading and thinking about language, language use, and language instruction. Please forgive me for my lack of citations, as it would be impossible to cite every idea I am going to discuss. This is a synthesis of several scholars spanning several fields and many, many years of academic discussion.

When the teacher says you should ""use multicultural and anti-racist curriculum"" to ""promote language awareness,"" here is what I think she likely means: 

As an adult instructor to young students, you are in a position of power. You are their elder, and you hold a position (teacher) which society deems as worthy of respect. As such, the students look up to you; they see you as an authority figure, as a source of truth and wisdom. The things you say, the attitudes you present, and the morals you portray all influence the way that the students will think about themselves, about their peers, about their families, about their communities, about their nations, and about the world at large. Therefore, knowing these things, when you enter you the classroom, you should be always vigilant to present to the students the best version of yourself that you can present.

Here are some nuances which apply to the unique case of teaching English as a second language to students who live in non-English speaking nations: First (and most important, in my opinion), when you teach someone a language, you are teaching them much more than just the words and syntax of a system of communication; you are also teaching them an ideology. When you think to yourself in your head, how is it that you process ideas? If you are like me, you have a running commentary or voice inside your head which processes the world by translating sensory experiences like sight and sound into English words. The way that we perceive the world is influenced by the languages in which we are able to think. For this reason, language and ideology are closely and complexly intertwined. The words which are available to us in a specific language, the ways which our syntactic system allows us to arrange words in sentences and paragraphs, and even the way that our system allows us to construct new words all have an influence on the way that we think about the world that we experience. Second, the English language has experienced massive changes throughout its history. The following texts were all written in languages which historically have been called English: [Beowulf in Old English](http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/Beowulf.Readings/Prologue.html), [The Canterbury Tales in Middle English](http://www.bartleby.com/40/0101.html), [Hamlet in Early Modern English](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/hamlet-play/text-act-1-scene-1/), and [Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five in Present Day English](https://dinascommonplace.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/kurt-vonnegut-excerpt-from-slaughterhouse-five/). The first and fourth languages do not look like one another at all. Now, what is important to note with the term ""Present Day English,"" the term we use to describe the language as it is spoken and written today, is that the phrase is packed with all kinds of other nuances. For example, English-speaking nations have had a long history of imperialism and subjugation. Since the early 19th century, the most powerful nation-states in the world have been English speaking ones (The British Empire and The United States). While, as native English speakers, we may view it as a good thing that the language was spread to far-reaching corners of the globe, try viewing the situation from the perspective of those to whom the language was spread. Did the people in India in the 19th and 20th centuries want to be taught the English language? Did the indigenous peoples of Australia or North America want to be taught the language? Did the African natives who were captured, enslaved, and sold to Europeans in North America want to be taught how to speak English? 

With all of these things in mind, you must consider these questions: Is there such a thing as Official English? If so, who gets to decide what is ""official English"" or ""correct English""? Is the English language a single set-in-stone, rigid, strict rules-based language, or is it a living language with many constantly changing varieties, flavors, dialects, and rule systems? Is it fair or just that the descendants of those subjugated people now speak English today instead of their ancestors' native languages? Should we consider [dialects, creoles, and pidgins](http://www.edu-cyberpg.com/Linguistics/explainpidgin.html) to be ""English,"" or should we only consider as English that which is written in academic journals and textbooks?

Teaching ""language awareness"" involves discussing these questions with your students alongside the vocabulary and grammar instruction. It involves realizing that the way that you speak English is not the ""right"" way, but merely one of many ways. It involves passing that on to your students, telling them that English is not and has never been a monolithic set of rules, that the way they speak English with accents or with native words sprinkled in (like Spanglish) are just as valid as speaking English without an accent. It involves being aware of the racial history of the language and being aware that many people in the United States today do not speak English because their ancestors were born freely into English-speaking societies or because their ancestors chose to learn the language, but because their ancestors were forced into English-speaking society, sometimes through actual enslavement.

Conclusion: I have some serious gripes with the term ""multicultural,"" and I downright abhor the word ""anti-racist."" I think that they are empty jargon employed by the corporatist structure of American universities to appease populist desires for equality and inclusion. Basically, I think that those words are just bullshit used to make more liberal students attend an institution. I think they are misused and abused by activist professors. I often wonder if the word ""anti-racist"" operates like the word ""antihero."" Where an antihero is a hero who achieves positive results through morally questionable means, an ""anti-racist"" might be someone who achieves a net-positive effect on equality and acceptance through morally questionable means. Often, I think that these ""anti-racists"" can be just as racist as actual, full-on white supremacist-type racists, just in a more refined, carefully constructed, rhetorically savvy way. They achieve good results, but not for good reasons or through good behaviors and attitudes. Now, that is not to say that I disagree with their intended purpose. I think that the goals at the heart of the ""multicultural"" and ""anti-racist"" movements are good and positive for society. I think that, done properly, a curriculum which teaches ""language awareness"" is one which teaches language learning students to accept themselves, teaches native speakers to accept non-native speakers, and which generally makes a society more accepting of differences. I just think that the movements have been co-opted by some bad people who are using the ethos and language of the original intent as a cover for their more sinister social goals. I also think that activist pick up the buzzwords and use them to signal political values without understanding what the words actually represent.",True,0,1512197291,,False,0,dqnci5n,False,t3_7gza9d,t3_7gza9d,/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7gza9d/interesting_finding_in_my_teaching_course/dqnci5n/,1514259980,2,False,JordanPeterson,t5_32jqy,public,

That's pure rhetoric, a cheap shot for the purposes of ridicule. 

When did I say that? When did I suggest that? Are you implying that Catalan independence is a decade old? Are you implying that they've never tried before, never thought of it? Are you seriously trying to argue that? What point are you trying to make there?

 Scotland played by the UK's rules because the UK went out of its way to let Scotland decide. 

And Spain and Austria-Hungary were based on the decisions of monarchs and nobles, as opposed to politicians and bureaucrats for Czechoslovakia. Which is better because reasons?

My point is that Catalonia is no different from any other small nation in Europe. There is nothing new or unique about it. It's barely different from Portugal in terms of population and difference from Spanish. The Irish economy is doing okay. Catalonia is bigger than Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Finland. 

""Because you say so."" Yeah that's not going to cut it as an argument. Sorry. Again, I fail to see what distinguishes it from Portugal, or the Netherlands for example. Also, nations can exist regardless of whether they are countries or not. See: The Kurds. Or most European nations prior to independence. 

Most nations didn't do it overnight. Catalonia didn't either. For the most part, independence movements are sporadic, popping up a few times each century. If you have a short memory, you can pretend only the most recent incarnation of it existed. 

Yes, a post-communist nation of 1.3 million is slightly less well off than a nation several times bigger and which is in a wealthier region of Europe.

* une vérité *sciemment* détournée dans le but de porter atteinte à la réputation d'une personne est aussi une diffamation. L'article wikipedia donne comme exemple *« telle année M. X a eu une affaire de vol de voiture » alors que la réalité des faits est qu'on avait volé à cette époque la voiture de M. X*.  
 Mais si dans ce cas il avait réellement volé une voiture comme la phrase le sous entend), ce n'est pas de la diffamation. Il y eu une affaire comme ça il y a pas longtemps où un politicien présentait l'autre comme escroc, se fait poursuivre, et est relaxé au motif que l'autre avait effectivement été condamné pour escroquerie.  

Je vois ça comme ça:

masamunecyrus,Camera,,"&gt;What am I reading?

Firstly, the report you linked is Consumer Report's annual reliability study, rather than their long-term reliability.

Here's a [long term reliability plot](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/images/1007/conrep2.jpg), also from Consumer Reports, from 2008. While it's admittedly becoming dated, now, I'd argue that 9 years isn't that long when considering long-term reliability, and market-wide perceptions of reliability usually lag a few years. As an example, the entire US car industry has turned around considerably since the recession. Anyways, in the plot above, VW's reliability is *not good.*

Here's another data point with the [2013 JD Power vehicle dependability study](http://d1arsn5g9mfrlq.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/legacy_files/pictures/j/jdpower/1048/d113c91c0a0d02b701d3ac6eb051e9f9-600x800.jpg), which looks at problems with 3-year old vehicles. VW is near the bottom below Chrysler. Audi is worse than Hyundai. And Hyundais are a lot cheaper to fix in America than an Audi.

While I'm certainly open to the possibility that various makes have turned things around--Mercedes had a bad few years when the whole Daimler-Chrysler thing happened, but they've since turned around and are at the top of the quality charts, now--[the 2017 JD Power Vehicle Dependability Study](http://d1arsn5g9mfrlq.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/17_vds_chart_1.jpg) doesn't show anything remarkable. Even in 2017, while Audi and VW have both moved up, VW is still below the industry average--and Chrysler--while Audi barely squeaks by above the industry average, and below GMC.

Edit: and another data point from Dashboard Light which mostly mirrors what JD Power and Consumer Reports show:

http://www.dashboard-light.com/reports/Audi.html

Are these vehicles driving around on the Autobahn and known throughout Europe for quality? Yes. But that flies in the face of the data in the US. Hence, I was wondering if the ones sold in the US are made in different factories. A Honda bought in Japan and a Honda bought in America are not made in the same place, for instance.

red8462,,,"The thing that fascinates me about the Manchus, the Qing Dynasty, is how can they be so stupid? 

They had contact with the British and Europeans for hundreds of years.  So it's not like the Opium War just happened overnight, and a foreign country came in and militarily destroyed them.  They had plenty of time to prepare for war.  Or at least, to draw the opponents into a stalemate.  

Qing Dynasty warfare technology and techniques were completely obsolete.  It's like, China was fighting with bows and arrows, while Britain came in with cannons and steamships powered by coal.  There was just no competition.  

It's like an evil alien race came in from outer space with advanced weapons and technology, and made your weapons look stone-aged and primitive by comparison.  

The Manchus inherited China, and they were able to expand China's territory.  But then, they stagnated.  They also suffered from over-population, and their agrarian farming methods could no longer keep up with their surging population.  So there was a lot of internal social problems.  But regardless, they failed to see the bigger picture, and the threat waiting for them over the horizon.  

The fall of the Qing started in the early 1800s.  At the same time, the Industrial Revolution in England was in the late 1700s and early 1800s.  This enabled the British and Europeans to build all the weapons and technology to dominate the world, and to destroy China.  

But more importantly, the British and Europeans mastered the math and science to understand how to create, how to build, and how to use those weapons.  

I think this is where China failed.  They didn't establish a University education system, where they could train their best and brightest.  

China didn't utilize the scientific method, nor discovered the Calculus, nor physics.  It seems like they just stopped experimenting.  They stopped creating.  

Why?  Who knows?  Maybe this was the fault of the Manchus.  They failed to modernize and reform themselves socially, economically, educationally, militarily, and technologically.  So by 1900, maybe it was just their time to go.  They had their chance at eternity, and they lost it.  They lost the Mandate of Heaven.  

Maybe the best lesson I can learn from this is: 

Kids, stay in school.  Don't do drugs.  Learn your math, science, and technology.  Always keep learning, experimenting, and creating.  Keep up with the Jones.  Otherwise, someone will come in and destroy your civilization.

homunculusjr,,,"Well I like to think I know the history pretty well. And the communists are not to blame for the ridiculous death toll you've proposed here. I'll start off by saying that, even though I identify as a communist, I don't think Mao, Stalin, or any of those other leaders were good people. In fact, I think for the most part they were pretty awful people. But the amount of deaths associated with them is completely unfair and ridiculous to propose.

And I want to make one thing perfectly clear, the Nazis were and are not socialists. This is a fairly common idea people have gotten into their heads, but it is completely false and preposterous. It is true that the Nazis call(ed) their ideology National socialism, but really all they did was co-opt the term to gain favor with the working class, among whom the idea of socialism was very popular at the time. The first people persecuted and sent to the camps by the Nazis were socialists, social democrats, and communists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps#Pre-war_camps). The socdems and communists were the largest opposition groups to the Nazi party, and they were dubbed ""enemies of the reich"" after Hitler assumed control.

So, what is socialism? The original, truthful definition of socialism is: an economic system in which the workers own the means of production rather than private parties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism). Communism is a form of socialism which adds these qualifiers to the definition: classless, stateless, and moneyless (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism).

From this we can conclude that ""communist country"" is essentially an oxymoron. Communism cannot exist with the state. The USSR, China, Cuba, etc have never been communist. They haven't even been truly socialist. A better word to describe their economic system is state capitalism, as the means of production are owned by the state. We can also see that there is absolutely no mention of genocide or advocacy of mass murder. In contrast to Nazism, which holds genocide as one of its central tenants. So, was it really communism that killed all those people? Or was it just a few power hungry people taking advantage of their authority, and twisting an ideology to fit their needs?

About the death count you've cited, it's completely unfair and extremely biased. It includes, as one of its biggest contributing factors, famine. You could probably say that bad policy decisions made the famines occur, like in China, but it is a very, very far stretch to say that they intentionally starved their people. It's highly debatable as to whether the Holodomor was intentional or not, although much of the evidence points to intentional famine being unlikely. Famine, especially during that period of time, was very common in capitalist society as well, if not more common than in ""communist"" countries. Colonies of European capitalist powers were often subject to this, like in India, Vietnam, and Persia in the early-mid 1900s. If we used the same methodology as was used to get the 100 million figure, we could blame the UK, France, and capitalism in general as being responsible for tens of millions of deaths around the same time. There's more reasons that 100 million is bullshit, but I'm tired and I've got work tomorrow. I can expand on it more if you want.

One final point, I said tens of millions per year, not total. And that's what's happening in the modern day, not in the past. You could say that capitalism has directly or indirectly causes the deaths of at least hundreds of millions of people since its rise to the norm around the world, if not more.",True,0,1512206443,,False,0,dqng992,False,t3_7gzdie,t1_dqnedls,/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/7gzdie/charlottesville_police_chief_told_cops_to_let/dqng992/,1514262221,7,False,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,t5_2qqdb,public,

Is that even legal in the US ?
In Switzerland where I work it is illegal to lay off a pregnant woman from the first day of pregnancy (even if the woman isn't aware of being pregnant) to the 16th week after delivery, for any reason.

But then I also just realized that maternity leave is unpaid in the US which completely baffled be, this is one of the first time I went to check the references in the wikipedia page because I couldn't believe my eyes... Here we have 16 months of mandatory paid leave and that's considered average in Europe. I was about to say that you could go against them on the ground that they laid off the one person who would be unproductive for 3 months anyway, but that point is moot now.

angryaboutTOWvids,,,"&gt; Russia would have showed no mercy to its neighbors if they did a tiny amount of what Iran, the Syrian regime and Hezbollah are doing. 

What Iran, the Syrian regime and Hezbollah are *doing* (rather than saying)? Does Russia bomb NATO missile installations in Eastern Europe preemptively?

&gt; Israel wouldn't change its behavior that much if it didn't get US backing at the UN. Israel sees the threats it faces as major ones. They can't afford to underestimate its opponents. It's always a fight for survival for Israel. The UN security council condemning Israel would not be a death blow.

It most certainly, most definitely, positively would drastically change how Israel behaves. BDS and international isolation are 2 of its biggest strategic threats. The amount of lobbying they do to avoid that is huge (including pushing a narrative that it won't affect them one bit, so don't even try ^please ^^pretty ^^please ). The path to security Israel has chosen is directly tied to assets available to it (including, but not limited to, European guilt over the Holocaust, US veto in the UNSC, close connections between Israeli and US civil societies which makes lobbying effective, US financial and military aid etc.)

Weapons shipment ban, international isolation and sanctions would not only make it the only existing democratic pariah state, but would make them reassess their strategy as well.

&gt; Unfortunately, the most fertile region in Yemen (the western part) became a net importer of food rather than an export.

What an unfortunate coincidence that has nothing to do with the war they wage.

&gt; Under Saleh, much of land was turned into farming for khat instead of basic food.

When you are a part of world economy, you don't need to produce everything for yourself.

&gt; The whole area is so poorly developed and managed that even if Saudi Arabia would stop bombing the country, there will still be dangers of a famine.

Oh, well, go ahead then. Bomb away.

&gt; If Saudi really had the full backing of the US and was so immoral, they'd use 19 and 20th century strategy by heavily bombing Hodeidah (port city), and completely close any access to North Yemen without letting any food or medicine in. Then there'll be a far worse famine and the death of millions similar to the result of strategies of the past. 

They do what they can. Saudi image on the international stage is of major strategic concern. You know you are in a bad position when the populations of your allies (the UK, the US) are heavily critical of their governments for their involvement.

&gt; Saudi would win the war within a year with a full serious blockade.

KnifeGot10InLonger,,,"&gt;they still destabilise the Middle East,

ME destabilization comes extremely by and large from the Afghan and Iraq wars, the first because it was half-assed in order to give way to the second and the second because it then created a massive power vacuum into which terrorist organizations swept in (there's a reason ISIS is short for Islamic State of **Iraq** and **Syria**) and both of those were the brainchild of a republican president (whose sheer incompetence regarding national security is the reason we had 9/11 and thus the reason to go into Afghanistan in the first place) who then deliberately lied out of his ass to get other people (yes, including democrats) on board. Libya was already a clusterfuck of a civil war by the time the US got involved (and that wasn't by their lonesome, there were also many EU and even other ME countries joining all of who agreed on intervention prior to the start of bombings) as was Syria. Democrats hastened a foregone conclusion (Ghadaffi's removal) whereas republicans created entirely new situations (Saddam's removal and the power vacuums of Iraq and Afghanistan).

&gt;And even within America they back companies and pass laws that damage the American people to benefit big corporations,

Nonsense. The ACA alone was a massive clampdown on the bullshit being pulled by insurance companies and hospitals and only fell short of enacting a full and proper single-payer system because of Independents notorious for their trechery refusing to budge on the issue and the lockstep march of Republicans against it. Likewise with net neutrality, which cut down on telecom abuses that began occurring with more and more frequency in the 2006-2010 period as data packet sniffing to achieve per-site discrimination became viable. Democratic states were the ones that got the ball rolling on marijuana legalization for recreational and medical purposes, which would massively cut into opioid use and other established industries. Democrats ask that corporations pay their fair share in taxes as they reach record profit margins even as they work with said corporations to promote ventures and activities that have a net gain for the whole of society.

Democrats aren't perfect: they're human. Yes, they make mistakes, but they also try and rectify those mistakes. and in the grand scheme of things their policies promote growth and stability. Literally the only reason they haven't been more successful on the federal level over the last 8 years is because republicans literally and explicitly devoted themselves to obstruction the day the Democrats took back power, including the use of gerrymandering and voter suppression, and one need only look at the state level to see the differences: blue states have lower  teen pregnancy and abortion rates, lower poverty rates, higher educational attainment rates and more sustainable economic activity.

Democrats prove that good government is a massive boon for society, and republicans absolutely hate them for it. They don't care if they burn down the entire country in the process, if Democrats end up suffering for their actions they'll gleefully do something despite all evidence indicating it'll be a disaster.",True,0,1512218683,,1512219953,0,dqnkkr1,False,t3_7h18kr,t1_dqnjirn,/r/news/comments/7h18kr/us_senate_passes_sweeping_tax_overhaul_bill/dqnkkr1/,1514264659,0,False,news,t5_2qh3l,public,

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b86f528d1b5b232274a0ceff02c02626.png)  

&gt; Portugal. The Man is an experimental indie rock four-piece centered on frontman John Baldwin Gourley’s abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing. He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley’s innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is always open to interpretation and change. 

&gt; Even though members were born in Alaska, the band formed in Portland, Oregon, USA, in 2004 with the union of Gourley (vocals, guitar, organ, machines) and his childhood friend Zachary Scott Carothers (Bass, percussion, vocals) after the break-up of their band Anatomy Of A Ghost. Jason Sechrist (Drums and Gang) of Portland, OR joined in 2005. Current lineup includes Ryan Neighbors (Piano, Rhodes, Organ, Synth, Vocals). They are however known for fluidity in both their music and their lineup and often feature guest appearances.

&gt; The band’s debut album, Waiter: “You Vultures!” was released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006.

&gt; On June 22, 2007 they released their second full length, Church Mouth. The band then set out on a full US tour with support from The Photo Atlas, Play Radio Play, Tera Melos, and The Only Children. They then toured Europe, and followed it up with another US headlining tour with support from Rocky Votolato and Great Depression during September and October. Following this tour, they joined Thursday on a short east coast tour in November alongside Circle Takes the Square.

&gt; Portugal. The Man collaborated with the band The Sound of Animals Fighting on the re-release of their first album, “Tiger and the Duke.” Portugal. The Man remixed three of the songs on that album.

&gt; On July 30, 2008, it was announced that Portugal. The Man would release Censored Colors under its independent record label, Approaching AIRballoons, with a partnership with EQUAL VISION RECORDS. The album was released September 16, 2008.

&gt; On April 9th, 2009, Portugal. The Man announced a fourth studio album, The Satanic Satanist. It was released on July 21, 2009.

&gt; As of October 2009, It was announced through Twitter that Portugal. The Man have completed another album entitled “American Ghetto” which combines their progressive rock style from their latter albums with some of the electo style from their “Its Complicated Being A Wizard” release. A listening party was held for a group of 17 fans in Los Angeles CA. The album was released on March 2, 2010. 

&gt; The Got it All (This Can’t Be Living Now) Songfacts reports the band’s sixth album and first for Atlantic, In the Mountain in the Cloud, was released on July 19, 2011.

&gt; It was last spring 2012, and John Gourley—frontman of Portugal. The Man—found himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger Mouse’s apartment--a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza—up until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range. 

&gt; When it came time to begin work on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one concept: The most satisfying work is collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had sought partnerships. So he took a bold step — bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty of sound — a step up to the apartment of a possible collaborator, Danger Mouse.

&gt; “I walked into his place,” Gourley remembers now. “And it wasn’t going to happen. He was like, ‘Hey, man, just so you know, I don’t really want to record a rock band.’ And I was a little relieved. We’d done this by ourselves before, and we knew we could do it by ourselves again.”

&gt; But then they got to listening, and to talking about how much Danger Mouse had loved In the Mountain in the Cloud — the 2011 followup to Portugal. The Man’s break out record The Satanic Satanist. “From that very first meeting,” says Danger Mouse, “we were very ambitious about what we could do…otherwise there was no point. So we decided: Let’s try and make something really special.”

&gt; So Danger Mouse — aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and Beck to  The Black Keys  and now U2 —and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began production on what would become Evil Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After all, here was a band with an evolving lineup — Kyle O’Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar/percussion/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar — building new songs with a new producer trying to do something neither of them had done before.

&gt; They went, together, to Los Angeles and worked through several sessions — at Mondo Studios, Eltro Vox Studios, and Kingsize Soundlabs. The band worked months longer than they ever had on one thing. And somehow — maybe it was the collaboration in the air, or maybe sheer will — they finally stopped searching and started realizing: “What really brought our record together was getting past that period of looking for something, and figuring out how to do something really new, really hard, and really satisfying,” said Gourley.

&gt; Each track on Evil Friends is as different from the next as Portugal. The Man’s previous records were from each other, which is to say a piece of a growing mindscape, and wholly a part of the group’s tumbling fever dream. Where the 2009 hit People Say  was a cheery guitar rally, the new title track is a bells-and-balls ballad emerging from darkness into a pipe-whistling punky thump, albeit with Gourley’s trademark falsetto and thundering guitar. And yet here is Evil Friends swirling, like a tornado that sends a napping child toward Oz, into something of a tale of Portugal. The Man’s arousal from when it decided to make something special to when it actually did: The weighted down questions of “Plastic Soldiers” (Could it be we got lost in the summer? / Well I know you know that it’s over) give way to the confident melodies of “Modern Jesus” (The only rule we need is never giving up / The only faith we have is faith in us) and finally, brazenly, to the anthem “Smile” (We watched the sun come up / But took it down to hide it / Seems like the spring has come and gone / It felt like forever).

&gt; It took all year, and Portugal. The Man — a group guaranteed for seven years to pump out a record, to tour and tour and tour, to tuck its fans to bed at night with a community of psychedelic rock — had learned to slow down and transform all-day, all-night recording with Danger Mouse into adrenaline, into words that are at once dark and light, into sounds that are overlapping with danger and charm. The whole “evil friends” thing was just a happy writing accident, by the way, a lyrical coincidence belying a collaborative friendship Burton says taught him, too: “I felt like I was watching them do something special and I wanted to let them do it, so sometimes I was more hands-on, but sometimes more hands-off than I had been with anyone,” says Danger Mouse. “They had done enough albums that I thought it would be fun to shake it up a little bit.”

&gt; “In the beginning, I asked Brian why he had wanted to talk about making a record,” recalls Gourley. “And he admitted that he was surprised when he saw us live. ‘I didn’t know you guys could sound like that.’ There had been this perception that we’ve been something else — and I’ve noticed it, at festivals, everywhere — that we were something we were not. But then we got in a room with Danger Mouse, to the place where we could just throw that out, wake up and say, Here we are. We’re this band! Let’s just make it, together.”
