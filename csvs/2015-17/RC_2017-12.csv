White_Phoenix,,,"It's one of two parts of the argument. 

Race realism is one part - what you just said - that there is a scientific correlation between races and IQ.  This is usually coupled with the correlation that IQ is directly related to tendency for violence.  The lower the IQ, the higher the propensity for violence.

The second part of it is taking this argument, then applying it for white supremacism or white nationalism.  Both of these ""sub"" movements are actually two different entities.

White nationalism usually goes with the saying ""Asia for the Asians, Africa for the Africans, and Europe for the Europeans.""  The argument these folks make is that people have a *tendency* (i.e. bell curve) to group up with people who look like them and act like them.  With most of us in this sub being center-left, we obviously think otherwise, but let's go with this argument.  Even when immigrants migrate to a country, instead of integrating with the population, a lot of them tend to self-segregate themselves into ""communities"" (i.e. Chinatowns and Koreantowns, for example).  For this reason, they argue that rather than forcing people to get along with each other who are of disparate cultures and races, that the races should fuck off back to their original countries of origin because we work better that way.

They use the excuse of race realism to openly discriminate against lower IQ races because they point to crime statistics that back up their argument that these races are inherently *more presupposed* to violence and behavior that is incompatible with Western culture.  Counterarguments made by individualists who say ""But I know (this black guy) and he's nothing like that at all!"" are responded with by pointing out how the bell curve means there WILL be a small population that breaks this trend, but a MAJORITY of that population fall within that IQ range.

How would we do this?  According to white ethno nationalists, they want the government to incentivize non-whites leaving the country.  Not by ""negative"" discrimination, but ""positive"" discrimination - offer them money to leave and relocate back to their country of origin.

Nevermind the fact this expands the power of government and what if people were to refuse?  Yep - you guessed it, they will be FORCED out... authoritarianism in another ideology.

Right-libertarians openly oppose white nationalists because to get the utopia these white nationalists want, they'd have to expand the power of government, which is against libertarian ideals.

White supremacists on the other hand are the strawman that SJWs bitch and whine about.  The ones who think the HUWITE race is the superior race and is responsible for everything positive in today's society.  The ones who openly discriminate against ethnic minorities, and some of them even go to the next level to openly discriminate against Jewish people, arguing the Holocaust is a myth (you might see some of them use the meme of MUH 6 GORILLION) or whatnot and openly will accuse the rest of us of being brainwashed.

The Mississippi Company of 1684 became the Company of the West in 1717, and expanded as the Company of the Indies from 1719. This corporation, which held a business monopoly in French colonies in North America and the West Indies, became one of the earliest examples of an economic bubble.

***

**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

RPGZero,nova,Nova,"&gt;I think we have two different ways of viewing superheroes.

My big problem with your way of thinking is that it's not rooted in any kind of actual philosophies or stated ideologies but is literally, ""this is what I feel, and because I feel it, that's what it is."" You're literally turning progressivism into, ""everything that I agree with, while conservatism is everything i'm uncomfortable with and don't like.""

First off, let's define progressivism in America, which has its roots in using government and laws to change the world, usually through ideas that are considered close to socialism. Sure, people like to define their feelings around it as being against the status quo or being the rebel or whatever, but that's not what progressivism is. That's the point I have been trying to make to you over and over again this entire time and you keep trying to dance around it. You say that i'm using useless semantics. No, i'm not. I'm making a point that you in your zeal to stick to a definition of progressivism that you like to think is the official definition when it really isn't. Progressivism is a poltiical ideology, not some catch all for anyone who wants to change the status quo. Honestly, you sound like someone who is so desperate to be the rebel that you forget this. Your argument is literally, ""N-no, I'M the one whose different, I'M the guy fighting the man, I'M against the status quo, and that's what progressivism is!"" Your entire argument about why Cap is progressive is, ""he likes changes."" It's such a flimsy argument based on a definition of progressivism that is entirely unhelpful and you would never find even in the worst political philosophy handbook.

Spider-Man has responsibility, but he considers it his PERSONAL responsibility. Batman considers his war to be a PERSONAL war. Superman puts his job as something that he sees as a PERSONAL issue due to him having a power no one else has. All of these people do what they do out of a personal mission that arrives out of a personal journey of self-discovery. None of that has anything to do with progressive liberalism. None of that relates to progressivism. None of that even relates to  government. People do good deeds every day, charities exist, etc., much of it occurring without a government dime. In fact, most of the help in America doesn't come from government help, it comes from personal help. 

I mean, this entire debate spun out of Mark Gruenwald's run on Captain America which is literally a run where Cap says he won't be the government's lackey, gives up the costume and shield, and takes on a new identity to continue his personal service to the public. This is Cap, who denied government registration during Civil War because he wanted superheroes to keep operating indepdently. We can go on and on about this. Some of the big storylines having to do with the Justice League are about how the government is wary of their independence, including Grant Morrison's JLA.

You're attempt to mix up personal responsibility and help which to me, is a metaphor for the help we offer to each in the form of every day help, friendship, charity, volunteering, etc. with government paternlism is a mixup I would never, ever mix up with politics and I don't ever see how you could ever derive that from comic books. 

&gt;A libertarian Cap would probably be retired by now. He did his part 100 times over, why would he owe the world anything more? The fact that Cap never stops fighting for those in need suggests to me that he is more progressive than libertarian.

Once again, your arguments are, ""what I like is progressive, what I don't like is not."" You've pretty much consigned all people who are not progressive as being unhelpful, unwilling to help others, selfish, and only self-interested. We're libertarians, not objectivists. Compassion and helping others is not some idea that is somehow a monopoly created by progressives that came into existence when Woodrow Wilson became the Democratic President in the early 1900s. Choosing to help and feeling you owe people is something human beings, political or apolitical, feel everyday. Your argument seems to be, ""well, libertarians believe in the market, so why would they want to help people?"" Are you serious? Are you being serious? You've pretty much exposed everything you believe with this statement. You tried to claim before that you've talked to ""a ton of conservatives"", but quite frankly, you don't know a thing about them. 

Guess what? Communities coming together to help each other, people choosing to be champions of others, people rising to the occasion, charity, and so on existed long before the word ""progressivism"" came into being and it has existed apart from it long after. Much of it was derived from the church and there is still a ton of it that extends from the churches, you know, that institution that often has members who are conservative. On top of that, a lot of this feeling that you owe something more o others exists outside of the urban areas of the country where progressivism is so popular. 

In fact, i'm going to suggest a book to you called, "" Who Really Cares?"" written by a person who was once a liberal but became an independent after he decided to do research on charity, volunteering, and so on in both America and other countries. What he found was that the assumption that, ""progressives talk about helping the poor through government and stereotype conservatives as people who hate the poor"" was turned on its head. It turned out this was a sentiment created by progressives constantly telling themselves that because conservatives didn't feel government should help, and therefore because of that they FELT that conservatives must not want to help others. The truth turned out to be far different. In reality, conservatives were more prone to give to charity and were far more prone to volunteer. This was because conservatives believed that helping the poor should be in the hands of the people, not the government, meaning that they did care, but in their own way, which was through personal responsibility. Alternatively, because progressives cared so much about using the government to help people, they often neglected a personal, self-induced responsibility to help others through charity and volunteering. And it became more telling when he looked at history. When big government laws were passed such as during the war on poverty, personal charity declined (which was only made more sorrowful by the fact that the war on poverty was such a failure). Things became more telling when he looked at Europe which was far more along the socialist lines. It turned out that people there became so dependent on government being the system that helped people that charity was embarrassingly low to non-existent, to the point college professors had to admit some people will lie about how much they give. 

In short, your concept that conservatives and libertarians don't feel they owe the world is ridiculous. I guess cops are all raging liberals, right? And I guess all those guys in the military who want to protect people are all raging progressives, am I right? Ridiculous. If you would actually talk to many conservatives and libertarians, many of them want government shrinkage because a) they feel it would create conditions that would help others as outlined in PLENTY of books written by conservative and libertarian authors, and b) they feel that helping others should be a matter of personal responsibility, not collective government responsibility.",True,0,1512089475,,False,0,dql3yp9,False,t3_7gk10x,t1_dql1c7v,/r/comicbooks/comments/7gk10x/and_get_this_man_a_shield_captain_america_1988_342/dql3yp9/,1514214108,1,False,comicbooks,t5_2qhon,public,

EelKat,Career,Author Home Page: http://www.eelkat.com,"As a reader, I'm not ""tired"" of reading it, but I am however, often saddened by a lack of other settings in Fantasy. I would love to see more Fantasy set in colonial Canada or ancient Persia, for example, but at the same time this does not mean I want less classical Euro-medieval-Fantasy either. I like Fantasy in pretty much any time or place.

I'm always asking questions like: 

* So what was life like for Elves in California when the Gold Rush started? How did they deal with the sudden influx of gold crazed Humans invading? 

* Or what about the Elves of ancient Egypt? Did they live alongside the Humans? Are Elves the mysterious builders of the pyramids? 

* Did Elves build the South American pyramids too? 

* What about the Elves of Transylvania? Did Dracula drink only Human blood or did he go after the Romanian Eves as well? 

* What about Elves in the future? Do they build starships and go to space? What about SteamPunk Elves and CyberPunk Elves? 

* Where were Elves in the 1970s? Did they hang out with hippies? 

* Did the Elves of the 1980s join the glam rock movement? 

* Are Elves today using text-speak on their cellphones? Did Elves ride wagon trains West in the 1800s? 

* Do Elves in modern India star in Bollywood films? 

I want these questions answered. I want to know about the Elves that lived before and after Medieval times and the Elves who live outside of Western Europe. It's not that I want less Medieval Elves, it's that I want to know about ALL Elves every where and every time. I love Elves. I can never get enough Elf stories.

One of the reasons ElfQuest remains to this day, one of my favorite series, is because it took the classic Fantasy Elf, and showed them as living in a more realistic world (realistic in it had eras and countries all over the planet, instead of just 1 time period and 1 country), and thus we saw dark skinned Elves of African tribal settings, bronze skinned Elves of Middle Eastern desert settings with distinctive Jewish &amp; Muslim flavour, and of course the primary characters of the series were the wolf-tribe Elves of Native America that were clearly inspired by pre-Columbian woodland Native American culture.

I wish more authors would write something like ElfQuest, that uses the classic Fantasy races, but shows them in other time periods besides Medieval and other regions outside of Europe. ElfQuest was amazing because you got to see Elves throughout history and from around the world.

xghtai737,,,"It's not that other countries don't have a problem with mass murder, you are just selectively comparing the US to those countries that have less of a problem.

It's not even the whole US that has a problem. On the high side, Puerto Rico has an intentional homicide rate comparable to Columbia; D.C. comparable to South Sudan; Louisiana comparable to the Republic of Congo; Mississippi comparable to Eritrea; and Alabama comparable to Tanzania. 

On the low side, Vermont and New Hampshire are comparable to Sweden; Iowa is comparable to France; Maine is comparable to Belgium; and Massachusetts, Minnesota, Idaho, and Utah are comparable to Canada.

I don't have the statistics on hand, but given the legal friendliness towards guns in New Hampshire and the hostility towards them in D. C., along with the tendency for rural areas to have more guns than urban areas, I have no reason to believe that there are fewer guns per capita in New Hampshire than there are in D. C. So there has to be a factor other than guns to explain why D. C. has a homicide rate more than 10 times greater than New Hampshire.

The US, as a whole, has 4.9 homicides per 100,000 people while the world average is 6.2 per 100,000. Canada, Australia, much of Western Europe, part of Eastern Europe, and parts of Western Asia tend to be below the US and those are the only regions that gun control advocates ever want to compare the US against.

But are the statistical problems gun control advocates need to address: 

* Every country in the world, whether they have a homicide rate above or below the US, has only a fraction of the guns per capita as the US. The US has a homicide rate below the world average. The country with the second most guns per capita (Serbia) has a homicide rate comparable to Sweden and New Hampshire.

* There is a huge differential between high murder rate states in the US and low murder rate states, with no apparent correlation to the number of firearms per capita.

* Firearm laws have become considerably more restrictive in certain other countries and there has been a corresponding decline in murders. However, in the US firearms laws have been very much weakened in recent decades, yet the US has also seen a decline in its murder rate of 50% since 1990.

* His budget uses dynamic scoring - i.e. the numbers don't add up, but he freely assumes that his plan will cause so much economic growth that it will pay for the shortcomings.  This is a lazy man's method; every Republican budget has done this for the last 30 years, but **no Democrat** uses this method because economists don't.  Bernie was the first Dem to use dynamic scoring to massage/cheat his numbers.  His budget added a ton to the deficit otherwise.
* His free college plan is supposed to be paid for by a FTT tax, but he also wanted to implement an FTT tax 5x higher than the largest in the world (France), so high that it would absolutely kill all day-trading.  You can't kill day trading *and* calculate the income based on assuming people keep day trading.  Sweden tried a similar experiment and it was a disaster and barely raised income (because people stopped trading on Swiss markets).  Repealed in a year.


* His Medicare for All numbers were pretty fudged to assume lower costs and higher tax revenue, [most economists think they will add a lot to the debt.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-health_us_56b25e8fe4b04f9b57d83008)

* A $15 minimum wage *at federal level* is a bad idea; the vast majority of economists think so.  [No country in the world has anything close to it.](http://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/top-10-national-minimum-wages-in-the-world/index.html)  A lot of our big cities would be fine with a $15 federal minimum wage, but a lot of rural areas would be crippled by it.  There's many much better ways to help the poor- for example, tax the rich more and pay a negative income tax to everyone, or an EITC (negative income tax based on hours worked), or even just pro-union laws (Denmark achieves high wages through unionization, not minimum wage).  A higher minimum wage is generally agreed by economists as the worst way to increase wages.

* Bernie's ideas on free trade were childlike and about as educated as Trump's.  He fell apart in interviews when pressed; he hated all trade deals and said they were bad, but could not identify *what part* of them he didn't like or how he would fix them or anything besides ""I hate all trade deals"".   He couldn't even explain what a good trade agreement looks like.

* A *very, very* large number of left-wing economists wrote and signed letters criticizing Bernie's budget for being irresponsible.  I can only think of two economists who actually endorsed Bernie- Gerald Friedman and Robert Reich- and the latter pretty much admitted he's  endorsing Bernie because I think single payer is great, not because the numbers add up.  However, Bernie fans upvoted so many articles about Gerald Friedman (from University of Mass.) that I think people thought a lot of economists were supporting Bernie, not just Gerald.

* Bernie couldn't even explain the effects of many of his policies.  For example, he wanted desperately to break up the big banks as punishment; but when pressed on ""What would be the economic result of breaking up the big banks?"" he had absolutely no idea.  He wants to punish the banks out of anger, but has no actionable idea of what it will accomplish?






**I like** Bernie's message of ""we can do what Europe does!""

But **none of his actual stated plans** resemble how Europe achieves what they do, except for single-payer.  European countries don't put 1% round trip taxes on stock trades, or $15 federal minimum wages.  They're pro-union, progressive taxation, and *pro free trade*.


Bernie always picked up on simple, layman-understandable policies that were actually terrible way to achieve what he wanted to.  $15 minimum wage is easier to understand than negative income tax. 
 And he'd happily endorse stupid things Europe doesn't do (like hating 
 trade agreements) if it was popular with the layman.

MMfuryroad,,Chane A5 towers/Rythmik LV12R sub/BIC PL-66 surrounds/Denon 2805,"&gt;Fair enough, just to clarify a couple points-

&gt;The Toyota/Lexus comparison was on purpose. Klipsch/Audiovox owns Jamo, just like Toyota owns Lexus. The only reason I got into that is you were using the pricepoint as evidence of a lack of quality, and I was trying to point out that the initial price of these guys was WAY above the Klipsch Reference. A better comparison might have been Holden Commodore/Chevy SS vs. Chevy Malibu.

I get the idea behind the comparison now but Toyota invented Lexus using its own existing technology and design teams. Klipsch acquired JAMO as a wholly owned subsidiary around 2005 or so to have more extension into Europe but they have their own design teams and sound signatures. That last one is better although I think their getting rolled into Opel in 2018. I get your points but I still don't get caught up too much in MSRP's with speakers.  They can be whatever the manufacture wants them to be and markups in them seem to vary widely. Maybe I'm wrong on that and there's a logical percentage to them like automobiles but I haven't seen much evidence of it. 

&gt;Again with the price, I don't think that materials cost or R&amp;amp;D has anything to do with pricing on these guys. I think that this was purely an attempt to clear out space in a warehouse and maybe avoid paying Amazon's massive holiday storage fees. I would be shocked if the pricing rules from Jamo are way different than Klipsch (both owned by Audiovox). My guess is that Klipsch (or some distributor) ended up with a small batch of units and they got moved to ASD for pennies on the dollar, at which point ASD rolled them over in attempt to pick up nickel or a dime. 

You could very well be right on that. Big companies seem to love losing money for the tax breaks.

&gt;I also want to clarify that I'm legitimately happy that you like your system, and I believe you that the Bic is a good match, and I also think that the Jamo is unlikely to be a good match.

J_S_Han,,,"Displacements? We don't know for sure since the navy is busy building up its frigates, destroyers, and subs for now for the immediate foreseeable years. Your guess is as good as mine. 

As for stationing more fighter squadrons, it's inefficient in terms of logistics. Sure, you might save a bit of money not developing the carriers and maintaining them, but you lose valuable time in rapid deployment for air support and the means to supply them. Most of South Korea and Japan's potential military enemies are all located near one another (China, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and Russia's Far East detachment). The fact remains that carriers are far more likely to be ready to respond to overseas conflicts compared to fixed air bases (and more importantly, are more mobile.) A 20, 30 minute difference in deployment might mean the difference between a tactical victory with your forces intact or complete defeat, especially with the prevalence of long ranged air to air and air to ground weapons being developed/used in Asia.

Let me give a better example: South Korea does not need nuclear submarines, if you were to put it in absolute terms, to defend against not only North Korea or even Japan and China for a conventional war. The problem is the developments of nuclear SLBMs by North Korea and China's increasing belligerence, which increases the likelihood of submarines becoming an existential threat, meaning it won't be enough to detect most of track most of your enemy's subs - you need to track all, and in the event of failure, be able to intercept them. Nuclear submarines are simply better equipped than conventional subs in terms of tracking systems, armament, and even stealth (acoustics) if you're willing to spend more. The natural geography of the Korean peninsula (numerous reefs, pockets of gases, etc) also makes it easy for subs to hide, which is why the current South Korean government (a known hawk) is so adamant on continuing its nuclear submarine project.

And in another matter, South Korea also doesn't need ballistic missiles or cruise missiles to defeat North Korea. But it expedites its operational timetables and makes things easier, which is why South Korea opted to spend the extra amounts from its defense budget to develop them.

It's about maximizing your capabilities against existential threats with what you can, and not about getting the most cost effective method.

As for your final comment - strictly speaking, it's the other way around for carrier necessity. Based on future economic potential and buildup of a massive arms race as well as territory tensions in Asia, it's actually Korea and Japan who have more tangible reasons to seek out aircraft carrier rather than the U.K. or France, whom have still largely cut back on their military spending even in parts of the armed forces to this day due to an overall increased stability in Europe compared to the Cold War. Neither France nor the UK hold **large** territory disputes with one another, nor are any of their nearby neighbors severely increasing their military development. And they certainly don't have to deal with rapidly increasing strategic - i.e. nuclear - assets by various countries in the **immediate** vicinity (Russia, China, North Korea).",True,0,1512091161,,1512100916,0,dql5d1o,False,t3_7g2u82,t1_dqklbnd,/r/korea/comments/7g2u82/한국해양안보포럼_does_south_korea_need_aircraft_carriers/dql5d1o/,1514214869,2,False,korea,t5_2qiog,public,

Esto no funcionó ni siquiera en Suecia, donde los niveles bajaron abruptamente... !!!. Ahora imaginen todas las bonitas teorías (el alumno construye su aprendizaje) en ambiente de niños ultra-dependientes, con padres de un nivel cultural paupérrimo en los cuales no van a existir incentivos para realmente construír esos aprendizajes y a eso súmenle la cruzada de los teóricos constructivistas contra la autoridad (no autoritarismo, no confundir) de los docentes...

Oh fuck off France. French and British imperial interests and willfully criminal foreign policies lead to the ousting of Qadaffi who at least provided some stability to the country and co-operated with detaining sub-Saharan African migrants in Libya before they could attempt to reach Europe from Libyan shores. The lawless mess that Franco-british intervention ushered in lead to a failed state run by warring jihadist factions and the addition of hordes of Libyans fleeing Africa as the West created another failed state. Now France wants other Europeans to die to clean up their mess? Gee isn't being part of the French-German empire so great for non Germanic and non-French speaking countries? All downsides, no upsides. Many European nations literally have nothing in common and French interests in Africa are against most European interests, especially frontline states to the massive refugee hordes like Greece, Italy, Spain. The interests of highly export oriented mercantilist states Germanic Europe are against the interests of most of Europe. Why does most of Europe care that Germanic exports are protected unfairly from cheaper Chinese or other Asian competition? The interests of Balkan states, Eastern/Central European states with no imperialist history is not the same as the former big imperial powers of Europe like Germany/Austria, France, the UK(exiting anyway), especially Germany/Austria which dedicated themselves mostly to intra-European imperialism that has repercussions today.

WearsSensibleShoes,,,"Real Social Skills was originally a tumblr aimed at helping autistic people navigate social shit-eg, when someone asks you ""how are you"" they are expecting an answer along the lines of ""just fine, thanks for asking"". 

The was drama (of course) and [realersocialskills](http://realersocialskills.tumblr.com/) started reblogging realsocialskills with critique of the advice and their own advice. They stopped a few years ago after a few posts praising realsocialskills for having made consistently good posts.

The Formal SJ Rules as articulated in that post are pretty copacetic with what I've heard and read in both meatspace (smallish public liberal art school with several conservatories for theater, dance, music, art, etc) and online (woke/sjw tumblr)

I think the depiction is accurate, and I used to agree with it fiercely. I agree with it much less these days, and tend to avoid putting myself in situations where that model of thought is likely to be put on a pedestal.

The intent, I think, is that people who are often the subject of study are frequently not the people who are listened to regarding issues they may face. The idea is that cishetwhitechristianneurotypical men are the ones who study and write papers on LGBT, ethnic minorities, mental illness, etc, and that a panel is much more likely to ask a cishet white guy to speak about poverty among LGBT African Americans than an LGBT African American. 

The premise of ""shut up and listen"" is that lived experience trumps everything else. Even if a white guy studies AA culture extensively, nothing he has to say can possibly be more important than *anything* that any AA person has to say. (This obviously has the side effect of turning the one AA person in the room into the speaker for *all* AA people, which... yeah.)

Now, historically and currently, marginalized people are ignored. Health, crime, history, culture-if you weren't the right kind of white, your opinion didn't matter. See: any fucking polar exploration undertaken by white european guys who never thought to ask native people in the area how to not die of frostbite. 

BUT, being black doesn't make you an expert on black culture. Being gay doesn't mean you know all of LGBT history. Being mentally ill doesn't mean you understand mental illness beyond your own personal illness. PLUS, shocker, people disagree, and some lesbians think that trans women are women and some lesbians think that trans women are men trying to invade women's spaces.

NoFanOfTheCold,,,"&gt;You're making it a gulf. Realistically people are not arrested for saying the word ""nigger"" in the UK or anywhere. They are arrested for threatening people, berating them, belittling them.

Arresting someone for belittling someone is the far far side of the gulf.  I didn't create that gulf the English people did.  But in all fairness, it seems to be a common sort of surrendering of freedom across much of western Europe.

&gt;Realistically there is not much difference between arresting someone for threatening to kill them, but not actually doing it, and threatening someone by screaming at them to go home and go away.

Yes there is a monstrous difference.  A night and day difference.  One is a threat, and one is not.  It isn't any more complicated than that.

&gt;Both create hate

Sure..someone yelling at you to go home and go away makes you hate them I suppose.  I don't see how that has a fucking thing to do with the discussion at hand, but cool...I will agree with this point.  (although in the interest of full disclosure, if you are so incredibly weak that you give my words the agency to control how you feel, to bring you to the level of blind hatred...you are frankly contemptible anyway.)

&gt;both are somewhat of a threat to an individual

No they are not, that is why you described them differently...one is a threat, one is not.  This bizarre notion now being embraced by intellectually dishonest and weakminded fools across the globe that anything you don't like should make you feel afraid for your life is beyond idiotic.

&gt;The level of threat is slightly reduced, yes, but not significantly.

Yes, it is completely and utterly, because the second scenario you painted WAS NOT A THREAT.  Words mean things for God's sake.

&gt;You make a mountain out of a molehill.

You just said not threatening someone was threatening someone...you are the one building mountains (of stupidity) here.

&gt;If you want to take your ideology far enough, I could argue that if I'm saying I want to kill someone, it's not a threat unless I do anything

And you'd never win the argument...again...words have meanings, care to step out really quick and google the definition of the word ""threat""?  I can wait.

&gt;therefore it should not be against the law to say something like that

If you would argue that threatening someone with violence should be perfectly permissible, I would have to disagree with you.

&gt;So realistically, what's the difference?

An Audi A4 and a persimmon, realistically what is the difference?  (hint: they are two completely different things.  did that help?)

&gt;Why do you disagree with the argument going SLIGHTLY one way, but also SLIGHTLY the other way? 

I'll be completely honest...I don't have the slightest idea what you are trying to ask me here.  I speak English and I know what the words mean, but I don't understand what you are trying to string together here.  Could you rephrase it please?

&gt;Why is your ideology the perfect, golden point in the morally grey area?

I don't accept that it is a morally gray area.  And I never once said the American view on Freedom of Speech was perfect.  I have said several times now, that if your version works for you I am very happy for you.  I would find your version stifling, oppressive, and yes fascist.  Do I think ours is perfect? No...but I don't expect perfection from life, and certainly not the law.  Do I think ours is better for most Americans?

• Players at the World Championships or International Championships may use game cards from any region or market.

North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

The nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. Investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene.

Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called ISIS, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

A report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

The FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the airwaves auction.

AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products. 

During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.",True,0,1512096706,,False,0,dqlaa1c,False,t3_7ekt23,t1_dq61ott,/r/Jokes/comments/7ekt23/calm_down_about_the_net_neutrality_thing/dqlaa1c/,1514217683,1,False,Jokes,t5_2qh72,public,

This might be a bit of a semantic point, but lots of the German officer corps that was pushing for war did not necessarily think that the war was a good idea on its own terms, but rather that the war was inevitable, and since it was inevitable it was better for Germany that it happen now rather than later.

sonnuvabitch,texas-flag,Texas,"Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[99] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.

Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-Soviet states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations(originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4 billion.[69] The OSI says it has spent about $500 million annually in recent years

Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects—$100 million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50 million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa—noting that Soros had given $742 million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7 billion.[177]

Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of €420 million to the Central European University (CEU). The Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus and his microfinance bank Grameen Bank received support from the OSI.[citation needed]

Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary(1984–89)[14] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[181] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600 million a year.[3][182]

On 17 October 2017 it was announced Soros has transferred ~$18 billion to Open Society Foundation [183]

&gt; Suzi Quatro (born Susan Kay Quatro, June 3, 1950, Detroit, Michigan) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality, and actress. Suzi grew up in the States, experiencing the rock and roll revolution as it happened. She became an icon of the 70s glam rock era with her 'bad girl' image that went on to influence other female acts that arose in her wake, including The Runaways and L7. Known as ""The Wild One"" for her song of the same name, Suzi has prominently played the American originals of songs only meekly covered by British artists and many original rock classics, songs not allowed to escape onto the British airwaves of her airwaves due to the BBC's control.

&gt; A talented singer and bass guitarist, trained in classical piano and percussion, she joined her sisters in the 60s Detroit garage rock group The Pleasure Seekers whilst still in her teens and never looked back. By the early 70s, Suzi went off to England to work with producer Mickie Most, while her sister Patti joined the all-woman rock band Fanny. An underground following spread around Suzi's charisma and powerful singing.

&gt; Suzi found herself singing the material of songwriting duo Chinn &amp; Chapman, musicians who were also having hits with Sweet. Combining shades of bubblegum pop with a hard rock spirit, similar to the power pop ethos of the era, Suzi embraced the glam sound. Under their tutelage, she had four top ten rock hits in the U.K., but she remained mostly unknown in the U.S. 

&gt; However, her U.K. fame expanded through the 70s, with Suzi becoming a successful solo singer, bassist, and songwriter with a string of charting hits. Her appeal extended into the 80s while many of her contempoaries broke up. Notable songs of his period include ""Can The Can"", ""Devil Gate Drive"", ""Tear Me Apart"", and ""The Wild One"", among many others.

&gt; Suzi extended her career to television in 1979 when she guest starred for three seasons on the hit television series 'Happy Days'. She played the character Leather Tuscadero, who was the younger sister of Fonzie's love interest, Pinky Tuscadero. In 1979, at the height of the disco era, she finally made the U.S. Top Five with the track ""Stumblin' In"", a duet with Chris Norman.

&gt; In her musical career she has had 16 hit singles, sold over 45 million records and toured since 1964. She has also had guest appearances in the Runaways documentary ""Edgeplay"" and various UK television shows including Minder, Dempsey And Makepeace and Absolutely Fabulous. 

&gt; In 1990, Suzi trod the boards in London's West End playing the lead in the musical Annie Get Your Gun and wrote and starred in a musical about Talullah Bankhead. 

&gt; Suzi continues to write, perform and record her own original material and has a forthcoming new album Naked Under Leather. She also hosts an excellent show on BBC Radio 2.

&gt; 
Quatro's first single ""Rolling Stone"" did not achieve popularity anywhere except Portugal, where it made number one. Most introduced Quatro to the songwriting and production team Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman. Her second single ""Can the Can"" (1973) was a number one hit throughout Europe and in Australia. It was followed up by three further hits: ""48 Crash"" (1973), ""Daytona Demon"" (1973) and ""Devil Gate Drive"" (1974) on RAK Records. Her first two albums were also European and Australian successes.

&gt; These recordings, however, met little success in her native U.S., despite tours in the mid-1970s supporting Alice Cooper, and, except in Australia, the popularity of Quatro's rocking glam rock declined from 1975. In the interim, she did enjoy success as a session player.

&gt; Quatro's fortunes did not change until 1978 when ""If You Can't Give Me Love"" became a hit in the UK and Australia. This did nothing to prompt Stateside success, but ""Stumblin' In"", a duet recorded that same year for RSO Records with Chris Norman of Smokie secured a #4 peak in the U.S. Both tracks featured on the ""If You Knew Suzi"" album. A year later, Quatro released ""Suzi... And Other Four Letter Words"". She called it her favourite album. This featured singles, such as ""She's In Love With You"", which made number 11 in the UK , ""Mama's Boy"" (34) and ""I've Never Been In Love"" (56). In 1980, her song ""Rock Hard"" was featured on the soundtrack of the cult film Times Square, along with some punk and new wave bands like Talking Heads, Ramones, XTC and The Pretenders. This success period proved brief however, and her last UK hit was ""Heart of Stone"" in late 1982. In 1985 Quatro collaborated with Bronski Beat and members of The Kinks, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and Dr Feelgood on the Mark Cunningham-produced version of David Bowie's classic ""Heroes"", released the following year as the 1986 BBC ""Children In Need"" single.

&gt; In December 2005, a documentary chronicling Quatro's life, ""Naked under leather"" directed by former Runaway Victory Tischler Blue appeared. In February 2006, Quatro released ""Back To the Drive"", produced by Sweet guitarist Andy Scott. The album's title track was penned by her former collaborator Mike Chapman.

&gt; March 2007 saw Quatro release a version of The Eagles' ""Desperado"", followed by the publication of her autobiography, ""Unzipped"".

&gt; Suzi Quatro has sold over 45 million records.

dreamwaverwillow,,,"why are all big superhero films in english when mandarin, spanish and arabic are pretty damn popular?

1)  because white guy speaking english, everyone just falls into looking at the character and not the race of the actor or the language. *

2) obviously english is the globalised worlds' lingua franca now.

*Its an interesting area that merits discussion as to why that is. the left will give some reasons, and the right will give theirs.

I mean why does almost  all japanese manga and anime depict women like russian and scandinavian girls but with brightly coloured hair and big eyes and big breasts even though generally none of those traits relate to the japanese themselves that well? 

You'll get the weaboo counterargument of ""well if you knew about anime the art style they use for western white characters is slightly different to japanese characters particularly with respect to the eyes"" but its like cmon dude the culture of these animes will be distinctly and richly japanese but the looks are clearly european influenced. 

There are countless anime and manga inspired by germanic and british monarchy type influences. gothic or regal comes up time and time again.

You can go to eastern europe or ukraine  and see women that look like they could be anime characters. 

I am a person of colour [hate using that term but in this weird ""label first"" world it helps to avoid accusations of racism] and british but i think strangely about things too.

For example when jon boyega got cast as the co-lead for star wars force awakens i absolutely loved it, was fully on board with it, psyched for him, wanted a black lead, and even wanted a light interracial romance with him and rey. 


when people keep saying idris elba should be bond i hate that argument, to me growing up as a brown kid brit with bond films and the books, i have always had it in my head as bond as a white character. 

if they made a black Bond you'd have to include so much screen time on the racism he'd get while on the job as a spy operating within shadier parts of the rest of the world.

I mean to me casting idris would be as mad as casting Dev patel as bond ""i'd be like he looks like me but... no mate""


And therein lies the rub, because people can think that its a uniquely ""white person"" thing to have everything acting wise default to them but it really is so much more complex than that, rise of multiple factors including hollywood dominance and global culture.


other weird things i've noticed as a poc and a  film fan:

love Boyega as co-lead of force awakens

hate idris being pushed for bond

love idris as heimdall [needs a spinoff!]

hate new maryjanewatson as a antifa poc stereotypical #resist college person

Noltonn,,,"The Room is a pretty big cult classic. Its story is all over the place, the acting is bad, the lines are bad, and the editing just horrid. In certain scenes it's painfully obvious it's been redubbed in a different place. 

Tommy Wisseau is the writer, director and lead actor of the monsterpiece and he's a very strange character. There's been rumours flying about how he afforded to make the movies, some people are convinced he's DB Cooper. On top of that he seems to have some kind of speech impediment and a strange eastern Europeanesque accent, and very little is known about him. From what I hear it's basically been confirmed he had a brain injury when he was younger, and he got his money from San Fransisco real estate. He also made a ton of bad choices while making the movie, like buying the cameras instead of renting them as movies usually do. And he's apparently horrible to work with, having to reshoot some of the scenes dozens of times. Tons of weird scenes like a excruciatingly long sex scene where he appears to be fucking a chick's belly button. This scene gets replayed in a slightly different cut later in the movie, with the same footage, because the woman refused to shoot another sex scene with the man.

A while after the movie was released, the co-star wrote a book about all of this, called The Disaster Artist. I haven't read it but it's apparently filled with weird shit like this. Then, Franco decided it would be fun to make a moving following the events described in this book.

It really dismays me that so many people are brainwashed into hating guns because it's pretty clear when you hear their arguments that they aren't even sure why they hate guns themselves. All they can do is robotically spit out the same boring talking points over and over. 

Alcohol is **objectively** worse than guns. But it's not political. There's no smug pricks on the internet crying about their shitty country and how ever since it banned booze it's had the fewest rapes and DUIs and child sexual assault cases. There's no smug dicks from Europe that come over and cry on the air about how we won't give up our booze.

ManBooble,,,"Thomas Jefferson also lived in a time where this manner of thinking was prevalent. You think you're telling me something new that the founders and others thought of themselves as superior to other races. Of course they did. Jefferson owned slaves, for fucks sake. I specifically said that equality under the law was later expanded/developed upon to encompass -all- people. That doesn't mean that the founders or the people who thought this way of that time period were ""right"" any more than the people who were certain that the earth was flat were ""right"" when it was later proven it wasn't. You're telling me that the people of colonial America thought of themselves as superior to blacks and the indigenous. You may as well tell me that water is wet. Their entire world view was centered around their own culture, as is EVERY person's from their own culture compared to another's especially in times as this when they were more starkly isolated. Human beings have inherent xenophobic tendencies because our social structures evolved to focus around our family, tribal, and racial/cultural/ethnic groups, but HAVING that tendency does not bring truth to the claim that people are unequal in the IDEA that they have ""god given potential"" within the context of their environment. A western born person of any color can excel according to their own merit given the resources their cultural context provides. There are, of course, constrains within certain socio-economic factors (a man born into riches clearly has an advantage but he may also not be very capable, whereas a poor man may have the tenacity to excel beyond his status)... but typically a western man will grow to exhibit behavior fostered by his culture, where a man in subsaharan africa will grow to exhibit the behavior fostered by *his* culture and set by the limitations of his environment (via resource access) that cannot be overcome by merit-driven progress. Why is it you think that people are not born equal of potential when clearly we have people who have succeeded within the contexts of their own culture, by their own merit, of every race and creed? 

Or are you saying because Jefferson didn't understand that when you have a population of blacks that were deliberately kept from access to education, who were subject to generations of enslavement and a life of labor and servitude, that this has very real and lasting effects (damage) to the development in mental health and cognition? That even before that, they came from an area of the world and a culture which had no access to resources that permitted the advancement technologically to be on par with Europe at this time? And yet somehow in the modern world, with the growing equalization of access to resources and education, some of the brightest people in the world are blacks/non-whites (scientists, etc.). But if you had kept them in the same status as they were in Jefferson's times, you would find the results not to be much different from what he described. To say nothing that you find similar ""dimness"" in people of exceptional poverty even in the developed world for their lack of access to beneficial resources such as good nutrition, reasonable work, and education.

You are absolutely lost on this subject and the causes for these differences. Out of your depth, and frankly, confused on basic meanings and interpretations. I urge you, if you're in college, maybe try to get some access to some anthropological courses, for that entire FIELD is dedicated to the study of human beings, their differences, and the causes for these differences.

While the government functions normally, violent crime remains a constant, creating a climate of fear (anarchy). He says that “laws that are supposed to protect ordinary citizens against ordinary criminals” routinely go unenforced, even though the state is “perfectly capable” of doing so. While this problem rages on, government elites concentrate their interests on law-abiding citizens.

If by we you mean ""white people"" then absolutely. We're not prone to sudden outbursts or rash anger in the slightest. We're rather reserved, all things being equal. You need only look upon the patience of European nations with their, shall we say, ""demanding guests"" to see that writ very plainly. If by we you mean ""third world invaders"" and ""Muslims"" though? Why, they're like fire crackers by a campfire... liable to go off at the slightest change of breeze.

gar37bic,,,"The usual Bernie Sanders fantasy politics game. Lord preserve us from national politicians!

 1. The Marshall Plan involved primarily _loans_ to European nations after WWII, and the money had to be spent on US goods and equipment. This drove the manufacturing boom and economic bubble in the US in the 1950s - for example, the European purchases of Caterpillar equipment turned it into a global brand. I don't see how anything but the positive connotations of the name has any benefit to PR - loans are not the answer.

 2. If the US Government pays off the PR debt, several states (California, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut for starters) that are in as bad or worse condition will have a justification to ask for bailouts of their fiscal disasters. This would cost the US Government over $1 trillion. And then there are thousands of counties and municipalities in similarly bad condition - NYC, Chicago, LA, ... So, bottom line - the US Government _will not_ and _can not_ simply bail out PR by writing checks without causing a catastrophic chain reaction.

What the US _can_ do is twofold:

 1. continue to provide the executor (hated Promesa?) to assist in restructuring the debt - this is a common method globally - in such a way that PR has an actual possibility of paying it off, given a healthy economy. That brings to ...

 2. Modify the federal laws in several ways to encourage re-investment and restoration of the PR economy. Possibilities include

 - restoring the 1978-2005 tax breaks for companies moving manufacturing to PR - PR is still the 4th largest pharma producer in the world, and produces _all_ the Tylenol for instance. Some medical devices are still made in PR as well.

 - a partial exemption to the Jones Act, similar to Alaska. This is unlikely due to federal politics

 - alternatively, pass an exemption to tariffs on imported materials for products manufactured in PR. For example, at present there is a 30% tariff on all Chinese solar panels and solar cells. If that tariff were exempted for solar cells that became part of solar panels produced in PR, that could drive jobs in PR.

PR also has a large suite of excellent tax provisions to encourage moving business - everything from manufacturing to finance - to PR, as well as moving personally. So there is a lot that people in PR can do. For instance, the Jones Act essentially doubles the cost of shipping between PR and the US mainland. But it has zero effect on shipping between PR and every other country. So PR can develop a regional trade economy, buying and selling with Caribbean and Latin American nations as well as Europe. Many products sold in PR originate in China, are shipped to the mainland, then shipped again to PR. PR could work with Chinese businesses and global shipping companies to include PR in their non-US delivery routes. This would cut the cost of almost anything manufactured outside the US, and would enable PR to become a regional shipping hub, possibly using Roosevelt Roads as a cargo-only distribution center for the whole region.

I've also noticed that many (most?) products in the grocery store are over priced. This IMHO is caused not by the often-blamed Jones Act directly but simply a relative monopoly by food and other suppliers who are taking advantage of the limited number of shippers. Or maybe the grocery store chains are too concentrated?

PR entrepreneurs need to get on the ball and start working on alternative sources of goods, and start competing. Find or create another shipper besides Crowley. Too many people in PR seem to be either complacent or resigned and fatalistic. An entrepreneur sees a problem and then does what it takes to create a solution. Why are chicken wings three times as expensive here as on the mainland?

What *is*, then?

&gt; It means he shouldn't be allowed in because Britain is for the British and only indigenous Europeans can be British.

Hahahaha. For starts, the mayor of London is a Muslim Pakistani. The UK indeed has a vast majority of whites, but millions of people there *aren't*. It's not illegal for a non-white to live there. This isn't even a point, you're basically fantasizing at me.

&gt; Because I actually fucking value my people. 

If you don't want to fuck immigrants, that's your choice. Give the hard labor to them so your race can get higher paying jobs, how's that for a destiny? I mean, of course that sort of segregation can't last forever what with the advent of automation, but the reason Detroit failed isn't because blacks were in it, it's that the labor moved to immigrants and foreigners. Surely you won't want your fellow white man in that position?

&gt; Because heterogeneity is incapable of producing a functioning society.

Heterogeneity only fails because people don't extinguish that tribal wariness. In Switzerland, for instance, the Flemish and Walloons hate each other. But look at USA. We're kinda fucked at the moment, but we're no anarchy. Most people here who *aren't* advocating for a nation state love the hell out of race mixing, because they don't want to be bigoted. 

There's gotta be that social pressure, combined with personal experience with other ethnicities, to make that work, and eventually it becomes a genuine lack of instinctual bigotry. I understand that America is somewhat of a special case in that regard, but that is exactly because of our massive immigration over the years. The reason this isn't working with Europe's migrant crisis is that they're not assimilating the migrants well enough. Assimilation seems to be what you fear happening over here for whites, but that's just the way this country works. Only this time, thankfully, it's illegal to discriminate against you while it's happening. (Of course, again, you could just not talk to immigrants yourself if you so desire.)

The gap between the Visegrad Group (V4) and the countries that are in the EU continues to deepen, ""Schwarz adds, adding that one reason The fact that the Hungarians and the Poles, and recently also the Czechs, ""have ceased to choose as the West wants.""

Schwarz notes that Viktor Orban's Hungarian Prime Minister is often mentioned in the West with the Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Poland does not suffer this because of the nationalist conservatism under the influence of Catholicism, and the secular Czechs are asked with surprise as to why they chose the Slovakian billionaire Prime Minister.

According to commentator Andrej Babisz, he won the election as the current president of France Emmanuel Macron - with a movement directed at traditional parties, which - he notes - is called populism. **""Only the pragmatism of Babis power is considered a populist, while Macron is considered a politician who has saved his country from populism,"" critically acclaims the author.**


Addressing the problem of migration, the commentator points to a completely different interpretation of the concept of ""solidarity"" in the west and east of the EU. **Most EU countries have agreed to the allocation of refugees as ""an order of European solidarity"", while the Visegrad Group countries interpret solidarity as ""the EU's commitment to defend Europe against mass migration from Africa and Asia"".**

**From the point of view of V4, not Merkel is promoting solidarity, but Orban** - says Schwarz. The threat of cutting EU funds increases only the resistance of these countries aggainst the quotas  - he adds.

According to Schwarz, the ""new self-esteem"" of countries in eastern Central Europe is based on two premises - material and ideological. ""Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are thriving economies,"" says Schwarz. The EU is perceived as ""less and less as a chance, more and more as a ball"", he notes.

As he stresses, ""people's minds"" are more important, who have been twice exposed to the ""long march"" to be the ""new man"".

The inhabitants of these countries were firstly ""victims of communist civil engineers"" and then subjected to ""neo-liberal planners from the EU and the IMF."" **After the turnout in 1989 the local Communists ""quickly adapted to the new times"", but continued a long march instead of ""more socialism"" postulating now ""more Europe"", writes the commentator.**

""The realities of people living with traditional values ​​- family, nation and religion - treated relics as doomed to death, just like the bourgeoisie and peasantry,"" reads FAZ.

""In Central and Eastern Europe inhabited by self-confident nations, this long march has reached a temporary end. A new era, full of hope and dangers, has begun,"" concludes Schwarz in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

ChaosCowboy,,Unironic Bernie Sanders Rally Attendee,"Yeah I agree on the whole Marxism reproduction thing, I'm just not so sure about the ""vast Jewish conspiracy"" this board is in love with. Sure, the sleazy Jewish shyster stereotype exists for a reason. But I feel that the vast majority of the Jews involved in propagating the philosophy of cultural Marxism (the blue check mark crowd) are just as duped as the soyboy whites that do it. They've bought into it because of the ""morally superior selflessness"" deal. I think Marx and Engels themselves were most likely of that mind rather than some sort of ""Deep State Future-Zionist think tank""

If we're talking about Zionism, I think the ex-IDF Israeli Nationalist is in a completely different mindset, and intent, than the new york jewish writer cranking out hit pieces on imaginary nazis. The Israeli being a guy doing what he believes is best for his country, not so far removed from me in some ways, and the new yorker being a decadent pleasure-seeker deep in the clutches of self-immolation at the hands of this new wave of, for lack of a better term, post modernist weakness.

It's like, you see these post WWII israelis, and most of the Jews out of modern Israel, guys like Moshe Dayan, who have more in common with pre-1900s Jewish boxers, and compare that to the stereotypical ""travelling jew"" in hollywood and NY, like Woody Allen or Seinfeld or our ol' buddy Blockhead Joe, and they don't even look like they're from the same culture, not the same race even. In college I talked to a lot of African dudes, who almost universally had a disdain for American Blacks, because of radically different mindsets. They didn't look alike, they didn't talk alike, they didn't think alike, and they wanted nothing to do with each other. That's the same level of divergence I see with Jews. Which is not to say ""not all jews"", but more to say that there are entirely opposed schools of thought within Jewish communities to the point that they are not one community. 

I guess I'm not sold on the general Jewish belief in Jewish Supremacy. The key question in these circles is ""open borders for Israel?"" The Zionist/Israeli Nationalists are going to say hard no, galils at the ready. Most of the ultra sad, nihilist destruction of western civilization neo-liberal types I've talked to, *Jewish or not, but def. including Jews*, will go on endlessly about ""the plight of the Palestinian people"" and ""ending apartheid"". 

These people, in my mind, are part of a Marxist push to basically destroy civilization in the name of equality, including their own promised land, including their own adopted homelands. Jew or not, it's the idea not the Ethinicity, Race, ect. I don't see the connection between Marxism and Jewish Supremacy, because if the Marxists achieve their goals, the Jews get their shit pushed in just as hard as whites and everyone else. The fact that these sort of neo-liberal, cultural marxist, anti-white advocate ""fellow white people"" types are so fuckin' frequently Jewish I don't see as a Jewish Supremacist conspiracy(largely, no doubt there are some Jews who DO see it that way), and more to do with the left-leaning types American and European Jews tend to be.

J'ai un problème de type vomi. 
Je suis jamais vraiment beaucoup sorti, mais avant en soirée, en tant que bon vivant, je mangeais et buvais beaucoup (de choses différentes en principe), puis j'allais pioncer et je me réveillais le matin frais comme un gardon.
Les deux dernières soirées, j'ai à chaque fois fait pareil, sauf que dans la nuit (une fois chez moi aux toilettes et une fois dans la chambre d'un pote), j'ai été malade et j'ai vomi. Et j'ai eu en bonus la gueule de bois sévère, ce qui m'était jamais arrivé avant. Du coup je suis dégoûté de l'alcool, ce qui n'est pas si mal finalement.

Ma question est donc: c'est normal de plus pouvoir boire autant à partir d'un moment? 
Et si oui, vous sauriez pourquoi?

Mene is not gonna play a solo laner hero just because the solo laner hero choice was a ranged hero. BadBenny is not gonna play Kharazim just because he's melee: kharazim is not going to be on the offlane, he'd be on the 4-man

Aconserva3,,,"Specifically Europe, It’s not about job loss, it’s about the sense of entitlement, living off welfare with hardly any getting jobs, crimes amongst migrants at a much much higher rate then locals, and of course every job lost to a migrant is one less European in the work force, every European killed in a terrorist attack is one less European who would otherwise be alive. These random acts of terror on random people does not happen by the locals on nearly the same scale, there’s been hardly any mass shootings, bombings, truck attacks, on random people for political, ideological, or religious aims by the locals. 

The mass migration brings with it terrorism, mass migrant crime, such as the Pakistani rape/grooming gangs in the UK, the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, and leeches off the society expecting us to give them everything. 

Even terrorism, something relatively rare yes, especially in Europe, not so in the Middle East, of the 70,000,000 or so people in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria, around 100,000 (before ISIS died) were members of ISIS, the Taliban, or other radical groups like the Al Nusra Front, around 0.15% of the population. Actively involved in extremist groups. Countless more are exposed to this violence, and millions of innocent people have suffered. 

In many more religious Islamic countries (ie not Kosovo, Albania, Azerbaijan, Malaysia or Turkey. I wonder why crime and terrorism is not such a big problem from these Islamic countries) support for Sharia law is very high, more then 50% of the population, a lot higher on men we can assume, these countries are the same ones we are importing millions of people from. They are bringing the same beliefs, the same culture, the same violence they are fleeing (although most of the migrants are not refugees, not all of them are from the three countries mentioned before) 

Military aged men are the biggest issue, but since no one is willing to just import women and children, it’s in our best interests to stop this “oh look how nice I am” cult of diversity to end. Yes, diversity is good. But just because something is diverse doesn’t immediately make it good. Small, controlled, strict refugee numbers I can get behind, maybe, but even then, what’s the point? Making a few people’s lives better? Oh good. But for every person we bring here, ten more are left behind in the violence, hatred, oppression, and racism that is rampant in these countries. Excuse me for valuing the lives of my countrymen over the economic situations of a couple Algerian military aged men.

8 years later you can become German citizen: http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/for-qualified-professionals/visa/living-permanently-in-germany/naturalisation

More than 1.000 university programmes are taught in English (most of them are Masters): https://www.studying-in-germany.org/international-programmes-germany/

To study at a public university you have to pay an administrative fee of usually 150 to 400 euro per semester, you get a 24/7 public transport ticket in return. Most German states have no further tuition for international students, 1 state wants 1,500 euro per semester.

To get a student visa you need an admission letter from a university and you need to prove that your livelihood is secured, which is the case if you have 8.820 euro for your first year in Germany. You either have the money in a bank account or you have a scholarship or you have parents with a high income who promise to pay for you, etc. During your studies, you can work part-time (120 full days/240 half days per year).

When I go out to clubs or bars [in Germany] with my friends sometimes we get in free just because we look different from everybody else or we're looking good in our chocolate skin. There have been times where guys offered to pay for my meal and everything and I really felt because I was black. From my experience, I feel like being black here you do get treated differently.

For me it's not a problem. It's okay, the people are nice, everyone is nice. Noone has ever shown me anything bad. Actually, I had one experience, but I don't know if the person was in a bad mood or if he actually a racist. We were waiting for the last bus in the bus stop. And this man [the bus driver] looks at us and he just passes, he does not stop. That's the only experience I had, but such things you ignore them, maybe someone was having a bad day. Germans are good. We feel like home living in Germany. We live in a small city, so everybody knows each other. And they are always nice. So for me, living in Germany as Black, we feel like home, we are living with our kids, they're feeling happy. Even where I work, my colleagues, the way they treat us makes us happy.

Rassismus in Germany today - I think it's not a problem within my generation, we are so multicultural. In our generation it's irrelevant what colour your skin has or how you look. But 'problems' can occur with older people, if they are 60 years, 70 years or older: they look twice at me or if I walk by they secure their purse or don't want to sit next to me in the bus even if this is the only empty seat.

MinTamor,,,"&gt; Trade tariffs are especially bad as they are paid by us.

According theory, trade tariffs encourage Brits to buy British products over imported ones. This increases the revenues and profitability of British companies, particularly those outside London, allowing them to pay more in tax to the government, which also pockets the tariff revenues. 

The government can then use those revenues to invest in infrastructure that further enhances the economies of British regions.  We run a massive trade deficit with the EU, which subtracts from our GDP, so curtailing imports would probably make the GDP number go up. 

Edit: Tariffs should also, in theory, encourage foreign investors who wish to sell into the UK market to establish manufacturing sites here, again in regions other than SE England.

jabberwockxeno,Glenn,Metacanadian,"While I agree with your point about religion, I want to point out that the numbers relating to Aztec sacrifice you cite are massively inflated: Researchers have done the math and found it's logistically impossible for as many people as claimed to have been sacrificed in that time span. 

In fact, those numbers are even more inflated then the numbers Cortes gives, which we also know to be false. Part of the problem is that both the Aztecs themselves and the Conquistadors had an impetus to inflate the numbers: For the Aztecs, inflating the numbers of sacrificed made themselves seem more powerful, fearsome, and pious, and for Cortes and the Conquistadors, it served to justify their conquest of the region. Something people forget/don't know is that Cortes was actually disobeyed the spanish crown by conquering the region: There was a warrant for his arrest out by the Governer of Hispaniola and a force was sent out to capture him. It was while he was away from the Aztec captial after holding Montezuma II hostage trying to deal with said force that open hostilities broke out: The person he left in charge massacred a bunch of people at the same pyramid you mention, causing a rebellion. After the Aztecs were toppled, Cortes had to send a series of letters to Charles V jusityfing his actions to avoid execution: The Spanish Crown wasn't actually interested in conquering the native political states at the time. 

Finally, it is also worth noting that the vast majority of Aztec sacrifices were prisoners of war, and were people that would have been killed on the spot in warfare in europe or asia. Not to say that the sacrifice of their own citizens didn't happen, but it was a small minority. The actual rituals are way less sadistic then most people think: It was heavily formal, with a huge focus on specific steps of the ritual, and cleanliness, the remains were treated with respect (it IS a sacrifice to the gods, after all), etc: The popular culture perception that you just had bodies lying all over the place isn't accurate. It was also somewhat voluntary, in that while as a war captive you weren't exactly there by choice, once you were there it was considered a huge honor, garunteed you a high place in the afterlife, and for most ceremonies, meant you got to live as a god for a few weeks before you got your gut torn opne

I also don't mean to say act like the practice is A-okay: Beyond the obvious fact it involved killing people, Insidiously, some Aztec leaders re-wrote the religion to focus more on human sacrifice (since human sacrifice of war captives was a standard part of warefare and religion in tthe region, the aztecs just did more of it, partially due to this incident) and gave it more importance to act as a justification for their own military expansionism (since, remember, most sacrifices were war prisoners: So if you need more sacrifices, then you need more war), and even ""farmed"" enemy states by demanding they have pre-arranged battles with the Aztecs as a form of tribute so the Aztecs could get sacrifices from them, and some accounts indicate that these facts (that it was as much about politicals and warring as it was about the actual religious compenent) were intentionally hid from soldiers so they wouldn't know their lives were essentially being used as poltical tools.

What I *do* mean to say by all of this is just that the popular culture perception of Aztec sacrifice is wildly exaggerated and inaccurate, and it was really just a part of how Mesoamerica handled warfare and geopolitical militarism: It's inhumane and repugnant, but not really moreso then the warring you had in europe or asia, where you has similarly bloodthristy actions happen on the field of battle rather then just capturing your enemies and having it happen later, and similarly having leaders spend their solider's lives over politics there.

UnloadTheBacon,,,"City-residing pro-EU Labour supporter here. My idea of 'utopia' is a world without nations, a socially liberal society where 'live and let live' is the basis of law, and one where the state, with revenue gained through taxation, covers everyone's basic needs.

I'm not naive enough to expect this to ever happen, certainly not in my lifetime, but the EU was a big step toward that kind of society existing in Europe and walking away from it is, to me, a huge step back, especially given our current government's stance on the rights of the individual and the role of the state. The economic costs always seemed blindingly obvious to me, given that the UK hasn't been a superpower on the scale of the EU since the late 1800s.

However, we're leaving the EU now and we must make the best of it.

Kidqward88,,,"I guess for me, there’s the idea of does this thing exist in the fictional world of Star Wars versus the idea of this was a terrible thing that, even though it’s not canon, was most definitely an official Star Wars story/product upon its release. 

Mount Sorrow, the old Marvel Comics and the Holiday Special were way before they idea of a huge, living canon that was thoroughly laid out, I’ll totally give you that.  And at most, stuff like Chewie’s family being reintroduced just acknowledges those characters, without all of that baggage of terrible stories. But! You’re right, they technically were not officially canonized. 

And with the mofference idea, it was in a book that did come out after or around the Zahn trilogy, which most definitely was a canon thing and was sold as such. So if that’s the first major non-movie piece of Star Wars media that was hyped as the continuation of the saga, and the things that followed it also were considered canon (unless otherwise stated, like the dark horse what if book, Star Wars tales I think) then that could be? Unless they went back through everything and deemed this thing canon but not that thing? Which I know they did for a lot of major stuff but I have no idea if every little detail was tracked. So again, let’s say it wasn’t canon, but it was still a hilariously bad idea that was in an official piece of Star Wars media. 

Regarding the eventual complexity and size of the EU towards the end, it might be cohesive like you said, as in yes every piece of this thing fits in chronological order, but you would really say the 300+ novels didn’t have wildly varying tones from author to author? And that a property with over 300 Books isn’t a little messy or hard to get into? Could someone look at that many novels and, with no help, figure out the exact chronology? Could you easily explain to a non-fan what all the original trilogy gang did throughout the timeline? Whether or not the size of it is good or bad is an opinion, you might be ok with that many tie-ins (which I’m not saying is bad ha ha), but for me, it got too dense and derivative. 

I’m not even saying that a continuity that dense is necessarily bad, DC Comics have used their insanely complicated universe to great effect at times, but then they’ve also wiped the slate (nearly) clean like five times because it gets to a point where you really can’t pick up a new comic and fully understand it.  And as a fan growing up with a property like this, it was fun to go deeper and deeper into the world, but by the time I finished high school, I’d given up on most of the novels and comics. I’ll admit however, a lot of my favorite EU stuff worked great as sort of self-contained little series that also felt like they were apart of the wider Star Wars world, like the x-wing Books and the old republic Books.

And yeah, the dark horse stuff, not only with Vader but across the board, when it worked, it worked amazingly. But for me, the prequels and the clone wars humanized anakin and thus Vader,which I liked and had some positives to his character, but I also felt it took away from how terrifying he was, and I guess for me, I really felt that the gillen series, and that rogue one scene, revitalized Vader’s role as a scary, unknowable monster.  The movies are the most effective way to tell a Star Wars story I think, so even though I’d seen classic Vader in various mediums for years, the rogue one scene really worked for me, because the movies are the ‘home’ of Star Wars to me.  And regarding some of the goofier marvel stuff, most of it worked for me ha ha.

Regarding clone wars, i said Lucas oversaw it and had the final say. I didn’t say Lucas wrote for it.  I found an interview with Filoni talking about the role Lucas had: http://www.mtv.com/news/2435334/star-wars-the-clone-wars-supervising-director-dave-filoni-george-lucas-drives-this-whole-thing/

And it could just be him being a sycophant, but the stuff he says conveys that George was involved in the process:

‘George is so involved in the show, I’m not sure a lot of people realize that.’

‘The story ideas, everything we do, it either originates with George or it goes through him for sure.  Nothing gets up on screen that he is not happy with or aware of.’

A lot of it for me is that people will get really mad at some of the decisions that have been made since Disney bought Star Wars, which is totally okay, but it just always seems weird to me when people act like Star Wars was this pure thing, before Disney got it, and that only now stupid stuff is popping up.  When really, since it’s inception, there have been some really stupid things (canon or not) put out with the Star Wars name.

Oh and also, come on, don’t assume that I’m not a ‘good enough’ fan. I’m on a freaking subreddit talking about Mofferences ha ha. I’ve spent way too much time with Star Wars, as I assume you have too.  I’m glad we get to talk about this stuff, and both of us being fans, regardless of our opinions, has been one of the great experiences of my life.

Aconserva3,,,"&gt;man this is dumb:

&gt;wildfires, tsunamis, devastation... mass migration existed.

On the scale of millions? People fleeing thousands of miles from fucking tsunamis? Maybe mass migration from one village to the next, one hundred meters Inland. Get real it didn’t exist, especially thousands of years ago. 

&gt;terrorism? we are fucking the last sapiens, which means we wiped out, aggresively, every other sapien species. Read the book ""Sapiens"". Terrorism was the birth of mankind.... 
You do know what terrorism is right? Politically or ideologically motivated violence? I don see how humans twenty thousand years ago going to war with other humans has anything to with anything. Let’s pretend it was terrorism. So what? Be it happened twenty thousand years ago we should embrace it now? If you’re seriously advocating for terrorism I’m going to have to buy a treadmill as well. “Terrorism was the birth of mankind...” are we not allowed to change? In modern societies, not 20000 BCE, this stuff doesn’t happen. Or at least it didn’t before muh Islam. 

&gt;Welfare? More complex, because many societies super killed anyone slowing them down or making them weaker. But the cultural allegiances towards expressing respect to the elderly at the end of life suggests some level of ""welfare"" was a community oriented and commonplace act.
That’s not welfare. Welfare is “you are poor, here have free shit” Welfare like that didn’t exist. If Abdul wanted to come to the Holy Roman Empire, fine, but we’re not going to give you free stuff, you succeed or fail on your own merits. We also didn’t just kill people that were holding us back, that’s a retarded system. We allowed people we didn’t care about to die yes. The fact remains, welfare didn’t exist then, not as a state sponsored system, and it does now.

&gt;Connected large societes?  WHAT ARE CITY STATES AND EARLY TRADING in Sumerian or Babylonian times?
Those aren’t connected larger societies, those are a few city states trading. Plus I was more referring to prehistoric times, LIKE YOU WERE (SEE I CAN USE CAPS AS WELL) The world was not connected in the sense it is today. If millions are slaughtered in China, me a peasant in Portugal, isn’t going to hear about it, and it will never effect me. 

&gt;How about this? https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/13/ancient-data-modern-math-and-the-hunt-for-11-lost-cities-of-the-bronze-age/
Um... cool? What are you trying to say? If you want random stories, then my cat ate my popcorn before, now she’s on the sofa. 
&gt;Man you comment is just so dumb, it hurts.
Man your comments are just ignorant. Go on, say this to one of the hundreds, thousands, of woman raped by Pakistani or North African immigrants, where the police either ignored it in the case of Britain, or they were barely punished in the case of Germany (four months for child rape, no police investigation of mass sexual assault on NYE in Cologne, six month ban from swimming pool after groping child, etc.) 

Say this to the people who’ve lost people to terrorism, migrant crime, who’s culture, society, and day to day like is being radically changed by these people. 

Say this to the **actual fucking Syrian refugees. These North African, non Syrian middle Eastern, Pakistani, Afghani, North African, and East African scumbags who’ve hijacked the refugee crisis to benefit themselves, taking advantage of Europe, taking advantage of Syria, then coming here and having NO respect for our laws, NO respect for our woman, no gratitude at all.** 

&gt;Large ideologies are literally what built all of modern culture.
Yes they did. I didn’t say they didn’t buddy. 

&gt;Oh man. I wish I could give reverse gold to you, and I mean it.
Oh dear. Do opinIons you disagree with make you upset? Once you’ve stopped walking around the living room, and read this, I just want to end on this. If you’re so upset by a disagreement like this, you are in no way prepared for the fundamental disagreeemnts you will have with Islam. 

These people are coming from very Islamic countries, not 
Albania, Turkey, or Azerbaijan, but violent countries, oppressive countries, racist countries, and countries with strong support of Sharia Law. These single military aged men who cause 99% of the problems are too entitled to stay in their own country, even when that country is relatively fine, like Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, where many of these so called refugees come from.

Where are you from, huh? America? Unless you live in Europe, you really can’t grasp the effect it’s had on the society. People have had enough. The rise of neo nationalism wouldn’t have happened without the migration crisis. 

So there it is. Problems that didn’t exist in the 12th century, do exist now, there is nothing like this back then to even begin to compare, except maybe the Muslim invasions of the Balkans and Iberia. People, who mostly aren’t refugees, come here, no respect, take and take and contribute nothing but dead bodies, rape, assault, and kill. And no, it’s not all of them, or even most of them, but it’s such a number of **military aged men** specifically those not from Syria, who act like this, that the cons out way the pros. Especially considering there are **no pros** 

When you can’t handle diverging thought is when you become a danger, like these people who can’t handle that woman have rights in Europe. 

Edit: and I specifically said 10,000 years ago, so take your Babylonian lost Bronze Age cites and shove them up your ass. That shitdid not exist ten thousand years ago.

[deleted],,,"Hardly anything like American libertarianism existed before the contemporary period. The liberals of the revolutionary period were not shy of implementing tools of the state, which they saw as a way to undermine the economic class divisions which created the feudal system to begin with.

The ""market economies"" that were promoted tried to break up monopolies and oligarchies that were formed by private interests conspiring against the public, as Adam Smith described it. 

The battle between liberals and conservatives therefore were about the purpose of the state in the life, and the very creation of the state as a modern bureaucratic creature complete with rights and responsibility of citizens as opposed to the more personal influence networks and convention based systems of the Monarchies. Not about getting rid of the state altogether in search of some ur-foundation of personal liberty.

Modern libertarians are a complete distinct creature to that, since they've lived their entire lives in a liberal construct of the state, as opposed to the conservatives re-imagening of the monarchies through the autocratic socio-economic systems, and have taken a new position.

[PC EU Social guild]

Who are we?
**We're the Guild of Adventure**, a bunch of adventurers exploring Tamriel in search of adventures, fun, and challenges. We're an active community with representation in ESO, GW2, Overwatch and Destiny 2. Our ESO membership currently stands at 320 active members. Inactives are cleared out from time to time, so the bulk are active. Our focus is to enjoy the game within a community of friends. Our Discord is pretty active (at the time I'm writing this ~60 online).

**What do we do?**
We cover a broad spectrum of activities:
We have guild crafters who will craft anything you require, materials are required.
We have plenty of WW and Vamp bites to go around.
Weekly normal trials ( both cp 160 casual runs and a “training trial” for anyone lvl 50+ *Fridays*
Weekly veteran trials (still casual and fun)
Weekly progression run (Kinda serious AS progression) 
Weekly Imperial Sewer runs, rotating the factions, trying to get that elusive skin and scamp.
Weekly forays into Cyrodil - yeah, we're total noobs at PvP, but it can still be fun! Our home faction for PvP runs is DC.
Figuring out new content - we're planning on making the new trial our progression on Sundays, and will do it every Sunday until we're comfortable with it.
Weekly Craglorn delve and boss events
A weekly Dueling event
Weekly Dungeon roulette - the dice will determine whether it will be first/third person, whether food may be used, whether it is naked, whether pots are to be consumed....
Weekly World Boss hunts
Weekly Guild Raffle
...And plenty more!

**What about vet trials?**
At the moment our vet trials are going well, sadly we need more people interested in running trial content. The guild has done all Craglorn trials on vet, but our signups are not completely guildies which is something we are looking to improve upon! Last Saturday we smashed vAA. While we're crazy enough to have done nSO without a tank, we prefer to be a bit more serious about vTrials, so we don't do the event unless we have a full group signed up. DDs have to post DPS parses, at least 18k. Discord is mandatory for vTrials. That said, we'd rather take an 18k DPS team player, than a 28k DPS who becomes agitated when mechanics are explained. 28k DPS team players are of course also welcome!

**Our conduct**
We're not pros. We have players with heaps of experience, who have every Dungeon or Trial achievement there is, and we have players who bought the game last weekend. We teach and learn from each other, but we don't tolerate verbal abuse of a tank who missed that HA, a DD who died in the red, or a heal whose healing was a bit below par. When we go to Cyro we respect our enemies as they kill us, and when we kill them. When we have a bone to pick with a DD who arrives in a vet dungeon with PvP gear and 4k DPS, we discuss it in a mature and civil way; we don't scream, shout, throw blame or mud.

**Timezones**
Most of our events are at 19h00-21h00 time of the day, GMT. There are exceptions, but that's when most of our members are online.

**How to join?**

Prae_,,,"C'est ni stupide, ni dur à comprendre. Tout est lié à la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique. Tout le programme FI repose sur un préalable : le combat prioritaire, c'est d'éviter la catastrophe climatique.

L'OMC et le FMI vont main dans la main, déjà. Et les deux sont des organisations qui servent activement à ralentir ou supprimer toutes les tentatives de programmes écologiques - ils l'ont déjà fait, le referont, et la conférence de Rio, la base de la base des traités internationaux de lutte contre le réchauffement explicite clairement sa subordination au commerce international.

La relation antithétique entre promotion du commerce international et lutte contre le réchauffement climatique est loin d'être ""bête"", et peut se défendre solidement. Elle s'oppose en général à l'argument que l'innovation va bien réussir à mettre sur le devant de la scène des solutions moins polluantes pour continuer comme on fait actuellement.

Ce qui est pas *impossible*, mais relève pas mal de la profession de foi, je trouve.

L'UE, sur la même logique, pourrait être une belle initiative, pour renforcer un commerce entre peuples voisins (et donc des échanges sur de moins grandes distances). Malheureusement, l'expérience montre que l'UE s'est retrouvé à encourager l'augmentation des distances d'échange (taxes inexistantes et CETA/TAFTA). Là vient un débat entre - en gros - Hamon et Mélenchon : continuer à ""croire en l'Europe"", parce qu'il est vrai que si on arrive par exemple, à instaurer un protectionisme aux frontières de l'UE, ça peut être un gros boost pour l'économie en circuit court.

A la FI, on est d'avis que ça va être dur, et qu'il faut venir aux négociation déterminé : autrement dit, avec un ultimatum. Demander gentillement, Hollande a déjà fait.

Et donc, enfin, l'ALBA qui, dans la même veine, est une action censé renforcer les coopérations locales (et donc promouvoir les circuits courts, en gros).

Je sais pas si c'est *LE* meilleur programme géopolitique du monde, surtout si t'es libéral et pense que le libre-échange, c'est l'avenir et le salut de l'humanité. Moi je pense que libre-échange et lutte contre le réchauffement sont antithétiques et irréconcialiables.

Par contre, il est cohérent et loin d'être le ""festival de la bétise humaine"".

perdyqueue,,,"I realize you didn't say it is, but that's not shot calling, in case anyone's confused. That's conveying basic information to teammates, which is everyone's responsibility, at least in the context of team/pro (read: real) Overwatch. A coordinated team likely has designated viewports for maximum efficiency (e.g. Mercy watching flank routes, Rein watching main choke, Cree watching side doors, Torb guarding point. etc). In fact it's even more useful for ladder play because players so often don't know where they should be looking. Even calling target HP is not necessarily shot calling - it's likewise conveying information that not everyone has access to. On a side note, calling target health on a target either your whole team is looking at or only you can access is a waste of breath and comms clarity..

Shot calling is when you give brief outlines of a plan, or a timing for an engage, which direction the team focuses, who to target first in an engage, etc. It's the macro/strategy (as much as you can come up with in a temporary team of six), while what you're describing is the micro/tactics. Shot calling is understandably rare on the ladder (at least in my experience of EU), I imagine probably because it involves placing trust in a total stranger to know what they're talking about. Personally, I feel it's better to follow every shot caller without exception, just for the security of knowing the whole team is on the same page.

&gt;**Ministro Sérgio Sá Leitão apresenta sete modificações no instrumento de incentivo fiscal, que visam dar mais equilíbrio na distribuição do acesso aos recursos, mais transparência na fiscalização e promover desconcentração regional**  


&gt; “Também não haverá mais o teto por projeto, de R$ 10 milhões - assim, um proponente poderá pedir R$ 60 milhões para apenas um projeto, desde que o orçamento seja comprovadamente compatível.” A Lei Federal de Incentivo à Cultura foi promulgada em dezembro de 1991 e tornou-se conhecida como Lei Rouanet em homenagem a Sérgio Paulo Rouanet, então secretário de Cultura quando a medida foi tomada. Ouvi muitas críticas sobre os processos e as pessoas pediam uma revisão de seu funcionamento”, conta Sá Leitão que, depois de vários encontros com sua equipe, deu o primeiro passo que foi formular uma instrução normativa, que é um ato administrativo pelo qual um ministro dispõe novas normas que serão adotadas no funcionamento de um serviço público reformulado. A instrução normativa publicada na edição desta quinta-feira, 30, no Diário Oficial, busca modificar outra IN, editada em março e que, segundo o ministro da Cultura, Sérgio Sá Leitão, despertava críticas do meio cultural por dificultar o acesso. “A Lei Rouanet apoia-se hoje sobre um tripé: o mecenato, que foi a única coisa que vingou nesses 26 anos; o Fundo Nacional de Cultura, que seria um incentivo direto mas nunca deu muito certo, e os Ficarts (Fundo de Investimento Cultural e Artístico) que, por problema na redação da lei, nunca vingaram”, observa. Um exemplo: o patrocinador de uma peça teatral via lei de incentivo poderá montar um estande de venda de seus produtos na entrada do teatro. “Só terá de usar recursos próprios para custear esse estande”, diz o ministro, confiante de, com isso, aumentar o número de empresários interessados. E, se for um microempreendedor individual (MEI), o proponente também pode ultrapassar o valor máximo de seu projeto, que agora passará a R$ 1,5 milhão.

There is no equivalent for this in the US. So US staff needs to pass all of this as well if they want to work on planes opeating in the EU which I don’t think happens very often.

[deleted],,,"It was a dark night in Istanbul, Turkey. The year was 2005 and the best football team on the planet was preparing to win their next Champions League Trophy. AC Milan boasted the worlds top talents, Kaka, Shevchenko, Crespo, all we’re poised to demolish whatever team dared to come between them and that trophy.

Liverpool FC were the definition of underdogs. Yes they had a history of success but those years had long since passed. Struggling to maintain the pace in the English domestic league, it was only by sheer determination and spirit did they find themselves lining up against the best team of the last five years, Milan.

It was quick, it was hard, it was unsurprising.  Milan raced to a 3-0 lead with apparent ease, slicing open the Liverpool defence without much effort. That was it, game set match. 

The teams walked into the changing rooms at half time, Milan cruising with both hands on the trophy save a finger. Liverpool deflated and out of their depth. 

No one quite knows what was said in the changing room.

The second half was bright, Liverpool seemed determined not to lay over and die. Hello,  Steven Gerrard the Liverpool captain, local hero born and bred on the streets of Liverpool jumped highest and headed the ball into Milan’s net. 

3-1 read the scoreboard as Gerrard raced to the travelling Liverpool fans. His hands waving upwards, his message was clear: don’t give up on us because we won’t give up on you. 

The momentum had changed. Vladimir Smicer if Liverpool collected a nice pass and did what he did best, sliced the ball straight and hard into the bottom of Milan’s net.

Could it be? Could Liverpool write themselves back into Champions League history? Against the giant Milan?

Gerrard raced through the Milan box and was brought down. Penalty. 

The Spanish pass master Xabi Alonso steps up to take the penalty. He couldn’t miss, not our beautiful Spanish conductor. He wouldn’t miss,  not to make to 3-3.

He misses.

In that split moment a thousand hearts break.

And the next moment, Alonso is first to the rebound and he smashes it into the roof of the net.

Delirium.

They’ve done it, against all the odds, they climbed the mountain and pegged back Milan to 3-3.

Penalties would decide it. It was now down to Dudek, the Liverpool keeper.

Liverpool win the Champions League, besting Milan on penalties to become the best European team in 2005.

The fact that it hasn't is not the fault of EU membership.

LightsiderTT,EURO,Europe,"&gt; My point of reference for this topic is the US, and as you well mentioned the system in place there isn't really designed so that getting a post college job as an international student is easy. As a matter of fact its essentially impossible, so I wanted to check if the case was the same or similar in Germany so that I would know to look elsewhere.

I would say that it's nowhere near as difficult as the US, but not as easy as it would be for someone (even a non-EU foreigner) with a degree from a German university. Most of the ease comes from the Blue Card scheme (if you don't fall under the Blue Card rules, it's considerably more difficult) - as, with a Blue Card, the employer (under most circumstances) doesn't have to prove to the immigration authorities that there were *no* comparable German or EU candidates for an open position.

&gt; because I work at a small team I'm getting a lot more of exposure than I would at larger orgs.

It does still happen. I know you want to think only evil american white males could possibly do anything wrong ever in the world but thats just not true, sex slave trade is huge in southeast asia, Child sex slaves, child soldiers in the congo,  Qatar has many indians with no passports, no rights, held against their will and forced to work for their owners. Hey guess what? That's called slavery.


Yeah so actually, the worst example ever of racism against a group of people is very easily the holocaust, which consisted of mostly white europeans. 6 million where killed during that, systematically (i do know how cuckold's love that word, so it was quite fun to throw it in there.)

So the OP didn't quite have the right timeline down, but compared to your argument, he's solid gold.


I know your next argument too, that the holocaust had nothing to do with skin color, That's not racism, racism attacks people based on their RACIAL IDENTITY, which is a LARGER component than just their skin tone. So don't even bother with that flacid ""wouldn't satisfy anyone"" argument.

Something like 10k MS sufferers and many more people of different ailments are criminals when they wouldn't be in if they lived in many US states or European countries. Many people are suffering but don't know of the medical benefits and are too afraid to use it . 

It's barbaric and pure cowardice by the government, medical would likely gain pretty good public support but for whatever pathetic reason they won't. People will suffer needlessly and sick people crimalised .

Also that very ACMD recommends cannabis be a class C, MDMA be a class B and the use of heroin assisted treatment and drug consumption rooms but they ignore all that. Fucking cunts, undermines the entire system with such distain for sensible policies. 

Even more fucked up if you consider those ACMD recommendations are to reduce heroin deaths which is a stated reason by May not to have medical cannabis despite the fact that it's a bullshit argument **and** medical cannabis is starting to show an association with less opiate deaths in America!!

BiftekVisage,,,"Left 3 years ago to move to Asia.

I left primarily because i was (and still am) bored of Sydney (Australia as well, arguably)- I understand this is subjective, but i really have had enough of the place for at least another 5 - 10 years. 

Other factors for the move were - my wife felt exactly the same way, cost of housing in Sydney, extortionate cost of living in Sydney (food, utilities and beer costs are absurd), and just general boredom with life in Australia. Contrary to many people, i wasn't totally dissatisfied with my career however prospects for further growth were becoming limited, and my opportunity to buy a house in a place i actually wanted to live evaporated before my eyes.

Where i live now -  cost of living is lower, people are friendlier (in general, just more civil to each other than in Sydney. Society is much more communal and cooperative, even in the middle of the busiest cities), quality of life is great - all the 'western' trappings are here if you really want them. Food is fantastic. Everyday life is MUCH less regulated. The country itself is so much more interesting and complex than Australia - there are 54 officially recognised ethinc groups here, all with their own languages and customs. Include the informally recognised groups and it's more like 100. The landscapes are more diverse and interesting than Australia - steaming hot palm lined beaches all the way to huge european-esque mountains covered in pine trees and fog + everything in between. Australia for all it's beauty as well, can be monotonous. 
And i'm also just a couple of hours away from new holiday adventures in many other countries too. 

Life is much richer now. I wake up each day feeling excited and optimistic however in my final year in Sydney i was drowning in pessimism and was feeling very uninspired. Plus, most beer here is about $1.25 AUD a glass!

Things I miss the most?

The fight **Heroic vs Natus Vincere** is happening today at 16:00 EET in *DreamHack Open Winter 2017*. Squads will play in Bo1 format. The match will open the group A, which includes: Gambit, Heroic, Natus Vincere and Rise Nation. First match between Gambit and Rise Nation has already passed in favor of the Kazakhstan team. Total prize pool of the championship is $100,000. Eight pro-squads took part in the competition.

Statistics of past meetings of the teams is 6-3 in favor of Heroic. Last time the rivals met on November 10 in *WCA 2017 Europe Main Qualifier tournament* and the victory on Train and Nuke went to [Heroic](https://csgobets.com/team/Heroic). Natus Vincere in previous five matches has three wins and two losses. Heroic beat all five of previous opponents. Despite statistical calculations, bookmakers prefer [Natus Vincere](https://csgobets.com/team/Natus%20Vincere). Betting odds for the game: Natus Vincere 1.65, Heroic 2.07. In my opinion, Natus Vincere today are not in their best form, while Heroic show a very confident dynamics. 

**My prediction** for [this match](https://csgobets.com/match/93228/Heroic-vs-Natus-Vincere-DreamHack-Open-Winter-2017) is **Heroic winners** on Bo1.

myk2801,,,"An interesting question, one that has plagued anthropologists and historians for a long time. One of the conclusions that I've come to explain this apparent simultaneous appearance of agricultural settlements is due to error rates in the radio-carbon dating process. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating). 
Due to inherent errors for this procedure, the differences in age are not a specific number, but rather a range. So imagine a settlement that started agriculture, and the knowledge of this new type of food production took time to spread, but this time period would be shorter than a 100 years (which is one of the examples given in the wiki article about the range of detection). Additionally, early settlements were nomadic, and usually shifted after a year or two to a new site. Enough time and spread within a 100 years to make it seem like they appeared simultaneously throughout the planet. Considering that Asia, Europe and northern Africa have displayed the oldest agricultural cities, over which land based migration of knowledge would be possible, the problem of navigating the seas and oceans can be explained. Plus, evidence of early settlements is scanty and hard to come by due some of the sites not been excavated or found.

&gt;**Maioria das siglas governistas vê um cenário ainda incerto e evita se comprometer com nomes colocados como possíveis candidatos em 2018**  


&gt; BRASÍLIA - Embora o Planalto defenda uma candidatura única à Presidência em 2018, a maioria das siglas da base aliada vê um cenário ainda incerto e evita se comprometer com nomes colocados como possíveis candidatos. Em entrevista nesta quarta-feira, 29, o ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, afirmou que a ideia é construir uma candidatura única entre os partidos da atual base de sustentação do governo Temer para “representar esse legado”. Como mostrou o Estado no sábado, 25, o presidente Michel Temer articula a construção de uma ampla frente de centro-direita para ajudar na aprovação de pautas econômicas, principalmente da reforma da Previdência, e mantê-la unida até a disputa eleitoral de 2018. “Tudo vai depender de como a economia estará, como o ‘Fora, Temer’ ficará no próximo ano”, disse o presidente nacional do DEM, senador Agripino Maia (RN). Ele diz que, atualmente, a sigla tem “pouca chance” de apoiar Lula, embora o presidente da legenda, senador Ciro Nogueira (PI), tenha declarado voto no ex-presidente. A prioridade do presidente licenciado da legenda, o ministro Gilberto Kassab (Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações), é se eleger em uma chapa majoritária em São Paulo ao lado do senador José Serra (PSDB). O presidente nacional do PMDB, senador Romero Jucá (RR), avalia que Alckmin e Meirelles são dois nomes viáveis para serem o candidato do centro.

Even if we dropped to an immigration rate of zero (which would be ill-advised given our population growth) and disallowed all foreign workers, we still wouldn't have proper full-time jobs with benefits for Canadians.

If you actually care about Canadians having good jobs, then what you need to ask for, nay, demand from our government is improvement in our labour standards (and equal application of such standards to everyone - all jobs, all workers - foreign, domestic).  Companies are able to save a significant amount of money by hiring a bunch of part-time or temp workers (or, yes, temporary foreign workers), having them perform the same work that full-time workers would do, but treating them like garbage and paying them little.  This should not be allowed.  Period.

And we may well need to adopt some new ideas.  For example, benefits like vacation time or pensions could be attached to the employee, not the employer, and could follow them from job to job, to reflect the fact that life time employment with a single employer is no longer the norm.  I believe this is how it is done in some European countries.  

A guaranteed minimum income may be required to address increasing automation and the fact that there may come a point where it is impossible to provide enough work for everyone - it has been proposed by some that the government could tax the means of production, that is, robots, in order to pay for this.  The alternative would be a tiny elite that owns the robots and all the wealth, perhaps a small working class if some jobs cannot be automated or the wealthy like human servants, and a massive underclass that owns nothing...quite a dystopia.

r_golan_trevize,,'96 Mustang GT/IRS,"Europe and the US were two completely different environments in which cars and driving habits and preferences evolved. The biggest difference to me is the high penalties on large engines Europeans, either through taxes on displacement or through much higher fuel prices, have had from pretty much the beginning. This incentivized small engines that worked much better with a manual transmission until very recently. Torque converter automatics from their inception up to not too long ago, soaked up a lot of power and were very inefficient compared to a manual gearbox and just weren't a practical alternative where power and efficiency were are at such a premium.

Over here, even when our gas prices get high, they're still much, much less than in Europe and most of the time they're low enough to not worry too much about and we've never discouraged large engines. Our big V8s had plenty of torque to spare for those inefficient automatics and we didn't care about the MPGs because gas was so cheap and, lets face it, humans are lazy by nature and will automate anything they can. 

The last holdouts here for manuals were zero option stripped out cars for cheapskates which were the first to go as economies of scale and the cost of certifying multiple drivetrains drove out the manuals with their low take rates, then economy cars which could still eke out better MPGs for a while but the autos eventually caught up and they will eventually succumb to the same pressures as the strippers before them, and finally sporting cars which are already seeing manuals die at the very top end in exotic sports cars but these will probably be the last holdouts for the manual where the romanticized driving experience still counts for something.

Now that automatics, whether they be fancy dual clutch autos or highly refined multigear, lock up torque converter autos, are as or more efficient than a traditional manual, you're starting to see them become more popular in places where they used to be shunned.

Trying one bra in a range of sizes is usually the best way to nail down the cup volume you need, and can offer extra insight into your shape, especially when there's a wider range of cup sizes suggested by your measurements.

Why did they know english? Well, traders had been slaving, raiding, and arming the local populations for years. Remember Squanto? Yeah, the only reason he knew the things he did was because he was kidnapped, slaved, and then rescued by spanish monks who taught him english. Oh, the reason the conquest didnt happen the reverse way was because natives lacked the ability to do so.

""On top of that they've found plenty of European settlements in Newfoundland where no Columbian slavery happened at all.""

Yes. So what?

""Morever, we don't see this ''human nature'' when the Norse discovered the Moors and the Arabs. No, then they traded, worked together, exchanged culture, and some vikings even became Muslims. There was no war or slavery.""

So a trading and seafaring people travel extremely far, meet new peoples with new stuff, then trade for it. Surprise? The reason you dont see much viking-muslim conflict is because they didnt live next to each other. muslims and more southern europeans fought all the time. (How are you this dense?) this is exactly my point. I was to seperate the different groups so we can live as the muslims and vikings did. 

""And then there's the some 4000 years of stone/bronze age autonomy where we didn't have kings, or wars, or slavery or any of that shit. Something most Nazis conveniently omit.""

Who the fuck are you talking about? the amerindians? you do realize they had tribal cheifs, regular wars, and slavery, right? Not uniformly, but at least one of those was in place with all native tribes. 

""But to be fair you shit for brains can't even remember what happened in the 1940's so I'm not surprised.""

Drzhivago138,,2002 Mazda Tribute ES V6,"Lemme try this again without blacklisted links:

A sedan can have either four doors or two doors, but has the same roofline either way. Historically, the 2-door sedan was often reserved for the most basic model of car: Here's a ['67 Fairlane 2-door sedan](https://hobbydb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/processed_uploads/catalog_item_photo/catalog_item_photo/image/276817/1967_FORD_Fairlane_2_Door_Cars_273e9c7a-cbaa-400d-aa76-0c2e61d08eb2.jpg) vs. the ['67 4-door sedan](http://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/198435/198435_Side_Profile_Web.jpg). Just as 4-door sedans shared many parts with 4-door wagons, so too were 2-door sedans used as the basis for 2-door wagons: [Falcon 2-door sedan](https://d3dxp4akn1otfb.cloudfront.net/1964-Ford-Falcon-american-classics--Car-100878165-b7de692219f04465275db7211558df31.jpg?r=fit&amp;w=430&amp;s=1) vs. [Falcon 2-door wagon](http://car-from-uk.com/ebay/carphotos/full/ebay708006.jpg).

In the years before seatbelts and child locks, 2-door sedans and wagons were often considered suitable family cars, as they had the same interior room as 4-doors, but allowed the parents to ""lock"" their brood in the rear seat without worrying about them inadvertently opening the doors and tumbling out onto the turnpike.

A coupe is different from a 2-door sedan in that it has something cut down: the word ""coupe"" comes from the French *couper,* meaning ""to cut."" This can either refer to the roofline being cut down, the wheelbase being shortened, or both. This ['67 Fairlane](https://cdn2.mecum.com/auctions/fl0115/fl0115-204277/images/fl0115-204277_2.jpg?1422115263000) has the same 116"" WB as the 2- or 4-door sedan, but its hardtop roofline is sloped more in the back. The 1968-77 GM A-bodies used a 112"" WB for coupes and a 116"" WB for sedans.

Coupes can have a B-pillar or not (pillarless hardtop), though this sometimes affects their desirability. In the late '60s/early '70s, GM referred to their lowest-priced 2-door A-body models as [""2-door sedans,""](http://lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/70buick/bilder/26.jpg) but since they rode on a 112"" WB vs. the sedan's 116"", they are technically just coupes with a B-pillar.

2-door sedans *always* have a B-pillar, so they are sometimes referred to as ""2-door posts"" to differentiate from the pillarless hardtop style also popular in the late '60s. Even though flashy hardtops were heavily promoted during the muscle car era, ""2-door posts"" were often more desirable than pillarless hardtops to street racers, for two reasons: one, they were usually base model cars, so they were cheaper; and two, the B-pillar gave better structural rigidity to the body. In the years since, pillarless hardtops got more popular due to their image, while 2-door posts were unceremoniously junked on the enduro circuit. Now, we're seeing something of a turnaround, as 2-door sedans are once again desirable due to their rarity.

2-door sedans largely died out in the early '70s among American cars, but they continued on smaller Japanese and European models well into the early '80s ([like this '81 Corolla 2-door sedan](http://topclassiccarsforsale.com/uploads/photoalbum/1981-toyota-corolla-sedan-2-door-coupe-3.jpg)), before also fizzling out in those models as well as they moved further upmarket.

Read up on the **Kalergi Plan** (which refers to the agenda of destroying European nations by eliminating borders and intermixing other populations), then the pieces start to fall into place.  
Also make sure to watch [**Europe - The Last Battle**](https://youtu.be/pJ0soqQPl5A), (highly concentrated red pill 10-part documentary)

-----

The agenda has been planned out since the 1920s, when the forerunner to the EU (Pan-Europe) was being planned out and promoted by [Count Coudenhove-Kalergi](http://archive.is/C233e#selection-8043.80-8121.62) and [Bronislaw Huberman](http://archive.is/wfaMy) and others.

&gt;One of the most distinctive voices was the Habsburg count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi. According to theorists of revolution, people like him should have been relegated to the dustbin of history, like the empire he had come from. Yet instead, Coudenhove became something of an international celebrity in mid-twentieth-century Europe. In 1923, he popularized the idea of a Pan-European Union, which became widely associated with him in subsequent years, not just in German-speaking communities but also in international circles. Coudenhove argued that the world had to cease thinking in nations and to begin thinking in continents before a world federation of states would eventually be possible in the utopian future. In doing so, Pan-Europe would have to struggle side by side with the Soviet Empire, the British Commonwealth, and with Pan-America. He imagined that Pan-Europe would include the French and formerly German colonies of Africa and Asia, along with French Guyane, as territories to be held in common by the European nations.

Just look at [their plan for the borders of Pan-Europa on this map](http://i.imgur.com/yeHtaBL.jpg), it includes most of Africa, and Syria too.

They wanted to erase borders and nations and create a servile mixed race worker caste of African-Eurasians, to be ruled over by an aristocracy of Chosen elites.

&gt;[The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi#Views_on_race_and_religion)

...

&gt;[Instead of destroying European Jewry, Europe, against its own will, refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process. No wonder that this people, that escaped Ghetto-Prison, developed into a spiritual nobility of Europe. Therefore a gracious Providence provided Europe with a new race of nobility by the Grace of Spirit. This happened at the moment when Europe's feudal aristocracy became dilapidated, and thanks to Jewish emancipation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Coudenhove-Kalergi#Views_on_race_and_religion)

The first paragraph is a translation of the [second paragraph on page 17 of Kalergi's book *Adel* published in 1922 in the German language](https://archive.org/stream/Coudenhove-Kalergi-Adel/Coudenhove-kalergiRichard-Adel192256S.Scan-text#page/n19/mode/2up).

The second paragraph is a translation of the text that begins in the middle of the [fourth paragraph on page 39](https://archive.org/stream/Coudenhove-Kalergi-Adel/Coudenhove-kalergiRichard-Adel192256S.Scan-text#page/n41/mode/2up) of the same book.

Kalergi is widely understood to be the ideological founder of the EU, and a [prize is given in his name every year](http://www.coudenhove-kalergi-society.eu/Europapreistraeger). [Merkel won it in 2010](http://archive.is/scnqO).

Kalergi even helped choose Ode to Joy as the EU anthem. See this [source](http://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/exchange_of_letters_between_richard_coudenhove_kalergi_and_paul_m_g_levy_3_august_1955_to_5_september_1955-en-34a3b196-9a23-4e9e-a977-94e31495b169.html): ""J'aimerais bien proposer la hymne de la 9ème symphonie comme hymne européenne"". This was in a letter to [Paul Lévy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_M._G._L%C3%A9vy) (i.e. the guy who designed the EU flag, the symbology of which is not well explained).


Here is [Kalergi's biography](http://www.karlspreis.de/en/laureates/richard-nikolaus-graf-coudenhove-kalergi-1950/biography) from receiving the first ever 1950 Charlemagne Prize:

&gt;Born on 16th November 1894 in Tokyo.

&gt;Studied history and philosophy at the University of Vienna, 1916 Promotion to Dr. Phil. Active as independent writer.

&gt;**Published the political text ‘Paneuropa’ in 1923; he founded the Paneuropean Movement in the same year. Between the years 1924 and 1938 he published the journal ‘Paneuropa’, in which he did all he could to form a European confederation.**

&gt;During the war he stayed in Pressburg, Bern and, from 1940, in New York, where he taught as professor of history and set up a research department for a European post-war federation. He relocated to Switzerland in 1946.

&gt;**In 1947 he became General Secretary of the European Parliamentary Union, which he had founded himself.**

&gt;Died on 27th July 1972.

So, just a year after writing *Adel* (1922) [Adel is the German word for nobility/aristocracy], in which he advocated mixing European, Asian, and African races together and giving them over to the ""spiritual nobility of Europe"" he so admired, he wrote the book Paneuropa about creating a federalized Europe. He remained active in this cause.

In his 1950 [acceptance speech](http://www.karlspreis.de/en/laureates/richard-nikolaus-graf-coudenhove-kalergi-1950/speech-extract-by-richard-nikolaus-count-of-coudenhove-kalergi) for the Charlemagne prize, Kalergi said:

&gt;‘The “Union Charlemagne” should […] be established not as an economical union but as a six-state confederacy: Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg. We are dealing with no less than the renewal of the Karolinger Empire on a democratic, federal and social basis. […] Therefore I appeal to all those of good will to bring a movement to life for the total reconciliation between the Germans and the French through the renewal of the Empire of Charlemagne as a confederacy of free nations. Today this Charlemagne movement should stem from Aachen in the memory of that German–French emperor, to transform Europe from a battlefield of recurring world wars to a peaceful and blooming worldly empire of free people!’

In 1957, the forerunner to the [EU began with the same six founding members](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/from-6-to-28-members_en) that Kalergi had envisioned in his 1950 speech.

&gt;The organisation founded in 1957 which is now known as the European Union, originally had six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

Kalergi's utopian vision was to ""unite"" Europe by erasing its borders and its constituent peoples, and putting Jews in charge. His vision became the European Union.

Phtpnk,,,"Nikolai Ceausesceu.

He was the General Secretary/President of Communist Romania from 1965 to 1989.

He was *insane. Legit insane.*While he was popular in the late 60s due to him having an open policy independent from the USSR (which many approved), he had different motives.

He was *obsessed* with Romanian demographics and wanted to significantly increase the population. Problem is, he did this by following Nazi’s *Kinder, Kirche, Küche* policy - He banned all forms of abortion, instituted a policy of special aid to mothers of three or more and a title of heroine mothers to women who bore 10 children of more. It backfired on him by form of massive ghettos in Bucharest.

However, his real amounts of stupidity come here:

• **Securitate** - His own version of the Stasi and KGB, which aimed on spying on major world leaders, despite the fact that he did his best to maintain his status in the eyes of the U.S and the West. While it existed since the late 40s during the reign of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, he significantly increased the power of the organization. 

The agency’s intelligence network was destroyed when a 3-star general and a high ranking commander in Securitate, Ion Mikhail Pacepa, defected to the U.S in 1978. To this day, he is the *highest ranking Eastern Bloc official to defect*. He lost his influence and organised 17 death squads and dispatched them to the U.S to find him, and even hired Carlos The Jackal (yes, *that one*) to kill him, but unsuccessfully. Pacepa is still alive and in hiding as of this day (Romania still has a death sentence issued on his name).

• **Oil** - He was also obssesed with turning Romania into a world power. To achieve this, he loaned *billions of dollars* from foreign countries in order to purchase a large quantity of Iranian oil fields from the Shah in order to build a large pipeline through Romania, hoping to turn it into a main oil supplier for Eastern Europe. However, this happened in 1979...year of the Iranian revolution. As you can guess, the new leaders decided the deal was void but kept the money. This nearly created a *national bankrupcy*. 

Unwilling to turn to the Soviet Union for help, he created new laws on taxes. He basically created third world living conditions in Romania to save money. He restricted importing, limited electricity and news broadcast to a few hours a day, and created a massive shortage of supplies in stores., creating large rations through an austerity program.  This lasted for *10 years*, and even after he finally paid off the debt in November 1989, he never did ease those restrictions.

To make matters worse, he himself was unwilling to adapt to this and maintained a lavish lifestyle for himself, and also used what little money is left to build a new parliament building, the Palace of the Parliament. To this day, this is the *largest, most expensive admistrative building, and also the heaviest building in the world, it’s size stretching over 365.000 square meters*. It took 13 years to complete the building (1984 - 1997, well after his reign), and the cost was around 4 *billion* dollars. To this day, Romanian parliament only uses 30% of the building.

• **Timisoara** - Romanian Revolution, while massive and was as newsworthy as Fall of the Wall, started off with a really small, insignificant event. In Timisoara, a large Romanian city, officials tried to evict a Hungarian pastor and member of the Hungarian Church, László Tökeś, who was critical of the government. Hungarian minority staged public protests across the city in support of him, protesting against the government. Within days, the *entire Romania rebelled and protested*, to the point that many even forgot what started it.

It culiminated quickly, and Ceausesceu actually left the country and left his wife and subordinates to deal with the rebellion while he was visiting Iran on a state visit. When he returned, he held a final speech on 21st December, 1989, hoping to gain support by addressing the issue. However, a poor error in judgement (blaming Timisoara on fascists and announcing the increase of the lowest salaries by 200 lei, or, back then, $9 U.S) caused a huge, full blown uprising.

He fled to his palace and hid there for a few days,  turning bad into worse by ordering the army to shoot protestors. It turned into a massive shitshow, and eventually the army switched sides and stormed the parliament a few days later. He fled with his wife via helicopter, but he was captured by the army and sentenced to death in a sham trial. He was executed a few days later.


On a grand scale, he wasn’t worse than Hitler, but his series of errors in judgement, his poor handling of the country and dozens of poorly handled decisions made him a clown. He was also a big supporter of the Kim family’s rule over North Korea and a fan of the *Juche* philosophy, and sought to emulate the cult of personality of Josip Broz Tito (former Yugoslavian leader) and the Kim family, but failed spectacularly.

I have not read a single positive article in Turkey in a long time. I don't see the western media talk how Turkey's been growing faster than any other European country. I don't see anything about that. Turkey's operation in Syria killed more than 1500+ ISIS fighters. Turkey never got the credit it deserved. United States kept arming YPG/PYD and Turkey sent many proofs that the guns sent to them was being used against Turkey and killed turkish soldiers. The US still arms terrorist organizations in the area rather than supporting its NATO ally. Turkey hosts more than 3 million refugees but you don't read about that. People earn more, the minimum wage has gone up more than 10%. Don't read about that. AKP has built infrastructure more than any other government combined. Don't read about that. 

   One of the and I think the main reason why there is a huge propaganda against Erdogan is because Turkey's defense system. Erdogan has refused to buy defense equipment from other countries way long ago and invested so much money on Turkish made defense equipment. He also doesn't get lectured by the US or the Europe and does what he believes is the best for the country. And this is why he keeps being elected.

   I can list many more reasons why you guys keep getting Turkey wrong. And you will, again, get it wrong in  2019 elections. I see many people saying that how you guys feel bad for turkish people because they don't get to read and know the truth. Yeah they do. And believe me they feel bad for you guys and how the west has been brainwashed by the media that's controlled by people who don't want to see fully independent, powerful Turkey in the most complicated region of the world.

The planned visit had been hailed by media as an unexpected rapprochement between the two foes, and by Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry — as ""historic"".[29][30][8] The sheer fact of the King′s visit was interpreted by American media as suggesting that the Saudi government, a close ally of the United States for more than 70 years, was pursuing a more independent role in the U.S.-Russian geopolitical rivalry.[31][32][33]

On the first day of negotiations, a package of bilateral documents was signed[34] that ranged from oil, military and space exploration.[35][36] The weapons deals worth three billion dollars to be finalised at the end of October 2017, in line with Saudi Arabia’s bid to localise arms manufacturing, envisaged the possibility of transfer of technology for the local production of Russian Kornet-EM anti-tank missiles, TOS-1A rocket launchers and AGS-30 automatic grenade launchers, the latest version of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, and long-range S-400 missile system.[37][38][39][40] ",True,0,1512143312,,False,0,dqm1tlc,False,t3_7gufpl,t1_dqm0bnt,/r/worldnews/comments/7gufpl/european_parliament_passes_a_motion_to_impose/dqm1tlc/,1514233371,2,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,public,

I really think these small types of communities are the future of neighborhood design - small, self-sufficient communities of 100 to 150 people, where resources such as energy, water, and heat are centralized and shared. Where people's dwellings are designed around a central community center, with things like laundry facilities, a large kitchen, food storage area, project area, a garden, and maybe even resources like a small general store, bakery, and a butcher.

A lot of villages around the world were designed in such a way, and even in Europe now, a lot of small towns are centered around a church/Community center, a local baker, a butcher, and yes, even candlestick maker's.  I've actually lived in a few of these type of places in Germany, and loved them.  Unfortunately, much of the new construction I've seen while traveling around Europe has been modeled after American neighborhoods, and it's a real shame.

I think we quit arming them...

&gt;I voted Obama

Ah, so you made the same mistake before? :)

&gt;The neo-con/neo-libs want these wars to never end, i think that's apparent. Why exactly?

It's about control.

First of all, the reason we invaded Iraq in 2001: Saddam Hussein was trying to set up an oil market trading in Euros instead of dollars, and I would speculate that our action against Libya (which actually hurt Italy more than anyone else) was indirect retaliation. Oil being traded in dollars means that we can manipulate the market at will just by manipulating our currency, potentially wrecking other countries' economies.

Second of all, Iran and Russia are trying to get oil and gas into Europe, and we are trying to stop them. Again, control; we are already worried because of Germany's dependence on Russian gas, and their attempts to avoid it have driven their energy prices up (all that solar) as well as increased their emissions (from burning the lignite coal they have), which is why we are trying to ship natural gas (!).

&gt;Like look at crazy fat boy rocket man in NK atm

Which is ironic, because if you take away the propaganda, he, and his predecessors, have behaved perfectly logically every step of the way.

We are the ones still trying to win the Korean War, for ""democracy"" (when we were worried that the election wouldn't go our way!).

&gt;he has Russia and China on board now with the sanctions

It won't last; not a chance. China is not going to simply cede the Korean Peninsula to us, not without a trade... how do you feel about Taiwan?

&gt;so far so good if you ask me?

OK, even granting all of that, let's look at the negatives:

Neil Gorsuch is the most ideologically radical member of the Supreme Court in living memory. Jeff Sessions has geared the DOJ up to crank the War on Drugs back up. Congress is about to cut taxes on the rich and corporations, again, which every economist and historian is saying will lead to mandatory budget cuts and massive deficits.

I actually think this article does a pretty good job of explaining why it's a big deal and why frankly it deserves a bit of fanfare

[A Mixed-Race Royal Couple? It Wouldn’t Be the First](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/black-princess-meghan-markle.html)

I can't find anyone talking about a black royal beyond Queen Charlotte (after whom Charlottesville was named if i recall correctly). And there's still debate about whether she was even black enough to shock her husband on their wedding day or if it was just a great-great-great-great-grandfather (I've heard it both ways). There are other black royals in other European families but in England it's pretty ""new"". 

Women love weddings. They're programmed socially to do so. Royal weddings are like super weddings. We could make the same argument about the Superbowl and that happens literally every year.

&gt;On the other hand, just last month there was news about an American woman marrying an Ethiopian prince (technically a pretender to the throne, but still), and no one talks about that.

I won't pretend to be fully versed on the grandsons and great grandsons of Haile Selassie so I can't tell exactly which part you are criticizing (parentage, royalty). My sister is MUCH more versed on the history than I am. But I will acknowledge that the story didn't get nearly as much traction as Markle's story. To an extent that was ALWAYS going to be the case. We're talking English royalty. One of the most famous and prominent lines of this contemporary era. Every English wedding is a big deal like this. I actually think that so far this hasn't actually gotten bigger than the other English weddings I know of. People TALK as if it's a bigger deal and it probably IS a bigger deal because of Markle but I don't really think they're more obsessed or fangirling about it than normal.

&amp;nbsp;

As a member of the 29th Infantry Division, I would like to invite you to consider our Charlie Company.

&amp;nbsp;
     
The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

&gt;**De forma reservada, parlamentares que representam setor do agronegócio que participaram de almoço com o pré-candidato à Presidência dizem que deputado foi 'genérico' e 'inconsistente'**  


&gt; BRASÍLIA - Um almoço fechado do deputado Jair Bolsonaro (PSC-RJ) com parlamentares ruralistas expôs nesta terça-feira, 28, divergências entre o pré-candidato ao Palácio do Planalto e o setor do agronegócio. A gente não quer uma pessoa que traga mais insegurança”, afirmou o deputado Domingos Sávio (PSDB-MG), que foi um dos poucos parlamentares a usar o púlpito montado na sede da FPA para falar. Estão mais preocupados em dar declarações que comovam a opinião pública do que fazer análises profundas”, disse Sávio. Bolsonaro disse que, caso seja eleito, entregará o Ministério da Agricultura de “porteira fechada” para o setor indicar técnicos, do ministro aos assessores. O deputado Luiz Nishimori (PR-PR) afirmou ter gostado do discurso de Bolsonaro, mas reconheceu que não é novidade ministro da Agricultura ser escolhido pelo setor. +++Marina diz que vai decidir se disputa a eleição até o carnaval O deputado Nilson Leitão (PSDB-MT), líder da FPA, foi questionado sobre as críticas reservadas de parlamentares a Bolsonaro. Leitão ressaltou que o grupo já recebeu o governador Geraldo Alckmin e o prefeito João Doria, ambos dos PSDB.

What (if any) opinions do you have on the [changing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names#English-speaking_world) of names upon marriage?  
\- Neither spouse changes his last name  
\- One spouse assumes the other's last name&amp;hellip;  
\- \- &amp;hellip;and abandons his original last name  
\- \- &amp;hellip;and replaces his original middle name with his original last name  
\- Hyphenation:  
\- \- One spouse's name goes first for both participants  
\- \- Each spouse puts his name first and the other's name second  
\- \- Each spouse puts his name second and the other's name first  
\- \- What about the next generation?  
\- Both spouses amalgamate their last names

I'm inclined to think that the simplest option is the best option, since changing one's name incurs a risk of mistakes (e.&amp;nbsp;g., on credit reports) and makes filling out forms a hassle (""Have you ever worked under a name different from your current name? If so, list all other names.""). I was quite surprised when, some months ago, I [saw](https://i.imgur.com/4tBgZk8.png) that the wife of Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) had assumed his last name.

Having gotten halfway through of *[A Game of Thrones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496)* (without having seen any of the television series), I have to say that, so far, it's seeming to be just another piece of [generic medieval fantasy](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Medieval_European_Fantasy) rather than something particularly impressive. I definitely prefer *[The Runelords](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144127)* (discussed [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ket47) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3t143r)).

(I really should get around to reading the first four books of [the *Runelords* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322) for a second time, and maybe even finally reading the second four books for the first time. On the other hand, I *still* haven't bothered to finish cleaning up the hideous formatting of my [DRM-free](http://www.baen.com/baenebooks) copies of the last three books of [the *Belisarius* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40821), which have been sitting on my hard drive for *literally* a year! And I haven't re-read *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* in something like a year, either, so I probably should either get started on a seventh reading or finally complete the thorough editing job that I've been too lazy to do for *several* years. *So* many choices&amp;hellip;)

How many places where there is pro/rel have more than one viable soccer club in the city? How are we going to handle stadia for every podunk club that stands up and every pro-team that has a couple bad years?

We already have owners chasing *new stadiums* by threatening to move their teams.

I just don't see it being a sustainable structure in the US, at least in its pure form. Perhaps having a modified pro/rel system, where teams are either in D1 or D2, D3 or D4, and pretty much between seasons bounce between those two, and every X years have a show down between the teams with the worst records in D2 and the top teams in D3 for a shot at moving between the division groupings. Say 4 years.

I'm not *completely* against pro/rel, but there are a lot of logistics, economics, and other considerations to work out and truth be told, it won't be identical to Europe to begin with, if ever.

UKIP only did well during EU elections is because so few voted in them and this is a problem across the EU so is no by limited to the UK. UKIP also rised fairly recently, with still being in single digits in 2012 and I would argue that the reasons why people voted for UKIP was general disillusionment and the EU provided a convenient channel. 

As for the idea that resentment would grew and grew without one I don’t think so. Just like in France where there was fears of the front national gaining ground but we ended up with the unashamedly pro-EU candidate as president and the Front National being in crises, feeling pressure to tone down their message.

All the trade and debt or whatever is irrelevant when it comes to having a war with China. You think there's never been a war  between trading partners before? You really think that China is ""reformed"" or some shit?

Let me give you a history lesson. When Marxism spread to Asia, the Asian intellectuals thought they could skip capitalism, that only Europeans needed to pass through Capitalism on the way to Communism. So the Asian Marxist nations tried to skip from agrarian societies directly to socialism while industrializing. This didn't go so well. Millions died/were killed and the West far outpaced Asia in production and development, and other  non-European nations that embraced  Capitalism also developed faster than Asian Marxist countries. 

So the Communist party of China said, ""Hey, we need to go through a period of capitalism after all."" So the Communist party of China literally created its own class of capitalists to help speed up development. They are not fucking reformed. They are not a magical liberal democracy. Capitalism was intended to be a temporary phenomenon, and when the Communist party decides they've grown enough they'll go right back to full socialism and nationalize everything and confiscate the wealth of all the capitalists. Wealthy Chinese who know what the fuck is going on will do pretty much anything to get their wealth out of the country, if you hadn't noticed.

Some of the praise has to go to Emperor Hirohito. The government of Japan initially rejected the US' proposals. Hirohito convinced them to accept certain articles.


&gt; ""At his first meeting with MacArthur, Hirohito assumed full responsibility for the wartime actions of Japan knowing that this admission could mean his execution. Eventually the U.S. and other Allied powers agreed with MacArthur not to treat Hirohito as a war criminal, but one condition was mandated. On New Year's Day 1946, four months after the occupation had begun, Emperor Hirohito renounced the belief that he was a divine or godlike being: "" The ties between us and our people have always stood upon mutual trust and affection. They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine and that the Japanese people are superior to other races and fated to rule the world. "" These words, while shocking to most Japanese, smoothed the way for the more than six years of occupation that were to come. Certain aspects of the U.S. occupation policy carried out by MacArthur were very harsh. Wartime Prime Minister Tojo and six other leaders were tried and hanged for war crimes. The policies dismantled and abolished the Japanese military establishment and banned 200,000 military and civilian leaders from holding any public office, including the majority of existing Diet members. The large industrial monopolies that had fueled the war effort were broken up. Even government support for the official Japanese religion, Shinto, was eliminated. At the same time, MacArthur promoted the development of democracy in Japan. He suspended Japanese laws restricting political, civil and religious liberties. He ordered the release' of political prisoners and abolished the secret police. He announced a general election to be held in April 1946, only seven months following the surrender. He also called for the Japanese Diet to pass a new election law to provide for free democratic elections, including, for the first time in the history of Japan, the right of women to vote. In addition, under MacArthur's direction, the growth of labor unions was encouraged, large landholdings were broken up and the education system was reformed. Surprisingly, all of these developments were accepted and in some cases even welcomed by the Japanese. Of course, Japan was under the control of armed U.S. troops. Still, the ordinary Japanese, seeing death and destruction all around, seemed to conclude that the old way of doing things had failed. War and a humiliating defeat had made Japan ripe for revolutionary change. ""


&gt; The US helped rebuild Europe though massive financial assistance in the form of the Marshall Plan

The Marshall plan laid the foundations for transnational corporations, of whom much criticism can be made.

The Marshall plan, henceforth TMP, did not aid many countries, and only gave what can be considered a boost, something that would have happened anyway.

TMP was another form of American imperialism, in it's fight against leftist ideology.

Europe was well on it's way to recovery before TMP was put in place. It was just another way to in-debt the countries to the US.

I don't see it as a bad thing, in fact I appreciate it, but acting like it was a loss free completely good thing is wrong.

&gt; America prevented the entire Korean peninsula from being like North Korea thus facilitating the rise of South Korea which is an advanced nation. I am aware that they were under a dictatorship until the 80's but they are still better off than the North by a significant degree

Two parts to this.

America destroyed North Korea. Killed about 20% of it's population. It excused and allowed massacres be perpetrated by the south with no repercussions, such as the vast rapes of North Korean women.


U.S. Air Force bombed and napalmed cities, towns and villages across the North. It was mostly easy pickings for the Air Force, whose B-29s faced little or no opposition on many missions.

The bombing was long, leisurely and merciless, even by the assessment of America’s own leaders. “Over a period of three years or so, we killed off — what — 20 percent of the population,” Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air Command during the Korean War, told the Office of Air Force History in 1984. Dean Rusk, a supporter of the war and later secretary of state, said the United States bombed “everything that moved in North Korea, every brick standing on top of another.” After running low on urban targets, U.S. bombers destroyed hydroelectric and irrigation dams in the later stages of the war, flooding farmland and destroying crops.

Although the ferocity of the bombing was criticized as racist and unjustified elsewhere in the world, it was never a big story back home. U.S. press coverage of the air war focused, instead, on “MiG alley,” a narrow patch of North Korea near the Chinese border. There, in the world’s first jet-powered aerial war, American fighter pilots competed against each other to shoot down five or more Soviet-made fighters and become “aces.” War reporters rarely mentioned civilian casualties from U.S. carpet-bombing. It is perhaps the most forgotten part of a forgotten war.

The Kims, though, have kept memories of the war and the bombing terrifyingly fresh.

The US dropped more bombs on NK, than they did during the entirety of world war 2. 

It's the reason the North give for continuing hostilities. That because of the destruction America rained down on them, they can't trust the US, and that the US continues this war through sanctions. 

South Korea was also not "" better off than North Korea "".

NK experience better growth than SK for a long time. Things started to fall when America and Japan began investing in SK, and when the USSR fell, NK lost it's only major trading partner. This was the primary cause of the famine in the 90's which maintains food shortages to this day because due to sanctions, they could not update their infrastructure. 

NK actually tried to go capitalist in the 80's but America refused.

&gt; Vietnam would have been better off if the South won instead of the communist north

This is just personal opinion, and is not an argument. 

&gt; America helped protect both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia from an Iraqi invasion. The first Gulf War was completley justified.

No. No it was not.

America used Kuwait and KSA to further it's own purposes. Remember, it started funding Saddam when the US felt they could use him against Iran ?
 
&gt; Although many point to the US supporting coups and right wing dictators throuhgout the Cold War, I beleive that these actions were jusitifed given the context of the Cold War.

Really ? Just one example. Supporting the contras, with their hundreds upon thousands of instances of brutal rape, massacre and torture whose effects still linger to this day was a good thing ?

[Here's on video where two intellectuals debate this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXY6E7wCZZs)

&gt; The war in Afghanistan was completely justified.

I disagree.


&gt;  however this narrative overlooks the fact that the Afghan government was harboring terrorists

If that was a criteria, the US should have invaded itself.

Keep in mind, the terrorists they referred to here, were freedom fighter years before.

&gt; The Iraq war was justified as well

No offence, but Jesus Christ it gets worse every point.

&gt;  It was recentley revealed that there were indeed WMD's in Iraq

No.

No it wasn't.

&gt; Saddam also used WMDS on the Kurds back in the 80's.


You mean the WMD's The US supplied him with ?

&gt; Moreover, Saddam's refusal to be transparent with respect to international investigators did nothing to assuage the concerns of the west.

Because they already confirmed there were no WMD's present.

&gt; So this was not just a neocon Bush belief

Bush Sr was before Bill.

&gt; Oil has nothing to do with the Iraq war either.


US-UK forces invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, seizing the major oilfields and refineries almost immediately. When coalition forces later entered Baghdad, they set a protective cordon around the Oil Ministry, while leaving all other institutions unguarded, allowing looting and burning of other government ministries, hospitals and cultural institutions. Looters sacked the National Museum and burned a wing of the National Library, but the Oil Ministry stood relatively unscathed, with its thousands of valuable seismic maps safe for future oil exploration.

President Bush quickly appointed Phil Carroll, a former high-ranking US oil executive, to assume control of Iraq's oil industry and on May 22, Bush issued Executive Order 13303 giving immunity to oil companies for all activities in Iraq and deals involving Iraqi oil. On the same day, under pressure from the US and the UK, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1483 which lifted the former sanctions and allowed the occupation authorities to sell Iraqi oil and put the proceeds in an account they controlled. Every step in the early post-war period confirmed the centrality of oil, not as an Iraqi national resource to be protected, but as a spoil of war to be controlled.",True,0,1512150736,,False,0,dqm9s5h,False,t3_7gqo7u,t3_7gqo7u,/r/changemyview/comments/7gqo7u/cmv_american_foreign_policy_since_1945_has_been_a/dqm9s5h/,1514237736,1,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,public,

this literally makes zero sense. One that's not how inflation works as basic economics shows that inflation rates under 5% create jobs due to export growth taking advantage of a weaker dollar. We currently have a Healthy inflation rate in the 2-3% range and have with few [exceptions for the past two decades](http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states.aspx).

Probably because we have a fuck load of houses already? 


&gt;Let's face it, when my parents could afford a house on a single blue collar wage, and people doing the same jobs today can't even afford to support themselves something has gone wrong.

Back when the rest of the world was still behind due to being wrecked in ww2. We were the factory of the world until the 70's. Guess what? unskilled labor is not hard to get. If you want a blue collar job that pays well you need a trade skill.

YouPCbra,,,"&gt; for the Flynn Effect to raise racial IQs of non Whites to Whites (would it also raise White IQ?) then wouldn't it just make more sense from a White perspective not to even bother?

Yes this is true but the scientists Flynn himself stated that African american Iq has been growing at 4.6ish% faster then whites in the last century. The idea behind this is that it is one thing to say we can improve conditions and it is another thing to write off entire groups of people as being unchangeable which would lead to some scary conclusions/possibilities. As for the why bother ? Well it is still a possibility that an ethnostate may not exist and that improving various group's iq within the states themselves may be a possibility that is if eugenics doesn't make a comeback.  

&gt;That surprises me. What makes up this 31%? Are they travelers (holiday/vacation)? Scientists? If they are not Muslims and they are not Arabs or even Citizens what are they doing in Saudi Arabia? 

Most are workers that are employed in some sector but stay due to increased salary compared to their home country . Nurses from the Philippines , doctors from Syria, Egypt and Europe, nuclear engineers from South Korea , IT from Pakistan and India etc. As for the make up its quite diverse but a good chunk of the 31% are Muslim yes ,but certainly not the overwhelming majority. These people are of interest to Saudi Arabia and thus stay and coexist because of that and that reason alone. It is a relationship of mutual benefit but there is hardly any intermingling between the populations .It is economic integration in possibility its pure form. The Saudis way of life and living standard is not threatened so they care little , however its also important to understand that the 31% are in some aspects the elite of their respective nations and a far better at working with the system. There are also NO social benefits for these workers so if you are invited then you are an asset not a burden.  This however also includes the sad case of migrant workers on construction and other projects who are in some sense slaves. 

&gt;I must have got some bad information somewhere then. Apologies.

Its no problem ,understandable really. The Saudis and gulf states work but are hardly an industrious people when compared to Germany or Poland that honor goes to the elite Arabs pulling the economic strings of the region. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFpHUzNomlc . Found a video focus on the emir that revolutionized the country the elite arab. 

&gt;Really? I knew that they were trying to shift their economy before the oil runs out but I hadn't thought that they had successfully done it yet, at least not to that degree. Do that many people really visit Dubai that tourism outranks their oil output? 

Dubai the city or the UAE the state has deep trade relations with Britain and the whole of Europe due to its historic position on the gulf as a trading port. Keep in mind this is ONLY THE UAE other gulf states are still heavily reliant on oil as their main export and are working to make the shift to diversify their economy and copy the UAE model. This is happening due to the all too real reality that oil won't sustain them forever and they are fully aware of this. Tourism is also a good chunk of their gdp. Check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxa0UDeU7t0 sorry turns out in 2010 only 1% of their gdp was oil .

No relax, no widespread Islamic state, military jihad or sharia law  if I came to live in your area lmfao. 

We are very close in age but I do see a similarity in the preference with the groups . In my school it was mainly the blacks whom hung out with each other , oddly enough though no other group had a preference despite being present in number.  

Also I've taken a deeper look at white farmers in certain regions in Africa and yes I must agree it is abhorrent. I must also add that it seems Africa has always been less welcoming to other cultures then anything I've witnessed or read about. 35,000 Armenians fleeing from the ottomans were welcomed with open arms in Syria despite being christian and this was over 100 years ago when the country was far more conservative. Today they number more then 100,000 . I'm truly interested in why this isn't the case for sub Saharan Africans. Could it perhaps be IQ I wonder ? 

Even the regional conflicts with sunni and shia muslims are largely political and I can assure you you would almost never come across shia and Sunni Muslims who hate each other as individuals and lived peacefully for many periods in history. 

In any case that last part was me attempting to get your take on it.

Want some more information as to how Flynn was cornered? Because Flynn was getting fucked from so many angles, not just Russia. Reza Zarrab, a Turkish citizen, recently plead guilty to charges of conspiring to avoid sanctions.^[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/world/europe/reza-zarrab-turkey-trial.html?referer=) This story involves Turkish president Erdogan, a kidnapping plan, firing New York Attorney General Preet Bharara, and Trump allies Giuliani and Mukasey providing legal counsel for Zarrab. Flynn's hand was forced, he was forced to cooperate due to the events that took place over the past month.

Reza Zarrab will be an important player because of Gulen. Gulen is the Turkish cleric hiding in the United States that Erdogan and the Turkish government are after. They allegedly offered Flynn a $15 million deal to kidnap him. But that was only 1 of 2 topics Flynn discussed with his Turkish counterparts during their meeting. The second topic was, allegedly, discussing the release of Reza Zarrab who is being tried by the United States government for conspiring to violate sanctions.^[[2]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-turkey-cares-about-trial-reza-zarrab)

We know that Zarrab plead guilty to the charges he faced and is now cooperating with authorities.^[[3]](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/michael-flynn-reza-zarrab-trump-investigation-mueller-turkey-businessman-a8080671.html) We found out that Jared Kushner had met with Special Counsel Mueller last month to discuss Michael Flynn.^[[4]](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/jared-kushner-special-counsel/index.html) We also know that Flynn's lawyer broke communication from Trump's legal team, indicating that Flynn was ready to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller.^[[5]](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/michael-flynn-break-trump-team-mueller-1.4417243)  We know  that Flynn's lawyer had met Monday morning with members of Special Counsel Mueller's team, another indication that he was ready to cooperate.^[[6]](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynns-lawyer-meets-members-special-counsels-team/story?id=51412187)

I recommend reading the Lawfare post, it does an excellent job in summarizing who Zarrab is and why he is so important to this investigation. Below I have included some interesting tidbits from the article with many familiar names. 

&gt;In recent weeks, there has been increasing American interest in a previously little-watched judicial saga unfolding in New York district court. Like a Turkish soap opera, it involves a dashing businessman with a pop-star wife, corruption allegations, leaked tapes of private conversations and intrigue at the highest levels of government. The trial of Reza Zarrab on charges of evading Iran sanctions, including any revelations he makes about corruption in the Turkish government, could have significant political and economic implications for Turkey. It could also damage already fraught relations between Turkey and the United States.  

&gt;In events surrounding Zarrab’s trial, interactions between the U.S. government and Turkish officials raise rule of law questions for the United States. Erdogan has taken a strong personal interest in Zarrab, discussing him on multiple occasions with the Obama and Trump administrations. **He demanded Zarrab’s release and Bharara’s firing in a meeting with then-Vice President Biden in 2016,** while his wife pleaded the case to Biden’s wife. Erdogan raised Zarrab in his final phone calls with Obama in Dec. 2016 and Jan. 2017. **It was a topic of discussion between Erdogan and Trump as well.** Following a September phone call, Erdogan said Trump told him the case in New York was not under his jurisdiction.

&gt;Eyebrows have been raised over connections between the Zarrab case and the Trump administration. In March, Trump fired Preet Bharara, the U.S. District Attorney who brought the indictment against Zarrab. (Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked 46 U.S. attorneys to resign. Bharara refused, noting Trump had asked him after the election to remain. Trump called Bharara; he declined to answer, citing rules against sitting attorneys talking to the President. Trump then fired him.) The case has continued under Bharara’s former deputy and current Acting District Attorney, Joon Kim.

&gt;Also in March, Zarrab made changes to his legal team. He hired **Rudy Guiliani,** an informal Trump advisor, and **Michael Mukasey,** a former Attorney General. **These lawyers met with Erdogan and senior Trump administration officials in search of a “diplomatic solution.”** Guiliani described his role in a deposition as determining “whether this case can be resolved as part of some agreement between the United States and Turkey that will promote the national-security interests of the United States and redound to the benefit of Mr. Zarrab.”

&gt;In addition, there are questions about **Michael Flynn’s possible involvement.** Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, is exploring Flynn’s Turkish activities. Flynn, a Trump campaign advisor and briefly U.S. National Security Advisor, was allegedly offered $15 million to return Gulen to Turkey. **Mueller is reportedly examining whether Flynn also discussed ways of freeing Zarrab from court charges.**

OnigriziaOmorti,SOAF,South Africa,"Besides empty words, like a Ghanian writer once wrote:

&amp;nbsp;

*""One of the main reasons for the continuing underdevelopment of our country is our nonchalant attitude to time and the need for punctuality in all aspects of life. The problem of punctuality has become so endemic that lateness to any function is accepted and explained off as* ['African time.'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_time)

&amp;nbsp;

Africans need to start taking accountability for Africa affairs and need to remove those African liberation organisation that have hijacked the independence from their previous colonisers to benefit themselves and maintained the status quo. We cannot have Europe and Europeans continuously coming to the aid of a Africa where everything seems to be a slow motion train wreck waiting to happen.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Then one of course see things like this and wonder.

[Panama Papers: Africa's elite are plundering their countries](http://m.dw.com/en/panama-papers-africas-elite-are-plundering-their-countries/a-41004488)

For example:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Togo, for example, is home to vast reserves of phosphate directly managed from the offices of president **Faure Gnassinge, whose family have ruled the West African country for 50 years. Togo earns 40 percent of its export earnings from the mineral, which is crucial for making fertilizers. The investigation found that phosphate would generate more wealth if it weren't being sold for two thirds of the going rate** to a ""shady"" shipping family called Gupta. (The consortium behind the report is researching if this Gupta family is connected to South Africa's Guptas - more about them below.)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""We are critical of the total lack of transparency in the management of the phosphate industry in Togo,"" said journalist Domegni. **In a country where more than 80 percent of the population live under the poverty line, ""those benefiting from [phosphate] are those who manage the country with the complicity of their friends,**"" he said.

Liberal left leaning people probably like the idea of equality and the chance for people to seek a better life in the UK, so they will support some migration and immigration.  It's hyperbole to say that they support *mass* immigration though.  

Left wing people can also be traditionalists as well though, and not be that fond of immigration.  And social conservatives will object to immigration because they see that it dilutes social values etc. they hold dear.  Most of these people are just a bit old fashioned but racists and xenophobes are an extreme examples of this on both sides. 

However fiscal conservatives *love* the free market and they *love* immigration because of the competition it brings for both skilled and unskilled labour. 

The Conservative party is in theory socially Conservative, but many of them are aggressive fiscal conservatives and their funding definitely is.  So whilst they are currently talking a nice game on immigration and British values etc I don't buy it.  The money behind them wants more immigration, not less.

Hence the 2009 Pandremix colossal narcolepsy fuck-up.  

One fifth of the European population carries a dormant gene for narcolepsy.  One out of five.  Not that they'll necessarily GET narcolepsy, but that they carry a piece of DNA that can be activated to cause it.  

2009's European swine flu vaccine contained an adjuvant - Pandemrix - that subsequently induced manifestation of narcolepsy in a thousand European children.  A permanent, debilitating condition that will cripple these children forever.  

How did it happen?  The vaccine adjuvant affected that dormant gene (that one in 5 Europeans carry) and triggered it.

European children receiving this vaccine (who had this gene variation) were up to 13 times (depending on the country) more likely to become narcoleptic.  Forever.  The end.  

It's not just an allergy.  The vaccine actually interacted with personal genetics to cause this tragedy.  

This one was obvious after so many kids started showing symptoms of the disorder so soon after vaccination.  Who knows to what level other interactions are taking place when your kids get their vaccines.

Daniel Alves already said multiple times he doesnt even care if the team end up winning or not. And he is not the best defending side back.

The center backs are a joke. David Luiz is gone. Thiago Silva is just bad and insecure. Him crying in 2014 was the most pathetic scene i ever saw in football. Miranda is old.

I've already acknowledged that the terms have different meanings in Europe

Those meanings are common in the US as well. 

&gt;Antifa are socialists, not anarchists.

They are both. They are the [syndicalists](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2465?rskey=ASdtRc&amp;result=1). Marx was an anarchist, in a way, but the syndicalists did not believe he was anarchist enough as he believed in a rule by the proletariat. By contrast, syndicalists believed in no rule other than that of the natural law. However, they believe that in an anarchist state that people would form communes by which everyone would share the fruits of their labor. They pose that this is the natural order of things. Of course, this is quite obviously not how people work. But that doesn't change that their beliefs are anarchists.

&gt;They don't live with no rules, they want everyone to live under their rules.

Anarchist doesn't mean ""no rules."" [Here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/) is a reading of what anarchism is. But antifa does want no rules... They want no rules to exist at all and support violence for their cause. A common theme in anarcho-syndicalists. It is a rule without rules, in a sense, but they believe in a natural law where their communes will come out superior and they believe there will be no need of government. Again, they are quite obviously wrong in this belief.

People being upset about how Jamaicans can have a different definition of white/black than Americans. 

Americans calling someone black when they have 25% African ancestry is okay, but apparently calling someone who is clearly mainly with European ancestry Caucasian is an ignorant act.

You act as if the way the US treats race is the only correct way to do it. You're essentially saying that there is some logical basis as to why someone who's 50% white and 50% black is considered black, and think that anyone who thinks they're white is ignorant. In reality, there is no logical reason why we call someone 50-50 as black. We maybe possibly would refer to them has half-black (stand alone), but we don't call them half-white (stand alone).

Why is white neutral? Why is white the default? Why is it that other races are the ones that we highlight? Could it possibly be because we're in a country mainly run by (especially historically) by white people? Where white people are traditionally the majority and the most powerful? Like how black is the neutral, default in Jamaica? Therefore being a high portion of white being highlighted is perfectly natural for them?

Bobsdobbs757,virginia,VA,"So, Russian ambassador asked Flynn who has very little power about sanctions being lifted while later on down the road Trump seeks sanctions harsher than Europe wanted upon Russia.

&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/08/why-europe-opposes-the-uss-new-russia-sanctions/535722/ European leaders have been vocal in their opposition to the bill since it was approved by the House last week, albeit for different reasons. **European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned of potential collateral damage to Europe’s energy market, as the sanctions could inadvertently hit European companies involved with Russia’s energy-export pipelines.** One such pipeline, the Nord Stream 2, which aims to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, involves several European companies. “‘America First’ cannot mean that Europe’s interests come last,” Juncker said, adding that the Commission would be ready to act “within a matter of days” if their concerns were not addressed. Germany, in a separate warning, suggested the U.S. was using the sanctions as cover for its own natural-gas interests.

To add some context.. 50% of all Russian exports are oil and gas related with half all exports going towards European Union. Making any sanctions desired by Europe an idle threat and virtue signaling.
https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/

&gt;**By contrast in 2014, when the EU sanctioned Russian energy firms alongside the U.S. and Canada, gas was exempted due to numerous EU member states’ reliance on Russian supplies.** Even then, those sanctions came at a cost to the European economy—it’s estimated the sanctions cost the EU as much as 100 billion euros.
Moscow, unsurprisingly, registered its own objections. **Russian Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev proclaimed that Washington had declared a “fully-fledged trade war on Russia,” adding that “the hope of improving our relations with the new U.S. administration is dead.”** **He further criticized Trump for demonstrating “complete impotence by humiliatingly transferring executive powers to the Congress, which changes the balance of power in U.S. political circles.”**

So Trump and Congress wanted to cripple Russia further than EU wanted and somehow Trump is still a Russian puppet.

Mordiken,EURO,European Union,"&gt; ""Clean diesel"" is a myth that was used to create a protectionist diesel market for passenger cars in Europe.

You're ignoring the fact that Europe pays a higher price for oil than the US, and diesel is much cheaper to produce than gas per liter, and diesel gets better millage.

""Europe"" didn't push anything. The consumers opt for diesel, because it it's both cheaper (because it's cheaper to manufacture) and diesel cars get better mileage. It's not like there aren't gas cars on sale, it's just that until fairly recently buying them was stupid, because they got half the mileage of a similarly specked diesel car.

Japanese imports thrive in Europe. So does Korean imports. So does American brands that make products targeting the European fuel cost reality, like Ford. And so will Tesla.

valcry,,,"&gt; I don't believe we're taking a hard stance, simply a logical one that points out the inconsistencies of the British government's position so far. 

Is it logical though? One can very easily point out the inconsistencies between causing a collapse in the talks and not wanting a hard border as well. 

Realistically there is very few options that don't result in a hard border . There can be a sea border between NI and rUK, there can be a sea border between Ireland and the EU there can be a border between NI and Ireland or there can be some sort of deal that allows for no border between the UK and the EU (unlikely but hey). Two of those options are impossible, one is what everyone is attempting to avoid and the other requires the talks to progress. Maybe there is another option that hasn't been pointed out yet but i haven't heard of it yet. 

By collapsing the talks in December (and that is pretty much what this achieves) you take away the option that has a chance at no border and only leave the options that do have a boarder. That why, to me at least, Ireland position is illogical with their stated goals. Their  actions are guaranteeing a hard border when that is what they supposedly want to avoid. 

&gt; The RoI/NI border issue, which doesn't seem to have appeared in even the top five considerations during the general Brexit campaign, is the #1 concern for us here, so please be assured that our current stance is the one we believe will achieve the best result in this regard

Then i would have to argue that Irish politicians are as deluded as British ones. The current stance guarantees the worst result, no chances for anything else. While i would of liked for there to be more focus on the issue of NI during the Brexit debate, and it is a disgrace that there wasn't, that has come and gone now. The situation now leaves very few options that wont result in a hard border, with pretty much all of them being killed off if things don't progress. 

There can be no guarantee given as it is all based on the future relationship, yet we can't talk about the future relationship, yet we can't talk about the future relationship with out a guarantee.

Ebből a baloldali félelemből lesz aztán a „safe space” meg a többi aberráció...

Legyen szabad mindenről statisztikát vezetni (öntsünk tiszta vizet a pohárba: minden probléma megoldásának első lépése a probléma valódi megismerése) és abba fogom hagyni az anekdotázást ebben a témában ígérem.

&gt; Szerintem semmi meglepő nincs abban hogy egy 19 éves egyetemista hajlamos a túlzásokra mindkét oldal irányában

Persze csak én pont nem erről beszéltem hanem a tanáraikról akik az agymosást végzik, a mainstream médiáról és a teljes baloldali politikai elitről.
Például Kanadában nemrég fogadtak el egy törvényt ami arra kényszerít mindenkit hogy a transzfesztitákat csakis az általuk választott valamelyik 83 új gender pronoun-nal szólíthatssák (pl. „zhe” v „zher”) különben vét a törvény ellen és eljárás indul ellene „under provincial human rights laws”:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#Of_Bill_C-16

Ez a kanadai professzor Jordan Peterson hosszasan beszél a youtube-on arról (ott óriási sztár lett nemrég, érdemes követni értelmes csávó) hogyan szállta meg és mára uralja teljesen a nyugati egyetemeket ez a posztmodernista söpredék - érdekes módon pont amit én is tapasztaltam.

Egy másik példa: Obama teljes mértékben elhiszi azt a genderista hazugságot hogy ma Amerikában egy nő ha ugyanazt a munkát végzi mint egy férfi csupán 79%-át kapja a férfi fizetésének.

„Obama said it was time for tough action to close the gender pay gap. Women still earn just 79 cents to every dollar paid to a man more than 50 years after the passing of the Equal Pay Act designed to stamp out gender pay discrimination.

“We’re talking about folks doing the same job but being paid different,” the president said in a speech in White House. “What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?”

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/obama-outlines-rules-for-closing-gender-pay-gap

Ez a csávó az USA elnöke volt 8 évig Trump előtt.

Tehát azt állítani hogy ezek a baloldali vadhajtások csupán 19 éves csitrik hormonális felindulásból elkövetett tetteire szorítkoznak a valóság olyan szintű nem-ismerésére vall hogy nehéz megérteni „honnan jössz” hacsak nem hordassz egy nagyon durva baloldali szemellenzőt.

&gt; Mostanra már talán jól ismert tény, hogy a másod- és harmadgenerációs ""bevándorlók"" nagyobb arányban radikalizálódnak, mint a tényleges bevándorlást végző szüleik

És hogyan keletkeznek vernazza szerint a harmadgenerációs bevándorlók?

Talán a gólya hozza őket?

Esetleg nem véletlenül az első generációs menekültek leszármazottai? Akkor viszont meg hogyan lehet komoly arccal olyat leírni hogy „tehát az első generációs menekültek nem veszélyesek” mikor belőlük lesz az a réteg aki mlg vernazza szerint is terrorista lesz?

Mi a garancia arra hogy lehet bárkit is asszimilálni? Miért nincs szó sosem a bevándorlók felelősségéről az integrációban („kettőn áll a vásár”)? Mennyibe kerül egy társadalomnak a sok bevándorló? Hajlandóak volnánk egyálatlán ennyit költeni erre ? Miért nem kérdezik meg a többségi társadalmat mielőtt rájuk szabadítják a fél világot (szerintem ez volna a minimum)?

Az pedig tény hogy a Sharia törvények összeférhetetlenek és összeegyeztethetetlenek a felvilágodás utáni európai értékrenddel és a mára a legtöbb (nem muszlim) országban elfogadott általános emberi szabadságjogokkal úgy mint a szólásszabadsággal (Allahot nem szabad kritizálni - sőt még magát Mohamedet lerajzolni sem szabad amint azt a dán karikatúristánál láthattuk halál jár érte!), nők jogaival (előírják nekik hogyan öltözzenek, a férfi megverheti a nőt ha hűtlenséget gyanít), melegek jogai („Homosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam) akkor ilyen apróságok hogy ha egy iszlám hitű elhagyja a hitét akkor azért halálbüntetés jár. **Ezek csupán azok az alapok amit a mérsékelt muszlimok is osztanak emiatt már ők sem integrálhatóak.**

„78% of Muslims thought that the publishers of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed should be prosecuted, 68% thought those who insulted Islam should be prosecuted and 62% of people disagree that freedom of speech should be allowed even if it insults and offends religious groups„

http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/291

Tehát egyáltalán nem igaz amit írsz hogy csak néhány szerencsétlen „bad apple” a probléma. Nem.

A mérsékeltek iszlám hívők IS a probléma részei.

https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/10-reasons-not-peace.aspx

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AkAGc5nOXw

A mai keresztényeket pedig nem lehet a mai iszlám hívőkhöz hasonlítani:

1, leszarják a Bibliát, senki nem fog gyilkolni az ótestamentumi Isten nevében ez a veszély egész egyszerűen nem létezik

2, nincs utánpótlás lassan nem lesz pap mert senkit nem érdekel az egész a fiatalok körében (a muszlimoknál az a minimum ha az apád muszlim volt te is az vagy teljesen mindegy mit szeretnél) miközben az átlag gyerekszám is gyatra a muszlimokhoz képest

3, a keresztény kultúra az európai történelmi fejlődés szerves része (sokak szerint az alapja). Az iszlám nem az, sőt, Európa egyik legfőbb történelmi ellensége volt sokáig (spanyol reconquista, török hódítások Kelet-Európában)

Gyakorlatilag van a szerencsétlen elmebeteg izolált Breivik akire az iszlám szerecsenmosdatói tudnak mutogatni hogy „lám a keresztények sem különbek” meg néhány szintén izolált szekta amerikában és kész kifújt ennyi.

Mi közben az EU-ban 2015 óta lassan megszokjuk hogy nem telik el szinte hónap egy újabb iszlám terorista merénylet vagy próbálkozás nélkül. Eközben a német hírszerzés feje azt mondja lehetetlen ennyi embert megfigyelni amennyit beengedtek, túl sok a potenciális terrorista.

Mi a megoldás?

Szerintem egyértelmű: nem beengedni a muszlim tömegeket. 

Nyugat Európának már késő, ők egyék meg amit főztek számukra egyszerűen már nem opció semmilyen szép megoldás:

1, Vagy a vernazzai úton mennek végig: miközben a helyi álértelmiség a szokásos „ez egy bonyolult probléma” hangzatos üres lózunggal a szőnyeg alá söpri a problémát (azaz nem csinál semmit) a muszlimok szépen túlszülik a helyi lakosságot és pár generáció múlva megkerülhetetlen politikai erő lesznek, végül kalifátust csinálnak Nyugat-Európából

2, Vagy deportálnak minden muszlimot aki a Sharia törvényeket tekinti mérvadónak 

Egyik sem szép de ez a kialakult tragikus szituáció a Merkelek és vernazzák történelmi bűne.

cmetz90,,,"I agree that George RR Martin does a much better job than the show at the geographic realities of the size of Westeros than the show. He pays much more attention to things like travel time and just the struggle to rule such a large kingdom (or even just knowing what’s going on at the fringes.)

But I do think there’s some weirdness around how culturally homogenous Westeros is. According to GRRM, Westeros is about the size of South America (though a more common fan analysis puts it at the somewhat smaller size comparable to Western Europe) and only has three religions and two languages. Some of that can be explained as a result of colonization by Andals, but that still means that the First Men, a population spread across a continent from before history was recorded, were basically a mono-culture.

To head off the onslaught of arguments that I *always* get when I bring this up, (1) I don’t think it hurts the fiction at all, in fact I quite enjoy ASOIAF, and (2) I know that there are some potential in-universe justifications. But, from an authorial perspective, what I think happened is GRRM just sort of scaled up the size of the War of the Roses (his real-world inspiration.) I mean, Great Britain + Ireland + France has about the cultural diversity of the “modern” Seven Kingdoms.

Ultimately it’s fine, I don’t expect my authors to be experts in migratory history or population density or whatever. And really, I don’t think ASOIAF would benefit from being bogged down by more details and history.

Treaty-wise you're right, but in European politics you should look further than the treaties.

Generally the Commission looks at complying to those motions the last few years and avoid legitimacy issues publically. Except when they have backing from the CoM do they generally omit EP motions.

&gt; Ireland, which is looking for written commitment that there will be no return to a hard border with Northern Ireland, has threatened to veto progress if Britain does not come up with a satisfactory and concrete offer this weekend.

&gt; &amp;quot;We can work through this. We want to listen to unionism.

But the deputy PM warned that Ireland would remain stubbornly firm on the issue of the hard border and was prepared to pull the trigger on the Brexit talks.

pisshead_,,,"&gt; What we do know is the basic fact that reusable rockets cost more upfront but get cheaper the more often they can launch the same stage over and over again.

Except the Falcon 9 was cheaper even before re-use. Unless you're privy to insider SpaceX financials then you don't know how much it saves them to re-use a rocket. The only thing Ariane has going for it is the subsidies which SpaceX doesn't get. They claim Ariane 6 will be cheaper but a rocket in the hand is worth two in the bush, and SpaceX isn't getting more expensive. 

&gt;And there lies the big problem, the European space market isn't as big as the American and even worse, while the American government (and Russian and Chinese) is forced by law to only buy American rockets, European governments are not.

Well, there are no European launchers, Ariane is a French company and most European companies have little or no stake in it. Forcing Europeans to use European rockets would give Ariane a monopoly because there is no competition in Europe, unlike in America where there are three launch providers and soon to be four. There's no reason the European space market should be smaller than the American one, Europe is rich and has a lot of people.

&gt;Germany is going to launch new intel satellites on a Falcon 9, the US government would never ever launch a spy satellite on an Ariane rocket, even if it would be cheaper or better suited for the mission.

America is launching the JWST on the Ariane 5 so you're not being entirely honest there. Germany doesn't have a launch provider anyway, they have to go foreign. Without Falcon 9 a lot of European countries wouldn't be able to launch things because Ariane 5 is expensive and has a huge backlog.

YouShallKnow,,,"You said the US founders could have copied your country when I argued that we started this whole democracy thing, so it's kinda the alpha version.  If we could have copied your country, that implies you had a democracy no?  

The worst thing is that by 1776 your marginal democratic reforms were already wiped out and you had returned to absolute monarchy.  

&gt;When it comes to the pre Declaration of Independence you had a governor and a assembly of landowners that made the decisions. 

We had representatives from the colonies that had no requirement to be land owners and were democratically elected by land owners.  None of them carried titles of nobility and they could be and were recalled and replaced by their constituents.  

But your whole comment about the Declaration of Independance is misguided.  They didn't really decided anything other than to do it and on a list of complaints.  There was no governing done there aside from drafting a letter.  The genius and innovation was at the Constitutional Convention after our first governmental system, which was a loose confederacy similar to seperate states interacting in Europe, called the Articles of Confederation.  When that failed and needed revision, the Constitutional Convention took place over the summer of 1787 where the foundations of the world's first democracy was laid.  Delegates to the constitutional convention were democratically elected or chosen by governors who were democratically elected.  Again, no titles of nobility, just earning the respect of your countryman.  

&gt; Is this not a one chamber government with a “viceroy” at the helm. 

No, it did no governing.  They just drafted, voted on and signed a letter to the King.  You know, that thing you guys have always been too pussy to do.  You had to be gifted democracy by your nobility.  We took it with blood and sweat from the greatest empire the world had seen before us. 

&gt;When I stated that the 13 colonies legislation was mimic the European way of government.

How did they mimic them?  They all had democratically elected governors and legislatures.  The founders were specifically rebelling against the rule of kings of nobles in Europe, nobility never ruled any part of America ever.  

&gt;Are you aware that a parliamentary monarchy are classified as a democracy.

They can be, they aren't necessarily.  You had a democracy in 1866 for sure, regardless of suffrage.  But if you have nobility in control of the government, which you either had them or the king in charge until then.  

&gt; Sweden switched to parliamentary monarchy 1865. 

I would put that date back to 1709 when the Assembly of Estates, but whatever. 

&gt;You are a federal republic. Also a democracy.

Ok.

&gt;As stated 1909 is earlier then 1966 thus not a lie.....

What do you think happened in the states in 1966?  We had democracy from the get go and we had full suffrage 40 years before that.

SirCritical,daggerfall,"proud GM of the guild ""WEB""","* **Server:** EU - PC
* **Faction:** cross-faction
* **Type of Guild:** social, PvE, trading (if we have a trader, well, not this moment, but we're bidding always :))
* **Current member number:** 80+

&amp;nbsp;

**Our guild, the ""WEB"" (Wealth-Equality-Brotherhood)** is an international, English-speaking social (kind of) guild, founded in Spring 2015, now with more than 80 members, with 95% active in a a month, more than the half in 1-2 days. We were aiming to create a fun community based on thievery, sadly there wasn't any content implemented which would have helped this, so we reformed ourselves as a general guild. We could finish lots of in-guild trial-runs, and still planning more, including veteran runs also (on Mondays and Thursdays, starting at 9.00pm CEST). We could clear vAA, vHRC (speedruns also) and vSO HM; the main target is vMoL (one day in the future, after a lot more vet trial completions..... :)).

&amp;nbsp;

We have players with characters from every class, race, role and playstyle, we have members from all of the alliances, while we are mainly PvE-oriented, so this won't carry any real importance. We have some basic rules, mostly about friendly behaviour, no-drama, no-rudeness, respect etc. **Our players are friendly, social, chatty and (mainly) mature guys (and girls :)), lots of us with family, job and pet, so our frequent playing hours are in the evening.**

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR We need more active and chatty players**, it is better if you're above CP160, but it's not a problem if you're below it, we've never been against those members, who were quite newbies. If you want to be our member you should be active in the evening hours, able and keen to do group content, shouldn't be arrogant and disrespectful, or childish (while we are not against good humour). 

Have no fear if you're basic in English, we won't force you to use any Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software (while we have a Discord server); please just be quick in typing and reading :) The only exceptions are the trial runs: those need voice coordination, so at least you have to be able to listen and follow.
