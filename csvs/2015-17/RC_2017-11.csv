The collapse of the website, managed by the Cabinet Office and the Government Digital Service, was blamed on “unprecedented demand” for the service, with 515,256 online applications to register to vote recorded on 7 June (the previous record for the largest number of online applications received in a day was 469,047 on 20 April 2015).""

Hillary4GTMO,,,"Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

It is apparent that the shooter was mentally ill, and if that is not the case, we are being lied to about what really happened that night.  Here lies the problem; these religious extremist are killing because of the fact that other people have different belief systems, and live life in a way that is different from the way most Muslims do.

Suleiman_Shouaa,,[VERIFIED - TSKRS],"Hey,

Not sure if you're still looking but just in case..

I think my corp (Tuskers) could be a good fit for you. We’re a relaxed (no minimum activity levels, no CTAs, fly what you want, when you want etc.) mature solo/small gang PvP corp with an active community, where some members have been around for 5+ years. We use out of game comms (Slack) to communicate, which makes joining fights even easier - a simple ping means when you do log on, there's something going on. We use Mumble as our voice service of choice and during EU primetime we normally have 5-10 guys chatting away, with another 5-10 idling. 

Historically, we were a low sec pirate corp, but most of us have found more fun living in a Class 2 Wormhole with a static NS &amp; C5 for PvP &amp; logistics/PvE respectively. We think this wormhole offers the best mixture of logistics &amp; PvP - the direct NS gives us plenty of opportunity for fights (at the moment we are getting about 50-80 kills per day) and the C5 gives us decent logistics. 

We run a mixture of organised gangs &amp; impromptu gangs. Some examples:

Our first attempt at Covert Lokis, we killed two carriers (http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=150891 and http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=150894) in &lt;30 minutes and managed to get back into our wormhole before the locals collapsed it.
A few weeks later, we managed to kill a Rorqual + its sub-cap defensive fleets with minimal losses, despite fighting 3 gangs simultaneously (RR Hyperions, Cruiser Gang, Dread + Rorqual) - http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=152626. 
Later on, we dropped on another Rorqual (see a pattern!) but had to let it go in 20% hull as it recovered with 3 FAXes repping it &amp; 4 supercapitals shooting us. Despite that, we stayed on grid for 40 minutes and dropped quite a few fighters! http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=152666
Organised Drake roam last week, 11 vs ~60 people - http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=153926&amp;adjacent=1 + http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=153866&amp;adjacent=1

ormr_inn_langi,,,"Hehe, a nationalistic *bent*, just like the bjúgaldin. 

It's an interesting question, and it's actually what I'm doing my research on in historical linguistics and sociolinguistics. The short answer is both yes and no. Icelandic has always been in the fairly unique position of being a transplanted language in an isolated place that has had to accommodate new ideas from mainland Europe (and now from the rest of the world). This was always traditionally done by giving new meaning to old words, and creating new words through derivation and compounding (Icelandic is particularly inclined to neologisms by its very nature - it's easier to create new Icelandic words through any number of processes than it is in a lot of other languages). It wasn't always political, it was practical. But over the centuries the language has been used as a political and ideological tool, for instance during the campaign for independence from Denmark. These attitudes towards language purification aimed at eliminating all Danish influence from Icelandic, and the language itself became kind of fetishized as a symbol of nationhood. Ironically enough it was actually a Dane, Rasmus Christian Rask, who is most responsible for drumming up interest in Icelandic as the ""original"" and ""untouched"" Norse language, but that's a different story for a different time. 

So in that sense, yes, words like *bjúgaldin* are the creation of some nationalistic policies.

&gt; The European Union and Japan asked the United Nations on Tuesday to condemn North Korea for gross human rights violations, drawing a link between severe hunger endured by North Koreans and Pyongyang&amp;#039;s missile and nuclear programs.

&gt; North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test this year and test-fired a series of advanced missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, even as 18 million North Koreans, or 70 percent of the population, are struggling with food shortages.

&gt; The draft resolution condemns North Korea &amp;quot;For diverting its resources into pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles over the welfare of its people,&amp;quot; according to the draft text obtained by AFP. Over half of North Korea&amp;#039;s population face food shortages and nearly a quarter suffer chronic malnutrition, according to UN findings cited in the proposed measure.

He offers a few examples of Western thought being considered by non-Western philosophers.  That's directly from the article. 

I also think he addresses your point earlier on, when talking about how western philosophers at one time were much more open to Eastern or African thought.  Even mentioning that philosophers at the time thought philosophy itself originated in Africa or Asia and was given to the Greeks.  Doesn't that suggest reverence for non-European thought?

hehemyman,,,"&gt; . However, I challenge your viewpoint from the fact that if you change your arbitrary start year for your post, the results change drastically.

It's not arbitrary though. You have to draw a line somewhere because terrorist attacks 60 years ago aren't as pertinent to terrorist threats today. Where would you draw the line?


&gt; Since September 11, 2001, how many planes have been hijacked and flown into buildings as a result of Islamic terrorism?
&gt; None.

Yes, but modern terrorist threat experts anticipate a similar attack on a similar scale within the next generation.


&gt; Given your acceptance of statistics as part of your post, would you not consider the attacks on September 11, 2001 an outlier?

No, again if you consult terrorist experts the chance of another 9/11 like attack is very high in the near future.


&gt; Given that it has not happened in over 16 years (can you recall the last time this happened in the United States- as far as I know, it hasn't), security has changed dramatically for air travel, and passengers' mindsets are likely to have been forever altered in the event that someone attempts to hijack another plane, would you not consider September 11, 2001 to be the start of a new period of terrorism (including Islamic)?


Again, its not an outlier because the threat of another similar attack is still very high.


&gt; Sure, if you include the attacks on September 11, 2001, you're post is accurate regarding the United States. But if you don't include those deaths and consider them an outlier or the start of a new era of terrorism, your figures are either borderline or inaccurate.

You can't just disregard the death count of 9/11 when doing a terrorism analysis. That doesn't really make sense to me. I mean yes, outside of 9/11 Islamic terrorism isn't as bad(but I consider the Orlando shootings to be terrorist in nature- as do the professionals) and the numbers aren't as overwhelming.



I would even agree that the Islamic terrorism threat in America isn't nearly as bad as it is in Europe.

Fucking_That_Chicken,desitin,,"Hey Kuffar

Instead of sitting around on the internet all day, posting pointless messages and abusing yourselves to pictures of loose women, why not do something productive and surrender your lives to Allah?

Western society has become decadent, weak, and lazy, and is soon to collapse. The upcoming generation, people such as yourselves, want nothing more from life than to grow fat sitting around on computers all day, masturbating, drinking, and taking drugs. You allow your women to parade themselves on your streets dressed as common whores, and you are encouraged in this behaviour by corrupt politicians and absent new age parents while your societies and economies collapse around you.

Meanwhile the Muslim Ummah, or brotherhood, grows rich on oil wealth and our madrasas train the upcoming generation to serve Allah, and to fight, willing to give their lives if necessary for the cause. The 19 hijackers of 9/11 have surely earned their place in paradise as do the martyr bombers who strike daily into the heart of the devil state of Israel. We are living among you, in Europe and America, and we are outbreeding you day by day, slowly taking over.

Allah has a plan for each of us. He means us all to be good Muslims and live by his rules, as set out to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Your sinful lives and wicked ways go against His plans, and you will be tortured for eternity in hell for your iniquities. Repent now and revert back to the one true faith.

Where your joke of a faith, which no one in your society believes in anyway, tells you to love, be tolerant, and turn the other cheek, the Qur'an teaches us to ""Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them, capture and besiege them and prepare for them every kind of ambush.""

It also says ""Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies"".

How can you hope to win your futile so called 'war on terror' against us? You have become weak, and no longer willing or able to fight. You even elected a pacifist president with Muslim sympathies to try and placate us. He supports our plan to build a mosque as a monument at the site of our victory against you in New York. It's only a matter of time until we win. Even now your soldiers continue to die on the battlefields of Afghanistan, and for what? The moment you leave, it will be back to traditional Sharia law. Your technological advances count for nothing if all you do with them is watch porn and play video games. We will continue our jihad on the west, to maim and kill those who oppose or insult us. See the truth for what it is and revert to Islam immediately. It is your only hope of survival.

amici__ursi,,,"There it is, the self-righteous, flaccid attempt at bullying and insult out of vapid ignorance. I get that you types have to protect your feeble minds from reality, but those pathetic attempts at claiming your superior debt slavery ""education"" somehow makes you the supremacists you believe you are, just goes nowhere. 

I'm slightly perturbed, but mostly just entertained and waiting for Liberals to finally get things going instead of just relying on their passive aggressive abusiveness that works so well in creating and mentally enslaving Liberal victims. 

You should try thinking for yourself. Just because you can't synthesize information that aren't elite establishment propaganda talking points, doesn't make them wrong. Just stop for just a second and think about what you are parroting that elite PR propaganda, that immigration is the backbone of American history. Do also support the the other backbone of American history, slavery? They are functionally the same thing and serve the same purpose; to enrich and empower the wealthy while draining wealth and income from the working and middle class. There is only a difference between slavery and immigration by degree, not function and purpose. The purpose if in both cases the conversion of middle and working class wealth and income into 1% profits and income, largely simply through inflation. 

It's basic economic principles, yet the propaganda is so thick that the ""educated"" can't see the con right before their eyes and are so well trained that they make all sorts of rationalizations and excuses for how and why undermining the working and middle class is really actually a wonderful idea. ... as they whine and cry about low wages and unaffordable housing. It's really not all that different than when Democrats had people convinced that they should defend Slavery, while slavery utterly crushed the local economy for the working and burgeoning middle class. Because what's better for an economy than an never ending stream of low/no wage slaves you have to compete with. It's always rather bizarre how the most basic logic, let alone economics and math totally and utterly evades Liberal minded folks. 

Yup. I'm sure you have been convinced that slaved built the country. Because they were all expert craftsmen and skills artisans, right? They were laborers just as much as whites were in Europe at the same time under serfdom. Functionally and practically the same thing even though to different degrees. I know your mind has been filled with all sorts of communist, Marxist, anti-American nonsense you just have to believe is true and accurate information since you went into debt slavery for it, but I have to tell you, that shit your mind was filled with is overwhelmingly propaganda nonsense. I know you will reject that notion and I used to not understand it either, but the hard truth is that it's so. Whether you eventually come to that understanding or live a life in the fog of intentional deception you were immerse in. Nothing is a stronger narcotic that a belief you must be convinced is true or the whole framework of your life starts crumbling. 

So you are going to ""educate"" me and tell me which alternative society and culture to the western world is superior and which we should adopt? Which other culture has produced as much as the west again? I seem to not know that. Please ""educate"" me. Why is it then that all the non-westerners are trampling themselves in order to mooch and freeload off the west but NOWHERE in the whole world is the inverse true. The only thing close to that may be the example of Zimbabwe and South Africa begging white farmers to come back after driving them off their farms that immediately collapsed once Africans took them over and they didn't just magically run themselves. 

Man, you have been fooled. Sorry to break it to you. The world is NOT at all the way you have been made to believe. Look into the rates of assault and sexual assault and robbery and attacks even just for Peace Corp fools who head out to the third world and impose solutions that do nothing but make Liberals feel better about themselves while the locals usually don't even want the help, let alone being ""helped"" does nothing to generate a system of self-development. 

You are mistaken, I actually have quite a bit of ""formal education"" in socio-economics, political theory, and ""culture and its interplay with these other factors"". I have seen the world as it really is and I can assure you that the circle jerk halls of feckless academia is a damn illusion. Where are those results that all the academics have been working on for decade after decade? You know what they don't really tell you with any degree of honesty is the mountains of abject failure and decimation especially socio economics and development economics has left behind in its wake. It's fucked up how the ""help"" has a long legacy of doing the opposite and not only that, but making the systemic problems even more intractable. 

Decade and decade and decade after decade of Liberal ""help"" and all the places that were ""helped"" are essentially worse off when you fully account for the cost including opportunity cost and deferred improvements that could have been made without the ""help"". But they don't like pointing that out, because it makes people realize that academics are largely narcissistic psychopaths that have zero conscience for the damage they cause as long as they receive scholarly, academic, and peer recognition. African and Latin America are literally littered with a decades long legacy of utter failure other than making pontificating, self-important academics and NGOs rich. Go to DC and see where most of the money goes, where self-important academics and consultants and NGOs go on waxing philosophically and vapidly with nothing really to show for. That't the reality of the world, or at least the tiniest little sliver of the tip of the iceberg.  

It's quite ironic, because just as the world thought that Huntington's clash of civilizations was not going to come to fruition, Liberals had to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and set that conflict in full motion through that sheer and utter naive ignorance one can only find in pontificating halls of circle jerking academics. I'm sure, you believe the cult of academic ""education"" and effect impudent snobbery your education bestows upon you, after all, they have to make you believe that all that ""education"" you went into debt slavery was worth something and at the other end you are a far superior person than anyone else. I was there, I get it. 

I can assure you more conservatives have lived abroad far longer and had far more and far deeper interactions with foreign cultures through the military than Liberals and Democrats ever could even dream of having. But of course, tell yourself that Liberals are the jet setting (which by the way introduces exponentially more pollutants directly into the stratosphere than driving the biggest truck), worldly, smart, cultured, and educated sages they have convinced themselves they are.  It's quite ironic that as ""educated"" and ""worldly"" as Liberals think themselves to be, they can't seem to understand the concept that there is a difference between what people want you to believe and what their beliefs and objectives and motivations really are. 

I can assure you I have an education from the best schools in the world, regardless of what I spend a few seconds pounding out to you. You and those like you are the most dangerous thing to all of humanity, because you are not only not aware of what you are naive and foolish about, you have no idea you are naive and foolish in the first place. It's like The abduction of Helen, the Trojan horse, and Stalingrad all in one and you idiots have no clue what you have been marching humanity into ... but you are educated to the same degree that sicentologists are scientists.

&gt; Beyond the political and institutional cost that the failure of the procés has had for Catalonia, the delirium carried out by Carles Puigdemont and Oriol Junqueras also has serious consequences for the Catalan public coffers. Justice, thanks to the lawsuits filed this Monday by the State Attorney General, José Manuel Maza, already tracks the huge amount of money embezzled in the secessionist adventure.

faintpremonition,army,ARMY,"&gt; Fascism is only nationalist in the sense they appeal to nationalism to justify their militarism. In other words, Convincing Citizens to Support War 101. Every country of all ideologies has been doing that for thousands of years. If you argue that makes fascism nationalist then everything's nationalist.

No, you obviously don't know shit about the philosophy under girding fascism. Militarism is a feature of fascism because it's inspiring but fascism isn't inherently expansionist in its politics. (Hi Franco.)

Fascism is inherently nationalistic because it re imagines class struggle as national struggle between developed nations and emerging nations. That's at its core.

&gt;You are disingenuously conflating nazism and fascism because you have no other argument, nazism is exactly what says it is... nationalist socialism. Fascism, on the other hand, can exist with minimal nationalism.

No, you're wrong again, and in my previous couple of comments I was specifically talking about Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile and Italian fascism. Mussolini was a far more respected fascist, (you know before the war) and far more influential in developing fascist thought than Hitler ever was. Hitler's grand contribution was adding in explicit racism to fascism, something Mussolini never thought important to the political structure fascism.

&gt;The only difference between communism and fascism as far as I see it is fascism doesn't explicitly consolidate all economic power within the party.

Well, to be blunt, that's because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Fascism is a political system and communism is a stateless economic system that is intended to exist post politics. You are right to distinguish between the levels of economic control between fascism and *socialism* (which is a political system) in that fascism uses state ""guided"" capitalism, and socialism prefers a state run economy in place of capitalism of any kind.

&gt;Fascism tends to favor corporatism (ie pro-monopolies) and socialism is pretty much just one huge monopoly owned by the Party. It doesn't matter that the two tribalistic ideologues hate each other, they're very similar in practice.

We... agree. This is incredible! I'd niggle that they aren't very similar practice, but rather they are very similar in experience for the ""end user."" In practice they get to the same state of deprivation under different practices. It's (sorry to go back to analogies) like Sunni and Shia Islam. They vary wildly, but to anyone looking in on the outside it's all Islamic nonsense.

&gt;I like nationalism and self-determination-- 

Me too!

&gt;which is why I favor Catalonia over the EU's desires.

I favor Spain's desires over Catalonias desires because an autonomous region is, in my view ones step too low for where to federalize, and that Spain is the right size to be a federal polity. The EU is the wrong size.

&gt;*You prefer globalism and fascism*, which is why you want Spain to dominate over other cultures because that's the only way the EU will remain stable. I could give two fucks about the EU and would prefer they collapse.

This is not what I've said. Forget for a minute where globalism and fascism are incompatible views (find me a single instance of any of the big three fascist leaders having world domination plans), it's just flat out not true since I've explicitly said over and over again that I don't prefer fascism, or globalism, but rather federated republics that work on the level of the nation-state. 

When Spain invades France then we can talk about Spain getting too aggressive with the cultural dominion.

So to sum up:

EU: too big! No good.
Catalonia: too little, and whiny. No good!
Spain: juuuuuuuuust right.

This is not an endorsement of Spain's progressive policies, and I also think they should treat all of their citizens equally.

This thing you do where you attribute motives to me works so much better if you're just talking about me behind my back to someone else. But you're not. It's just you and me here. Literally no one else in the universe is following our disagreement. Why do you think it's at all effective rhetorically to tell me I believe things that I've said over and over again that I do not. ""Well if you think (this one thing) then you obviously believe (some absurd extreme)"" is not a functional argument and it can only ever work to anger the other person or make them think you are too stupid to understand what they are saying.

nyckidd,,,"AMF is a Western charity that does work in African countries against malaria. One of the main reasons why malaria is such a problem in those countries is the low level of economic development. The low level of economic development exists in large part because of the systematic pillaging of African nations by other countries from the European scramble for Africa, to the gutting of African economies by the IMF with structural adjustment programs, to the current Chinese neo-colonial enterprise there. 

The Republican party endorses a more aggressive and less empathetic foreign policy than the Democratic party. With the Democrats in power we would be more likely to have a more humanistic stance towards African countries. Climate change also plays into this as poorer countries are far more likely to be more severely damaged by climate change, particularly in Africa due to drought and food scarcity. Therefore, your vote for the Democratic party is important if you care about helping people in Africa.  

Now obviously, one vote isn't enough to make all that happen. But sustained support for a political party over years is, and all it takes is a couple votes a year at most. Now, where I live, it doesn't take two hours to vote, and it is certainly a problem that it takes you that long. I happen to be in favor of making election day a national holiday so that it is as easy to vote as possible. But either way, I think that there is a very good case to be made that making voting a habit is worth the cost. 

Also, your argument about car accidents doesn't sway me at all. Any time you get in a car you have a risk of having an accident. I'm sure sports games cause accidents too, that doesn't mean people should stay home out of fear of dying on the way to one. And plenty of people don't drive to get to the polls. My dad walks around the corner because he lives in the city and its a few blocks away. I bike to my polling place. 

Oh and one more thing. One marginal person not voting does have an effect on the rest of us. Every person that doesn't vote for the Democrats is making a choice to support the worsening of the climate crisis. To me that is grossly irresponsible.

tuxxer,,,"At the time of its airing , it had a fairly good following. Personally I thought it was a complete waste of time, as I was hoping it would have been a prequel show to agents of shield. Alas, not to be. 

Agents of Shield had the budget, and if Agent Carter had access to the same cash flow, it could have been a better show. Instead of being set in Europe and traveling around collecting sciencey and occult esoterica that Hitler and co., had been hoarding to win the war, perhaps scooting down to south america looking for hydra / SS operatives looking to restart. Doing her own investigation into what happened to Steve Rogers.  Lastly starting up Shield.

Nope, they are on a back lot shooting New York, and LA. Could they have been transferred from the OSS to the FBI and doing sciencey stuff for them, oh no, they have to set up some sort of parallel FBI operation.

So in short, it could have pulled in a lot of folks that were fans of Shield and kept them, but in the end  they only had a fraction of those viewers and ABC was doing the Math and they had a new president coming in that did not like the Marvel stuff.

So no, Europe pays less and taxes more. Especially France.

It's great that you don't get that Europe is also much smaller than the US and has different problems. The continent had to be destroyed by war and communism and eventually just surrender most of its defense to NATO(the US) to have anything resembling social programs. And even those are being scaled back because of how bad they're going to turn out.

Maarek_Elets,,,"Doing the same things as me? Do you seriously believe that anyone who doesn’t agree with your agenda is a racist? 

For every stupid white supremacist march out there there have been 2 or 3 antifa/BAMN riots which have been seeped in violence and in fact exist in order to commit violence in name of their cause. 

Also you spout a major false equivalence there, Despite my personal disdain for the confederate flag,  I also personally know many people who find some kind of identity in the flag for reasons completely separated from racism (that a few are African American and others are Hispanic is a key to that although several are of mostly European descent). If you talked with people like them you’d find that mostly they’d say it’s part of their home identity (all being from the South). I’ve had many arguments with them because I personally believe that flag is irredeemable but never has it devolved to me having to call them racists (or vice versa). We disagree but somehow there’s room in my reality to understand that their belief is no threat to mine. 

Back to the point, “supporting the confederate flag” does not make one a believer in white supremacy anymore than belief in democratic socialism makes one a communist. 

Also, just because Trump denounced all the violent psychopaths involved in the riots doesn’t mean he didn’t denounce the violent psychopaths you have an issue with.

kimberlyte,,,"Skinny tires are higher risk for pinch flats at that weight. At 260lb, I'd stick to 32mm or wider for a road bike. I flatted all the time on 23mm when I weighed around 225lb, and 25mm wasn't much better. Many road bikes cannot fit tires wider than 25mm or 28mm.

A bad fit sucks the fun out of riding, so find a bike which fits you properly. Riding without your hands on the bars is a bad idea in the long run, and you might want to consider something more upright like a European city bike. Your rides are so short that you should buy a bike that is built for comfort and not for speed. For commuting, I'd suggest getting something with fenders and a rack, and smooth, wide tires. Panniers are better for carrying loads than a backpack. Wider tires can be run at a lower pressure than skinny ones, giving a more comfortable ride.  

As an example, I run my mountain  bike with 2.25"" tires at 35psi through rock gardens, my commuter with 1.75"" to 2' wide tires at 45-60 psi (and jump off curbs with it), and my road bike with 28mm tires at 100psi (and try to avoid bumps on the road). That's at 200lb rider weight, so you will need to run higher pressures. On most bikes, the ride gets less comfortable and feels bumpier as the tire pressure increases. 

There are tire pressure charts out there which give recommended pressures for various rider weights and tire widths. You need enough pressure to avoid pinch flats and damaged rims. Use a gauge or ideally, a floor pump with a gauge. Proper inflation is an important factor in avoiding flats, and check at least weekly.

&gt;I’m all for expanding mainstream philosophy to include more non-Western thinkers and ideas. But only after we have it undergo the same scrutiny with which we have examined Western philosophy.

Again, *what* scrutiny? The current canon has practically zero scrutiny outside of tradition.

I'm all for more scrutiny, but I think you've got it totally backwards. The western hegemony on philosophy is *benefiting* from the absence of scrutiny. In the absence of any real grounding in reality or practical results, Eurocentric bias has enough room to define the entire academic focus.

If we had any *actual* scrutiny, most of the Western canon would be removed. Note that the sciences, which undergo a more objective sort of scrutiny, are international and filled with immigrants. A random science laboratory is *highly* diverse because the best and the brightest come from all sorts of places. If your ""best and brightest"" all come from one place it can probably means they aren't truly the best and brightest. Philosophy as a discipline can only afford to be so *provincially* European because it has no objective tests of mettle to meet.

3.) God knew that the Taino and other Caribbean tribes could not respond to Europeans the way the Iroquois or other Northern Pre-Colombians could.

They think that somehow a search engine is some kind of national service instead of just a search engine or a platform for Content delivery.

But, it's not like anybody could actually run a good search engine without advertising unless you paid some kind of usage fee for the search engine and the most reliable way for anyone to run that model with consistent income is probably going to be advertising.

So, the problem is that people don't want to pay for search engines that aren't advertising driven for profit self corrupting prophecies. Don't be evil!

You know when you had to make your company's slogan ""don't be evil"", that you probably have a questionable business model that's ventrally going to be prone to corruption.

For that same reason internet service providers should not also be trying to provide services Beyond internet. The potential for cross Market Corruption of the Integrity of the network for the sake of profits is far too high. Internet service providers should focus on just providing internet and doing so securely. It's not like they've even begun to master doing that yet. It's hard to see why they should be expanding on their role or Services when many of them have their systems misconfigured or lacking obvious security features that they should have. And instead they are busy trying to spy on users so they can try to justify not having to expand their networks, as if that is a reasonable strategy for the future.

As if their profits should be the determining factor of how much bandwidth we all need or use. They don't act like companies that are in anyway controlled by their consumers needs.

The right way to do this is that internet service providers just provide internet and search engine providers offer paid non advertising services. That way we can actually trust the results of the search engines instead of the search engines eventually being corrupted to be nothing more than advertising result rankers.

I would suggest each Nation sponsors funding for search engines within their own nation that don't require advertising as well as Private Industry offers search engines that don't require advertising and instead charge a fee. 

I can't see how you're ever going to have something as important as a search engine be run in tirely by advertising and not run into massive problems with this information for the sake of profits.

I suppose an open source donation run search engine might be the best, but really even those can be fully corrupted by people with money. At the end of the day one simple reality is that we need search engine diversity, but the search engines still need reasonable integrity. A service like duck duck grow seems great and all, but at the end of the day the search engine is filled with trash results because it's not run with all the filtering, funding and feedback required to make a good search engine.

&gt; The Dubliners was an Irish folk band founded in Dublin, Ireland, in 1962. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland's longest surviving musical act. Also in 2012, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The group announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012 following the death of founding member Barney McKenna (born 16 December 1939; died 5 April 2012). The surviving members of the group - with the exception of John Sheahan - continue touring under the name of ""The Dublin Legends"".

&gt; The Dubliners started off in O'Donoghue's pub in Dublin in 1962 under the name of ""the Ronnie Drew Folk Group"". Then they were four, Ronnie Drew (vocals and guitar), Luke Kelly (vocals and 5-string banjo), Barney McKenna (tenor banjo, mandolin, melodeon and vocals) and Ciarán Bourke (vocals, guitar, tin whistle and harmonica). In 1963, they played at the Edinburgh festival where they met the head of Transatlantic Records, Nathan Joseph, for whom they started recording. In 1964, Luke Kelly left, and Bobby Lynch (vocals and guitar) and John Sheahan (fiddle, tin whistle, mandolin, concertina, guitar and vocals) were added. When Luke Kelly returned and Bobby Lynch left in 1965, we have what is considered as the original Dubliners, five individualists, five men whose talents were mixed together in a superb blend and just wanted to play and have a good craic. If they only knew what was awaiting them!

&gt; In 1967 their major breakthrough came as a result of a coincidence. Their song, ""Seven Drunken Nights"" which was recorded in one take, was snapped up by a pirate radio station which started playing it along with the Beatles, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, the Who, the Kinks and Jimi Hendrix. Suddenly, The Dubliners was a major band, playing all over the world, getting into the charts, and receiving gold discs. Not what you expected from a bunch of hairy people who ""looked like they'd just been dragged out of a seedy bar via a hedge(backwards) and dropped on London from a very great height"".(Colin Irwin in the reissue of ""Live at the Albert Hall"")
The seventies started like the sixties ended; wild touring, drinking, playing. They started doing regular tours, and they were still recording, of course. Then, in 1974, Ciarán Bourke collapsed on stage with a brain haemmorrage, which eventually led to his death. He first, though, recovered remarkably , and was back on stage with The Dubliners, but collapsed again. At the same time, Ronnie decided to take a break, and Jim McCann took his and Ciaráns place in the group.

&gt; In 1979, Ronnie decided to make a comeback as a member of the group, although he probably never really left it. In the five years, he had recorded two solo albums, and The Dubliners three albums. With Ronnie returning, Jim left, and The Dubs were almost back where they started. Then Luke Kelly became ill, he collapsed on stage with a brain tumour, for which he received surgery several times. He too, made remarkable recoveries, and went on touring with the Dubliners, at the same time continuing his wild and unhealthy lifestyle. Seán Cannon, a long time friend, stepped in for Luke, when he couldn't be on stage. Seáns appearence wasn't that well received by the audiences at the beginning, but he has later turned out to be an important addition to The Dubliners, and their repertoir. In 1984, Luke Kelly died, but The Dubliners, now with Seán Cannon as a member, decided to keep on.

&gt; 1987 turned out to be one of the best - and busiest - years for the Dubliners. Their long time friend, and guest musician, Eamonn Campbell (29 November 1946 – 18 October 2017), brought the group together with the Pogues on the hit single the Irish Rover. This single took the Dubliners back to the charts, and also gave them a completely new audience; people who weren't even born when The Dubliners started off. And with Dublin celebrating its milennium in 1988, The Dubliners also received more attention than for years. Eamonn Campbell joined them on regular basis, a move which has turned out to be one of the most important in their history. In 1988 Ciarán Bourke died, after years of pain and difficulties. He always was, and still is very much remembered by The Dubliners, just like Luke Kelly is.

&gt; The eighties finished off with rumours that The Dubliners were to retire, probably something that's always been following the group. However, they didn't, and celebrated their 30th anniversary in 1992, with a double cd and extensive tour. The nineties have later brought a tour video from the German tour 1995, and the ""shock"" news that Ronnie Drew was leaving. He left in December 1995, after releasing a superb album, ""Dirty Rotten Shame"" a few months earlier.

&gt; Now, even the most optimistic Dubliners fans thought it was the end, but the remaindours decided to convince Paddy Reilly to join them, and they continued their busy touring and recording schedule. This move has also turned out to be excellent. Paddy, not very well known in Europe, had never been touring there, so he too enjoyed the experience, as well as being part of a band. He still, though, does tours in the USA in the winter and summermonths.

&gt; 2002, they temporarily reunited with Ronnie Drew and Jim McCann, for their 40th anniversary tour. They made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÉ 1.

&gt; After the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and, though he fully recovered, his voice was severely damaged, and he has not been able to sing since his illness

&gt; 
In 2005, Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and Patsy Watchorn joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with The Dublin City Ramblers; like Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the five-string banjo.

&gt; The band toured Europe every year. A planned tour of Denmark two weeks after the death of McKenna on 5 April 2012 went ahead as planned. From the first show in Copenhagen on 18 April onwards he was replaced by the Irish banjo player Gerry O'Connor. 

&gt; The band celebrated their 50th anniversary with an extensive year-long European tour and the release of a live DVD recorded live at Dublin's Vicar Street. 

&gt; In the fall of 2012 the band announced their retirement, effective after their 50th anniversary shows at the end of the year. The Dubliners played the final shows at Vicar Street in Dublin on 28/29/30 December 2012 the band were joined by former band member Jim McCann.

&gt; The band made their final TV appearence in the UK on the BBC's New Year's Eve edition of Jools Holland Annual Hootenanny' on 31 December. Their last public appearance as the Dubliners was on 27 January 2013 in memory of Barney McKenna. The remaining members Sean Cannon, Eamonn Campbell, Patsy Watchorn and Gerry O'Connor continue to tour Europe in 2013/14.  

&gt; People probably don't recognize what The Dubliners have meant to the world of music. By the way, not only the world of music, but the world as a whole. They have first of all paved the way for dozens of bands from Ireland and Scotland, like the Chieftains, the Pogues, U2, Ossian, the Fureys and so on. The number of artists that list The Dubliners as one of their major influences and idols, is endless. They have brought folk music to millions of people all over the world, people who never would have been interested at all. That isn't only because of the folk music, the instrumentals alone, it's because of The Dubliners, their astonishing voices, their undescribable instrumentals, the wild life style and drinking, late sessions, their enormous beards, their extensive touring, their charisma and characters. It was, and still is to a certain extent, a blend the world will never see again.

&gt; The Dubliners have brought Ireland to the world in a way that no emigration has, they have brought the world to Ireland, and they have brought people all over the world closer together. Whenever it ends, the world will never be the same again. Read more on Last.fm.

Testiclese,,,"Technology and, well, money, will eventually make national borders a relic of the past. It’s inevitable. We’ve been moving towards centralization since, well, forever. The US is more centralized than it was during the Civil War, the EU doesn’t even compare to Europe from 70 years ago. The UN, the WTO, all other trade treaties - all organizations meant to bring us closer together. 

The reason why there’s even any backlash - Trump and Brexit - is because it was happening *too* fast. They got too greedy. But they’ll be back after these temporary setbacks. 

I’m not even going to go into the usual “we are all one big human happy fucking family” that is meant to placate the plebs. The *real* reason is because Billionaire Jang, from Beijing, wants to buy property in Seattle and Billionaire Koch from the US wants to sell his shit in the EMEA and Billionaire Mohammed wants to buy Chelsea and shop in Monaco and they all want to cross borders and expand their wealth and move their money and sail on their yachts fly on their jets as unencumbered as possible.

The Internet changes the game as well. Information *can* now flow freely between borders, money and goods and people will inevitably follow.

Jaqqarhan,,,"&gt;However the non-white population has exploded since the 1950s, and is expected to balloon over the next 50 years

That's really just a return to normalcy though after the massive boom in the white population from 1800 to 1950. China and India almost always had much larger populations than all of the white people in the world combined. The rest of the world is just catching up to the massive white population boom. Every country goes through a population boom during their industrial revolution. Europe, North America, and Japan industrialized earlier than most other parts of the world, so they had their population boom early.

Whiteness is a pretty recent evolutionary adaptation that came after humans had already spread out around Africa, so white people never had a real chance to ever become a minority. It wouldn't make much sense to have a white majority because most of the world has climate where darker skin makes more sense.

&gt;Historically no nation with a white European ethnic majority has evolved to become a nonwhite-majority nation, and we are set to see that happen very soon. America is set to be a white minority country by 2050

That's bullshit though because it relies on a completely nonsensical definition of ""white"" where anyone with any Hispanic ancestry is considered non-White even if all their Hispanic ancestry comes from Spain. Spain is a white European country, so it's rather absurd that we call all those pale white Cuban immigrants of European ancestry non-white because they came from a Spanish speaking country. The whole minority majority idea also relies on the ""one drop rule"" where anyone with a bit of non-European ancestry is mixed race and therefor non-white. If you look at the genetic composition of Americans, the country will still have overwhelmingly European ancestry in 2050 and beyond. All the obviously white people with a quarter Asian or Mexican ancestry are part of the nonwhite majority.

&gt;That would probably be the first time an indigenous population has voluntarily become a minority in its historic homeland.'

The whole concept of an ""indigenous population"" is silly. British ancestry is a mix of many waves of immigrants over thousands of years like the Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Danes, Norse, Normans, etc. The fact that modern day immigrants do so peacefully instead of getting in to wars with the locals should be celebrated, not attacked.",True,0,1509516902,,1509517118,0,dp6gzbr,False,t3_79xwxx,t1_dp6dpwq,/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/79xwxx/international_nationalism/dp6gzbr/,1512007843,70.0,False,firstworldanarchists,t5_2sw5r,public,

Result: Loss

Streak: **3L**

This one stings a bit differently than other losses. This team was composed was winning at the break and looked the better side. They were at home had this game on lock down and they came out so flat. What hurts the most is it was a POD runner up originally and I originally typed ROMA DNB/+0 as POD, but as I was writing it I felt that Basel was better. Not to throw shade at anyone but once I saw it was a top post in soccerbetting i knew it was doomed. Then when someone who is subscribed to my message service messaged me ""good pick on Basel"" and a screen cap of the 2-0 win from their away match I was like ""Fuck me he has just done the jinx"" 

Moscow scored shortly after to make it 1-1. Then another subscriber said the parlay was looking good and that Basel winner would let him cash Roma ML. Moscow scored again off a horrific defensive error. 

Oh well. That's the game. Champions league record dips to 23-7-12 W-D-L 

We need to get back to winning ways. We're staying in Europe. Unfinished business to attend to. Let's fucking BANG some overs and we gotta get the POD dub in italy that we didn't with Inter and didn't with Roma cause I swapped it for Basel. Let. Us. Go. 

**Third Eye POD: Napoli v Manchester City O 3  (-117)**

Too much talent. Rested players. Both defenses broke in the first leg and it didn't pour over. All studs playing. Napoli has been banging em in at home. City doing it on all fronts. I think we will see an electric affair. Pep has praised this Napoli team as one of the best he's ever seen if not the best. They started slow in the 1H and controlled 2H. 

City have only conceded once in the tournament and it was to Napoli. I think we see both teams score and I think we will see another, but Im not sure if there will be a winner. could see a 2-2 affair. 

Thinking we see a boosted Napoli side at home and this City side is disciplined and great but aren't the best defensively. I like our chances here to get out the rut. 

**side plays**

**Tottenham v Real Madrid O 3 goals (-112)**

If Harry Kane wasn't such a doubt this would be the POD move. Madrid away from home has been better than at home. Less pressure and the historic Wembley arena will bring the best out of this Madrid side. The match was close last time, but this time I see Madrid bringing the fight to Tottenham. This one will be great. 

**Real Madrid ML (+122)**

Yes, please. It's a good price for a team that is still one of the best in world football in a game they will go balls to the walls for. 

**Porto v Leipzig O 2.5 (-111)** 

These teams been leaking in UCL and I think both will score and we will see a winner.

That said, I agree with you that at any point in the above comment it could be a civil war or not. That seems to be the entire point of Pat's writing. He's ambiguous to a fault. It's one of the things I love most about his writings. 

&gt;Explain to me how you can read *that* passage and not understand that the eight cities are on the same side? … In essence, it implies Selitos’ *could* have defended any of the cities, but since he was already with MT, the other seven cities had to look for another way. Not to defend themselves *against* Selitos, but in the *absence* of him.

Yes, even after this part. Again, the usage you've put forward is possible, but not the only possibility. Just because historical examples seem to be my theme today:

&gt;&gt;But the true cause of Germany's  succes was the Panzer 4. Using the power of this tank the Germans ravaged Europe.  [...] When America joined, lacking the Panzer’s power, they found their safety elsewhere. They put their trust in manufacturing, in cost efficiency. And so they put their trust in the M4Sherman.

Now, regardless of how accurate that is (WW2 tactics and weaponry isn't a historical topic I have much knowledge in) there's nothing incorrect about the use of language. You could reconstruct the sentence, using almost identical wording, to say the Germans attaching England had to put their trust in Planes instead of tanks and there would again be nothing wrong with the language. Again that's the beauty of this work, the ambiguity.

I agree wholeheartedly that it *could* mean that they're on the same side of the war. But I will argue all day that I believe it's going to turn out the other way.

The Ottomans got to Sinop first so he was in control, but they gave enough time for the Candarid army to walk over to siege down Trebizond, and the Ottoman army went to pursue them, making me in charge. Later, was able to bait the Ottomans into providing the numbers to siege down Sinop as well so I didn't have to go over force limit. Full-annexed Candar, claimed Constantinople, then released him again as a vassal. The same thing happened with Byzantium. Both the Ottomans and Venice declared on him, but the Ottomans left Constantinople to siege Serbia down (though this time I had to contribute the numbers) and Venice peaced out without taking any land, so I was able to full-annex Byzantium and move my capital to Constantinople after raising autonomy.

From here, my plan was to pull off a (slightly delayed) Negroponte island-trap on the Ottomans. Built up the heavies and galleys I needed, set Candar on scutage (so that I don't lose unnecessary warscore) and managed to ally the Mamluks by a hair's breadth. Finally, I declared when I was ready. The Ottomans were allied to Bohemia and Tunis, but Bohemia couldn't reach me because Hungary (under his rival Austria's PU) and rival Poland wouldn't give him access and he wouldn't go over diplo relations limit to march a huge round to get to me (this would come in handy later as well), and Tunis would take a while to mobilise. The main Ottoman army pursued me as I had hoped, and I was able to trap them without much difficulty. Once the 25k stack was stuck, I called in the Mamluks.

The hard part was actually after the trap, because my army was definitely going to get stackwiped (Ottomans had a 4 shock general and a tech advantage) so I had to rebuild my army from scratch, but the Ottomans still had about 6-8 regiments running around and they were extremely dangerous and already heading for southern Greece. I had to recruit all mercs because they were the fastest, and just in time too, the small stacks turned around at the last minute. Thankfully, Tunis was occupied with the Mamluks and didn't land their troops in Greece. Sieged down Selanik and Edirne, barely beating an attacking mini Ottoman stack in the process, and carpet sieged the rest of the Balkans. The Mamluks were pretty dumb, they went to siege down Içel and let Alexandra fall to the Tunisians. What pissed me off was that they had just defeated the Tunisian stack and were beginning to siege back Alexandria, and I was just about to white peace Tunis, that the Mamluks white peaced themselves. Those idiots, they could have ravaged all of Anatolia if they had just waited a little longer. Warscore dropped as a result, so I decided to cross the strait and siege down Aydin before ending the war and taking Selanik (maybe not the best idea, should have left a fort in the Balkans for more warscore for future wars) and Edirne, as I had already white peaced Bohemia at this point.

Now, I had the superior navy and control of the strait, but my economy was in tatters. Due to all the mercs I recruited (as well as Ottomans with their siege ability taking Constantinople in no time making my war exhaustion skyrocket and my trade income to shatter), I had over a thousand ducats of debt and even when I lowered maintenance on everything I was barely making half a ducat a month. This wasn't good, so I declared bankruptcy, knowing that the Ottoman truce lasted longer than that. I had to give independence to Candar, and cede Edirne to Venice when he inevitably declared, but it didn't spoil my plan that much because Venice and the Ottomans were rivals, so the latter couldn't access Edirne anyway. Unfortunately, bankruptcy set my legitimacy to 0 and civil war immediately started ticking up, and I had basically no way of averting it, so I had to let them win, which lost me the Komnenoi dynasty; this was the only regret of my run. After bankruptcy, things looked a lot more healthy, I was making over 3 ducats a month at zero maintenance (previously it was all going toward interest), and Muscovy flipped friendly so I allied him immediately.

Subsequent wars against the Ottomans were relatively easy, they couldn't get to me at all. Bohemia still couldn't get access, and Tunis was easy to defeat especially if they landed in mountain provinces like Epirus. Second war, took Thessaly, Skopje (released Bulgaria) and Kosovo to attack Serbia. Serbia was allied to Bosnia and the Ottomans warned me (this isn't fair, you shouldn't be able to warn people if you have a truce with them), so I focused down Bosnia, cancelling his alliance with Bohemia, then occupied everything and waited until I could cancel the Ottoman-Bohemian alliance as well because Bohemia no longer considered Poland as a rival, then full-annexed Serbia. Unfortunately, Bosnia allied Venice, so I turned on the Ottomans again instead, who allied France. Remember how I said that Bohemia wouldn't go over diplo relations limit to reach me? Same here, I never saw any French troops (he only had 8 transports, so I would have defeated any army that landed anyway). White peaced France and Tunis, then took Kastoria, Epirus and Zeta and returned Silistria and Burgas. Managed to ally Austria after the war, though Muscovy formed Russia and broke the alliance because he wanted my Crimean provinces. My ally Milan got declared on by Venice, which should have been an easy war, but Venice later called in the pope and Genoa so Milan was a goner. Thankfully, I sieged down Corfu, Dubrovnik and Dalmatia fast enough before they could turn their attention to me, and I was able to cancel the Venetian-Bosnian alliance and eat the latter up later.

Set Wallachian land as vital interest which Bulgaria claimed, then ate him up. Fourth Ottoman war, took Lezhë and returned the rest of the Bulgarian cores. Albania declared independence from Vlorë and I quickly ate him up. Finally, in 1569, I was able to call Austria and the Mamluks-aka-cannon-fodder in against the Ottomans to finally push into Anatolia. While the first half of the war was rather back-and-forth, with us taking forts then the Ottomans defeating our armies with his pocket Skanderbeg 5-5-1-1 king-general, we eventually managed to ravage Anatolia all the way to Mosul, especially when I managed to white peace the Ottoman allies Khorasan and Delhi. This marked the turning point in the campaign, after which I became a great power in my own right, and taking Hüdavendigar made my trade income soar. Not long after, Aragon who had taken quantity ideas fell into my PU, which France contested but it honestly wasn't a fight with Austria by my side. In no time, the Ottomans were partitioned between me, Tabarestan and the Mamluks. After I broke my alliance with them, the Mamluks proved to be a formidable enemy, somehow consistently producing 3-star generals with at least a 4 in both fire and shock. This game wasn't friendly to me on enemy generals at all.

In 1712, I got a lot more aggressive than I should have and completely kicked a greatly weakened France out of Europe in one war. Coalitions kept forming, but I learnt a pro tip from my Byzantium campaign: if you declare on an ally of a coalition member and set that coalition member as a co-belligerent, the entire coalition will be brought in but you can separate peace everyone. This method allowed me to fight coalitions and take way more than 100 warscore from them in the peace deal, kicking the more powerful members out first and gobbling as many remaining members as possible to reduce the strength of future coalitions. Obviously I had to abandon my steadfast ally Austria by doing this because it was a coalition of HRE princes, but I had to cut him down to size eventually. It also really helped that a massive Brandenburg fell into a PU under Russia, which took him out of the coalition. All it took was one big war, which my economy and manpower really suffered but I was able to eat about half of the HRE in one war by staggering the peace deals and coring time, though this is easier said than done, and I had to wait out call for peace for quite a while.

I know I didn't take the conventional route this run, and was a hair's breadth away from failing for almost a hundred years, but it's all the more rewarding because of that. Pulling off the Negroponte strategy as anyone other than Byzantium made me incredibly satisfied. However, this is not a route I would recommend at all, I feel it's too RNG based.

&gt;**Segundo Dara Khosrowshahi, futuro no País depende das decisões do governo, com o Senado brasileiro se preparando para votar a regulamentação dos aplicativos de transporte**  


&gt; O presidente executivo da Uber Technologies, Dara Khosrowshahi, disse nesta terça-feira, 31, que o futuro da empresa no Brasil depende das decisões do governo, com o Senado brasileiro se preparando para votar a regulamentação dos aplicativos de transporte. “Depende das decisões do governo”, disse Khosrowshahi a jornalistas quando perguntado se a Uber deixaria o Brasil caso o projeto de lei mais rígido seja aprovado. Conforme apurou a coluna de Sonia Racy, sensibilizados pela mobilização do Uber, senadores decidiram na reunião dos líderes nesta terça-feira, 31, que vão aprovar um destaque ao projeto que regulamenta aplicativos de carro particular. A mudança vai retirar a obrigatoriedade da placa vermelha e de o condutor ser proprietário do veículo. Um estudo do Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade) concluiu que a entrada do Uber e de outras empresas de aplicativos de celular no mercado de transporte individual de passageiros é, em sua maioria, benéfica para o consumidor por aumentar a concorrência e ainda possibilitar a redução de falhas de mercado. O texto com as considerações iniciais foi divulgado nesta terça-feira, 31, quando o Senado Federal deve analisar um projeto que regula os serviços de transporte particular por meio de aplicativos como Uber e Cabify. Os próximos passos do estudo poderão dar números precisos a respeito dessa tendência.

Wiki is a good place to start  
&gt;Mountain ash is a name used for several trees, none of immediate relation. It may refer to:  
Eucalyptus regnans from Australia, the tallest of all flowering plants  
Fraxinus texensis, from Texas  
Sorbus aucuparia, also known as rowan.  
Sorbus americana, from eastern North America  
In North America (mainly U.S.) trees in the subgenus Sorbus subgenus Sorbus are often styled as mountain-ashes to convey their unrelatedness to true ashes.  
In northwestern North America, Sorbus sitchensis is known as western mountain ash or Sitka mountain ash.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_ash  


So, which tree are we talking about? Given the New World origins of all but one of those trees, I think it's clear the rowan is the one.   

The rowan is a most interesting tree!
&gt;... Sorbus aucuparia fruits have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea, syrup, jelly or liqueur) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, fever, infections, colds, flu, rheumatism and gout.[46]...  
[49] The robust qualities of S. aucuparia make it a source for fruit in harsh mountain climate and Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Monarchy recommended the planting of the species in 1779.[30] ...    
The leaves were fermented with leaves of sweet gale and oak bark to create herb beer.[45] Fruit are eaten as a mash in small amounts against lack of appetite or an upset stomach and stimulate production of gastric acid.[44] In folk medicine they are used as a laxative, against rheumatism and kidney disease, and as a gargled juice against hoarseness.[24]  
Wood of S. aucuparia is used for cartwright's work, turner's work, and woodcarving.[2] Wood can be used from trees as young as 20 years.[37] The sapwood is golden and white, while the heart-wood is brown. In almost treeless regions it is used as firewood.[6] The leaves are sometimes used as fodder for livestock while the fruit are used against erysipeloid infections in domestic pigs and goats.[3] Bark of the plant was used to dye wool brown or red.[45] Honey from S. aucuparia flowers is strongly aromatic and has a reddish color.[59]  

But there's more
&gt;In the Prose Edda, the Norse god Thor saves himself from a rapid river created by the giantess Gjálp by grabbing hold of a rowan, which became known as ""Thor's protection"".[62]   
In English folklore, twigs of S. aucuparia were believed to ward off evil spirits[21] and witches.[63][64][65] The plant was called ""the witch"" in England and dowsing rods to find ores were made out of its wood.[45] Twigs of S. aucuparia were used to drive cattle to the pasture for the first time in spring to ensure their health and fertility.[66] The wooden shafts of forks and other farm implements were constructed from S. aucuparia, to protect farm animals and production from witches' spells.[63] In weather lore, a year with plentiful rowan fruit would have a good grain harvest but be followed by a severe winter.[21]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbus_aucuparia#Mythology_and_customs  

 And for a modern Halloween treat  
&gt;Within the mythology of MTV’s Teen Wolf, Mountain Ash is mainly used by Druids. It blocks and exhibits control over werewolves and other supernatural creatures.  
http://teenwolf.wikia.com/wiki/Mountain_Ash  

So at the end of the day, it looks as though Mountain Ash is simply an Americanism for rowan.  

Now the Ash tree, on the other hand, has a long history in Europe

TulasShorn,,,"&gt; I agree that the IQ numbers at the low end are probably confounded by malnutrition, but this thread didn't discuss genetic potential as far as I can tell, just actual IQ numbers however environmentally confounded, so I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with

I possibly misunderstood your position, but, to be fair, the way you have been posting sure makes it seem like you want to write off a decent chunk of the world's population as irredeemably stupid. Sure, the data is just saying what the IQ numbers are now, but that isn't very useful without considering how drastically those numbers could change with basic interventions. 

&gt; Dysgenic effects could also be fairly significant depending on the different rates of reproduction, and with respect to Bangladesh specifically there is a caste system that can maintain largely distinct but parallel genetic populations for potentially thousands of years, increasing the variance within the country and accounting for the outliers that you cited notwithstanding the dismal averages.

I really doubt that you could see these effects maintaining distinct populations for thousands of years, considering how chaotic history is. Furthermore, Bangladesh is 90% Muslim and does not have a caste system. If there was a rigid caste system at some period in the past, that would mean little room for assortive mating, so I wouldn't imagine that it would select very strongly for intelligence. Lastly, I'm not talking about Bangladeshis or Indians in the US, I have met plently of them from a wide variety of socioeconomic strata in their own countries. 

&gt;  The high end are all whites and East Asians ... two specific races that were successful at colonizing a huge swath of the world precisely because of their unique sophistication.

The reasons for European dominance in the 1700 and 1800s are hugely contentious, complicated, and difficult to determine. I would doubt that IQ is even a third order effect; luck, geography and culture seem more likely to me. It is not as if there have been no empires based built from other ethnic groups; if an alien had come to the planet in 1600, it would have thought that the three dominant cultures were the Ottomans, Mughals, and the Safavids, which are respectively, Turkish, Turko-mongol, and Persian. Various Chinese dynasties have been successfully run by Mongols and Manchus, which makes me think the Han genetics are not so important for the maintenance of the empire. (And I don't really think you can claim Mongols are ""East-Asians"" in the sense that you mean).

&gt; I think on some level you know it because you didn't actually contest the accuracy of what I said, you just huffed and gasped and insulted me a bunch of times.

I didn't bother to contest the accuracy of what you said because it is a terrible comparison. The picture is some peasants or refugees (I don't have any context for the picture), and you are comparing them to the Upper East Side?! Of _course_ the UES has a higher IQ, it is a highly self-selected location for political and financial elites within the US, with enormous barriers to entry. Even if I didn't believe in HBD at all, I would still believe that the UES has a uniquely high IQ, just due to believing IQ is a real thing. A better comparison would be between the picture and some rednecks (peasants) in Mississippi. Why didn't you make that comparison?

Anyhow, you are conflating two different things: silverware and etiquette. Eating a traditional Indian meal doesn't use silverware, but it sure as hell has etiquette. The two concepts are not in any way related. Sure, I can agree that in some broad sense, etiquette (i.e. unwritten rules) tracks class and therefore tracks intelligence. But silverware? Nah.

The type of silverware you use has much more to do with the style of cuisine (or the causality is the other way around, the type of silverware determines the style of cuisine), but either way the difference between leaving your steaks whole or cutting them into small pieces does not seem correlated with etiquette to me.

So I'd agree that in WW I Germany was definitely in bad papers without the USA's arrival, but the latter was a catalyst for rapid collapse which otherwise might've been avoided.

joycez123,,,"Having backpacked for about 3 months in Vietnam, China, and Korea last year I would definitely recommend backpack - but contrary what people might say about how long you're staying in each place, I would say the key to the suitcase v. backpack debate comes down to how you plan to travel between destinations.

In most of SEA you'll be taking buses, taxis, scootering, or walking most places, which makes it much more convenient to have a backpack. I would suggest to some people who go to Europe and plan on flying and/or taking trains that suitcases may be easier since backpacks are sometimes clunky and hard to carry through tightly-packed cities and narrow trains. Additionally, a backpack can do all the things a suitcase can do - with the exception of carrying as much stuff, but the same cannot be said of a suitcase (namely you can't take it hiking). 

I have an Osprey 80L Farpoint, and it's amazing, but it is definitely made for travel and not hiking purposes. I think it's a good balance between a suitcase and backpack since it functions like a backpack, but it's the biggest bag I have seen on the market, and it opens around the side (as opposed to the top), which makes it much easier to organize your clothes on longer trips. You can also check out the 70L Farpoint which is slightly smaller, but comes with a detachable daypack, which may be useful for your travels.

CoolathenU,,,"**tl;dr The role of ANZ during the Cold War was to stop the spread of communism throughout Asia, neither nation would've been very useful in an escalation of war due to the most likely outcome of escalation being nuclear and the fact that neither nation is nuclear capable.**

Australia and New Zealand weren't a part of NATO and signed their own independent treaty with America called the ANZUS treaty (Australia, New Zealand, United States), the treaty was a three way defensive pact between the nations that was signed in 1951. The treaty saw ANZ become involved in the Korean and Vietnam war. The idea behind ANZUS was to stop the spread of communism through Asia as America already had NATO for Europe, NATO dealt with problems in Europe, ANZUS dealt with problems in Asia. America were more concerned with the spread of Communism rather than an escalation of hostilities wasn't really considered or even worried about. In 1984 there was a disagreement between the US and New Zealand over the movement of nuclear carrying submarines docking in New Zealand and as a result New Zealand left the ANZUS treaty. As for what was expected of ANZ if the Cold War became hot, the outcome would most likely have been an all out nuclear war and the possible destruction of the world. Both NATO and the East Bloc knew that the only outcome of an escalation of hostilities would result in nuclear warfare rather than more traditional boots to ground warfare and Australia and New Zealands role in the Cold War was more to prevent the spread of communism in Asia rather than assist in a potential hot War as neither Australia nor New Zealand were or are nuclear capable.

Valtteri is considered to be one of the most exciting racers and young talents in Formula 1 and has recently renewed his Mercedes contract as Lewis Hamilton’s teammate, having previously raced for Williams. He has consistently been a high performer and is known for his ice cool composure, nimble driving style and ability to learn quickly which makes him stand out from his racing peers. Born in August 1989 in Nastola, Finland, he was entered for his very first kart race at the age of six and over the ensuing decade, the karting circuits of Finland and Europe would become his home from home. He won numerous races and Championships and was a member of the Finnish national karting squad for seven years In 2007, at the age of 17, he made the step up to single-seater racing. Valtteri made his Formula One debut at Albert Park, Melbourne, in the 2013 Australian Grand Prix, thereby becoming the ninth driver from Finland to compete at this level. His debut season turned out to be a difficult one – but he at least outscored his team-mate Pastor Maldonado by four points to one. The era of the Hybrid Power Units in Formula One began in 2014. After a change of engine supplier at Williams, Valtteri was back in a Mercedes-powered vehicle for the first time since his spell in Formula 3. He registered his best season so far in the highest echelon of the sport, making six podium appearances and scoring 186 championship points to finish the campaign in fourth position, behind the Silver Arrows duo of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg and three-time race winner Daniel Ricciardo. That year, Valtteri and his team-mate Felipe Massa secured third place for Williams in the Constructors’ Championship. His best results were two runner-up spots in the British and German Grands Prix. In the 2015 season, Valtteri once again outscored his team-mate Felipe Massa, despite missing out on the start of the season due to a back injury. He made two podium appearances and finished the year with 136 points. In the 2016 season, his fourth in Formula One, Valtteri secured his team’s sole podium finish, which came in the Canadian Grand Prix. He again came out on top in the internal contest against team-mate Felipe Massa by a score of 85 to 53 points. For the 2017 season, Valtteri signed to race for Mercedes, as teammate to Lewis Hamilton, replacing Nico Rosberg who retired after winning the 2016 Championship. This made him the 11th driver to compete in Formula One with the Silver Arrows, following in the footsteps of the great Juan Manuel Fangio, Sir Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. He stands currently 3rd in the World Drivers Championship after having won 2 races (Russia &amp; Austrian Grands Prix 2017) and received 10 podium places.

This is yet another in a series of incredibly high profile speakers the Guild has lined up - we have been working industriously behind the scenes and would recommend you watch this space! Following one of the biggest speakers in the last 15 years in the form of Kanye West, and other great guest speakers such as Stormzy, Woody Harrelson, Nobel Prize winning Professor Yunus, Lil Jon, Martin Garrix to name a few, the illustrious and award winning Oxford Guild Society, after a great deal of hard work and extensive negotiations, is excited to bring you another huge figure from and one of the biggest speakers of the year.

&gt;Sirer and others have emphasized that fostering cryptocurrencies could be a means for Russian officials to skirt sanctions. Russia faces US sanctions over the 2012 death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and the country’s intervention in Ukraine and occupation of Crimea. The Magnitsky sanctions froze all US assets of 18 Russian officials accused of human rights abuse; in 2016, it was expanded to include 44 other officials. The US coordinated with the European Union to sanction Russia for its actions in Ukraine in 2014, limiting Russia’s access to financing and the country’s access to using US and European technologies in its financial, energy, and defense sectors, including US-exclusive oil shale extracting technology. Digital currencies could allow Russian officials to electronically send and receive money out of the country and evade the sanctions.

wordsofivory,,,"The game suggests that socialism could create more problems than it fixes. That ideas like universal healthcare come with their own set of problems.

The idea is that, if taken to its extreme limits, universal health care could leave people worse off in the long with. For one, it would also create a much larger demand for medication than there is a supply of it. The huge financial burden could potentially cripple a country's economy by eating into other important resources. People would be left poor due to crippling taxes, lack of sustainable jobs, etc. 

We already see this in effect in Europe. An increasingly growing population of older people who can't work or provide necessary labour due to age, and are putting a huge financial and resource burden on the economy due to medical care. We literally don't have the staff or money to look after so many people.

Just to provide an example based on what I mentioned above, in recent months I have gone to my pharmacy to pick up heart medication (which I need to stay alive), and increasingly been told that they have a shortage of it. They literally can't make the medication fast enough. ""Generic"" medication has helped to alleviate the problem somewhat, but the longer people are able to live, the worse this problem is going to get.

It isn't just a fantastical idea. It's existing reality, right now.

Even if you don't agree 100% with those ideas, it still sounds like an interesting setting for a game, right? Nope, apparently it's a GamerGate wet dreams and that makes the developer scum as a result.

WetUSB,,,"Ignore the fact that European settlers came in a few centuries ago, destroyed their way of life, introduced disease, attempted genocide and basically marginalised them so badly that they found their culture and lifestyle so substandard that they were unable to attain basic achievements of other Australians, as they powered on ahead. 

It would be fairly easy to wipe the slate clean and pretend the last centuries of racism didn't happen wouldn't it? Pretend that as long as we don't do anything wrong now, racism didn't happen or doesn't happen. Turning a blind eye to the injustice that is happening to them in the present, which occurred as a result of past marginalisation, is being wilfully ignorant. This is why we need Indigenous programs that will help break the cycle that past Australians enforced on them. Indigenous programs ARE based on need - need that manifests from GENERATIONS of systematic racial discrimination. 

For example, for 3 generations, the Government imposed a 70% income tax based solely because off your race. This leads to your family being unable to afford the best education for their children in the first generation. In the second generation, they're unable to afford their housing. In the third generation, they've given up on working and rely on welfare. Their kids are thinking this is the normal way of life. Suddenly, the Government abolishes this 70% income tax. You say 'hey, we still need some help, even though we're on equal playing ground now. we have no education, no proper housing, no experience'. They proceed to respond: that would be racism cause we're favouring your race. Its insulting. And galling.

neofang101,,,"I'm not exactly what you are looking for with your specifications, and other people have posted but I will too. 

I started playing FFXI with a NA account but then moved to EU and stayed there since with a EU account, from around 2004 to around December of 2015, but very on and off. A few months a year, up to 9-10 months in a year. 

1- The game today while I haven't played in 2017, is obviously vastly different from before. I'll let the other guys answer, but my answer in short is that outside of end-game the social atmosphere for the majority of content is dead. Which is sad, but sort of understandable.

2- I started when I was in early teens. My first job was MNK. Now, it's a mix between a lot of different jobs, depending on the task at hand. I had multiple Lv.99 jobs; THF, WHM, NIN, SAM, SMN, BLU, DNC, BST, DRG, MNK. I really liked them all, but my favorites were WHM (always in demand and I did a great job at it), NIN (for solo), DNC (good at solo and movement spd+ dance), THF (for treasure hunter), SMN (walking around with summons)

3- I missed that when you met people that were Lv.40, 50+ they all knew how to play the game. They went and got their outpost warps, they knew how to get to kazham. They get their telepoints, they actually played the game. Today Lv.99 and these guys have played for like a week or less, they can barely sort out the controls.

Also zones outside of base town/end-game areas were not 99.99% empty. Today I imagine like 2015/2016~ it's still the same? 

4- Worst expansion, in my opinion was Wings of the Goddess. I tried to finish all of the missions but maybe it's just me, I just didn't like how they formatted them. I really enjoyed the missions and story in FFXI so I beat all of them; nation/ranked missions, Zilart, and all those other cool fancy ones. WoTG just didn't appeal to me and the zones were totally dead by the time I attempted to finish them. 

5- I played FFXIV:ARR. I played it for 2 weeks, and got NIN and DRG to around level 30-37 each, then I just quit. This is my experience up until that point: The social atmosphere did not exist. It's so much rush and spamming that you don't get the time and possibility to chat and say stupid/funny stuff with your friends that made the game such a great game, because of the social presence. Yeah you gotta concentrate but it was a chatroom-like feeling as well. People were so open and it was great, even though there was always drama too. Even I couldn't avoid total drama, tried to help a guy he thought I was trying to scam him? Over 1000 gil? WTF. Told him to buy a fishing rod so I could fish the quest monster for him, since he was on his way to me from the auction house. But whatever.
 
I didn't make much effort to actually look for people to talk to in FFXIV:ARR maybe that's my error, BUT it never came naturally. No one asked me to join their linkshell, no parties or people shouting for help/people they need to join their quest/mission. And in FFXI you had time to type and chat. In here you're constantly spamming ""weapon skills"", in reality it's auto-attack that you have to do yourself. FFXI's auto-attack is powerful and a liable source of damage. In FFXIV:ARR dungeons, you just rush, spam spam spam. There's no discussion on plans beforehand, no actual teamwork (I might as well be playing FFXII). In FFXI you had to plan, you had a specific job to do when you did a mission. I was just real disappointed with FFXIV:ARR overall. It was fun visually but after a while the lack of the social atmosphere is what killed it for me. Did some dungeons, it set me up with random people and you don't even talk. Might as well play a solo game. Not only that, armor is always ugly and silly looking even at level 30+. In FFXI I at least enjoyed wearing bone or beetle armor, then at 40 you have the royal knight set. Auction house is wonky, and not like FFXI's. I try not to rely on it being FFXI but a lot of it is just weird. No spike damage, in FFXI you saved up TP for a big 2k-3k damage where a normal attack would be 100-200 damage a hit. Samurai in FFXI was great, chain weapon skills bam bam bam 3k, 4k+ per WS + chainskill, icarus wing, 2 hour, etc. None of that sort of gameplay in FFXIV:ARR up where I was at, even if I didn't unlock Samurai. Maybe I'm too biased with FFXI but even if I didn't play FFXI, I probably still wouldn't like it.

6- I miss some stuff from the older days/75 era, already explained in 4. Overall hell no, because in EU zone NO one wants to party for EXP and it took over a year to get to Lv.75. Only played during the dead hours or when JP rush hour starts. The majority of Non-JP players are in the USA, not even including Canada, Mexico, and South America. European players were like maybe 5% of the players at best. Post-75, I got to 99 so much easier, and thanks to updates I was able to finally solo all those delicious missions I never could do before, too low LV, gear not good enough blah blah blah.

7- Not playing now, but if I had to guess based on my last experiences it's that the game is old. 98% of the content is pointless in terms of rewards. 99.99% of the times a zone is empty unless it's a person passing through or endgame zones/main towns. Social atmosphere is dead while leveling up/doing non end-game missions and quests, because you're most likely soloing them at Lv.99. 

8- Thoughts and additional info: I'd love a more modernized sequel or prequel maybe in like 5-10 or so years. Make it a solo game, like FFXII-style where the story characters talk but also so that we can play as multiple characters/races and switch around (unlike FFXV), but let you make a NPC partner buddy that you can control (as to give a character creation option too). Also let them be customizable like FFXI in terms of weapons/armor, but not I'm not hardcore so get rid of skill ups and the maniac hours it takes to skill up. Unfortunately, the closest we'll get is that FFXI mobile game that was announced but no news has been released. I know Japan is really in the mobile scene but not me, the controls suck and battery life suck oh and non-JP games on mobile suck.

I miss the game but at the same time I can't spend so many hours on it like I used to anymore. ",True,0,1509534942,,False,0,dp6n3v0,False,t3_79zbdb,t3_79zbdb,/r/ffxi/comments/79zbdb/ama_request_any_player_who_has_played_ffxi_from/dp6n3v0/,1512011419,1.0,False,ffxi,t5_2qn97,public,

Foreign invaders never take care of the dikes properly, they don't take it seriously, the Germans didn't and the French didn't either. (This is also one of the reasons why the ongoing EU integration worries me a bit. Dutchmen know how important the dikes are, and our politicians know they'll drown right along with the rest of us if they embezzle the maintenance funds. An EU Ministry of Infrastructure won't.) Then there's the actual war damage. 

Of course, the immediate post-war government isn't free of blame either, those bastards spent most of the Marshall Plan money failing to reconquer Indonesia.

UltimateMong,,,"&gt; Finally respecting a culture that was already thousands of years old when Europeans were first leaving their caves is progress.

An in those thousands of years the Aborigines basically invented nothing compared to the progress of the rest of the world. Africans back then were making way better stuff than them.

I'm not saying they're useless but back in the old days when people would sail the seas and invade other people's territory it was up to the inhabitants to defend their territory and the Aborigines did a shit job at it. At least the Maoris put up a good fight and there wasn't even as many as the Aborigines.

And who killed Captain Cook? An even smaller group of inhabitants.

That was the way it was back then. They were lucky they weren't wiped out completely and no-one in this day and age should be apologising for something that had nothing to do with them when the times have changed just because they are the same skin colour.

Keep in mind that before 1918 Poland was under occupation. When Poland regained independence, the state was too busy with internal problems to think seriously about establishing colonies -- how can you even think about that without large fleet and the only sea port in Danzig, which was politically independent city, not under Polish control? (Port in Gdynia was build later). Many Polish citizens and people *wanted* to have colonies and join the prestgious circle of wealthy colonial powers, but it was about plans and aspirations olny.

N0handles,,,"While most people laughed at the ""pickle rick"" scene in Season 3 of the Rick and Morty TV series, few people actually understood it. Me, on the other hand, with my 200 IQ (that's right, my IQ is 200), am fully equipped with the mental tools needed to dissect the ""pickle rick"" scene in time to chuckle whilst watching it occur. No, I did not have to pick apart and analyze the scene, watching it over and over again, to understand the scene's true meaning. In fact, I knew Rick would be in pickle form immediately when Morty walked into the garage. BAM! Just like that, my brain calculated why the scene was funny and the true joke that was intended. Most people know very little about history, it's unfortunate, but that's just how it is nowadays. What, with the education system being so bad. Ahahaha. Dummies.  No offense, you guys are just retarded. I mean, it's not like I'm trying to insult you, but you were just raised this way. Raised to be inferior to me. Do not fret, I hold you in ABSOLUTELY no contempt. Let's get back to the meat of the argument. So, history lesson, there was once a philosopher called Aristotle. He was like Plato, but more practical. Oh, and Plato, he was a philosopher too. Philosophers are people who think about the world. Do you know what that means? To think about the world? I wonder if you can. I truly do, do not worry pleb, this is mere constructive criticism, it is not intended as an insult towards you.  You being inferior is OKAY, it is okay that you are inferior, not everyone can be as intelligent as me. Aside from my education (I'm a Harvard graduate, FYI), I was born with a 200 IQ. I wonder if you can even remember having read that I was born with a 200 IQ or if it's already exited your little brain. ANYWAYS, so, now we have established the concept of philosophers in your little pea brain. Philosophers = people who think about things. So, Plato, Aristotle. Both philosophers from the Roman Empire. Let's move forward in time a bit, yes, yes, let's move ALL THE WAY INTO THE 19th/20th century! So here we are. There's a hip new philosopher whose name is Nietzsche. So, if you've ever read Nietzsche you'll know he's a nihilist. Nihilism means ""the world has no purpose"", essentially. Nietzsche believed the world had no purpose. I have studied him for 10 years now at Princeton, it's such a nice school! I've had sex with tons of women during my stay there, women at places like that are attracted to big brain guys like me. It's just how it is, sorry chap. SO nihilism = no meaning in the world. This was groundbreaking for the time, prior to this, religion had ruled over the world. Christianity had dominated Europe, and everyone was obsessed with ""meaning"", ba! ""meaning"", what is that!? Hahahahaha, what a absolutely bizarre concept. Unfortunately, before Nietzsche could finish his philosophy he died of an STD, how dreadful! This was one of the single most troublesome things I had ever discovered in my life, second only to the fact that there are others out there with 201 IQs. Probably lying, probably cheated on their tests. Do you remember that we were talking about Rick and Morty pleb? Well, anyways, the ""pickle rick"" scene is what I consider to be the culmination of Nietzsche's work. I laughed, I laughed so hard at that scene because I was so happy, and I laughed because I realized how pointless the culmination of Nietzsche's work was anyways. Why had that concerned me so? Why had I cared so much about Nietzsche's work? The world truly has no meaning, few can actually come to this realization, but I did. If you had an IQ of 200, maybe you would too!

This distance is controlled by the devs. If they don't want you to render objects further than 50 yards away then there's nothing you can do about it. 

Obviously the shorter draw distance is exarcerbated when you're on a 280% flying bombing mission, making it feel like objects are rendered after you have passed the area.

Berlin (, German: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn] ( listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its 16 constituent states. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.

They have been made slaves, ‘sub-humans,’ property, etc. and their refusal to be this is who they are.  Sartre is saying that *formally* speaking we are all like this, but for many of us this frame goes unnoticed or else is experienced with less extremity.

There are no military exercises in Serbia that Russia was involved it, Serbia on the other hand participated in some Russian ones, which isn't unusual.  

&gt;does not openly condemn Russia either, they purposely avoid expressing a clear view on the issue

 Serbia - On November 5th, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement that it was ""it once again wishes to reiterate that Serbia supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.""[118] The statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that Serbia also supports the continuation of the peace process, with firm belief that only dialogue can lead to a solution in accordance with international law and with the respect for the UN Charter.

It does not condemn Russia, because it does not have the EU behind it like other European states do.  

&gt;As for being ''very nationalistic, and very Russophobic'' - well ain't that ironic coming from a Serb?? Unlike for example your country, nobudy in post 1991 Latvia has ever been a victim of race or nationality discrimination.

klawpsey,,,"I don't think it's fair to say these stylistic choices are 'gimmicks'. They're experiments, and are usually stylistically relevant to the subject matter he's dealing with. 

For example, the animation in Waking Life fitted in with its exploration of dreaming and of the porousness of the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness. Fair enough if you found the movie tedious, but I don't think the visuals were simply a gimmick. 

Similarly, we can debate the merits of Boyhood (I'm not a huge fan of it), but the filming over a long period of time was intrinsic to what the movie was trying to do. It wouldn't have had the same emotional resonance if they'd just recast the kid and aged the family with makeup. (Same applies to the 'Before' trilogy, and to its immersive long shots, which take you into a short, intimate encounter.)

As for the pretentious dialogue - I certainly sympathise with your viewpoint, and it can be grating. OTOH, in certain of Linklater's movies this sort of sophomoric philosophising fits with the characters he's depicting. High-school students (in the 70s, no less!), students travelling across Europe (in the Before trilogy). Compare, say, 'Bernie', which isn't about those sorts of people at all, and doesn't (afairemember) have that sort of dialogue in it, either.

Just to take a few points, over a million people died during the Iran Iraq war - a war between two competing brands of Islam. I haven't got the numbers but many died during the dismemberment of Yugoslavia. Neither was fermented by outside large powers but were the result of religious and ethnic tensions in relatively small areas. 
To say that the rise of the Internet has made people worldwide more aware of their shared humanity is undoubtedly true but it has also made people in third world countries aware of the wealth of the west hence the vast increase in migration that is leading to growing tensions in Europe in particular. Unfortunately I do not share your belief that diversity within a country is likely to kindle understanding and acceptance as all the historic - and also quite recent evidence such as the examples above is against you. A current example unfortunately close to me is Northern Ireland where the differences between Catholics and Protestants are tiny in ethnic or racial terms yet the tension continues and the vast majority of people voluntarily segregate themselves into predominantly Catholic or Protestant areas or British or Irish ethnicity areas (take your pick) I don't like it but these are the facts and must be faced before trying to find ways of sorting the problem out.

The Iran nuclear deal framework was a preliminary framework agreement reached in 2015 between the Islamic Republic of Iran and a group of world powers: the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China—plus Germany) and the European Union.

Negotiations for a framework deal over the nuclear program of Iran took place between the foreign ministers of the countries at a series of meetings held from 26 March to 2 April 2015 in Lausanne, Switzerland. On 2 April the talks came to a conclusion and a press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight parties had reached an agreement on a framework deal. The parties announced, ""Today, we have taken a decisive step: we have reached solutions on key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,"" which they intended to complete by 30 June.

smokeyzulu,,,"Y'know what's funny? When I see someone say something along these lines my gut instinct is to smirk. Then I remember that before I went to study in Serbia, I would have been just as clueless as the average urban Anglo-Western person.

Growing up in South Africa, I never really thought about food in terms of storage. So long as you have water, you can grow basically whatever you want, whenever you want. Screw seasons, that's for Europe.

When I went to Belgrade, I was surprised by the amount of time people spend prepping for winter, most notably my grandmother. 

Now I went there around the turn of the millenium (2002 to be exact) and stores were full, but people were still used to making their own stuff (it's a point of pride nowadays, when there is literally no reason to do it yourself and you'll always hear someone say ""wait til you try my ajvar/pinjur"" etc).

So around August/September people would be busy pickling their favorite vegetables (onions, carrots, beets, cucumbers) because it's tough to grow that stuff in winter. People were making their own tomato ""sauce"" I guess you'd call it (more like tomato puree you get in those tetrapak boxes) that would last throughout the winter. Put it in glass, in the cellar where it's generally cold and it'll last almost through to spring if you made enough and were careful enough with your planning.

Savory preserves like Ajvar (eggplant and pepper) or Pinjur (tomato and pepper), made without sugar mind you, are still a staple of winter tables and are frequently referred to as ""salads"".

So to get to the real point... which is fruit. The same applies there. Jams, preserves and drying. Raisins and prunes are the most well known, but here in South Africa guava rolls are pretty popular, as well as pear and apricot. You dry them properly, and they will last forever and a day.

Then you have fermentation. Sauerkraut is widely popular and piss easy to make. It's basically cabbage+salt+water+time (and a big rock to keep the cabbage under the water). 

Oh, and to put this all in perspective, my grandmother did all this, by herself, every year, while living in the capital city, in a densely populated neighbourhood. So did most of her friends, so did most of the people there (at the time).

tl;dr - We have been preserving food for a long time, most of the good stuff doesn't grow in winter so do a bit research and you'll probably be amazed at what you can do.",True,0,1509541944,,False,0,dp6r06r,False,t3_79zswb,t1_dp62vfr,/r/preppers/comments/79zswb/easy_to_grow_and_maintain_sources_of_food_in_a/dp6r06r/,1512013674,1.0,False,preppers,t5_2riow,public,

lelarentaka,,,"&gt;every country defines urban differently

Of course. But how do you think that would affect my argument?

&gt; you will find that the US is much less densely populated than Germany and most of Western Europe.

Again with this argument. In the topic of this thread, the factor that we are interested in is the [[Mean distance between people and hospital]]. But this measure is a bit circular, because a full-sized full-equipped hospital needs some number of people to be profitable, so really what we're measuring is [[Mean distance between people to people]] (abrevv. MDBPtP). This is a different metric from the simple population density that you're thinking off, which is simply [[population / land area]].

Just to give an example, countries like Egypt, Libya and Algeria has a low [[population density]], but they have very high MDBPtP because 99% all of their people are on the coast of the Mediterranean and the Nile. [See the data here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country)

Urbanization is a convenient proxy of MDBPtP, because the data is more widely available. When we're trying to make assessments about penetration of government services for example, MDBPtP is far more meaningful than simple population density.

Today at 19:00 is going to happen [the quarterfinal match](https://csgobets.com/match/90383/Natus-Vincere-vs-Space-Soldiers-WCA-2017-Europe-Main-Qualifier) of *WCA 2017 Europe Main Qualifier tournament* among **Natus Vincere and Space Soldiers**. Format of the meeting is Bo3. Squads will compete for reaching the semifinals of the championship with the main prize of $43,915. Participation confirmed by 20 e-sports teams. Squads are divided into groups A, B, C, D. Natus Vincere are at the playoff stage replacing Team EnVyUs. Space Soldiers reached the quarterfinals taking first place in Group C.

Squads met only once on July 5th within ESL One Cologne 2017 tournament, and victory on the Train map went to the Na'Vi team with a score of 16-9. In last five matches, [Natus Vincere](https://csgobets.com/team/Natus%20Vincere) scored two wins. [Space Soldiers](https://csgobets.com/team/Space%20Soldiers) today are in excellent gaming form, winning all five previous fights. Betting odds: Space Soldiers 2.02, Natus Vincere 1.69. Bookmakers prefer Natus Vincere, but in my opinion, the Turks are able to beat their opponents. 

**My prediction** for [the quarterfinal](https://csgobets.com/match/90383/Natus-Vincere-vs-Space-Soldiers-WCA-2017-Europe-Main-Qualifier) is **Space Soldiers winners** with a score of 2-1.

Realistically, 1 in 10 accounts is a smurf, that would mean circa 230,000 unique players have played at least one game of PvP.

For PVP:

At high silver/mid gold, the average queue time is circa 1-1.5 mins on EU servers (about 45% of player base is on EU server).

At mmr cap, anything from 5 - 15 mins. Usually around 8 mins at peak times.

If we assume an average of 4 hours of peak game time and an average of 2 min wait time for all players, that would suggest approximately 250 active players in the top 2000, and around 17,250 players in the remaining EU playerbase.

Obviously, EU peak time is different to US peak time, hence you could expect comparable numbers for each peak time.

Best estimates would suggest the player base during peak times would be around 17,500 on EU servers and likewise on the US servers.

* I need a horsehair brush. Any tips/pointers/advice on getting one? Does it really matter?

* I plan on getting some lexol leather cleaner, some saphir renovateur and then I'm in the market for some polishes that fit my shoes. Haven't seen any brands that this sub seems to favour, did i miss them?

Lord_Treasurer,mod-red blue image image-tory,Red Tory,"&gt;British judges could find themselves drawn into policy matters normally best left to parliament if a government bill on exiting the European Union is enacted as currently worded, a senior judge said on Wednesday.
&gt;
The EU Withdrawal Bill aims to provide legal clarity by converting existing EU laws into domestic ones while ensuring that Britain is no longer subject to EU court decisions after leaving the bloc in March 2019.
&gt;
One of the bill’s clauses says a UK court will no longer need to take into account anything done on or after exit day by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or any other EU entity, but “may do so if it considers it appropriate to do so”.
&gt;
David Neuberger, who recently retired as president of the UK Supreme Court, told a parliamentary committee that the clause could lead to situations where judges had to take into account economic or political factors when making their decisions.
&gt;
“These are the sort of factors which judges are not naturally the people to take into account. It puts them very much into policy areas where on the whole the tradition in the country has been to keep them out,” he said.
&gt;
Neuberger gave a hypothetical example, envisaging a situation where the ECJ had decided a point on a directive or regulation which affected the right to trade between EU member states, and a UK court found itself having to decide a similar point.
&gt;
“Should the UK courts take into account the fact that if they decided differently from the EU court it would affect trade between the UK and the EU, or possibly financial arrangements or City interests, or that it may affect political interests or international relations between the UK and EU?” he asked.

It's usually very obvious if someone is asleep in the left lane. But european countries enforce it with a time rule. In Germany, you have 45 seconds after passing to get your butt back into the right lane. Which is more than enough, but you know germans... they like to have standard for everything.

If you can't find an opening, and you are not willing to drive faster to continue passing, then you have to slow down and fall back in at the next opening. Simply driving the same speed as the car in the right lane and saying ""I can't go faster because of the speed limit"" is not a fair excuse.

Cash grab? Hardly ... it is a safety issue. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a law that goes along with this one that forbids passing on the right side - as that is the most dangerous maneuver you can do on a highway. Also gets you a huge fine in most european countries.

HarukiMurakarma,,,"I'll be honest I'm a bit tired from replying to these replies to my initial comment because I feel like people are talking past each other. No one is saying we should devote no police resources or public outreach programmes towards fighting terrorism. 

The point here is very simple. We should fight terrorism. We should also fight terrorism while taking into account the role that Islamic fundamentalism plays in some of the terror attacks around the world. What we shouldn't do is to discriminate against muslim people living here by assuming that they all have some terroristic tendencies, because 1. it's not fair to them since the vast vast vast majority of them will never ever consider committing any acts of terror 2. it alienates the muslim community which has done a lot to help fight extremism here already and makes it harder to fight terrorism in the long term. 

By discrimination I mean things like:

1. Choosing not to befriend a muslim person because of his or her religion;
2. Choosing not to hire a muslim person because of his or her religion;
3. Assuming that any individual muslim person that you encounter is more likely to be violent just because he or she is a muslim;
4. Assuming that any individual muslim person you encounter is a terrorist without any good reasons;
5. Making uncalled for comments and spreading inaccurate information about Islam without a good understanding of how Islam is actually practised by Muslim Singaporeans.

To respond to your comment specifically, I'm assuming that you believe that European countries should shut down Muslim immigration into their countries? But I'm sure you are also aware that almost all muslims living in Singapore are born and bred Singaporeans, whose ancestors have been living on this land for generations. Unlike European countries, Singapore takes in very few muslim immigrants and zero refugees, especially not from the middle east. The fear of accidentally ""importing"" foreign terrorists from the middle east via immigration into our country really shouldn't play a very big role in our understanding of the terrorist threats here. 15% of this country is already Muslim without much immigration. Unless you're advocating genocide or mass exile (which I know you're not), Islam is here to stay as part of the rich social fabric of Singapore. Exclusion of Islam is just not a viable option here; the only way forward is by working with the muslim community to push back against religious fundamentalism, and to devote more police resources towards fighting terrorists.",True,0,1509546114,,1509547378,0,dp6u9k5,False,t3_79z6mm,t1_dp6rs13,/r/singapore/comments/79z6mm/young_must_realise_risks_of_islamophobia/dp6u9k5/,1512015531,-3.0,False,singapore,t5_2qh8c,public,

BrewtalDoom,,,"*I do understand that there are stories within the story which have come out.  The human-interest stuff, if you will.  I don't see why we should ignore Campos' testimony though.

*The multiple shooters thing is interesting.  I have seen some of those Facebook posts and things were people have said there were multiple shooters but they themselves are very inconsistent.  There are stories of bullets being fired from outside the show, into the show from multiple angles.  There are stories of multiple gunmen running around the crowd shooting people.  There are a few different variations of the multiple-gunmen thing, which inclines me to think that perhaps it's people panicking in an unimaginable, chaotic situation and being mistaken.  I think there are also plenty of people simply making shit up for attention.  But one of the things I have to ask about the multiple gunmen thing is.... why?  And why not just have more than one patsy?  The Washington Sniper thing was more than one person.  These terrorist attacks in Europe are more than one person too.  I don't see the logic in having multiple gunmen who then all vanish without a trace.

*The photo is of his dead body, man.  You can see his face.

*The timeline hasn't been sorted out, for sure.  But I'm not sure how suspicious that is right now.  The hotel provided times which proved to have been wrong due to the forms being filled in after the fact and the simple fact that people don't know exactly what time it is all the time!  As for Campos, I believe there is audio of him saying 'shots fired' and giving the floor and room number, and he has said that he then called the police to give them details of the shooting etc.  He didn't 'flee' anywhere though.  That's loaded language.  Did he have family down there?  Does anybody know why he went?  Does it even matter?  He's not a suspect, he's a victim and I'm pretty sure freedom of movement is covered in the US Constitution. 

I'm not surprised that someone who managed to evade the police with their child-porn was found out after his brother went on a killing spree.  You're in the spotlight when that kind of thing happens.  It's basically, ""The police didn't find anything until they looked"".

The 27 year-old girl who died had suffered from seziures and had suffered several before dying, not long after an extremely traumatic and stressful event.  No evidence of foul play even hinted at anywhere.  Just a coincidence.  Who else are you referring to?  I remember some people died in a car crash, but that's easily within statistical norms.

It does seem like a ""1 dude bought 50 guns and kills 60 people"" to me because none of these theories seem to contradict that in any way.  Confusion over the exact timings of events during something chaotic like that does not say anything about whether Stephen Paddock was in that hotel room shooting into the crowd.  

It's good to ask questions though, man and not make outlandish claims.  I just don't see a reason for it to be fishy.  I really don't see how or why this could be a government-run operation.

Jooana,,,"&gt; I know but you need more boundaries than that, something that extent to cult (like the WBC) or nazis.

Why? You haven't explained yet why, except you believe you should have the right to control others' people speech as long as you disagree with it enough. 

&gt;
The problem is that you don't really believe that work like that in reality. Try to convince some scientology members that his religion is bullshit, sure it's easily proven that it is but you won't succeed. You know the problem when you claim that climate change isn't real, some people believe it because it's easier, no matter that 99% of the scientists think otherwise and most of people are really certain about the arguments for the reality of climate change. Anyway, better speech doesn't work in post-truth era like we are now. Better speechs are just not listened. Climate change deniers, anti-vaxx and other stupid people are not that big a deal normally (if people who have the power like the US president doesn't believe that, which is not the case right now)

People like you are far more dangerous than scientologists or anti-vaxxers will ever be. You're an unhinged fanatic, even if you have no conscience of it. And the fact you want to ban speech because you don't trust the ability of good speech to counter bad speech only reveals how you believe to be yourself vulnerable to those ideas. 

At the end of the day, Nazis rose in a society with the most advanced hate laws in existence. Just like communism rose in Germany, then Russia. The US, with the 1st Amendment, never had any problem with totalitarianism and never will - because bad ideas become more attractive when people don't have faith they can be fought with speech and start trying to put them down with laws. Dangerous people like you.

&gt;Far-right conspiracies work on some people and when you convince people that ""liberals"" are subhuman and deserved to die, you can't protect yourself behind the 1st amendment when one of your follower actually killed one. You have blood on your hand too. Should we agree on that ? Should we punish him for his sort of speech or can the speaker continue to spit his hate ?

Funny how obsessed you are with the far-right and how anti-American you are. Are you a far-left extremist? Normally only far-left and far-right types have such an unbalanced partisan view.

Also, I've already referred to you to the answer to your questions:
&gt;Check Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire and Brandenburg v. Ohio, for example. Or look up ""fighting words"".

 You said ""I know"". Turns out you don't? If you do know, why are you asking that? 

&gt;I think it applies in my example. If unresponsible freedom of speech kills, that's a pretty big interference on the freedom of the victim.

Let me guess: you get to decide what is ""unresponsible freedom fo speech"". If you agree with that particular speech, then it becomes censorship. 

&gt;close
&gt;Trump doesn't just want to deport them, he wants to build a huge wall too and what about the ""muslim ban"" ?

Pew Center numbers are just another estimate and they're one of the lowest one. So between 11 million and 13 million.

Also, it's November 2017 and you're still saying ""Muslim ban""? It's a temporary visa restriction on a few countries - including some like Venezuela and North Korea, while the vast majority of Muslim countries are left out. It's not a ban, just means getting a Visa is more complicated. And it's temporary. And it applies to everyone in those countries regardless of religion. And not all of those countries are Muslim as I explained. And yet you call it a ""Muslim ban""? What were you saying about ""conspiracies working on some people""? Perhaps you fell prey to one?

&gt;I don't think we're more restrictive on immigration but that's an other topic and that doesn't really matter, my point was just we don't kill people trying to cross our borders.

Again, there are million of illegal immigrants that Trump wants to legalize. In Europe, not even the most pro-immigration governments are proposing such a thing. The truth is that Trump is even to the right of the Sweddish green on immigration issues. It's just Europeans appropriate the rhetoric of the American left without even realizing that the American right is way to the left of the European left. 

Immigration in America is just on a different Overton window compared to Europe. It's a bit like guns.

This is fucking insane and is *dripping* in adolescent 2020 hindsight - I can't believe someone would make this argument with a straight face.  

You *might* be able to argue the path in WW2 &amp; 9/11 was somewhat clear (we were likely going to war), but nobody cares about that - its the **outcome** that matters.  At the time, there was a very real and honest belief that America was going to lose WW2 (we had no military post WW1 and there were **serious** questions about a 2 front war) or at least find itself in a world where the Nazis dominated Europe, the Japanese dominated Asia and the US slowly drowned in the middle.  That's fucking terrifying - imagine being 25yrs old in that world.

Making this same argument about the Great Depression is next-level silly.  The Great Depression was as bad as it was precisely because it was entirely unprecedented and those in power had no idea how to handle it.  The former Fed chair, Ben Bernanke, has actually written quite a bit about the great depression and how close we were to seeing the end of 'The Great American Experiment.'  

I'm convinced that part of the reason millennials are so malaised today is the utter and total lack of historical perspective.

Arderis1,,Cats &gt; Kids,"33 probably feels a lot older than it really is when you're raising 5 kids, but 33 isn't old by any means.  You have a lot of life ahead of you!  You deserve to be a real person, with real interests, with real passions.  Your husband should want that for you, also.  There is already a lot of advice here, but I'm going to throw my stories and suggestions at you.

- Get some contraception.  Not going to beat a dead horse about it.

- You haven't said your children's ages, but I assume at least the oldest 1 or 2 are school-age or Pre-K age.  I hope they're going to school, and that you aren't home-schooling.  I'm a former teacher with....strong feelings....about religious home-schooling.  Soon, all of them will be in school and that will free up some time.

- Being ""financially capable"": visit other subs for money saving (and time saving!) ideas: Frugal, EatCheapAndHealthy, MealPrepSunday are good starts.  

- Being ""physically capable"": You don't need a gym to get in shape.  Even 5-10 minutes a day will start to build some strength.  Do some lunges or squats with a baby in hand, do push-ups against a kitchen counter while the sink fills with dishwater, etc.  There are lots of ideas around the internet for stuff like this.  

- Time:  This is a losing battle for all of us, but probably sucks worse for you.  Organize life and make routines for as much as possible.  Get your kids to help you (if they're 2+ years old) with what they can, and get them to help younger kids if they're up to it. They can help with house chores also, https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/age-appropriate-chores-for-children-and-why-theyre-not-doing-them/ has a good list with some commentary.  Honestly, the kids and your husband should be participants in house upkeep and chores.  They live there too, and you aren't their servant.

- **The clarinet**: This one is huge for me, because I'm clarinetist.  For your sanity, *make time to play*.  Get thee to a community orchestra!  I met a lady at the Army School of Music this fall who is a SAHM of 4, Mormon, who home-schools.  She's a National Guard musician (like me) from a different state.  She finds time to practice, and she plays better than I do.  She's amazing.  If she can, you can.  DO IT.

- One last thought: My grandmother had her 3 kids pretty young also, and was unfortunately widowed around the age of 50.  She retired from teaching at about age 60, and has spent the last 27 years doing *whatever she wants.* She's been to Russia, China, most of Europe, and all over the US.  Careful investing and money management through her 20s to 50s made this possible, and you can do it too.  Start now.

rezb1t,072,NNID: rezb1t,"If you're just looking for some fun, sure! It's great fun for a couple of hours here and there. I don't think it's a very good sequel from a competitive perspective, though.

The new matchmaking completely ruins any chance of high level matches occuring because of regional matchmaking. There isn't enough good NA/EU players playing at the same time to get truly great lobbies. On top of that, the ranked system is so generous that most the people in S+ now were S in Splatoon 1. And S+ in Splatoon 1 was too easy for my liking.

The balance itself is stated by a few to be better than Splatoon 1, but that's just wishful thinking IMO. At a high level it's mostly the same idea as before, lots of overaggressive comps focusing on mobility above all, even if specifics about it have changed.

The motion controls frankly suck compared to Splatoon 1. Might be reasonable if you just play short-mid range, but for chargers against opponents with solid movement, it is hell.

This is all my opinion, and many disagree with me and that's ok. I do want to point out that I'm not some noob, I've been involved in comp Splatoon 1 since very near the beginning. But there are comp players with lots of experience who probably disagree with me as well.

Still though. I think it's worth 60$. The real question is if you'd enjoy any of the other cool games on the Switch.

GBJI,,,"&gt; Près de la ville de Gaspé, au sommet d’une falaise en forte pente, se dresse le plus haut phare du Canada. Il est bâti selon le modèle de la « tour impériale », mesure 34 mètres de haut et a été construit au milieu du XIXe siècle. Depuis que les navires commerciaux ont commencé à fonctionner par géo-référencement pour se guider, le phare du Cap-des-Rosiers est devenu obsolète. Comme tous les phares du Canada, il a d’ailleurs été mis en vente en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des phares patrimoniaux (S-215). Sauf que, contrairement à d’autres phares québécois et canadiens, celui de Cap-des-Rosiers n’a pas trouvé preneur, entre autres à cause des travaux au coût exorbitant que sa structure, qui compte des éléments de marbre, nécessite. Son avenir est donc menacé.
 
&gt; C’est le genre de cas qui pourrait faire l’objet de discussions au Sommet national du patrimoine bâti du Québec, qui se déroule ce mercredi à Montréal. Du côté des phares, l’enjeu de protection du patrimoine est récent puisque, jusqu’en 2015, c’était Pêches et Océans Canada qui en assumait la gestion. « Nous travaillons tous à mettre en valeur le patrimoine à travers nos champs d’expertise, mais dans la plupart de nos organismes, les moyens sont limités et nos actions s’appuient uniquement sur nos bénévoles », explique Lise Cyr, ethnologue et muséologue, qui représente la Corporation des gestionnaires de phares du Québec au Sommet.

(...)

&gt; « Évidemment, plus un phare est vieux et historique, plus il demande des soins dispendieux. C’est justement la raison non avouée de cette loi (S-215) qui permet au gouvernement de se débarrasser de ses obligations et de dépenses inhérentes à l’entretien de ces vrais phares historiques », écrivent Lise Cyr et Jean Cloutier, un expert des phares au Québec.
 
&gt; Ces phares étaient également équipés de repères sonores, dont la forme a varié avec les années. « C’était des complexes technologiques », raconte Mme Cyr. À une certaine époque, on tirait du canon à blanc. Il y a eu aussi des canons à brume, des cartouches explosives de coton-poudre, des cornes de brume et des poudrières.

People from Miami, Florida, and people from Smalltown Iowa share almost nothing in common culturally.  The music, the food, the dialects, the nightlife, the religions, and the local history are nothing alike.  If you put someone from Boston and someone from Mississippi next to each other, they’d almost be a different species.  Hell, the accents alone would make it difficult to talk to each other.

We also had the puritans setting up shop in the northeast, and the Quakers and the Moravians setting up in the 1600’s.  We’ve had the Native Americans here for millennia, we’ve had the Spanish conquering and then losing the southwest again and again. We have Inuits in Alaska, and the vibrant culture of Hawaii to our west.  We also have the oldest* constitution in the world.

Notably all economic forecasts from all forecasting agencies turned out to be critically wrong for reasons that look strongly like political bias.

The Treasury's £4300 a week figure was also a deeply deceptive use of statistics, which even the BBC fact checked and stated was based on ""confusion"". It made it sound like a predicted change in GDP many years in the future was an actual bill that'd turn up on the doorstep. Of course nobody believes that Treasury staff don't know what GDP is, so it boils down to a deliberate attempt to mislead using jargon:

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36073201

Even the corrected bus number would have been a debatable use of statistics. The argument that it's wrong relies on the rebate being permanent, but what if voting to Remain had led to the EU abolishing the rebate? Or the UK trading away more of its rebate for reforms that never happened like Tony Blair did? After all, an entirely fear based argument of the form ""we can't leave"" would have carried the day, and the EU is utterly desperate for cash. It would have been surprising if they had not tried to do this.

So the field of economics is in a really bad state. Wasn't it Haldane who said that Brexit was economics Michael Fish moment?

&gt;You're right, the reason that the EU formed, the USSR collapsed, the Cold War ended, and the consequent peace, it was all just nuclear weapons and people being afraid of the prospect of the United States military destroying the world as a viable counter-strategy.

These are all totally different concepts, and only ""the long peace"" as you say can be explained by nuclear weapons. Following world war two the USSR and the USA were by far the worlds most powerful countries (I think USA had literaelly like 60% of the entire worlds money). The bipolar system (two main countries) usually leads to war (cold war) but it for one of the first times in history it didn't end in two countries starting to fight each other (because that meant both countires, and the world would be dead), but instead lead to ideological warfar (usa fighting rise of communism) proxy wars (vietnam), as well as a global arms race. This continueduntil the end of the cold war (caused by usa bankrupting USSR, a lot to do with tech advances in USA in 70s that USSR couldnt keep up with)

The EU formed to try and stop hundreds of years of warfar between the countries. The EU forming had almost nothing to do with ""free flow of ideas"" but was instead a plan to join the countries economically so that going to war would be financially too costly, and impossible since the means of production was spread out. 

Realist school of thought would say the current peace has to do with USA power and nuclear weapons (google hegemonic stability theory), but multiculturalism changing our unified outlook on foreign policy is severely degrading that. You can also try googling democratic peace theory, which is also failing because of multiculturalism which people see democracy as an avenue for those not ethnically them to control their lives.

&gt;Had nothing to do with the free flow of people from one area to another, the mixing of ideas and cultural values, and the breakdown of cultural identity barriers inherent in the spread of mass media and moreover internet.

It really has nothing to do with that. There's no ""tolerance and apathy peace theory"" that's not how war works.

PennyPriddy,,,"The veins of protestant churches I've attended (which seem like they fit with the majority of American protestant churches, at least in the north) seem to take anywhere between an hour and an hour and a half. Some outliers take 2, if you've got someone who gives a really long sermon.

That might get longer if you have Sunday School after or before (rather than during), since different churches do that different ways. Some don't have adult Sunday school, since they have Bible study during the week. Some have ""children's church"" during the main service which more closely mirrors adult church (all the kids are in one room singing and listening to stories) with aged down content (less sermons about ""adult content,"" sometimes includes puppets or felt boards), while others have Sunday School during service which is split more tightly by age and is more likely to have interactive content (question and answer, small group crafts and games, etc).

But in most churches I've seen, it's at most an all morning affair, not usually an all day.

If it was in a foreign language for an English speaker it might not have represented protestant churches as a whole (especially US protestant churches).

REdEnt,,,"Basically, in Europe ""libertarian"" is more akin to describing anti-statist socialists than free market capitalists. I don't think theres a ""movement"" like we see in America because, generally, European countries have a cadre of different political parties that can exert their influence rather than people of like ideals having to ""take over"" the party ""closest to them"" in order to make any headway.

Here's Noam Chomsky talking on the subject:

&gt;['Libertarian' throughout European history meant 'socialist-anarchist.' The worker's movement--the socialist movement--sort of broke into 2 branches, one statist, one anti-statist. The statist branch led to Bolshevism and Lenin and Trotsky and so on; the anti-statist branch, which included left-Marxists like Rosa Luxumberg, kind of merged with a big strain of anarchism into what was called 'libertarian socialism.' So 'libertarian' in Europe always meant 'socialist.' Here, it means ultra-Ayn Rand or Cato Institute or something like that. But that's a special US usage having to do with the--there are a lot of things special here.""](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyOnTheOriginalMeaningOflibertarian)

&gt; O presidente Michel Temer ainda não tomou decisão, mas seus auxiliares dizem que seria um ""retrocesso"" proibir aplicativos de transporte de passageiros. Ministros próximos a Temer afirmam que é preciso pensar em alternativas para criar condições de concorrência no setor, como financiamento para motoristas de táxi, para que esses tenham acesso a tecnologias semelhantes às dos aplicativos. O ministro Moreira Franco (Secretaria-Geral), um dos principais aliados do presidente, disse que uma das possibilidades analisadas é um subsídio, via Caixa Econômica Federal, para taxistas. Para ele, o mais ""razoável"" é criar, com esses financiamentos, ""programas que qualifiquem os motoristas de táxi ou Uber"" e, segundo ele, dar ""acesso a instrumentos para que eles elaborem seus aplicativos, por exemplo, e possam conviver num ambiente de concorrência"". Os senadores retiraram do texto quatro pontos que aproximavam os aplicativos dos táxis: as exigências de placa vermelha e de que os motoristas sejam donos dos carros, a possibilidade de regulamentação pelas prefeituras e a restrição de atuação só na cidade de registro do veículo. O diretor de comunicação da Uber, Fabio Sabba, chegou a ser agredido enquanto concedia uma entrevista ao jornal espanhol ""El País"". Também seria necessária autorização específica do poder público municipal e a placa vermelha O que foi aprovado nesta terça-feira (31), no Senado Os senadores fizeram modificações no texto que veio da Câmara, após pressão de empresas de aplicativos de transporte.

cheertina,,,"&gt;Lets say i'm a Russian and I want to buy an anti Hilary Clinton ad. I have done nothing wrong in Russian law and I haven't broken any FB rules. Am I not allowed to spend my money to say I don't like HC?

You can spend money in Russia to do it.  You can spend money in Europe to do it.  You can't spend money in America to do it.

&gt;The Act and Commission regulations include a broad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States. 52 U.S.C. § 30121 and generally, 11 CFR 110.20. In general, foreign nationals are prohibited from the following activities:

&gt;* Making any contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or making any expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement in connection with any federal, state or local election in the United States;
&gt;* Making any contribution or donation to any committee or organization of any national, state, district, or local political party (including donations to a party nonfederal account or office building account);
&gt;* Making any disbursement for an electioneering communication;
&gt;* Making any donation to a presidential inaugural committee.

&gt;Persons who knowingly and willfully engage in these activities may be subject to an FEC enforcement action, criminal prosecution, or both.

Facebook should not allow you to purchase the ad at all.

Now, you and your friend can chat all you want about the election.  You can tell them everything horrible about the candidate.  But you can't spend money on any attempt to influence the election (legally - obviously you _can_ if they don't know, but it's against the law).  If that means you go to another service, sucks for facebook, but that's US law.  No other platform that's hosted in the US should be allowed to sell you ads either, though, so leaving FB isn't going to actually solve your problem, necessarily.

&gt;I actually like FB's proposed solution better than these and you can see why they have decided to go this way. They propose to clearly display what content is paid for and where the payment came from. This is a much better step in the right direction that ""Block all foreign money"" because that statement means nothing. FB is global. All posts and content are in a global pool of posts, so as far as FB is concerned all money should be allowed to pay for any/all content because otherwise you end up with FB USA that follows US law and FB Saudi that follows saudi law.

That's a good step too, but if you're reporting where the payment came from, and you know the currency, it's a _trivial_ first step to not allow political ads from foreign countries in foreign currencies.  Yes, they can get around it by buying them in Dollars and having someone in the US purchase it, but it's a good first check.  If you have to be 21 to buy beer then checking IDs should be required, but you can also skip that step and just refuse to sell it to grade-school children.

&gt;FB cannot be the police and keep up with every law in every country and adapt their platform to suit everyone at once because if one country bans FB then they can't operate anywhere.

They can and they kinda have to.  They're obligated to follow the laws of everywhere they want to operate.

&gt;Otherwise you end up with a FB in each region and whats the point of FB anymore? No one wants to use one site to talk to their US friends and then another service to talk to friend A in country A and yet another service to talk to friend B in country B etc.

So we should just throw out laws because they potentially make Facebook less popular?",True,0,1509551979,,False,0,dp6zpfp,False,t3_79z4i6,t1_dp6jf0w,/r/politics/comments/79z4i6/franken_blasts_facebook_for_accepting_rubles_for/dp6zpfp/,1512018633,1.0,False,politics,t5_2cneq,public,

I lean independent/libertarian/conservative and support Trump’s MAGA agenda.

My time at college, the Asian crowd I enjoyed hanging the most were the engineers and international students. The pre-med, pre-pharm, be a doctor-cause-parents-said-so Asian American crowd were the most toxic to Asian identity imo. They were the most white worshipping, status worshipping, superficial crowd who will use you to get an A in their pre-med classes. I avoided them after experiencing them first hand lol.

That is Herman Rosenblat, ""holocaust survivor"". I that video you can very clearly tell hes just making shit up. Does that proove the holocaust didnt happen? No. Because one guy saying anything doesnt make it true. So im meant to dismiss physical evidence on an easily coercable Nazi's word? 


&gt;Mass executions happened in both death camps and in Jewish ghettos- like the purge of Warsaw and the murders at 

Im talking about the holocaust

&gt;You can choose to ignore the statements of the Germans,

There are many germans who deny the holocaust, Theyre in jail for it. There were many germans who said the holocaust was real, they were already prisoners. Im not going to take any of their words at face value.

&gt;the video and photo graphs,

No video shows gas chambers in operation, no photos show mass killings. Photos of bodies only prooves people died, it does not prove murder. And when those bodies are starved, it leads me to believe they were starved to death.

&gt;- there are people today who say the planes on 9/11 where not real- 

Its isnt illegal to say they werent

 &gt;the laws regarding the Holocaust where passed in Europe,

no shit huh

&gt;many people lost friends and family to the death camps and that issue is still very relevant in Europe today

moral platitudes arent an argument. the truth fears no investigation. When you have to lock people in a cage to stop them from speaking all it means is they have something to say

culegflori,,,"Acum mai multi ani de zile faceam niste cursuri de limba straina, si in pauze/dupa program mai stateam de vorba cu colegii. Printre acesti colegi era si o tipa cu care mai vorbeam de una-alta. Intre timp am aflat ca ea era casatorita [moment in care interesul mi s-a dus in podea, nu-s in afacerea spartului de casnicii], dar relatia ei era in dificultate. Mi-a tot povestit lucruri ce s-au intamplat, cum sotul ei era un momma's boy, cu soacra-sa era o narcisista dusa cu pluta, cum ala i-a facut chestii nasoale etc etc, cert e ca acea casnicie era o varza fara viitor. Pana sa terminam cursurile mi-a spus ca a inceput procedurile de divort, lucru usor de inteles avand in vedere lucrurile pe care mi le-a spus despre casnicia lor. 

In acest moment nu eram cu mult mai interesat sa fac vreo miscare, simpatizam cu situatia in care sa gasea dar cam atat. Treaba s-a schimbat cand intr-o seara mi-a trimis un mesaj pe messenger dupa ce facusem schimb de id-uri cu toti colegii [da, pe vremea aia inca mai o ardeam pe yahoo messenger lol], lucru care mi-a ridicat o spranceana avand in vedere ca foarte rar ma aborda cineva acolo. A doua spranceana am ridicat-o cand conversatia s-a dus extrem de repede de la ""salut, ce mai faci?"" la ea trimitandu-mi o imagine cu pozitii din Kama Sutra si ea intrebandu-ma pe care le-am facut. Pe de-o parte am sesizat foarte repede care-s intentiile ei si cat de trashy era abordarea, pe de alta nu mai fusesem in vreo relatie de aproape 2 ani de zile si adevarul e ca eram curios cum se va desfasura treaba asta, asa ca am dat curs abordarii ei. Avand in vedere ca era in proces de divort am considerat ca era ca si cum n-ar fi fost casatorita, altfel nu faceam nimic cu ea.

Nu am avut ideea ca o sa am o relatie cu ea ca la carte, avand in vedere cum m-a abordat mi s-a lasat de inteles ca ea doar isi dorea sex cu cineva cu care era familiara, dar treaba a evoluat intr-o relatie si nu m-a deranjat. Ma intelegeam ok cu ea, aveam ce sa conversam si fara sa va mint am avut parte de cel mai bun sex din viata mea cu ea, dar individa clar ca avea mari dificultati emotionale din cauza a prin ce trecuse. Cand a mai si aflat ca fostul sot [ca intre timp se si finalizase divortul] o inselase spiritul ei pur si simplu s-a prabusit, si oricat am incercat s-o sustin ea se comporta din ce in ce mai... instabil. Nu self-harm sau chestii de genul asta, ci o atitudine tot mai ostila la adresa mea, bazandu-se pe faptul ca am tendinta sa-mi spun punctul de vedere chiar daca este contradictoriu cu a altora, ea parca intentionat imi spunea ca nu-i de acord cu mine, ca n-am dreptate, ca nu e adevarat ce spun eu no matter what, ca si cum ma momea sa ma iau la harta cu ea. Treaba a evoluat la ea acuzandu-ma ca as fi profitat de ea, lucru care m-a deranjat foarte tare avand in vedere ca nu eu am abordat-o si mereu i-am spus ca facem ce facem doar daca isi doreste ea acest lucru pentru ca fix sa fiu un profitor n-am dorit sa fiu. Dupa asta usor de inteles ca relatia s-a incheiat, tineam la ea si intelegeam ca nu e in apele ei dpdv emotional, dar nu avea rost sa trag de o relatie pe care nici ea nu si-o mai dorea, mai ales ca ea incepuse sa se dea si la un amic de-al meu care era complet dezinteresat de ea, lucuri aflate simultan de la ea [nu stiu ce reactie spera sa obtina de la mine spunandu-mi asta, sa fiu sincer] si de la el. Dupa mine a mai avut vreo 2 relatii super scurte, asa ca ea a fost val-vartej si dupa ce ne-am despartit.

Nu am mai pastrat legatura cu ea, singura conversatie pe care am mai avut-o a fost vreun an de zile mai tarziu si mi-a spus ca ar fi fost la un psiholog si a ajutat-o foarte mult, dar altceva nu stiu despre ce-a mai facut de atunci.

The_OPs_Mommy,,,"Well, certain federal LE agencies, DN task forces, university research groups, various private companies focused on ""Darkweb Intelligence"", as well as miscellaneous consortiums of the above mentioned entities[**^1**](http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/141335_en.html) - all will inject money into the markets, follow the subsequent transactions, and (at minimum) graph out a rough topography of the money flow associated with each given market. 

They do this pretty much in the way you'd expect:  

* sign up for hundreds of accounts  
* deposit small, unique-ish amounts (e.g., ฿ 0.00054321 ≈ $3.50)  
* they'll make note of how often an account's `deposit address` changes, and if any address ever gets reused across accounts.  
On earlier marketplaces (using older versions of the bitcoin daemon) address reuse/cycling was a common implementation; which made it trivial for sites like WalletExplorer/ChainAnalysis to determine which addresses belonged to say, [*Nucleus Market*](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/NucleusMarket/addresses) or [*AlphaBay Marketplace*](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/AlphaBayMarket/addresses). 
This is how *Coinbase* and the like could preemptively block transactions headed for those markets.    
* once their money is on the market, they'll do various things like withdraw the money - the inputs to that transaction will typically give them some a trove of addresses belonging to the market's hot-wallet.  
* they will also make purchases (usually digital goods because it's just quicker) and follow where the money goes.  
* likewise, some entities (mainly LE) will even fork over the dough for a vendor bond, just so that they can make escrow purchases from themselves. This basically exposes the entire inner workings of the market and if they do this enough times, they'll acquire all of the addresses associated with the marketplace's internal tumbler.  


 Once the market has gotten large enough to warrant a dedicated task force assigned to bringing it down, there will be people in the FBI, IRS, and Europol who will likely know as much about the financial architecture of the market as the developers do.

*****  


If they wanted to track a *specific* vendor, they would just buy from them on the markets a couple of times and then shoot them a message and ask to do a DD. That would cut out the guesswork of trying to track them through the market. 

If LE gets lucky (and if the vendor is anything like 80% of their peers) they'll get lazy or complacent and reuse addresses. They may even provide the wallet address to which they withdraw their money from the market (smh).  

From there, LE just needs to watch the blockchain until those funds wind up at a (subpoenable) exchange and then it's game over.

Fidget11,,,"&gt; What you said in your messages were anything but a reasoned and civilised attempt at a conversation

Really? because I cited the reasons that inform my opinion of what will go on and why I believe that Belgium will ultimately push him to return to Spain. 

I get that you are triggered because I pointed out that the former president is behaving in a cowardly manner. I am sorry that you cant accept the reality that he is not willing to stand up for his convictions when it really counts. 

Also, you seem to think that I am saying they share ideological views with the Trump supporters, that is not the case. What is the case though is that both believe things that are not objectively true. Where Trump supporters believe the myriad bullshit accusations that Trump makes about Hillary, Catalans believe the bullshit about how the region will be wealthier outside of Spain, and would be in the EU. Both of which are objectively false. 

They may not share ideological beliefs but they certainly do share a common faith in the completely untrue words of politicians who are not able to live up to their claims. 

&gt;why would i discuss with someone who openly insults and despises someone else for what they defend peacefully and democratically.

I dont despise someone for what they defend peacefully or democratically. But I do despise political leaders who lie to their people and who rely on falsehood to win elections. Further, the referendum was not democratic or in the interests of democracy, nor was the ""declaration of independence"".

xforce-,,,"there's 300 to 350.000 turks in greater london, out of a total population of 8 778 500, which is approx 4%.

Now, these are in all age ranges, having migrated since the 60s, 70s,


applied to the whole UK which has a population of 65,648,000  , its about 500.000 spread across the whole country, the majority of them in London
which is not even touching 1%

Now you're probably going to try to argue, with using the numbers of ALL immigrants in the UK, which is of course much higher because of their immigration policy since the 60s,
but thats not exactly the Turks fault, so why would you feel bad about their policy choices

if you want to take the super example of germany, which is supposedly becoming muslim and a second turkey very soon, its only 3-4 million Turks, spread evenly across all age groups, many of them older, and in retirement age soon, meanwhile they took 1 million in one year alone, of whom 70-90% are young men ((!)) age 15 to 30


meanwhile Turkey, a country of  about 80 million, took 3-5 million immigrants, in just the last 5 years, all of them in a younger age range, which is 3 to 6.25% spread across the whole population


and you write  ""I can understand the europeans feel bad about migration "" 

so if you look at migration as a whole it is true, in parts of these countries school and preschool children are 10 to 50% children of migrants, and the demographic change is happening, but there is no reason you have to feel bad for it as a turk since it is not our fault, it was their policy to let these people in   , they voted in the politicians who made these policies for decades, and they are stlil doing it, depending on who you ask, they still want more migration, now public opinion is turning, but still onle 10-15% of the country openly voted against these policies

so they are getting what they voted for, not that I think it is good, or would agree with it,


summary: its not the turks fault, theres really not as many turks in the UK, Germany or anywhere else in europe as you might think , you took in more Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans in 5 years, then they took in in 5 decades

trump was tweeting about it a few hours after it happened, the guy was in surgery, all he knew was that it was a muslim looking guy.

It's actually really strange. All of the companies mentioned in the child comments are Central European, whether you're looking at Germany (PB), Czechia, or Poland.

thealtright,,,"&gt;about inbreeding in the Arab world

I didn't say people should inbreed. Obviously inbreeding and incest will cause problems. Pakistanis (See [here](https://youtu.be/9aAD0yJ3SdQ) and [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/11723308/First-cousin-marriages-in-Pakistani-communities-leading-to-appalling-disabilities-among-children.html) for example) and Jews (See [here](http://www.jewishgeneticdiseases.org) and [here](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ashkenazi-jewish-genetic-diseases) for example) in particular are notorious for this.

&gt;I promise I hadn't heard of race mixing. I sort of take that as a given - it's why we don't look the same. It's why none of us look the same.

The reason we don't look the same all over the world is because of evolution, climate, environment etc. and because there are different races and they, in their present state, *didn't* all race mix with each other. You're right in the sense that there was mixing with previous hominids though like Neanderthals and Denisovans. For example [sub-Saharan Africans have no Neanderthal DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5HZhB4ecS8) whereas everyone else does (Europeans, Asians etc.).

&gt;Please could you provide a source on this? It goes against reproductive biology. 

Here's just one example:

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-09/ethnicity-bone-marrow-donations-needle-in-haystack/8565320

Unfortunately I don't have time right now to do all the legwork for you and make a comprehensive list but maybe I will come back and edit a few more in later when I have more time. There are of course many many examples (even if you only stick to the biological ones nevermind all the psychological ones).

&gt; if you keep fucking your cousin's cousin for generation after generation, you get into a genetic bind 

I didn't say you should fuck your cousin.

&gt;If you wanna ensure genetic health, you leave the nest and find a much more distant relative to fuck.

Yes, by ""distant relative"" you mean someone of your same race that is not a family member. Even indigenous Europeans (white people), that are currently only [6.5% of the total world population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people), still have easily a large enough population that this isn't a problem. Breeding with a member of another race just to avoid some potential minuscule chance that you might unknowingly breed with one of your cousins is unnecessary. It's a non-issue. Of course the smaller and smaller a population becomes the more difficult that is. If there's only 100 people left on the planet of a particular race then it's going to be hard for them to find another member of their own kind to mate with that isn't related. Right now that isn't a problem though and it never will be as long as people continue to breed and produce offspring with members of their own race because then there will always be a large enough population.

&gt;And can you clarify: You don't find women of other races attractive? 

No, not really. I can appreciate beauty in people of other races and obviously I can see the difference between an ugly person of another race and a better looking person of that race but I don't find them attractive in the sense that I would want to reproduce with them and start a family. I can appreciate beauty in many things; animals, trees, mountains etc. 

I think the individual uniqueness and beauty of all distinct peoples should be preserved not destroyed. If you think that women of other races are beautiful and attractive then you should be against race mixing because if everyone mixed out then you would destroy the beautiful diversity of people. It seems you are of the mindset that some people have today where they want to destroy everything and create one mono cultural, mono racial, globalist new world order scenario where's there's just billions of coffee colored mongrelized people all living empty, rootless, consumerist and materialist lives all under the same global corporations with the same iphones, Starbucks etc. 

Personally I find this ideology sickening. If you squeeze out some oil paints from the tubes onto a palette you have a vast array of beautiful and unique colors all with their own qualities and applications but if you take a brush and blend them all together you get just one murky brown mess and once you do that it's impossible to separate them back out again.

&gt;Who's the most attractive woman on your mind right now? (A famous one.)

I don't know, I don't follow celebrity culture.

&gt;In the end we know that the slavers were fucking their slaves on a pretty broad scale.

Yes I'm sure many people that have owned slaves throughout history have had sex with their slaves and those slaves produced offspring. During the enslavement of Europeans many white European women were taken as sex slaves by the invading Muslim Arab slavers during the [Barbary slave trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade) for example. I'm sure some of the Greeks, Chinese, Romans, Mongols etc. would have had sex with their slaves and no doubt some Europeans had sex with African slaves during the transatlantic slave trade especially in South America. I think this was a bad thing, don't you? 

&gt;I think your theory of racial purity is intriguing

It's not ""my"" ""theory"".

&gt;I can't believe you don't find Beyonce attractive

I don't find Beyonce attractive.

&gt;ultimately it's biologically impossible

It's not biologically impossible to build families with people of the same race as you. People have been doing it successfully for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years.

&gt;You go for inbreeding; I'll go for outbreeding.

It is trying to reconvert to tourism (started some time around the 2006 Winter Olympic games), but I doubt that the money derived from tourism can replace the jobs provided by one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world.

Trieste lost a big part of its former importance with the collapse of the Austro Hungarian empire and it joining the Kingdom of Italy. In A-H it was THE port of the empire (technically Fiume/Rjeka was meant to be for the Hungarian half of the empire what Trieste was for the Austrian part, but in reality Trieste never had any serious contender), in Italy, well, we don't have stortage of ports. It still has a relatively important port, but being cut off from its natural economic backyard (i.e. Austria+Balkans) and finding itself on the edge of the iron curtain was a huge blow. Hopefully with the enlargement of the EU, it can regain some of its former strategic importance.

Not being able to expand beyond its current borders (we could reclaim some land like the Dutch, but the lagoon as an ecosystem would be in danger) and being cut off from one of the defining traits of modernity ( i.e. motorization) makes it difficult to reconcile Venice with modern urban life.

dolan313,flair1,Latvia has more shootings per capita YOU FUCKING CUCK,"Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs.

PM_ME_LUCID_DREAMS,,,"&gt; So far, all societies have tended to reduce their population growth rate as they become more technologically developed and economically successful. Likely reasons include better access to birth control (so having kids is a choice), better childhood health care (if your kids are unlikely to die, you don't need as many), and better retirement plans (so you're not dependent on your kids to take care of you when you get old).

This GCSE reasoning isn't as good of an explanation as Reddit always likes to think. There are huge differences even in Europe, with deathly low birth rates in Italy and Germany, but near-replacement rates in Ireland and France.

Some countries defy this model, e.g. Israel.

&gt; Europe is a world leader in all of these factors, so it's no surprise that its population should be stabilizing more rapidly.

Why thank you, but this is wrong.

Firstly, Europe's population isn't stabilising. Stabilising would imply birth rates of near replacement rates, something that only a few countries (e.g. Ireland and France) can boast. Were it not for immigration, it would be in free-fall for most countries.

There are plenty of places on the continent where technological development lags far behind - e.g. eastern Europe, which has some of the lowest birth rates in Europe.

Birth rates are a very complicated thing.

BennyBarner,,,"&gt; Hitler and friends' plan the entire time was genocidal. The plan was to wipe out most of Eastern Europe and make it a German colony, where the surviving Slavic population were turned into slaves for Germans. This was called the Generalplan Ost, or Master plan for the East. 

But this came as a consequence of the political escalation, as far as I know. 

The plan for the settlement of Sovjet Russia was part of the larger post-war strategy. They didn't just want to militarily defeat the communists, they also wanted to control the area and dispose of the Marxist doctrines entirely. 

&gt;The Final Solution is actually a shorthand for the full phrase ""the Final Solution to the Jewish Question"". Hitler first let out a hint that he was planning on exterminating all the Jews in 1939:

Already in 1933 the Germans had an alliance with the Zionist Jews to transfer Jewish people from Germany to Palestine. That's what the first concentration camps were built for. When war broke out the Germans turned some of the concentration camps into labour camps instead.

I think the reason the trust does not exist is because US wont treat it as an equal partner.  Which is really sad because both these countries should really have the best of relationships.  Your point about India not wanting to be bestees with the USA is not the best way to go.  Having a special relationship with the US pays dividends beyond technology transfer.  The special relationship between US and UK has been very valuable to UK beyond technology.  Same for US and Australia.

&gt;First, sweeping generalization.

I thought that was obvious? You can't type a country

&gt;Second, he didn't even capture the essence of the countries.

I actually thought I did, more than the Europe one, the only countries you can *disagree* on in this are Japan and maybe South Korea.

&gt;His reasoning is based on shallow stereotypes

Yes

&gt;""Japanese prioritize society over individual"" and ""Koreans are polite""

When did I say that? 

&gt;As a half-Japanese person who actually lived there for a considerable amount of time, I think his reasoning is ridiculous and belongs to r/shittymbti. For one thing, **there's very strong Fi presence in Japan.**

Explain why, I'm interested. I made this thread to have some sort of discussion, but I see everyone taking it as trolling.
I'm not Japanese, so you may dismiss my opinion altogether, but that would be honestly sad.

When it comes to Japan you'll have the weeaboos typing it as Ne something because of animes and you'll have the others type it as ISTJ because ""boring duty fulfillers"". My personal opinion, if you want to have a civil discussion you can correct me, is that Japan values Fe. I see it as a very collectivist culture, where people value helping/being kind/having a support system more than Te for example. It comes off very differently from other, widely agreed upon, ISTJ countries. 

&gt; He labeled China and NK as ESTP because of the political structure of the countries, disregarding culture, history, individual citizens, etc. If anything, NK is more like an INFJ's dream gone bad.

NK as an ESTP was a joke typing based on Kim Jong-un, kind of like typing the US as an ESTP because of Trump. Nobody has an idea of what kind of country it is.

China is an extremely diverse country, so it is hard to give it a single type.

I finished Season 6 with around 2450 SR on Gold and this season I want to try to get to Diamond. My career high was 2517 SR/Platinum.

specifically: 

&gt;Despite the edicts of canon law and the real risk of punishment, it appears that unrestrained sexual activity was quite common throughout Europe during these times. In fact, most did not believe fornication was a sin at all, and many were taken by surprise at confession when priests informed them that they had indeed sinned by committing certain sexual acts. St. Vincent Ferrer (1350-1419) claimed that by age fifteen, all young men had lost their virginity (Richards, 38). There are also suggestions that rural populations were much more accepting of illicit sexual behavior, and that country folk were viewed as much more ""free"" sexually than urban dwellers (Richards, 36). Lastly, although premarital sex was obviously considered sinful by the church, in reality, once couples were betrothed, they often slept together during a sort of ""trial period"" before the wedding. That way, if one or both were not satisfied with the results, they might still attempt to release themselves from future consent to marry (sometimes by becoming godparents of the same child, a relationship which would lead to an incestuous union) (Brundage, 436-7).",True,0,1509559778,,1509559972,0,dp77m46,False,t3_79p6dn,t1_dp76tte,/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/79p6dn/discussion_women_reporting_a_divorce_by_total/dp77m46/,1512022872,3.0,False,PurplePillDebate,t5_2ya42,public,

MortalSisyphus,iden,RightRealist.com,"Tribalism is simply evolved behavior found in all primates.

The reason tribalism has evolved is that it provides distinct survival advantages. A group will always outcompete an individual. Outsiders of the tribe present a very real threat to the survival of the group, such as foreign diseases. Perhaps the most clear example of this is the way Europeans introduced smallpox to the Native Americans which devastated their population. It would thus make much sense for Native Americans to fear and avoid the European settlers. The second threat that outsiders pose is violence and the taking of land and resources. There are hundreds of examples of this throughout history. Finally, outsiders carry the threat of impregnating female tribal members, causing immense harm to the males who have invested time and effort to protecting their women.

It is self-evident that humans carry these same tribalistic impulses. While in the past we would separate ourselves into literal ethnic tribes, today we separate ourselves into various other divisions. The ""us vs. them"" tribalist mentality can be found in sports, religion, nationalism, gangs, and everywhere in between. Even members of a city or town may divide themselves geographically, and take pride in being part of the ""west/north/east/south"" side of town.

When I first learned about our evolved tribalism, I felt it was something that needed to be overcome. I felt it was backwards and harmful, that it led to unnecessary violence and division. This was my social conditioning coming out, as well as the mentality I had gained from reading libertarian philosophy.

It wasn't until many years later that I recognized tribalism as essential. We should not fight against our human nature, rather we should embrace it. There is much wisdom in nature, and it is arrogant to think we know better than millions of years of evolution. Science is starting to catch up to this wisdom of nature. Work has been done suggesting that ethnocentric cooperation is a more effective strategy than humanistic cooperation.

http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/16/3/7.html

When a nation is ethnically and culturally homogeneous, there is greater social cohesion. People feel a stronger connection to other members of the group, and this is manifested in their behavior. There is a greater willingness to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of the group, and less inclination to harm or steal from the members of your own tribe. Tribalism simply creates a more effective, cooperative, well-functioning society.

Multiculturalism is fundamentally unnatural. It creates divisions in society on a biological level. And division leads to dysfunction.

When an immigrant ethnic group becomes large enough in a foreign society, they cease assimilating and begin to coalesce into a distinct tribe. Whole cities become segregated according to race, language, and culture. The nation literally splits in two, with two distinct and often opposing tribes living within the same borders and under the same laws. This is a recipe for disaster. Violence and strife is inevitable. The ideal nation will draw it's borders in such a way as to ensure a people with a generally shared culture and ethnicity, and this formation must be protected at the nation's borders. A nation without borders is no nation at all.

Obrigado pelos escapulários! Eu os recebi pelo correio ontem. Hoje eu fui ao banco e descobri um problema. Meu banco cobra uma taxa muito alta para enviar dinheiro para fora do país. Além disso, eles exigem uma quantia mínima para ser enviada, que é uma quantia relativamante alta. Eu falei com eles e eles me deram um cheque. Eu enviei o cheque nos correios hoje. Eu estou ciente que vocês provavelmente recebem muitas correspondências então procurem por uma carta dos Estados Unidos com tinta azul no envelope. O hoje no meu banco falou que você pode simplesmente depositar o cheque e ele será convertido em Euro automaticamente. Eu escrevi instruções junto com o cheque. Eu realmente me desculpo por qualquer problema que eu possa ter causado com esse assunto. Por favor não hesite em me avisar se houver algum problema ou se você precisar (que envie) o dinheiro por um método diferente. Se precisar, eu daria um jeito imediatamente.

Genetic traits are real. That doesn't mean that there is one, single, Italian genetic trait. As you said, most people have such diverse ancestries that there is no clear primary ethnic trait. But, as you freely admitted, you might have Spanish, Greek, Arab, or Swedish traits in your DNA. How is that any more or less racist than me saying that Italian Americans might have some Italian traits. Clearly, you have no issue referring to ethnic genetic traits, so long as it's to support your argument. You need to think in more regional terms. If I say someone has some Italian genetic traits, it just means that the person has similar traits to people who live/lived in that, or similar, areas. I never claimed that any people of any country have ""tightly-coupled genetic material"". That is, indeed, a myth. This is just a straw man argument. I guess you are used to dealing with a lot of Fascists in Italy. I'm sorry for that.

richuncleskeleton666,,,"IMO america doesn't have very stringent vetting. I used to be a merchant seaman, as such i've been through the customs and immigration systems of a lot of different countries. American customs and immigration is nowhere near extreme. Try visiting Iran, I had a 20 min interview with an official before i was allowed to carry out my regular duties upon my own ship, that wasn't even for going ashore. To put that in context the California border patrol asked me a couple of questions but were more interested in searching my cabin for drugs. 

There has been a trend in european countries for people who have already been known to intelligence services but deemed a low risk committing terror attacks. 

I think what some commentators are trying to say is by making criteria more stringent for who we consider a threat we will likely stop more attacks and there is definitely logic in that. That being said, i don't believe Trump is doing this for any other reason than political ones and doesn't care if it works or not. Politically he needs to appear to be responding to the situation.

ultimately people who are dedicated to carrying out terror attack will succeed some of the time. it will be impossible to prevent every terror attack, as soon as a pattern is identified and countered terrorists will switch tactics. What is important to remember is that all these responses are designed to give the appearance the government is doing something. the terror threat level is always raised after an attack (at least in the uk) they never raise it just before attack (because the dont know when the next one is coming)

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; Russia was the strongest state to come out of the USSR, and they were expected to take on the debts of the Soviet Union. Considering that, it's only natural that they take the responsibility of the USSR's position on the security council. Plus of course Russia has one of the strongest nuclear forces in the world. 

All of those things belonged to the Soviet Union. The nukes, the debts, etc. Kazakhstan and Ukraine for example also had large nuclear stockpiles after the USSR collapsed, but they were *not interested* in maintaining that status any more. Russia however was. Russia decided to take those up on itself, and so while technically not correct, it is fair to use the two synonymously since Russia was the dominant power in the USSR.

&gt; The tendency of Americans to refer to the USSR as Russia isn't a testament about the role of Russia in the USSR, but rather the layperson understanding most Americans have about politics and history. The USSR was built just as much by Ukrainians and etc than just by Russians. The USSR actually concentrated more development outside of Russia than within Russia to prevent Russian primacy.

I'm not going to defend ignorance of Americans but in this case it has not much to do with it. It's not just Americans that do this. I already told you, Europeans do it, South Americans do it, Africans do it. It's all colloquial. Most people are well aware that Russia was just the largest republic of the USSR.

&gt; What I was referring to as Russo phobic was the implication that the entire Red Army was some kind of undisciplined rape machine. 

Where did I make this claim or anything even resembling it? I never made such a claim. Was the German military an undisciplined rape machine? Yet they raped and murdered millions. The Soviets did the same. By far the most brutal militaries in WW2 were the Germans, Japanese, and the Soviets, BY FAR. This is the fact. Of course everyone was brutal but there are degrees. It is no coincidence that Germans for example preferred to surrender to the Western Allies.

Your claim of ""2nd rate divisions"" from ""Central Asia"" did this is ridiculous and seems to try to deflect blame and you also provide no source. 

&gt; I'd simply say that you shouldn't learn your history from wikipedia, instead you should look at scholarly works from both Russians and Westerners and compare and contrast the evidence presented. The evidence and works which I have read point to the fact that rape only really became widespread after the frontline forces moved on and second rate divisions entered the territory. This is also confirmed by German accounts.

If you want I can provide 100 other links from other sources, wikipedia was just a convenient one, but that's not the point. Are you seriously denying this information? Scholarly works from Russians? Come on man, you can't be serious. 

Russians are not honest brokers in covering history, especially their own history. They didn't even admit to the Katyn massacre till the USSR collapsed even though everyone knew.

&gt; This is also confirmed by German accounts.

Which German accounts? Can you provide them?

12Feb1809,,,"&gt;Again, you are citing a Wahhabist website which is outside the mainstream. It would be like me citing Westboro Baptist church as a reference when claiming what Christianity believes on gays.

That is absolutely not an equivalent. If you really think so, then why don't you go on /r/Islam and suggest that wahabi/salafi Islam is similar to Westboro Baptist Church. Westboro has a handful of members, absolutely no one supports them. Wahabi/salafi Islam is the dominant Islam in the GCC Arabs countries, led by Saudi Arabia. And they have extreme influence in many, many Muslim countries. Both at the govt and individual level. Also, a significant number of scholars are associated with wahabi/salafi thought, and most mosques built in the west in the last few decades have been funded by them. Which is also why they have some influence in the west as well among Muslims. Like I said, post that question on /r/Islam and see what happens. They will be offended by the use of the word wahabi, and will ask you to say salafi instead. And then let's see how it goes.

Additionally, you can ignore the opinions in the link. But the sources are valid. You asked for sources, you got them. You can disagree with the ruling/opinion, totally makes sense. But it's quite clear that Quran, Hadith, Sunnah and Sahaba's actions are all less than exemplary toward gay people.

&gt; We've already removed many punishments for adultery and homosexuality around the world, both by secular governments and religious governments reinterpreting the religion. 

The conversation is about Islam itself. Not about countries specifically. Can Islam, the belief structure, be modified to become more accepting, more inclusive, more equal. 

&gt; Meanwhile I worked in a Christian country that still hands out 25-year prison sentences for homosexuality. I don't think it's fair to single us out.

Horrific. There's no singling out. Anyone who has laws like this is terrible. Uganda, Russia are just some examples. And countries in Europe had terrible laws just a few decades ago. Comparing oneself to the lowest bar isn't the way to go.  Trying to move ahead is really something to strive for. 

You are getting very defensive, not sure why. I don't think you're any less accepting of different lifestyles than I am or anyone else is. I think most Muslims are extremely accepting. No different than any community  of people. But at the dogma level, there's room for improvement. 

Is any culture/belief system/nation/community better off by maintaining restrictive and oppressive views and rules on homosexuality? Or does it serve everyone better by promoting greater tolerance, greater acceptance, greater equality? I know my answer.

I agree that HOI is a wargame and not a politics one (unlike EU) but I actually enjoy the little bit of politics that the KR team got into their mod.

You're so ill informed it's actually sad. Federal crown land is not the same as provincial crown land. The Crown in the Right of Canada owns the national parks and the CFB's, not the province. It wouldn't become default property of the province because it belongs to the Government of Canada.

Not to mention the dozens (if not hundreds) of Indian Reserves in Alberta. Each and every one is Federal land, not Provincial. Each and every one would remain part of Canada in the event of Alberta leaving confederation.

The numbers for Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe don't look any better.
Those views are not just reserved for that part of the world. A Gallop Poll of Muslims in the UK found that not a single one of the 1,001 people polled thought that homosexuality was morally acceptable. That is compared to 58% of the overall British population who think homosexuality is OK. The same poll found that just 35% of French Muslims and 19% of German Muslims thought homosexuality is morally acceptable.
Another poll of UK Muslims found that 52% believe homosexuality should be illegal. 23% would like to see Sharia law in England. 39% believe a woman should always obey her husband, as opposed to 5% of English people overall. 31% consider it acceptable for a man to have multiple wives.""

I don't think they're out of business, call them up. By the way, if you're going to drive down to the us and you don't know people, look up the nearest 5 star hotel, and ship it there. Obviously, let them know previously. Just tell them you need to be there in person and your schedule is wacky so you don't know when you need to register a room, if at all. They usually take care of your packages quite nicely.

As for quality, Altarwind has a reputation (that isn't bad mind you) but they tend to use subpar techniques. Bolts showing, cuts showing, joints showing, weird fixtures, etc. I've seen them at renaissance fairs and...for the price...not really impressed. But most people like them so I don't know maybe I'm the weirdo.

Walter Simmons is a good luthier, but he's European. All euromade instruments are obviously a bit superior. If I were you, I'd gather some money, do a bunch of research on eu luthiers, literally travel to Europe for 2 days, buy a gurdy, and come back.

It will end up being cheaper in the long run, and you won't have to deal with quality issues. As for instructor? haha, good luck finding one. Your best bet is buying an instructional DVD. I think Neil Brook sells one, and there's a german lady on youtube that has a DVD instructional as well. Closest thing is piano lessons as it's just an inverted keyboard.

The federal bureaucracy delivers - by far - the lowest ratio of (public services)/(resources used) in the world.  No one comes close.  Only the governments of Norther Europe consume a larger share of national economic activity, and these governments provide many, many more services for their citizens in return.  

I don't think it has anything to do with race; there are African countries that offer much more efficient government, and the Chilean government today is one of the best in the world.  

I think it has to do with leftists in America being under a general delusion that resources come from thin air and that leaning on shovels is OK, and both parties selling out to special interests.  

The Federal bureaucracy differs from Walmart in that if I stop shopping at Walmart the greeters aren't going to beat down my door, shove a machine gun in my face, and throw me in jail.  Ergo I have no business in their affairs.

Any game rule system is an abstraction of real-world physics. If you want real-world physics in a combat system check out The Morrow Project.

Second, this is one of the reasons the diagonal 5 foot/10 foot rule is helpful.

Third, the rule on cones (Specific example PH 204) is that a cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. In other words, a 15 foot cone extends 15 feet from point of origin, whether center or edge of the origination square - and determining that is usually up to the caster and/or the DM.

Fourth, Sage Advice is not authoritative. Only the Sage Compendium and the errata's are authoritative. That's why it has a banner and link saying ""Official Rules Answers"" which takes you to Sage Compendium. Anything up on sageadvice.eu is guidance only.

What could go wrong?

Also - if you are caught even jaywalking in Shenzhen (the home of our beloved Onepllus), you will be identified via face tracking, and a notification will be sent over WeChat (their ""facebook"") to publicly pop up on all your friends social media accounts, so they can shame you.

If you constantly ignore red lines, and people telling you that Oneplus' behavior in stealing their users data has been overboarding, exceptional, and extremely out of the ordenary - for any western standards, choosing ""not to believe that"", only drives away the voices that would have explained it to you. The problem then starts with you.

I dont feel any responsibility or kindship with people that choose to ignore or not believe, what is done with big data right here and right now. Just dont lie to the ones that might still care about not hyping a society, where algorihtms control all aspects of your life.

""Better advertising"" is a joke, if you think about whats already collected here. Oneplus took your cellphone number, your unique sim identifier, your cell tower id (thats location information, that can be used to track you already quite precisely), data on how often you pick up the phone, what apps you use, what you do IN those apps... And they had NO right to do so. Also - regardless how often you repeat that ""everybody does that"" - they dont. Companies usually see the need to follow legal ramifications for data gathering. Oneplus didnt. Not in the least. Also their data gathering operation was EXTENSIVE. Please dont joke about stuff like that, or one day you will find yourself waking up in a repressive society that thinks ""gaining citizen points"" is fun.

Also, I cant stress this enough - according to european law, everything they did, and they still do is illegal. Having costumers opt in into limitless surveilance without a stated cause (in a contract) and without asking a vast majority of their customers for consent (the toggle was added in the beginning of 2017, all customers using their phones before that NEVER saw it. Thats why they ""promised"" they would put up a notification to ask all of their customers ""retroactively"" after the media fallout. Their tracking was active before that - without any notification, without them asking for permission, without them explaining, that they were doing so).

Also - they still dont allow you to opt out of more than half of their tracking behavior - which, again is illegal. You are not using a ""service"" when you have paid for a Oneplus Phone - you are using a product you have bought. No one, ever - in none of the marketing material out there tells you, that by buying a Oneplus product, you agree on giving the company selling your PHONE access to personal data.

Cruxxor,eu g2,LANE KINGDOM,"&gt; to pretend EU has had domination had to head over NA is a straight up lie

Lul why u make up what I said? I never denied EU having pretty equal record in head-to-head. 

&gt; Saying ""they didn't care"" is bullshit as you have no evidence to support that. You're not them. I could say NA didn't care and still beat EU, proving their superiority

Drafts are facts. NA teams knew EU players pocketpicks and had prepared strategy for them. Best example was TSM stomping FNC after giving them Kennen + Shen, it was 100% obvious from the beginning it was a bait, but FNC had no other way but to take it, because they had 0 preparation and strategy, other than ""let's play our usual shit against teams we don't know and see how it goes lul"". 

It's not a coincidence that EU drafts completely sucked dick at RR and they got stomped, yet couple months later they do what they always do at Worlds. It's 100% obvious, it's fucking common sense - they didn't prepare for RR.

I never said anything about domination, but if they prepared, I would expect usual pretty equal run from both sides, maybe EU winning slightly, maybe NA winning slightly. But that stomp was an outlier, and it didn't came from nothing. Whole year, MSI, Worlds, it's business as usual. RR was only exception, and imho ""NA magically became 10x better and EU magically became total garbage for 3 days"" is much less believable explanation, than EU fucking up and not preparing, especially when G2 did this shit in the past in much more important tournament.

&gt; Hatebreed is a metalcore, thrash/groove metal band from Bridgeport and New Haven, Connecticut. The band was founded in November 1994 by Jamey Jasta, Dave Russo, Larry Dwyer, and Chris Beattie. Hatebreed's sound can be classified as metalcore. They are also influenced by groove metal. thrash, sludge and death metal. Their sound has heavily influenced many modern metalcore, hardcore punk and crossover bands.

&gt; They began by recording a three song demo and selling it to locals. Those three songs would eventually be released on a split seven inch with New York's Neglect in 1995. They followed that up with the highly acclaimed EP Under the Knife in 1996, and the following year released Satisfaction is the Death of Desire on Victory Records, then the home of some of the biggest bands in metalcore. Satisfaction sold more copies than any other debut in the history of the record company.

&gt; A constant touring schedule pushed them beyond the boundaries of the hardcore punk scene, and tours with national metal bands such as Slayer, Deftones, Entombed and Napalm Death brought them to the attention of many non-hardcore/metalcore fans. These influences were apparent on the band's next two releases, 2002's Perseverance, and especially 2003's The Rise of Brutality.

&gt; After the release of The Rise of Brutality, the band took part in the 2004 Unholy Alliance tour in Europe with Slayer, Slipknot and Mastodon. In June, 2006, Hatebreed went on an extensive European tour which included a performance at the Download Festival in Donnington, UK. Immediately following this European tour, they played the main stage at Ozzfest 2006 alongside DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed, and co-headliners System of a Down.

&gt; The band's next album, Supremacy, was released in August, 2006, their first through Roadrunner Records, featuring new guitarist Frank Novinec (who had previously spent time playing with Ringworm, Terror, and Integrity). Jasta described it as an ""all-out onslaught of completely adrenaline-charged, in-your-face brutality"".

&gt; Hatebreed still maintains tight connections to the hardcore community, evidenced by the lineup for the their 10 year anniversary show at Toad's Place on November 25 and November 26, 2005 in New Haven: Neglect, One 4 One, Irate, and reunions by All Out War and Skarhead.

&gt; On September 13, 2006, former guitarist Lou ""Boulder"" Richards committed suicide at the age of 35. Richards played on 1997's Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire and 2002's Perseverance before leaving the band later that year. Jasta issued the following statement regarding Richards' passing:
“ As many of you may have heard, and we were sorry to learn, our former guitar player Lou ""Boulder"" Richards passed away yesterday. It is very unfortunate that he could not see any other way to conquer his demons. We hope he has finally found some peace. Our hearts go out to Vera and his family and friends. ”

&gt; Hatebreed headlined the second stage on the 2007 Ozzfest tour.

&gt; Jamey Jasta confirmed that Hatebreed is working on a new album in an interview shown during the Headbanger's Ball.

&gt; Hatebreed also released a concert DVD titled ""Live Dominance"" on September 2, 2008, The next Hatebreed album ""For the Lions""  was an cover album. Artists covered will include Metallica, D.R.I., Crowbar, and the Cro-Mags.

&gt; Hatebreed appeared at Wacken Open Air festival in 2008 alongside Iron Maiden, Children of Bodom, and Avantasia.

&gt; In April 2008, Hatebreed signed a worldwide deal with Koch Records for the release of their live DVD, a live album, and a cover album entitled ""For The Lions"" releasing May 5.

&gt; February 9, 2009 Guitarist Sean Martin quit the band. Jamey Jasta said the following, ""I speak on behalf of all of us and we support Sean's decision to leave and want him to be happy and successful at everything he does. There are no bad feelings at all and you'll probably see him hanging on stage at some of our local shows. We're family and he will be missed but Hatebreed will forge on."" Sean Martin added, ""After 10 years, I've decided to leave Hatebreed. This in no way reflects my personal relationship with Jamey, Chris, Matt and Frank; they're four of my closest friends and I'll always love them with all my heart. I want to thank all of the fans as well as the guys in the band and crew, past and present, for giving me some of the best times of my life.""

The whole concept of ""indigineous peoples"" being applied in Europe is a quite weird too. Are all Europeans not native to Europe?

It is true, however, that the Sami were treated quite badly historically. Their culture was looked down upon, and their language and religion was oppressed after the areas where Sami traditionally live were annexed into the Nordic countries. I am sure one can find dozens of European examples of smaller culture groups being oppressed by a larger culture group annexing their land and forcefully joining them into the larger group.

jtbc,poppy,Lest We Forget,"Trudeau's multiculturalism explicitly addressed the new Canadians that had arrived since the second world war, and was in part a response to separatism in Quebec. The immigration system had already been deracinated and ramped up by Diefenbaker and Pearson.

If you start from the point of a tri-national (more than 3, but whatever) situation around confederation, there have been waves of diversity since then. There were noticeable chinese and japanese minorities on the west coast by the end of the century, and millions of south and eastern europeans were added in the first few decades of the 20th. Every wave was accompanied by cries of how this would destroy Canada by the influx of people that ate, dressed, and talked differently than the locals, with the definition of ""locals"" expanding over time (but excluding the asians until much later, on explicitly racist lines).

So while it is true that multiculturalism as we understand it started with Trudeau, and didn't really become visible until Mulroney/Chretien, the history of the country has been one of gradually increasing the cultural diversity, with different definitions of who could and couldn't participate and occasional retrenchment.

Whether this is good or bad can be debated. In my opinion, ethnic nationalism was an incredibly destructive force last century, so I am willing to give multiculturalism a go as an alternate.

None of that ensures I know what I'm talking about ;) but I'm skeptical of your specific critiques. 

DNC and RNC are both firmly neoliberal, especially after Reagan. It's true that they exist in a spectrum, and are not identical in any way, but they're on the same region of the broader economic spectrum. The US does not have viable representation when it comes to New Deal style liberalism, let alone democratic socialism, or anything remotely resembling Irish/German/French socialism. So there is no alternative to neoliberal economic policy. None. Zilch. 

On social issues, DNC and GOP are obviously wildly different. We fixate on those dividing lines, while accepting the monopoly of a single economic philosophy; one with rather nasty long-term consequences if you're in the bottom 80% of wage earners.

Compared to most of Europe, there's no diversity at all. There's an economic line that cannot be crossed. A two party democracy is not a democracy at all, it's just theater to distract the public from more fundamental economic questions. It becomes more apparent during elections when the ""if you don't vote for X or Y, you're wasting your vote and hurting everyone else"" rhetoric comes out.

Atypicalclone,,,"Suomessa on ollut tempoileva vallanjako, missä valtio on siirtänyt tiettyjä velvoitteita kunnille. Kunnat taas eivät ole osanneet järjestää asioitaan riitelemättä keskenään ja valtionosuusjärjestelmä on muuttunut useita kertoja parinkymmenen vuoden aikana. Sotessa kuntien suurin kuluerä - sosiaali- ja terveyspalvelut - siirtyvät maakuntien järjestettäväksi. 

Nuo mainitsemasi ratkaisut kuten lakkauspäätökset kuulostavat siltä että ne on tehty suuren kunnan päättävissä elimissä. En tiedä kuuluuko Kiuruvesi nykyään Kuopioon, oletan että kuuluu? Tällöin lopetusratkaisu on tehty Kuopion kaupunginvaltuustossa. Tämä päättäjien etäisyys päätettävien asioista ei ratkea maakuntien myötä. Päinvastoin, Kuopion päättäjien sijaan Kiuruveden asioista tulee päättämään sotejutuissa koko Pohjois-Savon maakuntahallinto. 

Pienten kuntien kannalta tämä voi olla huono asia koska päätöksenteko etääntyy lisää. Kaupunkien kannalta tämä on huono asia, koska ne joutuvat syrjäseutujen maksumiehiksi kahteen kerta. Ensinnäkin niiden valtionosuudet tukevat jo muutenkin syrjäseutuja, sitten niiltä viedään maakuntatasolla lisää rahaa ja päätäntävaltaa toisaalle. Taho joka tästä hyötyy ovat ne, jotka pääsevät pyörittämään itse maakuntaorganisaatiota eli kepu. 

Puhumattakaan tietysti siitä että maakuntaherrat pääsevät sitten päättämään minkä firman laariin he verorahoja kaatavat ja voi vaan kuvitella millaista paikalliskorruptiota siitä seuraa. Kittilä on steroids. 

Susi tästä varmaan on siis tulossa, eikä paranna kaipaamiasi asioita. Se mitä Suomessa kaivattaisiin olisi yhteistyötä eikä nurkkapatrioottisuutta. Tämähän mättää suuremmalla tasolla kuin vain pikkukylistä puhuessa, esimerkiksi länsimetron perseilyt taisivat johtua Espoon ja Helsingin riitelystä. Olisi tarvinnut jonkun tahon polkemaan jalkaa ja pakottamaan lapset leikkimään kiltisti jos eivät keskenään osaa. Maakuntahallinnot varmaan retuuttavat kuntia jatkossa, mutta kuka niiden välisiä tappeluja kaitsee? Puhumattakaan siitä että maakuntapäättäjät tulevat olemaan entisiä kuntapäättäjiä, jotka tuovat vanhat kaunat ja eturistiriidat mukanaan. 

EU on jännä maininta, koska briteissähän kaikesta omien poliitikkojen perseilystä syytettiin EU:ta mikä johti sitten Brexitiin. Samaa on tehty myös Suomessa, esimerkiksi hallintarekisteri ajettiin läpi EU:lla perustelemalla (valheellisesti!). En ihmettelisi vaikka sitten kun yksityistetyn terveydenhuoltojärjestelmän kuseminen paljastuu, siitä syytetään EU:ta koska ei osata kantaa vastuuta omista päätöksistä.

The first emergency restrictions on immigration (not including the Chinese Exclusion Act) were because of Italian Anarchists and their bombings in 1918-1919.

So that's wrong.

Also supposes equal desire to emigrate from their home country across every country.

Mr_Manag3r,pc,,"Hi, thanks so much for your response. I really want to emphasize that **any** feedback is golden, so this is very appreciated. Answers to your questions below!

&amp;nbsp;

**Regarding high latency players on servers**

Yes, I only use the server browser, I'm only referring to how my local servers (Frankfurt and Ireland, EU are the closest to me) are populated. [This is a screenshot I took a week or so ago during late night/early morning playing, for reference](https://imgur.com/yKvoxQu). I've read (but not experienced, mind you) on the BF1 reddit that many are joined to out of region servers even during prime time. Mainly from the US from what I've seen mentioned. Not verified though since I only use the browser myself apart from always seeing at least one or two 100+ latency players whenever I play. As I mentioned, the problem is massive during off-hours but manageable during peak hours.

&amp;nbsp;

**Regarding team balance** 

Both. A start would be to at least ensure that player counts are roughly even between teams and that it stays that way during the match (adding new joiners to the team with the player deficit etc). After that the skill value. I know there were discussions about this during the BF4 CTE and from what I recall neither the Devs nor the community could really come up with a value that would be all that much better than what we have now. It's been a while so my memory is fuzzy on the details. I feel since it's likely a big undertaking and would require lots of testing that it's a good idea to start work on that sooner rather than later.

New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"I'm surprised about how well Christopher Clark speaks German. I hope they will in produce foreign language versions of this series.

Here is a DeepL translation of the introduction:

The European saga (1/6)
What is Europe? How did this continent come into being, which - geographically speaking - is not a continent at all? What holds it together with its many states and peoples? Is there ""typically European""? How has Europe shaped our thinking and enriched the world?

These are questions that interest Australian-born Christopher Clark on his journey through the culture and history of Europe. The renowned Cambridge historian is like no other, able to cast an entertaining and knowledgeable look at our continent - both from within and outside. In his presentations in the most beautiful and symbolic places in Europe, he brings order to the so confusingly diverse history of our continent.

Where does Europe begin - where does it end?

Geography does not take us very far in defining geography: in the north, south and west of the sea, the continent loses itself in the east somewhere in the Urals. Strictly speaking, it is not a continent at all, but an appendage of Asia, a peninsula on the edge of the ""Eurasian land mass"". ""Europe is not a place, but an idea,""as French philosopher and journalist Bernard-Henri Lévy once put it. In contrast to all other continents, the continent is defined less by its natural boundaries than by common history and culture. This is an essential question: Where are the origins?

First of all, Europe is a landmass which, at first glance, is different from other continents: it is small in size, fragmented, rich in coasts compared to its size and, for the most part, located in a temperate climate zone. Europe's geography has shaped its history. This begins with the - in a biological sense - first modern people,""migrants"", who came from Africa and settled further north. Later, as in the Orient, for example, the first city-states and cultures such as those of the Celts emerged in Europe. The Romans created a multi-ethnic empire that extended to ever larger areas of the continent. A single law, common currency, economy and culture strengthened cohesion. The connection with Christianity - as a state religion - gave the continent a foundation that united power, faith and orientation.

The creation myth

The story begins with the much-cited myth of its origins: Zeus' love for a princess named Europa, whom he abducted to the continent, which was later named after her - probably a symbol of the influence of the Orient on the Occident. Future cultures not only replaced each other, they took up the achievements of their predecessors until the maps were remixed by the migration of peoples and finally merged Greek, Roman, Celtic, Germanic, heathen and above all Christianity. While Europe had been born in the Mediterranean cultures of the ancient world, the Germanic tribes in the northwest developed into the clocks of the continent, on the threshold to the occident.

&gt;EDIT: I messed up. The SD mansion crew is not Japanese.

A ton of characters migrated to Gensokyo and aren't Japanese. Gensokyo is a place for spirits and monsters from all corners of the world.

In addition to Alice, Remilia, Flandre, Patchouli and the unnamed devil in the library you have a whole slew of Western characters.

Like fairies are not a Japanese thing and all of them that have canon names are in English. Sunny Milk, Star, Sapphire, Luna Child, Eternity Larva, Lily White, Chir(Chill)no. Since if I remember right fairies are the most populous resident this makes a fair bit of Gensokyo Western actually.

Rumia is Western according to ZUN. Her name Rumia is not actually a normal Japanese name and is most likely a miss-translation of Lumia.

The Prismriver Sisters, Lyrica, Lunasa and Merlin Prismriver are clearly European Poltergeists.

The Hobgoblins that work at the Scarlet Devil Mansion are from Europe.

Parsee is most likely Persian in origin, Mizuhashi is probably an adopted name, it literally means Bridge-water. Nazrin as well I believe has Persian  origins.

Maribel Hearn is hinted at being Greek in origin by way of her name, her name is based off of Lafcadio Hearn/Koizumi Yakumo a immigrant and famous writer of ghost stories.

Also Greek is the god Hecatia and her Lampad servant Clownpiece.

Then there are those with Western names like Wriggle Nightbug, Mystia Lorelei, Letty Whiterock and Doremy(Dreamy) Sweet who are probably Japanese but likely changed their names at some point due to all the Western influences in Gensokyo. Medicine Melancholy is a Western style doll but no way to tell where her former owner is from.

This is before we even get into the characters with hinted or outright stated Chinese origins.

WikiTextBot,,,"**English landscape garden**

The English landscape garden, also called English landscape park or simply the English garden (French: Jardin à l'anglaise, Italian: Giardino all'inglese, German: Englischer Landschaftsgarten, Portuguese: Jardim inglês, Spanish: Jardín inglés), is a style of ""landscape"" garden which emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical jardin à la française of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, and, in the Anglo-Chinese garden, from the classic Chinese gardens of the East, which had recently been described by European travellers. The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.

TheBassCave,,,"I know that our better results recently have generally come when we've played 3 at the back, but I really hope that we don't fall into that trap here. Earlier in the season, Hoffenheim and Arsenal played 3-4-3 against Liverpool and both of them were massacred out wide. I'm having nightmares about Mo Salah running at our outside CBs.

Since Mané's been out, they had been playing Coutinho wide left but he was injured for the Huddersfield match, so they played Firmino out there with Sturridge through the middle. Those two offer a different threat to Mané but they're equally dangerous and will definitely hurt us in those areas. Oxlade-Chamberlain started on the left against Maribor tonight, which I guess suggests that Sturridge will start at the weekend? AOC would do quite well against us so I wouldn't be surprised to see him start.

Liverpool haven't been pressing quite as high as they were last season - presumably because they've got to play in Europe and their playing style is knackering - but due to the lack of pace in our defence/ their uncertainty in possession, they could easily wreak havoc against us if they revert to properly smothering us. 

Playing like that necessitates having a high defensive line and Spurs did a good job of exploiting that by letting Liverpool advance into their half, winning the ball deep in their own third, then launching long, direct passes over the top for Kane and Son to chase. Antonio's the only player we have who can do that (and he's got some making up to do), so getting him high up the pitch would be beneficial. This is also the sort of game where we should probably be using Andy Carroll; at least if he's playing, we can go long to bypass the press and if our defenders are panicking on the ball, they've (theoretically) got an outlet. Liverpool have struggled most this season when they've dominated possession and had to break down deep-lying teams, so surrendering the ball to them isn't exactly a problem. I don't think AC is a particularly good target man, but all of Liverpool's central defenders are horrible in the air so we should make the most of that. Plus, I think they're the only team who defend set pieces worse than we do, so it's worth including Carroll just for that.

{Shisha no Teikoku} - Victorian era England where reanimation of dead humans has become common, however they have not managed to revive the ""soul"" of a human. Focuses on a student trying to do so.

**American Clean Energy and Security Act**

The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES) was an energy bill in the 111th United States Congress (H.R. 2454) that would have established a variant of an emissions trading plan similar to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. The bill was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009 by a vote of 219-212, but was never brought to the floor of the Senate for discussion or a vote.

The House passage of the bill was the ""first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change.""

The bill was also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill, after its authors, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats. Waxman was at the time the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Markey was the chairman of that committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee.

majesticjg,,,"It seems like all the really big announcements about charging are Europe only, which is funny considering the whole continent is smaller than the continental US. 

Here are the issues as I see them:

- Speed. Putting in a J1772 or even a 50kw CCS isn't going to cut it with bigger and bigger batteries coming to EVs.  Tesla has 120kw and I expect more from Tesla and everybody else soon.

- Plugs. Just putting in one fast charging connector is miserable. As a driver, I don't know if that guy's 10% charged or 90% charged, and I don't know if he's ever coming back. If that plug is taken, I have to go find another one. Most of the DC fast chargers near me have one fast charging plug. I can't plan around that. The only places [I can find fast charging
](https://na.chargepoint.com/charge_point) are miserably located and have, at most, 2 DC combo plugs. 

- Convenience for road trippers. Putting a charger in a downtown parking garage doesn't actually help me. I don't need or want to go far from major roads to plug in, then fight traffic again on my way out. The problem with letting local businesses (or local governments) decide where the chargers go is that they put it where it's convenient for them, not for the me. I want them in service plazas on the highway or, at most, a mile from the highway where food and restrooms are available. 

Any article that talks about how many Level 2 chargers they're going to install is just noise to me. I have 17kw charging at home.

&gt;The thing is - it didn't, or it didn't enough. Because as I stated before, not one of us were rich enough to lift up the poorer, or: Germany can do that for Poland, but Slovenia can't do that for Bosnia. Scale of problems matters a lot.

I'm not advising a pseudo-federation as a wealth redistribution platform, since the EU does that job already. I advise it as a wealth management platform of EU funds as well as negotiated member funds for things like cross border highways, dams, and national parks. The stuff that is usually done bilaterally, but never very well and not often enough. 

&gt;It turned out that our interests and viewpoints are too far from each other... so, what's the point of trying a third time?

Welcome to Europe, where we all killed each other more often than not.

The issue is that we're so closely tied in together that it's just as easy to fight for a share of the same resources as to work together to make those resources increase. Brothers are natural competitors as well allies, members of the same species fight for the same niche, it's an natural rule that permeates everything.

West balkan nations have found themselves falling for competitive behavior in the past. But so what? We know that it leads to: nothing good. The people who wrote the SANU memorandum were wrong, myopic, and moronic. Why not undo the mistake? Or at least admit it was a mistake, and hope by agreeing everyone can move forward in peace if not in unity.

&gt;**Governador do RJ assinou documento judicial questionando o ministro sobre acusações feitas contra a segurança pública do estado. Ação já foi remetida ao Supremo Tribunal Federal.**  


&gt; O governador do Rio de Janeiro, Luiz Fernando Pezão, questionou judicialmente o ministro da Justiça, Torquato Jardim, sobre as acusações feitas por ele contra a segurança pública do estado. O presidente da Casa, deputado federal Rodrigo Maia, que é do Rio de Janeiro, disse em entrevista à jornalista Andréia Sadi que está ""perplexo"" e aguarda ""provas"" do ministro. Segundo Picciani, titular da pasta dos Esportes, se o ministro da Justiça tem alguma prova do que disse, deveria determinar à Polícia Federal a abertura imediata de inquérito sobre os fatos. Roberto Sá: Pezão é solidário à Polícia Militar Na tarde desta quarta, o governo do Rio reuniu oficiais no Palácio Guanabara, sede do poder executivo estadual, para discutir as declarações do ministro. A nomeação de Wolney também foi questionada pelo ministro Jardim, segundo quem causa estranheza o fato de a Secretaria de Segurança Pública não ter um só oficial da ativa capaz de assumir o comando da PM. ""Conheço o coronel [Wolney] Dias há 34 anos, tem uma carreira ilibada e está totalmente alinhado com minhas diretrizes"", afirmou o secretário sobre o oficial escolhido pelo governador para ser comandante-geral da PM. Além disso, Sá reforçou que o ex-comandante do 3º BPM (Méier) coronel Gustavo Teixeira, baleado e morto no bairro, foi assassinado durante um roubo, conforme apontam as investigações da Divisão de Homicídios.

Kesuke,,,"The problem with using this for political point scoring is that it might not play out quite the way labour are hoping. 

Firstly, these reports were written at different times with different agendas in mind. The pre-referrendum reports were essentially designed to produce facts and figures that would back the Cameron/Osborne governments position, which was of course to remain in the EU. As a result they are likely to be melodramatically pro-Remain. However, since the EU referendum the reports have been aimed at assessing potential risks and opportunities - both economic and political. As a result there is likely to be a broad range of information in these reports, some of it will be scathingly-anti-Brexit and other aspects might actually be scathingly anti-EU.

Secondly, the problem for Labour is that whatever the flavour of these reports, they will point out what we already know - that leaving the EU is a significant *""unknown""* that carries risks... but labour still back leaving the EU. Indeed the Conservative and Labour policy with regards to Brexit is practically identical. There is hardly any material difference between them. May wants to leave the EU, Corbyn wants to leave the EU. May wants the ECJ out of the UK, Corbyn wants the ECJ out of the UK. May wants EU citizens to have the right to remain, Corbyn wants EU citizens to have the right to remain, May doesn't want a physical border in NI, Corbyn doesn't want a physical border in NI etc. 

So, it seems to me that forcing the government to release documents that demonstrate that what is effectively a shared policy is significantly risky might not actually end up being such a slick move. It is going to galvanize bremoaners in the Labour party and increase calls for the party to abandon Brexit or at least offer a mechanism to do it (such as a second referendum). This could actually end up being more divisive for Labour than it is for the conservatives.

""Nobody says this"" people most certainly try to use colonial Europe to pretend whites are superior. Denying it just makes you look obstinate and not willing to actually discuss anything. Maybe you don't think that but saying nobody is super disingenuous.

hellafun,grendelprime,Grendel Prime,"Hey, one last thing I was hoping you could clear up. I have been doing some research into publishing since, as you said:

&gt;but then you don't even know how publishing works,

I mean I thought I knew, but I didn’t realize I was talking to the genius of all publishing. Once I realized that is in fact who you are I went and did some research because I didn't want to sound dumb when talking to someone who really knows their stuff. I was hoping you could clear up some confusion for me though. You made it VERY CLEAR (like you wrote three whole paragraphs on the subject) that publishers never, ever, ever ever publish directly in markets that are not their home country. The only way publishing is done, as per the genius of all publishing, is by licensing properties out. That isn’t something done just because of the size of the market or the size of the company, no, as per you it is the only true way that things are published in countries outside their country of origin, with the SOLE exception of Viz.

The problem is, as I began researching… well, I think I need you to clear something up, because as it stands it seems like you might be pretty entirely wrong. But you were so sure of what you said that I know that cannot be the case, so can you clear up the following?

Kodansha, one of the largest manga publishers, publishes directly in the US as Kodansha USA. Kadokawa is majority owner of Yen Press, their western publishing arm (co-created with Hachette Book Group). Animate Ltd. although a smaller firm, does the exact same as Kodansha. Then from Europe, there is the popular French publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés who publish their own books here in the US as Humanoids Publishing. The British publisher Titan Books recently began publishing their comics directly for the US market as Titan Comics. And, although they don’t exist anymore, even back in the 1980s when the British publisher behind 2000AD wanted to bring Judge Dredd, etc. to the US, they started up Eagle Comics expressly for that purpose.

So, what gives? From what you said none of these publishers should exist because no one does business this way, right? What went wrong that all these companies did things this way? Do you think it could be because the market was big enough that it made more sense than simply licensing the work to a local publisher? Is that possible? If not, what is the logical explanation?

Anyhow, thanks in advance for your answers and help in getting me to understand how publishing works, something I clearly know nothing about and you, well; you're like the library of Alexandria when it comes to such knowledge.

&gt; Culture Club was a popular 1980s pop group, perhaps most noticeable for their gender-bending frontman Boy George. The other members of the band were Roy Hay on guitars and keyboards, Mikey Craig playing bass and Jon Moss (ex Damned, London, Adam and the Ants) on drums.

&gt; Their first album, 1982's Kissing to Be Clever, became a major international hit, spawning the hit singles ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"" (which went 'all the way' in the BBC-Charts in late 1982), ""Time (Clock of the Heart)"", and ""I'll Tumble 4 Ya"". Unique in his eccentric manner of dress and androgynous look, Boy George became a worldwide celebrity.

&gt; Their second album, 1983's Colour By Numbers also did extremely well, giving the band its second number one hit in the UK with ""Karma Chameleon."" Karma Chameleon reached No.1 in many countries and they even starred in UK's Top of the Pops in September 1983. However, trouble was brewing within the Culture Club camp. Unknown to the public, George was having an affair with drummer Jon Moss. The affair (which lasted over four years) was often problematic and the pressure to hide the relationship started to take its toll.

&gt; The band also started to lose its place musically. Their next album, 1984's Waking Up With the House on Fire was a major disappointment. Though the band gained a small comeback with 1986's From Luxury to Heartache (thanks to the hit ""Move Away""), both George's and Jon's fights created much tension, eventually leading to the breakup of the band. Around this time, George also became addicted to heroin, which created a frenzy with the tabloids. Eventually, George would let go of the habit and begin his solo career. A minor hit from the ""Hiding Out"" soundtrack called ""Live My Life"" peaked at U.S. #40. While George scored several hits in Europe and finally hit the U.S. top 20 with 1992's ""The Crying Game"", he was never able to reach the success he achieved with Culture Club.

&gt; In 1998, the band put their issues aside and decided to do a reunion tour. Kicked off with a performance on VH1 Storytellers, the tour was a major success. Shortly after, Culture Club recorded a new album titled Don't Mind If I Do. Though never released in the U.S., the first single, ""I Just Wanna Be Loved"" (UK #4), was featured on a compilation based around the Storytellers performance.

&gt; The band went on to tour for a few more years. Recently, however, Culture Club has been inactive, largely due to Boy George's concentration on his successful career as a DJ. In late 2006, Culture Club announced a reunion - albeit, without Boy George as lead singer. Read more on Last.fm.

For the record what people forget is native americans were largely hunter gatherer tribes and isolated settlements. The COUNTRY concept was BUILT by european settlers who aimed to settle lands and live side by side with the natives.

Much like Russia was BUILT by Russians but also incorporated the small bands of siberians and other groups to have rights inside that country.

Or how Japan was settled by Japanese who buily Japan and extended rights to native Ainu/Okinawans.

Its standard country settling behavior. There are mistames made along the way obviously but it has nothing in common with purely genocidal **destructive** mass migration which by definition requires a group to be attacked and victimized (whereas attacks/victimization were an undesirable side effect of past settlements)

&gt; Manu Chao (⋆ 21 June 1961 in Paris, France) is a French/Spanish rock, reggae, punk and ska artist; well-known in the Paris alternative music scene before his international success with the band Mano Negra (active 1988-95). Well-known songs are 'Me Gustas Tu', 'Bongo Bong', 'Clandestino', 'Mr Bobby', and 'Je Ne'taime Plus'. Manu is one of the world's largest selling artists, but is less known in the English-speaking world. Much of his lyrics are about global political and social issues, but also about love, world's lifestyles, and music.

&gt; -  -  -

&gt; Manu Chao (born José-Manuel Thomas Arthur Chao on 21 June 1961 in Paris, France) is a singer of French and Spanish (Basque, Galician) origin.

&gt; Heavily influenced by the UK rock scene, particularly The Clash, The Jam and Dr. Feelgood, Chao and other musicians formed the Spanish/English rockabilly group Hot Pants in the mid-1980s. The group released a demo entitled ""Mala Vida"" in 1984, which received plenty of local critical praise but otherwise gained them little attention. By the time the group released their first album in 1986 the Parisian alternative music scene had taken flight, and Manu, his brother Antoine Chao, and friends such as Alain from Les Wampas formed Los Carayos to incorporate this sound with the rockabilly and punk styles of Hot Pants. Los Carayos remained a side project of the artists for eight years, releasing three albums in the first two years followed by a final album in 1994.

&gt; Manu Chao had been a well-known member of the Parisian alternative music scene, in bands such as Hot Pants and Los Carayos. In 1987, Chao, his brother Antoine Chao and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the band Mano Negra, which met with success in France first with the hit single Mala Vida and then Mexico, Central and South America, where the band toured. The band split in 1995.

&gt; Chao sings in French, Spanish, Arabic, Galician, Portuguese, English, Italian, and Wolof, sometimes mixing them in the same song. He is one of the world's largest selling artists, but is less known in the English-speaking world.

&gt; Chao's music has many influences: rock, French chanson, Spanish-American Salsa, Reggae, Ska and Algerian rai. These influences were obtained from immigrants in France, his Iberian roots and his travels in Latin America following the disbanding of Mano Negra. Many of Chao's lyrics are about political issues (e.g., immigration, global social justice, conflict, and a strongly leftist critique of exploitative economic globalization) but they are also about love, lifestyles in different parts of the world, and music itself, which is hopeful for the future and at the same time dramatic. Chao is openly critical of the Bush administration in the US. He has many followers among the European left and the anti-globalization movement.

&gt; The influence of Manu Chao in Latin Rock or ""Rock en Español"" was crucial not only for the development and rise of new Latin bands that tried to emulate his eclectic style, but also for the self-knowledge of Latin America as a united culture.  After the Latin America tour and travels, Manu Chao lyrics were more often written in Spanish than were the Mano Negra lyrics. His songs also took the lyrics or chords of some popular tunes like ""El preso"" from ""Fruko y Sus Tesos"" (in ""Desaparecido"") or ""La Verdolaga"" a traditional Colombian cumbia (in ""Por el Suelo"").

&gt; Manu Chao's music does not follow a logical textual narrative, but in its eclectic construction it invokes a deeper understanding of its subject than any literal form could. He sings songs about the people of the streets, the outer provinces, and the marginalised; he sings with the forgotten and uncounted billions, the underclass, and in so doing, he speaks about the fragility of human kind.

SpaceWolf35,,,"Well I’m not looking for some kind of nirvana fallacy here, of course having a distinct set of values and norms also means some people within your group will also become outcasts, not just foreigners. Personally I’m totally fine with that, though. The good of the many, and whatnot.

As for the US or Canada, I’d say that’s debatable given that our countries were founded on pretty distinct ideals and while its technically true that we’ve always been diverse, that diversity was largely restricted to similar Western European countries where many similar histories and values were already shared, making assimilation and integration easier.

But I think the bigger issue is that many places in Europe, countries that, like Japan, actually do have very distinct ethnicities and histories and cultures, are adopting many of the same belief systems that we are in our countries.

So, even if I accepted the idea that Canada or the USA can never have a distinct identity, that argument doesn’t apply to Europe.

I also personally reject the notion of adhering to just the constitution or laws, a sort of “civic nationalism” as some people call it, as forming the identity.

ArcienMusic,kanra,,"European here.

From my experience:

- In exhibition, it's fairly easy to find an opponent, even if you limit your search. It's also possible to find opponents in ranked, but it /can/ take some time because of the small playerbase on Steam.

- Netplay is fantastic. Other than one match (most likely because of lag and not the netcode) I've had no trouble whatsoever. You might experience graphical lag though, but I've found this to seem cosmetic only. For example, when an opponent ducks, you don't see the entire animation, BUT, you see the instant the ducking is active. Some other animations will also seem weird, like Sabrewulf's Eclipse or Kan-Ra's sand punt.

- The game is well worth it, even excluding multiplayer. The benefit of the Steam version - in contrast to the Xbox version - is that you don't have to be online to play it. The game has a fantastic training/dojo mode, which teaches you the game from it's basics, like jumping and general movement, to attacking, to combo breaking, to combo breaking combo breakers (counter breakers), to more advanced stuff. It's really easy on you, even if you're not into fighting games.

- I'm not sure about this as I don't have a fight stick, but through Steam, both my PS4 and an Xbox 360 controller was supported instantly without any additional configuration. I just plugged them in and it worked. Since KI supports some fightsticks, I'm gonna assume it works likewise, but don't hang me up on it.",True,0,1509575516,,False,0,dp7mwh2,False,t3_79zh31,t3_79zh31,/r/killerinstinct/comments/79zh31/regarding_ki_steam_europe/dp7mwh2/,1512030728,2.0,False,killerinstinct,t5_2sqy5,public,

WikiTextBot,,,"**General Data Protection Regulation**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a regulation by which the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the data protection directive (officially Directive 95/46/EC) of 1995. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.

xdeadzx,raider,"Raider, LEGENDARY!","tl:dr matchmaking is super hard, yo.

&gt;Indeed but don't they always say ""it isn't that small""? 

Thing is for full skill based matchmaking with good queue times (sub 1.5 minutes) in a 5v5 game you need a player count of 100k concurrent players, and that just covers the two major zones (NA/EU)  I'm using 5v5 because it's what the study entailed, I realize For Honor is 4v4 at it's largest.  But 3v3 Awesomenauts found very similar results to 5v5.
___
To make that skill based matchmaking work with 50k players, you have to triple the queue times resulting in 4.5 minute queues.  Drop that to 20k players and you go up to 6 minute queues.

No one thinks 20k concurrent players is small (it's like top 20 on steam or something, top 40 for sure) but everyone thinks a 6 minute queue time is way too long.  So you loosen skill rating a bit to lower queue times, and it works.  But then you also lose balancing between players...  

Now even a 5k concurrent population is fairly decent, even if it's not a headliner it still makes the top 100 on steam.  A 5k concurrent population will usually be around ~100k-300k players total depending on the game, and Ubi has told us they have ~1.3m unique players active (usually means plays once a week) across all three platforms.

Example for reference, DOTA2 sees 10m uniques every 2 weeks, and goes between 700k and 300k concurrents depending on time of day.  A much larger community on a single platform than For Honor.  And people still bitch about matchmaking there too.  :)

___
So I wouldn't say it's a small community, but it's not large enough to get a stable, skill based match making split between 3 platforms either.

That's just some information from within the industry, something I've been told and taught by a few different people.

bestem,california text,California,"I'm not anywhere near a first-generation American.  My heritage is roughly 50% German, 25% Irish, 25% European Mutt.  My mother knew a smattering of German from when she took it in high school, but not much.  My dad didn't know any.  I grew up in San Diego, in a community where you didn't need to know English to get a job, but you did need to know Spanish and one Asian dialect.  They offered Spanish and French in my high school, I took Spanish because it made sense.

Three cousins on my dad's side of the family, closer to 70% German (their mother was more German than my mother), who grew up in Michigan, didn't learn German as children, but took German in high school, and well into college.  There wasn't a pressing need for a specific language based on what was around them, so they chose the one they identified with the most.  When they were in high school, I visited at some point, and the oldest one had a German accent.  The three of them when talking to each other, would only speak in German (for immersion purposes).  They all ended up much more fluent in German than I ever was in Spanish.

Many of my friends and classmates in San Diego, spoke their parents mother-tongues.  With over 48% of the residents being people who were born in other countries, you can see why that might be so.  When one of the kids I nannied for got an award one year in middle school, they were also giving out awards to the ESL kids.  There were kids who came to the school knowing very little English, but an awful lot of 1 or 2 of 38 different languages, who had learned English in school.  The church my dad attends has weekly Mass in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, but also special multicultural Masses, where they say different parts of the Mass in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean, Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian.  At the local branch library, 25% of the library is taken up with books in various Asian dialects.  At the grocery store's closest to my dad's house, they don't bother labeling everything in English, which doesn't matter much for apples, but does for fish.  Now that my classmates and friends are adults, and have children of their own, the kids learn the language their grandparents speak, as well as English, or they wouldn't be able to talk with Grandma and Grandpa.  Besides, things like shopping, and going to restaurants within the community, etc, are easier when they know the language of their grandparents, not just English.  And, it makes it easy for them to keep secrets from their classmates, by switching over to speaking Laotian or Tagalog, or whatever.",True,0,1509578464,,False,0,dp7pfvp,False,t3_7a5m9w,t3_7a5m9w,/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/7a5m9w/how_common_is_it_for_americans_to_speak_the/dp7pfvp/,1512032012,2.0,False,AskAnAmerican,t5_2uah7,public,

XenoTechnian,,,"to start off let’s just get rid of that Ad Hominem,  and by the way, I accept your apology. I am neither rich, nor ignorant nor Russian, my family is about as middle class as you can possibly get, I am always doing my best to stay informed on as many things as i can and I’ve been a US citizen from the day I was born.

Now as for the president let’s start from the top of your post, to say someone is “the worst president ever” when they haven’t even served a full year is an awfully big assumption to be making, on top of this to say that “that’s just not up for debate” is just plane false, as that’s what we’re debating right now, after all virtually anything is up for debate and most especially politics.

After that you state that the president was “chosen as a wrecking ball” and that “only people who want total chaos and anarchy without any form of compassion for the middle or low classes support this guy” these are, respectively, a bushel metaphor that could be interpreted any number of ways, and another assumption. Starting with the metaphor, I hope you don’t mind me hazarding a guess that you mean to say he destroys things recklessly, and if that’s not I’m sorry in advance, but so far he hasn’t “destroyed” anything in the US government, save maybe cutting some funding to planned parenthood although to call that destruction might be stretching it. From what I’ve seen so far I’d argue that he’s actually done quite the opposite, approving the completion of the keystone pipeline, deregulating, and thus revitalizing the American coal industry, strengthened relations with close allies such as japan, South Korea, Israel, and many European nations, enforcing sanctions on Russia and North Korea, beneficial trade deal with China, which both eased tension in the South China Sea, and removed the only nation that might have considers intervening if conflict broke out with North Korea.

Now about that chaos and anarchy part, I’m actually just a tad confused as to we’re your getting that, considering his platform was largely marketed towards the middle class, and in his actual time as president as put large amounts of effort to releasing the disasters in California, Florida, and Puerto Rico, as well as making speeches condemning the violence of Charlottesville and the Las Vegas shootings, as well as calling for unity in a time were we are so divided as a nation, stating on his twitter that “We must remember this truth: No matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are ALL AMERICANS FIRST”.

Looking at our two main rivals, Chelsea are going to sack Conte at some point this season, something that can be hastened if we beat them at Anfield at the end of this month and Arsenal will lose Ozil and Sanchez at the end of this season if they don't get UCL and from that point are looking at an extended stretch in Europa League wilderness if they aren't careful. 

I also think the manner of the defeats has made everyone lose their heads. Shipping 4 and 5 away is embarassing but losing to Spurs and City away isn't a disaster. I was genuinely angrier at Watford away than at the City game, tbh. We were shocking at Wembley last week but I'm not sure Spurs are definitively 4-1 better than us on our day. We've absolutely defiled them in some recent games and they've still finished comfortably above us. Newcastle away, freak equaliser, shit happens, St. James' Park is a tough place to go, ok point. Burnley at home Solanke hits the crossbar on 85', Dyche dogs out a good away performance, worth their point on the day.

Xandr0,,,"I just don't understand this way of thinking at all. These are 2 very different games, both casually and competitive wise, and both are really good games in their respective categories. OW fans who say ""OW is better than trash LoL"" are braindead apes, and it also goes the other way around. 

Honestly, it feels great to have both of this games. Whenever League gets fucked up by some terrible balance changes, I can just go to OW and play almost only OW for a month or two, to come back when League's balance becomes normal. Usually I get a little bit bored by OW at the end of that time, so it's pretty much a perfect balance between these 2 without getting burnt out from any of them. 

Overwatch is a new game that lacks heroes and had lots of balance issues around certain heroes in last months, but it definitely has the potential to improve over the course of an upcoming year. Blizzard just needs to do something against throwers, as a person who spent years in League's Platinum and then Diamond elo I embraced the toxicity and don't even notice that anymore both in LoL and OW, but trolls throwing themselves from Diamond to Bronze to make themselves feel better after shitting on some kids are annoying. 

Then again, League's troll detection system is also far from being perfect and there's way too much focus on banning flamers, who you can do something against, instead of these who actively ruin your chances to win a game. Also, we all know about EU servers problems in last month, since I'm playing OW I didn't have such situation. 

Just, stop this hate train towards OW (or towards League if you're on OW's side) and appreciate the good things in both games. Nobody tells you that you have to drop LoL entirely if you want to play OW, in fact, OW can even improve your League skills such as better shillshot accuracy, predicting enemy movements and faster reaction time.

Tap4alyft,centipede,CENTIPEDE!,"I think this is where the disconnect is. The left accuses the right of lacking reflection, this is something we on the right call projection, and it's blatantly apparent in conversation with a leftist. Leftists project their own biases and shortcomings onto others.

We don't want to stop legal migration, we want a big and beautiful door in the wall to let migrants into the country legally, we just want to put an end to illegal migration. The left refuses to even try to comprehend the difference. The lack of reflection into the consequences rampant, uncontrolled, and unvetted migration is abhorrent to those of us on the right (I wanted to say those of us who think before we form opinions, but I want to remain civil). 

We on the right think rationally first and then consider the emotional impact of the course of action we are considering. The right to own and use arms is a basic human right. For us, the discussion stops there for introspection. There is no room for registration or confiscation, we are beginning the discussion in a place where the left refuses to meet us. Children should be protected from being murdered. This is a basic tenant of humanity, there is no argument to be made or discussion to be had concerning that fact. When we attempt to discuss this with a leftist, the leftist wants to begin at ""when should it be okay to murder children?"". This is incomprehensible to us, it's not even in the realm of reasonableness. To suggest such a thing makes you a monster.

Meanwhile there are important national discussions that are not happening. We need to have a discussion about violence  and what is causing it and how we can address it. We need to have a discussion about Society abandoning strong family economic models. We should sit down and talk about how to develop a budget that allows the goals of society to be met without the inequality of inequitable taxation. It's not that we can't have a discussion, we certainly can, but we can't start that discussion in a place that we find morally repugnant. We believe that America needs dire correction to bring us back from the brink of social and economic implosion, we want to fix the problems but we can't get half the country to stop crying and come to the table and talk like rational human beings.

Have you ever read ""Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes"" by Tanim Ansary? It clearly communicates the problem with Islam in the modern world. There are real and fundamental differences between how we view the world and how someone who grew up in the Middle East views the world. It's not just cultural, the differences infuse every aspect of thought and practice in public life. This is different from someone who grew up in the United States, or South America, or Europe, etc. They believe that we, in a very real way, hijacked their allah-given destiny to rule the modern world. Islam is not just a religion, it is independent governmental system that uses religion as a means of force to control the population (and that isn't hyperbolic).

The problem is that most (the vast majority) of the left have already turned out the conversation and all the leftist mind has been doing for the last three and a half paragraphs is construct hastily prepared rebuttals to the reasonable points made with no regard to veracity. It's impossible to have an intelligent discussion with those who recuse themselves from rational thought at the first sign of emotional distress.

Unless Spaniards are saying, because you are Catalonian you don't get to vote in Spanish general election though we get to determine your political out come, it doesn't matter. See both people I cited, on what makes self-determination self-determination. 

Look here. Even if we go with this loosely defined 'ethnic groups' of Europe, which I disagree with on using linguistic 

&gt;One should not assume that just because there is agreement about what constitutes a people that no complications arise concerning the application of the right to self-determination: it is the ‘how’ not the ‘who’ of self-determination that is argued about, notably in two regards: (i) how is the people made up, and (ii) how does it exercise its right? These questions must be held apart from the way the right to self-determination is implemented after it has been exercised. (iii) Finally, the identification not only of the holder but also of the duty-bearer of **the right to self-determination is necessary.**

So someone really has to convince every country that matters that Catalonia deserves self-determination in spite of the fact that they have their own autonomous government, pretty good control of their own economy, and the fact that they do take part in general elections and have their voices represent in the parliament.

Poland on the other hand is the fastest developing economy in Europe, and is a first world country despite only being freed from communist occupation 27 years ago. Canada is declining, socially and economically, whereas Poland and Japan continue to rise. Show me some data that supports your ideas, because I don't buy your emotionally fueled arguments.

Prerogativ,s1 13 team-13 country-ita,AC Milan,"&gt; Ok I'll bite. I like highlight reels. It takes a tremendous amount of skill to do with these guys do, I dont think anyone downplays that. That being said, the highlight reels are a bunch of 20 second clips. The other 89 minutes are boring AF. At least IMO. You may not think it's boring and that's fine but you can't just dismiss our opinions as we ""didn't give it a chance"". I give it a chance every other year when my work plays the World Cup 24/7 (including the re-runs) while it goes on and it's boring AF. 

And that's fine bro. I think Baseball is like watching grass grow. Soccer just isn't your thing. My argument is pretty simple, the people who adamantly think soccer is boring without really giving it a chance (clearly you don't fit that category) use diving as an excuse not to watch something they already didn't plan on watching.

&gt;Diving is def another reason that people like me dont like it, but that's not mutually exclusive with the sport in general being boring. But I seriously can't respect players who blatantly act like bitches (and I recognize it's not all players obviously). NBA is almost getting there too but at least most of the time, they're not diving when there's no (/hardly any) contact like the examples posted in this thread. They try to draw the foul and let the foul happen. Not pretend it happened and act like whiny bitches when it doesnt. And aint no NBA player ever gets caught pulling exaggerated shit like THIS. Have some fucking pride in yourself. The whole world is watching and it's captured for eternity.

So the difference between you and most of the people im talking about is that you lose respect for a player, other people lose respect for a sport they never even gave a chance.

&gt;Another reason why I dont like the sport is because this behavior not only happens but is actually encouraged. Why is there no changing the call after the replay? We're in fucking 2017 with cameras EVERYWHERE not the middle ages.

Alth12,purplepill,Purple Pill Man,"They can do yes, it's entirely at their discretion. Europe is negative on free speech. If someone takes offense and the police don't like it either they'll visit you or you'll get called in. Usually it's a warning, but if it's said online there are powers in place for them to shut down your social media presence.

It's unlikely you'd get anything more than disgusted looks and maybe in a big city a leftist type calling you out on it publicly for your example though. But it wouldn't take much further than that example for the threat of police intervention to be there. Put anything with an expletive in there or a slur that can be interpreted as racial and yeah, can be screwed. A good example was after Koln a co-worker of mine put on her Facebook  ""These men need to start acting like human beings instead of fucking monkeys."" That got her a visit and a warning, because 'monkeys' was interpreted as being a racial slur.

Don't get me wrong it's not common, but the threat is there.

Mas que coincidência do catano, ah? Também já me falaram muito de ti e graças ao nosso amigo em comum já tive acesso aos teus contos publicados! Infelizmente o tempo não tem sido muito e ainda não os li como deve ser e peço-te então desculpa por causa disso.

As conclusões que tiras em relação à Chiado são as mesmas que eu tiro. Eu publiquei o livro em 2015, tendo mandado para a Chiado porque alguém me falou e quando vi o email a dizer que queriam publicar, fiquei extasiado e nem pensei. Descobri desde então o que é uma editora ""vanity"" e de facto, o que dizes é verdade. 
Ainda estou sob contracto com eles e, inclusive, tive que lhes mandar o meu segundo livro, embora isto não queria dizer que vou publicá-lo com eles, mas eles ficaram com preferência sobre as minhas obras até 2019... Enfim... Isto são coisas à parte.

Sobre mercados e sobre fantasia é uma coisa que podemos falar em privado, mas digo-te desde já que partilho de muitas das tuas opiniões. 

Sobre o Wattpad: este livro começou como um desafio a mim mesmo e uma maneira de dar às pessoas um livro de graça, que pudessem acompanhar sem compromisso. Pensei ""bem não perco nada com isto e vou treinando a escrever sobre horários, a ser conciso, etc..."" só no decorrer disto tudo é que se deu a série de acontecimentos infelizes e aí tive a ideia de ajudar alguém... Pensei que, embora estivesse efectivamente ""na merda"" como se diz, muitas pessoas estariam a passar por coisas piores, ou coisas semelhantes até e como às vezes umas palavras ou uma história podem ajudar...
Agora é um bocado tarde para tentar fazer as coisas de maneira diferente, julgo eu, mas tenho que fazer o que eu posso...

Fico dependente, sim, da generosidade das pessoas e, eventualmente, das instituições, mas quero acreditar que ainda não está tudo assim tão mau.

Carthagefield,,,"&gt; Americans are used to Jewish influence, it's been a thing for over a century

That's definitely debatable I think. Clearly, most American Jews today (with the exception of Orthodox) have successfully assimilated into American society and with it have attained a certain influence. They now make up one third of Supreme Court judges for instance, which is remarkable considering that a century ago they had none. They are generally college educated and have a higher average income than most. Having said that, things weren't always this way.

Being a relatively new immigrant group, with the vast majority arriving after 1900, Jews from the beginning faced tremendous social discrimination in America. Being newcomers meant that they were naturally looked down upon by the establishment in almost all walks of life, and aside from ethnic and religious discrimination Jews also faced significant economic hardship to begin with. Most Jews back then were very poor, the vast majority having migrated from Eastern Europe, and in 1924 the [Johnson-Reed Immigration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924) was introduced – mainly to restrict the number of destitute Jews entering the United States. Unemployment was rife in the early days as many businesses refused to employ Jews, whilst even some hotels and restaurants had a ""no Jews allowed"" policy.

Exclusive [country clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membership_discrimination_in_California_social_clubs#Minority_groups) and golf resorts would routinely deny Jews entry. To give one notorious example from the 1940’s, Groucho Marx was denied entry to all country clubs in Los Angeles for being Jewish, until one eventually offered him membership with the proviso that he didn't use the swimming pool. Groucho famously quipped “My daughter’s only half Jewish, can she wade in up to her knees?”.

Most Ivy League colleges at one time had [ethnic quotas](http://businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-discriminating-against-jews-2014-12?r=US&amp;IR=T) which limited the number of Jewish students, with some prestigious private schools excluding them altogether. Many middle and upper-class neighbourhoods had restrictive covenants which [barred Jews](http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants_report.htm) from moving into the neighbourhood. Much of this lasted well into the 1980's, despite anti-prejudicial laws coming into effect during the '60s as a result of the civil rights movement.

Having said all that though, you are quite right to say that Russian influence is much more recent and subversive.",True,0,1509583460,,False,0,dp7tsq2,False,t3_7a7ief,t1_dp7sgwz,/r/worldnews/comments/7a7ief/jews_should_concern_americans_more_than_russian/dp7tsq2/,1512034208,9.0,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,public,

Even though some monarchies in Europe survive to this day, they've all had to make massive concessions to their revolutionary movements, to the point where they're now little more than figureheads.

You could say that the ultimate goal of the broader revolution wasn't just to ditch the monarchies, it was to ditch the old monarchical order in favor of the new nationalist one.

Great Britain, also known as Britain, is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), Great Britain is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth-largest island in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.

There's also cultural mental barriers, for instance, eating fish eyeballs. That's disgusting to a lot of people. Also culturally, people are used to eating a huge (in my opinion) chunk of meat for a meal to be filling - whereas in a lot of asian food, there's little pieces of meat that are suppose to be eaten with rice, hence a lot of people complaining they still feel hungry after eating Chinese food. Rice is less caloric than potatoes &amp; bread (western european heritage food). Another example is noodle soup - my friend insists it's not filling enough - he sees ""soup"" as an appetizer to a meal, not the meal itself. Also - the American tradition of eating individual plates vs. Asian family dining style makes it a bit more difficult to fully enjoy ""authentic"" Chinese restaurants, unless you go with a lot of people, because a person is limited to one or two dishes, whereas my understanding of a Chinese meal is a soup, meat dish, a vegetable dish, etc. It's not just one person eating their own plate of moo-shoo whatever and the other diner eating a their own plate.

Honeykill,,Ojibwe,"Yeah, as a beader I have a love/hate relationship with Pinterest. It's useful for skills, but **terrible** for actual cultural teachings. And so many gross culturally appropriative pins. So. Many. But its search functions sometimes outdo google when it comes to specific Indigenous items, so... yeah, mixed feelings. :p

I was an Ojibwe kid growing up in another people's territory. My folks did what you propose -- they taught me about Ojibwe stuff and made sure I had plenty of exposure to local cultures and peoples too. Are there any cultural centres nearby that you could travel to?

For crafts: You could do some very simple beadweaving with big pony beads and craft wire. I made snowflakes [sort of like these ones](http://sandrahalpennybeading.blogspot.ca/2013_11_01_archive.html) with my little cousin last year for Christmas. Note that you needn't go as elaborate as this blog post does -- you could stop at ""round 3"" and still have a cute, decent sized snowflake.

While you craft, you could talk to him about beading history. Long, long ago, we didn't have plastic or glass beads. Long ago we only worked with porcupine quills, seeds, bone, stone, and shell (and metal in some central and south american regions) -- and we had to turn them into beads by hand. Some people still know how to do those things.

When the Europeans traded us glass beads, Indigenous people knew exactly what to do with them! After all, master weavers existed across the continent. We adopted glass beads and made incredible things with them, and we are still doing that today. (Bonus: If y'all have any eastern European heritage, that's another area with a rich history of incredible beadwork!)

You could teach him the Ojibwe word for beads, ""[manidoominensag](http://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/main-entry/manidoominens-na)"", and how it's an 'animate' word, meaning we view beads are living beings, that beads have a spirit. I imagine that many kids would have an opinion on that - I know I did. :)

Or, if you'd rather focus on Menominee, maybe learn the word for beads in that language! I think Menonimee has a lot of similarities to Ojibwe (same language family), so the animacy thing may still apply.

Another craft could be to get round paper or canvas and paint a medicine wheel. While you paint, you could tell teach him about the four quadrants, and the things each quadrant represents.

Really you could apply this process to most crafts. Making little tipis? Talk about actual tipis, what they are made from, when they were used, how people transported them, etc. Learn the word for the craft in one or more of the languages of your ancestors! 

For Ojibwe language and culture, take a look at this puppet show, [Boozhoo Nanaboozhoo](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBoozhoo/videos?disable_polymer=1). It became popular almost overnight on facebook, lots of people saying their kids love it. There's some other fun stuff, and a bit of serious/heavier stuff in there too.

Another resource that may be useful to you is [The Mishomis Book](https://www.amazon.ca/Mishomis-Book-Voice-Ojibway/dp/0816673829).

justsomewordsforyou,,,"I'm a man of routine. I like pieces of structure keeping my life in a pattern. It helps keep my mind aligned for my craft, and has the benefit of getting those around me to trust me. A few small smiles, and generous tips, go a long way to getting bartenders and personal trainers to let me get away with so much. 

Tuesday, I'm at my usual pub. Lucy's Lucky House. The weekends get the college kids, but Tuesdays? Just a few regulars. The place looks a little run down, but it has a... weathered charm. A spilled beer doesn't stain the floor, because theres been hundreds. A little blood doesn't stand out, when theres been plenty. 

The seven tables have no customers. Nor do the seven booths, or six of the barstools. My routine has me firmly established in the Trusted category for Lucy, shes seen more of my money than most. When its time to shut down the barkeep simply gives me a bottle and a quiet nod. I sit, sipping my wine, rolling a small rock in my fingers. There have been a lot of spills over these recently.

I pour more gold into my glass, drop the stone in, and enjoy the sweetness on my tongue. Nothing really competes with the delight of ice wines, despite how Europe tries. The stone dissolves in a small bubbly ceremony. I down the glass, and smile.

The clock on the wall glares 4:59. A series of soft scrapes preludes the back door opening, by a dingy, dirty, thin man. His hair looks like where a rat would live, but how he walks, I can See, or can I Feel? His intent. I knew it coming in this night, from the first stone of the day.

He comes out from behind the bar, feet slapping the stained floor. He reaches for me, and I turn on my stool to avoid, exaggerating my spin and upsetting the balance of the stool. Or maybe the wine did. Who knows. Regardless, I end up on the floor, the stool at my feet between us.

""Look at ya', 'ant evbn stund stright. A 'ice luttle ca ride, eh? Git ya home?""

Of course, what he wasn't saying, and what I could See in his intent... or was it Feel? was that I would end up wrecked by the dawn. Not far from now.

I reach out for the stool still standing next to me, start pushing myself up as he reaches again. He grabs my shoulder, as my balance slips and I fall, pulling him with me from his own grip. The stool gets him right in the eye. The floor acquires a few more stains. He reels back in pain, sees the color on his hand, and with a face the same color, tries to rush me. He didnt remember the first stool.

One leg lands in the middle, tripping him up, and a loud crack fills the room.

I calmly walk out the front door to the screams. They should know better than to try this with me. I can See whenever I want, they only See when they pay.

Or was it Feel?

The in between is using your theoretical mind to complete application tasks, bear with me.

Appropriate answers from everyone so far. I have not studied the subject. This seems similar to a problem I had working in a fast-paced kitchen. Needing to be very present. 

This is a theoretical take. It would bd ideal if I had research to back this claim. The dominant Ni of the INTJ is much stronger than Ni in any other type besides the INFJ. 

Data point: INTJ's are according to the below links, 2% of the population. This is obviously the result of a statistical method that has not counted every person on the planet. Still, with that we can assume that 'the world' does not know how to teach INTJ's to perform good experiments, and be good at it also. You may be able to teach yourself. Why would they? How would they know?

Systems are designed for the mean majority and you are in the minority.
links:  https://www.learning-mind.com/intj-personality-type/ https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality

My HS taught me to be a global citizen, but my family was not like most expats, who are ethnically european, my parents came from Kenya to Canada, and then moved to the Emirates. An added layer to the regular home country to expat country e.g. UK to Hong Kong, or something. Your Ni adds a layer to the regular system.

Instead of using Se, and working with your overwhelming senses, use Ni to stabilize Se.

You may be able to focus on application more easily. Your Ni is casting patterns into the future, and moving your mind like a river or torrent. You have very strong Ni, and it is likely undisciplined Ni. You have not rigorously been taught in school how to apply your Ni. You have likely had to teach yourself. More on this later.

Take in Ni descriptions, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km7ga7HON20

You have likely been trained to approach the Se heavy task of application via your inferior Se or through Si, as would seem reasonable to an Se or Si course designer, so to speak. Of course this cannot work. So. Learn to see the process of experiment differently.

This is my take on your situation, by example. You look at a Beaker full of HCl. You need to perform an experiment with it. All you can do is stare at the blank peace of paper, and the beaker, overwhelmed by the Se information that is being received, filtering into the path and pattern recognition Ni is so reputed for creating. This creates interesting interpretations that are easy to understand as theoretical ideas. Incorrect use of Ni for the purposes of experiment design.

This is the alternate situation. You obviously see the beaker full of HCl, and you have the paper. After disciplining your Ni, you understand that that is not an object you are sensing, it is a potential reality that you see, that reality is an appropriate and interesting experiment, a good application of Ni. Because your Ni is not strictly speaking a well groomed racehorse, and more of a stallion, you are hopeless to tame it into offering present actions. Instead it conjectures wildly and brilliantly.

But in the second situation, you've trained to conjecture along an incremental timescale. So no you can conjecture 5 seconds into the future, 1 minute, 30 minutes and so on. The finished product is 4 hours from now, when the experiment is complete. Cast your minds eye into the finished experiment stage, and then draw a path from you staring blankly at the beakers to the finished product. Good, next step, is to place yourself at the end of 1 min from present, what will you do? No, that's not right, you have already finished the  experiment, remember? What did you do one minute in? In the 'past' given you finished the experiment already, and it was a success.

Instead of seeing the unfinished product, and using conjecture to see a finished experiment, take it to the next level. Move your 'present', the finished product, to 2 hours into the experiment. Now, this point, midway between the present and the future finished experiment, that is the 'finished experiment'. 'Remember' how you 'got' to here from 'there'. But in reality, Se, you haven't even started the experiment. But if you were able to imagine yourself from the standpoint of your future self, see your present self as the 'past', then you can move your future self along a linear timeline, at some point in the 'present', which is really the future.  

You must train your mind to conjecture in small, incremental steps.  An appropriate experiment would be amazing to behold, what does an amazing experiment look like 5 seconds from when it is started?

Well that doesn't help if you're still staring at the beaker and you can't get from your senses into the motions of moving the objects around into an experiment.

Imagine the beaker, yourself, your hands, and fingertips, your voice, are all in the future, where you have finished the experiment, and gathered good data. A future self. 'Remember' the motions that you took to get there.

An example. Obviously, 'remember' you know that the first step you did to get there was hypothesise that the concentration of the HCl is due to ratio between the solute and solvent. Next, 'remember' that you set up 5 beakers with different ratios of solid to liquid. 'Remember' that you chose the simplest table data to present the results. 'Remember' that you read about previous experiments and compared your job with your peers. Obviously, from an Se perspective, you really are working with all these objects in the real, actual present moment. But from an Ni perspective, you are remembering the motions your physical body 'went through', step by step, to get at the Ni vision that you're staring at right now. 

At every step you 'remembered', you act that 'memory' out in the present.

It's a bit wonky but so is conjecture, we can't actually see the future, we just get good at seeing the patterns of the present that we can overlay it onto interpretations that we call the future. This is all speculation.

I can imagine myself rapidly approaching the burning sun to get a better look at it. It doesn't bother my minds eye that in actuality, my retinas would not be the only thing that would get blasted by solar radiation, toasted by sun's heat, and deprived of oxygen in vacuum. In my mind's eye, travelling to the sun in my t-shirt is quite serene.

So should application be. Make application a pantomime of sequential theories leading to the finished, appropriate product. Practice training your Ni. Pretend your body is the body of someone else. Use your Ni, do not work against it.

Be careful with this method, overuse and lack of discipline may lead to feeling like you're not yourself. This may lead to mental illness. I trust you to make well thought out choices.

Do not think about acting in the present world and then acting on it, in some violent struggle of lab coats and goggles. Use your senses and the physical world. Understand the physical world as made of thoughts, that only appear as matter. Now 'think' (act).

Make sure to integrate Se into your day or else you may become completely alienated. That is not a good thing. Touch walls and feel the lines of your face. Accept and feel sensation. 

TL;DR Somehow train yourself to think of application the same way you think of theory, and you're set to be 'really good' at that too.
Mimic what applicators do theoretically. This is a 'work-around'.

Tencent - a Chinese gaming company bought a bunch of Epic - they are catering the games to their market and we are kind of at their mercy.

Tencent is known as a shitty company but was supposed to be ""hands off"" with Epic. My guess is that was just to get the shares, then they decided they wanted Epic to make money like all of the other companies they've bought and turned into cash cows.

They seem to have a big enough influence, or the owners at Epic see the $$$ because they let go the original creator of Paragon and replaced him (and probably others) with people that will tow the line and turn their games into ""services"" ie - mobile game formats with tons of microtransactions and pay gating. Epic has the production quality to draw a ton of bucks from people - they know that.

There was even a blog post from the Epic Chinese Paragon devs stating the reasons for the changes to things like Sparrow's face, the gameplay, elements, designs - basically everything, is to ""align with the chinese socialist core values"" and to appeal to the chinese player base because the ""americans and europeans have all the same pain points"" ie. game is not fast paced enough, or too much of a ""boring"" MOBA.

I think the game will make a decent hero brawler but it's kind of frustrating knowing what's driving a lot of the decisions.

YossarianWWII,,,"&gt; That's wrong. Sorry but the middle east was a beacon of learning 1000 or so years ago, when a particularly cruel religious lot, the Catholics, came and trashed them and turned them inwards.

I wasn't talking about Islam, if that's what you were implying.  But the last 40-50 years have inarguably seen a massive turn against progressive ideas, including women's rights, in the Middle East, most significantly in Iran.  Or it may be more accurate to say that there was a massive setback about half a century ago when the West helped sweep a particularly conservative brand of Islam into prominence and the recovery was not quick in coming at first, but the point remains the same.

&gt;You say Saudi is modernising now, that's fine. In 100 years we can look at their birth rates and see if it has declined or not. The point is, now they are super religious now they are propagating their genes.

And their genes are not what predispose them to religion when compared to other human populations.  You said it yourself, look at the Catholic Church.  Europe, which was once completely in thrall to Christianity in general, now has significantly increased rates of irreligiousness.  The religiousness of the Middle East is due to social and historical factors in the region.

EverySingleImage,,FDR was pro-free trade,"&gt; Are you ignoring Britain? There they set up Sharia courts (!!!) to try to make the Muslims feel welcome. :-(

In that case they are being counter-productive and the point still stands -- they're doing dumber shit with the Muslim community in Europe than we are here. The results speak for themselves. The only difference is they are going about it the opposite way, but ironically the result of keeping them separate remains the same. Holding them to a separate standard by encouraging the enforcement of a separate law for them is just as bad as outright discriminating against them, and in both cases it creates separate communities that will not integrate into the larger culture.

&gt; Honestly Muslims are doing a fine job keeping themselves segregated in many European countries and cultures like Britain think it's racist to try to integrate immigrants into their culture.

I find that hard to believe considering the Muslims here for the most part are willing and eager to integrate. Unless you are saying there is something fundamentally different about the Muslims who go to the US as opposed to Europe, the reason for this must instead lie in the different cultures of Europe and the US and how they are integrated into said cultures. Again, it seems to me that one way or another, whatever their intentions, many European countries seem to encourage Muslims to remain isolated from the larger community. And the US on the whole doesn't, racist assholes in certain places notwithstanding.

&gt;That's not discrimination; that's integrating people into your culture. Making women cover their faces is not part of French culture. Or Western culture. Or even moral.

The point is that it is one more thing that keeps them feeling ostracized or ""otherized"" which in turn encourages them to remain alienated from the rest of the French people, which in turn causes them to grow resentful because they feel targeted and discriminated against, which in turn increases the risk of radicalization. Again, you don't have to go to the opposite extreme and have ""Sharia courts"" to make them feel ""welcome."" You just have to show you are willing to accept them and then the rest take cares of itself over time. That of course doesn't mean you have to accept extremist practices like murdering gay people, but banning hijabs (like them or not) is a rather extreme step that is only going to brew resentment and, I think, is also counter to our own values of freedom of religion and expression.

&gt;I'd say that their security apparatus hasn't been up to the task, unlike our own which learned its lesson after 9/11.

Most of the countries in question have much more draconian surveillance states than we do even post-9/11, so I don't think that explains it.

In any event I think we can agree on two things: That Europeans have no right to complain about how much better they deal with Muslim immigrants than the US does, and that Islamic extremism is a serious problem on its own that is not entirely created by Western imperialism as the ETS people seem to think.

Loimographia,,,"From Wikipedia: “In the 12th century, Gratian, the influential founder of canon law in medieval Europe, accepted age of puberty for marriage to be around 12 (girls) and around 14 (boys) but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than 7.[4] There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than 7: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds.[3]

The first recorded age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the Statute of Westminster 1275 made it a misdemeanor to ""ravish"" a ""maiden within age,"" whether with or without her consent. The phrase ""within age"" was later interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years of age.[5]” 

As an elaboration from my history course on medieval canon law, the 12th century canon law reform movement was deeply concerned about age of consent as it tied into marriage (and marriage = sex; quite literally in that consummation was a critical component of a valid marriage and to be married all you needed was intent to marry at any point in time and then have sex, also called a clandestine marriage), because marriage was a sacrament, and ‘I didn’t consent to this marriage (or to the consummation that made the marriage)’ meant the marriage never existed and was just two people having premarital sex and was a descecration of the sacrament. Given that divorce did not exist, arguments that the marriage never existed permitted for annulments, but also further complications about people accidentally marrying multiple people (polygamy) bc they didn’t understand consent, etc. For example, some canon lawyers argued that saying ‘I will marry you someday’ plus having sex made the couple married, so people could accidentally get married and not know it. This was causing huge problems in figuring out which marriages were bound by God and which were not marriages at all, so canon lawyers and theologians got super into the nitty gritty of what qualified as consent and what did not, how old a child needed to be to understand the gravity of marriage vows, etc. To be clear though, lawyers were less concerned with old men marrying child brides and more concerned about the common issue of betrothals between two children arranged by parents. These lawyers were actually pretty critical in mandating that the children getting married had to actively consent to be married and not just their parents arranging it on their behalf. 

Obvious caveat that my specialty is medieval European history; I can’t really speak to the origins or development of the concept of Age of Consent outside Europe or prior to the Middle Ages.

Riot is seemingly banning people for less and less recently. A bunch of people I've known for a while who are mostly nice and reasonable people have got handed out a 14-day ban for just 1 game of being not even being *super* toxic, just for calling someone an ""ape"" or the N-word once or twice which while being pretty bad it's definitely not ""slap this guy with a straight 2 week ban despite good behavior in the previous thousand matches he has played"" bad. There were supossed to be chat restrictions for chat offenses like this but apparently that system has been scrapped and people just get directly banned instead. I am 100% in favor of bans for truly toxic people who go do things such as ""running it down mid"" in multiple matches or writing a detailed and graphic essay on how they're going to murder and/or rape you, your friends and your family but treating people who had 1 particularly bad game out of hundreds where they couldn't completely contain themselves with the very same punishment is uncalled for. This is in EU by the way, the N-word isn't as offensive as it is in NA here.  
Until just a few months ago usually when I saw a league ban log on the internet it would be 3 matches, maybe 2 if the insults used were particularly vile. Now people get a 14-day ban for just 1 match of acting toxic right away.  

With more people being banned like this the demand for fresh lv30 account grows and as demand grows the supply follows. Perhaps if riot handed out shorter bans, like 3-7 days depending on the scale of the offense it would result in more ""I guess I really lost control of myself there, I'll do that thing I've been putting off because league was taking my time now"" and less ""what will I do with my free time for *half a month* without league?

redditrisi,,,"Intentionally, plutocrats use ""liberal"" when they mean ""alt neoliberalcon Democrat.""  However, I disagree that progressive is clearer. And the original progressive party was started by the left wing of the Republican Party. Wallace was a member--maybe even a founder--of another Progressive Party, that time, the left wing of the Democratic Party. At that time, there was a very discernible difference between someone to the left of Taft and someone to the left of FDR. So, the historical connotations of ""progressive"" are not clear. 

Moreover, Obama, Hillary and other New Democrats identify their policies as progressive; and the Progressive Policy Institute was started by the same people that started the conservative Democratic Leadership Council, the origin of modern Third Way. Hillary, in particular, has said she is proud of her conservative roots (!), described herself variously as a moderate and as a progressive, but shuddered visibly when Chris Matthews referred to her as ""a liberal.""

T800Architect,,,"You've been trying to have it both ways since you started. That's problem number one. You should have cemented a nearly bug-free foundation before you added new things, not add new bugs when you didn't have control of the old ones. Every step of the way, every thing you added should have had its own bug-elimination phase and *regression-backstopping* phase.

The second problem is you keep re-introducing old bugs at a rate *unheard of* anywhere else. Literally, if any other company re-introduced bugs at the rate you have, they would have stopped completely and worked to figure out what the hell was wrong with their *process* that allowed such reintroduction. Do you realize how much of your resources you've wasted re-fixing bugs that you've already fixed before? While many studios have regression problems, not **one** of them effectively *ignores* those regression issues as much as Keen has; they would have gone bankrupt - either bled through their funds or had their investment yanked - long before now. I cannot imagine how you stay in business - either costs are radically low in the Czech Republic, or you're (badly) laundering Russian oligarch money.

You need to face up to the fact that you have *serious* problems with your process, and/or your team. Space Engineers, as the product of a process, has **failed** - you are incurring more technical debt that you can pay off; this comes from a game programmer who worked at a company that failed for exactly that reason. If you managed to gain a profit from this exercise, consider yourself lucky - cut your losses while you can, do a MASSIVE post-mortem analysis to find out where things went wrong and if you ever *do* start another project, make your first priority to never repeat the mistakes you made here.

Mind you, I *want* you to succeed. Your initial idea was great, and I know that running any game studio, much less one in eastern Europe, is as difficult as Hell. I just wish you *had* succeeded, instead of what you did instead.

Good luck with the update - if it happens.

P.S. The point of ""beta testing"" is to find bugs your team could not find on their own - *by definition* re-introduced bugs **SHOULD NOT BE FOUND BY THE PUBLIC**, regardless of ""Early Access"", ""Beta Testing"", or any other status. It is embarrassingly unprofessional to see regressed bugs - bugs you *knew* were possible - hit the public sphere.

sunagainstgold,europe,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe,"My absolute favorite Reformation book is Diarmaid MacCulloch's *The Reformation: Europe's House Divided*, which is long but beautifully written and does not ""feel"" like scholarship. Also, if you're (like me) mostly interested in the German/Lutheran Reformation, maybe the book does not have to be so long after all. :P (Naw, for real, MacCulloch is a wonderful writer and conveys complex issues very well. One very important note: the book is an intellectual history of the Reformation, focused on movements, ideas, and theologians. This is why I love it, but it's also the source of my greatest frustration with it. If you're looking for in-depth consideration of Reformation and Counter-Reformation women or of some Anabaptist groups, look elsewhere.)

Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the United States Air Force and is also the air component command of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). PACAF is headquartered at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam (former Hickam AFB), Hawaii, and is one of two USAF MAJCOMs assigned outside the Continental United States, the other being the United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa. Over the past sixty-five plus years, PACAF has been engaged in combat during the Korean and Vietnam Wars and Operations Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Northern Watch, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

The mission of Pacific Air Forces is to provide ready air and space power to promote U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific region during peacetime, through crisis, and in war.

For examples the Nazis did not turn the Jews into soap, lampshades, or put them into milking machines that masturbated them to death. There was no magical fountain of blood shooting up out of the ground where Jews had been shot either as per a holocaust survivor's report. There were no mass gassings in the millions, although individuals may have been gassed in a little house made to take the life of one at a time. And another holocaust survivor witness swears that you could tell what Jews were being burned in the ovens, because Hungarian and Polish Jews would burn different colors of flame, flames which shot out of the chimneys. We're all ""Holocaust deniers"" to different degrees. I'm sure you personally don't believe scientific impossibilities just because a holocaust survivor said it. But yes, there was widespread Jewish discrimination, which is entirely at the fault of Jewish establishment that oppressed the German population as they owned over 90% of the news media, wrote most theater and movies, owned all the banks, had vested interests as lobbyists in politics, etc (much like most of countries in Europe today). But yes, lots of innocent Jews were killed. However hundreds of thousands were given clemency by Nazis, as some were considered more German than Jewish because they proved themselves, as per meritocracy rather than nepotism. More than 150 000 Jews fought for Germany in the army, some of which ranked as highly as general. Hitler invaded Poland because not only was Poland inciting the attack by lynching, murdering, and harassing the huge German minority still living in territories annexed/stolen from Germany after WW1, but France and Britain was coaxing Poland into mountain an attack against Germany, saying that if they attacked Germany, the moment Germany fights back, Britain and France would side by the Polish. The attack on Poland was in more ways than not justified. Also nobody talks about that Russian invaded Poland shortly after Germany did.

hahayeahhaha,,,"In South Africa in 1856, the spirits of three ancestors visited a 15-year-old Xhosa girl called Nongqawuse. According to her uncle, who spoke for her, the spirits wanted the Xhosa to destroy their crops and cattle. The tribe’s ancestors would then return and drive the white settlers into the ocean. New, beautiful cattle would appear. The sun would turn red. The Xhosa duly began killing cattle and burning crops. This type of self-destructive quest for riches and freedom is now known as a “cargo cult”. (The word “cargo” denotes the western goods the tribe hopes to obtain.)

Brexit voters come in endless varieties. However, the particular sect now steering Brexit — the Europhobe wing of the Conservative party — is turning into a cargo cult.

At the heart of it is ancestor worship. There’s a widespread belief in Britain that “the past is the real us”, says Catherine Fieschi, head of the Counterpoint think-tank. Perhaps no other country has as happy a relationship with its chequered history. And the self-appointed guardian of this relationship is the Conservative party.

Hardly any of today’s Tories actually remember Britain’s golden age of ruling India and winning the second world war. Even the party’s ageing members are merely the children of the Dunkirk generation. Economically, they have been the luckiest cohort in British history. But they and many other Tory MPs feel the shame of late birth. They disdain the UK’s tame, vegetarian, low-stakes, Brussels-based, post-imperial incarnation, which in 70 years offered nothing more glorious than the Falklands war. Now they have their own heroic project: Brexit.

Cargo cults typically start when the tribe feels it is in decline, surpassed by foreigners. In Melanesia, the Pacific region with a tradition of cargo cults, locals came to feel like “rubbish men” (the phrase is pidgin English) in comparison with rich Europeans. “A recurring feature of these cults is a belief that Europeans in some past age tricked Melanesians and are withholding from them their rightful share of material goods,” writes Paul Sillitoe, an anthropologist at Durham University.

To get these goods, the tribe has to mimic modern rituals that seem to have made advanced societies rich. Melanesians built airfields to receive the ancestors’ cargo. The Brexiter flies around signing trade deals. Meanwhile, the inferior goods of today’s “rubbish men” must be destroyed. Hence the eagerness in this Tory sect (but not among the British population at large) to shut off trade with Europe. If the correct rituals are followed, the ancestors will return. The sect leader, Boris Johnson, in his biography of Winston Churchill, sometimes seems to cast himself as the reincarnation of the great “glory-chasing, goalmouth-hanging opportunist”.

But the cargo cult is threatened by non-believers. They can ruin things by angering the ancestors. For 15 months, Nongqawuse blamed the failure of her prophecy on the few Xhosa — amagogotya, or “stingy ones” — who refused to kill their cattle.

Now, leading Conservatives are hunting British amagogotya. Chris Heaton-Harris seeks to out Remainer university teachers, Jacob Rees-Mogg castigates the BBC and the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney as “enemies of Brexit”, while John Redwood urges the Treasury “to have more realistic, optimistic forecasts”. The sect also suspects Theresa May and Brexit secretary David Davis of being closet amagogotya. That is probably accurate: as Britain’s point-people in the negotiations, these two sense that cattle-killing might not be a winning strategy.

Sillitoe says it’s wrong to dismiss cargo cultists as “irrational and deluded people”. In fact, he writes, “Cargo cults are a rational indigenous response to traumatic culture contact with western society.” Comical as the participants might seem, “they are neither illogical nor stupid”.

Certainly the Conservative cult follows its own logic. The aim isn’t simply to reduce immigration or boost the economy. Rather, Brexit reaffirms the tribe’s ancestral values against a disappointing modernity. The difficulty of Brexiting is part of the appeal: only a great tribe can renew itself through sacrifice. The stalling of talks with the EU is welcomed as a ritual re-enactment of Britain’s past glorious conflicts. Hence the ovations for any speaker at last month’s Conservative conference who urged walking out with no deal.

A recent blog by Pete North, a founder of the Leave Alliance, beautifully sums up many of these attitudes. North, who favoured staying in the European single market, predicts Brexit will send Britain into “a 10-year recession”. He writes: “After years of the left bleating about austerity, they are about to find out what it actually means.” And yet, he continues, “My gut instinct tells me that culturally it will be a vast improvement on the status quo.” He says modern Britons have become “spoiled and self-indulgent . . . in the absence of any real challenges or imperatives to grow as a people”. As the psychiatrist says of the TV character Basil Fawlty, there’s enough material here for an entire conference.

After the cattle-killing, many Xhosa starved to death, while flocks of vultures reportedly watched from above. Refugees who fled to the British Cape Colony were forced into serf-like labour contracts. But Nongqawuse lived on for another 40 years, albeit in exile, under a changed name.

Misnagdim (מתנגדים‎; also Mitnagdim; singular misnaged/mitnaged) is a Hebrew word meaning ""opponents"". The term ""Misnagdim"" commonly refers to opponents of Hasidism. The term ""Misnagdim"" gained a common usage among Jews living in Europe as the term that referred to Ashkenazi Jews who opposed the rise and spread of early Hasidic Judaism.

**Shuckling**

Shuckling (also written as shokeling), from the Yiddish word meaning ""to shake"", is the ritual swaying of worshipers during Jewish prayer, usually forward and back but also from side to side. This practice can be traced back to at least the 8th century, and possibly as far back as Talmudic times. It was said of Rabbi Akiva that when he prayed by himself he would start in one corner and end up in another, because of all his kneeling and bowing. It is believed to increase concentration and emotional intensity (Eisenberg 2004:360).

[deleted],,,"That doesn't answer the question.


&gt;But the real background one needs to grasp in order to understand this system is Carl Schmitt's political theory of Großraum or ""great space"". Schmitt's original Großraum theory was one inspired by the American Monroe doctrine. He held that the policy of forbidding any kind of intervention by other powers in their sphere of influence they proved that the world was organized in empires who each had their allotted larger space in which they were free to do as they want. Continental Europe was Germany's space in that calculation and the vision Schmitt laid out consisted of Germany ruling Europe, Britain ruling its empire, the US ruling the American continent, and Japan ruling Asia; with none of them interfering in another power's ""Großraum"".


General Plan Ost describes what Germany wanted to do with Eastern Europeans and other undesirables within it's intended sphere of influence, not what relations it intended to extend to her allies. While there were some allusions to what Germany intended- see the quote- they didn't actually make it into any formalized documents under General Plan Ost.

I think with the Pixelbook (and also the Pixel phones to an extent) Google might be trying to avoid the trap Microsoft fell into. Windows was (and still is in some contexts) very dominant but the typical interaction people had with Windows was poor - either a locked down under specced corporate PC at work or (usually) a really bad under specced machine from a vendor who has installed McAfee trial edition and other such crap on it. A Macbook probably really does seem amazing if you're comparing it with a typical new Windows laptop from Lenovo or Dell. (Microsoft's Surface line attempts to rectify this problem but it's something they should have done ten years ago.)

To try and reduce the association of Android/ChromeOS with cheap (and therefore often low quality) they've kind of gone to the other extreme by consciously pricing their Pixel stuff above what I'd normally consider competitive.

there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.
britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.
so now they can make
many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast
then they invent some trains.
and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.
hey, china! said britain.
buy stuff from us!
nah dude, we already got everything, says china.
so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.
which worked, actually.
but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.
so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.
britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.
also, the
sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now
""that's just where he lives""
india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.
nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.
technology is about to go crazy
the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.
it's bad, they decided.
and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.
i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.
they never got ethiopia
britain and france are still hungry.
they never got thailand
the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.
hawaii
cuba
wait, spain controls cuba.
well, blame something on them and go to war!
what should we blame on spain?
let's blame the maine on spain.
so they blame the maine on spain.
now we're in business.
to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.
britain just found oil in the middle east.
it makes cars go
china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.
europe hasn't had a war since the last war.
so they start world war 1.
look at those guns.
it's gonna be a great war.
so great we won't need a second one.
after it's over, they blame germany.
russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.
now everyone's paycheck is the same.

the arabs revolt and britain helps.
now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the
jewish people a place to live
hopefully the arabs won't mind.
let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.
except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey
and then the saudis conquer arabia.
it just seemed like the right thing to do.

yes, it's the 1920's calling.
let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.

germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.
and he's mad at the jews for existing.
japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.
they should probably just deny it.
hitler's out of control.
so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.
but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

one of them can be bangladesh later.
the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.
me, they both said at the same time.
let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.
sike, they both get angrier
look out china, there's a new china in china.
what's on the menu?
communism!
no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.
i wonder which one is the real china?
there's the korean war, korea versus korea.
nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.
let's meet the sponsors.
oh, it's the two global superpowers.
they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good, and which one is an evil virus of Satan.
and they both have atom bombs.
fight!
wait, no, that would be the end of the world.
let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.
and make sure we have enough atom bombs.
i'll race you to space.
now let's make some more countries fight themselves.
europe is tired of pillaging other continents, so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.
so here's a new map, with new countries.
now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.
the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.
they decided it's bad, and the world agrees.
south africa might need another minute to think about it.
let's check the world population.
whoa.
okay.
technology's better too, that might keep happening.
the soviet union decides to relax a little, and accidentally falls apart.
europe makes a union, so now they can all use the same money, except britain, because they don't feel like it.
let's check the mail.
surprise, it's on the computer.
whoops, someone just attacked america.
i bet they'll remember that.

smeggletoot,,,"Try telling that to native indians, [aboriginals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_DHwp5vYBI) or the [stolen generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations).  Fortunately the internet generation have grown up in a world without borders where they don't see age, skin colour, or religion as a barrier to communication and the sharing of knowledge.  

And, thanks to platforms like facebook and youtube, we have been able to share the wise lessons from those ancestors that came before us...  This cognitive awakening cannot be stopped by old patriarchs of the 'shock and awe' persuasion who deal in lies, any more than their lies and fear mongering could stop the abolition of slavery, civil rights, the rise of women's rights and the end of facism in Europe.

Of course, the late great American scientist Carl Sagan foretold all this decades ago when he recorded [who speaks for earth?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjrmK8t6VYk).

How proud he would be to see the things we are building on the internet today, and the collective cry of the crowd shouting in unison ""we all do!"".

there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.
britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.
so now they can make
many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast
then they invent some trains.
and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.
hey, china! said britain.
buy stuff from us!
nah dude, we already got everything, says china.
so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.
which worked, actually.
but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.
so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.
britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.
also, the
sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now
""that's just where he lives""
india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.
nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.
technology is about to go crazy
the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.
it's bad, they decided.
and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.
i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.
they never got ethiopia
britain and france are still hungry.
they never got thailand
the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.
hawaii
cuba
wait, spain controls cuba.
well, blame something on them and go to war!
what should we blame on spain?
let's blame the maine on spain.
so they blame the maine on spain.
now we're in business.
to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.
britain just found oil in the middle east.
it makes cars go
china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.
europe hasn't had a war since the last war.
so they start world war 1.
look at those guns.
it's gonna be a great war.
so great we won't need a second one.
after it's over, they blame germany.
russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.
now everyone's paycheck is the same.
communism
in the soviet union
the arabs revolt and britain helps.
now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the
jewish people a place to live
hopefully the arabs won't mind.
let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.
except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey
and then the saudis conquer arabia.
it just seemed like the right thing to do.
hello?
yes, it's the 1920's calling.
let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.
the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever, just kidding.
germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.
and he's mad at the jews for existing.
japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.
they should probably just deny it.
hitler's out of control.
so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.
but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.
that's world war 2
bonus round!
pacific showdown.
united states vs. japan.
fight!
finish him
let's unite all the nations and have some
world peace
seems legit.
hi, i'm gandhi, and if britain doesn't get the hell out of india, i'm gonna starve myself in public.
wow, that worked?
bonus, now there's pakistan.
actually two pakistans.
one of them can be bangladesh later.
the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.
me, they both said at the same time.
let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.
sike, they both get angrier
look out china, there's a new china in china.
what's on the menu?
communism!
no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.
i wonder which one is the real china?
there's the korean war, korea versus korea.
nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.
let's meet the sponsors.
oh, it's the two global superpowers.
they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good, and which one is an evil virus of Satan.
and they both have atom bombs.
fight!
wait, no, that would be the end of the world.
let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.
and make sure we have enough atom bombs.
i'll race you to space.
now let's make some more countries fight themselves.
europe is tired of pillaging other continents, so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.
so here's a new map, with new countries.
now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.
the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.
they decided it's bad, and the world agrees.
south africa might need another minute to think about it.
let's check the world population.
whoa.
okay.
technology's better too, that might keep happening.
the soviet union decides to relax a little, and accidentally falls apart.
europe makes a union, so now they can all use the same money, except britain, because they don't feel like it.
let's check the mail.
surprise, it's on the computer.
whoops, someone just attacked america.
i bet they'll remember that.
phone call.
surprise, it's in your pocket.
wanna learn everything?
surprise, it's on the computer.
now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket.
whoops, the economy just crashed.
don't worry, the big banks won't fail because they're not supposed to.
surprise!
flying robots.
with bombs.
wanna print a brain?
some people have no friends.
some people have no food.
the globe is warming
and the ocean is full of plastic
let's save the planet! said everybody, not knowing how.
let's invent a thing inventor, said the thing inventor inventor, after being invented by a thing inventor.
that's pretty cool.

Old-school death metal. Just a catch-all term for the early death metal sounds.

I know Anata! I discovered them really early on too actually. Thanks for reminding me of them though, I'm awful about never finishing exploring any band's catalogues, so I still have a couple albums from them I should get to at some point.

some people hink pep was a born manager - but he learns as well - he had to adapt the team not just to his style but two other styles within the prem style - he has to make then domestic winners and also european quality.

winning those napoli games wouldn't have happened before - they have confidence - when we see what has happened before to city in the CL they had the ability but not the confidence - now they can up their game and win the tight games.

Russia has some unique attributes that can only be explained by centuries of deliberate manipulation in favor of ursine interests.

1) The territorial expanse of Russia.

As a human territory, Russia doesn't make a lot of sense. It is a globe-sprawling tract of inhospitable tundra, wetland, steppe, and most of all, boreal forest. However, this is perfect for safely hosting a discreet bear civilization.

It would not be so large if it were a human-governed territory. The conquest of Siberia took centuries, cost enormous resources to conquer and maintain, and was nigh-impossible to defend. The Russian Empire would later decide that it had over-extended itself and relinquish bear-dense territories in the Pacific Northwest to the then bear-neutral United States. Later, they would lose a war to Japan. Internal upheaval that a smaller country could handle with ease would often cause semi-permanent loss of territorial control over parts of the sprawling territory.

Basically, Russia's geographical situation didn't make sense as a deliberate policy choice unless it was to accommodate bears rather than humans.

2) Suppressed human demographics.

Russia has enough land to feed and house many more people, but nonetheless has often had population problems. Wars have historically been a source of population depletion. Feudalism was brutal in Russia. The USSR (the successor state to the Russian Empire) killed many in the Holodomor, the gulags, and encouraged abortion despite a lack of progressiveness in most other respects. Modern Russia has been stymied by low birth rates and population decline.

Why? Because the human population of Russia must be kept low in order to make room for the bears.

3) Russian Politics

Politics in Russia, while widely varying on the surface, has always been characterized by three attributes: instability, secrecy, and hierarchy. The tsardom, the USSR, and modern Russia all had or have these attributes in spades. These are the attributes you would expect to see in a society that was being puppet-mastered by a group against their own interests. Hierarchy for control, secrecy for, well, secrecy, and instability to distract and prevent the populace from ever gaining power. Furthermore, Russia doesn't merely employ these, but actively seeks to export them as part of its foreign policy. It manages its satellite states this way, and uses the principles as a blueprint for disrupting the anti-bear west, secretly supporting disruptive political groups in an attempt to destabilize it's rivals. Why? Because North America is prime bear territory, and Europe is or would be as well.

4) Culture.

The populace accepts poor conditions despite being literate and well-educated due to a rich culture that strongly features cynicism and hardship. The great works of Russian art, music, and literature generally reflect this. Beardom has encouraged development of such a culture because it understands that in order to tolerate a situation, humans must be able to craft meaning out of it. Thus, if humans must suffer to make space for bears, then that suffering must be an embraced core of their identity.

Additionally, the bear as a symbol of national identity features strongly in Russian culture, possibly opening up future doors to acceptance of their secret overlords.",True,0,1509617376,,False,0,dp8dx91,False,t3_7a6ido,t3_7a6ido,/r/italy/comments/7a6ido/russiagate_la_fabbrica_dei_troll_raccontata_da/dp8dx91/,1512044727,-2.0,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

Some people evolved on very little starch, and don't have the ability to digest large amounts of it.  Some people can't digest lactose (though this isn't bad, and can be a good thing, since lactose fosters good bacteria and your inability to digest it doesn't limit your energy capacity like starch).  

Some people are capable of synthesizing more/less of certain fats because they evolved in a hot/cold climate.  And finally, it wouldn't be surprising if people who evolved in low-sugar environments are less equipped to deal with large amounts of it.

Here at the 161st, we have a mature approach to arma. We train hard and take pride in being a professional, team focused group, yet while having an informal environment, where military etiquette, ‘yes sir, no sir’, etc., [we believe] isn’t necessary. We think we have a good balance as a group. Military based tactics, comms, etc., but within an informal environment (with jokes/banter at appropriate moments). We consider ourselves a semi-milsim group.

You are trained to understand principles, to be switched-on, and to have a situational awareness. You will not be micro-managed or simply told, to do, or not do something. We’ll teach you the why i.e. you’ll manage yourself… self-responsibility is the basis upon which we build our unit. As a trained recce trooper, you’ll make the decisions and intentions of the leader happen.

We are a friendly, informal bunch, but our standards are high. Being a team player and being willing to learn, is what we ask for and a commitment to that.

We have an 18+ only policy.

We are patient in training people new or relatively new to arma, so if that's you, you are welcome. Vets of the game, would be of course very welcome.

We have various roles and troops, e.g. marksman/driver, LMG/Gunner, UGL,AT, etc.

&gt;Because, and you might need to sit down for this, the EU is more important to (most of) the rest of the world than the UK.

Depends, economically yes, but the EU isn't a military power. Britain on the other hand is second most important player in NATO (not in manpower, but in terms of capability, nuclear forces, power projection etc), an alliance geopolitically opposed to Russia. And anyway, Brexit won't even destroy the EU. If anything from what I've read, Brexit will make the EU much stronger because with the most euroskeptic member leaving, the EU is free to go down the path of creating a federal european superstate- but heyho even the Russians make mistakes

or maybe putin is playing chess, Putin supports Brexit because he supports a federal Europe with a unified military (which is only possible after Brexit), which would be a counterpoint to NATO and make it irrelevant, which would be good for Russia. My point is though, Russia wants to sow discord and chaos, that's why the Russian state funds far right groups and communist remnants, and even funds green parties- it basically uses it's oil and gas wealth as leverage.",True,1,1509620383,,False,0,dp8f3lo,False,t3_7a7u2o,t1_dp8a7dr,/r/Scotland/comments/7a7u2o/russians_set_up_shop_in_scotland_to_force_new/dp8f3lo/,1512045346,-1.0,False,Scotland,t5_2qkli,public,
FuckYourPoachedEggs,Red,Agnostic Masorti,"I never said those were isolated incidents either. They're a wave of ideologically inspired attacks, either inspired by ISIS (which doesn't have the capacity to directly administer attacks anymore, as far as I'm aware). Or by Hamas, which does have that capacity.  

In the case of Europe, Islamic extremists often exploit youths by directly citing the xenophobic, Islamophobic rhetoric from right-wing parties. They tell those kids, who are often the children of immigrants, that those countries don't want them, and the politicians prove it. They twist their anger into genocidal fanaticism. 


Anti-Arab acts of terror in Israel are inspired directly by the statements of people such as Mr. Benjamin ""Arabs are voting in droves"" Netanyahu or Naftali ""I've killed a lot of Arabs"" Bennett. Not to mention the settlers who think that our historic connection to the Land of Israel means that everyone else should be driven off it. You have mobs of Haredim chanting ""Death to Arabs"" in the Muslim Quarter on Jerusalem Day.  

Do Jews have an obligation to defend themselves? Yes, in Israel and in the Diaspora. Do we have the same rights to sovereignty and self-determination as any other people group? Of course, but our rights shouldn't come at the expense of the Palestinians and vise versa.

That's why we here (using NYC as an example) need to have greater self-reliance, and less economic and general dependency on the local governments.

NotALeftist,,,"&gt; The average impact in retail is 2.63% given they have 14% foreign born workers. Given the £8 hourly wage you used, that's 21p per hour lost.

This is not the impact on natives, which is the only thing relevant to your argument against immigration. The impact on natives is, according to your BoE source, 1p an hour over 8 years.

You've completely manipulated the BoE report to misrepresent it's actual findings that the effect of immigration on low skill natives wages is infinetisimal.

&gt; So my figures are wrong because....?

Because they say absolutely nothing about the effect on natives wages, therefore not at all a valid criticism of immigration. 

&gt; Incidentally, your report that natives are unaffected had this in it.

&gt; &gt; Nickell and Saleheen (2015) find small wage losses for occupations with fast increases in immigration. Their results imply that all EU immigration since 2004 has reduced semi/unskilled service sector wages by only about 0.7% (compared with a 4% increase in the minimum wage over the same period, Centre for European Reform, 2016). But they do not separate wages of the UK-born from immigrant wages as we do, so even their small effects of EU immigration on wages may be coming from its effects on other immigrants. Furthermore, the occupations that lose may be counterbalanced by the occupations that gain in a local area, meaning that the overall effect on the area’s wages is zero, just as we find.

&gt; Which is a way of saying that averaged out, the impact is small.

What? No. Wrong. False. It is not saying that at all, it's clearly saying the opposite. You do understand how research works, right? The authors of this study, which demonstrates no effect on low skill natives whatsoever, are trying to explain how earlier research had different findings.

They are explaining the discrepancy by the fact that the Nickell and Saleheen (2015) analysis didn't make the distinction between native and migrant wages, so to use that as evidence that immigrants lower wages for natives is stupid.

&gt; I'd also disagree with only looking at the impact on natives anyway. Immigrants deserve the same wages as anyone else, if wages fall then that's a bad thing whoever it is happening to.

Already addressed. Completely irrelevant to the discussion which is about policy that best benefits Britain and doesn't harm low skill natives.

Hei fra Objektivist-skolen, ja. Morn, morn, du.

Når ""kritikk"" involverer å true med tap av midler og forskningsgrunnlag for å oppnå en helt spesiell utforming av rapportene, da er kritikken ikke ""kritikk"", men åpen politisk motivert påvirkning.

Når man utfører vitenskapelige undersøkelser med en åpen og dokumentert prosess, selv om man ikke liker emnet eller konklusjonene veldig godt, da er det fremdeles snakk om vitenskapelige undersøkelser. 

Så vennligst legg merke til hvem som truer med å bruke sin politiske makt i departementet og i regjeringsposisjon for å få tak i spesifikke rapporter som reflekterer deres eget syn.

Du kan også legge merke til at FRPs stortingsgruppe og justis- og beredskapsdepartementet har tidligere insistert på mange rapporter om hvordan man skal tillate å omgå Flyktningekonvensjonen, EU og FN, såvel som Utlendingsloven i forhold til å kunne omgå større deler av den. Dette ble spesifikt kritisert i høringsprosessen i sammenheng med endringene av Utlendingsloven - der både tiltakene og forslagene ble poengtert at ville være ulovlige. Frps statsråder implementerte det likevel, og bestilte rapporter med en ordlyd som ga Listhaug en mulighet for å si at det de hadde gjort ikke var spesifikt ulovlig.

Justisministeren bestilte ellers nylig en rapport om hvorvidt det ville være mulig å omgå lover om overvåkning, slik at et privat masseovervåkningsprosjekt - som vi fremdeles ikke har filla peiling på hva er - skulle kunne sies å være lovlig.

JustinVx2,,,"/u/Ferik5/ gaat nergens inhoudelijk in op de post van /u/helemaalnicks , dus er is niks om op in te gaan. Ik koppel helemaal niet alles en iedereen aan het fascisme, /u/helemaalnicks koppelt Baudet aan het fascisme en geeft daar een bijzonder goede onderbouwing bij. Overigens ga je zelf vervolgens niet in op mijn post.

Maar goed, hier de ideeën achter fascisme en hoe Baudet hier naar streeft:

&gt; 1. Mensen van Europese afkomst vormen een biologische, culturele en politieke eenheid (het blanke ras).

Dit idee komt heel erg duidelijk naar voren in [de toespraak bij de presentatie van zijn partij](https://forumvoordemocratie.nl/actueel/toespraak-thierry-baudet-fvd-alv-2017). Hij gebruikt Nederlandse, Europese en Westerse cultuur door elkaar (en gooit ze daarmee dus op één hoop). Hij spreekt daarbij constant over ons en wij, en beschrijft de Westerse cultuur (lees: de blanke cultuur) zelfs als één organisme waar kwaadwillende, agressieve elementen (lees: niet-blanke mensen) worden binnengeloodst. In het interview met Filemon Wesselink geeft hij aan te willen leven in een land dat 'dominant blank' is. 

&gt; 2. Vijanden willen deze eenheid (het blanke ras) vernietigen, door middel van niet-westerse immigratie en multiculturalisme.

Zijn uitspraak over homeopatische verdunning is hier natuurlijk het beste voorbeeld van. Het is overigens ook een goed voorbeeld van dog-whistling, doordat hij later zegt dat het daarbij niet om ras maar om cultuur gaat. Adoptiekinderen worden getolereerd.

De vijand is overigens het 'partijkartel', oftewel alle andere politici. In werkelijkheid zijn dit natuurlijk gewoon de (overigens zeer verschillende) politieke partijen waar in Nederland het overgrote deel van de mensen op stemmen, maar volgens Baudet leven we in een schijndemocratie, of een oligarchie. 

&gt; 3. De enige manier om de Westerse eenheid (het blanke ras) te redden, is door iedereen die buiten de eenheid valt uit ons land te verwijderen.

De eerste stappen hiervan zijn te zien in het verkiezingsprogramma van FvD: Cultuursubsidies mogen alleen nog de Westerse cultuur promoten. Het Internationaal Strafhof en het Europees Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens moeten worden ontmanteld. Een direct gekozen minister-president met véél meer bevoegdheden. Uit de EU en het heroverwegen van internationale verdragen, om te voorkomen dat andere landen iets kunnen doen. Grenscontroles terug.

YouSmellFunky,drkcyn,I fap to cracks.,"CPY is not website, they're a scene group responsible for cracking most Denuvo games and they don't have a website, but you can find their cracks on torrent/warez sites. Based on what people here have been saying IGG sounds safe, but here's my list:

* **[cs.rin.ru](https://cs.rin.ru/forum)** - Your first ""go to"" place. Forum about steam games where users upload game files and updates as soon as they are available. Useful for finding the latest update for a game or downloading ""crack only"".

* **[The Pirate Bay](https://thepiratebay.org)** - Good for finding older games.

* **[RARBG](https://rarbg.to)** - Verified torrents by scene only. No repacks and clean of duplicates.

* **[Zamunda.NET](https://zamunda.net)** - Clean and very good speeds. Requires account. (To search torrents click on ""Bananas"")

* **[Torrentz^2](https://torrentz2.eu)** - Torrent search engine. Indexes torrents from various major torrent websites.

* **[TorrentProject](https://torrentproject.se)** - Another search engine, but a bit messy.

* **[RuTracker](https://rutracker.org)** - Russian, but very good speeds. Good for finding GOG releases and repacks of latest versions. Requires account.

* **[REVOLT](https://revolt.group/)** - Steamworks fixes that allow you to play cracked games online with other pirates.

* **[Zooqle](https://zooqle.com)** - Has potential.

* **[FitGirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site)** - Most recommended repacker on this sub. Smallest sizes, but long installs depending on PC. Good speeds when downloading through ""RuTor [magnet]"" link.

* **[R.G. Mechanics](https://rg-mechanics.org)** - Not R.G. Mechanics' official website, but legit. Excellent speeds and can find almost any game repacked to latest version.

lurifaxkondiakk,,,"&gt; Det er full innvandringsstopp i Norge, og har vært det i 42 år.

Det er det absolutt ikke, dette er et ord som ikke har noen verdens ting med virkeligheten å gjøre.

&gt; Norge tar ikke imot innvandrere, vi tar imot flyktninger og asylsøkere ihht internasjonale forpliktelser. Man kan ikke sile ut 'kompetent arbeidskraft' fra disse gruppene. Enten overholder man disse forpliktelsene og tar imot dem som trenger det, eller så stenger man grensene og stiller landet utenfor det internasjonale samfunnet. Man kan ikke 'kvalitetsvurdere' mennesker. Bare vurdere behovet for opphold.

Her tar du feil på alle punkter. Se på denne listen som viser totale antall ankomster til landet for hvert år siden 1951.

http://www.ssb.no/300132/folkemengde-per-1.januar-fodte-dode-flyttinger-og-folketilvekst-sa-48

Deretter kan du oppsøke statistikk om antall ankomne via flyktning- og asylsøkerkategoriene, også vil du se ganske raskt at disse tallene rett og slett ikke stemmer overens.

Norge tar imot innvandrere, og vi tar imot helt ekstreme andeler av dem. Man kan forøvrig kvalitetsvurdere mennesker. Hvis man observerer at en ""stakkarslig"" flyktning/asylsøker har deltatt i grusomheter, bærer på holdninger og verdier som er den direkte motsetninger til våre egne og samtidig ikke kan bidra overhodet, men heller vil skape mer kvalm i samfunnet, så burde man ganske enkelt ikke slippe inn vedkommende - uansett. Det spiller ingen rolle om vedkommende har et reelt behov for beskyttelse - hvis risikoen er at vedkommende kan skade det norske folk, burde dem ganske enkelt ikke få slippe inn. Da er det faktisk bedre at dem ender opp med å bli drept i hjemlandet.

&gt; Om du vil miste denne rettigheten er det bare å stemme oss ut av EØS

Det norske folk stemte nei til EU, to ganger. Deretter ble vi snikinnført via EØS. Hva det norske folk vil i denne sammenheng er krystallklart, men så har man det faktum at demokrati i det store og det hele bare er en illusjon, og dermed er vi påtvunget dette svineriet uansett.

TheHazardousOne,pills10,RIP Afterlife,"Sounds like a plan dude! (Cheeky post incoming)


Riffing of a post I saw in /r/nostupidquestions that i found oddly poignant, I’m my TL;DR at the beginning of the post. It works here lol.


TL;DR - 

* know your limits, trust your instincts
* exercise responsible down periods between rolling 
* pay attention to what your body tells you
* don’t cheat yourself out of an amazing experience
* I am fuckin tired as shit right now


—For you and anyone else who would like to partake in some amusing...musings(?) by someone with a lot of experience, both good and bad but all worthy of learning from please read forward. Good day—


Now I was taken back a little by the LSD/rave  comment..and while  some of my fellow harm reduction enthusiasts may be aghast at this, but if I may....allow me be pragmatic here and take a moment to step out of the” ~30 year old, married w/ a kid and good career guy that’s seen it all” costume and bestow some real World shit on you based on years of experience - 


Disclaimer :


*this is not my endorsement to dose once a month either on the regular, please let this be clear* *moderation is always key, know your limits* 


With that out of the way....*real world shit:*


If you end up at, or have an opportunity to attend an actual underground rave , or even a trance festival in EU that runs the old school, sunset- sun rise schedule (9pm-7am etc) so long as it’s been at least 4-6 weeks since the previous, truly active dose, you’re in otherwise good health, and actually  have, (and plan on *continuing to have) your shit together* — I can’t in good conscience advise against experiencing the combination of a rave, or other form of live trance/EDM/deathcore lol(unless you’re into that, then fuck yeah)crazy lights, and amazing tribal vibes shared by a huge group of people on MDMA. That would just be criminal.  I’m being totally sincere here. 


Conversely, I can not recommend doing it again any less that 3 months after that. I’d usually recommend waiting longer than normal after that sort of event, especially if you went super hard. The physical activity and all that comes along with it can do a number on you; but as an anomaly, in an other wise healthy life with responsible patterns of use - just know that you should be good on that one time occasion if it’s been at least 4-6 weeks. And if you’re the experience one in a group, make sure you set a good example for the noobs. Don’t let em come away from that sort of thing thinking it’s healthy to do it all again next week. 


But again.. I digress - 


Ultimately you get a feel for what works best for your body in terms of both dosage and down time between them given whatever the current state of your health is at the time. PBut don’t cheat yourself on what could truly be a life changing and formative experience, based on arbitrary time limits.  Your gut instinct will tell you, better than the internetz, whether the 6 weeks it’s been before dropping this fire pill at Dreamstate is a good idea.  But as my last post said, don’t Chase the dragon and don’t use this
Logic to justify frequent use.  Pragmatism and moderation, easy peasy. 


The reason I emphasize that last concept so much, despite the claims that MDMA is not “physically addictive “ is this :


Now I don’t want to scare you, but if you’ve never experienced it before, that feeling that happens when you’re truly connected with everyone being guided by those drums..can be very hard to resist and it can be hella tough to remember the toll it takes on you when your spending your weekend “innocuously dancing And loving the world” with your new friends at that sick club, BigEuphoriaRoomStateOfTomorrowlandHouseEnergyTranceKitchen..Club....house?

AzarinIsard,,Ezekiel 23:19-20,"&gt; I think he is confusing Jewish and Israeli, which is not a good thing to do.

True, but Israel are just as guilty of it when it suits them too. They're no stranger to blurring the lines between anti-Israel and antisemitism. We can criticise Russia all we like, but any criticism of Israel is always deflected as being antisemitic in order to shut down any discussion. Most public figures steer well clear of discussing Israel because it's just not worth getting dragged into that kind of talk, as Farage is finding now. He's put his foot in it. Of course, I agree that someone who hates Jews would likely hate Israel, but I would also say there's plenty of reasons to criticise literally any country. No country is perfect, and you don't have to be a racist to object to what certain nations get up to.

Although, I am finding this foreign ""meddling"" controversy interesting. Is this not what we call ""soft power""? Wouldn't you expect almost any country to pursue their own interests?

mr-strange,eu,Citizen of the World,"That's an incredibly tone-deaf opinion. Try to place yourself in the position of an EU-27 citizen living in the UK... Britain has become an incredibly unwelcoming place, overnight.

Essentially, your point is this: ""post-Brexit Britain will have approximately the same immigration requirements as Canada, so what's the difference?""

Well, the difference is the _direction of travel._ Canada has just signed CETA, and seems in favour of further embracing globalism. Britain has just severely curtailed Euros' citizenship rights - relegating them from first- to second-class citizens. Idiots on the streets shouting ""go home"" has become a very common experience.

So much has changed in so short a time. How much further will Britain go? Will the changes continue in the same vein?... These are totally reasonable concerns. For many EU citizens, staying in Britain feels like a risky option. If they have the option of going elsewhere, then *why wouldn't they?*

None of that applies to Canada.

Kitzinger1,,,"What came really close to happening and nearly did was the Nuclear Bombing of North Korea during the Korean War.

Harry S. Truman decides to use Nuclear Bombs at the border of Korea and China thus keeping China from reinforcing North Korea.  It works and North Korea collapses and surrenders within a few months after the nuclear bombings.

This sets a precedent that Nuclear Bombs can be used in any engagement and has a profound reaction upon all the Global leaders about the restraint of using Nuclear Weapons in armed conflict.  There would be no nuclear taboo and no restraint in their use.  The US used them and they won and now the gloves are off.

In 1956, a few years after the US launched nuclear bombs along the China border, the Hungarian Revolution begins but the USSR see this as an opportunity to set an example by deploying nuclear bombs in select cities in Hungaria not only squashing the revolution but also sending a stern warning to any other countries in it's empire not to even contemplate revolting against them.

The next big event is the Cuban missile crisis but instead of a blockade the US decide to simply nuke it into oblivion.  The USSR retaliates and destroys Turkey.  The world is on the cusp of WW III but tensions slowly back down as both the USSR and Western Europe acknowledge that the destruction would be nearly life ending for both sides.

The next great use of nuclear weapons actually happens between China and the USSR over border skirmishes in the Mongolian and Siberian areas.  This goes on for a few years with vast areas being uninhabitable thus creating a large uninhabitable zone that can't be crossed by both sides.

Now, Vietnam begins...  All the major developed countries see this as one big proxy war.  Nuclear war engulfs Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

India and Pakistan nuclear conflict.

USSR Afghanistan nuclear conflict.

It is 1985 and the USSR realizes that in just a couple more years they will be economically destroyed.  They are facing utter ruin if they do not do something quick and thus comes WW III as the Soviets invade Western Europe.  This leads to a shocking nuclear exchange that ripples into the US.  Western and Eastern Europe is destroyed as are numerous countries in the Middle East and Africa.  Amazingly, China, parts of Asia, South America, Australia, and New Zealand are left unaffected.  The US has suffered a few devastating nuclear attacks on some of it's cities but the economic depression in USSR had rendered most it's long range attack abilities mute.  The USSR though has been destroyed.  What remains is remnants of a great empire that survive because they were too small to be cared for.  A nuclear winter hits causing wide spread famine.  This leads to a new World Body forbidding nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons being developed and a new age begins.

If that inflationary pressure caused by the bank rate cut, QE and TFS were not there arguably consumer spending would have been higher anyway and the BOE is merely trying to cure the side effects of one policy with another policy which has even more side effects. 

Secondly, the bank rate was at 0.5%, close to what we could consider the ZLB, therefore any bank rate cuts would have a diminished effect compared to a cut further from the ZLB, it would have been better to  have used fiscal policy in this case, one possible option being to stretch out the plan to cut the deficit, and to allow for some moderate spending increases in the present.

We still have to leave the EU to cut immigration. If democracy is to be followed, the EU has to be left on this matter alone.

&gt;This is massively naive. If this stupid farce of brexit goes ahead, nothing anyone wants is going to get done for the next ten years.

Maybe, fact is though that not leaving meant it wouldn't happen ever.

&gt;And they'll have a perfect excuse, the 'will of the people' was brexit and they had to deliver it. Of course that meant that to deliver it to the british people they would have to increase immigration, make public service cuts, the whole shebang. They've got the perfect excuse for any failing or unpopular program for at least the next decade. They don't even have to blame themselves or the opposition, they can blame the voters.

Immigration isn't going to increase, its going to reduce. Public services are going to get boosted and the rich are going to get rinsed. 

They have no excuses left for non popular policies, so we will (at long last) get them.

woodendolphin,,,"&gt;Umm. They gave us people? Humans? You know there’s that....

Evolution gave us people. As to where people evolved, the jury is out on that. For decades much of the world was off limits to western scientists, places like China, Russia and Eastern Europe. Western scientists decided that humans evolved in Africa in part because they didn't have access to the fossil records in much of the world. During this period Chinese scientists (primarily, but not exclusively) were using the fossil records available to them to produce different but just as plausible theories. DNA analysis indicates that pre humans from Africa are present in all modern humans, but that should not be taken as proof that all modern humans came from Africa. Evolution happens in small increments, and the difference in achievement between modern humans in Africa and modern humans in other parts of the world would seem to indicate that human evolution has advanced further outside of Africa than within it. Neanderthals seem to have added advantages to European humans, as have some pre human species that evolved in Asia.

She can lawyer about the Bible in ways that 99% of us would get dizzy over (and that includes the Christians). I've talked about these issues with her, about my discrepancies, and it's not just the 1st commandment. There are numerous places throughout the Old Testament where other gods are mentioned; either to be described as demons (Deuteronomy), or false idols, or otherwise. The Old Testament is basically a record book of God crushing the competition.

But yes, there are many ways that the syncretization of Europe's cultures into Christianity affected Christianity as a whole. This or that god became this angel or that demon, hell became a place where bad people go when they die, but Christianity also appropriated and adopted heathen moral concepts such as sin (though they've bashed it all to hell and back and as I've said elsewhere, it's nigh-unto-impossible for us to reclaim it now).

That being said though, I no longer attach any significant feels to my former Christian life. More than half my life has been a pagan one at this point, and even if it wasn't, today's Christianity isn't a threat to me, and I've got bigger fish to fry.",True,0,1509628485,,False,0,dp8jqjc,False,t3_7a15cv,t1_dp83anh,/r/asatru/comments/7a15cv/we_all_have_baggage_what_are_you_doing_about_it/dp8jqjc/,1512047775,1.0,False,asatru,t5_2r5lh,public,

Add to that: 
- massive corruption
- very recent memories of genocide and war
- bordering nation states of Serbs and Croats
- the economy propped up by IMF
- declining workforce

GinSmokeLies,bluepill,love made me crazy,"&gt; female androphobia is very loosely correlated with violence against women. USA seems quite androphobic currently, despite objectively measurable rates of violence against women being at historic low. Sweden seems to be rather chill, with lower rates of androphobia, despite being sexual violence capital of Europe. Japan seems to lack both problems.

And again, I'll ask how you know that ""androphobia"" isn't the *cause* of the low rates of violence against women? Maybe if the women in Sweden were more androphobic like American women, they wouldn't be attacked so much.


&gt;More than that, I have never seen data successfully predicting that pathological fear of *anything* is capable of preventing *any* kind of harm.

I don't understand why you need ""data"" to prove this, it seems self-evident. If I'm pathologically scared of snakes, I'm going to avoid snakes which means I'm probably not going to die of a snake bite. If I'm pathologically afraid of driving so I walk everywhere, I'm not going to get in a car crash. If I'm pathologically afraid of men to the point where I go out of my way to avoid them, I'm less likely to get hurt or killed by a man.


&gt;And finally, if your assumption was true, domestic violence would have been nearly non-existent. Letting a violent psychopath, often with proven traceable history of violence, into your life, into your house and into your panties - is not a ""cautious"" behavior. Letting him into your [family](https://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/selection/2014-yao.pdf) - is outright the opposite of ""cautious"" behavior.

Okay, so women are somehow simultaneously pathologically afraid of men but also let them into their homes freely even when they're violent psychopaths? You seem to be contradicting yourself.

SabaziosZagreus,david,Jewish,"That's not fair.  As far as I'm aware, the source is not affiliated with the Catholic Church.  The article itself, even if you think it is too biased, discusses real myths that exist around Luther and Protestantism.  Luther was not a peerless champion of free thought, literacy, modernity, and rationalism.  People have a habit of incorrectly ascribing to Luther humanism.

It is true that Luther's protest was embraced by kings who used it to their own ends, and common people had little more voice and saw little different.  As the professor of Protestantism at my local university often says, ""For the kings of Europe, Luther's theology simply allowed them to set up themselves up as their own 'pope' in their own, autonomous church.""

It is true that Catholicism was not stagnant before Luther.  The Catholic Church had been in a process of reform and improvement prior to Luther.  The Counter-Reformation can (and is often) seen in response to Protestantism, but it can also be read as a continuation and a necessitated step in the Catholic history of reforms.

It is also true that Weber's theories have been questioned.  Although the Protestant work ethic may have great support among laymen, I've never had a professor who endorses it.  Instead, I have had multiple professors who launch into emotional denunciations of the theory of the Protestant work ethic whenever the theory is raised.

Maybe you think the article is biased, poorly written, or goes too far.  I don't know what you think.  However, the article does mention some myths that people have about the Protestant reformation, and I believe these myths are accurately called as such.

Du coup, retour au refuge le vendredi, et on y a trouvé [ce petit bout](https://imgur.com/gallery/RWtj8), arrivé la veille. Comme ma mère n'était pas la et que ca reste son chat à elle, on y est retourné le samedi avec elle pour refaire un tour. Finalement elle a eu un coup de coeur elle aussi sur ce petit européen très vif et joueur, bien qu'encore un peu peureux. Il a une particularité tout à fait craquante : sa queue est atrophiée de naissance.

Très content d'avoir de nouveau une petite boule de poil pleine de vie à la maison. On doit juste aller voir le véto en fin de journée car le loulou a des petits problèmes respiratoire, rien de bien méchant.

Pois. No que, pessoalmente, me parece relevante, acho que é.

[How would you describe or sum up what kind of author Vollmann is? (I wish he would do an AMA!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vollmann/comments/7abo1z/how_would_you_describe_or_sum_up_what_kind_of/)

Post-modern, historical fiction, travel-writer, journalist, genius adventurer and philosopher.

Kind of hard to label his work. And think about the sheer amount he has written over the last 30 years. Sci-fi allegory, journalism, history, travel, war-zone reporting, fiction, historical-fiction (vikings, jesuits, inuits/arctic circle, mexican-california border, central europe, Pocahontas and John Smith, native N. American cultures mixing with overseas ""visitors"",  prostitution, drugs, US subcultures, US history, Mexican history, The Tenderloin in SF, ghosts and the paranormal, love, depravity, poverty, violence, Japanese theater, Nez Perce, Copernicus, Train-hopping, a book where he assumes an alter-ego to examine gender, and much much more. 

This guy is amazing. How would you describe him to someone who had never heard of him? What do you think is his greatest work (if you can choose)? For me personally I would have to say the Seven Dreams series is his major tour-de-force. These books combine history, imagination, in-depth research, and journalism. He experiments with language and style. And they make us look at history from a new perspective, which can teach you something if you are paying attention.  My favorite (so far) I believe I would say is *The Rifles*, i will always remember his journalism from above the arctic circle in this one, this book is fascinating and very important in this day and age where gun control is still such a major issue. What do you think?

Any questions? Ask away! I love talking about books.

Well, with this particular bit which we discussed, about Nuland. The tapes are confirmed to be true (US officially apologized for fuck the EU comment), you can listen to them and hear for your self that she is discussing who should be and who shouldn't be in the Ukrainian government. This bit is conveniently omitted from the documentary. Don't you think that what you called ""actual reality"" is a highly selected reality? 

I mean, complete speculations (unless they have mind reading devices they cannot have any idea of what Putin actually thinks) are presented as facts and hard facts are completely ignored if they don't support the narrative. Is that what you call ""actual reality""?

IrishFlukey,Ireland,Ireland,"A lot of non-Europeans live in Europe or have visited and have an insight into Europe which gives them sufficient knowledge to answer.  As long they are not answering from a stereotypical idea of a European, rather than the actual truth, there is not any major problem.  If they come from the same country as the actual questioner, they may also have a slightly better understanding of what the questioner's mindset is, and can contribute on their level.  As things are, a lot of the questions are country or regional specific, but other Europeans from outside those countries or parts of Europe answer.  So taking all of those things into consideration, there is no reason why non-Europeans cannot answer questions.  Their insight and perspective can prove useful.  In any given thread the majority of answers will be from Europeans, so having a few non-Europeans answering is no harm at all.

Kesuke,,,"I'm not really trying to sell you anything here other than my own insight which you can take or leave. But it is also why I posted [this link](http://incheshiremagazine.co.uk/east-cheshire-nhs-welcomes-spanish-nurses/) as it very much takes the personal aspect out of it... but [you don't have to take it from just one source](http://www.therotherhamft.nhs.uk/Holatonewnurses/), infact you don't even have to take it from two sources [because there are plenty](http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/spanish-nurses-proving-a-hit-at-the-hospital-1-2370125) out there that highlight the type of nurses that have been coming from the EU. They are mostly newly qualified nurses from Spain and Portugal (as a result of their youth unemployment problems). It doesn't matter whether a nurse is newly qualified from Madrid, newly qualified from UCL or newly qualified from Yale School of Nursing... it's going to take them time to develop skills in the job and that is what they come to the UK to do - then they go back to Spain and Portugal. 

&gt; The nurses in the ward were at least 30% Portuguese and the care by all staff including them was amazing.

I think this might be where you are getting caught up. Care by nurses should be amazing full stop. It doesn't matter where they are from, it is what they are paid to do. If your care from a nurse isn't amazing then there is a problem. It's like if a fireman wasn't very good at putting out fires, or a banker wasn't very good at banking... nurses provide care and if they aren't good at caring then that is a problem. It sounds like you rightly observed nurses doing their job. That doesn't mean to say they can't be nice people doing it, and they almost always are, but that isn't the point.

To be clear this isn't about whether these are nice people or not (they almost always are lovely in that way that youthful, beautiful, caring Spanish girls are in the prime of their life)... Instead it is about whether this is efficient. As someone who works in the NHS I have found it frustrating that we invest a lot of energy and money into developing skills in this group of staff only to have them leave a few years later and take those skills with them. Most of these girls are very upfront that their intention is only to work in the UK for a few years before returning home. This is basically their ""gap yar"".

It means we have an oversupply of under-skilled newly qualified nurses from the EU but we then struggle to recruit more senior nurses. What we need are more nurse specialists (nurses who have done their time on the wards, are a little bit older and have been back to university to complete higher training programs in specific areas). Personally I would sooner see us shift our efforts into expanding training for nurses in the UK not just at the undergraduate level but also at the specialist level. When we do recruit from overseas we need to be more long-termist and we should be basing our decisions on whether to employ someone based on their intention to stay here. 

Two other areas we could look at would be expanding nursing places for men (the UK has one of the lowest rates of male nursing staff anywhere in the western world, even among English speaking nations). Equally we could be trying to get part time nursing staff back to full time work. There is a particular issue in nursing where the predominantly female workforce hits 30-35 and they want to do what 30-35 year old women do which is have babies and stay at home with those babies. There is nothing wrong with that, but getting back into work afterwards can be an uphill battle that puts a lot off. Improving working conditions and making the process easier to get people back to work might actually produce results. It's potentially a very cheap way to get nurses who are already trained and experienced back into the fold.

There's purpose behind the viscerality of Last of Us, there is purpose for the themes and how it explores them. Entertainment for you is not the same for others. Some people prefer action Hollywood flicks over European Art-house films.

Let's use Witcher 3 as an example - though Witcher 3 is an amazing game that has its own merits - what did it do to create something new that no other games had done before it? What was so revolutionary that no other game did before it? Everything in the Witcher has absolutely been done before (let's not pretend like it hasn't) but it refined everything with such great polish that the whole package felt whole and rewarding. The Witcher 3 took everything from its predecessors and made it even better. The Last of Us did things other games had done, but put polish on it and made it feel coherent in a way others hadn't done before. Not to mention workflows that the entire industry adopted because of Naughty Dog's work; motion capture, voice and video recording during mocap sessions, character and environment workflows. It's not just the work of art that pushed games further, but also just the way in which it was made.

Now that I think about it, they just label themselves as ""Spaniard"" or ""Spanish"" when it comes to ethnic classification and nationality in Europe.
