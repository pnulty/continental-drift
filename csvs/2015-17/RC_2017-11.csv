Suleiman_Shouaa,,[VERIFIED - TSKRS],"Hey,

Not sure if you're still looking but just in case..

I think my corp (Tuskers) could be a good fit for you. We’re a relaxed (no minimum activity levels, no CTAs, fly what you want, when you want etc.) mature solo/small gang PvP corp with an active community, where some members have been around for 5+ years. We use out of game comms (Slack) to communicate, which makes joining fights even easier - a simple ping means when you do log on, there's something going on. We use Mumble as our voice service of choice and during EU primetime we normally have 5-10 guys chatting away, with another 5-10 idling. 

Historically, we were a low sec pirate corp, but most of us have found more fun living in a Class 2 Wormhole with a static NS &amp; C5 for PvP &amp; logistics/PvE respectively. We think this wormhole offers the best mixture of logistics &amp; PvP - the direct NS gives us plenty of opportunity for fights (at the moment we are getting about 50-80 kills per day) and the C5 gives us decent logistics. 

We run a mixture of organised gangs &amp; impromptu gangs. Some examples:

Our first attempt at Covert Lokis, we killed two carriers (http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=150891 and http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=150894) in &lt;30 minutes and managed to get back into our wormhole before the locals collapsed it.
A few weeks later, we managed to kill a Rorqual + its sub-cap defensive fleets with minimal losses, despite fighting 3 gangs simultaneously (RR Hyperions, Cruiser Gang, Dread + Rorqual) - http://killboard.the-tuskers.com/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=152626.

&gt; O ministro da Justiça, Torquato Jardim, fez críticas contundentes ao governador Luiz Fernando Pezão e à segurança pública do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, em entrevista ao Blog de Josias de Souza, no portal UOL, nesta terça-feira (31). Segundo Jardim, Pezão e o secretário de Segurança, Roberto Sá, não têm nenhum controle sobre a Polícia Militar. Ainda segundo Torquato Jardim, a morte do comandante do 3º Batalhão da PM (Méier), Luiz Gustavo Teixeira, na última quinta-feira (26), trata-se de um ""acerto de contas"", e não de um assalto. Ninguém assalta dando dezenas de tiros em cima de um coronel à paisana, num carro descaracterizado. O ministro afirma que com Pezão ""não será possível"" melhora na situação da segurança do estado - ""a virada da curva ficará para 2019, com outro presidente e outro governador"" - e que, diante do fato de que ""a milícia está tomando conta do narcotráfico"" em decorrência da prisão de chefes do tráfico, essa horizontalização deu mais poder aos comandantes de batalhões da PM. Hoje, os comandantes de batalhão são sócios do crime organizado no Rio"", sentencia Torquato Jardim. Pezão frisa também que as escolhas de comandos de batalhões e delegacias fluminenses são decisões técnicas e que jamais recebeu pedidos de deputados para tais cargos.

TheWoodElf,ru gam,,"I hear you, and of course all this is personal speculation. 
My argument is that 'we've been mediocre most of this season' is not due to lack of player excellence. I maintain that EU's problem has never been individual talent: name one season with boring/bad EU players? In fact, I would argue that, historically, our progression throughout worlds, much as it was, has actually consistently depended on individuals, with casters and even korean players repeatedly highlighting EU playmakers. 

Now if we look at the *problems* of EU performances at Worlds, we see a couple of notable player mistakes or poor performances here and there. But more noticeable are seemingly random weak drafts, inconsistent late-game macro (which is almost always the downfall of EU teams internationally) and failing on execution as a team. What do all of these have in common? Coaching. If there is an area where EU lacks severely (compared to Korea at least) is visionary coaches, that can find answers to the meta, read and adapt to a Bo5, and provide cohesion and guidance to shotcallers. 

I think Huni is a great example of what an excellent coach can do with a highly mechanical player that likes to take risks and play big, but hasn't been as successful with previous teams. On the other side, you have Forgiven being given Sivir time and time again.

Se você não conseguiu ainda um emprego, então invista um pouco do seu tempo livre para se aperfeiçoar, fazer cursos para a sua área, reler os materiais de faculdade, aprender novas coisas como um novo idioma e por ai vai.

hehemyman,,,"&gt; . However, I challenge your viewpoint from the fact that if you change your arbitrary start year for your post, the results change drastically.

It's not arbitrary though. You have to draw a line somewhere because terrorist attacks 60 years ago aren't as pertinent to terrorist threats today. Where would you draw the line?


&gt; Since September 11, 2001, how many planes have been hijacked and flown into buildings as a result of Islamic terrorism?
&gt; None.

Yes, but modern terrorist threat experts anticipate a similar attack on a similar scale within the next generation.


&gt; Given your acceptance of statistics as part of your post, would you not consider the attacks on September 11, 2001 an outlier?

No, again if you consult terrorist experts the chance of another 9/11 like attack is very high in the near future.


&gt; Given that it has not happened in over 16 years (can you recall the last time this happened in the United States- as far as I know, it hasn't), security has changed dramatically for air travel, and passengers' mindsets are likely to have been forever altered in the event that someone attempts to hijack another plane, would you not consider September 11, 2001 to be the start of a new period of terrorism (including Islamic)?


Again, its not an outlier because the threat of another similar attack is still very high.


&gt; Sure, if you include the attacks on September 11, 2001, you're post is accurate regarding the United States. But if you don't include those deaths and consider them an outlier or the start of a new era of terrorism, your figures are either borderline or inaccurate.

You can't just disregard the death count of 9/11 when doing a terrorism analysis. That doesn't really make sense to me. I mean yes, outside of 9/11 Islamic terrorism isn't as bad(but I consider the Orlando shootings to be terrorist in nature- as do the professionals) and the numbers aren't as overwhelming.



I would even agree that the Islamic terrorism threat in America isn't nearly as bad as it is in Europe.

Mr-X1,,,"&gt; I think it's a bit silly that you are so offended by this.

That does not change the facts. Despite their claims those people are only Americans and in this context that is the only group as members of which they can speak legitimately. Everything else is just rude and ignorant and whether Americans care or not, they should be contradicted when they publicly claim to speak as members of groups to which they clearly do not belong.

Btw: The amount of racist bullshit I heard from those ""pseudo-Europeans"" is enormous. I mean, while their usage of weird, outdated stereotypes is often merely annoying, their frequent desire to continue old conflicts that have long since been resolved and to reintroduce already overcome forms of bigotry, often alongside more ""American"" kinds of racism, is actually quite bothersome. Here in Europe we have enough homegrown racist morons already, so we really do not need for that stuff to be pushed by outsiders. During the last elections, in various European countries, American right-wingers even tried to interfere by supporting all that alt-right and far-right bullshit that has been somewhat popular recently. Notice that if so many Americans were not that obsessed with their ancestry, the leadership of the American far right might have had less of an interest in spreading their bullshit to other countries because their ""clientele"" would simply not care enough about said countries for something like that to make sense. So this stuff is indeed both offensive and rather bothersome.

&gt; I think it's a bit silly

wonkmelikeahurricane,other ,Former LARPer,"Here is my favorite ghost story from the region.

The legend of the Postmichel (Postman Michael):

In 1491 there was a postman whose route was between the capital city of Stuttgart and the Free Imperial City of Esslingen.  One day, when watering his horse between the 12 kilometer route, he saw something shining in the ground.

He went to pick it up - it was a beautiful signet ring of gold, embellished with rubies and emeralds.  In short, bling.  But he was a true and honest postman, so he decided to finish his route and take it to the wealthy city of Esslingen and inquire about it's owner.  But he didn't want to lose the ring, so he put it on his own finger.

He came into the fish market square, blew his round horn, and everyone came and collected their mail. Then he tied up his horse and went to his favorite local tavern where he was just about to inquire about the ring.

Unfortunately for Michael, a man had already spotted the gleaming ring when Michael was distributing the mail.  Before Michael even had time for a sip of his beer, this man cried out, ""Brigand!  Let me see that ring!""

Michael obliged, as he was after all seeking the owner of the ring.

""Murderer!"" the man cried.  ""This is the signet ring of my poor uncle, murdered two years ago.  His killer was never found.  You must be the one who killed him and thought you could lay low and everyone would forget!  Well, I do not forget, as I am the nephew of that man.""

And so poor Michael was arrested.

And tortured.  I'll spare you that bit, but let's just say that it was enough to make anyone confess to anything.  That's how torture works.  That's, by the way, neocons, one of the many reasons why torture is bad and you shouldn't support it or excuse it.

So Michael confessed under duress and was sentenced to the relatively kind fate of beheading (let me know if you want a discussion about executions in Europe and why beheading was a good thing).  His last request was granted: to blow his postman's horn one more time.  After doing so, he looked the nephew in the eye and said, ""I go to the grave for the sake of your inheritance, but you will not rest easy until the true killer is found.""

Then his head was chopped off.

But the next year, on St. Michael's day, a ghostly horseman appeared in front of the house of the Stuttgart executioner (the guy who killed him - the Esslingen executioner was sick that day or maybe he just didn't want to execute a guy who everyone knew was innocent), then blowing his horn, he did his old postal route from Stuttgart to Esslingen, ending in front of the house of the nephew of the murdered man.

""Well, this sucks,"" thought the nephew.  So he left town.  But the next year, on St. Michael's night, September 28th, he was again visited by the ghostly apparition. 

""Maybe Germany is the problem,"" he thought.  So he left.  He roamed the world, but regardless of where we went, on September 28th, the ghost would appear to him. 

He returned to Esslingen, sick and hobbled, aged before his time even though he was barely 50, and dying in the famous Katerinaspital he confessed, on his deathbed, to murdering his wealthy uncle and pinning the blame on the poor, innocent Postman.

The city of Esslingen felt like crap for killing the wrong guy, so they made a fountain in his honor that shows the story and they celebrate the legend every St. Michael's day as a festival where children reenact the story and if you think that's inappropriate that's why American children are weak.

faintpremonition,army,ARMY,"&gt; Fascism is only nationalist in the sense they appeal to nationalism to justify their militarism. In other words, Convincing Citizens to Support War 101. Every country of all ideologies has been doing that for thousands of years. If you argue that makes fascism nationalist then everything's nationalist.

No, you obviously don't know shit about the philosophy under girding fascism. Militarism is a feature of fascism because it's inspiring but fascism isn't inherently expansionist in its politics. (Hi Franco.)

Fascism is inherently nationalistic because it re imagines class struggle as national struggle between developed nations and emerging nations. That's at its core.

&gt;You are disingenuously conflating nazism and fascism because you have no other argument, nazism is exactly what says it is... nationalist socialism. Fascism, on the other hand, can exist with minimal nationalism.

No, you're wrong again, and in my previous couple of comments I was specifically talking about Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile and Italian fascism. Mussolini was a far more respected fascist, (you know before the war) and far more influential in developing fascist thought than Hitler ever was. Hitler's grand contribution was adding in explicit racism to fascism, something Mussolini never thought important to the political structure fascism.

&gt;The only difference between communism and fascism as far as I see it is fascism doesn't explicitly consolidate all economic power within the party.

Well, to be blunt, that's because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Fascism is a political system and communism is a stateless economic system that is intended to exist post politics. You are right to distinguish between the levels of economic control between fascism and *socialism* (which is a political system) in that fascism uses state ""guided"" capitalism, and socialism prefers a state run economy in place of capitalism of any kind.

&gt;Fascism tends to favor corporatism (ie pro-monopolies) and socialism is pretty much just one huge monopoly owned by the Party. It doesn't matter that the two tribalistic ideologues hate each other, they're very similar in practice.

We... agree. This is incredible! I'd niggle that they aren't very similar practice, but rather they are very similar in experience for the ""end user."" In practice they get to the same state of deprivation under different practices. It's (sorry to go back to analogies) like Sunni and Shia Islam. They vary wildly, but to anyone looking in on the outside it's all Islamic nonsense.

&gt;I like nationalism and self-determination-- 

Me too!

&gt;which is why I favor Catalonia over the EU's desires.

I favor Spain's desires over Catalonias desires because an autonomous region is, in my view ones step too low for where to federalize, and that Spain is the right size to be a federal polity. The EU is the wrong size.

&gt;*You prefer globalism and fascism*, which is why you want Spain to dominate over other cultures because that's the only way the EU will remain stable. I could give two fucks about the EU and would prefer they collapse.

This is not what I've said. Forget for a minute where globalism and fascism are incompatible views (find me a single instance of any of the big three fascist leaders having world domination plans), it's just flat out not true since I've explicitly said over and over again that I don't prefer fascism, or globalism, but rather federated republics that work on the level of the nation-state. 

When Spain invades France then we can talk about Spain getting too aggressive with the cultural dominion.

So to sum up:

EU: too big! No good.
Catalonia: too little, and whiny. No good!
Spain: juuuuuuuuust right.

This is not an endorsement of Spain's progressive policies, and I also think they should treat all of their citizens equally.

The shallow phenotypic traits we mistakenly call race exist more at the epigenetic level, a level above the genes that makes the same set of genes express in different ways (one trivial example: identical twins have different fingerprints and iris patterns). When you read the entire genome, you find that everyone alive today is at least 95% African. Scientists believe these traits evolve in as little as 2500 years, virtually overnight in evolutionary terms, and that the traits we call race didn't even exist at all until perhaps around 70,000 years ago.

Once we learned how to read the genome, we confirmed what scientists had long suspected due to other evidence: that there is no meaningful correlation between what we call races and how closely individuals are related. For example, Ethiopians are much more closely related to certain Mediterranean Europeans than they are to Pygmies, despite the purely-visual observation that they are both ""black.""

Barthaneous,,,"Absolutely right. But remember this, Christ himself made a whip and beat men out of the temple of God for defiling the House of God. He was angry and pissed alot , especially at the Pharisees,  for holding man made traditons and laws over Gods laws. We today however  think there is no law anymore. Yet we are the temple of God in the flesh. Its repeated over and over again by lukewarm Christians ""there is no law under grace"". Then what may I tell does God come back and judge the world by? By our works. Not our faith.  He makes it clear that ALL men are without excuse on knowing the laws of God. Thats why the 10 commandments have always made sense to the the recieving tribes and nations when missionaries came into the land. Because Christ said the 2 laws which are the greastest are the two that sum up the 10. Love God above all. Which is the first 4 commandments. And then "" Love thy neighbor as thyself"" this law sums up the remaining 6 commandments. The powers at be however, in every nation that recieved the word of God that like the Pharisees who by lusts and pride, didnt want to give up their power so thus persecution took place, and the Christians were known by these powers and rulers by keeping the commandments of God. Not by just having faith..
And here in America however it is based and founded on Christian prinicples. But it is not a Christain nation. If it was then Christ would be in the constituion directly instead of the title Creator. This was specifally not introduced so the influence would be world wide and to cause all faiths to gather together. . So again here we have Christians who struggle with the world because they confuse the two types of people they want to be. American traditions such as these holidays are fairly recent, because immigrants from Europe brought them into the land and they became popular and now are great buisness and marketing ploys, for major corporations and have influenced the churches.. But they cause the people to dwell in material and lustful appetites which is satanic in nature.  If you are for Christ then you are for Christians first before American's. Not the other way around. This must be known and this is the message of all the prophets. Repent(change your mind) remove the idols of your home and mind and put Christ above all. Cleanse yourself. Until then you have in you but the spirit of lukewarmness. And like God says about lukewarm believers ""i know you not  youbwicked servant, and I will spit you out of my mouth"". Dont be that believer. Satan believes and knows and so do demons, but they honor him not. The times are at hand and  the powers of darkness are planning amd conspiring their revival for the end.

Hey I live in the US. How was I supposed to know that you live there? And, How can you claim legal category as fact when it depends where you are? 

Here, your claim is wrong and my Raleigh is a bicycle, throttle or not. 

&gt;...faster vehicles need to be kept separated from vulnerable road users.

They wont allow it for that reason, you say? Bicycles arent currently separated from car traffic enough to be safe anyway! Actually, having bicycles be unpowered and on the side of the road just makes it more dangerous for everyone.

 It would be safer if high powered bicycles  could legally take the lane full time in town up to 30mph, with turn signals and all the equipment of a motorcycle. That way they can ride without slowing anyone down or pissing anyone off. The only real difference would be the weight and in town at that speed it can be much lighter than even the smallest motorcycles, outperforming them, out maneuvering them, being safer. Currently in the US, the legal concern that keeps fast bicycles from being road legal is insurance and lighting. Bring it on, I say. It only costs $50 per year to insure small motorcycles.

ShadowsSheddingSkin,,,"&gt;Toronto is 47.5 European immigrants and the rest fillipinos, chinese, and other.

This is not true. As of 2016, 47.5% of Toronto's population *as a whole* was foreign born. The top four nations of origin for Toronto's immigrants, again as of 2016, were China, the Philippines, *India*, and *Sri Lanka*. Among recent immigrants - moved here in the last five years - it's the same except Sri Lanka gets bumped by Iran. The single largest visible minority group in Toronto is actually *South Asian*, who make up nearly a quarter of all visible minorities in Toronto and 12.6% of the population of Toronto. 

&gt;You didn't consider the ethnic differences in London and Toronto. London has a huge South Asian immigration population while Toronto does not. (yet)

Also wrong. 12% of London's population is from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. 12.6% of Toronto's population is South Asian. We have a higher percentage of South Asians relative to our population than London. 

Check the census if you want confirmation of any of this. It's not hard. 

&gt;Also that's wrong, crime is proportionately higher among second generation immigrant children, but only among certain ethnic groups. (ex. Jamaicans)

Are we shifting goalposts here? Because I thought we were talking about the city's ~1.2 million immigrants, not their ~600,000 kids. Doesn't matter either way. For the former, the studies  - Hagan, Levi &amp; Dinovitzer, Sampson, cannot be fucked to find every study on immigration and crime - seem to show lower crime rates than people that were born here, completely independent of and uncorrelated to their place of origin, and while Levi &amp; Dinovitzer found that second generation immigrants - again, across the board, not quite sure where your numbers come from - have higher rates of crime than first generation immigrants, no one's published anything meaningful supporting the hypothesis that they commit more crime than third or fourth generation Canadians/Americans/Whatever. 

tl;dr: Your first two sentences are completely and verifiably wrong, and figuring it out takes two google searches and adding three numbers, while every piece of evidence I've seen contradicts your third point but I'm not going to bother actually spending more time on this.

&gt;I’m all for expanding mainstream philosophy to include more non-Western thinkers and ideas. But only after we have it undergo the same scrutiny with which we have examined Western philosophy.

Again, *what* scrutiny? The current canon has practically zero scrutiny outside of tradition.

I'm all for more scrutiny, but I think you've got it totally backwards. The western hegemony on philosophy is *benefiting* from the absence of scrutiny. In the absence of any real grounding in reality or practical results, Eurocentric bias has enough room to define the entire academic focus.

If we had any *actual* scrutiny, most of the Western canon would be removed. Note that the sciences, which undergo a more objective sort of scrutiny, are international and filled with immigrants. A random science laboratory is *highly* diverse because the best and the brightest come from all sorts of places.

CaptainFentanyl,,,"If you’re crushing old style OC pills (like we have here in the UK). Then crushed ER is equivalent to IR. 

If you’re crushing new style plastic containing North American ER pills then the IR will hit you harder and the onset of action will be quicker if both doses are equal and both are consumed orally as crushing doesn’t completely defeat the time release of new style OP pills. 

If your tolerance is 60-80mg ER crushed such that he crushing defeats the time release, then 12x 5mg IR should be safe to consume. It will feel exactly the same. 60mg of oxycodone is 60mg of oxycodone. 

If you have new tamper resistant ER pills then they are still partially time release even when crushed, so the 12x 5mg IR would have a more rapid onset of action than the ER and a higher peak plasma concentration (you’ll feel higher at peak and there is the danger of OD, not a great danger but it does exist). 

If your crushed ER pills turns them into IR as they are British/European and just contain wax, talc and colours then both 60mg crushed ER and 60mg IR will have exactly the same effect on you. 

If you’ve got UK/EU OC pills - no difference (crushed ER and IR 60mg will get you to exactly the same place and last the same amount of time 4-6h)

Result: Loss

Streak: **3L**

This one stings a bit differently than other losses. This team was composed was winning at the break and looked the better side. They were at home had this game on lock down and they came out so flat. What hurts the most is it was a POD runner up originally and I originally typed ROMA DNB/+0 as POD, but as I was writing it I felt that Basel was better. Not to throw shade at anyone but once I saw it was a top post in soccerbetting i knew it was doomed. Then when someone who is subscribed to my message service messaged me ""good pick on Basel"" and a screen cap of the 2-0 win from their away match I was like ""Fuck me he has just done the jinx"" 

Moscow scored shortly after to make it 1-1. Then another subscriber said the parlay was looking good and that Basel winner would let him cash Roma ML. Moscow scored again off a horrific defensive error. 

Oh well. That's the game. Champions league record dips to 23-7-12 W-D-L 

We need to get back to winning ways. We're staying in Europe. Unfinished business to attend to. Let's fucking BANG some overs and we gotta get the POD dub in italy that we didn't with Inter and didn't with Roma cause I swapped it for Basel. Let. Us. Go. 

**Third Eye POD: Napoli v Manchester City O 3  (-117)**

Too much talent. Rested players. Both defenses broke in the first leg and it didn't pour over. All studs playing. Napoli has been banging em in at home. City doing it on all fronts. I think we will see an electric affair. Pep has praised this Napoli team as one of the best he's ever seen if not the best. They started slow in the 1H and controlled 2H. 

City have only conceded once in the tournament and it was to Napoli. I think we see both teams score and I think we will see another, but Im not sure if there will be a winner. could see a 2-2 affair. 

Thinking we see a boosted Napoli side at home and this City side is disciplined and great but aren't the best defensively. I like our chances here to get out the rut. 

**side plays**

**Tottenham v Real Madrid O 3 goals (-112)**

If Harry Kane wasn't such a doubt this would be the POD move. Madrid away from home has been better than at home. Less pressure and the historic Wembley arena will bring the best out of this Madrid side. The match was close last time, but this time I see Madrid bringing the fight to Tottenham. This one will be great. 

**Real Madrid ML (+122)**

Yes, please. It's a good price for a team that is still one of the best in world football in a game they will go balls to the walls for. 

**Porto v Leipzig O 2.5 (-111)** 

These teams been leaking in UCL and I think both will score and we will see a winner.

&gt; In his first public remarks since criminal charges were announced over his drive for Catalan independence, Puigdemont condemned the &amp;quot;Violence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Oppression&amp;quot; of Madrid.

&gt; Despite the defiant rhetoric, it was clear that Puigdemont and his allies are on the back foot in the month-long standoff with Madrid, which began when Catalonia pressed ahead with a disputed independence referendum on October 1 and came to a head when the Catalan parliament voted for a unilateral declaration independence last Friday.

&gt; On Monday, as Puigdemont arrived in Brussels, Spain&amp;#039;s chief prosecutor Jose Manuel Maza announced he would seek charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against the ousted leader and several members of his former government.

TulasShorn,,,"&gt; I agree that the IQ numbers at the low end are probably confounded by malnutrition, but this thread didn't discuss genetic potential as far as I can tell, just actual IQ numbers however environmentally confounded, so I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with

I possibly misunderstood your position, but, to be fair, the way you have been posting sure makes it seem like you want to write off a decent chunk of the world's population as irredeemably stupid. Sure, the data is just saying what the IQ numbers are now, but that isn't very useful without considering how drastically those numbers could change with basic interventions. 

&gt; Dysgenic effects could also be fairly significant depending on the different rates of reproduction, and with respect to Bangladesh specifically there is a caste system that can maintain largely distinct but parallel genetic populations for potentially thousands of years, increasing the variance within the country and accounting for the outliers that you cited notwithstanding the dismal averages.

I really doubt that you could see these effects maintaining distinct populations for thousands of years, considering how chaotic history is. Furthermore, Bangladesh is 90% Muslim and does not have a caste system. If there was a rigid caste system at some period in the past, that would mean little room for assortive mating, so I wouldn't imagine that it would select very strongly for intelligence. Lastly, I'm not talking about Bangladeshis or Indians in the US, I have met plently of them from a wide variety of socioeconomic strata in their own countries. 

&gt;  The high end are all whites and East Asians ... two specific races that were successful at colonizing a huge swath of the world precisely because of their unique sophistication.

The reasons for European dominance in the 1700 and 1800s are hugely contentious, complicated, and difficult to determine. I would doubt that IQ is even a third order effect; luck, geography and culture seem more likely to me. It is not as if there have been no empires based built from other ethnic groups; if an alien had come to the planet in 1600, it would have thought that the three dominant cultures were the Ottomans, Mughals, and the Safavids, which are respectively, Turkish, Turko-mongol, and Persian. Various Chinese dynasties have been successfully run by Mongols and Manchus, which makes me think the Han genetics are not so important for the maintenance of the empire. (And I don't really think you can claim Mongols are ""East-Asians"" in the sense that you mean).

&gt; I think on some level you know it because you didn't actually contest the accuracy of what I said, you just huffed and gasped and insulted me a bunch of times.

I didn't bother to contest the accuracy of what you said because it is a terrible comparison. The picture is some peasants or refugees (I don't have any context for the picture), and you are comparing them to the Upper East Side?! Of _course_ the UES has a higher IQ, it is a highly self-selected location for political and financial elites within the US, with enormous barriers to entry. Even if I didn't believe in HBD at all, I would still believe that the UES has a uniquely high IQ, just due to believing IQ is a real thing. A better comparison would be between the picture and some rednecks (peasants) in Mississippi. Why didn't you make that comparison?

Anyhow, you are conflating two different things: silverware and etiquette. Eating a traditional Indian meal doesn't use silverware, but it sure as hell has etiquette. The two concepts are not in any way related. Sure, I can agree that in some broad sense, etiquette (i.e. unwritten rules) tracks class and therefore tracks intelligence. But silverware? Nah.

The type of silverware you use has much more to do with the style of cuisine (or the causality is the other way around, the type of silverware determines the style of cuisine), but either way the difference between leaving your steaks whole or cutting them into small pieces does not seem correlated with etiquette to me.

mostly_helpful,,,"How does that play into your argument? There is a system in CS:GO where players manually review other players behavior and can get them banned for throwing/trolling/griefing. I tried to make a short post but I can address your individual points if you want.

&gt;If this statement is true, then why do threads like this pop up so frequently?

Because people will always cry about everything? Let's break down the post.

&gt;I never heard anyone say that he got banned for anything really except for leaving game.

People get OW griefing bans all the time and complain about them. You heard wrong.

&gt;In cs go however you get some small meaningless cooldown like 30 mins, and you are back to go without much problems.

No, the automatic punishment system for leaving [is escalating](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1203-WJCV-7019). 30 mins-&gt;2 hours-&gt;24 hours-&gt;1 week-&gt;1 week and so on. You need 1 week without any infractions to go down 1 level.

&gt;Not to mention that you can be afk purposefully in game just by moving every once in a while.

Well yeah, but do that enough and you will get OW banned for griefing, which is exactly why a human reviewer is better than an automated system.

&gt;Only solution for this is to kick that player, but still does this punish him or anything ? NOT REALLY.

If you get kicked too many times you get a small cooldown, also see above.

&gt;I know there is a whole new problem in cs go with cheaters and stuff, but still there is far more griefers and trolls, who would pretty much play to lose or tilt you and there is nothing for you to do. Correct me if i m wrong.

Yeah there are, and no system to combat that will ever be perfect. If you play bad on purpose and don't make it super obvious there is nothing that can be done about it in any game. It's literally impossible without a crazy high rate of false positives.

-----

Now for the rest of your post

&gt;Really? Do they? Could you provide some evidence of your statement being true, because I'm 99% they only ban obvious hackers with their overwatch system, and throwers only get a cooldown if they leave, kill their teammates or do nothing.

Yeah, they do. Not instantly of course, the cases still have to go through OW. And as I said, OW definitely handles more than just obvious cheating. And also, besides AFKing, TKing/TAing and obviously just running into the enemies to die, what other methods of throwing exist in CS? Buying shitty guns? I guess that would be the equivalent of making a bad class choice in Overwatch. You can't convict people for that alone, too many false positives.

&gt;Somehow, yet again you've committed the same false equivalence. No detecting cheaters with a demo system is simply not the same as detecting throwers with a demo system, if a demo system was implemented for this feature, the throwers would find ways that circumvent the way they make judgements on who's throwing and who's not, as I said addressing the extremes doesn't help, except for cheating, because cheating is absolute, throwing is a grey-area. You can make multiple arguments/definitions for what is and what is not a thrower, whereas defining and punishing cheating is really simple.

Of course it's a grey area, but in the OW system it's up to the investigators to decide. And as I said, if you really want to you can always throw in any game, it's impossible to prevent the non-obvious cases of it but still important to punish the *obvious* ones.

&gt;Having a team of dedicated staff, making a demo system, making a robust report system that is interlinked with the demo system, setting up servers for the demo process and managing it all is not worth it for anything other than banning cheaters

Wrong because griefing bans exist.

&gt;banning cheaters, which Overwatch seems to have a good handle on, unlike Valve, when they had to implement their overwatch system.

From personal experience in EU matchmaking around LEM I can tell you that the cheating problem in CS:GO is way, way overblown. I can of course only speak for the rank/region I was in, maybe it was worse for others. But I very rarely encountered players that I suspected of possible cheating, just like in OW. And an obvious hacker I've met maybe twice. There are players crying about cheating in 50% of games though. I've been accused countless times myself, it's ridiculous. That being said, I have met more rage hackers in pub games of CS:GO than in Overwatch, that's true. And I didn't play serious comp in CS:GO before OW was implemented, so I can't speak to how it was before that. They do however have an automated system for cheat detection (VAC) which is flawed but it's there. OW is just extra.

&gt;The Valve overwatch system was not made for reviewing cases of throwers, rather reviewing cases of cheaters, but I'm very interested in knowing how the hell you've came to the conclusion that Valve uses their overwatch system for banning trolls, because that simply isn't true.

According to the wiki, Sansa has auburn hair, not red.  
Still, I'll count her as a redhead for the argument.  

Are you following the updates on the research into our Neanderthal genetic past?  
I don't know if you remember when theories were being bruited about red hair being a Neanderthal marker, but that idea has been debunked  
&gt;One of the very first features suggested as having a Neanderthal origin was red hair. A set of Neanderthal genes responsible for both light hair and skin colour was identified by geneticists more than a decade ago and linked to human survival at high latitude, light poor, regions like Europe.
Because the Neanderthals had lived in Europe for several hundred thousand years, it was reasoned that natural selection gave them light skin and hair colour helping to prevent diseases like rickets from occurring.
But as is so often the case in science, the situation is far more complicated than most of us would have imagined. Red hair wasn't inherited from Neanderthals at all. *It now turns out they didn't even carry the gene for it!* 
Red hair is a uniquely human feature, according to a new study by Michael Danneman and Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and published in the The American Journal of Human Genetics.

I got the ac ones at a good price from Amazon UK. (under half price). Last year tho. 

Most of the time prices are way above RRP price. Nintendo UK store sell at RRP, but run out fast plus often limited to one per customer.

I don't know whether Europe would be better. Could check Amazon for each country. 
In the UK Shopto (online), Argos and Symths toys (the latter can be good, seen offers there). 

Frustrating to see that in the US ToysRus have a 3 for 2 offer - I haven't got a store near me &amp; haven't checked online.

To buy in bulk - one of each amiibo probably wouldn't be considered bulk; its many of each amiibo if you want wholesale prices - not sure but would guess sale is official outlets only.
I've not seen good prices on ebay, never with Game. 
PlayAsia look tempting, but they ship from Hong Kong (I think).

This is where the Frankfurt School and the conspiracy of ""cultural Marxism"" comes in - ie the destruction of values, morals, tradition.

By destroying the birth rate via feminism (women no longer having families), as well as war and crises, they've lowered the birth rate to below replacement rates. Their plan is to flood Europe (""turn it black"" as Gaddafi warned) with incompatible non-whites (further reading: Hooton Plan) to create mixed people with zero culture, identity (etc) who can be easily ruled via divide and conquer.

Not exactly true, this is mostly a myth. During the crusades as an instance european armor technology was superior to that of their muslim counterparts, while agricultural and other accomplishment were relatively equal between Europe and the Middle East.

This myth is possibly created due to England being the main ""stereotype"" of the middle aged Europe, England was however relatively poor and a more accurate representation would be the Kingdom of France, republics of Italy and the Byzantine Empire.

To speak in short terms Europe is geographically placed perfectly for imperial advancement, contact to both Asia and Africa not to mention lack of certain natural resources (may seem bad but i'll explain in a moment). The lack of natural resources would give motivation to European expansionism into the south and north Americas, while China might have had the technology for seafaring they had no motivation to pursue it.

 The opening of the Suez Canal enabled European powers to take full advantage of the plentiful resources, cheap labor, and advantageous trade routes along the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. It's hard to overstate the radical impact this had on global trade. As colonial empires gained greater, and greater control of Asian and African lands, they no longer depended on raw materials from the New World. 

As the Western Hemisphere continued to industrialize, there was still a market for U.S. cotton stateside.

&gt;Sirer and others have emphasized that fostering cryptocurrencies could be a means for Russian officials to skirt sanctions. Russia faces US sanctions over the 2012 death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and the country’s intervention in Ukraine and occupation of Crimea. The Magnitsky sanctions froze all US assets of 18 Russian officials accused of human rights abuse; in 2016, it was expanded to include 44 other officials. The US coordinated with the European Union to sanction Russia for its actions in Ukraine in 2014, limiting Russia’s access to financing and the country’s access to using US and European technologies in its financial, energy, and defense sectors, including US-exclusive oil shale extracting technology. Digital currencies could allow Russian officials to electronically send and receive money out of the country and evade the sanctions.

wordsofivory,,,"The game suggests that socialism could create more problems than it fixes. That ideas like universal healthcare come with their own set of problems.

The idea is that, if taken to its extreme limits, universal health care could leave people worse off in the long with. For one, it would also create a much larger demand for medication than there is a supply of it. The huge financial burden could potentially cripple a country's economy by eating into other important resources. People would be left poor due to crippling taxes, lack of sustainable jobs, etc. 

We already see this in effect in Europe. An increasingly growing population of older people who can't work or provide necessary labour due to age, and are putting a huge financial and resource burden on the economy due to medical care. We literally don't have the staff or money to look after so many people.

Just to provide an example based on what I mentioned above, in recent months I have gone to my pharmacy to pick up heart medication (which I need to stay alive), and increasingly been told that they have a shortage of it. They literally can't make the medication fast enough. ""Generic"" medication has helped to alleviate the problem somewhat, but the longer people are able to live, the worse this problem is going to get.

It isn't just a fantastical idea. It's existing reality, right now.

Even if you don't agree 100% with those ideas, it still sounds like an interesting setting for a game, right? Nope, apparently it's a GamerGate wet dreams and that makes the developer scum as a result.

Yes it absolutely does. It is a verifiable fact that German and English are more closely related than English and Japanese. Merely declaring that this is a baseless claim, with no explanation given whatsoever, does nothing to prove you right, or me wrong.

&gt;Not being able to speak or understand English is a huge barrier no matter what the primary language is. Be it Tagalog, Hindi, German, Russian, even French sometimes.

Right, and it's *less* of a barrier to someone who grew up learning English in their national schools, and whose mother tongue is so closely related to English that many words are interchangeable.

This idea that it's an equally large barrier for all immigrants is verifiably incorrect.

&gt;I'd even pose a counter argument in saying that it's easier to find translators for Asian languages than European ones due to our diverse population base.

This also doesn't change the fact that English and German are more closely related than English and Japanese. Simply declaring this to be a baseless claim doesn't make it so if you can't explain *why* it's a baseless claim.

&gt;Also the differences in the importance of family and how they treat and view their elderly (who are more likely to not understand English at all).

The current state of the Brexit negotiations suggests that the UK *may* default to WTO tariffs (hence the ""fails to agree a Brexit deal"" bit in the headline).

This would have at least two serious implications for fruit and vegetable production and sale as I see it:

1) the current regime is friendly to growers looking for Eastern and Southern European labour - anything that makes it harder to employ such labour, or makes it harder for employees to enter the country, will result in a diminished ability to harvest (and there's a 29% shortfall in supply of labour already this year and growers are feeling it)

2) fruit and vegetable production operates on extremely small margins - all the value is at the retail end - so tariffs could exterminate British exports (and yes, we do export a little).

&gt; A lei trabalhista deve ser modificada para que os acordos bilaterais se sobrepon- ham aos direitos atuais. Ou seja, trabalhador passa a ter o direito de renunciar aos benefícios desde que aceite a negociação e que os direitos humanos constitucio- nais sejam respeitados.

Eles definitivamente são uma força polarizadora que acaba acentuando ainda mais as atuais divisões do país e a ultrapassada guerra de direita vs esquerda.

An in those thousands of years the Aborigines basically invented nothing compared to the progress of the rest of the world. Africans back then were making way better stuff than them.

I'm not saying they're useless but back in the old days when people would sail the seas and invade other people's territory it was up to the inhabitants to defend their territory and the Aborigines did a shit job at it. At least the Maoris put up a good fight and there wasn't even as many as the Aborigines.

And who killed Captain Cook? An even smaller group of inhabitants.

That was the way it was back then. They were lucky they weren't wiped out completely and no-one in this day and age should be apologising for something that had nothing to do with them when the times have changed just because they are the same skin colour.

There really isn't any big secret beyond this.

So my local church stops being a sacred site whenever no one is praying in there?  Either way, things can be sacred places without having anyone worship there, ever. That's not a necessary requirement.

Maybe that's all it is to you, but other people see it differently. Once again, listen to what other people say about their own beliefs and culture.

N0handles,,,"While most people laughed at the ""pickle rick"" scene in Season 3 of the Rick and Morty TV series, few people actually understood it. Me, on the other hand, with my 200 IQ (that's right, my IQ is 200), am fully equipped with the mental tools needed to dissect the ""pickle rick"" scene in time to chuckle whilst watching it occur. No, I did not have to pick apart and analyze the scene, watching it over and over again, to understand the scene's true meaning. In fact, I knew Rick would be in pickle form immediately when Morty walked into the garage. BAM! Just like that, my brain calculated why the scene was funny and the true joke that was intended. Most people know very little about history, it's unfortunate, but that's just how it is nowadays. What, with the education system being so bad. Ahahaha. Dummies.  No offense, you guys are just retarded. I mean, it's not like I'm trying to insult you, but you were just raised this way. Raised to be inferior to me. Do not fret, I hold you in ABSOLUTELY no contempt. Let's get back to the meat of the argument. So, history lesson, there was once a philosopher called Aristotle. He was like Plato, but more practical. Oh, and Plato, he was a philosopher too. Philosophers are people who think about the world. Do you know what that means? To think about the world? I wonder if you can. I truly do, do not worry pleb, this is mere constructive criticism, it is not intended as an insult towards you.  You being inferior is OKAY, it is okay that you are inferior, not everyone can be as intelligent as me. Aside from my education (I'm a Harvard graduate, FYI), I was born with a 200 IQ. I wonder if you can even remember having read that I was born with a 200 IQ or if it's already exited your little brain. ANYWAYS, so, now we have established the concept of philosophers in your little pea brain. Philosophers = people who think about things. So, Plato, Aristotle. Both philosophers from the Roman Empire. Let's move forward in time a bit, yes, yes, let's move ALL THE WAY INTO THE 19th/20th century! So here we are. There's a hip new philosopher whose name is Nietzsche. So, if you've ever read Nietzsche you'll know he's a nihilist. Nihilism means ""the world has no purpose"", essentially. Nietzsche believed the world had no purpose. I have studied him for 10 years now at Princeton, it's such a nice school! I've had sex with tons of women during my stay there, women at places like that are attracted to big brain guys like me. It's just how it is, sorry chap. SO nihilism = no meaning in the world. This was groundbreaking for the time, prior to this, religion had ruled over the world. Christianity had dominated Europe, and everyone was obsessed with ""meaning"", ba! ""meaning"", what is that!? Hahahahaha, what a absolutely bizarre concept. Unfortunately, before Nietzsche could finish his philosophy he died of an STD, how dreadful! This was one of the single most troublesome things I had ever discovered in my life, second only to the fact that there are others out there with 201 IQs. Probably lying, probably cheated on their tests. Do you remember that we were talking about Rick and Morty pleb? Well, anyways, the ""pickle rick"" scene is what I consider to be the culmination of Nietzsche's work. I laughed, I laughed so hard at that scene because I was so happy, and I laughed because I realized how pointless the culmination of Nietzsche's work was anyways. Why had that concerned me so? Why had I cared so much about Nietzsche's work? The world truly has no meaning, few can actually come to this realization, but I did. If you had an IQ of 200, maybe you would too!

Superbuddhapunk,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"How many new staff will Whitehall have to recruit to deal with the challenge of Brexit? The question is one that ministers have long been coy about answering, but in the past few days some new detail has finally started to emerge.

Britain’s decision to leave means that thousands more officials will be needed in a range of areas, most notably customs and immigration control, where the UK is entering a new relationship with the EU. This inevitably imposes a challenge on public finances. Here is a rough guide to what we now know about the staffing expansion across Whitehall.

HM Revenue &amp; Customs

The government announced this week that it will need up to 5,000 more customs officers in the event that there is “no deal” with the EU. This will cost up to £450m. But even if there is a more benign outcome to the Brexit negotiations, Britain’s departure from the single market and customs union would bring a significant increase in customs declarations and a need for more staff.

Home Office 

The UK is currently employing 1,200 extra immigration case workers (plus 300 border staff) to register the 3m EU nationals currently living in the UK who will want a long-term right to remain. 

There is still a big unknown, however. How much will the Home Office’s Visa and Immigration unit have to expand permanently to deal with new immigration controls post-2019? At present, the unit employs 6,500 officials who process visa applications from non-EU nationals. This number will have to expand significantly when EU citizens face similar restrictions to those in non-EU states.

Dexeu, DIT and other departments in Whitehall 

Much of the staff for the Department for Exiting the EU and the Department for International Trade come on secondment from other ministries. But at least 3,000 extra staff have also been recruited from outside Whitehall to help implement Brexit. These include specialists in finance, accountancy, digital services, project management and trade negotiation. According to an FT report last month, the government admits there will be a further wave of hiring as Britain gets close to exit day in March 2019. 

Regulatory agencies

There are no fewer than 34 EU regulatory bodies that cover a wide range of sectors from life sciences to medicine to financial services. We do not yet know whether the UK will set up new agencies to regulate these areas on a UK-only basis, or whether Britain will continue to shadow EU law in some sectors. Those that see a clean break from the EU could see a need for many more regulators. 

The big picture

All told, we are some way from knowing how big the overall recruitment drive will be. A claim made last year in a report by Deloitte — that Brexit will see Britain needing to recruit 30,000 officials — looks far-fetched. But it is hard to see the final figure for extra Whitehall staff coming in under 10,000-15,000. Recruiting and training these officials at speed will be a major challenge for departments.

Hard numbers

The Bank of England has raised expectations to such a high level that it will increase interest rates for the first time in 10 years on Thursday that any decision to do nothing would prompt a significant shock in financial markets. Kallum Pickering, UK economist at Berenberg, says the chances of the central bank keeping interest rates at their 0.25 per cent historic low are “incredibly small”.

But if the immediate decision appears a foregone conclusion in the City of London, the BoE’s rate-setting committee still has many big questions to answer about its reasoning, the UK’s economic prospects, and how the bank communicates the future outlook for interest rates.",True,0,1509539441,,False,0,dp6pdl9,True,t3_7a38u5,t3_7a38u5,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/7a38u5/the_brexit_headcount_begins_to_balloon/dp6pdl9/,1512012713,11,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,public,

czokletmuss,,USA is a cancer on this planet,"&gt;Kobe Steel has admitted to falsification over the past year relating to large quantities of four types of material; 19,300 tonnes of aluminium sheets and poles; 19,400 aluminium components; 2,200 tonnes of copper products and an unspecified amount of iron powder that was supplied to over 200 customers. These items were certified as having properties—such as a level of tensile strength, meaning stiffness—that they did not in fact possess.

&gt;No deaths or accidents have yet resulted, but the firm’s products are used by a long list of household names in Japan and overseas. **Companies ranging from Boeing, Ford and GM of America to Hitachi, Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan are rushing to examine their products’ safety. Mitsubishi has already said that affected steel was used in an H-2A rocket that safely launched a global-positioning satellite into orbit on October 10th.**

&gt;Replacing the faulty metal sold may initially cost Kobe Steel just ¥15bn, according to J.P. Morgan, a bank. Yet taking into account the need to idle and repair any affected cars and planes, the overall cost could soar. More revelations may be on the way, for Kobe Steel admits that its current problems stretch back at least a decade.

&gt;The news has come at the worst possible moment. Like the rest of its industry in the rich world, Kobe Steel has been hit by a flood of cheap aluminium and steel imports. In 2016 it lost ¥23bn. In order to compete, mills will have to produce the sort of high-tech steel for cars, planes and trains that still commands premium prices, says Wolfgang Eder of Voestalpine, one of the few steel firms in Europe that is still profitable.

DoctorWhoSeason24,,,"&gt; Como alguém que ganha 30 mil paga a mesma porcentagem que alguém que ganha 5.

Simples: não paga. 

Quase ninguém paga efetivamente 27,5%. A tabela do IR é progressiva, o que significa que você só paga aquela alíquota sobre a parte do teu dinheiro que ultrapassar o patamar.

Vou dar exemplo usando a tabela que você trouxe. Se você começa a pagar 27,5% acima de 4700, a pessoa que ganha 5000 só paga 27,5% sobre 300 reais, 22,5% sobre 950 reais (4700 - 3750, o próximo item da tabela), 15% sobre outros 950 (3750 - 2800), 7,5% sobre 900 (2800-1900), e nada (0%) sobre os primeiros 1900.

Assim, o cidadão que ganha 5000 paga R$ 505,64 reais de IR. Pouco mais de 10%.

Por outro lado, a pessoa que ganha 30 mil paga 27,5% sobre R$ 25.300,00, e o resto do cálculo é o mesmo. No total, essa pessoa paga R$ 7380,64 de IR, ou seja, quase 25%.

Para facilitar esse cálculo (afinal, se você ganha acima de determinado patamar, o imposto que você paga sobre os patamares de baixo é sempre valor fixo) é que existe aquela tabela de ""valor a deduzir"" logo ao lado. Assim, você aplica o percentual mais alto de IR sobre o total do teu ganho, e subtrai aquela parcela para descobrir o valor total de IR que vai pagar. Foi assim que eu fiz os dois cálculos aqui de cima.

Isso serve tanto para evitar a injustiça de pessoas com renda desigual pagarem a mesma porcentagem, quanto para evitar a situação de ser mais vantajoso ganhar menos (se o percentual fosse fixo, seria muito melhor ter um salário de R$ 4664,65 e pagar 22,5% do que ter um aumento de 5 centavo para passar a pagar 27,5% sobre tudo)",True,0,1509541102,,False,0,dp6qflx,False,t3_7a2j44,t1_dp6ppkw,/r/brasil/comments/7a2j44/mp_que_tributa_fundos_atinge_famílias_mais_ricas/dp6qflx/,1512013346,11,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,public,

On 2 April the talks came to a conclusion and a press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight parties had reached an agreement on a framework deal. The parties announced, ""Today, we have taken a decisive step: we have reached solutions on key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,"" which they intended to complete by 30 June.

lelarentaka,,,"&gt;every country defines urban differently

Of course. But how do you think that would affect my argument?

&gt; you will find that the US is much less densely populated than Germany and most of Western Europe.

Again with this argument. In the topic of this thread, the factor that we are interested in is the [[Mean distance between people and hospital]]. But this measure is a bit circular, because a full-sized full-equipped hospital needs some number of people to be profitable, so really what we're measuring is [[Mean distance between people to people]] (abrevv. MDBPtP). This is a different metric from the simple population density that you're thinking off, which is simply [[population / land area]].

Just to give an example, countries like Egypt, Libya and Algeria has a low [[population density]], but they have very high MDBPtP because 99% all of their people are on the coast of the Mediterranean and the Nile. [See the data here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country)

Urbanization is a convenient proxy of MDBPtP, because the data is more widely available. When we're trying to make assessments about penetration of government services for example, MDBPtP is far more meaningful than simple population density. The fact that Algeria has a desert hinterland the size of fucking Alaska is irrelevant, because nobody lives there. For most intents and purposes (calculating average travel time maybe?), Algeria is effectively a fairly densely populated country, as reflected by its 73% urbanization score.

ND nu a fost dat afara din partid. A plecat singur in ciuda numeroaselor apeluri de a nu face asta si a decis sa ramana plecat pana cand ""se va face pohta ce-a pohtit"" . Adica s-a comportat ca un copil razgaiat. Asta nu e comportament de sef de partid, e comportament de mic dictator

Opinia respectata nu inseamna aplicarea acelei opinii.

Nu, partidul a fost facut de el si de multi altii, cei mai multi fiind cei care formeaza acum conducerea partidului. Dar discursul tau indica aceeasi nevoie de tatuc salvator pe care o vad si la votantii PSD.

La alegerile astea s-a votat doar presedintele. Restul conducerii partidului a ramas cea votata in vara cand a castigat si ND sefia partidului. Dar evident atunci era OK ca erau prietenii. Acum nu mai sunt ca...logica

Sorry pillow dude killed the vibe.  Was it the first time Dustin came or just a month ago?  Please let me know if you see that type of crap happening - seems like you know who I am - it pains me and the rest of our team as much as it does you, when someone's keeping people from catching the groove.  Especially with someone like Dustin playing.

Experiencing places like Oath and Air, or Good Room in NYC (/warehouse parties there) was a big part of what made us want to open a club.  Dance culture and electronic music culture is newer here and has less roots (you could say 'behind'), and for a while it's been run and sustained largely by expats, though this is finally changing - that's a whole other topic.  But it also means that people, especially locals, are often really open, compared to Europe or Japan where tastes have settled already into a particular sound they can go out to hear regularly, or they can stick to whatever's trendy, because they're lucky to live in a scene with that much depth of choice and development.  It's a double-edged sword - I count myself lucky to live in a place where there's still a sense of discovery - not just of some artists, but of whole genres - and where you can actually see and feel the scene growing.

Saw Dixon play at Womb two years ago and had a great night - forgetting the rankings crap, he's worked incredibly hard on DJing for a long time and it comes through in how he plays.  Sad he'll be playing on a rough sound system here, I'd be more optimistic about having him convert some of the #1-crazed people for whom money isn't an object to like better music if at least the details of what he plays were audible. 

Sad also hear you feel like ALL and Elevator are places for expat gathering more than music.  Do you go to them often?  ALL is almost entirely local crowds from what I've seen/heard, and the last four-five months at Elevator it's often mostly Chinese or half-half until the last few hours of the night.  There are definitely still plenty of expats, but it's a far cry from Lola before, for example (the only place consistently booking 4/4 dance stuff) where you'd be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of Chinese people hanging out.  

Nice shout-out for Oath, that place is so nice.  Though the last two times I went, it was full of wasted foreign students at first, finally about 6-7am it went back to the lovely vibe it had before - heard this has happened since it was written up as the 'best small club in the world' in some major English media... Tokyo has an amazing culture for dance music, record stores, etc, built up gradually since the early nineties (or even before).  I had the same impression as you, that the scene is really thriving based on the depth of talent and appreciation, though sadly when you talk to Japanese DJs and promoters there's another story - things have been in a decline for 7-8 years now.  With an ageing population and a younger generation less interested in underground clubbing, more and more incredibly talented artists are struggling to get bookings - or when they get booked, people don't go out to see them, because the Wombs and the Contacts and the Vents are pushing so many big foreign names all the time.  They tend to see Shanghai as a really healthy and energetic little scene, and growing, when they visit.

About Japanese artists, Kuniyuki just played at Concrete &amp; Grass, Nobu played Shelter two years ago (hoping he can come back soon, but he's gotten pretty hard to book), Giles has been here at least a few times.  Besides Muro there's been Sisi, Takashi Himeoka, Kikiorix, DJ Koco, Kaoru Inoue, Calm and Que Sakamoto, with Chee Shimizu, DJ Masda, 77 Karat Gold (Grooveman Spot and Sauce81), Sinob Satosi and Shintaro.D coming up.  

Seems your taste runs to house and techno, did you catch San Proper or Tim Sweeney, Mood Hut, Einzelkind, Ulf Eriksson, Truncate or Timothy J Fairplay in the last few months?  If you're into Romanian sounds and you're in town, come to micro/wave this Friday (the INIT crew from Tokyo playing) or Sonja Moonear on the 17th - find me for a drink and a pillowfight.  There's also Xhin, Kornel Kovacs, Samo DJ, Zaltan, Oskar Offermann, The Zenker Brothers and Antenes coming up.

India has no interest in Pakistan. India doesn't seriously have an interest even in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simla_Agreement - this was basically a ""the LOC is now the border between India and Pakistan, we've no interest in POK"".

How many terrorist organisations operate in India to launch attacks on Pakistan? How many terrorist organisations are funded by the Government of India or the military of India? 

Why would India bother with Pakistan, a rabid nation with an unpredictable policy on its nuclear arms? It's nonsensical to even entertain the idea.

Also, cross border strike were the result of TWO attacks by terrorists, housed in Pakistan, against India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Pathankot_attack and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Uri_attack.

The exact same happened in Burma - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Indian_counter-insurgency_operation_in_Myanmar - when Maoists killed 18 Indian Army soldiers - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Manipur_ambush

Cross border strikes are not ""stunts"". When a nation is housing and funding terrorists who are using your nation as a training camp and launch pad to attack India, what do you expect them to do? Keep taking it?

If the US suffered repeated terrorists attacks from Mexicans terrorists funded by the Mexican Government and housed by the Mexican Government and trained in Mexico, what would you expect them to do? Keep taking it? 

Goddamn, if anything India has shown restraint. ISIS commit terrorist attacks in Europe, European nations start bombing the hell out of Syria and Iraq thus causing immense disruption. Al-Qaeda take down the Twin Towers, the US goes on to invade Afghanistan, fuck shit up and stick around for a good 16+ years with no end in sight. 

India is an incredibly mature nation. In '47, they called for the United Nations to maintain a ceasefire. In 1965, they were winning the war, thought it utterly fruitless to continue and were the ones who pushed for peace. In 1971, they split up Pakistan, achieved their objectives and called for peace agreement and return of 90-100,000 Pakistani POWs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war_during_the_Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971. In 1999, India did not cross the Line of Control, kicked all the Pakistanis out and called for peace. This is DESPITE each and everytime Pakistan causing the agitations (in '71, Pakistan committing genocide against Bangladeshis, a good 200,000+ ethnically cleansed)

It's very rare that a player would be from the same city, let alone the state, of his current team. 

Like you said though, these players decided to represent and live in London now so they deserve the support just off that.

Valerie_Monroe,,Muskeljudentum,"That's a real stretch, not only because of the 200 year gap between the movements but also because the core of the Reformation was theological. From the very start was a rejection of Papal authority and the belief that every individual could be their own priest rather than submit to church authority.

The origins of the Reform movement were largely *aesthetic* in 1800's, with the goal of trying to make Judaism more of a mainstream European religion by adding things like bell towers and choirs to temples, but none of the disputes were theological and they still followed halacha. This was a response to the changing social status of Jews in Germany, not from any specific (or 95 specific issues like Luther) grievance against Jewish institutions. [The main protest against the first Reform temple in Hamburg was that they were 'emulating the gentiles,'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Temple_disputes) but there was nothing akin to Luther's overt rejection of core Catholic tenets. 

The Reform movement was little more than a new coat of paint for almost a hundred years until controversies like the Trefa Banquet in 1883 forced both Orthodoxy and Reform to double down and move closer to modern Reform Judaism. Even the questioning of traditional rabbinic authority wasn't considered for several decades after its founding.

Jooana,,,"&gt; I know but you need more boundaries than that, something that extent to cult (like the WBC) or nazis.

Why? You haven't explained yet why, except you believe you should have the right to control others' people speech as long as you disagree with it enough. 

&gt;
The problem is that you don't really believe that work like that in reality. Try to convince some scientology members that his religion is bullshit, sure it's easily proven that it is but you won't succeed. You know the problem when you claim that climate change isn't real, some people believe it because it's easier, no matter that 99% of the scientists think otherwise and most of people are really certain about the arguments for the reality of climate change. Anyway, better speech doesn't work in post-truth era like we are now. Better speechs are just not listened. Climate change deniers, anti-vaxx and other stupid people are not that big a deal normally (if people who have the power like the US president doesn't believe that, which is not the case right now)

People like you are far more dangerous than scientologists or anti-vaxxers will ever be. You're an unhinged fanatic, even if you have no conscience of it. And the fact you want to ban speech because you don't trust the ability of good speech to counter bad speech only reveals how you believe to be yourself vulnerable to those ideas. 

At the end of the day, Nazis rose in a society with the most advanced hate laws in existence. Just like communism rose in Germany, then Russia. The US, with the 1st Amendment, never had any problem with totalitarianism and never will - because bad ideas become more attractive when people don't have faith they can be fought with speech and start trying to put them down with laws. Dangerous people like you.

&gt;Far-right conspiracies work on some people and when you convince people that ""liberals"" are subhuman and deserved to die, you can't protect yourself behind the 1st amendment when one of your follower actually killed one. You have blood on your hand too. Should we agree on that ? Should we punish him for his sort of speech or can the speaker continue to spit his hate ?

Funny how obsessed you are with the far-right and how anti-American you are. Are you a far-left extremist? Normally only far-left and far-right types have such an unbalanced partisan view.

Also, I've already referred to you to the answer to your questions:
&gt;Check Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire and Brandenburg v. Ohio, for example. Or look up ""fighting words"".

 You said ""I know"". Turns out you don't? If you do know, why are you asking that? 

&gt;I think it applies in my example. If unresponsible freedom of speech kills, that's a pretty big interference on the freedom of the victim.

Let me guess: you get to decide what is ""unresponsible freedom fo speech"". If you agree with that particular speech, then it becomes censorship. 

&gt;close
&gt;Trump doesn't just want to deport them, he wants to build a huge wall too and what about the ""muslim ban"" ?

Pew Center numbers are just another estimate and they're one of the lowest one. So between 11 million and 13 million.

Also, it's November 2017 and you're still saying ""Muslim ban""? It's a temporary visa restriction on a few countries - including some like Venezuela and North Korea, while the vast majority of Muslim countries are left out. It's not a ban, just means getting a Visa is more complicated. And it's temporary. And it applies to everyone in those countries regardless of religion. And not all of those countries are Muslim as I explained. And yet you call it a ""Muslim ban""? What were you saying about ""conspiracies working on some people""? Perhaps you fell prey to one?

&gt;I don't think we're more restrictive on immigration but that's an other topic and that doesn't really matter, my point was just we don't kill people trying to cross our borders.

Again, there are million of illegal immigrants that Trump wants to legalize. In Europe, not even the most pro-immigration governments are proposing such a thing. The truth is that Trump is even to the right of the Sweddish green on immigration issues. It's just Europeans appropriate the rhetoric of the American left without even realizing that the American right is way to the left of the European left.

And it is exacerbating the generally polarized global atmosphere, which is a result of certain crisises facing the western world. 

In the states, in Presidential Elections the winner of (almost all) states get the totality of its electoral votes. This encourages to form wider and wider blocs to cover as big part of the opinions of the electorate as possible. Ultimately it ends in two competing candidates, because if either splits their votes to two, it causes the ""other side"" to win and receive all of the electoral votes. Same process it at work in Senate elections and in House elections: that is, first past the post wins everything. When it is 1vs1, things polarize quickly. 

As a comparison, if the election system was proportional, it encourages smaller candidates and bigger variety of ideas. This lessens polarization. A good comparative stat is to look at European continental nations: they are polarized, because of the global developments, but less so than the US, thanks to the different political systems that don't encourage polarization via bipartisanism.",True,0,1509547145,,False,0,dp6v5pf,False,t3_7a18w8,t1_dp6crx9,/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/7a18w8/what_is_causing_such_intense_polarization_and/dp6v5pf/,1512016057,1,False,AskThe_Donald,t5_3fuwj,public,

The criticism of Bose is based on his alliance with Nazis and Imperial Japan. Which was problematic within the context of his time. You're confusing giving Bose the benefit of hindsight with presentism. And assuming Bose was unaware of Nazi and Axis atrocities is in itself problematic.

&gt;after research, pretty objectively

Research by who? What books did you read?

&gt;divisive Mughal ruler 

Divisive right now in popular history. We won't easily know how he was perceived by the general populace during his reign. Emotional narratives and myths made after the fact or even hagiographies are not very helpful.

&gt;screw-up the Empire he stole from his father.

He expanded the mughal empire to it's greatest extent, so from his PoV he did quite well. Mughal and Mongol succession often involved wars and killing - if you read about it you would see that. Again, read books not selective quotes out of context, or nutjobs with an agenda that aren't even historians. Kings and Queens were by and large self serving individuals who did everything they could to expand their territory, power, wealth and fame. Rulers like Akbar were exceptions for the most part.

&gt;incite several religious rebellions against him which he then proceeded to decimate. 

Which is very normal for Kings around the world during his era. Benevolent kings are an exception, not the rule. It's completely normal for Kings to brutally put down any rebellion. And the idea that he would intentionally incite rebellions is odd - why would he do that? Most of the rebels wanted to cement their own power, to think they were fighting for ""hindus"" is oversimplifying things.

&gt;He was pretty intolerant, as evidenced by the several temples he definitely did destroy as well as re-imposition of jiziya

[Read this interview with Richard Eaton](http://www.tehelka.com/2013/11/its-a-myth-that-muslim-rulers-destroyed-thousands-of-temples/)

Jizya was a 0.5-6% tax imposed on non-muslims, and it primarily affected rich Hindu nobility who were naturally upset. But if you look at the treatment of minorities in a similar time frame around the world a tax is a laughable example of oppression if you read about the Spanish Inqusition, the treatment jews and muslims faced in Europe, and what was happening in the middle east. 

[More here](https://scroll.in/article/752358/was-aurangzeb-the-most-evil-ruler-india-has-ever-had)

Was he worse than Akbar? Yes obviously. Was he much worse than most other kings and queens during his time? Unlikely, and that's the point historians try to make.

&gt;cruel treatment of the Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur. 

Most kings dealt with rebels brutally. That's why the world moved away from monarchies.

&gt;""Destruction of Temples"" in ""The Oxford history of India

A book from the early 20th century that calls hindus hindoos is not going to be a great source. There has been tons of research on the subject, and there has been lots of technological advancements that made looking into history easier. If ""marxist historians"" (whatever that means) aren't your cup of tea, try Richard Eaton or Audrey Truschke. For the most part the label of marxist historian is used to dismiss anybody that isn't some kind of nutjob hack like Koenrad Elst, Rajiv Malhotra or any one of the crazies hindutvavadis like.

&gt;Example of what I mean: 

Selectively quoted texts from a redditor is not a good source. FWIW I don't see any glorification or white washing there either. If you cherrypick one side of the story it's not too helpful.

&gt;Democrats-BLM-Antifa whining

Slavery was abolished in 1833 but african americans have been victims of racial apartheid and Jim Crow up until the 60s. The civil rights movement was from 1954–1968. That's far more recent than 400 years ago with Aurangzeb, or 1000 years ago with Turkic invaders. African Americans are *still* victims of instituinalized racism, and that's what BLM is about. A handful of BLM activists that get violent doesn't represent the entire movement. KKK otoh is murderous and supremacist by design, BLM is not.

So, African Americans are still an underprivileged group in America so obviously they are going to talk about police shootings where innocent black people get killed. 

How is this in any way equivalent to a Muslim king who ruled 400 years ago? Are Hindus still oppressed?

&gt;the natives still do cry about the Americans

Because they are underprivileged and up until very recently were the victims of atrocities. They still face lots of discrimination.

&gt;Half the colonial world still cribs about the Brits.

Nowhere near the level of tears India regularly flood the internet with. South East Asia definitely doesn't, China rarely whinges about their suffering under the British. Islamists do, and even with them their anger is directed towards post WW1 20th century
intervention by the West. 

&gt;BJP is both anti-elitist, but also a suit-boot ki sarkar

It's not hard to get if you think about it. RW populist demagogues and oligarchies seek to enrich themselves, their donors and their friends while trying to spread the message that they speak for the ""little guy"". Republicans have been experts at this, and so is Trump. They want to ""drain the swamp"" by appointing Wall street execs, and they constantly rail on about the ""globalist elite"" while scam-artists like Trump laugh all the way to the bank. Economic nationalism is now an alt-right favorite.

Modi, the BJP and RSS seek to enrich a certain kind of homegrown elite - people like Ramdev, the Adanis, Ambanis and additionally certain sections of the Indian trader communities and castes. That's the ""suit boot"", and the anti-elitist stance is directed towards the elite that doesn't support the BJP. Kind of like how when Trump says ""elite"" he talks about ""rich democrats that don't like me"".

&gt;Remember Rajivji brought computers? 

Eh how is bringing computers a bad thing? Garibi hatao and the green revolution weren't necessarily about targeting the 'aspirational class', they were for the poor. The BJP wants to convince slum dwellers that they can all make it big. It's substantially different to advocate for reducing poverty. BJP specifically targets the aspirational class, and this is right out of the right wing populist playbook. Left parties generally target the poor, whether they are successful or not they aren't really about the nouveau riche.

&gt;You know this actually describes Leftist leaders like Corbyn and Sanders

Anti-elite sentiments have been pushed out of the mainstream left, and no neither Corbyn or Sanders are anywhere close to the virulent anti-elite attitudes Trump espouses. Neither are anarchists or anywhere close to communists or naxals. Sanders is not really too far off from the European center.

&gt;groups like Antifa and BLM violently protesting against ""elite symbols"" like banks and Starbucks

These are irrelevant fringe groups that receive virtually zero support from Democrats or the wider public. This is exactly like denouncing feminism because some tumblr idiot wants to identify as a dolphin, or some lunatic wants to be transblind. If you want BLM and Antifa explained in greater detail try a few US political subs, reddit talks about this all the time. The Allies in WW2 were anti-fascist, what's wrong with that?

&gt;BJP is better on this front though, imo.

There is hardly any difference between the NDA and UPA in terms of economics. Both follow heavily pro-poor policies, extensive subsidies and gradual neo-liberal reforms. Corruption isn't really a part of economic ideology but on the ground little has changed. 

&gt;And they have been pretty great with restraining the fiscal deficit and not going bat-shit insane like PC in the dying years of UPA-2.

When there is an economic downturn the government needs to spend more to keep the economy on track right? UPA2 was roughly when the global financial crisis happened, work from there to understand why deficits were the way they were. And of course look at changes in global oil prices.

and this - http://www.hindustantimes.com/union-budget/what-the-modi-government-is-not-telling-you-about-the-economy/story-DjwntuF78QebQmre8LwMnK.html

High government spending is completely normal and a GOOD thing for a developing country. Obviously this doesn't mean borrowing till you go bankrupt or hiring people to dig ditches and refill them or whatever. The USA and the UK had gigantic govt spending post WW2 and that's why there are where they are. China is doing the same thing right now. If they cared too much about fiscal deficits they would be nowhere.


&gt;There's no active conspiracy against the Taj Mahal.

But multiple BJP politicians and Yogi Adityanath talk about it. It's been an ongoing obsession with the Sangh for years. The Ram Mandir idiocy is exactly the same core concept.

&gt;Marxist historiography does have problems and inherent biases, which you are completely dismissing. The historians you mentioned aren't completely objective.

I didn't even ask you to read Romila Thapar or Irfan Habib. Look up Richard Eaton or Audrey Trushke, they are much more accessible, easier to read and they don't have any political bias like an Indian author might (if that worries you). Marxist historian is a buzzword used by the Parivar to dismiss any historian that doesn't care for their revisionism. All Marxist history means is looking at history through the eyes of ordinary individuals. That doesn't by itself make it wrong.

Edit: Here's some source that isn't a google search of ""Turkish People"" and nitpicking the pictures that conform your weird assumption.

But to be more precise as to why all Turks doesn't look middle eastern. Turkish people are originally from Asia, [this part to be exact](https://evolutionistx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/1024px-linguistic_map_of_the_mongolic_languages.png). After Turks came to Anatolia in 1071 they started to mix with the local population they conquered which includes Europeans, and Arabs and other ethnic people. as they moved towards west.

Turks in history has always gone to the west due to their ancient religion; a type of shamanism, because they believe in going towards where the sun sets.

For example, I'm Turkish and my mother's side immigrated from Albania back to Turkey after the Balkan wars. My Father's side has a similar story from Greece after WW1. Both sides have Turkish roots.

&gt; To this end EU has listed more than 90 legal acts in their position paper that have been to used to calculate UK financial obligations.

The position paper came later still.  It's dated 12 June 2017.  Again, there is no scope for negotiation over content, only over methodology.

I've seen that position paper before.  The two annexes are as good as useless because they're only the left-hand side of the invoice: the UK has no idea what each Act costs and therefore cannot begin to guess at what it will all add up to.

From that position paper:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Through its approval of the successive Multiannual Financial Frameworks (MFFs) and the Own Resource Decision (ORD), the United Kingdom committed to fund a share of the Union obligations defined by the ORD rules in all its dimensions.

To understand this disagreement, it is essential to understand the difference between a long term budget forecast (the MFF), an annual budget and the monies that actually materialise, and also who approves each.

A budget is not a guarantee.  If it were, it would be called a liability.  The MFF is a very loose forecast of the monies that might be available over the 7 year period but, since budget contributions are calculated principally on each member state's GDP and VAT takings, the actual contributions vary year by year.  When recession hits, contributions reduce proportionately.

It is impossible to forecast accurately revenues 7 years out, so there is and never has been any expectation that the MFF would translate into annual budgets exactly as forecast.  That's why [Council Regulation 1311/2013](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32013R1311) Art. 17 provides for mid-period revisions of the MFF to cope with what Art. 17 calls ""exceptional circumstances"".

I would say that Brexit qualifies as an exceptional circumstance but, to my knowledge no Art. 17 revision taking into account the effects of Brexit has been made despite having been made aware *at least* since 24 June 2016, nearly 3 years as it turns out, that the MFF would likely be impacted.

Annual budgets set an upper limit on what the Commission *may* spend, but it does not require that it spends its *full* budget — and any prudent financial controller would rein in spending if there was a realistic prospect that there would not be sufficient money to cover the budget, and thus limit commitments it might have trouble paying for.

Both the MFF and the annual budget requires Council unanimity and assent from the EU Parliament.  Any member state can veto either but, if they do, they will have to explain why and what it will take to win their approval.

Unless the UK assents to some MFF or other, the EU breaks down and nobody, not even the UK, would see such disruption as justifiable.  And yet, as early as 2013 when the 2014-2020 MFF was being drawn up, the UK published its plans to hold a referendum.  True, it did not expect the result to be anything other than 'remain' but even if it entertained the possibility of 'leave', the UK could not have used that as reasonable grounds for continuing to veto the MFF against the *possibility* that the UK might leave the EU before 2020.

Assent is not meaningful unless there is a realistic option to say 'no'.  In this case, the UK had no such option.

The 2018 budget is not a problem because the UK will remain a member for the full year.  What shall the UK do for 2019, then, knowing that its contributions will stop a quarter of the way through the year?  In any case, the UK will not have a vote on the 2020 budget because it will not by then be a member.

It's also important to note that the UK is being asked to fund the MFF up until 2020 without enjoying the benefits of EU membership beyond March 2019.  The EU is essentially breaking the *quid pro quo* upon which every agreement is based — that there is an exchange of 'consideration'.

Unsurprisingly, the UK objects to paying for benefits to which it will be denied, and the UK has good grounds for dissatisfaction at the financial mismanagement represented by the EU's failure to revise the MFF in a timely manner and the Commission's irresponsible assumption that budget = guaranteed income.

&gt; That's the reason there is no itemized and costed invoice, that will be a simple matter of applying the negotiated methodology.

The reason the UK has no legal liability is not because there *are no* liabilities, but rather the liabilities that exist attach to the Commission, not the UK.  Therefore, the same principles apply: liabilities are not negotiable.  The EU therefore must know exactly what its liabilities are, therefore there is no reason it can't present those liabilities to the UK and ask, as part of the agreement, for the UK to pay its costed share with all cards face-up on the table.

The only reasons I can think of that it has not done this is either because the UK's share is less than the EU wants, or its share is so enormous the UK would baulk and simply decline to pay a non-legal liability that it **cannot afford to pay**.

&gt; The negotiation would consist of UK end EU going over each act and finding an agreement on it's inclusion or lack thereof

The position paper makes no provision for excluding any of those Acts.  In fact, it stipulates that the headlines in Annex 1 are ""to be included"".

Again, the EU refuses to distinguish between budgeted and materialised allocations.  It does not entertain the possibility of reassessing allocations according to changing circumstances.

&gt; and on the exact liabilities associated with it, but to this day UK has not produced a reply/ engaged in this discussion.

That's because it can't reply to a bill it has not seen, and it won't simply guess.  We have, indeed, replied in the form of a demand for an invoice, but the EU declines to produce one.

&gt; You haven't conceded anything

I listed some of the concessions the UK made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/731h26/brexit_lack_of_sufficient_progress_on_divorce/dnsucn7/).

&gt; if you first agree to it but then refuse to engage

But we have engaged, we're just not engaging as the EU would wish us to.  This is normal for negotiations.

&gt; and actually respect the sequencing you agreed to. It actually becomes a further break of trust.

As I said, we agreed to the sequencing *vi coactus*, ie under duress, because had we not the negotiations would have begun in deadlock.  Again, assent absent choice is not meaningful.  We have respected the sequencing so far as it has been possible but unless some agreement can be reached on the exit bill, either the EU will have to agree to vary the sequencing *it imposed* or the negotiations will have to be formally declared permanently deadlocked.

If the latter happens, the question of trade becomes moot: it will be WTO terms.  The question will then become whether the EU is willing to talk about technical matters such as aviation, or whether it will dig its heels in and require us to comply or face a chaotic exit.

If that happens, there can be no suggestion that the EU is anything other than a hostile, bad-faith interlocutor because there are no circumstances under which one can speak of 'trust' under coercion.

At that point, the UK will just walk away because it's clear that the EU cannot be reasoned with, therefore there is nothing to talk about.

As I said, trust is a two-way street and the EU has a duty to carry its share of the water.

&gt; Uk hasn't conceded anything and hasn't engaged properly in any of the 3 first phase issues, except maybe citizens right

Nonsense.  The UK always agreed to some form of residency reciprocity, but it cannot tolerate the jurisdiction of a court within the UK that is not subject to Parliament, however we did **concede** due consideration to ECJ rulings on that matter.  

We have committed to an open NI border and to do everything in our power to support the GFA.

Attempts at informal concessions over money were rebuffed.  That covers the 3 first phase issues.

&gt; any successive UK government could in theory change the rights of eu citizen changing UK law put in effect after the agreement

No, because the UK Parliament would be bound by the residency agreement, same as it's bound by the TEU.  Same applies to the EU in respect of UK citizens resident in the EU27.

&gt; If UK were to ensure enforcement of the reciprocated rights

Reciprocity would be subject to an international agreement and enforced by the terms of the VCLT unless otherwise stipulated.  That first requires that an agreement be struck which, on current evidence, it won't because the EU is unwilling to vary its sequencing.

As I have pointed out before, the EU is not going to get everything it wants (and vice versa) and will get nothing it wants unless it is willing to show flexibility.

That's not the UK breaking its agreement on sequencing, because we never agreed to reach an agreement according to that sequencing, only that we would put up with the EU's scheduling.  If the EU chooses to apply that sequencing agreement in such a way that it results in no deal at all, that's not the UK's fault.

&gt; single market is a different matter

Forget the SM, it's clear that won't happen.

&gt; It's not irrational they want a reassurance that UK is willing to do whatever it takes.

Kind of like it wants the UK to write a blank cheque?  That *is* unreasonable.  We will do all that is *reasonable* to protect the GFA and the NI border up to and including not building a hard border even if customs protocol would usually oblige one.  If the EU decides to build a hard border on the EI side, that's its choice and not the UK's fault.

&gt; That if UK exits custom union and single market it will be willing to move the border between uk mainland and Northern Ireland.

I doubt that is plausible because it means that UK law (and only UK law) applies within part of the CU, and it would likely generate dissent amongst NI Unionists.",True,0,1509549652,,1509550646,0,dp6xfn4,True,t3_79h18h,t1_dp6dimx,/r/brexit/comments/79h18h/european_commission_unveils_its_plans_for_2018/dp6xfn4/,1512017354,1,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,public,

&gt;Yeah there are just so many reasons why this year's LoL finals are going to be absolute shit.    

&gt;1) My favorite teams being eliminated. G2 eliminated in group stage. TSM eliminated. C9 eliminated. FNC eliminated. MSF eliminated just kidding they are nobody's favorite team. I don't need anyone on this subreddit to explain to me the nature of competition, and how teams can only either win and continue playing, or lose and drop out. I don't want to hear that shit. When is Riot going to nerf Korean teams? I think next year's Worlds should be patched so that only one or two Korean teams can enter the competition. Failing that, we need Riot to make another version of Worlds, called the Westerns where only teams from North America and Europe can play.

&gt;2) Boring playstyle. It's well known that the Koreans have the rare ability to make any playstyle boring. This is evidenced by the fact that they are playing the exact style that G2 and TSM are famous for (farm for late game team macro and teamfighting), yet it is still somehow boring. If they farm for 30 minutes it's boring. If Bang's Twitch farms, it's boring. If the play lane dominance it's boring.

&gt;3) Same picks every single game by the Koreans .They pick the same damn picks every round and win it's so disgusting. This year’s semis had the same picks like Janna, Galio, Cho'Gath and Sejuani every game. Why can’t it be like LCS Finals between two tax paying, Western teams where we had Sejuani, Tristana, Gragas and Cho'Gath every game instead? I think Korean teams need to vary their picks more, because they are playing for my enjoyment as an audience member and I can't enjoy LoL when they keep conforming to tradition and picking the same heroes every game. The games need to be more like S6 Worlds where there was the same strat and same heroes in every single game, or S5 Worlds where there was the same strat and same heroes in every single game, or even S3 Worlds where we had the same strat and same heroes every game. Picking a strategy again that worked before in a tournament for money makes no sense at all. Fucking Koreans have no originality.

&gt;4) Nationalism. There are rumors floating around that Chinese people are racists and love China. This is despicable. America is the only country and Europe is the only continent anyone should feel any pride for. This is evidenced by the fact that nobody cares when the crowd cheers USA USA USA but posts about Chinese nationalism makes the front page on this subreddit. Martin Luther King Jr. turned around in his grave today because RACISM FUCKIN WON. Also, in a rare turn of events, Communism won as well for the first time in history.

&gt;5) I don't feel any emotional connection to the players. How am I supposed to feel any emotional connection to these faceless Korean players? They all look the same, for Chrissakes. What happened to God-fearing, Liberty-loving Westerners like soaz who's twitter literally makes me cry with emotion?. Or mithy, who's xenophobia in-game rivals my own closeted mistrust for other ethnicities?  Or the stony-faced rekkles? Or bjerg, the honorary American? These Korean players are mechanical and emotionless, nevermind the fact that I've never bothered to learn anything about them.

&gt;6) A team that is not from the West won. This is by far the biggest reason why this year's Worlds sucks. First of all, it's well known that the West wins everything. it should have won this competition too. We win the Olympics. We win at Baseball. We win at Basketball. We win at soccer. We won in Vietnam and Iraq. We DESERVE to win this. It is our God given RIGHT to win. How dare the Asians take this win from us.

ballisticbanana999,,,"Very, very, solid post. I recently moved from a very expensive city (Dubai, UAE) to spend some time in a small Russian city. Your points are very true. Due to a sometimes fairly low income upbringing, I have pretty low standards but even so. Here are a few pointers I've learned:

*Consumer goods:* Groceries in my part of Russia are not far off what you'd pay in the West. And due to the import ban on foods from Europe, shops are mostly stocked with low quality Russian stuff. To buy vaguely decent cheese, for example, will cost more than the West for lower quality.

*Real estate:* I don't care that much where I live (as long as it's private and quiet) and this is where I win. I share an apartment with a friend here for just $230 a month rent in total, although it's pretty grotty by Western standards. That's what you get when you live in a small city.

*Entertainment:* Beer and most alcohol is fairly cheap, but decent places to eat really aren't. In a decent bar here you'd pay prices not too far off the West ($5 a beer, $2-4 for basic bar snacks, $6 for a burger).

*Electronics*: Can't say because I bought everything before I came.

*Misc*: I managed to get a pretty decent haircut for around $6, but even so, that's not that much less than what I would pay at home. 

To add to all of this, when you take local salaries into account (a decent salary would be barely $1000 a month), it simply doesn't add up.

PennyPriddy,,,"The veins of protestant churches I've attended (which seem like they fit with the majority of American protestant churches, at least in the north) seem to take anywhere between an hour and an hour and a half. Some outliers take 2, if you've got someone who gives a really long sermon.

That might get longer if you have Sunday School after or before (rather than during), since different churches do that different ways. Some don't have adult Sunday school, since they have Bible study during the week. Some have ""children's church"" during the main service which more closely mirrors adult church (all the kids are in one room singing and listening to stories) with aged down content (less sermons about ""adult content,"" sometimes includes puppets or felt boards), while others have Sunday School during service which is split more tightly by age and is more likely to have interactive content (question and answer, small group crafts and games, etc).

But in most churches I've seen, it's at most an all morning affair, not usually an all day.

If it was in a foreign language for an English speaker it might not have represented protestant churches as a whole (especially US protestant churches).

sunagainstgold,europe,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe,"No. This story is a complete modern fabrication. It is titillating, it is sexist, it brings Science and Reason to the supernatural, and it is a whole lot more comfortable than the reality it was invented to explain away.

The various pieces of the figure that would become ""the witch"" in the early modern era were falling into place by the beginning of the fifteenth century. Broomsticks enter the legend fairly early on, but not nearly as early as that article would have you believe.

The trial of Alice Kyteler and Petronilla of Mearth (who never gets mentioned despite being the one who was actually burned at the stake--guess which one was the aristocrat and which one was the servant) referenced in the article, in 1324, predates *maleficium* as a formal charge; Petronilla was burned as a heretic, not a witch. But it's considered a very important sign of the diabolization of 'black magic' because a lot of the pieces of the later witch trope are present.

But not the broomstick.

You'll notice the article's quotation uses some funky spelling: ladie, staffe, and so on. That's because this is not from the chronicle account written by Bishop Richard Ledrede, who was present for the actual events, translated from its Latin into modern English. It's from *Holinshed's Chronicles*, which is to say, 1577. The closest Ledrede comes is:

&gt; The bishop [i.e. the author] made a huge fire in the center of Kilkenny, and on it, for all to see, he burnt a sack full of potions, powders, oils, nails, hair, herbs, worms, and countless other horrible items which Alice had used in her sorcery and magic.

Whatever the ""truth"" behind Ledrede's account (his narrative has little to do with the actual heresy case and is much more concerned with discussing injustices against him and the matter of Church versus secular authority, so he needs to make himself look good), we see the trappings of what appear to be spells and potions *if* one is already inclined to see their owner as a witch.

This is important when looking at the full passage from Holinshed and other later accounts with almost the same wording (but not Ledrede's). They recount among the charges against Kyteler:

&gt; Also that she swept the streets of Kilkennie between Compline and twilight, raking all the filth towards the doores of hir sonne William, murmuring secretlie with hir self these words: *To the house of William my sonne / Hie all the wealth of Kilkennie towne.*

First, Holinshed is sort of right about some of the other charges (Kyteler's alleged sexual liason with a demon/incubus called the Son of Art or Robin, Son of Art, becomes a ""nightly conference with a spirit called Robert Artisson, to whom she sacrificed on the highway nine red cocks and nine peacocks' eyes."") However, the broom/sweeping bit is a post-14th century addition to the tale. This is important became it makes the broom another one of those ""tools of the witch's trade.""

That is to say, the broom in the witch legend by the late 16th century was an everyday object assimilated into people's idea of the ""witch's toolbox"". The interesting thing is, it wasn't the only one initially. Early witch iconography from Germany has witches with cooking forks as their symbol--cooking and consumption (including cannibalism) were major components of the witch legend, too. However, the imagery of broomsticks became more popular in France first. From a group of 1420s-40s witch hunts, royal magistrate Claude Tholosan pieced together the following information out of confessions. (Broedel observes that this was a different version of cannibalism than Tholosan had originally found in stories of non-witch heretical movements).

*His* witches would go out one night a week, identify an unlucky local child, and slaughter them. The witches would cook the victim, literally. The fat from the child would be the ointment smeared on the broomstick to enable them to fly to their feasts with the devil. It's a specific, gory, and well-attested in global cannibalism folklore idea of the ""witches' brew"" used in a spell--here, to animate the broomstick.

But /u/sunagainstgold, you say, there's a problem. You're citing official investigative reports and the actual confessions of women accused as witches as though they were factual.

And therein lies exactly the problem: *women and men in early modern Europe confessed to witchcraft.*

And not just confessed. Confessed in all the gruesome, sacrilegious, titillating, diabolic detail their inquisitors could record. The pattern happens frequently enough across national/cultural/linguistic boundaries (with details varying regionally), and is found in diverse enough types of sources, that scholars are very comfortable saying: yes, women and men accused of witchcraft confessed, and named their accomplices, even knowing there was a high risk they were sentencing themselves and their friends to a horrible death. They told stories of naked nighttime flights to have sex with Satan, of wild parties with the other witches of the town in the woods, of the deceptions they laid on other people, the things they made other people believe they saw. They said these things under oath and despite the potential, or certain, death to follow. They said these things despite them not being in the least bit true.

This should be deeply unsettling to us.

That's where the hallucinogenic dildos come in.

There's this idea perennially circulating in various pop medieval/early modern bad history about ergot poisoning. Ergot is a fungus that can grow on various grains and cause a whole bunch of bad symptoms before it kills the person who inadvertently eats it. Ergot poisoning has been used to explain medieval prophetic visions, the Anabaptist kingdom in Munster, most famously the testimony of the *accusers* at Salem--and here it is pressed into service to explain why 50,000 women and men across Europe died at the stake, in the river, or on the gallows as witches.

We crave a ""biological"" explanation for the confessions. The witches, it is comforting to believe, *believed* what they were confessing was true, and believed it because of Science. In the modern world, we can prevent this by preventing rye poison. We're smarter, we're better, it can't happen again.

Ergot poisoning, as numerous scholars have shown, bears very little resemblance to the actual situations noted above...unless those 50,000 people also developed seizures, gangrene, diarrhea, vomiting, skin peeling off, and other fun things *without this being noted in records.* Some people occasionally fall into hallucinations or psychosis. But, you know, Science.

And you'll notice one more important part about this myth: it implicates the *victims,* and does so in a way that criminalizes female sexuality. Medieval women trying to get themselves off did a thing that made them believe they were witches. And this practice is why, when faced with physical and psychological torture, they told stories of flying through the night to consort with Satan. Because in this worldview women are just that lustful, and that can only ever be a bad thing.

The intentional stimulation of visions of the divine played a major role in later medieval culture. It was in fact associated with women in particular. This association grew stronger over the 14th century as male theologians grew ever more anxious about the power of women's visions and the potential that women, the weaker sex, could so so easily be corrupted (""seduced"") like Eve. It was an interpretation forced onto and yet accepted by women visionaries,  a bargain for the potential authority their visions might grant them in a deeply patriarchal world. By the 15th, it was an open question whether a woman's visions of God and Christ, once only needing her word to confirm their veracity, came from ""nature"" (hallucinations), God--or the devil.

But when these women (and much more rarely in this case, men) had visions of the devil, they recounted themselves *oppressed* and *tempted* by the demons, they told of their *victories over* Satan. And they didn't need hallucinogens smeared on *instrumenta vel machinae* to produce these visions.

Silhouette,,,"I understand the arguments, at least at a basic level, over what is and isn't included in any calculations.

My point here is just that if you're going to criticise the Leave campaign for talking about £350M that isn't realistically what we ever actually send to the EU, it's also fair to point out that what we're currently paying isn't even close to covering the long-term liabilities that are (per the EU's interpretation) racking up to the tune of tens of billions more.

Edit to add: Ultimately only two general scenarios seem to be possible here.

One possibility is that the EU is spending considerably beyond its means, in the sense that what member states including the UK are contributing doesn't cover the expenditure. Essentially, the EU is quietly racking up the continental credit card bill and hoping nobody will notice, and that's why it now argues the UK owes such a high amount. In this scenario, even the £350M figure could be a considerable understatement of how much of the UK's money the EU is actually budgeting to spend, if a lot of the debt is effectively being kept off the books that the public are looking at.

The other possibility is that the EU is spending within its means, and the ongoing contributions by member states do cover the ongoing expenditure. In this scenario, it makes no sense that the UK could leave the EU near the end of a budget cycle and wind up still owing many times its usual annual contribution as a member state even though it will by default lose all the privileges of that membership upon leaving.

Economically speaking both situations are plausible and obviously there are countless details to consider, but either way someone is playing funny money accounting games involving billions of Euros.",True,0,1509551612,,1509552808,0,dp6zcdk,False,t3_7a1xdn,t1_dp6pyek,/r/ukpolitics/comments/7a1xdn/uk_contributions_to_eu_half_the_amount_claimed_by/dp6zcdk/,1512018429,2,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

I lean independent/libertarian/conservative and support Trump’s MAGA agenda. Our state college is pretty much white and I hung out with the college republicans, greek life, and foreign/international exchange students (mainly Korean, Chinese, and European students). My time at college, the Asian crowd I enjoyed hanging the most were the engineers and international students. The pre-med, pre-pharm, be a doctor-cause-parents-said-so Asian American crowd were the most toxic to Asian identity imo. They were the most white worshipping, status worshipping, superficial crowd who will use you to get an A in their pre-med classes. I avoided them after experiencing them first hand lol. The Asian engineering students were non-back stabbing and hilarious to hang out with.

""A country""? Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. I know a country named North Korea, and an American puppet colony to the south. Maybe you're referring to that one?

&gt;This fucking anti imperialism rhetoric the Chinese go for fucking baffles me when China was an Empire long before and for much longer than any European country was.

China at it's largest was [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/18_century_Qing_China.png/250px-18_century_Qing_China.png). As you can see, there's no empire, only China (and Mongolia, but they conquered us, so what gives?).

Again, you're projecting. Your masters/owners in the west are the imperialists, not us. You're probably salty that we'll save you from them, whether you want that or not. Call it tough love, if you will.

&gt;Just because you've been taking a beating from every fucking European country and Japan (who you really, really underestimated) for 200 years

Shit happens. They took Tibet and Hong Kong: we took them back. They armed Taiwan: We'll take them back. Notice how these are all Chinese territories, there's no imperialism at sight.

We *might* take you back as well, but rest assured: Only to give you back to your true owners: The Kims. *Then* you'll have a country named Korea. Wonderful, isn't it?

Our power grows every second and your daddy the US grows less capable of defending you and it's other puppet (yep, Japan is no country either).

Tirax,001,E.U.,"&gt; They're neither yes nor no and thus shouldn't be counted as hypothetical proponants of either side.

Exactly. For me legal matters of such constitutional magnitude have to be founded on an electoral support that shows clear guidance. Deliberation rather than complacent apathy misinterpreted as permission. 

&gt; Why are you so afraid of people democratically deciding they want to live in a different state then they do now? 

Because for Catalonians, unlike say the Kurds, no history of systematic abuse or violation of inalienable human rights is at the order. I can understand regions wanting more autonomy over fiscal and cultural matters. Taxation and language policy for instance. Here, the central government of Spain has for too long denied further federalization and devolution of competences to its regions, Catalonia as well as say Galicia or the Basque region. But for this problem calling for independence is less of a solution and more of a problem of different sorts. 

First, it would mean that in democratic nations such as Spain the people are not able to self determinate their way to a reformed but inclusive state where people of different cultures can coexist and feel confident with the multiple layers of their identity. A implicit admit of defeat for what it means to be democratic. Nationalism, the sense of identity coming forth of the location where you happened to be born is the most arbitrary, and therefor, in my opinion, the most unfounded. The police brutality was regrettable and makes it hard to defend the Spanish government. But I solemnly belief in a solution *within* the Spanish state rather than *outside* of it.

Second, in line with the first, for my vision of borders isn't as much that they are ""unchangeable"". Rather, for me its that they are/were destined to evolve to becoming ""unnecessary"". Catalonian separation would mean additional borders being drawn. The recent historical evolution on the European continent have been in the opposite direction. This evolution I wish to maintain.

&gt;Besides, constitions have been changed before with 2/3 parliamentary majorities which did not have 2/3 support of the people (or even 2/3 of the cast votes due to less proportionate voting systems)

Something which I also would support to see amended. This is why you will here me support proportional voting systems preferably without a threshold (as in the Netherlands) and numerous voting barrier reducing measures such as the ability to post ballots in advance (as in the US).

&gt;And we have a precedent with the Scottish independence referendum, a legal poll organised by the British state for which a simple majority was enough.

British constitutional law is a whole other beast precisely because of the absence of a codified constitution. The UK government was of the opinion that the referendum only needed a simple majority. An opinion which I do not share.

&gt;And what about a referendum with a 72.8% turnout and a 92.7% vote in favour of independence? That would mean that slightly more than 2/3 of all eligible voters voted for independence. Would you recognside that?

I would. Precisely because Kurds already have a history of literally extermination on orders of Baghdad. And even then I still see a possibility of mending those historical wrongs *within* a more federal Iraqi state (but not with the current government obviously). International community reacts the way we can expect the international community to react. Politically, it is not surprising that the international community would side with Madrid/Baghdad; such is the reality of international politics. I said their reaction is understandable, but that in itself provides little, if any, bearing. 

&gt;For me it's clear. Every region that can manage to get more than 50% support in a democratic vote that gives everyone the chance to vote without any manipulation of pressure on either side, gets my support for their indolence.

I disagree. 

&gt;That's what the Catalans wanted as well, before they were denied this and the regionalism radicalised into separatism.

Exactly. Which I find wholly regrettable. ",True,0,1509553305,,1509553678,0,dp71181,False,t3_79ngqd,t1_dp6nmcr,/r/belgium/comments/79ngqd/puigdemont_is_in_brussel/dp71181/,1512019346,1,False,belgium,t5_2qhe6,public,

Seems to be a real luck of the draw - though maybe it's also generational too, i.e first Generation Metis are more likely demonstrate these genetic traits than second, etc.

October 29, 2017 19.41 Europe/London By Robert Briel

LG U+ and Huawei have successfully completed the pre-commercial trial of the world’s first live ultra-high-definition (UHD) IPTV over 5G FWA with a chipset based 5G millimeter-wave CPE.

...

The 5G CPE developed by Huawei debuted in this demonstration. This 5G CPE is the world’s first chipset based on CPE with a true commercial engineering capability, including ODU (outdoor equipment unit) and IDU (indoor equipment unit). In the capacity test, Huawei’s 5G CPE demonstrated more than a 2Gbps peak capacity, larger than the current rate of FTTx, highlighting 5G FWA practical value and application potential.

MrFuzzyPenguin,irelia,StayCalmAndWin,"&gt; I really dont see why people complain about SKT winning.

My response is merely an answer to this sentence. 

I never implied I have a solution. I'm also not disappointed with anyone, I believe it's all fair rules and that western teams try their best to compete with koreans and even when they fail everytime, that's ok. Many sports are dominated by one or two regions/countries.

That being said, I can't lie that I wouldn't be happier to see Europe in the finals. Or NA. Or anyone else , but koreans for that matter. 

Solution? Best we can hope is for other regions to step it up and be able to compete with Korea. Misfits and RNG came pretty darn close to winning vs SKT this year and it was amazing.

Catalonia has the right to have pro-independence parties, funded with tax-payer money, to carry out their activities within the boundaries of the rule of law and the constitution.

To call Catalonia oppressed displays a level of willful ignorance that should not be tolerated from someone that strives to make information free.

sammmuel,,,"C'est pareil partout, c'est ça mon point. Ben oui et le monde technique comprend pas le côté politique ou encore comptable. Alors que les autres departments comprennent que c'est différent et que tout le monde a son expertise, le monde technique pense que tout le monde est con de pas se prosterner devant leur expertise technique face aux challenges d'une nature autre (politique, RH, ventes etc.)

Les ingénieurs et les TI pensent qu'ils sont spéciaux. Non, ils ne le sont pas. Je travail maintenant en marketing et les challenges face aux attentes des clients sont a peu près les mêmes. Le client veut plus pour moins sans comprendre les limitations. Mais au final c'est pas au client a changer sa réalité. Dans le cas de Phenix, il y a une réalité politique et syndicale avec laquelle l'entreprise, incluant ses techniciens, n'ont pas su composer avec la réalité du client.

Comme j'ai dit, les gens techniques sont toujours très presse de se débarrasser des humains alors que c'est une des énormes raisons pourquoi le projet est catastrophique du plan de vue humain, justement. On a tenté trop rapidement de se debarasser des pousseux de crayon avec les conseils techniques fournit alors que n'importe quel analyste des politiques internes auraient pu dire: non, ça pas de sens autrement que sur le plan technique.

Je ne pense pas que les gens techniques sont plus a blâmer mais plutôt qu'ils sont autant a blâmer que les autres. La réalité politique d'un contrat gouvernemental fait en sorte que les gens du côté politique (les analystes politiques du gouvernement) et le staff technique d'IBM aurait du se parler. Mais comme d'habitude dans ses projets-la, y'a eu du travail en silo, on a voulu mettre les expertises des uns par dessus les autres (que ce soit comptable, technique ou autre) et la on blâme les autres departements. Et tout le monde se plaint que ça marche pas parce que tout le monde est convaincu que c'est parce que leur département a pas été a l'avant-plan alors que le problème c'est que tout le monde a voulu être a l'avant-plan, pensant que le mandat de leur département est plus important que lui des autres. 

Évidemment, mon expérience est que le staff technique est celui qui regarde les autres de haut mais tout le monde est coupable. C'est assez évident quand tu check la manières dont le staff technique traite les ventes. Eh bien merde, si les vendeurs vendaient juste ce que le staff technique voulait, la moitié des clients existeraient pas. Alors un moment donné faut que les choses se fasse pour rester dans la game. 90% du temps les choses vont quand même marcher et le client va être content; ça va juste avoir pousser dans le derrière de ceux qui font le produit ou rendent le service. C'est chiant mais bon, tout le monde au privé se fait pousser dans le cul anyway. Mais ça c'est un autre problème.

hahayeahhaha,,,"The UK will leave the EU by automatic operation of law on 29 March 2019 (or another date if agreed by the UK and the EU).

This is about as definite a thing as can be said about Brexit, perhaps the only outcome that one can say is more likely than not.

Yet this departure is still not certain, at least not absolutely. The Article 50 notification could perhaps be revoked. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has mentioned this more than once.

A revocation is, in theory, possible. It would need to be done in good faith, rather than to circumvent the two-year time limit and restart the clock. But if it was done sincerely then it would probably be accepted by the European Council. On the other hand, a revocation done just as a cynical negotiation tactic would not be either legally or politically acceptable to the European Council nor, if litigated, to the European Court of Justice.

But even taking the possibility into account, the fact remains that the UK’s departure from the EU is perhaps the only event in Brexit that one can be confident is likely to happen. Of nothing other than this can we be half as confident. Everywhere else there is delay, disparity, division and darkness.

Delays

There is a delay to the EU27 assessing whether there is “sufficient progress” in the negotiations; delay to the UK cabinet discussing the shape of any future trade relationship with the EU; delay in the UK government bringing forward the domestic Brexit legislation; delay in the UK opening even preliminary discussions on post-Brexit trade deals; and delay in announcing the date for the next round of UK and EU talks.

Almost everything that can be delayed is being delayed. Yet the Article 50 countdown continues.

But one thing is not being delayed. The EU27 have started their own internal preparations for the trade deal. Desperate Leave supporters have hailed this as a positive sign. But given that the reason the EU has such an advantage over the UK in the current exit negotiations is because the EU was preparing when the UK was dilly-dallying, this is an indication of the hard deal-making to come. The EU is getting ready and the UK, again, is not.

Disparities and divisions

With the delays there are disparities and divisions, again to the disadvantage of the UK. The disparities are those between the UK and EU in the negotiations. Of course, differences of view and of interest are to be expected. But these are more fundamental: not the amount of the financial settlements but the very methodology, and not the scope of enforceable rights for UK and EU citizens but the very principle of enforcement. And with the Irish border there is a problem without any conceivable solution.

The divisions are within the UK. The London government is not at one with those in Edinburgh and Cardiff. There appears to be no majority in either House of Parliament for any model of Brexit. The members of the UK cabinet disagree as to basic points (in telling contrast to the unanimity of the remaining EU states). The electorate, which only supported Brexit 52:48, was never united.

Darkness

And with the delays, disparities and divisions, there is darkness. The UK’s department responsible for exiting the EU has 58 reports detailing the impact of Brexit on various areas of national life. The subjects of these reports is known but the contents are not.

The reports should be in the public domain. Any responsible government would want to warn people of what was about to happen, so arrangements and decisions can be made.

But for no good reason, the UK government is refusing to publish them. The excuse is that disclosure would adversely affect the UK negotiating position. Of course, the reports would not make any difference to the country’s position, even if they would make a real difference to the lives of British citizens and companies. In any case, the EU is aware of British weaknesses: it has been negotiating trade deals on our behalf for 40 years.

Dishonesty, or desperation

Some would say there is a further “D” word: dishonesty. This is, however, a law and policy blog, not a political one, so alleging dishonesty against individual politicians is far outside its remit. But there are propositions being made by ministers and pundits that are not accurate, and those putting forward those propositions know (or should know) they are inaccurate.

Perhaps they are desperate rather than dishonest, but their motive is irrelevant.

The ultimate cause of the Brexit troubles

So the troubles of Brexit can be listed: delays, disparities, divisions, darkness, dishonesty and desperation. But these are symptoms and manifestations of a deeper problem.

This cause of all the trouble is not the Brexit vote itself. (As this blog has previously explained, there is a way of exiting the EU that would avoid many of the current problems. It would have to be by treaty, not via Article 50, and would take at least 10 years and be done incrementally.) Brexit could be done far more sensibly and sustainably, if the government was realistic.

The ultimate problem of Brexit is delusion. The delusion is that something complex can be treated as if it were simple. The reason Brexit is becoming increasingly problematic is that the UK government still has no real grasp of what needs to be done. And from this misdirection, everything else follows.

Leave campaigners pretended departure and trade deals were easy. Red lines were declared to win cheers and claps at a party conference without recognition of how those lines would tangle and bind. The UK blithely sent the Article 50 notification, as a signal of political virility, without thinking things through. Politicians believed appeasing the domestic media was enough to gain advantage in negotiations.

Easy answers

This reckless Brexit superficiality is akin to the simplistic “regime change” notions that led to the deadly mess that followed the Iraq invasion.

The lack of proper planning and any attention to detail will mean the problems and issues will multiply. It is probably too late to change course on Brexit: all we can do is brace ourselves, and wait for the smashes against the wall of reality.

Some readers of this blog will know the late Marxist historian Eric Hobsawm‘s sequence of general histories with the titles The Age of Revolution, The Age of Capital, The Age of Empire and, taking the story to 1991, The Age of Extremes.

A sequel bringing the story up to date, covering regime change and Brexit as well as the supposed “end of boom and bust” and the rise of Donald Trump, could well be called The Age of Easy Answers. Our political elites told us complex things were easy, and enough voters and pundits fell for it.

Graymouzer,,,"We should do everything we can to end these practices. That said, someone in Mr. Kelly's position should be careful with his words. His reading of the Civil War would probably have been in line with what he was taught in high school and college and there is some truth to it. General Lee was an honorable man in the context of his time and place. The history of the United States was a story about compromises on the question of slavery right up to the Civil War. The problem is that slavery was at odds with ideals of our founding documents and our idea of what we want the United States to be. At the same time, the institution of slavery became more important to the economy of the South. Much of the wealth of the Southern elite was tied up in slaves and much of the remainder was in land that was only profitable to work with slave labor. Many of these people were in debt and their collatoral was often slaves. Competition from colonized parts of the world with exploited labor supressed the value of commodities like cotton. So, for the South, emacipation posed the problem of giving up most of it's wealth, giving up the means of producing wealth from it's land, and the question of what to do with all the emancipated slaves. Social Darwinism was a trending meme at the time and many if not most white people saw blacks as a seperate and inferior race. They could not imagine living on equal terms with them. That sentiment was not confined to the South either. So, Southerners doubled down on slavery. If they thought it was a necessary evil in the Founder's days they came to see it was a desirable good by the mid 19th century and looked back to classical times and the Bible for justification. They engaged in whataboutism, criticizing the wage slavery of the industrial North and the imperialism of Europe as worse than slavery. They were pretty good at pointing out the speck in their brother's eyes too and these critiques are a good read. However, no matter how bad wage slavery and imperialism were, that does not mean that slavery was not evil. I think treating people as things coarsens the soul. It's our original sin and there's no justifying it. The corrosive effects on our regional and national character have metastacized into mass incarceration, police brutality, racism, and a general sense of division in our society. I don't know how or when we will actually overcome all of this but we have to start by recognizing that things didn't suddenly become fair in 1865 or in 1968 with the passing of the Civil Rights Act. There has been resisitance to treating African Americans as equals all the way down to the present day. I do think things are getting better but my optimism has been diminished here lately.

MrBoonio,zzjesus,Jesus Christ,"Paywall:

What would have happened had unidentified individuals in Iran, France or Venezuela attacked Jewish shopkeepers and forced them to close their shops? What apologies and expressions of shock our diplomats would have demanded from the European Union, the United Nations and who knows who else. And with what glee various researchers would have drawn a graph of global hatred and been interviewed at length, with grave expressions, about the worrisome anti-Semitic characteristics – so reminiscent of a dark past – of robbing Jews of their livelihood and destroying their property.

But for we Israelis, this rhetorical question has lost its power to educate, embarrass and shame. The fact that so many Israelis are involved in robbing so many Palestinians of their livelihood doesn’t even register on our seismographs. Those seismographs are calibrated only to record, say, agricultural thefts that were seemingly carried out by Palestinians. In contrast, all the actions we routinely carry out so that Palestinians will lose their sources of income elicit one big yawn. Listen, you can already hear it.

This rhetorical question isn’t aimed at Israelis, because they are the potential beneficiaries of the robbery, if not the ones already benefiting from it. Here’s a small, partial, recent example: According to complementary reports by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and two nongovernmental organizations, Rabbis for Human Rights and Yesh Din, over the past few weeks, unidentified individuals have stolen olives from more than 1,000 trees in 11 Palestinian villages in the West Bank – Azmut, Awarta, Yanun, Burin, Qaryut, Far’ata, Jit, Sinjil, Al-Magheir, Al-Jinya, Al-Khader. Moreover, unidentified individuals, who looked like Jews, assaulted harvesters from the villages of Deir al-Khattab, Burin, As-Sawiya and Kafr Kalil and drove them from their orchards.

Aside from in Burin, where the army located some of the Jewish thieves and returned the harvest to its owners, these thefts meant that an investment of time, money and effort had gone down the drain. In most of the villages, the looting occurred in areas that outposts and settlements have ring-fenced with intimidation and violence, and where the army, in response, has penalized the Palestinians by limiting their access to their lands.

This is how we ensure that in another few years, there will be vacant land on which to build another luxury neighborhood. The indifferent Israelis know that soon they’ll be able to buy a dirt-cheap villa with a fantastic view there. Hence they yawn.

There is theft ostensibly perpetrated by individuals, and then there’s state theft – in the village of Al-Walaja, for example. It’s very possible that this is the last year in which the olive harvest will take place there as it should. Next year, residents will already be subject to a permit regime in order to reach their lands via an agricultural gate in the separation wall, which will be opened only when the agricultural staff officer at Israel’s Civil Administration in the West Bank decides it should be opened – for two or three months a year. In the morning it will open and close immediately, and in the evening it will be open and close immediately.

Last Friday, a resident of Al-Walaja and Israeli volunteers from Engaged Dharma, who were helping to harvest his land, preferred to talk about things that are pleasant to talk about: the quality of the olive oil, the plump olives growing on the trees near the pool, the more wizened olives that had been harvested from the lower terrace, the glorious taste of the radishes and green onions that he grows between the trees. But next year, residents of the village will contend with strict conditions for getting a permit – conditions that contradict the Palestinians’ custom of working the land collectively, and which very likely won’t allow them to continue growing vegetables there.

The yawners are already hiking on Al-Walaja’s lands, which have been declared a national park for rest and relaxation, for carousels and ritual immersion by Jews. And God willing, next year, when the wall’s construction has been completed, no Palestinians – the land’s legal owners – will be seen there.

The rhetoric here makes clear why, say, a European and South American boycott of, say, Israeli agricultural produce is necessary and justified.

I'm guessing you didn't pay any attention to blizzards plans for the owl and have heard of it for the first time through this thread?

Blizzard has a very good reasoning for the city based teams, and they have explained said reasoning plenty of times, starting on last years blizzcon during the very announcment.

&gt;There's no need for this many US teams to begin with. If they want this to be a global thing (which they do), there needs to be more than a whole three non-US teams. 

While that's true, it's out of blizzs influence. The investors decided what city they wanted to purchase the spot in.

Blizzard most likely offered more EU spots, but if none of the buyers is interested in them...well nothing to do about that.

As someone who studied geography and urban design, that's just straight up not true. Yes, maybe in areas like Oklahoma or something with huge swaths of straight and level land that's possible, but where I am on the east coast, you can trace many of our main roads back to their colonial origins, which were carriage paths, and it is why all of our roads are so windy and all over the place now a days.

kearsarge,,Geography Enthusiast,"First off, look at the date on the second image. This is 1000 AD, not at the same time as the first image. The Holy Roman Empire was not a tribe, nor was the already formed Kingdom of Norway and Denmark, or the Kingdom of Sweden, or the Kingdom of England. We are talking about states that had complex governments and architecture, where large monumental Romanesque churches and castles would exist, and were not some barbarians on the edge of civilization. Second, as someone with an interest in Islamic and Byzantine History, I know all to well that the pan Mediterranean world was close culturally, this would be even more true without the Germanic invasions, or the rise of Islam under the Ummayad and Rashidun Caliphates, and that it did not share much with East Asian cultures.


 That being said, I find your fascist apologia to be bizarre. The Nazis were white supremacists. Most were not neo-pagan, a few were, but the idea that they all were is blatantly false, Hitler was a christian, as was Goering, and the idea that the enitre Nazi leadership worshipped Odin and Thor was a common myth. Though they believed that southern and Eastern Europeans were inferior, they also believed that Africans were even more so, with Jews at the bottom. Seeing as they thought of themselves as more or less the only pure white race, they could be considered white supremacists. Not going to comment on Mussolini's relations with islam because I have no idea about it, I have never looked into this topic, but considering that Mussolini wanted to make a new Roman Empire in his rhetoric, I sincerely doubt that he would be highly interested in doing anything other than annexing former british Muslim dominated colonies into his ""Empire,"" especially considering his invasion of Ethiopia just a few years before WWII.

to be honest, I do kind of agree with you on the idea of Europe, especially considering its fuzzy borders. Armenia, Cyprus and Georgia are not in Europe (though technically, as the Caucasus Mountains form the border of Europe and Asia, Georgia's northern border is theoretically infinitesimally within Europe) yet they are often considered European because of cultural reasons. Due to this fuzziness, I prefer a Eurasian continent. Historically, I will admit that Europe is a continent, especially due to the colonization period, where most of the worlds independent states were in Europe, or former European colonies, while more or less everything else was either a colony, or a protectorate. (with some exceptions, such as China or Ethiopia, or Japan, or the Ottoman Empire) As Europe was different from the rest of the world historically, it could be considered a continent of its own.",True,0,1509560176,,False,0,dp780hh,False,t3_79zbv8,t1_dp72o16,/r/geography/comments/79zbv8/when_europe_was_invented_as_continent/dp780hh/,1512023070,2,False,geography,t5_2qnms,public,

Yes, it's very bad. It's not just 'slapping', which by itself would be bad enough already. You're repeatedly traumatizing (yes, that's the correct term) with a fine needle on a sensitive skin. On an animal that couldn't give consent to have their bodily autonomy violated with such a level.

""Cutting its balls off"", as you crudely put it (clearly indicating a lack of knowledge on the actual procedure) is for the benefit of the ANIMAL.

It literally does make them different and they are different on so many accounts it's hard to even begin. The one argument presented is by itself already enough.

So? Not a justification for doing the same thing with anesthesia. Most people murdered didn't get anesthesia either. It doesn't become any less of murder if they did. Extreme example but very valid analogy that illustrates a clear flaw in your reasoning.

Genetic traits are real. That doesn't mean that there is one, single, Italian genetic trait. As you said, most people have such diverse ancestries that there is no clear primary ethnic trait.

&gt;It sounds super nice on paper but does more harm than good economically.

This is actually difficult to back up fully, in part because Socialism has never been fully realized. Many ""very socialist"" countries (namely the rich European countries) seem to get along just fine economically, and most first-world countries seem to be able to add more and more socialist policies without being ruined economically. When people ask me for an example of where socialist policies have worked, I say ""The United States"".

Socialism doesn't require ""everybody to be on the same ground"": just that the means of production are owned collectively. There could still be differences in earnings based on ability, talent, market forces, or merit. 

&gt;This system even hurts the lower class too considering someone who works a full time job will have to give his money to someone who works only part time.

I've never heard of any socialist system requiring this. In fact, many socialist systems explicitly tie income to labor, effort, or sacrifice. ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.""

Elvysaur,,,"&gt;People who lived in crete during minoan times and now have the same genetic makeup. So if cretans are seen as white today they would be seen as white then. 

Minoan civilization preceded the Aryan invasion of Europe, so no they were not genetically identical at all (though obviously genetically similar, since there's some level of population continuity, especially with the women).  

If we go by Minoan art as a representation of their appearance (which the dreadlock people seem to want to do), then the Minoans ranged from white to black in skin color, and all of them had black hair and eyes.  Dark brown skin is extremely common in paintings, so not exactly a white ethnic group.  

The gene analyses show us that both these people and the earliest steppe ""Indo-Europeans"" had a complete lack of light eye and hair colors, and the most major skin mutations were at frequencies found in modern day Arabs/north Indians/north Africans.  

So neither of these populations was white, and the original Minoan population wasn't genetically European.  What is true is that modern European people are anywhere from 20 - 85% non-European.

&gt; Lukas Graham is a Danish pop band consisting of vocalist Lukas Graham Forchhammer (born September 18, 1988), drummer Mark ""Lovestick"" Falgren (born November 28, 1988), bassist Magnus Larsson (born September 9, 1990) and keyboardist Kasper Daugaard (born June 14, 1989). 

&gt; Launching their debut album in 2012 on Copenhagen Records, Lukas Graham quickly became a popular live act in Denmark. That success translated to the rest of Europe and caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records who co-signed them in 2013. The band’s music was first introduced worldwide with the release of their two singles ""Mama Said"" and ""7 Years"", the latter of which topped various international charts. Their second album was released internationally on April 1. Read more on Last.fm.

It certainly doesn't exist on the Europeanist side, although it's possible that someone on the Japanese side of the disciplinary aisle has written something that I don't know about.

The closest anyone has come is Marc Bloch's short comparative chapter at the end of his magisterial *Feudal Society*. However, that's from the 1930s, and while Bloch was and remains incredibly influential, we've come very far in our understanding of medieval society in the past 80 years. The reason noone has attempted it since is pretty simple: a) people have enough trouble defining and agreeing on 'feudalism'/knights/honour-service culture in just one continent, do trying to do two is especially daunting and b) the sheer amount of work needed to produce a proper study is beyond the capability of one modern specialized scholar - even just in language skills, you're looking at a minimum of modern English, French, German, Japanese (and possibly Italian and Spanish), plus medieval Latin, Old French, medieval Japanese and classical Chinese. 

I do believe that such a study would be fascinating and fruitful, however, and the good news is that it's more likely to happen now than at any point since Bloch.

Sigur. Diriga, pentru ca, ""chemare"", ""simtul datoriei"", sau... ce? Cei 2000RON pe care-i primeste pe luna? De ce nu-s elevii si parintii in fata la minister, ca e viitorul lor in joc, nu viitorul dirigintei?

&gt; Sau poate ca unii oameni vor ca banii care se duc la coruptie sa se duca la chestiile necesare (materiale didactice, minima renovare/intretinere a scolii, etc) si sa nu mai dea ei din buzunar pentru ca fura altii bugetul.

Sigur ca vor. Toti vrem asta. Crezi ca daca nu dau bani, o sa il mustre constinta pe Liviu Pop, si o sa zica ""tre' sa opresc coruptia asta, nu se mai poate, saracii copii, le distrug viitorul""? 

Cati dintre cei care nu dau bani se rezuma la acest unic ""gest civic"" - si cati il completeaza cu pichetarea ministerului, activism politic... stii tu, ORICE, dar ceva care sa ajute la concret? Din ce am observat eu, daca-i exclud pe cei care nu dau ca nu-si permit (de inteles), aia care ""nu dau din convingere"" sunt de cele mai multe ori niste ""freeriders"" egoisti care nici nu fac altceva decat sa se planga.

thekarmikbob,dm,DM,"First /u/MasterBaser is spot-on *You have to make sacrifices in realism when using the grid* - frankly that idea applies to the entire game. Any game rule system is an abstraction of real-world physics. If you want real-world physics in a combat system check out The Morrow Project.

Second, this is one of the reasons the diagonal 5 foot/10 foot rule is helpful.

Third, the rule on cones (Specific example PH 204) is that a cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. In other words, a 15 foot cone extends 15 feet from point of origin, whether center or edge of the origination square - and determining that is usually up to the caster and/or the DM.

Fourth, Sage Advice is not authoritative. Only the Sage Compendium and the errata's are authoritative. That's why it has a banner and link saying ""Official Rules Answers"" which takes you to Sage Compendium. Anything up on sageadvice.eu is guidance only.

Last, if you want to strive for maximum configurability by the caster, yet semi-realistic cone area of inclusion, use a template - they are absolute. The only variations will be the starting point, and the angle.

&gt; Saying ""they didn't care"" is bullshit as you have no evidence to support that. You're not them. I could say NA didn't care and still beat EU, proving their superiority

Drafts are facts. NA teams knew EU players pocketpicks and had prepared strategy for them. Best example was TSM stomping FNC after giving them Kennen + Shen, it was 100% obvious from the beginning it was a bait, but FNC had no other way but to take it, because they had 0 preparation and strategy, other than ""let's play our usual shit against teams we don't know and see how it goes lul"". 

It's not a coincidence that EU drafts completely sucked dick at RR and they got stomped, yet couple months later they do what they always do at Worlds. It's 100% obvious, it's fucking common sense - they didn't prepare for RR.

I never said anything about domination, but if they prepared, I would expect usual pretty equal run from both sides, maybe EU winning slightly, maybe NA winning slightly. But that stomp was an outlier, and it didn't came from nothing. Whole year, MSI, Worlds, it's business as usual.

The whole concept of ""indigineous peoples"" being applied in Europe is a quite weird too. Are all Europeans not native to Europe?

It is true, however, that the Sami were treated quite badly historically. Their culture was looked down upon, and their language and religion was oppressed after the areas where Sami traditionally live were annexed into the Nordic countries. I am sure one can find dozens of European examples of smaller culture groups being oppressed by a larger culture group annexing their land and forcefully joining them into the larger group.

incapablepanda,texas-flag,Texas,"that's typically how a dictatorship works, although a keen observer would be quick to note that in a fully developed communist society, there would exist neither class nor state. Lenin championed the unification of the working people across europe and was quite concerned with his revolutionary buddy stalin's disproportionately growing power even as he (stalin) did dumb shit in georgia. it was never ""the plan"" for the USSR to have one dictator. lenin was certainly a leader in the revolution and after but lived in pretty austere accommodations and didn't care for the luxury that some of his successors are associated with. He also didn't like the personality cult that was built up around him but reluctantly admitted it might be ok for the sake of advancing the communist ideology.

in short, it's a bit like saying ""democracy is awful, just look at trump!"" you're always going to have people who seek to empower and enrich themselves. some ideologies are more easily exploited than others, but that doesn't make them inherently *bad*. people in the USSR were expected to work. people were, ideally, supposed to be provided for according to their need. that didn't always work out for this or that reason (one being that a lot of the country's production and GDP, a higher % of their GDP than we spent of ours went to cold war efforts, though we spent more overall). people were paid. people were allowed to own things, including toothbrushes. people were provided with healthcare the best that the country could manage. all told, with the enormous economic power of the western world standing against them, i think they did pretty well.

Induction tops have plummeted in price in Norway over the last 5 years, and you get great cooktops from Siemens and Bosch for about 300 USD.

Most of them are 50/60 hz compatible. ~~E.g.  https://products.bsh-partner.com/picenterext/specsheet/GB/en-GB/PKE611D17E.pdf?errorUrl=http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/no-documentation-available~~

What I would do is to get hold of a European type cooktop from one of the well known brands Siemens, Bosch or Electrolux, and drop that into your kitchen bench. But compare prices with a European online store first.

**Edit**: I was mistaken, the one I linked is a ceramic. But there are affordable good induction tops out there, and they have plummeeed in price. The cheapest Bosch retails at £529 in the UK, http://www.bosch-home.co.uk/product-list/cooking-baking/hobs/induction-hobs/PUE611BF1B?breadcrumb=inductionhobs 

Siemens also has some nice cook tops, and they are a step below Bosch in price.

Piellar,,,"Quelque morceaux de plus :

 * Guy Ouellette travaillait sur un projet de loi qui forcerait l'UPAC à rendre des comptes régulièrement à l'Assemblée Nationale, ce qu'elle n'a pas à faire actuellement. 

 * Guy Ouellette a été arrêté sans mandat, ses objets électroniques qu'il utilise dans son travail ont été saisis, et le fait qu'il ait été arrêté l'a immédiatement retiré de sa position politique de membre du caucus. Ça ne sera probablement pas réglé d'ici l'année prochaine, où il ne pourra pas se présenter dans son comté aux élections étant donné qu'on ne sait pas pourquoi il a été arrêté, et l'UPAC ne veut pas le dire. Bref, Guy Ouellette est politiquement parlant sur le respirateur artificiel sans qu'il puisse se défendre car il ne connaît pas les charges.

 * Hypothèse qui fait capoter tout le monde à l'Assemblée: Si l'UPAC peut arrêter n'importe quel élu parlementaire pour le faire taire sans avoir à dire quoi que ce soit à personne, ils peuvent littéralement manipuler les activités politiques des élus au parlement en suivant les dossiers et en ""cannant"" les élus qui poussent des projets de loi qui déplaisent à l'UPAC ou les opposants de ce qu'elle désire. Ça ferait que les élus du Gouvernement du Québec n'auraient aucun réel pouvoir et on va vers une dérive totalitaire dirigée par une police intouchable. 

C'est pour ça que tous les élus, tous partis confondus, et le président de l'Assemblée lui-même, demandent des vrais réponses de l'UPAC (et on n'en a pas eu, voir leur déclaration vide).  De plus:

 * Je rappelle au passage que le gendre du dirigeant de l'UPAC Robert Lafrenière est le patron de la Sûreté du Québec. Normalement ça serait juste ""inhabituel"". Là ça paraît moins bien.

 * Je rappelle aussi que c'est Jean Charest qui a parti ce beau bordel en ne mettant pas de garde-fous à l'UPAC à sa création.

Bref, je trouve ça personnellement très inquiétant. On veut que l'UPAC arrête des méchants, mais il faut qu'ils travaillent comme du monde et que le pouvoir exécutif (représenté ici par nos policiers) ne puisse pas saboter le pouvoir législatif (nos élus à l'Assemblée).

Also supposes equal desire to emigrate from their home country across every country. 

You're telling me the percentage of population and degree of desire of an Irishman to come to the United States during the 1840's-1860's was the same as that of a Frenchman, and the same as a Polynesian?

So that's wrong.

&gt; The country was ~95% white up until 1965 as a result.

The country hasn't been 95% white since the 17th century when there was only a hundred thousand settlers here.

We started off as a country at 80% White in 1750, and it decreased more and more as we went.

So that's wrong.

&gt;This idea that the success of America has always depended on poor brown immigrants is a complete fantasy.

This is just patently false.

The economy of the south was on the verge of collapse until the cotton gin made the economic engine of slavery profitable.

And it's not just brown people, the Chinese built the west half of the Transcontinental Railroad, but the Irish built the east.",True,0,1509568060,,False,0,dp7fubk,False,t3_7a416j,t1_dp7ehce,/r/news/comments/7a416j/terror_suspect_laughs_about_incident_from/dp7fubk/,1512027129,0,False,news,t5_2qh3l,public,

waterloograd,,,"The United States would ask its longtime friend and next-door neighbour Canada to go, but after, realizing what Minnesota, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California are attached to, Canada says sorry and awkwardly walks over to the EU. Canada has wanted to join this group for a while but its older sibling, the UK, has always been there. Now that the UK freaked out and threatened to leave, Canada feels like it is their chance to make their move. 

On its way over it passes Greenland and Iceland and says ""Sorry, just gonna sneak past ya here"" and makes its way to France. Canada has always been close to France, they share a common language. They have been close ever since Germany was drunk that one weekend and was trying to have their way with France. Unfortunately, Canada arrives too late, Spain has already asked France to prom. France had to say yes, Spain just lost a toe and is still recovering and trying to get it reattached.

Hit hard by this, Canada decides to go to prom alone. On the night of prom, Canada is getting ready and hears a horn outside. Its the Netherlands, with a big bouquet of tulips, and a tandem bike. Canada stands there, feeling like an idiot for not remembering the Netherlands, downs a beer, grabs a mickey of whiskey and runs outside.

At the prom, Canada and the Netherlands step outside for some fresh air. After checking if the coast is clear, Canada brings out the whiskey and offers some to the Netherlands. In return, the Netherlands brings out a perfectly rolled joint. Together they site under the moonlight enjoying the peace and quiet. 

After a while, they hear a thunderous noise and realize immediately the United States has smelled the weed and is storming over. They have always had a thing against drugs. They even broke into Columbia's house when they found out they were making cocaine and confiscated it pretending like they were better than them and totally not just going to use it themselves. The United States goes crazy, claiming if they have any more they are going to die and they are going to ruin their countries. Canada has had enough, steps up, takes a long drag on the joint and says ""I saw you smoking out on the west coast, you can't tell us not to smoke"". Embarrassed, and realizing they have no power in this situation, the United States walks away furious. 

Towards the end of the night, everyone leaves and goes to the after party at Germany's house. Germany has been trying desperately to make it up to everyone after that drunk weekend. They always throw great parties and supply everyone with amazing beer. Everyone is having a blast until Russia shows up. While Russia has some friends at the party, most of the attendees are not on the greatest terms with them. Surprisingly, the United States welcomes them, they have somehow turned their relationship around without anyone knowing. Everyone is talking about Russia and the United States, they hated each other months ago.

As the night reaches midnight everyone is tense. Things were said that shouldn't have been, a couple countries got into small fights. The United States usually stepped in to support whichever side it liked better. Russia and the United States usually disagreed about everything all night and went out into the street and started fighting. As the clock strikes midnight everyone hears sirens and looks up to see the bright searchlight of the police helicopter. The downdraft is strong and everyone gets very cold. Everyone knows they are doomed but they try to run anyways. Everyone is arrested, even those who were in the basement playing board games and minding their own business.

As their parents collect them from the police station everyone is grounded and has strict curfews. No internet lights out at sundown, no cellphones, and everyone goes to bed hungry. A few countries are neighbours and can talk between their bedroom windows, but everyone feels isolated. It is going to take a while before they can talk with their friends again and everyone wish Russia and the United States didn't get nuclear with each other.

dmstewar2,,,"This is an incorrect understanding of Arabic. Arabic, (and some other Semitic languages) has an adjectival form called the ""elative"" whereas most Indo-European ones have the ""comparative"" and ""superlative"" to show relative values of adjectives.

The word Kbir (كبير)) means big, and the ""elative"" Akbar (أكبر) means bigger AND biggest. You use other words to make it clear if it's intended to be a comparative adjective or a superlative.

If you want to compare something, you usually use the word ""Min"", which basically means ""than"". Al-zarida ahsan da min da. This newspaper is better than that one. 

If you want to say it's the best, you drop the article Al, and just say Zarida Ahsan, or something else depending on where you're from.

Allah is weird because it's already a contraction of Al-Ilah, (The God), so it has no article. This means in this context the elative has a superlative meaning in English.

So, yes I agree context and words matter. Therefore the whole ""My god is bigger than yours (he brings all the boys to the yard)"", argument is out the window. 

I don't really want to touch the politics of the second paragraph, but you should know, and I say this from having lived in Muslim/Arab countries for 20+ years, that they say Allahu Akbar all the fucking time. It's like ""Praise Jesus"" for evangelicals. Did well on a test, Allahu Akabar, plan to do well on a test, En-Shallah. Hope to do well on a test Al-Hum-dil-illah.

naatemic,florida text,Florida,"This has a lot to do with the period during which one's ancestors migrated to the United States (and of course where from) and not just their first, second, third etc. generation status. It's also important to note that ""European"" is a very broad term and that all ""Europeans"" were not treated equally, especially during the influx of migrants entering the US at the turn of the century.

My great-grandparents on both sides of my family, for example, migrated in the 1890s from Italy - along with another 5-6 million or so Italians from during the late 19th and early 20th century - and my grandparents were natural born US citizens. 

At the time, however, the prevailing nativist social and political tide dictated that assimilation and integration was key to economic success, especially in light of some of the anti-immigrant (especially anti-Catholic) discourses in the decades prior.

For example, my grandfather (on my father's side) never learned any Italian as it was largely forbidden in the household and he was, in fact, never able to have a conversation with his own grandparents, since they spoke only Italian. It was a similar case on my mother's side, where Italian language learning was squashed when my grandparents and their siblings were born, regardless of the fact that my great grandparents (their parents) on both sides spoke nearly no English upon arrival.

Following the massive influx of non-Northwestern Europeans at the turn of the century, these popular attitudes were reinforced with the introduction of literacy tests, quotas and other legal frameworks and requirements in the early to mid-20th century, which heavily favored English-speaking, Northwestern European immigrants over Southern or Eastern European immigrants (Italians, for example) and largely barred African, Arab and Asian immigrants.",True,0,1509570037,,1509572927,0,dp7httt,False,t3_7a5m9w,t1_dp79pvx,/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/7a5m9w/how_common_is_it_for_americans_to_speak_the/dp7httt/,1512028140,10,False,AskAnAmerican,t5_2uah7,public,

The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting.

The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer.

And George Soros admitted to [bankrolling](http://www.hangthebankers.com/george-soros-admits-to-funding-the-ukraine-crisis/) the whole debacle:

George Soros told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria over the weekend he is responsible for establishing a foundation in Ukraine that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the country’s elected leader and the installation of a junta handpicked by the State Department.

“First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you during the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in eastern Europe and Poland, the Czech Republic. Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?” Zakaria asked Soros.

“Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now,” Soros responded

It is well-known, although forbidden for the establishment media to mention, that Soros worked closely with USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy (now doing work formerly assigned to the CIA), the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Freedom House, and the Albert Einstein Institute to initiate a series of color revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia following the engineered collapse of the Soviet Union.

“Many of the participants in Kiev’s ‘EuroMaidan’ demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros’ International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given ‘more than any other donor organization’ to ‘democratic transformation’ of Ukraine,” writes William F.

No they have every right to those lands.  They Settled and claimed those lands.  

Those lands were uninhabited when they got there.  The aboriginal peoples there were further inland and were very peaceful.  It was the Sub Saharan Africans from the North that started to move in and nearly wiped them all out.  

&gt; Boers can never have the moral high ground here even if they are being murdered. 

So The Rape and Murder of Innocent children is okay?

They were refused by Europe.  Europe and other Western nations refused them over the history of Apartheid, which was needed to build the nation and keep people safe.
