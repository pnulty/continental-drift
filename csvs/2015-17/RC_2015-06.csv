Since the topic of international business and finance is certainly one of the top concerns of the G7 (and four of the members are EU states), it makes sense that the issue of Greece's financial instability would be a forefront topic of the meeting since further destabilization could have significant impact on all of the G7 economies.

If, as you suggest, the US were to step in and offer bailout plans to Greece, that would be a direct indictment of EU governance and a serious insult to all her members. I do not think that would pass lightly.

The EU should find a solution to Greece's economic issues, and the US should not interfere. But the US should certainly be free to speak to the urgency of action and the global impact of failing to act.

The union was agreed to in the basis of a union of countries, not the consumption of smaller countries by the larger partner. The former would never have been agreed to, and if it were proposed today, it would be rejected at the polls, even in England I suspect.

The thing is, that talk of a family of nations was just window dressing in large part.. We had become, for the most part a unitary state, even though we retained our own national institutions and law books etc. But since devolution, we are a unitary state, with an element of federalism inserted.. It is possible for some to argue we are a single unitary state, and others to argue we are a semi federal collection of nations. In truth we aren't either, but rather a messy place in between. 

But we entered the EU as a unitary state, and, despite precedent for partial withdrawal (Greenland) I think this would be a constitutional nightmare for the UK, and in practice we have to accept that as far as EU membership is concerned we will leave or stay as a single member.

I disagree. It is proportional to the GNP, you being the second biggest contributor is, guess what, directly connected to you being the second largest economy in the EU. Germany is not 'crippled' by the payments despite being by far the largest contributor to the EU budget. Since 1990, Germany has payed about 190 billion euros more than it recieved, which is around 45% of all net payments since then. I do understand the need for some kind of discount due to the specifics of the UK economy, however I would argue that a discount that is putting them below France and even Italy in net payments is a bit unfair.

Ethridge argues that before contact, skeletal remains indicate confrontations between chiefdoms were conducted to earn war trophies, and resulted in ""relatively indiscriminate slaughter"". Obtaining such trophies, usually human body parts, brought prestige to the warrior. Gallay and Brooks place the taking of captives as a long-standing aspect of warfare throughout the Eastern Woodlands. They argue adult male captives typically faced ritual torture and eventual death, while children and female captives were integrated into the captor's social environment.

In the historic period we still see evidence that male captives were killed as before, but in the late 17th and early 18th century women and children were kept alive and brought back to their captor's settlement. The role of the captive varied from forced labor with no social rights to full adoption into the kin group, being used as gifts of alliance, being used for ransom, or used to foster trade alliances. For some groups, like the Iroquois, mourning wars served as a way to quicken their dead and replace lost relatives. Unlike our version of slavery, these captives were adopted into the social structure of the settlement in the place of the deceased loved one.

Gallay states, ""Europeans did not introduce slavery or the notion of slaves as laborers to the American South but instead were responsible for stimulating a vast trade in humans as commodities.  Because of their previous history of raiding for captives, many southern Indians adapted to European slave trading practically overnight."" Where before captives were perhaps a measure of prestige, or a means of recouping lost loved ones, the slave trade out of Carolina changed the role of captives into that of commodities, leading to the transformation of the U.S. Southeast, the collapse of the Mississippian chiefdoms, and the rise of confederacies like the Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee.

It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other sweet foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BC. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolÄtl, a Nahuatl word meaning ""bitter water"". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, pure chocolate in rough form. Because the cocoa mass is usually liquefied before being molded with or without other ingredients, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Unsweetened baking chocolate (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.

Chocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created. Chocolate chip cookies have become very common, and very popular, in most parts of Europe and North America.

&gt;Political-economy of the USSR

-Widespread corruption within the Soviet political-economy leading to shortages and a general breakdown in the economy. 

-Attempts at liberal market reforms that were essentially incompatible with a planned economy.

-The era of stagnation left the Soviet Union and East Europe behind their western counterparts after the gains they made from the 40's until the early 70's. [Despite being stagnant the Soviet Economy did technically continue to grow until 1990, just one year before the nation was officially dissolved.](http://imgur.com/MoeiJOY) 

-Gorbachev's attempts at democratizing the USSR only destabilized it more.

-The Soviet War in Afghanistan bankrupted the nation and a lot of men and money was wasted that could have gone to anything from medical research to improving agriculture. 

&gt;The Oligarchs 

-Many people didn't even care about communism anymore, most people weren't even disenfranchised, they just didn't care. 

-Greedy bureaucrats pushing for privatization. 

-Yeltsin's coup. 

&gt;Other

-Ethnic nationalism in the Baltic states and Caucasus region. [Most places in the USSR voted to stay together as a new kind of union but a few smaller republics did not participate and had declared their independence.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_referendum,_1991). However each republic had its nationalists.  

-External pressure, the USA and even some NGO's were involved in funding and assassinating resistance movements in Eastern Europe. 

-The government could have probably called out the military and put down the rioters but Gorbachev felt it was better not to. 

Admittedly the Soviet Union collapsing was a strange event that could have been avoided had Gorbachev decided to focus on reforming and improving socialism along with punishing corruption instead of trying to create a nordic-style social democracy. Had they done this they may have salvaged it. In 1985 when he took power the Soviet Union was one of the most stable nations on Earth, the planned economy was still working, the economy was growing, most services worked, and the USSR was essentially at its peak in international influence. 

My family remembers that between 87/89 social services stopped working with shelves becoming emptier. Riots were more frequent and harder to put down and the system was collapsing. The utilities, stores, infrastructure and medical care which were all behind the West's which had at one time at least been accessible were now becoming scarcer.  By 1990 the Soviet Union only existed on paper and separatists were declaring their independence.  ",0,communism101,False,1433122289,16,1433507343,,16,1433123411,

Haha yes. I bet you thought you were done with me! I was going to make this really short, thinking it would be the reiteration of the same old points, but there seems to be new things you've brought in to the conversation, so, I went ahead and addressed more than I thought I would.

&gt;In any case even if you could demonstrate that these were continuous differences, you fall for the continuum fallacyâ âto erroneously reject a vague claim simply because it is not as precise as one would like it to be.

No. That's not correct. Saying that goes against our definitions and procedures of taxonomic classification. Trying to say our current way of taxonomically classifying organisms is a fallacy *doesn't work* for this argument. That's like saying it's a fallacy to pay attention to significant figures - our methods of taxonomic classification are a vital part of correct scientific procedure where anthropology is concerned. Were this a philosophical debate, perhaps that would be applicable. But this is an issue of scientific understanding, not philosophical or political debate.

&gt;recognise that race is real, even if you canât face calling it race.

I can face calling it race so long as you can face that there is no scientific justification for declaration of different subspecies, and that these ""racial differences"" rely on our social definitions of race rather than any scientific evidence. Then, absolutely, I'll call it race, same as I'd call your theory on why one show is better than another a theory, so long as you understand that it's a theory based on our social understanding of the word rather than our scientific understanding.

&gt;Ever noticed you donât tend to get gingers or people with blue eyes in Asia?

But we do get people with straight black hair and brown eyes elsewhere geographically which is a great example of *non-discrete*, phenotypic geographic distribution... 

Also again, I said lactose intolerance, height, brain size, etc, *not just skin color* are *also* non-discrete ways to classify people - so, those are some examples of things other than skin color that still do not work as justification for subspecies.

(Fun fact, the gene for red hair color/light skin has been found in *Homo neanderthalensis* and *appears* to have arisen in *Homo sapiens* as a result of interbreeding between neanderthals and *Homo sapiens* around the middle east and southeastern Europe ~ 30,000-27,000 years ago.)

&gt;

    I agree great hypotheses are important, but (â¦) in order to find scientific fact, agreement is vital.

&gt; Sometimes a paradigm shift is needed and generally its been a few individuals, going against the grain, who have initiated themâeg- Einstein or Copernicus. 

Yes, but an argument of scientific skepticism does not invalidate current scientific agreement and fact. Also, it's worth re-stating, the point of the scientific method is to find these universal truths of scientific facts, which do not vary depending on who you ask. Scientific skepticism is important, but skepticism for skepticism's sake is useless when trying to argue current scientific understanding and agreement. 

&gt;I think ideological concerns are actually bounded up in that paradigm â partly fear of the science covering the issue becoming eugenicist if race is recognised as being real. 

Actually, currently the conclusions are based upon understanding that our attempts to justify subspecies scientifically have gone outside of acceptable procedural interpretation. We're realizing that the variation we see within *Homo sapiens* is just that - variation - not different subspecies. Do you realize how long anthropologically we've been attempting to justify the existence of human subspecies? If anything, current understanding is more ""against the grain"" than any attempt to justify human subspecies is. When you make statements like that, it appears to me you're letting your preconceptions about certain political ideologies/groups get the better of your argument...

&gt;Its not even a problem with the since the evidence is not the issue, itâs the conclusions/interpretations of it that are the issue.

Absolutely. Hence our issues with trying to use science to create subspecies distinctions. Conclusions were taken out of context, and were drawn before we had Darwinian theory and an understanding of these differences.


&gt;The disagreement between us is not one of a gap of knowledge, but of you stubbornly sticking to the current paradigm despite it being logically flawed. 

I've said it before, I'll say it again, it's not about any paradigms, it's about current scientific understanding. I've also made a point before which seems to be necessary to sort of make again, though I mean no disrespect;  the difference in our ability to agree strikes me as similar to those who would like to claim global warming doesn't exist. We've come to a particular scientific understanding currently, which some find disagreeable, but whether anyone likes it or not, we need *evidence* to disprove any current theories which are widely agreed upon, not discussion about political agendas. Sticking to old theories and saying ""you're just trying to be politically correct/push an agenda"" just doesn't work as an argument against global warming. 

So that's part of the issue, there very plainly *is* some knowledge/factual discrepancy going on here between us.


Just out of curiosity, can you give me the current scientific sources from which you've derived your claims?

Definitely not. 

TV:

- for domestic issues, **Extra3** is probably the best satirical show. They love annoying the right-wing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGfpSi5ZZNI), they sent a famous drag queen to a party congress of the far-right NPD. 

- a younger satirical show is **Neo Magazin Royale**. They got famous for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afl9WFGJE0M) and the [follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx-1LQu6mAE), in which they claimed that they were behind the middle finger fabrication.

Magazines/Onion:

- [**Der Postillon:**](http://www.der-postillon.com/) An online satirical website that is not all about politics. Very light-hearted content. Similar to The Onion. However, they managed to score a few coups similar to the ones of Neo Magazin Royale. Current headlines: ""Liechtenstein constructs a high-speed train that crosses the country within 15 minutes"" ""Due to overfishing: Fish fingers threatened by extinction"" ""NSA complains about bad spelling in German e-mail traffic""

- **Titanic:** Personally, I do not like the content of this magazine. It tends to be [quite offensive](http://www.ksta.de/image/view/2010/3/24/12721778,11921724,dmData,maxh,480,maxw,480,me_TitanicTitelblatt+%25281270763970779%2529.jpg) (""Church nowadays"") for German standards.

The only thing that I remember being good was [this title picture](http://www.tageswoche.ch/images/cms-image-001517345.jpg) (""East-Germany-Gaby euphoric (GDR): My first banana"").

crrhebf,t3_37zzth,t5_2ssp3,,0,,t3_37zzth,Commiefornia,t1_crrhebf,0,False,"The Soviet Army was largely ineffective in Afghanistan. Granted, they did have small successes with Air-Assault formations and Special Forces.

I'll outline the Soviet Army's shortcomings with the following:

1. The Soviet Army of 1980 was trained and equipped for large scale, conventional warfare in Central Europe against a similar opponent. As such, the Soviets fought against the Mujahideen using their Armored and Motor-Rifle formations, which proved extremely ineffective against a small scale guerrilla enemy who used hit-and-run tactics in the rough terrain of Afghanistan. These large formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily meshed back into the terrain. 

2. The Russians used large scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which didn't really result in much, other than temporarily clearing those sectors. The biggest shortcoming here was the fact that once the Russians did engage the enemy in force, they failed to hold the ground by withdrawing once their operation was completed. Also, their practice of clearing territory, which entailed killing of civilians in addition to enemy combatants, resulted in a failure to actually defeat the enemy in the long term. 

3. The Soviets didn't have enough men to properly occupy and pacify Afghanistan. The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000 in the 40th Army, which consisted of a mere 5 divisions. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but the fact that   there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly. 

4. This point ties in with incorrect employment. Intelligence gathering is essential to a successful COIN campaign. The Soviets over-relied on aerial recon and radio intercepts while using their recon infantry and special forces in direct combat roles. This gave them very inaccurate intel reports. Although their special forces and recon inf, performed very well in combat against the Mujahideen, they would have better served in intelligence gathering. 

Now as I mentioned earlier, the Soviets did have one effective method during the war. Their use of Air Assault (Helicopter-borne) infantry, such as the VDV, in conjunction with their ground forces, was very effective in assaulting Muj strongholds in the rough and mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. Helicopters could move fast and allowed for rapid insertion of infantry to encircle and destroy Muj forces. Likewise, the helicopter insertion of Spetsnaz teams to interdict and ambush Muj fighters was also effective.

crrhx7d,t3_37xh25,t5_2yfm0,,0,,t3_37xh25,Too_Many-Chimps,t1_crrhx7d,0,False,"Honestly, I'm saddened by the decline of the Southern Baptist church. It took me a long time to get here though.
I was raised in the church &amp; attended until I was 16 years old. As a teenager I hated the church. It seemed like everything I thought was fun was considered sinful. Many people seemed snobby &amp; hypocritical too. I stopped going to church, fell for the cultural marxist programming, &amp; eventually became a liberal atheist.

I don't know what it is about leftist beliefs that attracts people in my age group, but so many of us embraced a belief system that contributes to the death of our own society. Maybe it is a mix television/internet, control of education, &amp; the appearance of being cool.

Back then, it would have been unthinkable that the church would be in the shape that it is in now. The Southern Baptist church was monolithic. It was the religion for the majority of white Christian southerners. There were several churches in every city &amp; some had members ranging into the thousands. It seemed like it was an eternal institution that could never be defeated. For that reason, I hated it.

At 29 years old I have a much more right wing world view &amp; have embraced the southern culture that I once loathed as teenager. I have renounced liberalism &amp; its religion of equality, am no longer a brave fedora wearing atheist, own as many guns as I can afford, proud to be of European descent &amp; damn proud to be a white southerner. I still can not bring myself to believe in the supernatural but I realize that Christianity played a major part of what made Europe &amp; its people great to being with. The religion unites us &amp; makes us strong against outsiders. I guess I am culturally Christian. It is too bad it took me almost 12 years to realize it.

The Southern Baptist denomination has become another victim of the degeneracy constantly pushed by the left. That southern culture that seemed so strong &amp; monolithic just 15 years ago is now weakened &amp; headed towards oblivion. Back then I never would have imagined the church compromising its values &amp; embracing multi-culturalism.

Because this bears greatly upon my ability to induct myself into whatever society I am introducing myself to, and promote the idea that I am worthy to be something other than a victim of the mines of Greece (or what have you).  
  
Potentially, being *unkillable* is quite the trick to show off, after all.  Especially because it presumably likewise implies I'm a deadly warrior (to the extent that unstoppable things that hold a sword will tend to be).

crris6e,t3_37zfdq,t5_2v3da,,0,,t3_37zfdq,VaderVsSauron,t1_crris6e,0,False,"Preface: Putin becomes obsessed with the idea that a major war with the West is inevitable. He begrudgingly admits that without using his nuclear arsenal, Russiaâs military probably canât defeat the combined might of NATO. He decides that he must strike first, and orders his commanders to begin drafting war plans. Within a few weeks a strategy emerges â Russia will launch simultaneous full-scale surprise attacks on Ukraine, the Baltics and Alaska. Itâs basically just an extreme version of what worked with the Crimea annexation â a surprise blitz, a quick occupation, then sue for peace before NATO can coordinate a counterattack. Itâs risky, but the linchpin was the assumption that everyone in the Western world would be losing control of their bladders for fear of imminent nuclear apocalypse. This territorial expansion would accomplish several of Putinâs core geostrategic objectives (i.e. buffer zone in Eastern Europe, foothold in North America) and put Russia in a much stronger position to defeat the West the next time around. Putin believes Alaska is strategically vital: the Russian Navy is desperate for warm water ports and the untapped oil fields will be crucial for a sustained war effort. Additionally, he thinks an attack on the homeland will distract the Americans from the theater in Eastern Europe. 


In the weeks leading up to the surprise attack, Putin delivers a series of fiery nationalistic and anti-Western speeches. Several times he asserts that Russia isnât afraid of a few mushroom clouds. Putin also bans all Western media sources. Several prominent opposition leaders are arrested on trumped-up charges. Finland and Sweden reject Russian offers of non-aggression pacts. 


Russiaâs surprise attack on Alaska comes at a time in which the vast majority of Americans are completely off-guard: 5:00 PM on the Fourth of July. The invasion is preceded by a massive cyberattack on American and Canadian power grids, temporarily bringing them offline and delaying a counterattack. Wave after wave of bombers destroy airfields and military bases throughout the state. Thousands of paratroopers capture Anchorage and Juneau Red Dawn-style while special forces units take control of critical infrastructure. Within two days civilians are being rounded up at gunpoint and herded into internment camps. The Russian Navy moves to seize control of shipping lines in the Bering Sea. The initial strike cripples Americaâs military capabilities in Alaska, which falls to Russian control within a week. Any surviving servicemen and Alaskan citizens not in camps melt into the bush and go into full guerilla warfare mode. The Russians immediately begin moving in the equipment needed to drill for oil on the North Slope. 


Meanwhile, in Europe: Russian bombs fall on Kiev day and night. Within two weeks there are Russian tanks on the Maidan Square. The Estonian and Latvian governments collapse after a week of sustained carpet bombing. Putin has declared martial law in Russia, dissolved the duma and outlawed all political parties except United Russia. With the Russian flag flying over Kiev, Tallinn and Riga, Putin attempts to broker a ceasefire with NATO, but is completely ignored. Both China and India strongly condemn Russian aggression but maintain neutrality. 


NATOâs immediate response is to launch attacks on Russian naval units in the North Sea and Arctic Ocean. Polish and Russian warplanes dogfight over the skies of Ukraine while U.K. fighters scramble to intercept Russian planes north of Scotland. German, Hungarian and Romanian tank and troop divisions prepare to launch a counteroffensive into Ukraine. 


Back in America: After a week of frantic scrambling, the power grid is coming back online. Obamaâs first priority is to retake Alaska. Miles-long columns of American and Canadian forces begin advancing north on the newly militarized West Coast highway system, while U.S. and Russian naval units clash in the North Pacific. Russiaâs ability to access North Slope oil is hampered by guerillas who frequently bomb remote stretches of pipeline. 


A month into the war: Before this all started, Putin was sure NATO would back down, and his craziness was just tempered enough to prevent them from doing anything. Now he feels like heâs losing control of the situation. Polish forces have occupied Kaliningrad and invaded Belarus. A combined NATO tank force is pushing towards Kiev. The U.S. Navy has begun a blockade of Russia in the Atlantic while Turkey does the same in the Black Sea. Skirmishes are breaking out along the Russo-Finnish border. Chunks of Alaska are starting to fall back into American hands after Russiaâs defeat at the decisive Battle of Anchorage. 


Four months into the war: Putin is beginning to panic. Alaska has been liberated. Belarus has fallen. He was able to break NATOâs siege of Russian-occupied Kiev, but suffered heavy losses. There is a bloody insurgency raging all across Ukraine (which NATO supplies with weaponry and intelligence). The naval blockade has gotten so bad Russia is forced to ration food. Whispers about a possible coup are growing louder. China flatly refuses Putinâs pleas to enter the war on his side. He's desperate enough that he briefly considers offering them a chunk of Siberia in exchange for a declaration of war on NATO, but decides against it. NATO has begun massing its forces in Kaliningrad and on the Russo-Belorussian and Polish-Ukrainian borders. 


Six months into the war: Western Ukraine, Latvia and Estonia have all fallen back into NATOâs hands. The Russian military was routed from the Baltics after its humiliating defeat at the Battle of Riga. NATO forces have begun moving into Russian territory. Putinâs analysts are convinced they are simply waiting out the winter to strike for the Russian heartland. Air raids over Moscow and St. Petersburg are becoming increasingly common and civilian causalities have been high. Thousands of people rally in Red Square demanding an end to the war and that Putin step down. Security forces open fire on the crowds, killing over 300 people. Russiaâs defeat seems imminent. Western leaders are openly discussing plans to break the post-war Russian Federation into a dozen smaller nations.


Somewhere in the North Atlantic: A fanatically nationalistic Russian submarine captain finally snaps. He tells his crew that Russia is losing this war while Putin cowers in his underground bunker too afraid to utilize nuclear weaponry in defense of the Motherland. He goes rogue and launches a nuclear missile that explodes over New York City. This very quickly devolves into a full nuclear exchange between NATO and Russia. The world goes to hell. North Korea invades the South. Israel nukes Tehran and the Mideast erupts in chaos. Pakistan and India also exchange a few nukes. 


A year later: The atomic finale of World War III ushered in a devastating nuclear winter. Global agricultural output plummets, resulting in severe famines across the world. The governments of America, Russia and Europe have all collapsed. Despite their neutrality India and China are also hit especially hard by famine, and both countries eventually implode in Malthusian anarchy. At least two billion have died from the firestorms, radioactive fallout and starvation. 


100 years later: Global population hovers around 3.5 billion. The Northern Hemisphere has never recovered. North America and much of Eurasia are desolate radioactive wastelands. In the aftermath of this terrible war, the South American Union became the worldâs dominant power, though its international reach was limited to a modest blue-water navy patrolling the sea lanes and a network of alliances with the dozen or so functioning nation-states that still existed â chiefly New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Indonesia. Critical shortages of nonrenewable resources made salvage one of the few growth industries of the era; an enterprising salvage merchant who know how to barter with the villagers and nomads of the stateless zones for scrap technology from the ruined cities could become rich in a single voyage. Important as they were, these salvaged technologies were only accessible to the few. The Union and a few other nation-states still kept some aging military aircraft operational, but maritime traffic once again was carried by tall ships, and horse-drawn wagons become a standard mode of transport on land away from the railroads. Radio communication had long since taken over from the last fitful fragments of the Internet, and electric grids were found only in cities.

Swiped from /u/ggow


ââââââââ

The General Procedure

When it comes to the budget, the first thing that happens is they define how much to spend, negotiated amongst the Europarliament, eurocommission, and the council of ministers. The revenue for that is then raised in a number of ways, and primarily from three sources (with the other around 1% coming from fines, interest on late payments, tax on EU staff and so on). 

The first source is what are known as 'traditional own resources'. As you may be aware, the EU is, amongst other things, a customs union. The import duties, levies and tariffs are thus paid at one point for brining products in to the area. Those all go to fund the EU. 

The second source is what is known as a 'VAT call'. In essence, most countries pay 0.3% of their VAT tax take to the EU in order to pay for the EU's activities. (This is one of the main reasons why the EU has harmonised VAT law (read: there are very strict rules on what is taxed for VAT, what the rates of VAT can be, and what exemptions can exist). 

The third source is a contribution based on each member state's GNI. The value raised from all of the other sources are summed and subtracted from the amount identified as being required in the budget negotiations. That difference is then raised by allocating a fee to each state based on their relative share of the EU's total GNI. For example, if member state A has a GNI share of 10% of the EU's GNI, they must pay 10% of the identified shortfall. (You may remember that the UK had to pay more money to the EU recently due to our GDP being revised up with the inclusion of prostitution etc. It is this part of the budget process that caused that to be necessary.)

ââââââââ

The Rebates

Once the above general procedure has been applied, there are correcting procedures put in place. 

1. As you'll be aware, the UK enjoys a rebate on what it pays into the EU budget. In simple terms, this is roughly 2/3ds of what the net contribution would be. The effect here, on the other member states, is to increase their contributions to the EU. This is, in the first instance, calculated on the GNI-based method mentioned above i.e. member state A would need to pay 10% of the rebate to the UK. 

2. Sweden, Austria, Germany, Netherlands enjoy a 'rebate on the rebate'. In essence, their contribution is calculated, but they then only have to pay 25% of it. The difference is redistributed around the other member states on the same GNI-share basis. 

3. These four countries also enjoy a reduction on their VAT call. As mentioned, member states usually have to pay 0.3% of their VAT take to the EU. Sweden, and the Netherlands only pay 0.1%, Germany pays 0.15% and Austria 0.225%. (The difference, of course, being made up in the usual GNI-share way). 

4. The Netherlands and Sweden enjoy a lump sum rebate on their GNI-based contributions. Once the sum has been calculated, the agreed rebate is subtracted, and then the shortfall for the budget made up in the usual way. 

ââââââââ

TL;DR 

â¢ Once the UK's rebate is calculated, each memberstate is expected to contribute to it in proportion to their means. The four countries above need only pay a quarter of that, with the burden then falling on the other memberstates to make up. 

â¢ each member state is expected to pay 0.3% of their total VAT take to the EU. The four countries only pay a reduced fraction (listed above). 

â¢ Netherlands and Sweden enjoy a discount on the portion of the budget that is calculated based on their relative means.

crrlshy,t1_crrerd4,t5_2qh1i,,0,,t3_380dwl,pat1million,t1_crrlshy,0,True,"A. Specifically, Asia is not an interchangeable word with the Orient. Oriental would be more accurately interchange with Asian Pacific Islands or Polynesia. 

B. It is much more difficult for anyone of any race to identify physical characteristics of those outside of that race (this is considered heavily in criminal identifications; I.e. If a person of European Descent identifies another person of European Descent as the perpetrator of a crime, that is depended upon more readily by law enforcement than if a person of European Descent identifies a person of African Descent as the perpetrator of a crime...in theory) SO, it is unlikely that someone from outside that group would be able to correctly identify a person of Polynesian Descent anyways, so the term ""oriental"" would likely be used incorrectly.

C. Culturally sensitive language changes over time which is why many people who might say 'person with African Descent' might cringe when another person says African American...going back far enough, you would feel totally sensitive because the said 'Negro' instead of 'nigger.' Hence, we don't see a lot of push for changing the names of The United Negro College Fund or The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - they were named at times when those terms were either currently culturally sensitive or even ahead of their time. That time for the term 'Oriental' has likely passed.

D. The modern day rule (which actually makes a lot of sense to me because, previously, it either seemed to be a cycle of terminology or a never ending quest to outmode previously correct terms) is to put the person first in one's terminology. For example: one is not autistic, one is a person with autism or a person who has autism. One is not European, one is from Europe. One is not Asian, one is of Asian Descent or one has Asian Ancestry. The idea being here is that what matters actually precedes what matters less, or rather the fact that we are friggin human beings matters more than being gay or straight, black or white or brown, male or female, Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Atheist, able bodied or disabled, rich or poor, smart or dumb, kind or mean, generous or selfish, etc. This system seems like the system that eliminates the cycle of lost-politically-correct-terms which is why I like it...although it does have it's drawbacks such as 'is it acceptable to refer to someone as something that no one seems to find offensive such as 'student'?' and how do we reconcile this kind of person-first language in other languages in which order is different because, while in English, it's Johnny's house, in Spanish, it might be casa de Johnny?

Yes, this is what I'm looking for.  Broadly I'd like to see counterpoint to the DE subreddit... what else should I be reading in order to balance it out.

I'll give an example of the sort of criticism I'm looking for.  The sidebar writes:

&gt;A system of No Voice-Free Exit in large hyper-federalist states or small independent city states is the optimal political arrangement. Singapore is an imprecise example with little political voice, but massive economic freedom and high levels of prosperity. City-states would be in constant competition for minds and business and risk losing economically valuable citizens and businesses if poorly run since they can easily relocate. This creates an incentive to remain economically and socially free.

As someone who hasn't spent much time in political theorizing, I can immediately think of a bunch of reasons this might be impractical:

* More sovereign nations might in the long run lead to more sovereign nations with nuclear weapons.  How do the game theoretic properties of the current equilibrium change with more nuclear states?  Everyone in the MSM seems to agree that nuclear proliferation is a bad idea.  I'm open to the possibility that nuclear proliferation among many small city-states is somehow a good idea, but this has to be argued.

* Global tragedy-of-the-commons type problems seem more difficult with more agents.  Cooperation gets harder when games have more players.  Overfishing &amp; global warming would be examples.  Let's leave aside the question of whether AGW is true (I suspect it is but I could be wrong).  The key question is whether your political system is robust to this kind of cooperation problem.  More states means incentives for any given state to help reduce carbon emissions is smaller; the commons is divided among many more parties.

* How do you deal with rogue states that don't allow free exit?  Is there any reason to expect that stateless people would find homes?  What about people that don't have marketable skills?  (I share the DE ""society design problem"" ethic.  But I'm sufficiently egalitarian to care about everyone's experience.)

* If small independent states are so great, why did Europe form the European Union?  Currency &amp; language issues are really significant frictional costs.  Part of the reason US startups do so much better than European ones is because US consumers are a nearly uniform 300M person market (they all speak English, pay with USD, and operate under a similar set of laws).

...and I'm sure I'd have more, if I *was* the kind of person who spent time with political theorizing.  That's what worries me.

Overall I just want some kind of ""loyal opposition"" that is motivated to bring up these kind of objections, and this sub seems underpopulated, so I was wondering where else to look.

(The situation would be a bit more tolerable if DE criticism wasn't restricted to this sub.  I totally understand the fear about entryists.  But I think the measures put in place might be *too* draconian.  Alternative set of proposals for your consideration: First, ban tactics not ideas.  Labeling things as ""racist"", ""sexist"", etc. gets you censored; citing studies on stereotype threat does not.  Second, choose new mods at random from existing active members.  That way you don't have your mod pool selected from entryists applying for modship.)

Maybe these proposals will get me labeled as one of the ""trying to seem reasonable left"", which frustrates me even more.  It's not nearly at SRS levels but it is a bit annoying to think people may reflexively label me this way.  ""Leftism is a cancer"" is a statement I'm willing to grant for the sake of discussion, but I'm not sure the best approach is shut it out with these kind of blunt tactics.  From a software engineer perspective, I'd say it's like trying to fix a bug without figuring out its root cause.  You're just commenting out all the calls to the buggy function or something like that.  More valuable would be to understand why the memetic landscape favors leftist memes (what bug in the landscape causes this) and then, after having solved the problem, apply a targeted patch.  (It seems clear to me that it's valuable for people to be compassionate towards one another, and to those that are different from them, and to take steps to prevent people being nasty to each other.  I think our instincts for altruistic punishment serve us well... mostly.  The SJW phenomenon seems like a corner case where they get co-opted.  So the patch doesn't necessarily need to be big.)",0,DebateDE,False,1433140158,2,1433511137,,2,False,

crrmaz1,t3_381gf4,t5_2sokd,,0,,t3_381gf4,pharmaceus,t1_crrmaz1,0,False,"Ok, let me chip in as an economist.... a very general explanation.

There are four ways a government can finance its operations:

*  **taxation** of income, wealth, trade

*  **borrowing** on the market or from the citizens

*  **state-owned enterprises** producing income such as monopolies or land sales.

*  **money creation**  which causes the so-called Cantillon effect (transfer of wealth through extraction of purchasing power from the existing money by increasing the amount of money in circulation)


The early US governments used all of those methods to finance the operations but the main one - since the rebellion was about taxation and not everyone was as rich as George Washington to just give their own money - was borrowing and money creation.

That was essentially the main reason behind the creation of the first Bank of the United States - to consolidate all the states' debt and state-issued money floating around and continue on the credit issued abroad. There was a very serious economic crisis resulting from the debt the US incurred fighting for independence.

In the subsequent years there was very little need for taxes because governments didn't need money for social services or the like. But in the 1820s and on there grew two movements - industrial protectionism and internal improvements - which required money. Some of that came through sale of land, some of that had to be collected through taxes.  The taxes at the time were mostly **tariffs**. Tariffs were import taxes - especially against foreign industrial production and it led to many conflicts along the North-South lines because North was undergoing intense industrialization and started to produce its own industrial goods while South was heavily agricultural but also export-oriented and it used its cotton production to buy everything it needed.  North wanted South to buy northern stuff and lobbied heavily for protectionist tariffs against British and other European products.

Over time - as North grew in population, wealth and influence they managed to pass more and more tariffs which the South really didn't like and it was one of the foundations of the upcoming war. By the time of the Civil War the overwhelming majority of the taxes in the federal budget would come from the tariffs (IIRC as much as 70%) the majority of which were paid by the then ""richer"" South so you can clearly see how the tariffs were going up and down depending on who currently held the advantage in the government. The taxes were actually quite severe - around 1830 the tariffs were close to 50% - although the US had a serious war debt to pay off (1812).

Still you have to remember that at the time the US government was practically nonexistent compared to the organization known today.  There was no large standing military and a fairly symbolic navy. There was no social security, no medicare, no agricultural subsidies, no apollo program etc.It was just a bunch of politicians, some bureucrats and some cronies. The idea that this was what government was supposed to look like was so strong that even after the Civil War (which cost a fortune and required both tarriffs, and income taxes, and debt and money printing, and confiscation) when the feds started the railroad subsidies they would subsidy it with land rather than direct financial investment and only create bonds and bond markets off of those land grants.

-----

As for the question whether it is possible to create a system where citizens aren't taxed. Yes it is - it is called **anarchic society** and depending whether you lean left or right it would be anarcho-collectivism or anarcho-capitalism.

Lets say I buy a lottery ticket every week. Lets say i buy 450 lottery tickers every week. And for the last couple of years, on average i make a profit every year. Because its an ongoing ""systematic"" and semi long term approach with net profit, can the government turn around and say, hang on, you have a system for winning the lottery, time to tax.

Poker is somewhat different, but none the less contains a large element of luck. For the government to effectively call poker a skill game, they would need to prove that despite the large luck factor, i am able to systematically overcome the random variation in the game and come out on top.

Like stocks, perhaps 90% of people who play poker are long term losers. The long term in poker can be anywhere from a handful of years to a lifetime of playing. If the vast majority of people who play poker are indeed losers, wouldn't it be absurd for the government to waste its time with a minority of ""winners"" who it then has to prove have the capacity to systematically beat a perceived luck based game?

The other question i have is regarding my losses.
According to my statistics i only win around 54% of sessions on average over a long period of time. Now the number is just slightly above what you would expect from a long term coin toss result for heads and tails. Meaning it would signify i do no better then anyone else in a game of chance.

Naturally that number is somewhat misleading as my wins are far larger then my losses and i could still be a big winner having won only 30% of my sessions also. But the question remains, i lose on average every second session. When reporting my wins and losses to the ATO, how would i even begin to handle the reporting of losses?

Do i say:

March +$15,000
April -$8400
May +$12,000
etc


Lets say one of my other income streams, which is a cash in hand coaching gig.

I do it maybe 5-10 hours a week and not always consistently. Lets say i make something like $20k from it per year. I declare that as my main job. But from poker which is my hobby i make lets say $100k+. Would that be a reasonable set up for tax purposes or would i need to classify the biggest earning activity as my profession.

Joe Hachem who won the world series of poker in 2005 for $7.5 million did not pay any tax on his winnings:

*""Australian poker champ Joe Hachem's lucky streak has continued with news he won't have to pay income tax on his $10 million winnings from Las Vegas because he was pursuing a hobby, not working.*

*The Melbourne father of four toppled American and European poker heavyweights by blitzing the World Series of Poker in July.*

*Hachem's lawyers said the Australian Taxation Office had found their client was not in the business of playing poker at the time of his win.*

*""As a result of this finding, the poker winnings were classified as income derived from a hobby, and thus not subject to Australian tax,"" his lawyer Peter Donovan said in a statement today.*

But the point is when you compare Qatar to South Africa or Brazil the conditions afforded to the workers in both South Africa and Brazil were not analogous to modern day slavery, whereas by all accounts in Qatar it is.  

Now, eight workers died in brazil due to accidents resulting from lax safety protocols, which is utterly unacceptable and to my knowledge no form of justice has ever come about for that. (Please correct me if wrong btw). Now while this is appalling from a cold hearted point of view there is difference between such accidents resulting because of lax safety and the governmental policies of Qatar that not only include major oppression of human rights for overseas migrant workers but also the oppression of women's rights, oppression of freedom of speech, oppression of journalism, and oppression of gay rights.  

Now it's their country, their rules, however, in my opinion, you should not be hosting the largest event on the planet in such a country who enforces such policies that the majority of the world finds morally reprehensible. (*Iran would perhaps be a viable option?? I've only ever heard great thing from those who have traveled to Iran, although the US would probably never let it happen, and I don't really know shit about Iranian culture to be fair, they could be just as bad. A world cup in Turkey would be awesome but I dunno if that constitutes as the middle east)  

And if other middle eastern countries, or any other countries in the world, would have the same issues for hosting a world cup as Qatar I also believe that they have utterly no right to host such a tournament.  

Then again, of course you can say ""Well the West and the developed world has no right to moral superiority on such issues"" and this argument does indeed have some weight to it as the US and every major European nation has an utterly appalling 20th century history of human rights violations, but this is 2015, and in 2015 the vast majority of the world realize that what is happening in Qatar is morally disgusting, *especially* considering the fact the Qatari government is more than wealthy enough to provide basic amenities and assurances of survival to their workers, which is something that makes Qatar stand alone in that sense - They *could* treat their workers well because they're rich as fuck, but, it would seem by all accounts that they simply choose not to.  

I'm ranting again, but it's an issue that does get to me. I'd be perfectly fine with a world cup in Qatar, as long as they didn't treat their workers like fucking slaves, along with the other issues I've already mentioned.   ",0,soccer,False,1433140964,114,1433511251,,114,1433318445,

Regarding your political analysis of Israel/Russia, I'd say that's debatable, not that Russia isn't more powerful than Israel, but Israel can bypass the US through China, and Europe is a meaningless collection of apologists who Israel is doing perfectly fine without - in terms of export and import, at least.

Like I said, debatable - but not here.

In regards to the ACTUAL matter, if both are clearly in the wrong, I would expect UEFA/FIFA to act accordingly and not involve politics or play favors, if both broke a rule, both must receive the same punishment.
If Russia gets away with murder, then I don't see how a person with your moral compass can claim that justice has been served, or be content with the way it has been handled. This is why Israelis feel they're being picked on, with Russia doing the same and people being apathetic about it, or Yemen doing 10x worse and people don't even know WHAT Yemen is.",0,Israel,False,1433143003,1,1433511520,,1,False,

The precursor to the European Union called the Pan European Union. The founder, Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi, said this in his book.

&gt;The man of the future will be of mixed race. The races and classes of today will gradually disappear due to the elimination of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-negroid race of the future, similar in appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples and the diversity of individuals. Instead of destroying European Judaism, Europe, against her will, refined and educated this people, driving them to their future status as a leading nation through this artificial evolutionary process. It's not surprising that the people that escaped from the Ghetto-Prison, became the spiritual nobility of Europe. Thus, the compassionate care given by Europe created a new breed of aristocrats. This happened when the European feudal aristocracy crashed because of the emancipation of the Jews [due to the actions taken by the French Revolution]

crrnteb,t1_crrnt9i,t5_2qh2v,,0,,t3_381rd6,Hanfresco,t1_crrnteb,0,False,"The historical figures and episodes described in the classical histories (especially the Zuo Commentary and Shiji) provided later Chinese thinkers with a common set of reference points through which to debate diplomacy and war. [8] The Chinese have ever been a precedent citing people, and you must work hard to find a memorial, recorded debate, or strategic treatise written in imperial times that does not reference these books profusely. They are simply necessary reference works for understanding Chinese political and military thought. All the sadder that an adequate translation has only been provided for one of them! Sima Qian's masterwork has actually been given two superb translations: the first, penned by Burton Watson in the 1960s, is a literary translation in 3 volumes that includes all of the chapters dealing with Qin (old style: Ch'in, 221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC-220 AD) history; the second, carefully put together by a team led by William Nienhauser, is a heavily annotated scholarly translation that is projected to be nine volumes in total once it has been completed.

The other histories have received less favorable treatment. The last complete translation of the Zuo Zhuan was published in 1872; the Han Shu, Hou Han Shu, and Zizhi Tongjian have received only partial translation, some quite old and usually limited to a chapter or two, while the San Guo Zhi has not been translated at all. 

A new translation of any of these books would be a huge endeavor. The Tongjian clocks in at 20 volumes in modern Chinese, and an English set would be the size of a small library. However, if academia mustered the resources to publish 40 volumes of Al-tarabi's History or the Sanskrit Clay Library's 60 volumes of material, then there is no reason a translation of the classical Chinese histories cannot be organized. 

 China's literary heritage, especially the great classical novels, is a another source of strategic insight, to a degree which is perhaps unique to China. After the close of the Warring States era and the rise of the scholar-bureaucracy in the mid Western Han dynasty (206 BC-9 AD), the social distinction between civil (wen) and martial (wu) grew very sharp and it became less fashionable for the philosophically inclined to discourse on the principles of war. Popular interest in the topic remained, however, and the demand to meet this interest was eventually filled by story-tellers, playwrights, and novelists. The great classical novels are the cream of this crop, hailed with the literary acclaim Westerners give The Illiad, but with the pop-culture presence of The Lord of the Rings.  Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) famously cited examples from the classic Ming Dynasty (1368-1664) adventure novel, Shui Hu Zhuan (old style: Shui-hu Chuan, variously translated as Water Margin, Outlaws of the Marsh, or All Men Are Brothers) when describing his own ideas on strategy and warfare. [9] I am unaware of any attempt to find or list the strategic insights Mao claimed could be found in the novel, though I would not be surprised if a Chinese scholar has taken a stab at it. I have come across Chinese attempts to draw out and categorize the strategic principles found in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (San Guo Yanyi, old style: San Kuo Yen-i) and cannot help but laud the effort. [10] Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the source of many of the recurring idioms and concepts of the Chinese strategic tradition (e.g. kong cheng ji, ""the empty fortress ruse"") and of all texts associated with the tradition it is probably the one that can claim greatest popularity and widest exposure across all sections of Chinese society in contemporary times. These novels portray popular attitudes towards war and strategy with an openness more dignified genres never could, and for this reason alone they are worth serious study. Thus far this study has mostly been done by those with a background in Chinese literature; unsurprisingly they have analyzed the novels in literary, not strategic, terms. [11] 

This brings us to the development of strategic thought in mid to late imperial China (defined here as 960-1912 AD). Though discourses on war were not as popular with the great Neo-confucian thinkers of late imperial times as they were with their ancient predecessors, history did not stop when Neo-confucianism rose ascendant. China still faced external security threats and the specter of internal rebellion. Literati involved in government--and at this time those who governed were almost all literati--still had to face the harsh questions of strategy. Their writings in response to these challenges could be quite voluminous. Strategic theory in late imperial times was most often expressed in what today we might call 'grand strategic' terms, with a focus on the social and economic basis of state power. These are the aspects of power with which mandarins living far from the frontier were most familiar with, and they were safely within the sphere of the 'civil.' There is a temptation to fault these men for their relative neglect of operational art and campaign strategy, but I do not think this should count too much against them. The treatises and memorials they wrote were quite sophisticated (and seem even more so when compared to what was being written by medieval European contemporaries), and had a lasting impact on the course of Chinese statecraft.

The state of English scholarship on these men and their doctrines is opposite of the scholarship on ancient Chinese strategic thought. Here many books and articles dissecting their theories of statecraft and describing their policy proposals have been written, but there is a dearth of translated material. [12] Thus every book on the Song Dynasty (old style: Sung, 960-1279 AD) has a lengthy section on Wang Anshi's (d. 1086) political program, but there is no complete translation of the celebrated series of memorials in which he laid this program out. The same pattern extends right up to studies on the cusp on the modern era. Wei Yuan (d. 1858), perhaps the most seminal strategic theorist of Qing (Ch'ing, 1644-1912) China, has had several books or articles written about him and is a regular feature of general surveys of the dynasty. [13] However, neither his most famous work on statecraft, nor the famous anthology of writings he collected and published, The Collected Essays on Statecraft of the Great Qing (Huang-Qing Jingshi Wenbian), has been translated into English. Short excerpts from Wang Anshi, Wei Yuan, and the many theorists who lived between them can be found in books like Sources of the Chinese Tradition and China's Response to the West: A Documentary Survey, but these are rarely more than a page or two long and are utterly insufficient for serious comparative study.

An amazing trick! Once you get level 3, wait for a good opportunity to jump on the enemy (normally i like mid lane!) then bring out your second meepo for an easy kill (net - poof 1 meepo, net poof 2nd meepo)!

Chain netting is all about timing, you just get a feel for it! (Same with micro, more games = becomes more natural).

Control groups (mine are interesting):  

* 1 for main meepo  
* 2 more second meepo  
* 3 for third meepo  
* 4 for fourth meeepo  
* 5 for fifth meepo  
* 6 for meepos 2 &amp;amp; 3  
* 7 for meepos 4 &amp;amp; 5  
* 8 for meepos 1 &amp;amp; 2  
* 9 for meepos 3 &amp;amp; 4  
* U for all other meepos (2,3,4,5)  
* 0 for illusions (manta or illu rune)

General playing tips:

Practice the blink poof combo (queue up your poofs and then blink on your target for instant-amazing damage, I love using QUICKCAST on meepo (and all heroes now) especially for this)

Make sure you are always farming/ splitpushing/ganking WITH EVERY MEEPO, this allows you to get over 10cs/min and lots of kills!

Any questions, feel free to ask me.

How is this the same as **prohibiting jobs that shouldn't exist**? Enabling people to function in a free market is not the same as raising their wages forcefully so they can no longer afford to stay in business. In your overlong reply, you miss the point entirely.

&gt; because of knee jerk emotional reactions to what I can only imagine must be their safe words they use in bed.

Fuck off with your ad hominem bullshit.

&gt; Every free trade agreement kills low wage, low skill jobs in the U.S. and sends it overseas.

Free trade is not the same thing as introducing regulations that force people to stop working (i.e., wage rises that they didn't ask for that'll put them out of work). If someone can compete with the world at large, they are free to do so in a free trade system. We are seeing jobs that *could* survive disappear because you've intervened to *make* them unprofitable, rather than let them become unprofitable from the workings of the market. 

This is a bad analogy and you should feel bad.

Jobs that you'd prefer not to exist because ""they shouldn't exist"".

&gt; First you state they do it because they want to then succeed it with they don't have qualification to do anything else based on lack of qualification.

You can do both at the same time. There's no contradiction between doing a job that you want to and having to settle for what your skills enable you to do.

How are you going to move people from minimum wage work to more skilled work, exactly? How do you produce the jobs that these people were unable to bring themselves into?

If size was the guarantor of economic success then Indonesia would be richer than Singapore and the EU would be richer than Switzerland.

I mean, Europe became the most powerful and wealthy continent in the world for the last 500 years largely as a result of competition between European states while China was left behind as they remained isolated and increasingly backward.

To elaborate, America was formulated by British settlers, it's culture at the time was undeniably Anglo-Saxon, and so were it's people. Not too long after the independence of America, the Naturalization Act of 1790 was passed, which allowed US citizenship to be granted to immigrants who were ""were free white persons of good character."" This was the first law that addressed the granting of national citizenship in the US.

Basically, I believe that early US culture was Anglo-Saxon in nature, and while it was influenced to a degree by the European immigrants who become citizens, you have to also keep in mind immigrants actually integrated with society then. European immigrants adapted some of their culture to fit in to mainstream American society. So now we get awesome food like pizza, it's a win-win ;) But in seriousness, I believe it was this cultural and ethnic background that characterized early America, and that European Americans therefore do have a cultural legacy and a nation, just one in distress and under occupation.

**Juncker demands secret service for Europe**



The president of the European Commission has demanded his own secret service to counter spies from the blocâs national governments after it emerged that German secret agents helped America to spy on Brussels.

Jean-Claude Junckerâs comments followed claims that Germanyâs foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), spied on EU officials, the French foreign ministry and the ÃlysÃ©e Palace.

Intelligence, described as âpolitical espionageâ directed at âhigh-ranking officialsâ, was then passed on to Americaâs National Security Agency (NSA), according to reports that appeared in Germanyâs daily SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung yesterday.

In response to the latest in a long line of revelations about American spying on European politicians, Mr Juncker revealed that a âcollegeâ meeting of the EU executive of 28 commissioners had discussed setting up its own spy agency.

âAt a college meeting, I said that the European Commission should have a secret service, because the agents are here,â he said. âI do not know if German agents are active here. This will have to be sorted out by the Germans, including parliamentary authorities, and we will see.â

According to the German reports, in 2008 and 2010 Angela Merkel, the chancellor, turned a blind eye to âabuseâ of BNDâs wiretapping post in Bad Aibling, southeast of Munich, for spying on âEuropean partnersâ and defence companies in return for US counterterrorism intelligence.

France has played down the allegations. âThe Franco-German relationship is indestructible. Even infidelities can be forgiven,â a diplomat told Le Figaro newspaper. âBut rules must be in place.â

Germany, France and the EU reacted angrily in 2013 when Edward Snowden, the American intelligence defector, revealed NSA spying on a massive scale across Europe, including joint espionage operations with GCHQ in Britain.

âSpying on friends is just not on,â Mrs Merkel said in 2013, after outrage over American bugging of her mobile telephone conversations.

Last July Germany expelled a CIA official based at the US embassy for recruiting Germans to spy for the NSA.

A spokesman for the commission said that Mr Junckerâs idea for an EU spy service had not been followed through but he assured âall potential enemies, we are on the ballâ. The spokesman added: âEvidently the European Commission does not, and will not, have a secret service.â

The commissionâs security department has regularly warned officials of growing political and industrial espionage being directed at sensitive or confidential information. In 2009 the commissionâs civil servants were warned to beware of spies in the guise of a âpretty trainee with long legs and the blonde hairâ.

Mr Juncker was forced to resign as Luxembourgâs prime minister in 2013 after revelations of illegal phone-taps by the grand duchyâs own secret service. âIâm a sort of specialist of secret services,â he said yesterday. âI know by personal experience that they are very difficult to keep under under control.â

Our financial records are pretty much out in the open and everyone knows how much debt we have and we have quite a lot (approaching almost 1 billion TL). There are quite a lot of problems with short-term cashflow and we are having trouble paying wages of our players. The stadiums in Turkey were the emptiest they have been for decades as a result of a newly introduced broken e-ticket system and it hit the clubs hard. Most teams played to an empty stadium, and BeÅiktaÅ played without a home venue because their new stadium is still under construction. We used to be in a similar situation to BeÅiktaÅ, but our new stadium was completed 5 years ago and it helped greatly. FenerbahÃ§e was the first team to expand their stadium so with more income along the years they used to be the healthiest club, whereas Galatasaray and BeÅiktaÅ were battling with financial troubles. FenerbahÃ§e also built a Basketball Arena, a new training ground in Anatolia for summer camps, and has the best infrastructure in Turkey with stores selling merchandise. 

Getting banned from Europe hit FenerbahÃ§e hard though, but no one knows to which extent because their books are not revealed. A lot of teams are struggling financially, most are playing without a shirt sponsor (including FenerbahÃ§e) and pretty much the only thing keeping it together for Turkish teams is government's involvement, sponsoring competitions etc. 

Turkish media also can't suck FenerbahÃ§e's dick enough, so when Galatasaray fails to pay player wages on time you will read news about how shit of a financial situation we are in, players are running away and we are about to get handed to administration. Same thing happens to FenerbahÃ§e, Diego reveals he hasn't been getting paid for months, but instead of how FenerbahÃ§e failed to pay their players with their apparently ""amazing"" finances goes without question and Diego gets crucified instead. Since FenerbahÃ§e is governed by an iron fist by a convicted match-fixer, no one knows what the books actually look like there, whereas ours are almost all in the open. 

The silver lining for us is, contrary to rest of the clubs Galatasaray has a lot of valuable assets, notably an island in the middle of Bosphorus, a large area of land near the third bridge built in Istanbul, a land where old stadium used to be located that could bring in millions, training grounds in the middle of one of the most expensive districts of Istanbul, but these assets are currently used to secure more loans and the money we make each year goes to paying off loans instead of reinvestment. We just reelected a new administration past week and hopefully this championship can provide some basis for a redevelopment now. 

**TL,DR;** FenerbahÃ§e built their stadium first so they used to have better financial footing, then we completed ours and increased our revenues, BeÅiktaÅ is currently building theirs and are deep in loans, FenerbahÃ§e got banned from Europe which hit them hard and now all of them are fucked if the government stops sponsoring the league.

&gt;You seem to be under the impression that the UK leaving the EU means that we would have absolutely no influence whatsoever, which is obviously not true. If it makes political sense for us to maintain the same financial regulations as the EU then we can do so, just as we can do so will all the other EU regulations.

Don't just spout some platitude about sovereignty, or being able to follow European regulation if we want to. Explain to me how we would retain the free flow of capital, access to European clearing houses without an intermediary, and unitary enforcement of cross border contracts, and you might go a small way to convincing me that your attack on me here is anything other than responding to a dog whistle of me being pro-EU with some formulaic platitudes.

A good friend of mine bought a Point 65 XP18 a number of years ago. The design was apparently by some Porche engineer.
 If I remember correctly the manufacturing was changed to China from somewhere in Europe.

 A few things over the years that I have picked up while paddling with and in that kayak.

A very fast kayak. The bow is like a razor blade.

Can stow a huge amount of gear quite comfortably. 

Struggles when stowing gear on top, which might not be an issue for some but we like to strap on Coolers and chairs fishing gear and guitar etc. So not great top heavy.

 Easy to get in and out of from shore. Not sure about while one is  mid-water.

 Not sure about pre-Chinese manufacture but it is crappy fibreglass with hulls so thin that sunlight barely has a problem passing through.

 A few small leaks between hulls.

 Rudder was demountable and has a horizontal skeg.

 Rudder cables are thin fibre rather than stainless steel.

 The firbreglass body is very, very fragile. Takes very little to put a dent in it. (Those star/web shaped dings)
 
 The paintwork rubs off with no effort.
 
Has a compass slot in front of cockpit.

Not that great in choppy water.

Not great in windy conditions.

Really, really fast on flat water.

This was the cheaper fibre-glass version. It also came in a carbon composite material but after the shoddy construction in fibre-glass, I would not personally hold too much faith in a carbon/composite build from this company.

Honestly, without forgiven and the exact perfect meta that was around last spilt, SK would've been bottom 4 without a doubt.

Also, consifer the fact, that Forgiven is so influential on the teams he is on, all the bans go onto him, because he play with average-to-bad players at all roles and still hard carries them. In retrospect, when was the last time you saw anyone ban a champion against rekkles? That is because its very easy to be a cleanup ADC, especially when all other players on your team are superstars.

Those ""terrorists"" are considered national heroes by many for casting off the yoke of imperial oppression. They even have a statue of Gavrilo Princip, the man who killed the Archduke and his pregnant wife.

&gt;**In Istocno Sarajevo, Gavrilo Princip is still lauded by many as a national hero who fought against Austrian oppression.** Milorad Dodik, the republic's strongman prime minister, is expected to open a new park and name it after the assassin. In the Communist Yugoslav era, Princip was regarded as a revolutionary hero who fought for the freedom of all southern Slavs, but now Bosnia is independent it is largely Serbs who cling to this view.

...

The Eurogroup comes in and asks for reform packages and they come with ideologies when what they need to have are pages upon pages of projected cash flows that various concrete reforms will bring.

Everyone seems to miss the point about these sorts of projections, it's not about being exactly right, it's about knowing how to steer the ship when things aren't following the course you set. (e.g. revenues lower than projected means optional spending needs to be postponed....but it all needs to be planned well in advance)

They come with plans that are basically political stump speeches of ""we will reform the tax system"" when the lenders follow that up with ""Great! What are the projected cash flows for that sort of reform and how exactly will it affect the Greek current accounts?""

Whilst I tend to prefer Ronaldo globally, there's no denying that Messi is the better player in big games. 

If you want to compare their statistics against other teams that are supposedly seen as very good, then you have to consider Barcelona and Real Madrid quality as well. This means that you shouldn't probably look at Ronaldo performance versus Basel or Ludogorets, or Messi against Ajax, APOEL or even PSG (sadly for me). Barcelona and Real, when playing in Europe, encounter opposing sides as strong as they are in very rare occasions. Let's take a look at this year's semis in the CL.

Real - Juve : 2-3 agg. Ronaldo scored the two Madrid goals even though his performance over the two games wasn't very good, especially during the second leg. 

Barca - Bayern : 5-3. Messi scored two as well, yet he completely unblocked the situation in the first game and gave a solid performance in the second leg. 

Now, you shouldn't construct an opinion over only two games, but this example shows that Messi can be wonderful in very big games and decisive, while Ronaldo, despite scoring, won't automatically help his team.

One of the best comparison available for these two players, IMO, is to look at their clasicos performance. [This table shows](http://i.imgur.com/2JTkOsI.png) how the both performed in terms of goals since Ronaldo arrived at Real Madrid. ([Source here](https://www.bsports.com/statsinsights/football/lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-el-clasico-records#.VWw_rFyqiko)). TL;DR : Messi scored 14 and Ronaldo 6. Messi scored three game-winning goals, Ronaldo only one.

Does this mean that Messi is better than Ronaldo ? Maybe. 

The thing is also that Messi and Ronaldo have **very** different styles. The former has an incredible ball control, dribble and pass ability while the latter needs space to outperform his opponents through great athleticism and velocity. Messi has always been cheered for his great ability of keeping the ball in his feet while storming towards the goal or in very dangerous situations. Thus it is very hard to exerce a hard pressure on him, as on his teammates since they enjoy the same ability, to a lesser extent. Especially now that teams have to worry about Neymar and Suarez in the same time, as they were able to ""care less"" about the opposite side of the field in the past. 

In my opinion, Cristiano Ronaldo can be better than Messi if he is at the top of his physical form in a team that will create space for him. Ancelotti used Benzema often to create space for Ronaldo and during Mourinho's tenure, counter-attacks were efficient greatly thanks to CR7 speed, whilst he had a lot of space to play due to the opponent position. 

Now when it comes to Messi, well he seems to be able to unlock games on his own, but his failures with the Argentina national team suggest that maybe Barcelona make him even greater than he really is. During the WC final he didn't show much, hell even during the whole World Cup (and don't give me that ""Best player award"" BS). Although, with Barca Messi was always here during the big games or almost (he scored in the 2009 and 2011 CL Final for instance).

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to point out how different players they are, but also that you shouldn't pay too much attention to certain statistics.

I've seen a lot of answers about the suffrage and religious/social conservative influences on prohibition; but there was also a big xenophobic element to it. The influx of immigrants from Ireland, Poland, Italy, Russia and other parts of eastern Europe was insanely high between 1890 and 1920. These were groups that previously were very small in the US coming over by the millions.

You should do it the euro way : jump from countries to countries by train or plane then rent locally a car for touring around. For large city sightseeing don't bother with a car use the subway/tram/bus/taxi/shared bikes/shared cars whatever is available in this particular city.


Anyway if someone (like a french friend) can help you with the buying and carte grise and insurance  LeBonCoin.fr is the french craiglist. Cheapest cars are there. FYI better cars can be found at LaCentrake website but it's not your point.
According to the law the buyer must have a mechanical inspection done before, the ""contrÃ´le technique"".
For the cheapest cars like one thousand euros or less the owner frequently don't bother doing it because it take time (like one or 2 hours) and money (like 60 euros I'm not sure) and exposes the flaws that you have to repair. So for clunkers they expect you to do the CT yourself and fix whatever has to be fixed. Basically they don't want to be obliged to do the repair before selling they want to get rif of it no questions asked. It's not the law and it's a nuisance

Like I said elsewhere, the cultures that have arisen around football in different countries,  different parts of countries, or even specific clubs varies a great deal. In Brazil what Neymar did is completely normal, even given the game situation, but in Spain and parts of Europe it is not considered good sportsmanship to try a fancy flick like that in a match that is pretty much decided and that's why Atleti and Athletic defenders got angry at him. This is not to say that the way they reacted wasn't pathetic (I'm particularly disappointed in Iarola's reaction after what was the last match of his career), but I can understand why they were angry. How people in other countries feel about the situation is really beside the point, Neymar is playing in La Liga and will be held accountable to the social mores of this footballing culture.

At some point Neymar has to understand that he's playing in Spain and that if he's going to do that kind of thing the referee *will not* protect him from retaliation, because the referees are put off by it as well (even his teammates are a bit slow to defend him in those situations). In other words, while it's good that he has big balls and refuses to be cowed by violent defenders, he should just be smart and pick and choose the right time to do such tricks.

The Germans routinely rotated units out of the eastern front to rest, refit, accept new equipment (and train in new tactics and learn to use new Equipment) and new recruits and other reinforcements and in many cases be rebuilt as units after devastating casualties.

The 6. Panzer-division, for example, partook in Operation Barbarossa and the drive on Moscow in the winter. In May 1942 it was withdrawn to France to be rebuilt after suffering high casualties and returned to the eastern front in time to take part in the attempt to relieve Stalingrad.

That said, not all units ended up in western Europe. Many were sent to rear areas in the Soviet Union to do anti-partisan and occupation duties and be placed in reserve while they rested and refitted. In fact, most of the German losses in armour at Kursk happened during the Soviet counter-offensive, which over-ran the field repair shops where much of the German armour was in for service and repairs after the battle and many weakened German formations ended up in the way of the Soviet offensive.

In western Europe, the German Soldiers could enjoy good infrastructure, reliable mail communication with their friends and relatives back home, secure leave for home and relative low-risk occupational duties, as the resistance mostly smuggled out downed allied air men and expanded their organisation to spring into action once the allied invasion happened. The Germans had also set the exchange rate of the reichsmark to about three times as high to the French franc as it had been in 1930 (well after the reichsmark had recovered from the hyperinflation), which meant that a German soldier in western Europe could buy a lot of things - including expensive luxuries - on his otherwise meagre soldier's pay.

A soldier in garrison or occupational duties (note that the Heer did not man internment camps, only POW camps) would have access to three meals a day (which could be hard to get for a soldier on the frontline every day), sleep in requisitioned houses or barracks rather than tents, ahev regular access to mail, hygiene facilities and uniform washing, including lice extermination. Brothels were common and how the local military authorities handled them differed from accepted (including military medical personell checking for STDs regularly and 'clearing' prostitutes) to outright banned (but still existing).

Soldiers in occupation or garrison duty would often work on field fortifications, help haul supplies, build barracks and other facilities, help clear or repair destroyed infrastructure as well as working on training and equipment maintenance.

Patrols, suffering the occassional air raid, partisan raid, resistance attack, long range enemy patrol, hunting partisans, war crimes (such as shooting civilians as reprisals for partisan attacks), foraging (ie organised plundering of the countryside) and handling prisoners could also happen.

Bottom line is that it varied a lot depending on wether the German Soldier was stationed in western Europe or not, wether or not his unit was in reserve or on occupational duty, if his unit occupied a country where the Germans behaved decently (western Europe, Denmark, Norway, the Baltic states and Bohemia mostly) or commited lots of war crimes (Greece, Poland, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union).",0,AskHistorians,False,1433164189,29,1436633792,,29,False,

It was a wee bit laggy, although that may have been because of the location difference? Im assuming you are from Europe. 

Well, you were quite unlucky to lose right at the end. It was a combination of bad defending and a good run from Walcott. I thought it was pretty odd as you defended quite well for about 80 mins and then switched off for the last 10mins and was punished brutally. 

Attacking wise... you were pretty strong. Some of your through balls and runs cut through my defence. Although I did expect you to test De Gea much more than you managed to do. Some of the runs were pretty typical stuff id expect from D1 players. Maybe try switching it up a bit? Throw in a few skill moves and you'd probably be a pretty hard player to defend against. 

Defending wise. You did really good for the first 80mins! I hate playing against TOTY David Luiz as he really pressures attackers and gives them no space to work around. That being said, it can be a bad thing too, as he is often out of position. Im not a fan of the Schweinstiger + Luiz combo. I personally dont think Schweini does a good job at CDM, especially when your CB has such aggressive Workrates. You probably need someone with M/L Attacking workrates in the CDM position right above Luiz.

What you really needed to stop me doing was the switches from Hazard to Sanchez. These were just short passes that stretched your team wide. 

Last goal was typical fifa stuff. You did lose the ball sloppily but there isnt much you can do about the run. Defenders in fifa react so sloppily its just hard to defend against.

The fact people rejected AV does not mean there's no need for reform. The majority could actually reject reform and there'd still be a mandate on the basis that the majority cannot be allowed to suppress a minority voice in a democratic society, 7.5 million people voted for the Liberal Democrats, Green Party, and UKIP. Yet they received 10 MPs between them. That's a lot of people with no real voice, and there needs to be a real discussion on that by people that don't equate their political opponents to alcoholics.

Single-payer systems *tend* to be cheaper then multi-payer systems as they can tweak the availability of services and have a much finer grain control over how people consume healthcare, this allows for planned shortages which reduce the cost of providing care but in a trade off with accessibility. Its certainly not a universal though, Norway doesn't reduce service availability like the other Nordic countries and has one of the highest cost health systems in Europe as a result (either fourth or second in the world depending on the data one uses).

Beyond planned shortages there is no particular cost advantage to single-payer over multi-payer systems, they don't axiomatically incur lower administrative costs; some single-payer countries do well (Canada) while others do not (UK). The US administrative premium is due to the absence of an all-payer billing system in all but one state, switching to an all-payer system would reduce costs by between 8% and 11% long term.

Some simple reforms which would go a long way to correcting the US excess costs are;

* Switching to an all-payer billing system. Providers and insurers in each state are required to negotiate a single master contract for that state, all providers and insurers are bound to that schedule.
* This is already occurring with Medicaid and will start occurring with Medicare from 2018 but moving public patients to a state self-insured carrier model corrects a number of problems that the public payments system introduces and prevents inefficient forms of transfer in the delivery system.
* Increase public funding for residency programs and federalize the licensing system so that foreign physicians can practice in the US.

The new republic's citizens will see their tax bills drop - but they'll face worse services.

Oil prices will collapse as the Saudis open the floodgates. Five years of cheap oil will hurt the Saudis - but it will destroy Texas.

""Leviathan"" Thomas Hobbes.

Lac Leman is shiningly blue this morning, shimmering in the early summer sun with the reflection of light and land that is the allure of this beautiful place.  The massif of Mont Blanc is clear in the distance, recumbent like some enormous statue of Abraham Lincoln contemplating the very high, and the very low politics of life. I am back in Switzerland, the country of mountains, and Geneva, the city of peace and the seat of international organisations.  This is a home to me. Indeed, I have spent much of my life in this town over the years having worked with the UN, World Health Organisation, and for a short time with the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.  Switzerland, more precisely Zurich, is also the lair of FIFA, denizen of the dark underworld of elite corruption of which the governing body of world football is master.  The gravy train of gravy trains that seems to run to a precise timetable of patronage, like some dark parody of the superb Swiss railway system that serves it and the rest of this meticulous country. However, FIFA is but an extreme example of an extreme system.  So, why are international organisations so prone to corruption? 

The wrong people in the wrong places: There are many very good people who work for   organisations such as FIFA, brim full of belief in 'the mission' and passionately determined to make the world a better place.  However, too often these good people are out in 'the field' doing the right thing far from the broking of power at which their dark masters excel.  Indeed, at the heights of such organisations one too often finds the politicians and self-serving elite attracted more by the prestige, the status and of course the money in which many international elites are mired than any love for any game.

The wrong people with the wrong beliefs: From my own experience I have seen how so often 'representatives' or 'delegates', or whatever they are called, are the wrong people from the wrong places with the wrong beliefs.  Often the sons and daughters of national elites (Blatter's daughter works for him), invariably the schemers (as Sepp Blatter once admitted himself to be), and inevitably the power-brokers, the strong men (normally men) who have scrambled to the top of the greasy pole and believe that private jets, police escorts, and uber-hotels are but the fruits of conquest.

A culture that promotes wrong-doing: Like all uber-elites the members thereof are very good at convincing themselves that the exchange of gifts, in its many mercurial and pecuniary forms, is not corruption at all but 'mere tokens of respect. They except such largesse not for themselves, you must understand, but on behalf of their 'people'.  It is a culture reinforced and perpetuated by an elite adept at speaking 'of the people', but from a height so far distant they might well be sitting atop Mont Blanc, or is that Mont Mammon? Olympians of deceit and self-deceit reinforced by a 'we are all in this together' culture that reinforces wrong-doing.

A system that fails the majority: Ultimately, it is the 'system' that permits the FIFAs of this world to drive the hubris-horsed, guilt-edged, cash-stuffed coach and horses through propriety.  The simple truth is that there is no real governance of such organisations and thus no real oversight or accountability.  The FIFAs exist in a form of anarchy in which the only 'law' is that of the elite jungle - take what you can, while you can, when you can...in the name of the game/people (delete as appropriate). 

The FIFAs of this world have become Saville Row suited 'players' adept at dribbling around propriety into the open but hidden goal of personal greed.  Audit commissions are set up that do not audit. Ethics committees are set up that are unethical.  'Transparency' is talked of but hidden behind a raft of lawyer-led secrecy, often in the name of 'protecting' commercial and organisational 'rights', when in fact it is merely to keep we the paying peasantry at far distance from the gilded elite and their gilded lifestyles.

Masked in the language of selflessness FIFA this week was super-selfishness at its very worst.  Americans (well done Yanks!) and the Swiss tried this week to provide at least some form of 'good governance' by indicting several of Blatter's lieutenants.  And yet, Blatter, as yet unindicted, was re-elected as FIFA President just two days later demonstrating yet again just how embedded self-interest is at the heart of elite internationaldom. 

Why does such vice continue?  Why is the cash of millions of taxpayers, supporters, customers siphoned off by such a self-serving few?  The reaction of Russia's President Putin was indicative (but by no means exclusive). The US indictments, he said, were sour grapes for losing the 2022 World Cup bid, yet another example of an America that wants to rule the world. THAT, is the real reason that the corrupt elites of internationaldom are able to impose such a burden of false entitlement, such a heavy tax of hubris, on the rest of us.  The states and the respective institutions in those states responsible for imposing some level off propriety on the elite are more concerned with fighting each other than ensuring proper behaviour.  Oversight and accountability exists there none.

There are many Blatters at rarified levels of internationaldom, consummate in the dark arts of survival politics, never 'responsible' for the corruption rampant around them, but at the very least utterly complicit by association and maintained in power by an ironclad system of patronage and partiality.  And, there will always be Blatters as long as there is no power, no Leviathan, to impose order above the state of nature in which the Blatters and their cohorts prosper.

The very first football club in the world Sheffield F.C. was formed in my home town in England in 1857.  It was a noble idea that led in time to what became called 'the beautiful game'. It is a game that no longer has anything to do with FIFA.  FIFA instead has mastered the oldest and ugliest game of all - vice, hubris and deceit.  It is time for Europeans and North Americans and all men and women of goodwill to play a different game and simply walk away from FIFA.""

Navy Wise:

You lose out on navy a bit, sacrificing 25% naval force limit, -20% galley cost, -25% naval maintenance and +50% galley combat ability and only gaining-15% galley cost and +20% galley combat ability.

Italy gains 15% Infantry combat ability (one of the best modifiers in the game, they're practically Prussia) and 33% more manpower.

Firstly, most of the people identified as such when they took the UK further into the EU, were doing it because it was an easy way to get change they wanted to see.  

EG, Tony Blair,  with the Maastricht treaty social chapters, Human Rights Act, etc

Going back earlier, in the 1980s one of the basic principles in favour of joining the ERM at a high exchange rate was that it put pressure on the private sector to curb price inflation (inflation and exchange rates are mutually interlinked, if you lock the exchange rate you can't devalue through inflation and have to control inflation instead)

 would you call Mrs.Thatcher a Euro-federalist?

Defining characteristics that make these people non-federalist are their love of power, their desire to keep passing laws locally and telling people what to do. True federalists would realise their position as MPs is untenable unless they resolve not to use their powers

Then.. there are the minority, the true federalists. People like me. I'm 37 years old. I've never been on a battlefield defending the sanctity of my nation's borders against invading armies. I've never needed to. Nor has my father.. although my grandparents fought.

There was a major war in Western Europe more or less every 40 years from the era of the Roman Republic to 1945. One of the reasons I attribute to it having stopped is that when European nations have true freedom of action and policy, they invariably end up misaligned with their neighbouring states to such an extent that only war can resolve the differences.  The Treaty of Rome stopped that, dead

And millions live today who otherwise might not.  The EU is often ridiculous, obstructive, inefficient, corrupt, silly, contradictory. And I am constantly glad of it

The war began as a power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire and eventually dragged every major European power into the conflict on one side or the other. The devastation of the war made European leaders keen to avoid another one like it occurring.

I'm generalizing a bit, but the agreements established the ""ground rules"" for the way countries interact:

* *They respect each other's territorial integrity* - A country has sovereignty over its own territory and can expect other nations to respect its claims.

* *They don't intervene in each other's affairs* - Each country has the right to manage its own internal issues as they see fit and can expect other countries not to meddle

* *They are all equals* - Each country, regardless of size, power, or wealth, enjoys the protections of the previous two principles and any other agreements.

Obviously, the three principles have been violated hundreds, maybe thousands of times since 1648, but the difference is that those instances were exceptions to the rule, as opposed to being business as usual pre-Westphalia. Today, countries are expected to follow them, and when they don't, they can expect a backlash from the international community.",0,explainlikeimfive,False,1433183138,16,1436642376,,16,1433188715,

If you don't have one, get a drivers license ASAP as long as you are still in the USA. It is relatively easy and cheap to convert your US drivers license to a German one within the first six months of staying here and I strongly recommend doing that. If you don't, you'll have to take lessons in Germany, which will be quite expensive. 

&gt;Car?

If you are working with Mercedes, you are expected to drive one. Workers get discounted models straight from the factory, so many sell cars that are about 1-3 years old and get a new one. For this reason there is a large supply of used Mercedes in the area. It should be fairly easy to pick up a ten year old Mercedes in good condition. Failing that, a used VW Golf or similar small car is the way to go. 

&gt;How is public transportation in the more rural areas of the country?

The Mercedes-Benz factory in Sindelfingen is well-covered by public transport. A car is nice to have, but you can get around without one just fine. 

&gt;What is a livable salary? 

Depends upon your idea of liveable and whether it is brutto (before taxes and social security payments) or netto (after taxes and social security payments). Rent will be around 400 EUR, food and body hygiene around 200 EUR per month. So as a rule of thumb you need around 700-800 EUR netto to live and have a little bit of fun, this translates to roughly 1000 EUR per month brutto. 

&gt;How easy will it be to explore other parts of Europe?

Depends how much you get paid. Travelling in Europe is very expensive, it is very easy to blow 3000 EUR on a four week trip even if you stay at hostels and eat food from the supermarket. Plus you are there for training. You will be very restricted regarding the days you can take off and you need to study when you are not working, which will be on the weekends. 

Don't expect to get much travelling in apart from maybe two weeks a year, for which you'll need to save up every cent.

&gt;It also requires the judiciary (including tribunals) to take account of any decisions, judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, and to interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. However, if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the Convention, the judges.. .. issue a declaration of incompatibility.

So, under the current system the British judiciary can place an obligation (if a somewhat ineffectual one) on parliament to change the law. Under the terms of the convention, an international obligation can be placed on the UK state as a whole (not parliament) to change the law. Effectively I can't see it making much difference other than removing these powers from the British courts, or at least altering them, whilst freeing them from an obligation to always 'interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights' - however, to the best of my knowledge, it would not prohibit them from doing so and they would probably continue to do so. **So basically the purpose of this** is to remove the incorporation of the ECHR into the actual legal system and reduce it to an international obligation upon the state once again.

EDIT: edited to make clear it would probably not remove the power of the British courts to declare a declaration of incompatibility altogether.

EDIT 2: Added a bit more stuff. And to be even more clear, because the purpose of the HRA is to incorporate the ECHR and the decisions of the ECtHR into national law, and the purpose of the new bill would be to establish the British courts as supreme on the subject of human rights, the concept of a 'declaration of incompatibility' would necessarily have to be changed, but I imagine a new function would be given to courts so they are able to place an obligation upon parliament.

Ya but why not license an arm core and design a custom SOC from that. It would of been competitive and put Russia on parity with other countries. Plus they could of bought older FAB tech from China and had a facility that could compete in the future. Also your country is notorious for exporting geniuses. It why we have laser weapons and Russia doesn't. The science for solid state lasers was developed in the USSR but the people who discovered it moved to the US to capitalize on it. We import the best people from every country we can. Its kind of our MO.

I never said their was anything wrong with having a national budget based on exports. I just pointed out that if the goal of Russia was to become a self sufficient country they cant rely on foreign money to fund the country. Also what western nations are on the verge of collapse? The EU is in a recession but still has an economy that dwarfs Russias. And the US might have lots of national debt but we also print the damn money for most the world. Not to mention the massive amounts of private wealth in the country. If we taxed the accumulated wealth of our top 1 percent of our nation at 10 percent for one year there would be no national debt and a excess to fund the country for five years. Granted that would only ever happen in the worst case scenario which seems a long way off. The US is still the world largest economy even if it no longer has the most purchasing power. The economy is also still growing and the US dollar is growing in value every day. So the west is pretty OK economically. 

I didn't compare Russia to North Korea. I just gave North Korea as an example of a country that strives for absolute sovereignty in a world that it doesn't work in. Russia has not gone down that route and I don't expect it would. But if they did they would fail just like North Korea. We already know this because well the USSR tried and failed achieve this goal already.

Also competition from Russia in technology what a joke. Maybe when yall are competing with China we will be concerned. I assure you no one is worried about Russia entering the semi conductor industry. Especially when all they can make is some crap for national pride. Russia is ranked the lowest among the G20 as far as technological adoption is concerned. And is in the triple digits when compared to the world. By the time yall get the latest tech its old. 

While your STEM education is rated high your higher level education is rated low. Russia only has one school in the top 100 list of universities in the world as rated by China. In fact their is only two Russian schools in the entirety of the top 500 list. What good is solid STEM education when your Universities are mediocre at best?

Supply doesn't have to drop for prices to go up, all that has to happen is demand has to go up to meet supply.

I'm nearly 100 hours into TW3 now. I saw what others have pointed out, that there's no non-whites in the game. Yet it absolutely did not bother me in the slightest. 

This was some fantasy land obviously crafted based on European mythology. The ONLY thing they have in common in my mythology is that one dragon in TW2, and that dragon didn't even look like a Chinese dragon.

In fact, I'd probably be pretty pissed if they included some Chinese dude in the game. It'd be a very obvious move to pander to us.

First, there's the semantics of whether or not ""being responsible for someone's death"" is the same thing as ""killing someone,"" which I think we're agreeing are two different concepts. 

Next, there's the obvious issue with scale; Mao's Great Leap Forward and subsequent Cultural Revolution were several orders of magnitude more destructive than the U.S.'s ill-fated war in Afghanistan. I think it's safe to say that Bush placed a much higher value on human life than Mao did, even knowing that his decision would result in combat deaths. 

A further distinction can (and I think should be), made between combat deaths and civilian deaths, especially considering that every U.S. soldier in Afghanistan knew the risks when they volunteered. 

Mao, on the other hand, was responsible for the deaths of people on farms hundreds of miles away from Beijing who probably wanted little to do with his reforms. Mao unilaterally decided that their lives were wrong and not worth living. I should also point out that military operations were also carried out with the best intentions of the U.S. in mind (namely: security in a post 9/11 world); I don't think it's the extreme example you're making it out to be. 

The salient difference between the examples you've pointed out and what Mao wrought is that Mao was one person. The buck stops with him; he was solely responsible for them and went to great lengths to ostracize, marginalize, and even kill the people with a differing opinion. Congressional approval and an enraged, deeply insecure public were both necessary to Bush's ability to actually make that decision. With Mao, accountability lay solely with him. 

The causes of the Great Depression were so nebulous that economists, sociologists, and historians are still arguing about how and why it happened. It was more than a few misguided politicians making poor decisions. The overarching view in economics was misguided; there was a cultural component and lack of financial oversight. There was the closing up of countries following WWI, there were even environmental factors that caused the dust bowl. 

Again, there isn't a singular character you can point the finger at and say ""this guy was the problem."" Just the opposite is true with Mao. Does it matter that Mao was far more responsible for far more deaths in China than Hoover, Smoot, and Hawley were in the U.S.? I think so, and I think that the language we use to describe them should reflect that.

I've seen you make the argument that the deaths are more attributable, or partially attributable, to the circumstances following the civil war and the wars with Japan. I think that there's probably some truth to that, but it begs the question of why famines happened over a decade after the wars ended. 

By comparison, there were famines in Europe following the devastation of WWII, but they happened in the immediate aftermath of the war. That they were so delayed in China (or still happening) speaks volume about the ruinous Chinese leadership.

So, if we're working with this version of history, then I'm left questioning why Chinese leadership was so ineffective in rebuilding their country while others managed to (with great support from the U.S., sure, but isn't that still a strategic decision that was made?). Isn't that still gross negligence? Isn't there still culpability in that?

I don't think that ""he caused a lot of pain, but he was well intentioned and not as bad as you think"" quite captures Mao, but I get the impulse. He was as cold and brutal as he was charismatic, and China didn't begin to flourish until the moderates he kept at bay were able to take control following his death. They valued the stability that political continuity provided, so they canonized him as figure head. 

If your point is that Mao didn't go around slapping food out of peasants mouth, then point taken. You're right. He wasn't killing for the sake of killing. Neither was Hitler; Mao knew that China was one way and thought it would be better his way, even if it had to bleed to get there, just like Stalin's USSR. The record is pretty clear that he knew what he was doing, and that doesn't absolve him.

Elamite was from the same general region and is also an isolate.

There are probably others that died out just a little bit too early for us to know them.  Or at least for us to know them well enough to classify them and link them to other languages.

I have studied in Aarhus. But as far as I know, every Danish student have the *right* to have Dansih lectures at the bachelor. So I think it could be problematic to follow the lectures? Most of our books were on English: but I had two books on Danish. One in Calculus and one in Statistics. And I think you have to have both courses. There are international students as well, but I think it is on the master. So I think it could get a little problematic if you can't follow danish lectures. If I would be in your position, I would [contact](http://cs.au.dk/contact/contact/) the Department of Computer Science. Maybe they could answer your questions and tell you if you could make your bachelor on AU? I can't find anything about English lectures on bachelor, just a lot on the master. But contact the university, they should know!

About SU: as far as I know, you may work when [you get SU](http://www.su.dk/English/Sider/eulaw.aspx). But you have to pay more in taxes. You get SU if you are EU citizen. Special laws for EEA members and for Switzerland.  If you have questions about SU, just read on the linked page. Or you could contact SU. You could ask about SU here, but if there are special rules for international students, I don't know if I could answer.

Last but not least: you should find a place to live. And you should try to find a place to live in good time! Take a look [here](http://www.kollegiekontoret.dk/english/home/).

**My advice: look at the links I have given you (especially the first two) and get in contact with the university/SU and so on**.

You could of cause try [another university](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Denmark) than Aarhus University (AU). As someone from ""Julland"", a ""Jyde"", I prefer AU and would never ever study in Copenhagen ;-) ... but I think AU and Copenhagen are the best two unviersities in Denmark: both elite universities. AU is one of the 10 best universities in STEM. So if you study STEM, I think AU is best. If you study business and so on, I think Copenhagen is best. The last good university in Denmark is in AAlborg (AAU). AAU is a newer university, best known for it's group work. They do everything in big groups: even exams. Then there is ""Syddansk University"" - known for it's really low standard to get in. But actually all universities in Denmark are good. AU and Copenhagen have the best reputation and are elite universities.

PS! About work: if you speak German (?) some jobs in Denmark prefer German speaker, because Denmark has a lot of German terrorists. Actually there are a lot of Germans in Aarhus as well: I often here a lot of German when I walk on the floors in AU - but I speak German fluently myself, so it is OK ;-) ...

EDIT:

&gt;Deadly potions and menacing spirits dominate the storyline, but there is no mention of **Jesus** despite the fact that His love was the backbone of wisdom in the Middle Ages.

The story doesn't take place on Earth in the middle ages, why the fuck would there be talk about Jesus, unless you're trying to promote Mormonism.

Most parents will find the thick European accents of the actors confusing. The story, vamped up from the original book, is frustrating for its leaps of logic and implausible romantic scenes.

From what it looks like, this person hasn't violated those terms. If you require business sellers to have a business account, then there needs to be a line drawn on your personal accounts, limiting the amount of transactions per month. A hard limit should be in place, disallowing them from doing more than an acceptable number of transactions. From what you've said, it doesn't really sound like you have a legal basis for your demands. 

A company should always be on the lookout for its customers. This person is one of your customers. You did not set proper expectations for how to use the service. You then antagonized them instead of trying to communicate with them. 

You also need to understand how Magic works. Speculation does happen, whether you like it or not. People will see small ways to make profit off Magic cards. This happens on ebay.

That means that a sunburn may modify a gene that corrects errors in DNA. Next you will get some bad water which have chemicals in it that modify a gene to stop a cell from performing its function. Next you might smoke and another carcinogen changes the gene that regulates cell growth. Next you get an X-ray that modifies a gene that makes you cells metastasize. Next thing you know. Malignant melanoma. The sunburn or dead skin have little to do with cancer. In reality the UV that causes a burn is not the UV that causes cancer.

He could've upheld the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact until he was successful in the west, and then mobilize forces to attack the Soviets, correct?  

He didn't have the capacity to win in the west though. He had no capability of either invading the UK or of destroying it's Empire. That's precisely why he decided to turn east while he still could. Defeating Britain was not going to happen, and the Soviets were getting stronger every year. Crushing them was the only realistic way to get the Brits to sue for peace, and came with the side benefit of fulfilling what he felt his great missions in life: Lebensraum and the destruction of communism and European Jews.

&gt;completely unfeasible both economically and politically

Like I told you before, the SNP's argument depended on complete and utter capitulation of Westminster to the SNP's demands. On one hand we have the post-Scotland UK, still in the top ten world economies, still in control of one of the most important currencies there is and with 800 years of diplomatic ties. On the other hand we have a breakaway state largely based around a slowly dwindling natural resource, no diplomatic ties whatsoever and a minuscule population in comparison. Do you really think Scotland would have been in any position whatsoever to force through a single one of it's demands? Salmond honestly seemed to think he could massively slight England and then squeeze it for all it was worth, utterly delusional. The English electorate would never have allowed a good deal for Scotland, certainly not sharing the pound.

Best case scenario is Westminster goes ""Okay Scotland, here's your share of the assets and the debt we've calculated, take it or leave it"". Worst case for Scotland is Westminster absolutely gutting Scotland of it's assets and vetoing any attempt to join the EU post-secession. Neither of which are close to what the SNP had in mind. The breakup would have been entirely on England's terms and it would have shattered the Scottish economy for years to come.

&gt;evidence of which I'm sure will be forthcoming in your subsequent post...

I expect your claims of Unionist foul play will be fully evidenced as well.

It's true, in any case socialism is extremely expensive and inefficient, if you don't want to be constantly running out of other people's money you need a powerful economy which the SNP don't know the first thing about creating.

The systematic dismantling of independent thought comes as a surprise to you?

Also, when a clever person, with independent thought, decided to test whether the 'word of god' Joseph Smith was hearing would be the same if asked to repeat the first part, Joseph Smith immediately said something totally different.

&gt;The __2nd Parachute Brigade__ was an [airborne forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces) [brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade) formed by the [British Army during the Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_Second_World_War).

&gt;The 2nd Parachute Brigade was the second parachute brigade to be formed by the British Army in 1942; it was initially part of the [1stÂ Airborne Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Airborne_Division) but in 1943, after the invasion of Italy, became an independent formation. As an independent brigade it was variously assigned at different times, and served under the command of the [2nd New Zealand Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_New_Zealand_Division), the [8th Indian Infantry Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Indian_Infantry_Division), and the [1st Airborne Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Airborne_Task_Force).

&gt;Before the end of the Second World War in Europe the brigade saw active service in Italy, the South of France and Greece. At the end of the European war the brigade returned to the United Kingdom and was intended to join the [44th Indian Airborne Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44th_Indian_Airborne_Division) in the Far East, for service against the [Japanese Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Empire), but the war ended before they sailed.

I suspect this is the key to everything that's going on here. The medical arguments are just to back up this emotional issue.

For a long time in the US hospital births could only be afforded by the wealthy and circumcisions did become something of a status symbol. As circumcision is largely practiced by white Americans, and not by hispanics, she may perceive this racial differentiation as an indication of social class. I have two good hispanic friends, one of whom is from Nicaragua, both of whom decided to circumcise their sons. I could not at first for the life of me figure out why they did, then I realized this reason is precisely why. They spend time in social groups with wealthy white women and it no doubt influenced their decisions.

How to deal with your wife is a tricky decision. Here is what I would probably do:
I would tell her that circumcision is simply not on the table for you. You simply do not feel that body modification/mutilation is a valid parenting decision. Then work with her to explain why you feel that way.

I would directly point out that the fact that many white American males are circumcised has led to its perception as a status symbol. Tell her you'll buy him Abercrombie clothes if needs to fit in, heck I'd buy my kid a Mercedes before I'd cut his penis, but you will not modify his body. He can always choose that for himself when he's older.  

One nurse in the hospital I was in pointed out that in her experience it is the most educated people who are choosing *not* to circumcise. First of all, they may be aware of circumcision's history and it's harmfulness. As they are successful they don't feel the need to prove anything in terms of status. Also, the intact movement is coinciding with the breastfeeding, organic baby food, cloth diapering, attachment parenting movement, which includes a lot of wealthy women. Ironically I think my hispanic friends may be trying to ""catch up"" just when the high status groups are starting to opt out.

As a Chilean, your wife will not be grossed out by an intact penis and she knows that intact men live healthy lives. If she insists upon needing medical ""proof"", indicate to her that no foreign medical pediatric association endorses the practice. Here's a list of foreign medical associations' statements on circumcision: http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/

The Royal Dutch Medical Association reports: ""International physicians protest against American Academy of Pediatricsâ policy on infant male circumcision. Circumcision conflicts with childrenâs rights and doctorsâ oath and can have serious long-term consequences, state an international group of 38 physicians from 16 European countries in Pediatrics today.""",0,Intactivists,False,1433204443,3,1436651911,,3,False,

I'm by no means one of his worst detractors, I do think he got a tough ride from the press, but he just never looked statesmanlike. He was nearly ousted by his own party late last year.

He made them (sort of) electable again after years in the wilderness, no mean feat. 

Put it this way, the UK wants EU reform. The chances of the country getting it are slim at best. In a straight comparison between Cameron and Ed I'd much rather have the former negotiating for us than the latter.

First of all, it is not true that the bulk of points lies where you said - Italy had merely two teams in the CL group stage, and only one advancing, this year - yet we scored more than England *ever* did.

The difference between West Ham going out immediately and winning all qualifying matches is exactly one full point for your national coefficient, which is more than your lead on Germany as of this season, to make an example. Making it out of the groups, instead, is not as big a deal as you might think: the five points bonus is offset by the (relatively easy) round of 32 teams get in the EL, provided they got third in the group.

Hellacaust- veterans of the scene. 15 years strong. Black/thrash/death metal. Their first album Dark Age Descending is amazing.

Terratomb- Black/death metal. Been around since the late 90s. Currently inactive, which is a shame. They are great. Rebirth Through Destination is one of my favorite albums. 

Spew- Thrash/punk. Alcohol/party themed. Hilarious and awesome.

North End Metal All Stars- A unique combination of black and power metal. They just played what may be their last show ever on the weekend. With 6 members, they always had a tough time with personal schedules and what not. Probably my favorite band ever. So over the top and entertaining. I hope they play another show some day. 

Hard Charger- New Brunswick crust n roll. They've been touring the world the past few years. Fast and heavy and dirty as hell.

Black Moor- traditional/thrash. Going nearly 10 years now, soon to release their 3rd album. Great live shows. They some times do an impressive Thin Lizzy cover set.

Napalm Raid- crust. The amount of touring they've done in the past few years is incredible. Brazil, Mexico, Europe. They did a massive north american tour hitting every major city in Canada and the US. They rarely play at bars, just underground/DIY venues. 

I love the Halifax scene. Its not a big city, so everyone knows everyone. Things kind of slowed down over the past year, but we still have great shows. Any touring band that gets a decent crowd here knows how crazy Halifax can be.",0,AskReddit,False,1433208776,2,1436653679,,2,False,

This is exactly the kind of thinking the guy was talking about when he said naive. Firstly, the current sovereign debt crisis did not develop due to government overspending over time, it was a private sector crisis that left a huge whole in the economy. The government at the time decided the risk of letting the sector default on its debt was worse than the enormous expense of bailing them out, so regardless of how you feel about it, it was private sector accrued debt, that was passed on to the tax payer - which created the current high debt levels, not long term overspending. 

Secondly, austerity doesn't work. For all the 'common sense' talk cutting public spending has thus far only created more debt, though the deficit has decreased, it was still Â£76 Billion at the budget just prior to the election - so not even close to surplus let alone actually being able to pay off any significant portion the debt. Which, like Steve Keen explained in the video, wouldn't work anyway because long term surplus aren't politically sustainable. So this means that even this 'prudent' method is relying on the economy growing to reduce the debt burden, its not actually going to be 'paying off the debt'.

Which leads to the fact that austerity doesn't lead to economic growth - it intentionally depresses the economy, with the thinking being that being on a firmer financial footing is going to encourage people with money to invest to do so. But this is wishful thinking at best, because its never going to be reflected in the numbers - poor growth and thus an increasing debt-to-gdp ratio, and a culture of saving only encourages people with a lot of money to either save or invest in a country in which profit is more likely (where the economy is growing). 
The only way to offset this would be by increasing exports and running a trade surplus, but considering the manufacturing sector in the UK isn't great, and our main trading partner the European union is also firmly committed to austerity, and thus the pressure is on them to save as well, it is highly unlikely. So growth won't happen, meaning more austerity, to which people will only take so much of before they've had enough and vote for someone else.

There is also a moral argument here, like I said, this isn't a crisis that was 'spent and borrowed' in to, it was private debt, turned into public debt, which we are now asking the poorest to pay for through spending cuts and a refusal to raise taxes on those who can afford it. It is not about spending for the sake of it, its about spending in a way that actively promotes growth rather than passively hoping one day people with money are going to decide to invest with no reason to do so.",0,Scotland,False,1433210767,7,1436654491,,7,1433211103,

Starting from where I currently am (USA, NY), I assume it would take a couple of centuries to cross to Greenland, then Iceland, eventually to Ireland and Northern Europe. So around 700 BC, I'd make way to the Middle East, and travel to Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Persia. I'd keep my head down during Assyrian conquests and fall, take in the gardens of Babylon (perhaps a bit dated, but hopefully still magnificent). 

After visiting Crete, I'd take up residence in Athens for a couple of centuries. Field trips to Solomon's Jerusalem, Rome's ""founding"", and maybe a sabbatical to China's warring states would be nice.

Travel would be a pain, but setting myself up as a merchant (Phoenician/Persian/Greek/etc.) would allow for multi year journeys around India and Asia. Perhaps I would get stabbed a few times along the way, but it would be worth it. 

Eventually I could settle in Rome, or perhaps China, for a few centuries amassing a fortune on either import/export, my knowledge of historical occurrences, Russian roulette with swords (I'm immortal after all), or wacky inventions. 

Then, I'd follow Alexander's exploits. Around year 1, move to Jerusalem for a few decades to see Jesus. Back to Rome to see the later years of Augustus, and hit the good times. Then off to Constantinople for a couple of centuries of stability.

I'd move East back to Persia and maybe China, then north and west, following European development. I'd observe the Viking invasions of England (a hobby of mine) and then back off to the east to ride with the Mongols. 

Perhaps a visit to early Japan, then Siam, back through India, and down to Mali. Move to Italy during the Renaissance and perhaps beat the conquistadors to the New World to see the Aztecs and Incas in their prime.

Back to Europe for the English civil war and the founding of the English colonies. I could be in Boston for the Tea Party, see the colonists chase out the British with Knox's cannons and follow Washington to Yorktown.

To France for the rise of Napoleon (I'd skip the Revolution if possible). I might join Wellington on the peninsula (another hobby). See Japan after it was ""opened"", and back to the USA for Gettysburg. ""Open"" China, explore Africa, and eventually back to NY for the stock markets of the 1920's.

We all have a defined genetic sex, which may or may not match the gendered way out brains develop which together with cultural influences guides our gender performance - the ways in which we indicate our gender to others.

Not everyone has XX or XY cells, so there's a way in which gender can differ from what's most common right at the base of our biology. Some people as they develop are not capable of responding to hormonal cues to become male and so they outwardly remain female. Some people develop an anatomical gender that is somewhere intermediate between male and female. The way the brain develops affects our perception of our own gender and so it's been observed that the brains of transgender individuals and people whose psychological gender identification is congruent with their biological sex have a number of differences. Finally, there is gender performance which is different from culture to culture and time to time. Some cultures have defined roles, clothing and activities for men and women. Others add additional roles reflecting genders that are in between or apart from male and female. Over time, gender roles and the expression of gender identity have changed. It used to be in European societies that hose, high-heeled shoes and long hair indicated a masculine look. The policing of gender roles changes. Androgyny was more acceptable in the popular culture of many places in the 1980s than it is now.

Letâs see what I can tell you that maybe new to you. â¦first, as a little background, I spent 23 years of my life living in Europe. I moved in the US more than twenty years ago. I hold luckily both citizenships, and I can see this conflicts from more than one lensâ¦.

And yes, I am an atheist who despise religious extremists and has little to no patience for religious arguments. However, as I am  hoping to show you, this has more to do with Power, blood and empathy than it has to do with religion per se. 

You mention Charlie Hebdoâ¦on the day the attack occurred, I actually left work, took the day off. Mostly because it was really a shock to me to think of Cabu, [a man I watched as a kid]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNBTCayvqt8) in the 80's drawing cartoons and introducing smurfs shows . While I know he was also a political cartoonist, it is still a shock when your very own [Mr Roger]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers) gets gunned down, and when I am shocked, I like to be alone to reflect (this will come back tomorrow). However, even if Cabu has been gunned down by Islamists, that doesnât mean I would suddenly agree with the LePen, and other French far right noodle heads, or worse American far right shit heads about how to deal with Immigration, and the issues of Islamism. Of note about this, the cover for which the Charlie Hebdo people were gunned down was a declaration against Fundamentalism, but not Islam (the famous [âCâest dur dâetre aimer par des consâ]( http://blogs.rue89.nouvelobs.com/sites/blogs/files/assets/image/2015/01/charlie_hebdo_cabu-dur_aime_par_des_cons-une_0.jpg). In fact, the [first cover of Charlie Hebdo after the attacks]( http://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/805x453_crop/www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2015/02/23/PHOf5595770-bb7e-11e4-95dd-16bbe8d1674f-805x453.jpg) showed them as a small dog, a âRoquetâ (a generic expression a small type of dog that indiscriminately barks and attempts to bite anyone and everyone equally), being pursued by figures of both the left and the right with the title âCâest repartiâ (here it goes again). One thing I can guarantee you, is that someone like Cabu would not have stood for events set as bait in the hope of getting to shoot at people,I am pretty sure those fools would have been given the fool [âbeaufâ]( https://www.google.com/search?q=beauf+cabu&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jx5tVYnaK4LZsAWUtoA4&amp;ved=0CCEQsAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=813)  treatment ( or [here](http://rf.llb.be/image/8f/54b386773570d587e33f8b8f.jpg ) ) and made desperately fun off. rightfulle so, as they deserve nothing but contempt. 

But two other notes on the Charlie Hebdo eventâ¦.

First, [who were these shooters]( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/08/01016-20150108ARTFIG00004-charlie-hebdo-l-itineraire-des-freres-kouachi.php)â¦were they, as you believe, raised to jihadism by closed minded parents, turned from ayoung age by violent imamsâ¦well, lets readâ¦sure, we can see the slow descent into Jihadism, really in the space of 3~5 years. From 2005 till 2010. But, no, no parents, no Imam from their original mosks. Before radicalization, rap music, smoking pot, small delinquency. Rather, the internet, and more importantly, Irak as such as a vacuum, and an injustice hell pit. But no, this is not an outgrowth of their (Algerian) culture, this is not their parents or the Imam the grew with. If anything, it is the ease with which you can convince lost youth to join your cult. Made all the easier when the cult leader can use and twist the image of a war as abject, as absurd, as useless as the American-led invasion of Iraq (and not even mentionning Abu Ghraib). 

Second, some other people in the Charlie Hebdo storyâ¦.such as the policeman, who attempted to defend the Charlie Hebdo offices and received a bullet in the head for it, even after he had been wounded and disarmedâ¦[Ahmed Merabet]( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/01/13/ahmed-merabet-policier-charlie-hebdo-enterrement-bobigny_n_6460624.html) â¦a true Frenchman if you ask me, who showed the true values of the Republic whose uniform he was wearing. Or maybe [Lassana Bathaly]( http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/prise-d-otage-on-sort-et-on-se-sauve-le-temoignage-du-salarie-qui-s-est-enfui-856691.html), the muslim employee of the jewish grocery store ( I am not making this shit up) where the last terrorist holed up. He hid customers in the backrooms, then himself went back to the hostage taker to tell him he was the last one in the store, probalby saving their (jewish) lives in the process.  He was granted French citizenship after that, deservedly so, I may add. 


So tell me again about all muslims, or even the majority on them are those monsters raised by their parents and their imams from youthâ¦.
Here is another [fascinating story]( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/journey-to-jihad) that belies everything you think about how people become Jihadis. A kid not even born to Islam, rather, converted, for a girl at 16â¦then a charistimatic leader, and well, how is that different than Charlie Manson,  or a Jim Jonesâ¦.not so muchâ¦read it through, because it doesnât fit this narrative of bad muslims whose parents and imams âbrainwashâ them into Jihadâ¦not even close. It doesn't fit this delusion about what Islam is that you are feeding. Rather, it shows how cultish, closed and abusive this fundamentalism is, how it really works just like Ashrams do, with mixes of shunning, punishment, but also rewards...

Finally, my favorite restaurants in my current living area in the US are afghans and Persians. They do not stop to pray, they do not treat their customers poorly, they are kind, warm people who make the best lamb on earth. My childâs daycare is run by a kind hearted arab women, she loves the kids, and I thank my good starts everyday of having found her. So that is the face of Islam tooâ¦and it doesnât jive with your amazingly narrow description in most of your posts. Which really makes me suspect of what you write about Muslims in america. 

OK. This was the first half, to show you better fucking donât get to claim the Charlie Hebdo legacy for those competitions. Those people who were gunned down stood firmly against appeals/attempts to violence such as those. They used humour, dangerous humour to make their point, but they had a point, not just an intent to piss off people they didnât like because of their skin color. It also hopefully shows you that the face if Islam is much more diverse than you thought. Both in the Charlie Hebdo attack, but also in who exactly are the fundamentalistâ¦and who are the Muslims in France and in the US. 

Tomorrow Iâll right a second half, attempting to use what I exposed today to more precisely refine my point as to why I find the attitude behind organizing baiting concours distasteful. And why I would recommend all well meaning ethical person should really distance themselves from the organizers and supporters of those events. Not to say outright to give them a giant âFuck Offâ. 

I will also explain why I repeatidly kicked you verbally in the nuts and will attempt to show you it was, at least to some degree, useful, or necessary.

Again not saying nobody will sponsor you, but a lot of them won't even let you continue in the application unless you are cleared to work in UK. 


As far as looking for work goes, usually going to a club's site can pull up a whole list of vacancies for all sorts of positions with the club, whether it be a steward job, assistant coach for an academy team, app developer, etc. 

Assuming you're trying to get into the more hands on sporting side of things(as opposed to office operations stuff), I don't mean to beat you up over anything or say things are impossible, but a lot of the team staff of Premier League clubs tend to be people who have the experience working at higher level clubs in England(and elsewhere) and possess the proper certifications, licenses as well as other general requirements that the jobs call for.

 It's not exactly a situation where a person could easily just go abroad and land a job at a Premier League club, there's people who do have experience and eligibilities who are just happy to get a shot to build a reputation at a Conference North side. 

There's  a lot  of leg work that would need to be had before even getting a realistic shot at it, especially stuff that'd be hard to swing not living abroad such as going through the ranks of licenses to be able to coach the most basic of squads. For instance I just saw a posting for a U17 Women's coaching job at a Premier League club that required a UEFA B License, a bunch of FA certifications and a slew of other stuff; stuff that requires quite a bit of time. 


I'm a fan of the sport as well and yeah it'd awesome getting a dream  job with a Premier League club, but you're kind of a long shot away from realistically getting anything like that right off the bat.

If you got your heart set on working abroad in the sport, I'd highly recommend getting your hands dirty and feet wet stateside where you could probably get a better chance at doing things. Look at Bob Bradley for example with all his experience only became the first American to manage a club in a European country's top tier last year when he took over at Norwegian club Staebeck. 

I'd also be open to multiple locations and not be shy to pick up another language if you have your heart really set in the top leagues of the sport.

 [**Neoliberalism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Neoliberalism__  is a term whose usage and definition have changed over time. 

&gt;Since the 1980s it is a term used primarily by scholars and critics in reference to the resurgence of ideas associated with *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* [economic liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism) beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, whose advocates support extensive [economic liberalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalization) policies such as [privatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization), fiscal [austerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity), [deregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation), [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade), and reductions in [government spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending) in order to enhance the role of the [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector) in the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy).          Neoliberalism is famously associated with the economic policies introduced by [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher) in the United Kingdom and [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) in the United States.  The transition of consensus towards neoliberal policies, and the acceptance of neoliberal economic theories in the 1970s is seen by some academics as the root of [financialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization) with the [Financial crisis of 2007â08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) seen as one of the ultimate results.     

&gt;Originally neoliberalism was an [economic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_philosophy) that emerged among European [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) scholars in the 1930s attempting to trace a so-called âThirdâ or âMiddle Wayâ between the conflicting philosophies of [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) and [collectivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism) [central planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning).  The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which were mostly blamed on the [economic policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy) of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term neoliberal tended to refer to theories at variance with the more *laissez-faire* doctrine of classical liberalism and promoted instead a [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy) under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy).

&gt;In the 1960s, usage of the term ""neoliberal"" heavily declined. When the term was reintroduced in the 1980s in connection with [Augusto Pinochetâs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet) [economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Chile_(1973-1990\)#.E2.80.9CNeoliberal.E2.80.9D_reforms_.281973.E2.80.9390.29) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile), the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and *laissez-faire* capitalist set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of economists [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) and [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman).  Once the new meaning of neoliberalism was established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused directly into the English-language study of [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy).  Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing.  The impact of the global 2008-09 crisis has also given rise to new scholarship that critiques neoliberalism and seeks developmental alternatives. 

&gt;


&gt;* ""Neoliberalism represents a set of ideas that caught on from the mid to late 1970s, and are famously associated with the economic policies introduced by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States following their elections in 1979 and 1981. The 'neo' part of neoliberalism indicates that there is something new about it, suggesting that it is an updated version of older ideas about 'liberal economics' which has long argued that markets should be free from intervention by the state. In its simplest version, it reads: markets good, government bad.""

&gt;


&gt;* The term is generally used by those who oppose it. People do not call themselves neoliberal; instead, they tag their enemies with the term.

I honestly ended up returning home with extra yen because I couldn't spend it all, and I did a fair amount of clothing shopping (which was also pretty cheap).

[PerchÃ¨ no](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddito_di_base)? Meglio che darli ai banchieri, in ogni caso.

Non Ã¨ necessario dare soldi pubblici a banchieri e industriali per reiniettarli nell' economia reale - basta volerlo fare.

&gt; perÃ² dando soldi a loro almeno si aumentano le possibilitÃ  che stai finanziando l'economia sana, e non persone o imprese giÃ  destinate al fallimento.

I fatti degli ultimi 5-7 anni dimostrano l' esatto contrario. 

&gt; Le banche stesse faranno il loro lavoro e daranno i soldi a chi puÃ² renderli produttivi e restituirli con gli interessi - invece di dare prestiti a caso.

Ancora una volta, sembra sia successo l' esatto contrario (prestiti non a caso, ovviamente). Non vedo onestamente da dove venga tutta questa fiducia nei confronti delle banche... che piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ volte hanno dimostrato di non meritarsene neanche uno sputo.

&gt; Inoltre, cosa credi che significhi girare i soldi ai votanti? Significa che i soldi tornavano ai greci - gli stessi soldi prestati, imprudentemente quello Ã¨ vero, dalle banche europee al governo greco. 

Per assurdo, se si fossero dati *tutti* i soldi chiesti in prestito direttamente ai votanti, probabilmente la grecia sarebbe in una situazione molto molto diversa ora. Il problema Ã¨ che i soldi prestati sono finiti ad ingrassare il capitale giÃ  cospicuo (e immobile) dei soliti noti.

&gt;  C'erano, e in effetti ci sono ancora, troppi impiegati pubblici e pensionati, pagati troppo. Ecco perchÃ¨ serve l'austeritÃ , che si, normalmente accadrebbe da sola perchÃ¨ i soldi non arrivano dal cielo. Invece Syriza pretendo di NON applicare le riforme ma vuole comunque altri soldi dai suoi creditori. Follia.

Syriza si sta (ahimÃ¨) dimostrando l' ennesimo specchietto per le allodole - quello che avrebbe dovuto fare Ã¨ minacciare l' uscita dall' euro e il default in modo molto piÃ¹ deciso.

Se hai un piccolo debito il problema Ã¨ il tuo, se hai un debito enorme il problema Ã¨ del creditore. Il governo greco lo sa e ci gioca. Dovrebbe essere molto piÃ¹ aggressivo secondo me, ma il vero interesse non Ã¨ quello di distruggere questo meccanismo infame ma quello di farlo durare il piÃ¹ possibile. Staremo a vedere.

&gt; Il suicidio non Ã¨ pretendere che la grecia abbia finalmente i conti in ordine, ma continuare sulla strada dello spreco.

Uhhh. When?

They  didn't have air superiroity after 1940. And the allies gained total air supremacy a few years later.

They *never* had anything resembling naval superiority, let alone the total supremacy required to make a trans atlantic voyage with an invasion force.

&gt; A lot of their resources were held up in the Eastern front. I am talking about a hypothetical timeline, where Hitler doesn't invade Russia, but focuses the efforts to the West.

Point stands. Battle of Britain ocurred a year before Barbarossa. 

And as far as I know, there  weren't alot of German boats tied up in Russia.

&gt;you got to be kidding me. They were just some dudes,

40 million *some dudes*. Who could easily be trained if things started to go even remotely sour in Europe. By the time the Nazis had both designed, built and trained a cross-atlantic invasion fleet (it took the Allies until 1944 to cross a small channel), a good number of those 40 million would have been ready to fight.


Even if for some reason Germany pressed its entire male population into service for this invasion, and even if they didn't sustain *a single casualty* in both taking Europe and invading England, they would still be outnumbered by the draft elligible population (ages 18-45, not all males entirely) by a factor of 2. 

Hell, even if for some reason Germany just managed to put in somewhere unseen with this giant  fleet and America only became privy to this invasion a week in advance, she'd have millions of troops stationed at home ready to put into service. And well, the millions of eager citizens ready to man coastal defenses. And the millions-strong militias. Good luck with that one Wehrmacht.


And that's also attempting to invade a place you have 0 air presence and 0 naval presence in.

&gt;UK would have been capped and their factories taken over.

UK isn't America, Canada etc.

&gt; Once UK was capped,

She wouldn't have been ""capped"" as Germany was never able to approach such a feat.

There is still huge opposition among the political classes to discussing immigration; having championed it for so long it is very hard not to look foolish when changing sides. In the UK the Labour party - having lost their election with Brown at the helm - tried then to portray itself as 'having been against immigration' and looked absolutely ridiculous. In the UK the second most popular party is now a nationally-focussed (UKIP) party which openly claims to put national interests first. This - along with the election of the SNP, another nationally focussed party - represents a complete upheaval in UK politics, it would be similar in the USA to the Democratic party winning ten states and a 15 year old party winning the rest of their share.

In France, Marine Le Pen's NF continues to take huge numbers of votes, despite what some have said here the party is stronger under her than under Jean-Marie who many suspected was starting to flake out; Europe is not ready to elect someone who channels Ben Garrison.

Most other European countries are going a similar way - and of course there was out and out race war ('Ethnic Cleansing') in the Balkans not so many years ago.

Europe is also still a far far _far_ whiter place than any part of the USA, I don't think one European state is more 'black/colored' as a percentage of the population than any USA state.

There are also a lot of problems with hate speech laws - even if what you say doesn't violate them, there are plenty of charity groups that will doggedly follow around 'extremists' reporting every single thing they say on twitter etc to the police. If you're controversial and attract attention you can be in court for 'hate speech' defending yourself multiple times per year.

There is another problem which is similar to that in the USA, while the Republican party voters are strongly against illegal immigration - moreso than Democrats - the Republican party itself is supported by business interests that have no real interest in reducing the availaiblity of illegal labour.

In Europe - which does not have anywhere near the same levels of organic population growth as the USA - this equates to politicians needing immigration to prop up national health programs and state pensions, which of course are predicated on unending pyramidal population growth. Unlike in the USA there is no voter opposition to those schemes - and neither should there be, to be honest, as everyone benefits equally - there's only significant opposition to actual welfare handouts.

So European politicians need to encourage immigration for financial reasons - similar to Australia - but of course have gone about it all wrong. In the UK at least the immigration 'need' is being filled almost entirely by Poles and other Eastern European citizens, however the immigration statistics don't count those at all - European citizens are literally not counted into or out of the country - so the system still sees that 'need' for counted immigrants...",0,CoonTown,False,1433237896,3,1436661930,,3,False,

Now you may say the minimum wage is not the result of the market and that is true. Still plausibly the market limits the extent which the government can increase the minimum wage without creating unemployment. I.e. if you have open door immigration like the UK does from the EU wages will fall and if the government increases the minimum wage unemployment - particularly amongst natives - will rise. Immigrants will take jobs below the minimum wage if those wages are above what they could make back home. If you don't have open door immigration market wages will rise and the government will be able to set a higher minimum wage without creating unemployment.

This is why working class people should oppose open door immigration. People rich enough to be working in jobs where they don't compete with immigrants but who hire unskilled nannies, cleaners and so on support open door immigration because it doesn't affect their wages but does push down the wages of people they pay.

Iti recomand o litier acoperita cu usa rabatabila la intrare, o sa iti usureze viata in baie dimineata cand vei aprecia ca nu calci pe ""graunte"". Singura problema care am intalnit-o a fost dupa cateva zile in care nu am strans rahatul (efectiv am uitat, nu mirosea nimic datorita nisip + litiera acoperita) si am gasit unul din matzi pisandu-se in cada in semn de protesc, nu mai vroia sa intre inauntru ca nu avea pe unde calca :). De atunci am facut program de curatare la 2-3 zile (pentru 2 matzi), pentru o singura pisica e suficient saptamanal.

 [**Foo fighter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo%20fighter): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;The term __foo fighter__ was used by [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) [aircraft pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot) in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) to describe various [UFOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object) or mysterious aerial [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena) seen in the skies over both the [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations) and [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Theater_of_Operations) theaters of operations.

&gt;Though ""foo fighter"" initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the U.S. [415th Night Fighter Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/415th_Night_Fighter_Squadron), the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period.  Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, witnesses often assumed that the foo fighters were secret weapons employed by the enemy.

&gt;The [Robertson Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Panel) explored possible explanations, for instance that they were [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic) phenomena similar to [St. Elmo's fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire), [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals.

Source? 

&gt;letting them drown

The immigrants who come across in boats (especially in Italy) oftentimes know damn well that they're forcing the host country into an ethical dilemma where they either have to turn them back which usually is a death sentence, or accept tens of thousands of immigrants that they can't support and commit a disproportionate amount of crime. This isn't a matter of ""hurrdurr they should all be killed because they're brown people, RACE WAR NOW"", it's of whether or not turning them away to prevent it from happening in the future is a necessary response to curtail the immigration crisis. 

Answering ""yes"" to that question is a right wing response. Saying that expressing that opinion makes you a neo-nazi is like saying that supporting women serving in the military makes you a Stalinist.
