At this point, it seems far fetched that it would come to large scale conflict, but things seem to be lining up that way. China and Russian are large powers that seem to be saying they are ready to challenge the current world order that is completely within the USA's control.

0,False,"&gt; The context is clear, women are subservient to men as the church is subservient to Jesus himself.

As a former rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth atheist and Christian-hater, I can relate to your conclusion. I spent over 20 years believing the same thing. But I was wrong, and I respectfully submit that you are too.

If this were true then we would expect to see examples of women being treated as inferior in the Bible, wouldn't we?. But we don't. Women are mentioned many, many times and each time they are depicted as intelligent as men, if not more so. 

Just off the top of my head:

- Deborah, the second judge of Israel. God didn't appoint her to be a judge over millions of people because she was inferior. Just the opposite
- Miriam, who along with her brothers Moses and Aaron lead millions of Jews out of Egypt to the Promised Land. Again, God doesn't appoint you to such an lofty and responsible position if He looks down on you.
- Lydia, a wealthy independent business woman who was the charter member of the first Christian church on the European continent at Philippi, Greece. You don't become a wealthy business person if you're stupid. Nor are you appointed by God to lead the a fledgling church in a hostile area
- Abigail, whose wisdom and intelligence averted a war between her husband, a king, and King David

I could go on with Sarah, Rebecca, Ruth, Naomi, Esther, Mary (Jesus' mother), Mary Magdalene, Mary (Jesus' friend), Martha and others.

And the women in the Bible who are depicted as inferior to men are:

- ??? 

There are none. 

I hope, for your sake, you will reevaluate your understanding of the Bible's view on women. No where - including these verses - does it say women are inferior to men. No where. Any such thought is a lie from Satan. These verses are all about leadership and mutual submission in various aspects of life such as business and marriage.

The verse prior to this one, Ephesians 5:21, sets up the entire context. Paul is urging his readers to submit to ""each other"" (not just women to men - it's a bilateral submission). The next few verses give multiple examples of doing so in marriage, families, and business. 

In fact, just a few verses later men are told to ""give themselves up for their wives"" which could be interpreted as saying men are subservient to women. (Interesting how no one who claims the Bible is misogynistic ever mentions that verse.) But they're not. No human is subservient to another.

Nor do these verses address any so-called subservience of the church to Jesus. They are addressing humility through serving each other as wife/husband, employer/employee, etc. for the sake of the overall good (the marriage, the business, etc). 

With all due respect, you are twisting the context, and therefore the meaning, of these verses and in the process are doing yourself an eternal disservice. Whether you end up agreeing with me or not is irrelevant to me. What concerns me is you are distancing yourself from the God who intentionally created you, loves you, and has invited you to spend all of eternity with Him. Please don't reject Him based on a faulty interpretation of Scripture. ",0,atheism,False,1433120331,1,1433506859,,1,False,,crrd8z0,t1_crr4svw,t5_2qh2p,,0,,t3_37uage,artistec,t1_crrd8z0

0,False,"Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground, often flavored, as with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other sweet foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BC. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl, a Nahuatl word meaning ""bitter water"". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.

After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, pure chocolate in rough form. Because the cocoa mass is usually liquefied before being molded with or without other ingredients, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Unsweetened baking chocolate (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other fat, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.

Chocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and a vast number of foodstuffs involving chocolate have been created. Chocolate chip cookies have become very common, and very popular, in most parts of Europe and North America. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes have become traditional on certain holidays.

0,False,"You can get Butane, Propane or a mixture of both to form Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). In Europe it isn’t allowed to fuel a stove from the same LPG tank which is used for driving. The reasoning behind this is that you want to extract liquid LPG for driving, but for cooking you need to extract gas from the tank. Apparently it is not possible to construct a safe or suitable tank for both states of matter (with or without certain additives). You can however get a separate gastank or cilinder for LPG which can fuel your appliances in your dwelling (some RV's tend to have these). In the summer you can get LPG with higher butane-ratio and in the winterseason you can fill the gastank (or buy a cilinder) with LPG on a higher propane ratio. This also means that gas that you have tanked/bought in the summer, could not be usable during the winter.
*Most people in Europe tend to use simple Propane because it is well suitable below 0 degrees making it a widely applicable energy resource no matter the circumstances and butane is not (has to be above 0 degrees). The only reason why butane is used sometimes is because its 30% more energy efficient.* To utilize that efficiency you'll need appliances that can convert the higher energy/liter into less fuel consumption. If you have very simple appliances chances are that energy efficiency wise it wont matter much or atleast alot less then 30%. So be sure to check the possibilities your appliances offer and calculate the difference in the gas prices in your area if you are using alot of gas. I bet some stoves can handle both propane and butane, so they grant you a choice to pick a more money/energy efficient fuel.

I dont have much knowledge about bio-ethanol (thats alcohol right?), so someone else should post about that.

---

&gt;The question of the __race of ancient Egyptians__ was raised historically as a product of the [scientific racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism) of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of [racial hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_hierarchy) based on [skin color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color), [facial features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_of_the_human_nose), [hair texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair) and [genetic affiliations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetics). A variety of views circulated about the [racial identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification\)) of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.  These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the [Caucasoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race) and [Negroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid_race) racial categories. Some accounts argued that Egyptian culture emerged from African populations to the south, while others pointed to influences from the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East), and yet others proposed that perhaps some originated from [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe).

0,False,"Here are reasons I have found. I'll break them down into sub categories. 

&gt;Political-economy of the USSR

-Widespread corruption within the Soviet political-economy leading to shortages and a general breakdown in the economy. 

-Attempts at liberal market reforms that were essentially incompatible with a planned economy.

-The era of stagnation left the Soviet Union and East Europe behind their western counterparts after the gains they made from the 40's until the early 70's. [Despite being stagnant the Soviet Economy did technically continue to grow until 1990, just one year before the nation was officially dissolved.](http://imgur.com/MoeiJOY) 

-Gorbachev's attempts at democratizing the USSR only destabilized it more.

-The Soviet War in Afghanistan bankrupted the nation and a lot of men and money was wasted that could have gone to anything from medical research to improving agriculture. 

&gt;The Oligarchs 

-Many people didn't even care about communism anymore, most people weren't even disenfranchised, they just didn't care. 

-Greedy bureaucrats pushing for privatization. 

-Yeltsin's coup. 

&gt;Other

-Ethnic nationalism in the Baltic states and Caucasus region. [Most places in the USSR voted to stay together as a new kind of union but a few smaller republics did not participate and had declared their independence.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_referendum,_1991). However each republic had its nationalists.  

-External pressure, the USA and even some NGO's were involved in funding and assassinating resistance movements in Eastern Europe. 

-The government could have probably called out the military and put down the rioters but Gorbachev felt it was better not to. 

Admittedly the Soviet Union collapsing was a strange event that could have been avoided had Gorbachev decided to focus on reforming and improving socialism along with punishing corruption instead of trying to create a nordic-style social democracy. Had they done this they may have salvaged it. In 1985 when he took power the Soviet Union was one of the most stable nations on Earth, the planned economy was still working, the economy was growing, most services worked, and the USSR was essentially at its peak in international influence. 

My family remembers that between 87/89 social services stopped working with shelves becoming emptier. Riots were more frequent and harder to put down and the system was collapsing. The utilities, stores, infrastructure and medical care which were all behind the West's which had at one time at least been accessible were now becoming scarcer.  By 1990 the Soviet Union only existed on paper and separatists were declaring their independence.

0,False,"&gt;The biggest issue with these bans are that they send the unintentional message that Moscow isn't willing to negotiate

Since when the EU is negociating over Ukraine its John Kery who came to visit Putin and start de-escalate things  it was never the EU or any single European leaders.

Furthermore at the Riga summit this week the EU has showned it was not willing  to negociate:

1) Russia position on Ukraine and want an all total surrender of Russia

2) The harsh words of the President of the European Council ""Donald Tusk"" in this summit have show a complete esclation of words by the EU first

and I will quote 

[*Mr Tusk said that if Russia was ""a bit softer, more charming [...] perhaps it would not have to compensate its shortcomings by destructive aggressive and bullying tactics against its neighbour*](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32824840)

That was 5 days before this whole thing  in an European Summit. It show the EU has never want des-escalation.

&gt;things start to spiral out of control as forces beyond their control (as a result of decisions of officials in the government that aren't communicating well) start to take hold.

That was exactly the mistake of the EU , this is why right now Crimea is russian and Eastern Ukraine is solidly help by Moscow and Kiev is losing. The EU was weak was not able to communicate between them or to push hard for counter sanctions simply the failure is the EU in this case

&gt;The issue has nothing to do with how practical or effective this ban is

Considering how angry they are , my guess is that they were sucessful,

They were completely  take by surprise

For us it was practically an hour long break between serious subjects. 



In highschool you already get specialized classes based on a profile you choose (IT, math, chemistry, biology, etc). The school had a class studying ""religious doctrines"" or something - people learning to become priests and nuns I guess -, but they tended to stay separate from us.

I think that at every stage in human history people are trying to improve their circumstances. Religion happened to be in the right place at the right time (and was supported by the right Roman Emperor) to make its influence felt on Europe. Often what looks good on paper or what works in the short term doesn't work so well in the long term.

Religion simply uses as a model for human behavior a set of extremely ancient practices and assumptions that, over time, have been superseded by better practices and assumptions. Some of those extremely ancient practices and assumptions have persisted because people in power had a vested interest in their persistence. Some persisted because of the nature of the technology that communicated the practices and assumptions across generations, letters carved in stone, allowed them to persist.

We happen to be living in what might be called a watershed era. Technology probably plays a part, but I think that a major role is played by the fact that as more humans live in urban environments new strategies for how to get along with your neighbors had to be developed.

&gt;The __Indo-European languages__ are a [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family) of several hundred related [languages and dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indo-European_languages). There are about 445 Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by *[Ethnologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue)*, with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the [Indo-Iranian branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages) alone.  The Indo-European family includes most major current [languages of South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Asia), [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe), and parts of [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia) and [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia). It was also predominant in ancient [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia) (present-day [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey)), and the ancient [Tarim Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Basin) (present-day [Northwest China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_China)). With written attestations appearing since the [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) in the form of the [Anatolian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_languages) and [Mycenaean Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek), the Indo-European family is significant to the field of [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics) as possessing the second-longest [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history), after the [Afroasiatic family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages).

0,False,"Honestly, I'm saddened by the decline of the Southern Baptist church. It took me a long time to get here though.
I was raised in the church &amp; attended until I was 16 years old. As a teenager I hated the church. It seemed like everything I thought was fun was considered sinful. Many people seemed snobby &amp; hypocritical too. I stopped going to church, fell for the cultural marxist programming, &amp; eventually became a liberal atheist.

I don't know what it is about leftist beliefs that attracts people in my age group, but so many of us embraced a belief system that contributes to the death of our own society. Maybe it is a mix television/internet, control of education, &amp; the appearance of being cool.

Back then, it would have been unthinkable that the church would be in the shape that it is in now. The Southern Baptist church was monolithic. It was the religion for the majority of white Christian southerners. There were several churches in every city &amp; some had members ranging into the thousands. It seemed like it was an eternal institution that could never be defeated. For that reason, I hated it.

At 29 years old I have a much more right wing world view &amp; have embraced the southern culture that I once loathed as teenager. I have renounced liberalism &amp; its religion of equality, am no longer a brave fedora wearing atheist, own as many guns as I can afford, proud to be of European descent &amp; damn proud to be a white southerner. I still can not bring myself to believe in the supernatural but I realize that Christianity played a major part of what made Europe &amp; its people great to being with. The religion unites us &amp; makes us strong against outsiders. I guess I am culturally Christian. It is too bad it took me almost 12 years to realize it.

The Southern Baptist denomination has become another victim of the degeneracy constantly pushed by the left. That southern culture that seemed so strong &amp; monolithic just 15 years ago is now weakened &amp; headed towards oblivion.

0,False,"The previous post offers good coverage. I would add that this is a highly contentious topic in Native American history, and would add Brett Rushforth's *Bonds of Alliance* as required reading for anyone interested in this topic. Rushforth offers a different interpretation of precontact/early historic period Native slavery than that which is usually offered, especially by people like James Brooks. Rushforth disagrees with the idea that kinship incorporations of captives were always genuine, and uses linguistic evidence to show that Algonquians in the Great Lakes region used words for their captives that were derived from root words for domesticated animals. Thus his take on the nature of Native slavery is significantly more gloomy that that offered by other historians who are more prone to see Native slavery as basically ""here is your new family, everything is essentially OK here."" 

Note that all of this refers to Native slavery in the period before the development of European slave markets and their influences, at which point Native slave systems adapted relatively easily to fully commodify humans for market distribution, which is in my opinion additional evidence for Rushforth's hypothesis. I would recommend a comparison of Rushforth and Brooks to get a good idea on the full range of historiographical interpretations of Native slavery in the precontact/early historic period.

It hasn't always been that way, during a very long time, the Japanese felt quite inferior to China. At that specific time however, the prolonged insularity of the japanese people led the Japanese government to strive towards autarchy by conquering as much land as they coud to sustain their people (which they finally had the technology to do it). Obviously in order to gain the support of the people in an easy and ""relatable"" way they had to educate and propagand xenophobic views. About today it is just some remains of that because of insularity and the state protectionism considerably cutting outside influences from Japan  (slowing down the process of people becoming tolerant). I live in France, a country with a great story of destructive nationalism (like any other European country) and it is amazing to witness the ""rascist culture"" evolve to a country of tolerance it is today  (partly due to immigration from ex-colonies and a great focus on openness in education ). It is equally a shame to see that the current political and economic situation with all its hardship is helping far right parties to regain a foothold by protesting the loss of superiority of some is what caused all this.

0,False,"Here's the thing, everything that you said above about circumcision might be accurate, but you can't account for the amount of pleasure loss. 

Keep in mind that circumcision might cut more or less skin off from the Foreskin, and this can have a slew of issues when the baby gets older. 

For men who are cut, they derive pleasure from the heads of their penis, those who are uncut have the extra skin which provides the means of pleasure on the base of the penile glands. 

I always had an issue where I had a loss of sensitivity. I was always able to have sex for 20 or more minutes. This sounds like a cool skill when I was a teenager but it began to affect me and my partners as I got older. I tried not jerking off for weeks and it didn't change. 

I brought it up to my doctor who said that there were no disorders in that regard and it could be because of using it too much. When I explained that it didn't help not to jerk off he suggests it could be related to circumcision but he couldn't make that diagnosis. 

I also have European friends who have said they are unable to understand what the fuss is all about as they claim to have never experienced any infections or issues that are claimed to happen of not circumcised. 

I would post studies but the ones on sensitivity have already been posted here. Unfortunately, there are not enough studies concerning the negative effects of sensitivity loss.

In my continuing quest to make a subreddit for every century AD, I have come to the thirteenth century.

I started this along with the others in October, but it has taken till now to fill up with enough incidents to be worthy of posting here.

The reason it has filled up quicker than the other medieval ones is because 1215 is quite an eventful year, especially in England. 

Period overview: We are at last in the High Middle Ages, a relatively stable period in the history of Europe, a time when the power of the Church is at its height and gothic architecture is its characteristic style. It is also the period of the Crusades, and the Fifth Crusade will begin in 1217. A war against the Cathars in the south of France (the Albigensian crusade) is ongoing. 

The pope is Innocent III, who will this year call the Fourth Lateran Council. 

The king of France is Philip II. The king of England is the weak and ineffective King John, who is at the moment having some  trouble with his barons who are demanding that their rights be codified in written form. The King of Scotland is Alexander II, William the Lion having died in December 1214. The soon-to-be-crowned heir of the Holy Roman Empire is Frederick II. 

Outside Europe, the Jin Dynasty in China is suffering from invasion by Genghis Khan and his Mongol Empire. 

Coming up is more drama with John, his barons, and the Pope, after the signing of the Magna Carta on June 15th.

Certainly advances in metallurgy, writing, textiles and such had been made, but the late Egyptians would not have thought of the technology of the Sumerians as technologically primitive. That's a 3300 year span where things mostly stayed the same.

China also had thousands of years where technology would develop, including things like gunpowder and the printing press, but for a number of reasons it didn't really change the society as a whole. 

We could have had another dark age after the Black Plague. A lot of things could have happened that would have made early Western European technology just another lost high-point of technological advance and left us with another 500-1000 years of archery and small cannons.

0,True,"A. Specifically, Asia is not an interchangeable word with the Orient. Oriental would be more accurately interchange with Asian Pacific Islands or Polynesia. 

B. It is much more difficult for anyone of any race to identify physical characteristics of those outside of that race (this is considered heavily in criminal identifications; I.e. If a person of European Descent identifies another person of European Descent as the perpetrator of a crime, that is depended upon more readily by law enforcement than if a person of European Descent identifies a person of African Descent as the perpetrator of a crime...in theory) SO, it is unlikely that someone from outside that group would be able to correctly identify a person of Polynesian Descent anyways, so the term ""oriental"" would likely be used incorrectly.

C. Culturally sensitive language changes over time which is why many people who might say 'person with African Descent' might cringe when another person says African American...going back far enough, you would feel totally sensitive because the said 'Negro' instead of 'nigger.' Hence, we don't see a lot of push for changing the names of The United Negro College Fund or The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - they were named at times when those terms were either currently culturally sensitive or even ahead of their time. That time for the term 'Oriental' has likely passed.

D. The modern day rule (which actually makes a lot of sense to me because, previously, it either seemed to be a cycle of terminology or a never ending quest to outmode previously correct terms) is to put the person first in one's terminology. For example: one is not autistic, one is a person with autism or a person who has autism. One is not European, one is from Europe. One is not Asian, one is of Asian Descent or one has Asian Ancestry. The idea being here is that what matters actually precedes what matters less, or rather the fact that we are friggin human beings matters more than being gay or straight, black or white or brown, male or female, Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Atheist, able bodied or disabled, rich or poor, smart or dumb, kind or mean, generous or selfish, etc. This system seems like the system that eliminates the cycle of lost-politically-correct-terms which is why I like it...although it does have it's drawbacks such as 'is it acceptable to refer to someone as something that no one seems to find offensive such as 'student'?' and how do we reconcile this kind of person-first language in other languages in which order is different because, while in English, it's Johnny's house, in Spanish, it might be casa de Johnny?

0,False,"John Maynard Keynes said that one of the primary drivers of wealth disparity is monetization of debt which transfers the public's wealth to the elite capitalist class that own the nation's assets:

&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ess_inflation.html

&gt;Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but [also] at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.

&gt;Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become ""profiteers,"" who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.

&gt;Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. 

&gt;In the latter stages of the war all the belligerent governments practiced, from necessity or incompetence, what a Bolshevist might have done from design. Even now, when the war is over, most of them continue out of weakness the same malpractices. But further, the governments of Europe, being many of them at this moment reckless in their methods as well as weak, seek to direct on to a class known as ""profiteers"" the popular indignation against the more obvious consequences of their vicious methods.

&gt;These ""profiteers"" are, broadly speaking, the entrepreneur class of capitalists, that is to say, the active and constructive element in the whole capitalist society, who in a period of rapidly rising prices cannot but get rich quick whether they wish it or desire it or not. If prices are continually rising, every trader who has purchased for stock or owns property and plant inevitably makes profits. By directing hatred against this class, therefore, the European governments are carrying a step further the fatal process which the subtle mind of Lenin had consciously conceived. The profiteers are a consequence and not a cause of rising prices. By combining a popular hatred of the class of entrepreneurs with the blow already given to social security by the violent and arbitrary disturbance of contract and of the established equilibrium of wealth which is the inevitable result of inflation, these governments are fast rendering impossible a continuance of the social and economic order of the 19th century. But they have no plan for replacing it....

&gt;The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to extraordinary lengths. The various belligerent governments, unable or too timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the resources they required, have printed notes for the balance. In Russia and Austria-Hungary this process has reached a point where for the purposes of foreign trade the currency is practically valueless. The Polish mark can be bought for about [three cents] and the Austrian crown for less than [two cents], but they cannot be sold at all. The German mark is worth less than [four cents] on the exchanges....

&gt;But while these currencies enjoy a precarious value abroad, they have never entirely lost, not even in Russia, their purchasing power at home. A sentiment of trust in the legal money of the state is so deeply implanted in the citizens of all countries that they cannot but believe that some day this money must recover a part at least of its former value.... They do not apprehend that the real wealth, which this money might have stood for has been dissipated once and for all. This sentiment is supported by the various legal regulations with which the governments endeavor to control internal prices, and so to preserve some purchasing power for their legal tender....

&gt;The preservation of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of law expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however, the seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of ultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his labors for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to purchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has received for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself, dispose of it to his friends and neighbors as a favor, or relax his efforts in producing it.

&gt;A system of compelling the exchange of commodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes production, but [also] leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter. If, however, a government refrains from regulation and allows matters to take their course, essential commodities soon attain a level of price out of the reach of all but the rich, the worthlessness of the money becomes apparent, and the fraud upon the public can be concealed no longer.

&gt;The effect on foreign trade of price-regulation and profiteer-hunting as cures for inflation is even worse. Whatever may be the case at home, the currency must soon reach its real level abroad, with the result that prices inside and outside the country lose their normal adjustment. The price of imported commodities, when converted at the current rate of exchange, is far in excess of the local price, so that many essential goods will not be imported at all by private agency, and must be provided by the government, which, in re-selling the goods below cost price, plunges thereby a little further into insolvency....

0,False,"Masses of Scotland fans are now planning to boycott Friday's game at Easter Road over revelations that some 1200 workers have died in Qatar building stadiums and infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup.

Anger over the Scotland-Qatar game comes as Fifa, the sports governing body, is embroiled in a series of scandals over alleged corruption and bribery, as well as upsetting Europe and America over the re-election of Fifa's president Sepp Blatter.

Some of Scotland's most prominent human rights activists and leading supporters' organisations have now spoken out against the human rights violations in Qatar, with some comparing the country's record to that of apartheid South Africa.

Amnesty International's Gulf Migrant Rights Researcher Mustafa Qadri said: ""While Qatar's national team takes to the football pitch, over 1.5 million migrant workers continue to risk forced labour and other abuses in the Gulf nation. Many thousands of those facing abuse are working on World Cup-related projects.

""The FA, the football bodies in Northern Ireland [Qatar is playing Northern Ireland today] and Scotland, the sponsors, the players and fans, as well as governments around the world, must send a clear message that they will not tolerate a tournament built on the back of migrant labour abuse.""

Mass opposition to the staging of the World Cup in Qatar has been building. Amnesty International has highlighted the human rights abuses taking place in the country and, earlier this month, a team of BBC journalists was arrested for attempting to film the conditions in which migrant workers are living, provoking widespread condemnation of Qatar.

A spokesperson for Amnesty International said that although they do not support a boycott of the Scotland-Qatar game, the human rights organisation believes it is a chance for the SFA to make a clear statement, speaking out against what is happening in Qatar.

In February of this year, SFA president Campbell Ogilvie travelled to Qatar to meet officials from the country's Football Association where he said he hoped the two organisations could work together in the future.

Saud Abdulaziz Al Mohannadi of the Qatari FA said during the meeting that two countries would have an ""enhanced relationship ... in order to improve the football system in both Qatar and Scotland"".

Over the weekend however, the SFA chief executive Stewart Regan floated the idea of UEFA, the European governing body which voted against Sepp Blatter in FIFA's presidential elections on Friday, boycotting future World Cups if the Swiss were to be re-elected.

Nevertheless, there is no suggestion that the SFA will move to call off Friday's match at Easter Road.

Of Fifa, Regan said: ""There has to be change. There has to be change now. There could, of course, be a rival body. There could be threats of not participating in competitions. There are a number of options.""

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon supported Regan's calls for real change in the way Fifa is run, saying that the latest developments have been ""deeply disturbing"".

She added: ""This week's arrests of senior Fifa officials on charges of corruption are deeply concerning for anyone who cares about football. The World Cup is too important to be tarnished with scandal and suggestions of criminal behaviour. I support the calls of Stewart Regan, chief executive of the Scottish FA, for fundamental and urgent changes to the way Fifa is governed and share his disappointment at the Fifa election result. A change of Fifa leadership appears to me to be crucial to rebuilding its reputation.""

Although, the Scottish Government said last night that they expect all states to comply with human rights law, they did not condemn the decision to hold the Qatar friendly in Edinburgh.

The Sunday Herald asked for interviews with Shona Robison and John Nicolson, who hold the SNP portfolio for sport in Holyrood and Westminster respectively, as well as Humza Yousaf, the party's international development spokesman, but none were available for comment.

Yousaf has already travelled to Qatar to raise concerns around the abuse of human rights in their World Cup preparations and offered to help the country protect human rights throughout the whole process.

Scotland's most prominent human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar is, however, supporting calls for a boycott of the game, and condemned the lack of action from football associations across the world to address the situation in Qatar.

""When you consider how many workers have died trying to build a World Cup stadium for Fifa it is an absolute disgrace,"" Anwar said.

""The problem is that our own football associations have had very little to say about this situation and it is about time they put their heads above the parapet and make a stand.""

The SFA said yesterday that the fixture against Qatar was arranged due to the convenience of them already being in the UK to face Northern Ireland - as well as the need to play a game before facing the Republic of Ireland in a crucial Euro 2016 qualifying match just days later.

However, the outcome of the Qatar match could actually end up jeopardising Scotland's world ranking, and ultimately their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign due to the complex nature of Fifa's seeding system.

Former SFA chief executive Gordon Smith went further than most in football however, when in an interview with the Sunday Herald last night he compared the Scotland-Qatar game to playing South Africa in the 1980's. However, he then went on to say that he understood why the game is going ahead.

Smith said: ""I can understand why there are calls for a boycott. It's a bit like if they had arranged a friendly with South Africa during apartheid . . . there would have been a lot of political ill feeling.

""It is a similar situation now because of what is happening in Qatar and how people are being treated - but Scotland needs a match before they play the Republic of Ireland. So in a footballing sense I can see why it's going ahead, but I understand the political opposition as well.""

Andrew Jenkin, head of fans organisation Supporters Direct, said that action should be taken over the game, as football can be a great tool to bring light to such situations.

""We have seen boycotts of countries which have poor human rights records in the past, such as South Africa during apartheid,"" Jenkin said. ""I don't know if boycotting is the right thing to do but there are many examples of when people have stood up and made sure that sport is the vehicle to express their disdain as to what is going on.

""It's a difficult situation but what's going on in Qatar is not acceptable and football could be the perfect avenue for us to express that in Scotland, we will not stand for it.""

West of Scotland Tartan Army spokesperson Hamish Husband said that he is aware of many fans who have taken the decision to boycott of the game.

""I am aware of many longstanding Scotland fans who decided to boycott the game the minute it was announced,"" Husband said.

""The boycott is happening because of human rights and the slave labour-type treatment of many of the workers building these stadiums. It's not about how Qatar was chosen, that's irrelevant.""",0,Scotland,False,1433139046,16,1433510974,,16,False,,crrlu1k,t3_381hl0,t5_2qkli,,0,Sexy on Stilts,t3_381hl0,brusselss,t1_crrlu1k

That's what you say. They can say just the opposite about America.

&gt; On top of all this is combined the recent phenomenon of racist bigotry widespread across Europe towards Muslim immigrants, the bigoted anti-Muslim racist laws in France against public wearing of Muslim head-coverings, the racist laws in Switzerland against Mosque construction etc.

I wonder if you could be. Do you actually know what effect it has on people's lives? Have you thought to ask?

&gt; FGM, in other words cutting out the clitoris, is opposed by every government on the planet, every medical authority, has no scientific benefits at all

Yes, FGM is not part of our culture. It is not opposed by every government. Otherwise the article would say this was the last government on Earth to oppose the practice. The world medical authorities are all western, so no surprise there. And it's taboo for our researchers to find scientific benefits to FGM. Culture, culture, culture.

&gt; causes massive lifelong suffering by deprivation of enjoyment of sex

Your entire argument is based on science, but you haven't read the science on FGM, have you? The great thing about real science is when the truth surprises you. The studies I've read show that, counter to all intuition, FGM doesn't reduce the rate of female orgasm.

And I'm sure the proponents would argue that it reduces infidelity or whatnot, and they have some sort of evidence as well.

&gt; It is an outlaw practice not permitted by any religion

Come now. Obviously the practitioners aren't going against their own religions.

&gt; done solely to rob girls of the urge to have sex

Yes, that's the reason. Just as the puritanical Americans do to their boys for the exact same reasons. Or perhaps you weren't aware of the history of circumcision in America.

&gt; Male infant circumcision is supported by strong scientific evidence as to both its benefits and lack of any negative side effect on enjoyment of sex

The benefits are mild, that's why Europeans remain unconvinced. The negative side effects are real. You're cutting off the most sensitive part of the penis. Has nobody told you that?

&gt; Can you comprehend any difference between those two ? Or has your euro-centric racism towards minority religious practices completely blinded you to all logic and reasonableness?

My racism towards minority religious practices? Like small African religions practicing FGM? Or perhaps you're calling the various American Jewish and Christian religions minorities. They're a plurality last I checked. I think you're just venting your anger here.

FGM and circumcision are the same thing. They're both awful violations. The Europeans oppose both practices. Some Africans support both practices. At least they're consistent. Most Americans support circumcision and find FGM disgusting, making them both sexist and mutilators.

But the point is when you compare Qatar to South Africa or Brazil the conditions afforded to the workers in both South Africa and Brazil were not analogous to modern day slavery, whereas by all accounts in Qatar it is.  

Now, eight workers died in brazil due to accidents resulting from lax safety protocols, which is utterly unacceptable and to my knowledge no form of justice has ever come about for that. (Please correct me if wrong btw). Now while this is appalling from a cold hearted point of view there is difference between such accidents resulting because of lax safety and the governmental policies of Qatar that not only include major oppression of human rights for overseas migrant workers but also the oppression of women's rights, oppression of freedom of speech, oppression of journalism, and oppression of gay rights.  

Now it's their country, their rules, however, in my opinion, you should not be hosting the largest event on the planet in such a country who enforces such policies that the majority of the world finds morally reprehensible.

I've only ever heard great thing from those who have traveled to Iran, although the US would probably never let it happen, and I don't really know shit about Iranian culture to be fair, they could be just as bad.

And if other middle eastern countries, or any other countries in the world, would have the same issues for hosting a world cup as Qatar I also believe that they have utterly no right to host such a tournament.  

Then again, of course you can say ""Well the West and the developed world has no right to moral superiority on such issues"" and this argument does indeed have some weight to it as the US and every major European nation has an utterly appalling 20th century history of human rights violations, but this is 2015, and in 2015 the vast majority of the world realize that what is happening in Qatar is morally disgusting, *especially* considering the fact the Qatari government is more than wealthy enough to provide basic amenities and assurances of survival to their workers, which is something that makes Qatar stand alone in that sense - They *could* treat their workers well because they're rich as fuck, but, it would seem by all accounts that they simply choose not to.

I'm saying that technical surveillance on a massive scale isn't really something that only a major world power can accomplish.

0,False,"I suppose this is one of those ""define your terms!"" types of arguments- it depends on what you call ""federalist"" and what you call ""secret"". I'm not convinced there are many people, even in the most stridently pro-EU countries, who have the concept of a European superstate fully formed in their mind as a definite end goal, but plenty of people find the idea of further integration a positive one, and plenty of those people wouldn't think of an EU superstate as an inherently scary place to end up (full disclosure- I'm describing my own attitude here). Do they count as ""federalists""? Possibly, depends on your definition. Do they count as ""secret"" because they aren't openly advocating a new superstate? Maybe, but again, all down to definition.

Take Tony Blair as an example. There's no denying he's very pro-EU- he doesn't hide that at all, he wouldn't dream of saying he wasn't. He argued for various forms of further integration during his tenure, such as membership of the single currency and the various new treaties. I don't doubt that he would not find the idea of a European superstate a particularly scary one. But does that mean he's working actively towards one, or is it just that at every point where the choice is ""more integration or less integration"", he's choosing the option that we know he'd find more appealing?

The parallel with eurosceptics is obvious enough. Plenty of people in the mainstream parties are *not* actively campaigning for a Brexit, but are none the less instinctively against further integration and for...er...disintegration.So at each juncture where that choice comes up, they argue for the choice they prefer. They might not have Brexit as a fully formed goal in their mind, but wouldn't be uncomfortable if that's where they ended up.

Then again maybe I'm completely wrong, and Tony Blair et al are secretly this that or the other thing. I'm not in their heads, who knows? My point is, worrying that Tony Blair or Peter Mandelson or Ken Clarke are ""secretly"" very pro-EU doesn't seem like a very useful exercise, when they're the most vocally pro-EU politicians in the UK.

They are simply necessary reference works for understanding Chinese political and military thought. All the sadder that an adequate translation has only been provided for one of them! Sima Qian's masterwork has actually been given two superb translations: the first, penned by Burton Watson in the 1960s, is a literary translation in 3 volumes that includes all of the chapters dealing with Qin (old style: Ch'in, 221-206 BC) and Han (206 BC-220 AD) history; the second, carefully put together by a team led by William Nienhauser, is a heavily annotated scholarly translation that is projected to be nine volumes in total once it has been completed.

The other histories have received less favorable treatment. The last complete translation of the Zuo Zhuan was published in 1872; the Han Shu, Hou Han Shu, and Zizhi Tongjian have received only partial translation, some quite old and usually limited to a chapter or two, while the San Guo Zhi has not been translated at all. 

A new translation of any of these books would be a huge endeavor. The Tongjian clocks in at 20 volumes in modern Chinese, and an English set would be the size of a small library. However, if academia mustered the resources to publish 40 volumes of Al-tarabi's History or the Sanskrit Clay Library's 60 volumes of material, then there is no reason a translation of the classical Chinese histories cannot be organized. 

 China's literary heritage, especially the great classical novels, is a another source of strategic insight, to a degree which is perhaps unique to China. After the close of the Warring States era and the rise of the scholar-bureaucracy in the mid Western Han dynasty (206 BC-9 AD), the social distinction between civil (wen) and martial (wu) grew very sharp and it became less fashionable for the philosophically inclined to discourse on the principles of war. Popular interest in the topic remained, however, and the demand to meet this interest was eventually filled by story-tellers, playwrights, and novelists. The great classical novels are the cream of this crop, hailed with the literary acclaim Westerners give The Illiad, but with the pop-culture presence of The Lord of the Rings.  Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) famously cited examples from the classic Ming Dynasty (1368-1664) adventure novel, Shui Hu Zhuan (old style: Shui-hu Chuan, variously translated as Water Margin, Outlaws of the Marsh, or All Men Are Brothers) when describing his own ideas on strategy and warfare. [9] I am unaware of any attempt to find or list the strategic insights Mao claimed could be found in the novel, though I would not be surprised if a Chinese scholar has taken a stab at it. I have come across Chinese attempts to draw out and categorize the strategic principles found in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (San Guo Yanyi, old style: San Kuo Yen-i) and cannot help but laud the effort. [10] Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the source of many of the recurring idioms and concepts of the Chinese strategic tradition (e.g. kong cheng ji, ""the empty fortress ruse"") and of all texts associated with the tradition it is probably the one that can claim greatest popularity and widest exposure across all sections of Chinese society in contemporary times. These novels portray popular attitudes towards war and strategy with an openness more dignified genres never could, and for this reason alone they are worth serious study. Thus far this study has mostly been done by those with a background in Chinese literature; unsurprisingly they have analyzed the novels in literary, not strategic, terms. [11] 

This brings us to the development of strategic thought in mid to late imperial China (defined here as 960-1912 AD). Though discourses on war were not as popular with the great Neo-confucian thinkers of late imperial times as they were with their ancient predecessors, history did not stop when Neo-confucianism rose ascendant. China still faced external security threats and the specter of internal rebellion. Literati involved in government--and at this time those who governed were almost all literati--still had to face the harsh questions of strategy. Their writings in response to these challenges could be quite voluminous. Strategic theory in late imperial times was most often expressed in what today we might call 'grand strategic' terms, with a focus on the social and economic basis of state power. These are the aspects of power with which mandarins living far from the frontier were most familiar with, and they were safely within the sphere of the 'civil.' There is a temptation to fault these men for their relative neglect of operational art and campaign strategy, but I do not think this should count too much against them. The treatises and memorials they wrote were quite sophisticated (and seem even more so when compared to what was being written by medieval European contemporaries), and had a lasting impact on the course of Chinese statecraft.

The state of English scholarship on these men and their doctrines is opposite of the scholarship on ancient Chinese strategic thought. Here many books and articles dissecting their theories of statecraft and describing their policy proposals have been written, but there is a dearth of translated material. [12] Thus every book on the Song Dynasty (old style: Sung, 960-1279 AD) has a lengthy section on Wang Anshi's (d. 1086) political program, but there is no complete translation of the celebrated series of memorials in which he laid this program out. The same pattern extends right up to studies on the cusp on the modern era. Wei Yuan (d. 1858), perhaps the most seminal strategic theorist of Qing (Ch'ing, 1644-1912) China, has had several books or articles written about him and is a regular feature of general surveys of the dynasty. [13] However, neither his most famous work on statecraft, nor the famous anthology of writings he collected and published, The Collected Essays on Statecraft of the Great Qing (Huang-Qing Jingshi Wenbian), has been translated into English. Short excerpts from Wang Anshi, Wei Yuan, and the many theorists who lived between them can be found in books like Sources of the Chinese Tradition and China's Response to the West: A Documentary Survey, but these are rarely more than a page or two long and are utterly insufficient for serious comparative study.

Non credo proprio che SEL abbia delle posizioni estremiste, dovrebbe essere di sinistra si, ma inzomma!!

&gt; Ma che bisogna avere la giustificazione scritta dai genitori per votare un partito estremista? Se una persona sente che le sue idee sono meglio rappresentate da un certo partito, lo vota. E' tutto li.

Il mio é interesse sincero, proprio perché é un partito estremista. Non mi interessa un AMA di uno che vota pd o scelta civica o SEL...m5s e lega nord si.

&gt; Altri partiti parlano di solidarietà, accoglienza e amore. A me interessa che la politica immigratoria del nostro paese invece sia decisa su base economica e occupazionale. La Lega con le sue proposte copre in parte queste richieste, che è una cosa che altri partiti non fanno o fanno magari peggio. Chiaramente una gestione dell'immigrazione ottimale passa anche per scelte condivise a livello europeo, che è un tema in cui la lega temo sia molto debole.
Amore non mi pare di averlo mai sentito, l´accoglienza é un dovere di uno stato per quel che mi riguarda e le politiche migratorie dovrebbero considerarla. Al momento non mi pare che il PD abbia aperto le porte ai migranti, usano la marina per pattugliare il mediterraneo...

&gt; Il loro punto di forza è, secondo me, la forte pragmaticità nell'approccio alle questioni.

&gt; Giusto per aggiungere una cosa, io voterei molto più volentieri la lega a livello locale che nazionale e così credo molti degli elettori che si porta dietro. In generale credo che molto dell'elettorato della lega sia proprio quello che ci si può aspettare da un partito così anti-ideologico, ovvero un elettorato non affezionato (o non brainwashed potremmo dire) pronto a sostenere la lega quando si ritrova meglio rappresentata e pronto a mandare la lega al diavolo quando necessario. Al contrario di altri elettori insomma, non è il partito a fare l'elettore qua e secondo me difficilmente si trova qualcuno che ""vota lega"" così come ""voterebbe sinistra"".

How is this the same as **prohibiting jobs that shouldn't exist**? Enabling people to function in a free market is not the same as raising their wages forcefully so they can no longer afford to stay in business. In your overlong reply, you miss the point entirely.

&gt; because of knee jerk emotional reactions to what I can only imagine must be their safe words they use in bed.

Fuck off with your ad hominem bullshit.

&gt; Every free trade agreement kills low wage, low skill jobs in the U.S. and sends it overseas.

Free trade is not the same thing as introducing regulations that force people to stop working (i.e., wage rises that they didn't ask for that'll put them out of work). If someone can compete with the world at large, they are free to do so in a free trade system. We are seeing jobs that *could* survive disappear because you've intervened to *make* them unprofitable, rather than let them become unprofitable from the workings of the market. 

This is a bad analogy and you should feel bad.

Jobs that you'd prefer not to exist because ""they shouldn't exist"".

&gt; First you state they do it because they want to then succeed it with they don't have qualification to do anything else based on lack of qualification.

You can do both at the same time. There's no contradiction between doing a job that you want to and having to settle for what your skills enable you to do.

How are you going to move people from minimum wage work to more skilled work, exactly? How do you produce the jobs that these people were unable to bring themselves into?

0,False,"&gt;The way I understood this is that Eastern Europe suffered immensely under both regimes, but a lot more under Germany.

Everybody suffered - because there was a rare country in first decades of XX century to fully respect and protect it's citizens. 

For example, take US - more people died in the early 30's both in relative and absolute population from hunger than in Soviet Union. But nobody says it was of cleansing against the poor and jobless.

When 5-7 million dies from famine in Soviet Union - it's either cleansing of class of the independent farmers (sane historian) or ethnic cleansing against Ukrainians (insane historian). 

&gt;I tend to believe the historian on that one.

Then do your own investigation if you ever have time. 

The problem with Western investigation is that after the war significant part of collaborators and later soviet dissidents flew to places like US or Canada (mostly Canada). And wrote their version of the story, which is being regarded as 100% truth, while in many cases it's complete falsification or intent to whiten the past crimes.

One of those cases is Katyn massacre. Poland forced from Russian government the admission of those crimes under the version which supported the Polish government in exile. 

How it happened? Well after the German advance in the area some officers claim to have discovered some bodies. Goebbels propaganda machine spins the story that Soviet fiends executed the Polish officers that were in the camp near by. And a number without complete exhumation appears in press 23 thousands or something like that.

From Soviet perspective it makes no sense. After the occupation of Eastern Poland (in our historiography is called liberation of Western Belarus and Ukraine, occupied by Poland 18 years before that) there were around 600 000 Polish military personnel captives. Then among the captives Soviet government decides to execute only those prisoners that are located in the territories that in future will fall under Nazi control. 

Incredible! The rest over 550000 Poles are used for labour camps and during the war will form Anders' Army (around 350 000 people) and Polish Army under Soviet command (the rest). But let's execute the prisoners that are in Smolensk region for some reason. And let's use German guns to do so! That way we achieve... er what do we achieve?

Did Soviet Union execute Polish prisoners? Yes, many (several thousands) were subjected to trial for occupation (1920) and [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camps_for_Russian_prisoners_and_internees_in_Poland_\(1919–24\)) in the occupied territories. And later executed. Did Soviet Union execute those poor souls in Katyn? Surely not.

Even the name Katyn was taken on purpose for that Goebbels propaganda piece. The camp (and so the bodies) were 'found' in Kozy Gory (Goat Mountains), but all the press wrote about Katyn (nerby small village), because kat means executioner in Polish. 

Then pieces of propaganda like this were re-used during the Cold War confrontation without going into the details. Same goes for the famine of the 30's. Nobody mentions that it was the last famine in peace time in our lands. Prior to communist reforms we had famine every decade with similar percentage of people dying, and that going to the most ancient history.

And in current propaganda in the West Soviet regime is tried to be placed on the same scale with Nazi regime in terms of crimes against humanity. Which is completely incorrect. Yes, Soviet Union committed mass-crimes against humanity: deportations of entire villages and even cities based on ethnic category - Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingushs; repressions against people for thought crime - years in labour camps for professing wrong ideology; had 0 tolerance policy - which meant that somebody could be executed for stealing something completely worthless  for exemplary purposes. Also while with good intent - Soviet Union wasn't a force for good in it's short history. But to compare that to Nazi Crimes (genocide, slavery, complete dehumanization and destruction they had in mind) - no sir, that should not be tolerated.

0,False,"Not the same Yak but from same manufacturer.

A good friend of mine bought a Point 65 XP18 a number of years ago. The design was apparently by some Porche engineer.
 If I remember correctly the manufacturing was changed to China from somewhere in Europe.

 A few things over the years that I have picked up while paddling with and in that kayak.

A very fast kayak. The bow is like a razor blade.

Can stow a huge amount of gear quite comfortably. 

Struggles when stowing gear on top, which might not be an issue for some but we like to strap on Coolers and chairs fishing gear and guitar etc. So not great top heavy.

 Easy to get in and out of from shore. Not sure about while one is  mid-water.

 Not sure about pre-Chinese manufacture but it is crappy fibreglass with hulls so thin that sunlight barely has a problem passing through.

 A few small leaks between hulls.

 Rudder was demountable and has a horizontal skeg.

 Rudder cables are thin fibre rather than stainless steel.

 The firbreglass body is very, very fragile. Takes very little to put a dent in it. (Those star/web shaped dings)
 
 The paintwork rubs off with no effort.
 
Has a compass slot in front of cockpit.

Not that great in choppy water.

Not great in windy conditions.

Really, really fast on flat water.

This was the cheaper fibre-glass version. It also came in a carbon composite material but after the shoddy construction in fibre-glass, I would not personally hold too much faith in a carbon/composite build from this company.

I enjoy it immensely, as I said this last season was a titanic battle with The Arsenal that went down too last day, because of fixture congestion and tightness of race I was 2nd most of the season and only won by 2 points.

I change my tactics somewhat with every ''team I make'', I generally have 7-8 year periods for each really good player where they and a bunch of other regens are a ''core'' of the team for the years.
 I adapt to what I have each time (currently avg/ good defenders, except the LB who is a monster, with INSANE midfield and Forwards, no wingers), so I have a halfback (33 and still 4 stars, Turkish  bro) to protect my 3.5 star cb's and 3 star rb, etc etc etc.

Im currently determined to nail scouting down, I have excellent scouts but honestly I find a good half of the regens myself in the countries being scouted, so im not sure what im doing wrong or why my ''excellent'' scouts (20/20, 18+ all stats etc) miss so many, especially when I have 3 assigned to brazil and 3 to argentina.

0,False,"I would agree with you if it wasnt for lag. I have played 3 trials matchs and we lost the first (against a green and 2 red bars who lagged) won the second (I went 8-2) and lost the 3rd to a lagging red+yellow+green. 

Seriously. it is the reason I stopped playing pvp until trials. I think my stats speak for themselves. (destiny tracker PSN: yggdrasilproject). we have a 2.14 K/D and 80% win rate at skirmish. We came from restsiance 2 then MAG (dedicated servers, lag free). We quit pvp almost all together 3-4 months ago. I love the IDEA of trials... but lag roulette is not something I should have to endure AT ALL least of all be penalised when I am put into a BS game. 

Seriously I don't care if it took 5-10 minutes to get a match, EVERYONE should be 'green bars'. I only have 3 matches played (or was there a 4th somewhere, don't recall) but seriously if there was a way of seeing the connection bars THEN doing this I would do it. 

I live in the UK and this was at 7pm on a saturday (so it should be pretty lively for finding close matches connection wise). I hate the fact I will probably never see mercury because of lag, and the fact it is so bad means I am never going to get my team back into it. 

If there was a way to cheese that wasn't crazy amount of effort and involved finding 2 other cheesers... I would do it. The annoying thing is Osiris weapons are significantly better than the PVE queens stuff. I still play the PVE and this pisses me off. Why should I be locked out of 'the best' gear (or at least very good gear) because bungie were cheap with servers. I thought you learned the lesson when all the PVP people complained when they couldn't get decent gear (why you added iron banner giving higher light)... Now you have just done the EXACT OPPOSITE except PVP players weren't massively screwed in PVE the same way people like me and my friends are massively handicapped playing PVP. 

Losing to lag in something like trials is frustrating. I can only imagine how much worse it would of been if I pulled my old team together (they are real life buddies and would be up for it if I asked) and we won some games only to have it broken by lag.

Basically games need dedicated servers to begin with, then throw some over to us in the EU, or at the very least not all but lock out content/gear for us because you are being cheap. 

I still remember trying iron banner 2.0 for the first time where the entire other team had red bars. Seriously? your matchmaking is THAT bad... I never did more than a handful of games in iron banner as a result (although I did once go 20+ unbroken in solo queue) and I definitely couldn't convince the team to do it. 

I know this is a rant, but it is an issue I never see adressed. All my local friends hate the lag and think the PVP is BS. Everyone online I meet tells me it isn't a problem. I had 3 or 4 guys all say 'I got lagged in normal crucible all the time, but trials has been really good for me'... well it wasn't for me, and I find the principle of being locked out of content/awesome weapons just as frustrating as the laggy BS games themselves. 

You can't have fun playing when wins and losses lock you out of loot and you repeatedly lose due to lag you have no control over (FYI I have 150 MB/s connection and have no problems in any game with dedicated servers/on PC etc). I love destiny, but if destiny 2 doesn't have dedicated servers I definitely won't be buying it despite my 600-700+ hours in this game already. PVE content has been a mix of great and awful. I love VoG and the arena but TDB was an abortion both from a raid perspective and the whole upgrading exotics thing. I had every exotic at the time and stupidly upgraded them all to 331 and realised I would NEVER get enough experience to re-level them all. The task just seemed like a stupid amount of BS piled on top of only having the awful TDB content to grind them on because everything else was stale... I like HoW a lot, but it has only gone so far to making up for TDB. If I hadn't already paid for it, I wouldn't be back, and my friends didn't even come back despite that.

The Eurogroup comes in and asks for reform packages and they come with ideologies when what they need to have are pages upon pages of projected cash flows that various concrete reforms will bring.

Everyone seems to miss the point about these sorts of projections, it's not about being exactly right, it's about knowing how to steer the ship when things aren't following the course you set. (e.g. revenues lower than projected means optional spending needs to be postponed....but it all needs to be planned well in advance)

They come with plans that are basically political stump speeches of ""we will reform the tax system"" when the lenders follow that up with ""Great! What are the projected cash flows for that sort of reform and how exactly will it affect the Greek current accounts?""

By all accounts of the rumor mill, they just don't have an answer for that. While I certainly don't agree with their ideology, I'm not going to go so far as to say it's unworkable, but their incompetence in government will sink the Greek state.

She was a member of the [Capetian House of Anjou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capetian_House_of_Anjou), the daughter of king [Louis I of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_I_of_Hungary) and [Elizabeth of Bosnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Bosnia). 

&gt;[Queens regnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_regnant) being relatively uncommon in Europe at the time, Jadwiga was officially crowned a ""king"" (*rex*) rather than ""queen"" (*regina*). 

&gt;She is an important link in the transition of the [Polish monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_monarchy) from the extinguished [House of Piast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piast) to the [Jagiellon dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellon_dynasty) (Lithuanian in origin).

0,False,"&gt; All of culture is changing, its not static. So if language doesn't need to be changed because its changing, why not culture in general, which also is changing?

It doesn't necesarily change fast enough or in a great direction.

&gt;And culture/personal beliefs and feelings of 7 billion people are not?

Not the same thing at all. Besides, I have not advocated changing everybody's culture in all its aspects. You're putting words in my mouth. I'm encouraging introspection and careful analysis, which doesn't mean discarding everything mindlessly, quite the opposite.

&gt;How do you know? Are you saying these people are objectively wrong?

I think they are seriously misguided and naïve. Their project has failed to bring results in over a century. Besides, they didn't even try to make their work actually international, it's mostly a mish mash of European languages. That's why people make fun of them.

&gt;Holidays have a huge practical effect. I remove all holidays, you don't think that has a practical effects? We make every Monday and Friday a holiday, you don't think that has a practical effect?

The problem here is that you keep arguing against things I never said. I never said you should change languages or holidays. I don't care about these things (well, I do, but not for the sake of this argument) because they aren't the problem here. They work fine. I'm mostly opposed to things like fundamentalism, obscurantism, that sort of thing.

&gt;But you are saying lets change culture, that itself has huge scale and inertia. How can you justify your change one way but then use this excuse?

Inertia and scale applies only when discussing why a culture has traditions that no longer work. If you make a concerted effort to change policy and traditions over a single generation it's not the same thing at all compared to a culture slowly evolving over many generations.

&gt;Thats fine, then they will naturally adjust the traditions, just like they always have. Its self-correcting and no need for interference. 

Like I said, inertia. If your self correction takes centuries, you're boned and/or people will have suffered for nothing.

&gt;Then competition isn't relevant then and you don't need to change culture. It will survive so why change? 

That's like saying a person with gonorrhea should NOT seek treatment because the disease is non fatal. It's a disease and it's painful, even if your life is not in immediate danger, you have to take action. You have to at least try to improve things.

&gt;Luck works both ways. You could purposely change and it could be detrimental. 

True, but I wonder how simple things like encouraging education can have any drawbacks.

&gt;Except for language and anything else that has ""inertia and scale""?

0,False,"I read **The Better Angels of Our Nature** by Stephen Pinker, and I am rather skeptical of it. Beyond the fact that it wasn't a terribly fun read - I admit, I got so bored by the end that I just skimmed the last chapter - I disagree with his methodology, and therefore his conclusions. To be fair, I think some of it is compelling, but I think he misses a lot of the nuance of what violence actually is if he focuses exclusively on death rates and murder rates. He somewhat acknowledges this in some of the chapters about animal abuse and rape, but not sufficiently, I think, to get over the fact that his thesis relies on murder and death rather than other forms of violence to make its point. Beyond that, it's very Eurocentric, in that its idea of freedom is based very much in liberal European ideals such that he discounts democracies in, say, South Korea and Japan as true democracies because those societies don't subscribe to European values. He also falls victim to the idea that hunter-gatherer societies have remained unchanged, and that their current violent rates have always been there instead of being, say, responses to external pressure like violence rates pretty much everywhere else. It's a flawed book, and it's not a terribly interesting read, but I do think the idea at the heart of it is an interesting one, even if it's not as well supported as I wish it was.

I then read **The Aquariums of Pyongyang** by Kang Chol-hwan, a North Korean defector to South Korea. This is another book that I wish had more substance to it, but I also completely understand that it's a painful subject for its author. However, I think if you're looking for a story or collection of stories about North Korea and life in North Korea, *Nothing to Envy* by Barbara Demick provides a much more complete picture. Nothing against Kang and his experiences, but I just found that his story felt incomplete.

I also read the first nine books of the **Dresden Files.** A friend recommended the series to me, and while I'd read a couple in the wrong order, this is my first time reading them straight and in order. I really love this series. It starts off slow and not terribly interesting, but it rapily gets a lot more interesting as Dresden runs into more and more interesting characters and situations, and is forced to balance more and more threads and problems.

For example, PPI. Consumers made a choice about that, and those that took it were mislead. Consumers don't know as much as their suppliers.

American Companies (and British ones soon to join together and become BP) take all the oil under forced ""concessions"" that allow private companies to take nationalized oil reserves.

World War 2: Everything the west does is for Oil. Russia defends the Caucasus (Leningrad/Stalingrad) for dear life because Germans (in operation Barbarossa) want the Caucasus because it has 100 octane fuel, that would give BF109s and FW190s the edge with American/British/Russian planes who were also running on 100 Octane fuel. The only reason Germany wanted Russia was for Oil, and Farmland for a larger Germany. In Africa, Germany begins it's campaign over oil. American and European Companies again use Middle eastern states for oil.

Cold War: Russia makes satellite states out of middle eastern countries that have oil. Iran Contras (under Reagan) was used to increase relations with Iran, that held oil. The money was used to fund Nicaraguan Revolutionaries who would also end up giving oil to the US.

There's a couple of kid's trains that go around the Bulvar, here is one in front of the Museum Centre, which was originally built as the Baku branch of the Moscow Lenin Museum. It presently houses the national dramatic arts museum as well as the independence museum. It used to house the carpet museum, though it has since moved to a new, dedicated building down the Bulvar.

##MUM and other Soviet Department stores

([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/2sGgy))

&gt;MUM (moom like Moomin) is Baku's modest version of the palatial [GUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUM_(department_store/)) (goom) in Moscow. Both served as state-run department stores, and after the fall of the USSR, they became groups of individually run stalls. Fun fact about the names MUM &amp; GUM: in Russian, GUM stands for Glavnyi Universalnyi Magazin (""main universal store”, but under Soviet rule was “Gosudarstvennyi” for “state”) while the one in Baku uses the Azeri variation Merkezi Univermaq (Central Department Store) to play on that. 

Exterior:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/1fuswPw.jpg

Typical interior (this 2nd level has original flooring); Soviet era department stores were more like shopping arcades:

Here's another one called BUM (“boom”, I assume Baky Univermaq), also known as the “New Department Store”. 

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/9bDIeJe.jpg

Here the interior of one store was converted into a banquet hall, the opulence was common as Soviet design emphasized beautiful common areas to be enjoyed by the public. Private spaces are much more spartan.

##Heydar Aliyev Center

&gt;The Heydar Aliyev Center, a complex consisting of museums, auditorium and multi-purpose hall, designed by renowned Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid. Finished in 2014, the fully realized work won an international award (and not a bullshit one). 

Here is the Center (right) with the new Convention Centre on the left:

This display in front of a history/cultural exhibit on Azerbaijan represents the many threads that are woven together to form the country.

This model of the newly opened Carpet Museum on the Bulvar ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/eWdgu)) does a better job of conveying the shape of a rolled carpet:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/tqH01R9.jpg

They had a display of the official state gifts that were given to the previous president, including the eagle at the center given by Clinton and the eagle paperweight and Truman stamp flanking it that were given by George W. Bush (he received two of the eagle paperweight from Bush). 

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/HmGGiK2.jpg

While I was there the Turkish Ambassador came through on a tour (suddenly the museum security all looked alert and then two dozen men in suits followed two guys talking). Turkey and Azerbaijan, being the most culturally related (and sharing a small border on Azerbaijan's exclave) have a bit of a Best Friends Forever vibe going on. I looked outside and saw his motorcade parked in front. 

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/bhUQrPa.jpg

Apparently Azeri is close enough to Turkish that they can mostly understand each other (and quickly learn the other language), but Azeris have a sing-songy accent. 

View of the city from the Heydar Aliyev Center, that wedge shaped building at the center is the Trump Tower... ugh. The odd location is even more awkward than his hotel-timeshare in Vegas.

Council Recommendation

The Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments was adopted, as the result of consultation and legislative process, on 30 November 2009, calling on Member States to act in three main fronts:

&gt;    Adopt and implement laws to fully protect their citizens from exposure to tobacco smoke in enclosed public places, workplaces and public transport, within three years of the adoption of the Recommendation
&gt;    Enhance smoke-free laws with supporting measures such as protecting children, encouraging efforts to give up tobacco use and pictorial warnings on tobacco packages.
&gt;    Strengthen cooperation at EU level by setting up a network of national focal points for tobacco control.


It's not really a directive indeed but still, regulations on smoking in the EU tend to be simular. Even if Germany is not yet banning smoking in bars. Banning smoking in bars is still something relatively new in the countries that do ban it.

LOL, 'Latvijas Gaze' is de facto controlled by Gazprom so no wonder they do not want to buy competitor gas :) We had the same situation in Lithuania but we decided to kick out Gazprom as soon as it was possible in civilized manner because we implemented the rules of EU 3rd energetic packet and Gazprom was forced to sell all of its shares of 'Lithuanian gas' in 2014. If I'm not mistaken, Latvia will implement such rules only in 2017.
Meanwhile Estonia, which is also more or less free of Gazprom BS, already is importing quarter of its all used gas from Lithuania and that share is increasing - Lithuania became regional gas re-exporter, that exactly was one of the goals when building LNG terminal:

&gt;Каждый четвертый кубометр газа, потребляемый в Эстонии, куплен в Литве. Его стоимость за мегаватт в час примерно на пять евро дешевле, чем продаваемого при посредничестве Eesti Gaas. Если в марте крупные потребители в Эстонии закупили на литовской бирже в общей сложности 18% потребленного здесь газа, то в апреле — уже 27%.

&gt;...«Литовский рынок газа самый развитый. Там есть конкуренция и это вызвало ситуацию, когда литовский СПГ-терминал и поставляемый оттуда газ, а также поступающий из России газ, конкурируют между собой и цена формируется в результате спроса и предложения. Это является, скажем так, справедливой рыночной ценой», - пояснил руководитель отдела торговли энергоносителями Eesti Energia Хейкко Мяэ.

&gt;По словам Вескимяги, газ в Литве стоит дешевле благодаря возникшей после открытия СПГ-терминала конкуренции. В долгосрочных планах от этого могут выиграть и жители Эстонии, потребляющие газ в бытовых целях, хотя для этого должен возникнуть интерес у посредников.

http://rus.err.ee/v/economy/1ff0b38b-8484-4bad-bf1e-c7a2e2b7d63f

And even Gazprom itself is going to 'waste' Russian taxpayers money exactly the same way Lithuania did and is building LNG terminal in Kaliningrad despite having land pipeline from Russia. Look, you should write angry and rightful 'donos' on Gazprom chief Miller and send it to Sledstvynij komitet, guess he even got a lot of money into his bank account :)))

Nice start with your lies. Devs can license the source code and they cannot share it with anyone who doesn't have a license. 

&gt;PR campaigns to prevent competition.

PR campaigns to bring attention to the issue of these functions only working(well) on specific hardware. I don't see where they are trying to prevent competition. They just want a fair playing ground.

&gt;The fear of being attacked and financially ruined if choose a competing service or competing software.

What? Does AMD have secret ties with publishers or what? Publishers are going to stop the cash flow if the devs use NV proprietary software?

&gt;DirectX provides a level playing field That is what AMD is expected to interact with. If there are problems they can report them to the dev. If the dev doesn't fix the issues AMD can patch it in the driver.
They get the shader intermediate code and that is what they have to make micro code from. That is the level playing field. That level playing field will be coming to Linux soon too. Say goodbye to shader source code access. Devs don't want people looking at their source code. The intermediate code restricts things enough.

Thanks to DirectX games themselves run on every hardware. When you start implementing additional software to add options that don't come with DirectX, such as Hairworks, these options become unavailable to optimization. AMD can't fully optimize these features without source code, nor can the devs. At least the devs can license the source code if they so wish, which again contradicts what you say in the end of the paragraph. 

&gt;It's a side effect of ""It just works"", that is everything gets QA or doesn't work.

That is why Hairworks ""just works"" so well on only Maxwell cards, HA! Why isn't the feature completely disabled on older NV cards then? Or why isn't the feature disabled when AMD cards are detected? 

Nice try at the excuse though.

&gt;The chart says Hairworks(Call Of Duty: Ghosts)

Maybe you shouldn't take all your information out of a fucking image. COD is in parenthesis because it is an example of a game running Hairworks. This paragraph accompanies the image: 

""In the below diagram, **we isolated the specific routine** that renders these competing hair technologies and plotted the results. The bars indicate the portion of time required, in milliseconds, to render the hair from start to finish within one frame of a user’s total framerate. In this scenario, a lower bar is better as that demonstrates quicker time to completion through more efficient code.""

Bolded for your pleasure.

&gt;The intel Compiler thing was a lot smaller than this.

Holy fuck. What Intel did was as anti competitive as possible for sucks sake. They made deals with Dell, Lenovo, HP, and NEC in exchange for a commitment by them to buy almost all of their x86 CPUs from Intel. Intel had also awarding payments to HP, Acer, and Lenovo on the condition they cancel or delay AMD CPU-based products or by restricting their distribution.

**Intel's fine remains the largest ever for breaching Europe's competition laws.**

""The intel Compiler thing was a lot smaller than this."" LOL! I can't fucking believe these fucking lies that come straight out of your fucking mouth.

&gt;Nvidia is just a corporation.

Yeah, exactly. They're doing everything to get more profit. Profit is the single aim for corporations. If not for competition laws, NV would have definitely done some backroom deals similar to Intel.

 It comes from watching the EU welcome  flawed democracies with little prospects into their folds, setting standards for Turkey to fullfill that aren't required for other candidate states and the lack of confirmation that Turkey WILL actually join the EU after meeting all the criteria.

In general, the answer is possibly but not many. There may be isolated cases that no one ever heard of but the Soviet rivalry was not exactly that instant.

If there were organized soldiers in Soviet controlled areas near the end or after the war, it would be permissible for them to be repatriated.

I'm not certain where American POWs would be kept but it certainly would not be in Eastern Europe. That's where most of the death camps or extermination camps were. Unless you were Jewish, homosexual or a nuisance to the Nazis, American POWs should not be present east of Germany and out of reach of the Soviets. Also remember that Germans were VERY good with paperwork. Something like XX amount of soldiers sent to Y camp in region Z would show up somewhere.

This contrasts with the ""Neverendum Fudge"" of tinkering that Open Europe speak up so much about so little:-

I believe that the west still is more scared of socialism than Islamism. The ideas of al Baghdadi would have a hard time taking root in western nations whereas socialist ideas already have roots here . Considering the increasing inequality between the rich and the poor the ideas from the left are more of a threat than radical Islam.

And then you would leave the vast oil reserves of Saud up for grabs. Even if Saudi Arabia would prefer to have the west as customers I doubt that they would think twice before taking on China an Russia as their new VIP clients. This would be a huge problem for the west because whoever took our place would have more influence over the oil market and the middle east in general.

0,False,"It's a bit complicated. Here's the gist: the commission is the oldest institution and has changed a lot over the years. Every member state gets to appoint one commissioner. The president of the commission is chosen in a similar fashion to a prime minister, i.e. the lead candidate of the largest European parliament group can try to form a majority. This time the centre-right EPP is the largest group, so their candidate (Juncker) became president. Since his colleagues are appointed by the member states, he doesn't get to choose his ministers the way a PM can, but he can tell them what job to do. They lead the rest of the EU's civil servants. Personally, I think it's pretty similar to how any normal country would be run, but obviously not identical.

Anyway, the commission's job is to enforce the EU treaties and propose new legislation. In fact, they are the only ones able to do so. Once a proposal has been submitted, both council and parliament can amend and change it as they wish.

And if you're trying to tell me that Wolf didn't play horridly in the bo5 you're just being biased or you didn't watch the series. EDG is a good team, but they didn't win that series. SKT lost it. You can't base a team's strength off of one tournament in the middle of the season. If that were the case, Gambit would have been the strongest EU team going into last split. That wasn't the case.

LGD has not been good this split. They were good last split, but ever since Pyl took a bit of time off, they have been average at best. I don't know if you don't actually watch the games or anything, but if you did, you'd know that LGD is pretty much playing like OMG did last split: they aren't consistently good right now. When they win, they win hard. When they lose, it's pretty bad. And it's not like they're only losing to top tier teams. They're going 1-1 with mid range/bottom range teams. If they start to show like they did last split, I agree they're a top team in China. Right now though, they're not even close.

I'm not ""overestimating KR"". They're just better. Reddit kids don't care about watching games or hearing what people have to say, they just look at random tournament results and base it off of that. Go look at any interview with top tier pro players, they will all still say Korea is the best.

 - New UI! Damn, it looks great and takes a little less space than in EW/EU.
 - Aim seems pretty standard, but I like that they show us what makes the shot more/less precise.
 - Crit is awfully low. Either their armor gives them a Hardened perk or it'll work different. (Or it just doesn't work on unsuspecting enemies.)
 - The abilities! First and last one looks like some kind of drone control, like assemble/disassemble. Maybe it'll be some kind of spotter for this ranger dude?

 - 5 is probably stealth. It looks like one. I suspect, that it's Ranger's class ability. You know, yellow icon and such.
 - The backpack on the left of the weapon could show how much they can carry. Something like: Smoke Grenade - 1 weight = 1 box.
 - The icon for the gun is great! Much more detailed than in EW/EU. Boxes under it probably mean ammo left in it.

well, in the case of France specifically, there used to be myriad regional languages (not mere dialects), of which only a few still struggle to survive. They were deliberately and systematically eradicated as explicit government policy in order to establish a centralised administration (and, so I've been told, improve battlefield efficiency), and this emphasis of the primacy of standardised French continues to this day, e.g. the refusal to recognise surviving dialects officially (as hundreds of others are throughout the EU) and in the Toubon Law.

&gt; Since the 1790s, the French government has waged a campaign of extermination against the regional languages of France, first refusing to teach them, then starving them of funds and banning them in the public sphere.

0,False,"I never said R1a plays any role in the development of language, religion, and culture. But, most ethnic groups had their own language and religion and they carried these with them, when they migrated. These migration are tracked by the current distribution of the Y and mt-haplogroups and some other markers. 

The current prevailing consensus is that R1a tribes were the carrier of the Proto-Indo-European languages and possibly among the first to domesticate the horse. 

The date of the migration has been pushed back to 7000 BC according to new research like  2009 Underhill et al. Thus, the Indo-European arrival and fall of Indus Civilisation had no relation. Some form of religion probably existed before that, including in the Indus Valley, and it was probably influenced by their arrival. Even the Rig Veda was written after their arrival. The common divine characters of ancient Teutonic and Nordic religion, points to a common origin.

The Pashupati Seal does not refer to Shiva. Shiva did not exist in that form in the Vedic period. The Vedic analogue for Shiva was Ghora, a completely different kinda character. Furthermore, Indus Valley script has been unreadable and considered logographic. Even if it is phonographic as claimed by a small group, it shows no similarities with Brahmi which is a known phonographic. Brahmi in fact has shown more similarity to Phoenician than Indus script. (I am not expanding on many other points here.)  

Conclusion:

* The Indo-Europeans influenced the religion is some ways, and possibly introduced horse and the proto-Brahmi script. 

* The similarity in myth, symbols, and language points to a common origin of religion. But derivatives of this religion were erased in European and Central Asia by Christianity and later Islam.

* Currently, the only out of India mass migration into Europe confirmed by genetics, is in the H1a Y-haplogroup clade. Not R1a.

This is the current consensus. I won't jump to any conclusion before newer studies are carried out.

My problem isn't even pug groups because eventually you hit a point even as a new tank where your competency will outshine any flaws. WoW's normal and heroic dungeons only require a minimal amount of gear and competency in playing your class and role, nothing more.

My problem is actually my experience with guilds and players on the realms I used to play on (i.e. Turalyon-EU, Emerald Dream-EU and Bladefist-EU.)

And I don't agree with the notion that it's common courtesy to study boss tactics, because there are lots of players who can't be bothered to do it, and because a lot of bosses have very straightforward, blindingly obvious tactics.

In Final Fantasy XIV, the groups are overwhelmingly friendly and will happily explain boss tactics. The big incentive is [Player Commendations and the title and vanity item rewards they provide.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Player_Commendation) I'd even consider FFXIV to be more difficult than WoW in terms of its raid content.

In Wildstar, the groups are somewhere between friendly and douchebags. Some will happily explain boss tactics, others will flame at you for not knowing boss tactics. That's generally because Wildstar is more of a hardcore game with a smaller community than most other MMOs, and because attacks are very clearly telegraphed unlike other MMOs. When Wildstar goes F2P later this year, I imagine this'll be a different story entirely.

A lack of infrastructure, harsher rules being applied to CAF and AFC members than UEFA members (I addressed this elsewhere), lack of investment from FIFA, and yes, spots being available to CAF and AFC teams is a big deal. There are currently 46 members from AFC and 56 from CAF. AFC and CAF were in constant conflict for better distribution of FIFA revenues to football development.

When CAF and AFC countries were lobbying to boycott apartheid South Africa, FIFA and UEFA continued to ignore those calls and allowed South Africa to participate in world football and lifted their suspension that was placed on them by CAF. It wasn't until 1976 that SA was expelled from FIFA. **15 years after African and Asian nations called for their expulsion**.

&gt;On 26 September 1961 at the annual FIFA conference, the South African association was formally suspended from FIFA. **Sir Stanley Rous, president of The Football Association of England and a champion of South Africa's FIFA membership, was elected FIFA President a few days later. Rous was adamant that sport, and FIFA in particular, should not embroil itself in political matters and against fierce opposition he continued to resist attempts to expel South Africa from FIFA. The suspension was lifted in January 1963 after a visit to South Africa by Rous in order to investigate the state of football in the country.**

&gt;Rous declared that if the suspension were not lifted, football there would be discontinued, possibly to the point of no recovery. The next annual conference of FIFA in October 1964 took place in Tokyo and was attended by a larger contingent of representatives from African and Asian associations and here the suspension of South Africa's membership was re-imposed. In 1976, after the Soweto uprising, they were formally expelled from FIFA.

The German and Austrian collaboration to keep Algeria out of the World Cup Round of 16 in 1982 is also an example of European teams working together to keep out an African team from further qualification.

Who said it did?  
The global crisis was but a trigger that turned on the bomb that decades of overspending in countries like greece and portugal created.  
Other countries were prepared for an event of the sort, they invested money into structural reforms, fomenting investment in productivity, investing public money on primary and secondary segments of the economy.  
Portugal, for instance, has an economy built on services, close to 80% in fact, which is a sign of an economy who isn't sane. You can't export hairdressers, or restaurants, or telecommunications, etc.  
We should have used the money we got from the EU to increase incentives to factories, agricultural production, fishing, etc.  
Instead, we used it to build the two biggest bridges in the EU, in a country smaller than most US states.   
  
As far as the ""right-wing"" Kool-Aid you mention, its easy to speak of other countries's details when you don't live in them. Portugal has had a constitution that was created in the revolution's aftermath, and was considered (and still is) almost unanimously to be a left-leaning constitution. You can't fire public sector employees, for instance. Imagine you work in a public school. If you're terrible at your job, you get a bad review. If you were a private sector employee, you'ld be gone. Instead, you're put on courses on the public sector. And the next year, if you get another bad review, you go back to courses. You just can't get fired if you're terrible at your job.  
  
&gt; Let us solve this global recession that has nothing to do with overspending  
  
I'm pretty sure i already debunked these premises. You're mixing apples and oranges. A short term problem, the debt crisis followed by the euro crisis in europe, exposed a long term problem in some developed countries.   
  
As for a welfare state, if you think the welfare state is gone in troika-interventioned countries, you really don't know what's going on here.

It's quite simple. You have to have a decent professional national league to really play Football competitively on the international stage, without this a country does not have teams to draft professional players from or an effective governing body that can finance itself and manage the effort of a national team. 

There were no professional leagues, and in some cases there still are no professional sports leagues in those regions, for a variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of any football association. Without this a team has no hope to be successful and a national football association is just hollow shell.

Without the ability to finance themselves these associations are 100% dependent on FIFA for their funding, either directly, or by selling their votes; and since nobody in Montserrat really cares about the football association of Montserrat until its time to vote in FIFA these positions are treated like private concessions to be used to generate money. If there is any case to be made it is that associations may not join or vote in FIFA until they can finance and police themselves. 

The idea that European nations are trying to keep down other nations joining the sport, is ridiculous.

The conservative half of the country has always been apprehensive towards the West, which is just typical of that culture anyway. The EU push has been largely driven by the liberal secularists, but after decades of being treated so fucking unfairly, even they don't want anything to do with the EU anymore.

0,False,"&gt;How easy is it to get a driver's license?

If you don't have one, get a drivers license ASAP as long as you are still in the USA. It is relatively easy and cheap to convert your US drivers license to a German one within the first six months of staying here and I strongly recommend doing that. If you don't, you'll have to take lessons in Germany, which will be quite expensive. 

&gt;Car?

If you are working with Mercedes, you are expected to drive one. Workers get discounted models straight from the factory, so many sell cars that are about 1-3 years old and get a new one. For this reason there is a large supply of used Mercedes in the area. It should be fairly easy to pick up a ten year old Mercedes in good condition. Failing that, a used VW Golf or similar small car is the way to go. 

&gt;How is public transportation in the more rural areas of the country?

The Mercedes-Benz factory in Sindelfingen is well-covered by public transport. A car is nice to have, but you can get around without one just fine. 

&gt;What is a livable salary? 

Depends upon your idea of liveable and whether it is brutto (before taxes and social security payments) or netto (after taxes and social security payments). Rent will be around 400 EUR, food and body hygiene around 200 EUR per month. So as a rule of thumb you need around 700-800 EUR netto to live and have a little bit of fun, this translates to roughly 1000 EUR per month brutto. 

&gt;How easy will it be to explore other parts of Europe?

Depends how much you get paid. Travelling in Europe is very expensive, it is very easy to blow 3000 EUR on a four week trip even if you stay at hostels and eat food from the supermarket. Plus you are there for training. You will be very restricted regarding the days you can take off and you need to study when you are not working, which will be on the weekends. 

Don't expect to get much travelling in apart from maybe two weeks a year, for which you'll need to save up every cent.

0,False,"C9 vs TSM - This is a tough matchup, since they are considered the 2 best teams, plus scrim partners. I believe this matchup will go 1-1, First game going to TSM, as they tend to be very agresive early and simply, seems they can definitely take the game, 2nd game going to C9, as they usually get back on their feet. This game can also go 2-0 in favor of C9 and i'd suppose this is the safer bet. 

Legion vs Denial, both teams have great players. Both teams showed that they are worthy of the pro league. As much as i like Denial, but i think both games will go to legion here. Or this can also be 1-1, first game going to Denial. 

Enemy vs cog. I honestly don't see the outcome of this, i dont like either of them and they both seem like the worst teams in the pro league (no offense to anyone of course) 

AFK - EGR, well Egr is my fav team so i always give out my votes to them and cheer for them to win, but as you probably want to win points and stuff, my prediction would be a 1-1, first game going to EGR. Both teams are pretty great, but i see Alied as being an amazing hunter that really plays safely, while zapman is the agresore ALL the time. I think egr will pull off some great tactics in game1 and AFK will just be not prepared for that, but they should take the 2nd game.

Nox vs ldn con. Again same with titan-trig. Ldn conspiracy just seems like a better team and i really don't expect nox to win.  prediction - 2-0 in favor of ldn con.

Stars - dig, another tough match, both teams don't seem to be superior to eachother, i predict probably a 1-1 game.  (no idea who takes the first)

Fnatic - epsilon, both great teams, adapting being an amazing jungler, but so is captaintwig, well damn.. I kinda expect a 1-1 game, first game going to fnatic.

Yes to that as well.

Absolutely yes.

&gt;I know it sucked for loyal japanese americans, just terrible, but we were at war. And the japanese had spies planted in america.

Still racist.

&gt;When muslims are blowing up buildings, forcing women into essentially slavery, beheading people that disagree with them, and just in general terrorizing the world at large, saying they wont stop until the entire world is ruled by sharia law and all infidels are dead, why wouldn't people be afraid of them?

All Muslims? Nope. A vanishingly small number: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140506/14033627137/how-many-terrorists-are-there-not-as-many-as-you-might-think.shtml

&gt;I know not ALL muslims are like that, and there are bad people in every religion, but I don't remember hearing about the last time a Christian or a Buddhist sent a child into a hotel lobby with a bomb strapped on their chest to kill as many civilians as possible.

Even if you had heard those things, it'd still be shitty to judge each individual, or the entire group, by the actions of a tiny minority.

&gt;Sorry, good muslims, I know that sucks for you, but it's part of reality. It doesn't make anybody racist and it doesn't make them bad people.

Racist? Yes, yes it does. Bad people? Maybe, maybe not. You can be a little bit racist and be an OK person.

&gt;And it's wrong and stupid to try to shame people for their legitimate feelings of fear. All that is really going to do is make them hate you more, bc you are writing off their fears as making them terrible people. So they will internalize it, and they may not say it in public, but they will damn sure still feel it.

Shame isn't the best motivator, but sometimes it works.

0,False,"I'm a bit rushed, so to quote wiki: 

&gt;It also requires the judiciary (including tribunals) to take account of any decisions, judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, and to interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. However, if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the Convention, the judges.. .. issue a declaration of incompatibility.

So, under the current system the British judiciary can place an obligation (if a somewhat ineffectual one) on parliament to change the law. Under the terms of the convention, an international obligation can be placed on the UK state as a whole (not parliament) to change the law. Effectively I can't see it making much difference other than removing these powers from the British courts, or at least altering them, whilst freeing them from an obligation to always 'interpret legislation, as far as possible, in a way which is compatible with Convention rights' - however, to the best of my knowledge, it would not prohibit them from doing so and they would probably continue to do so. **So basically the purpose of this** is to remove the incorporation of the ECHR into the actual legal system and reduce it to an international obligation upon the state once again.

EDIT: edited to make clear it would probably not remove the power of the British courts to declare a declaration of incompatibility altogether.

EDIT 2: Added a bit more stuff. And to be even more clear, because the purpose of the HRA is to incorporate the ECHR and the decisions of the ECtHR into national law, and the purpose of the new bill would be to establish the British courts as supreme on the subject of human rights, the concept of a 'declaration of incompatibility' would necessarily have to be changed, but I imagine a new function would be given to courts so they are able to place an obligation upon parliament.

0,False,"As you know, in Europe, the Tervuren and Malinois are two varieties of the same breed (the Belgian shepherd)  Breeding in between the varieties requires approval through the FCI, if I recall correctly. However, Malinois can produce Tervuren, but Tervuren cannot produce Malinois. 

In working lines (schutzhund, ring sport, some of the agility dogs) having Tervuren come out of Malinois breedings is common enough, but usually the Tervuren have much shorter or lesser coats than Tervuren from many generations of Tervuren. 

Here are 2 Tervuren breeders in Norway. I do not know or support either breeder, it is just for an example. [Tangterr](http://www.tangterr.net/13724947) is a showing line and [Tarkatan](http://www.tarkatan.com/indexkaksi.htm) is a working line. Here are 2 Malinois breeders, [Taikatalven](http://www.taikatalven.com/dogs.html) is a show line, and [Tama on](http://www.tamaon.com/english/engindex.html) is a working line. Just by looking, you can see the difference in appearance. Appearance is not the only difference. 

Generally show lines have less GO-RUN-GO!!! than the working lines. Generally they are a little softer, more biddable (willing to listen to you instead of doing what they want to do), and family/people friendly because they have a stronger breeding for companionship. Working lines tend to be harder and more willing to get what they want, and they don't necessarily want to deal with your family or friends. There are mixed lines, where people show AND work their dogs, so you get a bit of both worlds. NO belgian should be aggressive or hostile in normal life. If the post man comes, your dog should not be running out ready to bite. 

Working Tervuren and Working Malinois will have similar temperaments and attitudes, they will be serious and hard worker but with a lot of energy and need for direction. In general, show line Tervuren will be the ""easiest"", and show Malinois will be in between the working lines and the show Tervuren. THIS IS IN GENERAL!  I had a show line Tervuren from Belgian and French lines, and she was more than able to go toe-to-toe with any working line dog. Some breeders who show have dogs with very big personalities and a lot of drive, so do be aware of that!

Anna Orenius is in Finland, if you look up agility akatemia you will find her. She is a World Agility team member and runs her Tervuren in agility. She would be very good to train with if your girlfriend is serious.

&gt;It can rise and fall in an instant.  If oil prices had gone down or remained as low as they were Russia wouldn't be in the same position.  

During the worst of the fallen oïl prices the economy grew at 0,4%...

Also It depend, oïl is only 16% of our GDP. The economy has a strong industrial base that as soon the economy crash start to take over the growth.

The debt to GDP is ratio in Russia is low at around 14%. There is almost no leverage in the economy — not on the household side, surely not on the government side and even most corporations are not over-levered with debt. That makes it easier for Russia to insulate itself.

They also had to secure licensing for DLC, register trademarks, run it through ESBR and PEGI, and other feed involved in bringing the game to a new region. They had to change event gear designs and figure out which event gear they could and could not bring over. 

&gt;Second this game looks like a side series for Monster Hunter

It's quite definitely main series. It has the same core gameplay, same development team, fits into the yearly release schedule. As for if it will get a G version, it's hard to tell. They broke patterns, we can't rely on precedent. The naming convention doesn't fit with the usual patterns. We can't tell if it's another game in 4th gen or the first game of 5th gen. If it's 4th gen, this is the first time there's been a game released in a generation *after* a G version. 

&gt;just be some form of DLC rather than a whole new game.

That doesn't happen in Monster Hunter. DLC is always finished before launch and located on-disc/cart. They don't add anything after launch, instead the immediately start working on the next game. In 11 years of Monster Hunter they have not added content post-launch once.

6 months is actually average for localization. Most games, not just Monster Hunter, take around that to come from Japan to the West. The 4 months between MH4G and MH4U was short, most MH games have been around 6 months. It just takes that long to get through the whole process. International releases like you see for Pokemon are rare, and only happen for franchises that are hugely popular worldwide. Monster Hunter is hugely popular in Japan and growing in the rest of the world.

The seller was not very helpful when I contacted her, so I was a little disappointed. I ended up just popping it back in but it didn't look the same. **So-so rating**

[Bird Seed Favors from NatureFavors $115](https://www.etsy.com/listing/82868283/100-bird-seed-heart-wedding-favors-free?ref=shop_home_feat_1) I was SO excited about these, but when they showed up about 15 of them basically disintegrated when I unpacked them. Even more came apart during transport to the wedding. The seller did give me a partial refund, which I appreciated. They seemed to be a hit though with our guests! **Good rating** 


[Two Tier Veil from TheBridesStore $39.90](https://www.etsy.com/listing/176311539/bridal-veil-ambre-wedding-veil-with-the?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;ga_search_query=ambre) This shipped from Europe (not England like was listed) and took about 7 weeks to reach me. Luckily I was not in a hurry! It looked fine, but I ended up changing my mind on it and used another one. Even though it took forever to reach me, the seller did include some homemade jewelry in it (which we re-gifted to husband's aunt!) **Good rating**


[Ring bearer badge from ZCreateDesign $8](https://www.etsy.com/listing/212337856/ringer-bearer-gift-ring-security-badge?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;ga_search_query=ring) This was a bummer because the pin part on the back broke while we were putting it on the ring bearer, so totally a waste. **Bad rating**

Overpriced in my opinion as well for the quality. **So-so rating** 


[Custom Dog Dress and Leash from graciespawprints $49.95](https://www.etsy.com/listing/188715011/wedding-dog-dress-and-leash-set?ref=shop_home_active_8&amp;ga_search_query=wedding) This was a silly splurge but so fun! It fit our pup great and the seller was so sweet. **Excellent rating**

0,True,"Honestly the US is just too big in population terms for these programs to work. there is no way people are going to feel like a single community long enough to rally together to provide healthcare or tuition as european countries have done. 

it would need to be implemented by states and before that could happen, the state would need significantly more autonomy like more tax powers from federal government. 

european politics is very different. Many don't mind paying large percentage in tax because it's clear the country isn't falling round about them. Things are going to get very tough for american cities making the rich less inclined to pay if they're seeing less progress. 

I like how tuition works in england, where it is paid in a loan and you pay it back only when you're earning over 21k. So it functions as a graduate tax which is what wealth distribution is about. 'from each according to...'
There's still the issue that fees are always rising. it remains to be see whether the threshold for paying back will rise

Totally free, tax financed, programs as in not paid back other than when people reach higher tax brackets, are a bit of conundrum. I think it's a fallacy to say that the rich just disapprove and will flee. Tax flight is extremely rare. they can reroute for corporation tax but income is different. 

The rich have been easily convinced in many countries precisely because it's the rich who are inherently best placed to take advantage of public programs
The principle concern then becomes the fact that social public goods cease to enable redistribution/equality and are solely middle class appeasement (buying votes from better off middle income people).
I still think it pays off to have these 'free' or progressive tax financed programs like health and tuition if only because at the very least there is a middle class that exists to be appeased. It's surely better than the alternative = low/flat tax, minimum government input which widens the wealth disparity, shrink the middle class and makes social mobility/redistribution virtually impossible in all but iconic 'rags to riches' exceptions.

There's nothing forcing anyone to ship or trade anywhere.

&gt;and trade freely across the 28-nation group. In practice,
&gt;it gives individuals the right to earn a living, study or
&gt;retire in another EU country. It also gives consumers
&gt;a wider choice of items to buy at competitive prices,
&gt;allows them to enjoy greater protection when shopping
&gt;at home, abroad or online and makes it easier and

0,False,"We are a big club with a massive amount of money but we have been mismanaged alot lately, so we play a lot worse than we should considering our budget. So people dislike that we are shit but still manage to stay in but clubs like Freiburg, Paderborn etc who do really well considering with what they are working with have to go down. I can understand that and I agree to some degree that it might not be very fair but thats the business.


We also have been not that bad not too long ago and some fans held on that a bit too long and the expectations have always been high, not too long ago we were a top 6 club and thats what lots of fans expected. And even when we got worse lots of fans realized too late that expecting european competitions might not be realistic and we got a reputation of being arrogant. This reputation still (falsely) holds on even though most fans just want to not get relegated and wanted to place somewhere between 10th and 15th.



There are also some reasons which I honestly dont understand, we get a lot hate for having an investor, a lot more than any other club gets for it, even though we only sold like 9% of our club to investors and there are several clubs in the league who have sold a lot more. It seems to be completely okay for any club to do it but us.



On top of that people just like underdogs succeed and the big guys fall, there are several other clubs who can be compared to us. But most of the other ""big guys"" (Köln, Frankfurt, Hertha, Gladbach) who had a bad phase actually had to go down while we managed to stay up the third time now that it was really close and people are getting mad because of that. They also seem to have a problem with us being proud of being the only club to play every year of the history of the Bundesliga, we have a clock in our stadium that displays the amount of time we spent in the league and people want to see that clock gone.


The press also does a good job at making us the bad guy, when you listen to peoples reasoning why they hate us so much, a lot is just directly taken from stuff like Bild and most of it are half-truths or taken out of every context.

Offered them a best offer of £50 and they accepted. I purchased clear but the factory window has a green tint which they do along with smoked (good if your tinting your side windows)

The old window needs to be removed by removing the trim on the outside (this is then not needed as the new window has this built in) then peeling back the glued edge to reveal the zip. Undo the clamp on the zipper inside the car and unzip. Align the new window with clips on the sides and zip in, reuse the clamp or sew the zipper shut, they provide a double sided tape which is up to the job (I also purchased gorilla glue just in case) the edge of the roof tucks inside the built in trim and that's it, done!

I will be in Vienna from September to December so this will be a great time to experience change in seasons and especially the Christmas festivals!

1. Easiest way to travel between cities in Austria and outside of Austria. I think places outside of Austria I want to visit the most are  Murren, Munich, Prague, and maybe Amsterdam if I have time. Then inside Austria would be St. Anton, Innsbruck, and Salzburg. So if you have any tips for traveling or places you recommend that would be fantastic!

2. Nightlife in Vienna: Any bars or clubs that you would definitely recommend going to? 

3. How do you like WU?

4. Anything you would recommend to definitely do while I am here? As in what are your favorite things about Austria and Europe in general?

That is really it! I think the biggest thing I will need to get comfortable with will be travel. Such at euro rail pass vs. flying. Again, thank you a lot for taking the time to help me.

Not exactly. That was one thing that was a part of or a product of the failing Catholic monopoly on knowledge. Most likely the beginning had to do with refugees from the Byzantine Empire coming into north and west of Europe and bringing with them Aristotle and other Greek writings which had been forgotten, lost, or ignored by the Church. Also Copernicus had discovered and shared with some friends his heliocentric argument (a few years before ultra-conservative Christian Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses) and rumors spread throughout Europe.  The printing press was also a huge factor.  This is all from memory so forgive me for any errors.  

And no, the Scientific Revolution was not in response to Christianity. All of those revolutionaries that are held dear were Christian. However, they were still looking for a way to understand and explain what for them was God's creation.

I can just hear the tanks rumbling. The soldiers boots marching against the ground.

World War III has begun.

Over the years the Geneva Convention has been so heavily modified that all of the worlds lethal weapons have been taken and all that we are left with are paint balls and other paint related weaponry.

The paint if inhaled can cause lightheaded and dizzy feelings but nothing more severe than that.

But the world took the words ""paint warfare"" too literally, as they replaced all their cannon shells with huge hard shelled paint shell canisters that woulds blow paint over wide areas. The bombers replaced their napalm with paint, the soldiers replaced their bullets with little round plastic paintballs.

The world was churning a new world of warfare.

The rules were simple.

Once you got paint on you, you became a P.O.W.

You would be put in the opposing countries prison until the end of the war.

The worlds two main powers of Russia and the U.S.A. were deadset on crushing the other.

Russia slowly advanced through all of Europe, taking the weak light skinned soldiers of the West. The Europeans were all on vacation from the fighting and didn't even expect the cold hard Russians to come in paintballs blazing.

The U.S. had a less involved approach, sending paint bombers to ""napalm"" the enemy forces, bombing them with a bright yellow coat of paint.

Both countries bustled with energy as they all struggled to keep their paint supplies flowing as much as they needed.

In our hearts we want the best for the world, so these things became symbols for ""goodness"" in the heart of Americans. If someone burns a flag or doesn't stand to sing the national anthem, they are looked down upon. So, Americans overtly show their patriotism to show that they are ""good"" people, and have pride in our nation and want the best for the whole world. They are symbols of our national psyche in that we feel like the protectors of the entire world now. Also, one other point. Our flag is the only flag that has flown on the Moon, so we see it as a symbol of us looking out for the best interests of the entire Earth. That is why Americans display flags everywhere. We are just happy and proud, because in American minds ""we helped to liberate Europe, and we won the cold war against USSR, and we stepped foot on the moon"", so we look at it is a duty to all of us on the good Earth. It is with good intentions that we display our patriotism. I have three American flags flying in my front yard right now, and I could see half a dozen more up and down my street at this moment. I guess we feel very special, in that we have been given this ""duty"", as we see it. We pay for the defense of many other nations, and give much foreign aid more than any other country. Americans are the most charitable towards other countries, and we have created many technological advances that the whole world uses now. Many of our tech advances we have given away for free. So… I think Americans feel like they have sacrificed much and created much for the whole World. So it is just like a school sports team that is undefeated three years in a row. They want to wear ""their colors"". That is all that it is. ",0,AskReddit,False,1433203967,1,1436651665,,1,1433205101,,crsfx68,t3_3850xu,t5_2qh1i,,0,,t3_3850xu,ParkingLotRanger,t1_crsfx68

0,False,"James L. A. Webb's *Tropical Pioneers* actually gets into this a fair bit for the West African sudanic grasslands.  The short answer?  Endemic disease that would wipe them out.  It took quite some centuries to breed a horse resistant to parasites (eg., trypanosomiasis) and other organisms (later African Horse Sickness generally) that could see a natural increase.  The exceptions fell outside of tropical areas (such as the horse-riding cultures of the far south, who acquired horses primarily from Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries and became quite proficient, like the baSotho whom /u/huktonfonix points to).  

That said, horses were actually present south of the Sahara in significant numbers because of the trans-Saharan trade.  They formed the backbone of the feared Mali and then Songhay cavalry, as well as the cavalry of the Oyo Empire.  Arabian horses were highly prized, but as I mentioned above, they had a very short lifespan south of the desert and so needed to be replaced regularly (thus the interest in developing a relatively resistant breed, eventually realized close to the Niger bend, albeit a much less impressive horse).  In fact, the vectors for a variety of diseases are put off by high-contrast striped patterns, which potentially [explains the existence of the zebra's coat](http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/mystery-zebras-stripes-finally-solved).

0,False,"That was one of the best things about them in my opinion.

Saints don't make for good characters. The technomages had a dark atmosphere and mysterious origins, that's what made them great. Also they had clearly superior technology - as JMS alluded to several times during B5, ""magic"" is just science that we don't yet understand (like a flashlight in the civil war, or a rifle in medieval Europe). There had to be some explanation for why the technomages had such advanced technology and the First Ones were the only race on that level. 

It had to be the Shadows. Giving power directly wasn't the Vorlon's style. They manipulated evolution to produce telepaths out of necessity, but the Shadows wanted to plant seeds of chaos and hysteria as part of their overall goal of growth through evolution. What better way than to do that than creating each race's version of ""wizards"" and ""demons""?

It's a great throwback to JRR Tolkien's works, where the Maiar (Sauron, the five wizards, etc.) wielded great powers unthinkable to mortals. As a result of the influence this gives them, their entire world was plunged into tremendous wars that made each race stronger. Much like the wizards, the technomages knew that their ""magic"" was too disruptive to risk using to solve the problems of the lesser races, so they refused to wield it openly except in times of great need (in this case by leaving during the Shadow War).",0,babylon5,False,1433204489,3,1436651926,,3,False,,crsg7hq,t1_crs3awz,t5_2rhrd,,0,,t3_382ekl,lolzergrush,t1_crsg7hq

0,False,"A little late to this party, but I think I can offer some tips. I work for one of those RV rental establishments and do pretty much everything there from minor tech work to parts to customer demonstrations. Plus I used to drive 3x a year from NY to either Milwaukee, SLC, Colorado Springs or SF so there's that XD I always go into depth with the customers on how their trip went, so I've picked up a few things along the way.

Top three customer sentiments: 

Don't plan too many places in too little time-
Hitting SF, LA, Vegas, Grand Canyon, Yosemite and the Redwoods is something that our customers expect to do over the course of 20-25 days. They always say they wished they had spent twice the time at half as many places. Always figure three days at each major stop plus driving time.

Buy insurance-
You're driving a giant bus with a 4m height and blind spots bigger than Vermont. Wind, wet roads, and american drivers make it MUCH harder than it looks. Call your own auto insurance company and figure out EXACTLY what they cover in the US and Canada, and if there are restrictions for rental vehicles. Rental companies will sell you insurance, but there are limitations (I'll get into that later). The travel agencies that handle the booking will also sell you insurance, so ask a lot of questions and bring up hypotheticals. 

Buy a pre-paid american cheapo phone-
It just makes everything easier. Tracfone is popular! For smartphone internet, look into a one month contract with a CDMA US carrier. Verizon or sprint. GSM won't get signal in the nowheres, but sometimes cheaper. USB internet sticks are popular too. 

Call your credit card company and let them know you're spending a lot of money in the US. If you show up in the morning and your card gets declined, it's already past bank hours in Europe.

IN AMERICA 87 OCTANE IS THE BLACK ONE AND DIESEL IS THE GREEN ONE

As for the RV rental itself:
-Your home country driver's license is usually enough. Get the international endorsement just in case. You will need 1000-1500 USD major credit card limit for the kaution deposit. The holder of the credit card must be a licensed driver on the contract. You cannot drive an RV with airbrakes unless you have a special license. 

-For 5 total people, you should get a 32' C-class motorhome (7 ppl capacity) with the bunkbeds (check the rental company's site for floorplans) or any A-class motorhome (4-6 ppl capacity). Most A-class motorhomes will have a queen bed and two sofa/table/bed combo things. C-class RVs (and -new- A-class RVs) will have an extra bed at the front above the driver's area in addition to the queen. 

-The RV agent will give you a basic walk-through and an instructional video to watch while you wait. Find these videos on youtube and watch them a few times before you come over. We will show you how to drive automatic, use a steering-mounted shifter, how to empty the tanks, use the appliances, fill propane, check oil, etc. Get a handle on this before you even arrive in case the RV agent is new.

-If you're going through an agency, make sure you read EXACTLY what you've purchased, especially when it comes to packaged deals

-Take the hubcaps off before you leave and make sure the company knows you left them there deliberately to avoid being charged. (They WILL fall off) 

Camping and driving:

-Once you take hire of the RV, call and check your campsite reservations to double check the length limit. Most of yosemite and ""in-the-woods"" campsites have a 25-28 ft restriction on RVs

-AMERICANS DRIVE LIKE CRAP. Watch for passing on the right, no signaling, slow in the fast lane, and tailgating.

-Check your blindspots. After a few days of driving, you'll be used to it and it'll even be fun to drive, but the first couple days are nerve wracking. 

-No left lane or Diamond lane access. If it's not expressly forbidden in the state you're driving in, then still don't do it

-TOLLS! East coast states especially, but carry 20 bucks cash just in case, and use the right lanes at toll plazas. They are usually bigger and taller for trucks. 

-You do not have to stop at weigh stations unless the RV you rent is licensed as a commercial vehicle (It's probably not) If it is, they will tell you. 

-28l/100k. Let that sink in.

-Most campsites with ""hook-ups"" will have black tank dumping stations. If you pay to camp, it's free to dump. Otherwise expect a 30-50 USD fee. On the road, look for this sign: 

http://www.trumbullrecreation.com/i/Trumbull%20Signs/Sign_-_Dump_station__Fed_symbol.jpg

-You have two waste tanks, black and grey. Grey is for water from the shower and sinks. This fills up quickly, so avoid long showers. You only have 6ish US gallons for your water heater so that won't be hard. A good rule is ""a gallon a minute"" If you have a 20 gallon grey tank, you'll fill it up with 4 five-minute showers.

ON THE ROAD PROBLEMS- 

-The RV rental company should have an assistance line to call if your RV has problems. Call 911 if people are hurt or you cause property damage. 

-Most of the accidents I see at work are caused by ""out swing"". Look at a picture of an RV and you'll see how much rear over-hang there is behind the rear axle. Imagine pulling out of a parking stall with a car on each side. If you turn RIGHT before you start to pull out, everything behind the rear axle swings LEFT. 

-You are 4m tall. No fast-food drive-throughs

-TIRES!! This is a big one. CHECK the tires before you leave (all SIX of them) for tread and pressure. A U.S. coin can help in a pinch, but you want at least 5/16 tread depth. If you run over a screw, nail, glass, etc. you will be charged for a tire. It's not your fault, we know that. But it's not the rental company's fault either, so they're going to charge you. If a blowout was caused by inadequate tread, then you can have the rental company pay (But you checked this before you left, right?)

-If you hit another car GET A POLICE REPORT. It's the only official document on your side. If the accident was your fault, you will pay. If the accident wasn't your fault you probably still pay a little, but then show the receipts to the other driver's insurance company for compensation.

-TAKE ALL YOUR VALUABLES ALL THE TIME. It is so easy to break into an RV I can do it with my eyes closed in less than a minute. No alarms, no security features, and its probably a Ford so it'll be easy for them. 

-Always have at least 1/4 tank of gasoline. The generator on board will use the same fuel from the same tank and it wil shut off once you reach below 1/4 tank.

-WATCH FOR THE AWNING most RV rental insurance policies will explicitly state that the awning, undercarriage, and roof are NOT covered with the insurance. That means damages will be all out of pocket (600-1200 USD)

Borders:
-Expect to be searched at the international border. Have all your documents ready, and be able to tell them where you're going and for how long. You might need additional insurance. There usually isn't a problem, but always double check before you cross. 

-There are no state borders to worry about, just be aware of changing speed limits and speed traps

This is probably way too much info, but I've seen a lot of vacations ruined over very preventable or poorly handled mishaps. 

Now for the fun stuff! 

Cross country US highways are blue signs with 2 digits after an ""I"". Odd is north/south, Even is east/west. Ending in 5 means border to border, ending in a 0 means coast to coast (a couple exceptions, but a general rule) White signs are for smaller highways. 

From NY, take I-80 through Pennsylvania... much more scenic, and it avoids major cities. I-70 hits the cities, but is a toll road. If you want to take the northern route, head straight north up NY, hit Lake Placid, Montreal and maybe Quebec and head west through Ontario

From Florida, I-95 and US-1 parallel each other north. Atlanta is where you have to pick a general direction for chicago. Head north and check out SC and NC. Or head north west and hit the river. North Carolina is beautiful, Tennessee is nice too. From Chicago to TX, there's a few midwest cities that are cool stops. St Louis has the Arch, Memphis has amazing music culture, and Arkansas has cheap everything. Mississippi river cities tend to have great food and deep culture

If you have time, go to the Arches and Moab in southern Utah. By far the top pick destination from all my customers. From there, Salt Lake is beautiful, surprisingly international, and even more surprisingly liberal. Wyoming/Montana has yellowstone and Glacier parks. Colorado is beautiful, Vail and Denver are awesome cities. (Drink water at elevation!!!)



I don't reddit too much, but I figured I'd chime in here! Your trip will be awesome! I hope I didn't make it sound scary or dangerous!!

Dois processos revolucionários profundos que não tiveram a participação popular: Independência e Proclamação da República. No primeiro criou-se uma nação sui generis, onde nasceu uma monarquia para ter como súditos uma minoria apta a se enxergar no governante e uma maioria, mal tratada, que jamais veria esse governante como legítimo. 65 anos, amigão. É tempo pra burro. Poderia se dizer que ficamos 65 anos sem fazer política como deveríamos.

*Quão ligado é esse problema à formação do cidadão brasileiro?*

O problema do Brasil é a ausência de uma sociedade civil organizada. O fator principal que causou essa desunião é justamente o que eu apontei acima.

*Há formas democráticas viáveis de corrigirmos a política?*

Imagino que haja. Mas o tempo e o esforço necessário - e aqui me ligo a sua outra pergunta *Pode ser um processo muito longo?* - é muito, mais muito longo. Estamos falando da mais diversa nação do planeta. A quinta em termos populacionais. As transformações que se operaram num país como a Coréia do Sul, pela democracia, jamais se replicarão aqui.

*Uma reforma na estrutura dos poderes e no sistema eleitoral resolverá?*

Isso pode ser interessante, mas não é o principal. É preciso que se opere na sociedade uma mudança. A mudança não é institucional ou legal, ela tem de ocorrer no povo, no que ele crê ser cidadania, solidariedade, pluralismo. Três ideias que estão, inclusive, na Constituição, mas não possuem capilaridade com o povo. O povo brasileiro não sabe o que é cidadania (o pólo dos deveres) ou ser cidadão (o pólo dos direitos), não sabe o que é solidariedade nem tampouco pluralismo.

*Teríamos necessidade de mais uma revolução, ou um golpe?*

Uma mudança constitucional é o ideal, se inserindo num contexto em que acreditamos ser possível resolver nossos problemas pela via democrática. Mas por que uma mudança constitucional (mais uma)? Há um abismo entre a cabeça do cidadão brasileiro hoje, conectado e mais politizado, e a cabeça do brasileiro nos anos 1980. Agora imaginem isso daqui a 10, 15 anos. A sociedade construirá uma Constituição bem melhor.

*O atual modelo político de Brasil estaria fadado ao fracasso?*

De maneira nenhuma. Se, quando falamos de modelo político, significa presidencialismo, reeleição (até esses dias, eu sei, era possível), coligações partidárias, eu creio que não está fadado ao fracasso. O processo precisa é ser racionalizado. E isso depende da sociedade. Da cobrança.

Generally: decreases in consumption mean a decrease in economic activity. It means less incentive to build things which accelerates the downward spiral of the economy.

Focusing on the production aspects is a guessing game. Will our AI Overlords exist? Will we all learn how to dance for money on TV or are we all going to have jobs we can't even imagine yet?  Why guess at the unknowable when we know for a fact that less consumption == shittier economies and, eventually, a  death spiral! Economies are circular and need consumers and producers.

The interesting thing is here that it doesn't even have to be a local phenomena and it doesn't even really have to happen to see its effects. Look at the last recession. You basically took a huge percentage (GDP wise) out of the economy when the USA and the EU tanked and it nearly took down the global system. China, who has no population problem in this way, almost went belly-up.  When people stop buying, either because they are broke or they were never born, bad things happen.

Yes, it happens over a longer time period so we can adjust, that just means we get used to shittier standards of living without really noticing. Super great!

Finally, I am not advocating for everyone to have 8 kids so we can buy more. I am saying there is a delicate balance that we are currently stabilized around. Upsetting that on a less then 100 year timeframe is probably going to be fairly disruptive to productive economies.


tl;dr : We are all consumptive units in society and our shared standards of living are based on those consumptive units staying fairly constant. Depopulation screws that up for all of us. We need people so they can buy things that  we (or our Magical AI Machines) have a reason to make and sell so they can pay for our health benefits or the virtual matrix we live in or whatever.

The difference between West Ham going out immediately and winning all qualifying matches is exactly one full point for your national coefficient, which is more than your lead on Germany as of this season, to make an example. Making it out of the groups, instead, is not as big a deal as you might think: the five points bonus is offset by the (relatively easy) round of 32 teams get in the EL, provided they got third in the group. That tie nets four points if you win both legs, and the CL does not have the round of 32.

0,False,"&gt;As countries become more educated with more access to information, they have been trending rapidly toward irreligion.  

I have to disagree there. In reading the study you linked to, unaffiliated group is going to make modest gains by their projections, but this won't outpace population growth and the fertility rates of the religious and the overall population. I hesitate to fall into a colonial attitude to judge people (and their beliefs) based on education or lack thereof (it seems like an attitude such as, ""the well-financed and well-educated West is freeing itself from religion while the backwoods developing world still remains staunchly religious""). The reasons China has so many unaffiliated is very different than the reasons the unaffiliated are growing in North America. I think you're over-simplifying the issues. The religious switching that is going on is more complex than just a matter of having more education or access to information, although those can be some factors. Even though access to the internet and facebook is all on the rise globally, people are not leaving their religion in droves, and also not at rates seen in North America and Europe. Why is that? I just don't see the data to back that up.  

This stands out to me from the study:  
&gt;The religiously unaffiliated are heavily concentrated in relatively few countries. As of 2010, about 86% lived in the 10 countries with the largest unaffiliated populations.

0,False,"&gt; somewhat topical, have you tried Xenonauts?

I have. slightly rough around the edges but I really enjoyed it. Felt a lot more liberating to have more options and customisation when coming from EU.

&gt; I like the skills the classes add, and the skill tree.

Yeah I didn't mind them. A little over done perhaps in todays games which seemingly insist on having talent trees in everything they do, but it was something new to the genre and gave an extra layer to soldier progression beyond stat increases.

But as you mentioned, it pigeonholed soldiers into classes that you may not want them to be and restricted them to only 1 weapon type - which seemed a little basic. If they insist on talent trees then perhaps allow the player to pick the trees themselves and not have them weapon dependant either. For example say you get 'Offensive','Movement', Support', 'Defence/Endurance', and 'Psi' trees and you can pick and mix (interesting) talents from each tree to craft the soldiers you want - rather than ""You're a rocket dude, heres the rocket tree""  

There was something odd about the hit chances as well I remember. I'm not sure what it was but I swear I missed way too many 95% hit chances to be normal. I guess the attack itself was rolled and not the individual bullets you shot - felt cheap never the less. I mean, If im 2 meters away from an alien and shoot him with a shotgun, ok, I might miss pretty badly, but some spray should at least hit him, not every single pellet. ""adjusting sights"".  

I think they can make some comprimises. The example you used for instance regarding picking up weapons off the ground but without TUs. Then allow the soldier to pick up the weapon while he/she is still in the ""blue zone"" turn or allow to pick up while in yellow but not allow to fire the weapon until next turn.

Ideally for me it would be a game much closer to the originals but with a fantastic updated physics engine.

0,False,"&gt; You cannot spend and borrow your way out of a hole you spent and borrowed your way into!

This is exactly the kind of thinking the guy was talking about when he said naive. Firstly, the current sovereign debt crisis did not develop due to government overspending over time, it was a private sector crisis that left a huge whole in the economy. The government at the time decided the risk of letting the sector default on its debt was worse than the enormous expense of bailing them out, so regardless of how you feel about it, it was private sector accrued debt, that was passed on to the tax payer - which created the current high debt levels, not long term overspending. 

Secondly, austerity doesn't work. For all the 'common sense' talk cutting public spending has thus far only created more debt, though the deficit has decreased, it was still £76 Billion at the budget just prior to the election - so not even close to surplus let alone actually being able to pay off any significant portion the debt. Which, like Steve Keen explained in the video, wouldn't work anyway because long term surplus aren't politically sustainable. So this means that even this 'prudent' method is relying on the economy growing to reduce the debt burden, its not actually going to be 'paying off the debt'.

Which leads to the fact that austerity doesn't lead to economic growth - it intentionally depresses the economy, with the thinking being that being on a firmer financial footing is going to encourage people with money to invest to do so. But this is wishful thinking at best, because its never going to be reflected in the numbers - poor growth and thus an increasing debt-to-gdp ratio, and a culture of saving only encourages people with a lot of money to either save or invest in a country in which profit is more likely (where the economy is growing). 
The only way to offset this would be by increasing exports and running a trade surplus, but considering the manufacturing sector in the UK isn't great, and our main trading partner the European union is also firmly committed to austerity, and thus the pressure is on them to save as well, it is highly unlikely. So growth won't happen, meaning more austerity, to which people will only take so much of before they've had enough and vote for someone else.

There is also a moral argument here, like I said, this isn't a crisis that was 'spent and borrowed' in to, it was private debt, turned into public debt, which we are now asking the poorest to pay for through spending cuts and a refusal to raise taxes on those who can afford it. It is not about spending for the sake of it, its about spending in a way that actively promotes growth rather than passively hoping one day people with money are going to decide to invest with no reason to do so.",0,Scotland,False,1433210767,7,1436654491,,7,1433211103,,crsjoue,t1_crs9fe7,t5_2qkli,,0,,t3_383kx9,FallToParadise,t1_crsjoue

Over a billion watched the world cup final. There are world class leagues in multiple European countries, and proper leagues in upwards of 50 countries.

It literally changes how you see the world, English speakers don't have a bias towards objects, so we don't automatically think things of objects like Latin speakers do. A female object will always bring up nuances of female features present in the object, this is actually true.

NOT. if they think they have got all those homeless off the streets-they need to open their eyes because they will find them. people have such misconceptions about the homeless as werll, that they all want to be homeless and are lazy,alkies,druggies,mentally ill.  NOPE. Yes, many are one or more of the above,but i know jsut as many people that have those issues who are gainfully employed and have homes and that is the ONLY difference! My Son and i have been homeless going on 5 years now and were struggling for many years before that happened. Neither of us drinks,does drugs,smokes no mental illness,zero criminal record. And I have a very high I.Q. and am the hardest working person you are ever going to meet. homelessness can happen at any time to ANYONE, so people really need to start changing their attitudes as it CAN happen to YOU. This economy is awful and getting worse-not better.be LUCKY if you have a job/home/car and or family/friends that can help you. All people we have met here in houston want to do is shove us into a shelter,and that is NOT the solution! Not even CLOSE! They just do not want to feel guilty by not helping and want us to ""disappear"",and shoving the homeless into shelters is their ignorant solution. Shelters are HORRIBLE. if you have never had to spend even one night in one-you would run screaming from them and never want to go back.They all need to be shut down but only AFTER,the REAL solution has spread and taken hold. individuals-not the Government,not organizations, are building tiny homes on wheels for the homeless. And that is a PERMANENT and intelligent solution. you can do a search on Google for Tiny Homes for the homeless and you will get a lot of information on how you can help.
There are also some awesome temporary soultions. DDonating bicycles (with racks to carry stuff/baskets,or even bike trailers is a HUGE thing to give a homeless person so they can get around and not have to carry (heavy0 stuff around everywhere. people do not think about a lot of things homeless people go through on a daily basis but me personally-aside from working hard jobs most of my life and growing up in the country doing very hard work,carrying very heavy stuff has caused me to have permanent muscle injuries limiting me even more from working certain jobs. :-( I had my own businesses before this happened. Divorce was a very heavy contributing factor. England and other European countries are far advanced in building awesome things to help homeless-bicycle campers are the most awesome idea I have seen. Lightweight campers that can be folded down to tow easily and folded out to expand to a size big enough for sleeping/sitting. There is a fiberglass one I saw that is so awesome but so high priced and only available in Denmark I believe-not the U.S. o the Engineer asking,this would be awesome if it could be made cheaper here in the U.S. and of course AVAILABLE here. They would obviously have to be given to the homeless since hardly any could afford to buy one, or a program could be set up for funding or for people to donate money to purchase them to give. Here it is:http://www.livinginashoebox.com/this-foldable-bicycle-camper-lets-you-live-comfortable-on-the-road/
There are lots of other cool bicycle campers all over the interent,but I think the solid/fiberglass is the best as it is lightweight and unlike a tent,offers a lot more protection than a tent or other soft material. There are others online that offer PLANS for sale to build them also.
We have been very disappointed in Houston as far anyone really seeming to care about the homeless at all.Our situation especially. i guess they see two people who look healthy (I do have a couple health issues,and unfortunately,the longer you are on the street,the more it affects your health.) so they figure we can help ourselves. I have dental issues and I am sure my age and condition of my teeth are going against me heavily as far as getting work /being hired and I have been self-employed most of my life as a musician/singer/artist,so not many other skills and with my injuries,difficult. i am sure there are those who judge,thinking because I have bad teeth -drugs-automatically. NOPE. it is a condition that my Mother also had referred to as dry mouth. Saliva is needed to protect the teeth from decaying and we just do not have all that much so the teeth deteriorate quickly and with no work/insurance,and no real help,cannot get them taken care of.
People think it is easy-they beed to try and see how long they could take being out ont he street inthe elements day and night-Summer and Winter,with no work/money,trying to find a palce to go,trying to get anywhere without having a stable place to live. it is impossible. That is why the tiny homes for the homeless is such an awesome idea. nobody wants to hire homeless people. i know by experience. I have lsot so many opportunities it is ridiculous due to being homeless and being forced usualy to disclose that information to the other party or parties involved. bomm. The last you hear from them. just lsot thousands of dollars worth of work painting murals in a ncie church because they found out i was homeless. A CHURCH. You heard right. it was the opportunity i needed to move to a different area of town and to be able to get inside and get back on our feet. So,the next time you ask a homeless person "" Why don't you get a job???""..DON""T. Most have tried, and been judged just like i have. Once homeless people have a stable place to live-AN ADDRESS,everything CHANGES. Shelters are NOT the answer-not even close. Bad advice to give anyone is to tell them to go to a shelter. IF you can even get in. Here in Houston-it is too big and too many people needing help. There is domestic violence in them and they are like prisons for the msot part. youa re nOT free to come and go as you please,many youc nanot evne have a PHONE or interent/computer-they totally control everything you do. How would you like that? NO homeless people i know want to stay in a shelter. NONE. including me and my son. ESPECIALLY us, as we have NO issues, that many have,the drugs,alcohol,mental illness,criminal history,etc,so we are unlike many though there are getting to be more and more like us out there every day. it could be your Mother,sister,daughter,brother,son,Father-friends-anyone. The majority of money earmarked for the homeless is NOT going to help the homeless,so please do not give money to these organizations. if you have the ability, set up a fund or get a group of family/friends together to help homeless people you see that need help,. Donate BICYCLES! With a good lock, a rack/basket/trailer,and you will be helping tremendously! I could say so much more, and may post again later but need to go for now. You can message me with any questions you have or if you can help in any way. Anything would be appreciated.

See this article, which explains WHY I don't fit in at work (which consists of a lot of upper class rich pseudo intellectuals) or at most elite law firms. I think I really need to target law firms where I will fit in more… i.e. in more rural, lower-class areas if at all possible (lawyers tend to be rich/come from upper class so this will still be tough)…

0,False,"I do understand why you have drawn the conclusion you have, but this article is far from giving any kind of final word on the subject. In fact it does a very poor job of even explaining what is actually detailed in the release of the game. It also comes from a third party source, so its reliability is a bit questionable.

Here is the final word on the release of the game from Evolution themselves. 

http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2014/04/30/driveclub-update-evolution-studios-2/

two things of note:

The date of this article was April of 2014. Several months before release after the initial delay. 

""I’d also like to confirm that the PS Plus Edition of the game will be available on the same day as the full release. Offering a selection of cars and tracks from the complete version, we think it’s the perfect way for those new to the genre to get an idea of what the full DRIVECLUB experience is all about. Look out for more details on the PS Plus Edition very soon.""

That is the direct quote from the studio themselves. Prior to this article Evolution never once mentions a PS+ version separate from the main game. I did a very detailed search and combed every article, interview, or quote from Evolution studios I could find to make sure.  

As far back as the reveal trailer at E3 2013 prior to the launch of the PS4 Evolution never once mentions that the game will be free in any capacity. PS+, or otherwise. The article I linked is the very first mention of the subject from Evolution themselves.

Now what SONY had to say about it may, or may not be different, but none of the information I could find on the subject suggests that there was ever an official announcement given that the full game would be free. In fact there are articles that state the contrary. Every bit of rumor or info I could find prior to the launch of the PS4 all state that there would be a PS+ version AND a full version of the game. (according to SONY)

If they ever intended the PS+ version to be the full game they would not have had any reason to release 2 versions of the game. Yet even back in 2013 they (SONY) always mentioned a PS+ version and the full retail version as separate items.  

Many people on this sub keep using the word ""Promise"" to describe what they feel they were owed in a PS+ version. IE: ""I was promised a PS+ version""

I am starting to wonder if people actually know what the word promise means, because at no point in the history of DriveClubs media has the word promise been used in any capacity as to what people should expect.

No one at Evolution, or SONY ever gave any kind of a pinky swear promise, or otherwise that they would deliver a free, full PS+ version of the game. I cannot tell you where that rumor started, but there is nothing fact based to it. It simply never happened.

All of that aside I do fully understand that Evolution themselves stated there would be a PS+ version. We all know the circumstances behind the game not getting its PS+ version yet, but if they say its still coming I am going to err on the side of caution and assume that it is for sure coming. I say that with confidence for 2 reasons. 

First they created ""Starting Line"" which is the demo pack that was specifically made for the PS+ version and it is currently available and active in the game.

The second reason is that the PS+ version already exists. It was briefly available and was then pulled immediately when the game launched due to server errors. I bought the full game at launch and even though I could not play online at that point I still had the option in game of touring the PS+ version if only very briefly. 

I get while people are upset, and I can sympathize with some of the complaints, because early on I had some of the same complaints myself. 

What I can tell you now is that the game has grown by leaps and bounds since launch. EVO has done nothing, but make stellar improvements to the game since its disastrous launch. The game it currently is now cannot even be compared to what it was at launch, because it is far superior now in every way. 

People will still hold a grudge, because of stuborn, stupid willfulness. That cannot be helped, but EVO has more than made up for any early failings in my eyes.

Immortal doesn't mean you can't be tied up and put in a cage.

And in the 2500 years you spend trying to build these weapons who's to say none of the more war-like native tribes are going to steal these weapons from you and use them to form their own super-nation to challenge yours?  Furthermore, what's to stop these native tribes from selling off some of these weapons to European traders thus arming your very enemies.

I think it'd be far easier to become a world power by blending in with some Germanic barbarian tribe and then selling your service as a warrior to Rome in exchange for a piece of land and a title.  Once you have that you wait for the fall of Rome and set yourself up a nice little kingdom.

I don't know how Tokyo is; probably still somewhat pricey, but Osaka and Kyoto were very cheap when I was there. Most restaurant meals did not cost over 10 dollars and tended to be all you can eat. You could also get all you can drink for 2 hours for around 15 dollars. All these were decent establishments. I honestly ended up returning home with extra yen because I couldn't spend it all, and I did a fair amount of clothing shopping (which was also pretty cheap).

Again, Tokyo is probably going to be a bit pricier then that, but Osaka and Kyoto are solid destinations anyways.
I really liked the former, and if you're into the entire historical stuff Kyoto is good, or so I hear. I'm more a big city guy.

L' eccessiva spesa pubblica, se lasciata a sè stessa, è un problema che si risolve da solo in una situazione normale. La domanda è: ma perchè quella greca non è una situazione normale? Perchè le banche (tedesche e non solo) hanno continuato a iniettare capitale in un' economia come quella greca che è chiaramente incapace di far fronte ai debiti contratti nel caso in cui, come adesso, questi debiti vengano reclamati? Possiamo stare qua ad argomentare che non lo si sapeva eh, ma lo sapevano tutti ma proprio tutti - tranne i contribuenti, che magari lo potevano anche sospettare ma che più di tanto non si ponevano il problema.

Mentre il governo greco (non i *greci*, ci tengo a sottolineare) ingrassava le sue clientele con i soldi tedeschi e, per evitare problemi alle urne, girava il contentino ai votanti, le banche tedesche hanno estratto prima gli interessi, poi soldi statali provenienti dai loro stessi contribuenti - ricordo qui che il ""salvataggio"" greco, le LTROs e il QE sono stati fatti a spese del contribuente europeo, e sono tutti soldi che in un modo o nell' altro finiscono nuovamente alle banche - vista la situazione attuale europea di bassissimo (se non negativo) interesse, continuato nonostante il QE (che QE non è, ma è un argomento per un altro post).

Il parallelo con la situazione italiana è spaventoso. Nessuno, se non qualche ""estremista"", si sta per ora ponendo il problema.

L' austerità è sì una conseguenza, non una causa, ma fa parte del piano a lungo termine dei banksters che governano l' europa - è la leva con cui stanno delegittimando e svuotando i governi nazionali. Se la quantità di capitale destinata a LTRO e QE fosse stata iniettata nell' economia reale invevce che girata alle banche tutti i problemi di tutti gli stati europei in sofferenza sarebbero stati risolti. 3 o 4 volte. Il problema è puramente politico, non tecnico, e la continua insistenza sul fatto tecnico non è che un modo per evitare la responsabilità politica dei fatti (non si può fare niente, ""c'è la crisi""™).

Chi ci rimette in tutta questa storia è chi si sveglia la mattina a andare a lavorare (Greco, Tedesco, o Italiano) e chi ci guadagna sono i soliti noti.

0,False,"&gt; Today I don't see anything of the sort in prisons and criminal justice. 

Have you ever been inside a prison? (I'm asking to get an idea of your actual familiarity with prisons, not just what you see in the media.)

This definitely exists in European prisons and I'd be surprised if it didn't exist at all in the US. The problem is that prisons are severely underfunded at all times so you simply can't do this properly. Prisons are underfunded because the public simply doesn't care or doesn't want to think about it, which gives politicians leeway in how and where they cut funding. On top of that, prisoners often lose their voting rights (either for the duration of their stay or for a longer time) which creates even less political will to fix things. (Source: I studied criminology. We covered this extensively.)

My hope for prisons in the future is to focus more on rehabilitation (think Scandinavian model) and less on punishment for most prisoners. Prisoners should learn the right skills to live a lawful life an unlearn the habits that lead to crime. I also hope that things like UBI or less scarcity will lead to fewer low-level crimes (white collar crime doesn't get punished anyway and if it does it's not prison).

&gt;Sure, lets assume local identity. Why do you think a English guy should have first dibs on a council house over a clearly more deserving family of 21 British Asians? Or indeed a Scotsman.

Many Britons ARE Foreign Nationals. They have a nationality into which an English person was not included when their parents or grandparent were included into Britishness.  I do not consider any such foreign national to be English, Irish, Welsh or Scottish.   Nor do I accept anyone who has simply renounced dual citizenship to be. Nor do I accept anyone who, after enough generations have passed to lose them granny-ing in to the society they or their relatives came from to.  In the last example all the person would be is a resident of Britain who is no longer a foreign national.  THEN the person could apply to become a British national.  The main requirement should be that he treats all foreign nationals as subjects of UK law and not as native Britons.

0,False,"Is the correct answer. I did a Computer Science PhD in Western Europe, and I must have read somewhere in the high hundreds to low thousands of papers. I've read papers from all over the world, but never one that came from a Serbian university/institution. Not to say there weren't any Serbian authors, just none from a Serbian institution.

Now, I've actually met a few programmers over here, most if not all were good, and interestingly, while many back in 'Western' Europe would have taken a few classes in ML, almost all of the programmers i've met here don't even know of the basic methods. I've met one guy who is very smart, and back home would probably be on a PhD programme, but he was just trying to get started in learning some of the 101 material in his own time.

While the work required to get a PhD varies between groups and between universities in the 'West', i'm not sure what professional guidelines are required on average here. I've met a few PhDs, and their lack of English and knowledge of basic terminology as relates to Academia and academic positions does make me doubt they had a requirement to publish internationally, though that's clearly not conclusive in anyway.

Now, here are some guesses and general observations:

* I don't think there is much funding for research and the equipment needed in many fields, indicating they would most likely do more theoretical work than otherwise, out of necessity.

* Yet, many of those in position to do theoretical work, such as math students at uni,  have been/are offered the opportunity to switch to a computer science track so they can get work.

* If you have a commercialisable skill within STEM, you're more likely to leave academia to make money instead of following a research career. E.g., programmers can make good money here, compared to the national average, so are naturally financially enticed to do so instead of pursuing research. 

* Anecdotally, i've heard of more people pursing PhDs in fields where they can't get work. Given the high unemployment rate here, the trend seems to be the continuation of studies in fields where there is low demand for work, which is the opposite of how funding works in the USA or Western Europe. Medicine is slightly different here, but again, the best practitioners of medicine aren't the ones i've heard of going into a research career. In fact, those doing research who have to do stints on a ward/operating theatre tend to be the worst at the actual practise of medicine. Again, this is anecdotal. Maybe i'm being unfair here though, as superficially this could be said of computer scientists and their skills at programming, but in my personal experience, the best programmers during uni went on to research. The rest, from bad to average, went on to work as programmers. That's the opposite here in Serbia.

* Corruption and unprofessional behaviour permeates Serbian society. I've heard of people in certain fields getting on to research tracks due to nepotism, then leveraging their 'expert status' for paid work, meaning they spend little to no time doing research.

* Naturally, people who are interested in having a genuine research career are more likely to try and do it abroad if they can.

* Research in medicine seems to be different, but again seems to be based of relationships, and motivated by a desire for social status. Being motivated by social status is something i've seen everywhere, but it's a definitely a bigger factor here. But here, doctors seem to have a leg up over other fields wrt research, as they stay abreast, when it suits them, of international/European/EU guidelines, meaning their English is far better than most, so they do publish semi-internationally. 

So, this doesn't really answer your question, and my intention isn't to piss off any locals on here, but these are my general observations.

Liverpool will be desperate this window, and teams will know it. If they get Benteke, they'll overspend for him.

0,False,"Yes, and the situation is already changing - and has been changing for some time.

There is still huge opposition among the political classes to discussing immigration; having championed it for so long it is very hard not to look foolish when changing sides. In the UK the Labour party - having lost their election with Brown at the helm - tried then to portray itself as 'having been against immigration' and looked absolutely ridiculous. In the UK the second most popular party is now a nationally-focussed (UKIP) party which openly claims to put national interests first. This - along with the election of the SNP, another nationally focussed party - represents a complete upheaval in UK politics, it would be similar in the USA to the Democratic party winning ten states and a 15 year old party winning the rest of their share.

In France, Marine Le Pen's NF continues to take huge numbers of votes, despite what some have said here the party is stronger under her than under Jean-Marie who many suspected was starting to flake out; Europe is not ready to elect someone who channels Ben Garrison.

Most other European countries are going a similar way - and of course there was out and out race war ('Ethnic Cleansing') in the Balkans not so many years ago.

Europe is also still a far far _far_ whiter place than any part of the USA, I don't think one European state is more 'black/colored' as a percentage of the population than any USA state.

There are also a lot of problems with hate speech laws - even if what you say doesn't violate them, there are plenty of charity groups that will doggedly follow around 'extremists' reporting every single thing they say on twitter etc to the police. If you're controversial and attract attention you can be in court for 'hate speech' defending yourself multiple times per year.

There is another problem which is similar to that in the USA, while the Republican party voters are strongly against illegal immigration - moreso than Democrats - the Republican party itself is supported by business interests that have no real interest in reducing the availaiblity of illegal labour.

In Europe - which does not have anywhere near the same levels of organic population growth as the USA - this equates to politicians needing immigration to prop up national health programs and state pensions, which of course are predicated on unending pyramidal population growth. Unlike in the USA there is no voter opposition to those schemes - and neither should there be, to be honest, as everyone benefits equally - there's only significant opposition to actual welfare handouts.

So European politicians need to encourage immigration for financial reasons - similar to Australia - but of course have gone about it all wrong. In the UK at least the immigration 'need' is being filled almost entirely by Poles and other Eastern European citizens, however the immigration statistics don't count those at all - European citizens are literally not counted into or out of the country - so the system still sees that 'need' for counted immigrants...",0,CoonTown,False,1433237896,3,1436661930,,3,False,,crstkeo,t3_3849fu,t5_351zk,,0,,t3_3849fu,ctalt1,t1_crstkeo

0,False,"&gt;will this so-called recovery carry on if oil prices increase or the Euro regains strength?

I don't foresee any of those things happening any time soon. Fracking is pretty much a thing now and the TTIP would really benefit from a dollar-euro parity. Maybe down the road the ECB could decide to raise the price of the euro, but things would have to change a lot in the Southern and Eastern economies.

Anyway, it's safe to say that many new companies won't be competitive enough to adapt to a stronger euro when, and if, the time comes... so another reason to keep the euro at a low price for the short/mid term.

&gt;Is there a connection between the government policies and this recovery?

Draghi saved Spain (and the EU) in 2012. Sounds silly but it is what it is. Any sign of recovery we're seeing now happens because of that speech of his three years ago telling everybody that the ECB would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And that, luckily for us, included keeping Spain afloat. 

Of course it helps the PP, for good or bad, is not Syriza and that keeps risk-averse investors quite happy; and that Rajoy (and Zapatero before him) has been quite accommodating to EU institutions, but other than that... no, Rajoy wasn't exactly all that relevant: in fact our debt has never been higher, the taxes have gotten out of hand and the state hasn't cut its spending all that much.

The Northern European countries practise their governance in relative peace, there are no pressures on them.

Israel, on the other hand, practices a form of democracy/socialism (with decent freedoms) under threat of national destruction. They have found the key to responding quickly to crises under a democratic system (rather than the drawn-out BS of plain vanilla democracy). We must learn their secret.

0,False,"London is already a thoroughly unpleasant place to live for the local population because they can't even dream of owning a house before they're 40, and that's if they're good savers and planners. Even if you're a young and recent graduate of the best universities in London and have a good job in a growing service sector, you're looking at a 10-15 year period of waiting if you want to buy a house.

What is a truly unpleasant level of population density? I'm genuinely curious. The infrastructure has been underdeveloped in London for years because the city planners have resisted against allowing more housing and a higher density. It's because of their stubbornness and restrictive policies that house prices have shot through the roof and vast swathes of the populace will never own a house in London.

Their policies have also created a cycle of foreign investors buying homes in London because prices rise, so more foreign investors buy in, which causes prices to rise, which leads to more foreign investors to buy in. Are the London city planners hoping that foreigners will all become poor? Or will they build more supply to satisfy demand so that prices won't rise as much and this cycle isn't continually perpetuated?

Edit: the financial market and the housing market are completely different. The housing market's problems in London are caused by poor planning and a stubbornness against gentrification, which ironically has driven a lot of the poor out of the city because they can't even afford the rents.

Until there are tens and tens of 300m tall buildings in Kensington, the city planners are far too restrictive in allowing housing development.

The stubbornness of the city planners is even more frustrating because in a relatively small country, you can only build upwards. The planners are very restrictive in allowing tall buildings to develop in London, which goes against common sense. I mean, there's a reason Canary Wharf is one of the most productive places in Europe and that's because tall buildings are clustered together, allowing clusters of educated and skilled service sector workers to live and work there.

0,False,"More than 1,000 new apprentices have been taken on so far this year - almost double the number of new starts for the same period in 2013.

The recovering economy is opening doors for new recruitment into training in areas of trade, such as construction, electrical, engineering and motor.

And plans are also advanced for an expansion of the apprenticeship model - a combination of paid work and in-college study - to a raft of new sectors.

Opportunities for traditional apprenticeships collapsed in parallel with the 2008 economic crash, which brought a sudden halt to years of frenzied building activity, while car sales plunged.

At the height of the boom - in each of the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 - there were about 29,000 apprentices in Ireland, at different stages in their training. As the harsh winds of change swept in, the number of apprentices fell to about 23,000 in 2008, and then dive-bombed to 15,000 in 2009.

Such was the speed and severity of the crash that many apprentices lost their job and special arrangements had to be made to enable them to finish their training, if they hadn't already emigrated.

As the recession dragged on, apprentice numbers hit a low of 5,711 in 2013, before starting to climb again in 2014, when there were 6,913 registered.

The growth is gathering pace and, at the most recent count, there were about 7,400, including more than 1,000 new registrations since January, according to latest figures from SOLAS, the State agency for further education and training.

The figure is up 80pc on the 556 starts in January-April 2013, and a 20pc increase from 844 for the same four months last year.

The strength of the recovery is underlined in recent announcements by major companies such as the ESB, Irish Rail, Gas Networks and Nissan Ireland about apprenticeship recruitment programmes over the next few years.

The Office of Public works, whose activities include the protection and conservation of national monuments, has also advertised for apprentices in stonecutting/stonemasonry.

There is a growing recognition that Ireland needs to develop the apprenticeship sector, in the interests both of offering diversity of choice to school-leavers, while also meeting the needs of employers and society.

Diverse

While Ireland leads the way in Europe for the proportion of young people with third-level qualifications, the statistics mask the lack of options for school-leavers, and others, to pursue which don't have a degree as the goal.

Earlier this year, a newly appointed Apprenticeship Council called on employers, industry organisations and education and training bodies to come up with new apprenticeship ideas.

As many as 86 different proposals have emerged in sectors as diverse as financial services, arts, craft and media, information technology, agriculture, natural resources, sales and marketing, tourism and sport, transport and administration.

These are being evaluated and the council will issue recommendations to Education Minister Jan O'Sullivan by the end of June.

&gt;

&gt;The term __foo fighter__ was used by [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) [aircraft pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot) in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) to describe various [UFOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object) or mysterious aerial [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena) seen in the skies over both the [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations) and [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Theater_of_Operations) theaters of operations.

&gt;Though ""foo fighter"" initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the U.S. [415th Night Fighter Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/415th_Night_Fighter_Squadron), the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period.  Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, witnesses often assumed that the foo fighters were secret weapons employed by the enemy.

&gt;The [Robertson Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Panel) explored possible explanations, for instance that they were [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic) phenomena similar to [St. Elmo's fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire), [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals.

&gt;

&gt;__HMS *Lightning*__ was a [torpedo boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_boat), built by [John Thornycroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I._Thornycroft_%26_Company) at Church Wharf in [Chiswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiswick) for the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy), which entered service in 1876 and was the first seagoing vessel to be armed with self-propelled [Whitehead torpedoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whitehead). She was later renamed *Torpedo Boat No. 1*.

&gt;As originally built, *Lightning* had two drop collars to launch torpedoes; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. She carried also two reload torpedoes amidships.

&gt;The *Lightning* spent her life as a tender to the torpedo school [HMS *Vernon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Vernon_(shore_establishment\)) at Portsmouth and was used for some experiments. She was broken up in 1896.

The legislation was further extended by further directives to include cross border transit of freight.

&gt;The subsequent directives 2001/12/EC, 2001/13/EC and 2001/14/EC which built upon the initial legislation are collectively known as the __First Railway Package__.  In September 2010 the process of merging the directives into a single piece of legislation was begun; with the addition of modifications to strengthen the regulatory framework.  The [Second Railway Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Railway_Package) and the [Third Railway Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Railway_Package) aimed to push integration further.

People have an amazingly stilted grasp of how the NHS performs in terms of efficiency and economy, and often remark about how much better healthcare is in other European countries. In reality, as with everything in life, it's a case of money.

For reference, Germany is at 11.3%, France is at 11.7% and the US is at 17.1%.

These are *huge* differences - for instance, if we matched German spending as a proportion of GDP, that's an addition 2.2% - £38 Billion. I have no strong objection to this idea, but I suspect the British Public aren't prepared to pay Continental levels of taxation in exchange for Continental style public services. Look at the list, and try to find any country with a *lower* %GDP spend on healthcare that you think is a model we should emulate.

É por isso que eu disse, inclusive, que essa parte é fundamental para o pleno desenvolvimento da Economia, enquanto disciplina. Acontece que tomar emprestado o método científico, ainda que seja o melhor que se possa fazer nesse tipo de situação, não resolve o problema de fundo epistemológico ao qual eu me referia. 

Eu acho que as proposições econômicas, assim como as demais que eu chamo de não-científicas, ou ""filosóficas"", tem uma série limitação na sua testabilidade. Não acredito que isso tenha a ver com o grau de complexidade dos problemas que elas abordam, como outros colegas chegaram a sugerir, mas sim com a forma como elas se relacionam com a realidade. 

No caso da Economia, eu não acredito que as proposições possam ser consideradas verdadeiras por correspondência com a realidade (outro pressuposto dessa minha visão, cabe ressaltar, é a existência de uma teoria pluralista e funcional da verdade, nos moldes daquela proposta por [Michael P. Lynch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynch_%28philosopher%29)). Por consequência, o uso do método científico fica absolutamente comprometido, uma vez que nos deparamos frequentemente com variáveis inverificáveis, ou variáveis que não podem ser isoladas, por exemplo, para remeter ao início da nossa conversa aqui. 

Guardadas as devidas proporções, eu diria que essa é a mesma dificuldade que se vê, por exemplo, no campo da Ética. Grosso modo, é possível dizer, uma vez assumido um determinado conjunto de proposições como ponto de partida, que a verdade dessas proposições depende muito mais da sua relação com esse conjunto de princípios (coerência) do que com a realidade em si mesma (correspondência). A matemática pura e as demais ciências formais também enfrentam situação parecida, se for ver. Por isso, em sentido estrito, também não costuma-se dizer que elas sejam ciências. 

Pelo que eu presumi do seu último comentário, eu acho que você estava esperando uma resposta que fosse esclarecer qual método seria o mais correto, na minha opinião, para utilizar na tentativa de prever o PIB brasileiro para o ano de 2015, por exemplo. Bom, da mesma forma que você não se interessa muito pelo mérito da área, eu também não me interesso muito pelo estudo dos modelos, então não saberia ajudar nesse ponto, para além do que eu já acrescentei aqui nessa discussão. 

O que me incomoda não é o método que foi utilizado para fazer esse cálculo, essa previsão. Até porque, como disse, não acho que haja outro melhor, que não o método científico (sem entrar no mérito específico do modelo que foi utilizado pela equipe econômica do governo nesse caso). O que me incomoda é os economistas acreditarem que essa vertente, mais empírica, que se apoia no método científico para tentar testar as teorias econômicas, seja suficiente para transformar as teorias econômicas em teorias científicas. No fundo, eu acho que é esse comportamento que dá origem a comentários como o do /u/waspbr, que se referiu à Economia como pseudo-ciência. E é nesse sentido que eu disse que ela se envergonha, porque ela não é uma ciência. E isso não deveria ser um problema, porque isso não faz da Economia uma disciplina menor - a não ser que ela negligencie essa constatação. 

Em última análise, talvez, o que eu quero dizer é que, à parte da discussão dos diferentes modelos que podem ser aplicados para prever os resultados do PIB de um País, por exemplo, a Economia deveria valorizar mais o método filosófico (ou talvez político fosse mais apropriado nesse caso) e reconhecer as limitações epistemológicas inerentes à sua prática. Isso me faz lembrar a [pergunta](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/3386353/The-Queen-asks-why-no-one-saw-the-credit-crunch-coming.html) feita pela Rainha aos economistas da London School of Economics, quando do auge da crise financeira de 2008. Ao serem questionados por que não foram capazes de prever a crise, responderam a ela que a crise não foi prevista porque era imprevisível. Acho que esse [artigo](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) do Paul Krugman para o NYT sumariza bem o meu ponto. Para finalizar, destaco esse trecho em particular: 

&gt;As I see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth. Until the Great Depression, most economists clung to a vision of capitalism as a perfect or nearly perfect system. That vision wasn’t sustainable in the face of mass unemployment, but as memories of the Depression faded, economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets, this time gussied up with fancy equations. The renewed romance with the idealized market was, to be sure, partly a response to shifting political winds, partly a response to financial incentives. But while sabbaticals at the Hoover Institution and job opportunities on Wall Street are nothing to sneeze at, the central cause of the profession’s failure was the desire for an all-encompassing, intellectually elegant approach that also gave economists a chance to show off their mathematical prowess.

&gt;Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the imperfections of markets — especially financial markets — that can cause the economy’s operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to the dangers created when regulators don’t believe in regulation.

&gt;It’s much harder to say where the economics profession goes from here. But what’s almost certain is that economists will have to learn to live with messiness. That is, they will have to acknowledge the importance of irrational and often unpredictable behavior, face up to the often idiosyncratic imperfections of markets and accept that an elegant economic “theory of everything” is a long way off. In practical terms, this will translate into more cautious policy advice — and a reduced willingness to dismantle economic safeguards in the faith that markets will solve all problems.

So I was playing Italy. Allied to Germany and the dying Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary declared war on me for the reconquest of Istria. Germany joined the war. It did not start as a great war, however. Austria launched a massive offensive into Germany, shattering their scattered forces.

&amp;nbsp; 

By the end of the year, the Austrians were at the gates of Berlin. This was mostly due to Germany's slow and late mobilization, which they did not do until several months into the war. When they did finally mobilize, it was slow and costly, taking almost 6 months to complete. When the Germans finally did finish their mobilization however, they became a war machine. They won overwhelming victories in Munich and Nuremberg, halting the Austrian invasion and securing Berlin from foreign hands.

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ 

The Germans then went on to wipe out almost the entire Austrian Army in the Northern Front. They proceeded to sweep through Bohemia and Moravia, then taking Bratislava, Krakow, and Lvov in a matter of months. What was almost certain defeat for the Germans became a resounding victory.

&amp;nbsp; 

Meanwhile, the front in Italy was much slower paced. The Austrians launched an offensive into Istria, which was quickly repelled. Afterwards, the front descended quickly into trench warfare. In the nearby town of Klagenfurt, the two nations saw a total of four different battles occurring all at separate times, in the same year. After the Austrian army was worn out through the use of Gas Attacks, the Italians launched a large offensive into Austria, and punched a hole in Austrian lines, allowing them to capture Vienna in a matter of months.

(◕‿◕✿) 

The war was not over, however. With the announcement by the King of Italy, of their intentions to completely destroy and dismantle the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Russians entered the war. They believed it was better to have a weak state in near collapse to be in control of the Balkans, if not themselves. Much less had they wanted a Balkans that fell under Italian influence.

&amp;nbsp; 

The Russians had actually entered the war much earlier, but did not send many forces to the front, instead focusing their forces on invading Italian Persia. The only major offensive was in Germany, which was quickly repelled and responded to with the occupation of Poland. With both old, absolutist empires now in the world, it was clear to Italy what she must do. As the announcement in Rome came and was heard across the Empire, from Rome, to Cario, to Tehran, and to Brazzaville, crowds cheered, chanting ""It is our time!"". The King of Italy announced his plans for a New European Order, in which the calls self determination of the minorities in both Russia and Austria would finally be answered. All peoples would be freed from the old empires. Italy had decided, that the age of the Absolutist empires of Russia and Austria had ended. They were past their time, and Italy would be the one to pull the final plug. With renewed hope, the Italian Army began calling back their armies from Austria as the Germans swiftly occupied them.

≷• ܫ•≶ 

Soon would come one of the most ambitious military moves in the world. Determined to end the war early, the Italians brought back three army divisions to Rome, to meet the Royal fleet of Italy. These ships would be the soldiers homes for the next few days. The ships departed, destination: the Baltic Sea. The Italians would launch a naval invasion of St. Petersburg. When they arrived, they crushed the small Russian fleet, and entered the Gulf of Finland. At 10:00am, the landings began. With the Russians too occupied in Persia, they had no armies to spare for protecting their capital. St. Petersburg and Helsinki fell in a matter of days. The Italians swept down through the Pinsk Marshes, capturing Novgorod and Moscow in a matter of months. Five months after the landings, the Italians had reached Poltova and Kiev. The Russians, now without a valuable ally, began to become crushed.

&amp;nbsp; 

Earlier on in the war, the newly modernized Qing and Japanese Empires entered the war on the Italian side, both hoping to obtain chunks of Siberia. The Japanese launched an invasion of Outer Manchuria, but was pushed back to Vladivostok, not making many gains for themselves in the war. The Qing however, had a resounding success. After a few months of trench warfare in Mongolia, the Qing broke the Russian lines, and advanced freely into Siberia. They had reached the Arctic coast in a few months. Afterwards, the long slog through the Siberian forest began. The Russians had completely abandoned the front, hoping the shear amount of land would slow the Chinese down.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

They sent their final armies into Persia, the only successful part of the war for the Russians, hoping to at least be able to claim they were not completely defeated. With battles in the Caucuses, however, the Russian army completely fell apart. The fronts were closing in on all sides. By the end of 1903, the Chinese had done the unthinkable; they had crossed the Urals. The mighty hordes of Chinese armies reminded many historians of the Mongol invasion centuries ago. The Russian Empire was being slowly crushed, as Chinese and Italian armies met up in Central Asia. The war was finally over.

&amp;nbsp; 

With a final defeat in the Caucus Mountains, the remainder of the Russian army mutinied. At the end of the week, the Tsar had sued for peace. The war was over. The Allied forces set harsh terms on the Austrians and Russians, ensuring a war on this scale would never happen again. The Austro-Hungarian empire was completely dismantled, with all minorities granted freedom or their lands returned to their home countries. A rump state was all that was left.

♪┏((＝￣(ｴ)￣=))┛ ♪♬ 

The same had happened with Russia, they had to grant freedom to the Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Finnish, Belorussians, Ukrainians, Romanians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and the peoples of Central Asia. In addition, the Russians lost their Pacific coast to Kamchatka, a German satellite state designed to weaken the Russian influence in Asia. Russia was also forced to hand their Chinese holdings back, while ceding one of their ""treaty ports"" to Italy. The result, was a New World Order, in which Italy was above all. Italia sopra tutto!

0,False,"&gt; No, why would you make that assumption? Your political affiliation is of no interest, I am merely pointing out errors in your reasoning.

Apologies, bad assumption on my part.

&gt; Your argument is that no one would want to ever pay for anything they are currently not using, but may have used in the past or have close family that may use. That logic would make the whole insurance industry go belly up, an individuals incentive to pay for something is not exclusively tied to the individuals current use of that service.

No, I was merely making a factual statement that people paying for those services aren't using them.

&gt; I have never said that, where would you get that argument from?

From this:

&gt; the tax code could very easily be re written to mitigate any negative outcome.

&gt; I simply stated that your opinion on personal utility for education was in error

I think there is massive personal utility for education. I'm one of those nerds that has spent way too much time in school. That has nothing to do with my points in this thread though.

&gt; From your own link

Literally the next line after what you quoted was this: ""However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to an amount of your foreign earnings that is adjusted annually for inflation ($92,900 for 2011, $95,100 for 2012, $97,600 for 2013, $99,200 for 2014 and $100,800 for 2015)."" I will be deducting roughly 100k from my income this year, that is a massive tax savings and incentive to go abroad!

&gt;  this has still not lead to a mass exodus of corporations from US markets and that is due to existing consumer demand. 

I never said the exodus would be mass, or even large. All I said was:
raising taxes in the US makes it more expensive to do business here. This is an incentive to leave the US.

&gt; Your reasoning was that cost was the factor and that a free market would get lower prices

All else being equal, yes.

&gt; change your argument to quality instead of cost

No, because in your example all is isn't equal. You are comparing European colleges to U.S. colleges.

&gt; Are you saying now that the existence of free colleges in US would make quality lower?

No.

&gt; Please be clear in your arguments.

Apologies - I'm not very good at these types of typed out discussions. Let me be super clear about my points here: the OP asked about potential negative consequences from free college. Here is what I suggested

- ""free"" means pay for by tax dollars. It's possible higher taxes incentivize businesses to move to tax havens out of the US. Example: I made more money this year because I moved out of the US. Let me be super clear: I don't think a small increase in taxes causes a mass exodus of business. But a moderate increate in taxes might cause a small shift in business. It's up to us as a society decide whether this tradeoff is worth it. For example: police costs taxes, which probably does affect how many businesses stay / leave the country. On the other hand, a country without a police force is a lawless anarchy and if we got rid of the police, no one would want to do business here. However, if we raised taxes to 100% and gave every policeman a gold plated car, no one would want to do business here either (they wouldn't make any profit with 100% taxes). The right balance is somewhere in the middle. It's this curve:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve

I have no idea if we're on the right or the left side of the peak of that curve, but it's something to be aware of whenever we consider raising taxes.

- When the person paying for the service isn't the person using the service, there is less pressure on pricing. That is, when I was choosing college I was deciding between an expensive private school and a cheaper public school. If I didn't have to worry about price I might have gone to the private school (I went to the public school and had a great time by the way :) ). I don't know how big this effect would be, but all I'm saying is that it's a possibility.

0,False,"&gt; [I]t is generally harder for males to cross-dress in general due to the fact that, unlike females, males have body and facial hair.

I think it has more to do with the fact that most gender and sex cues point towards male: it’s not just body hair.

Also, women most definitely do have body hair! Women commonly remove hair from their legs, armpits, eyebrows (shaping), faces (stray hairs), pubic regions, arms, nipples, and stomachs, but hair in other places is not unheard of. And, when it comes to removing it, body hair is about the same between the sexes: men’s might be darker or longer, but shaving it is as much a pain for everyone. (I like Veet.)

&gt;&gt; [I]f it were up to me, I would make children, absent a parenting agreement (perhaps implicit in marriage), the sole responsibility of the mother.

&gt; Good to hear, though I myself am a bit torn over the “implicit in marriage” part; after all, would you likewise support preventing married women from getting abortions if their husbands forbade them from doing this?

I meant that it would be assumed unless otherwise agreed, similar to how the estate laws of many states provide for spousal inheritance by default. Anyway, it’s not going to happen: society will never consent to cutting fathers out of the picture to such a degree; and child support serves the important purpose of putting the financial burden on the biological mother and father (however much they may not wish to be parents) rather than taxpayers at large. It’s vain for me to speak as though my ideas have any chance of coming to fruition.

&gt;&gt; But I am distracted.

&gt; What exactly do you mean by this? I just want to clarify.

I meant that I was getting off topic.

&gt; I don’t want to completely pass as a cis-woman; after all, I want people (other than transphobes, obviously) to know that I am a trans-woman if they will look closely enough. I don’t know why, but imaging myself as a trans-woman is much more appealing to me than imaging myself as a cis-woman.

You can’t control other’s perceptions of your gender with such a high degree of precision. And, as a general rule, most people don’t have time to wonder about strangers that much. Gender, especially, is simply a fact of life for most of us (myself included now), not something we think about. Speaking from personal experience, you can get people to notice—I sure did when I was in transition and visibly androgynous—but even if they react positively, it’s a distractio, like wearing tin foil clothing.

&gt; I cannot cross-dress or anything of that sort due to my excessive body (everywhere other than on my back) and facial hair.

You can shave it all. I’ve read that skillful makeup application can do wonders for beard shadow too.

&gt; In regards to myself personally, though, I wonder if this risk [of street harassment] would be reduced if I had an androgynous appearance but wore “male” clothes; any thoughts on this?

I think so. I only started having problems when it wasn’t clear what I was: when I wore men’s clothes but had some obvious effeminate tendencies (long blonde hair, well-cared for by men’s standards; painted nails; a small satchel that I carried everywhere like a purse), I didn’t have any problems. I looked pretty fruity and wouldn’t recommend trying to make friends or get a job like that, but it wasn’t awful.

&gt; [D]id you ever prefer male pronouns over female pronouns?

No. I was content being a feminine man for a time, and I didn’t think I had much hope of successfully transitioning, but I would rather have been a woman. I didn’t ask anyone, even my close friends, to call me by my new name or refer to me with feminine pronouns until after I’d legally changed my name, by which point I “passed” more often than not with strangers.

&gt; I have also read that some/many/most transgender people already have brains which are more similar to the brains of the gender that they self-identify as even before they begin HRT.

That may be true, but the study I had in mind¹ was about the effects of HRT specificially, which would likely be independent of preexisting structural differences.

&gt; [A] criminal could . . . snatch my gun away from me when I am not looking (especially if it is me vs. several criminals), et cetera.

An assailant who could physically overpower you could likely kill you with his bare hands, and if you were approached by several assailants, you would shoot them before they had a chance to surround you or get within grabbing distance. But it’s your choice, and the gun-carrying argument has been extensively argued for and argued against by more persuasive people than me.

&gt; In regards to the tube tying part, I would like to point out that women can simply unilaterally utilize safe haven laws instead afterwards.

Sure, if they have the freedom and wealth to travel to a part of the world that provides abortions. And women of certain religious inclinations have no problem with sterilization but wouldn’t get an abortion even if they were raped. My point was that few other people, even women, the most common victims of non-prison rape, consider preemptive sterilization in case they’ll be raped, and that should give you pause.

&gt; “Likely murder charge”? Can you please elaborate on that part?

I meant that if someone raped me, and I knew who he was, there’s a fair probability that I’d hunt him down and kill him.

&gt;&gt; What you’re proposing is trading your submission to biology for submission to physicians and the medicines and surgery they authorize.

&gt; Yes, and your point here is?

You said that you were considering castration partly for preventing fertility, for overcoming your biology, I believe you said. And I was pointing out that, yes, you can correct your biology in that respect, but you’ll be dealing with physicians and surgeons and pharmaceuticals for the rest of your life instead.

&gt; You appear to have missed my point here; my point here was that what politically anti-abortion people expect women to do is the same to what your advised me to do. If it is unacceptable to tell this to biological females, then it is likewise unacceptable to tell this to biological males, and vice versa.

You’re right that it’s a double-standard, but nature itself dictates it, however much it infuriates you. When males share in pregnancy, you can have your pregnancy fairness; until then, you’re ranting at the wind. You’d have more luck arguing for women and men playing in the same football game.

Also, as I mentioned above, paternal child support obligations place the burden on fathers instead of taxpayers, and there’s a snowball’s chance in hell of seeing the voting public want to change that.

&gt; Can’t women check if they are pregnant very frequently, though?

Perhaps a very cautious woman would.

&gt; [A] large part of my arousal from the idea of [coitus] appears to come from the fact that the woman with whom I will have sex with doesn’t ever have to worry about the possibility of an unwanted offspring being born if she doesn’t want this to occur . . . .

I think you have a lot of preconceptions about coitus for someone who’s never experienced it. As with many things in life, you’re better off being open-minded instead of going into something new with imagined up expectations.

But you’re also very, very wrong about the risks and hassles women take in having coitus, in preventing pregnancy, and in terminating unwanted pregnancies. It’s *not* what you are imagining! I have neither the time nor the first-hand experience to set you straight here, but I suggest you spend some time learning about the subject. [AskWomen](/r/AskWomen) and [TwoX](/r/TwoXChromosomes) are good places to start, and, if you’re brave, you could tell them what you think—that your “arousal from the idea of [coitus] appears to come from the fact that the woman with whom [you] will have sex [won’t] ever have to worry about the possibility of an unwanted offspring being born if she doesn’t want this to occur”—and watch their reactions. :P

&gt;&gt; [W]omen primarily masturbate not by penetration but by stimulating their vulvas and clitorises . . . .

&gt; I masturbate with my hand as well; after all, I certainly don’t use a fake vagina in order to help me masturbate!

True, but the stimulation you receive from masturbating (movement along the penis) is comparable to the stimulation you would experience during coitus. It’s different for women: women typically masturbate by stimulating their vulvas, whereas intercourse primarily stimulates their vaginas. It’s a little like the difference between a man masturbating and a man being anally penetrated (and some men do orgasm from that).

Personally, I don't think that has much merit.  For one, the United States has certain advantages that are hard to overcome.  China and Europe both have huge demographic challenges on the horizon in the next couple of decades, while the U.S. continues to enjoy the advantage of a relatively young population driven partly by relatively welcoming immigration policies.  A lot of developing countries have problems with intellectual property protections, massive corruption in government, and weak justice systems, all of which stifle innovation and ultimately economic growth.  And it's often overlooked, but the U.S. has a ton of natural resources, including some of the best farmland in the world and the world's largest reserves of shale.

All empires eventually fall, and I'm sure the U.S. will be no exception.  But in the near to medium term, the future looks very bright for America.  The United States has problems, but all of its would-be successors on the world stage have much bigger problems, and few have comparable strengths.

&gt; when you come here, and you see free confident woman all over the place, what do you feel?

Hijabi women are just as free as you are, just because they choose to cover up does not make them less ''free'' than you. And some of them are incredibly confident, I know a ton of hijabis who are part of student councils, partake in volunteering and helping people etc. You might not intend to come over this way, but you're coming over as incredibly bigoted - just because someone chooses to cover in hijab does not make them less confident than you, nor does it make them less free than you. 

So what do I feel when I see ''free confident women all over the place''? I feel the same way when I see ''free confident women all over the place'' outside of Europe - because someone's confidence and freedom are independent of their religion or skin colour. Those free and confident people might be Christians, they might be atheists, they might be Muslims, they might be jews. I do not judge people on how ''free'' they are by whether they are wearing a hijab or not - that is bigoted. 

&gt; Are you angry about it? 

Do you take us to be barbarics? ''Arghhh these ''free women!' - we must enslave them!'' Please think before you speak. It's great you're asking these questions and I'm assuming you've never met a Muslim before which is why you're asking these questions - so that's fantastic! You choose to learn about us before you judge us, but the way you're posing these questions comes over in a very judgemental tone. 

&gt; If you see a Christmas tree or a church, does it bother you?

No. Churches exist in Turkey, they exist in China, they exist in America, they exist in Iraq, they exist in plenty of countries outside of Europe. Christmas trees do not solely belong to Europe either. And no I don't feel angry seeing them, they look beautiful. Islam protects the freedom of Christians to practise their religion - there is no need for us to feel ''angry'' at Christians for being Christian. In Islam they are referred to as ''People of the Book'' meaning they are part of our history.

&gt; Do you feel resentment againts white people? 

Again, white people don't only exist in Europe. I know a ginger white freckled face Syrian dude, and as an added note the ''Aryan race'' consists of natives from Iran &amp; East Afghanistan, where you can find some incredibly ''white'' people. People from Asia aren't only brown, they are white too, and some are incredibly dark skinned almost black. Besides that, Islam doesn't discriminate on race, white, black, brown, whatever colour you may be, we are equal. So no I don't hate white people. I know white people that aren't even native to Europe or the US.

You'll be behind the wheel for roughly 5 hours a day just going between these places, not including stops for gas, meals, or getting into and around town to places you want to see. Most of this time will be spent on the freeway, not looking at much uniqueness or scenery. 

In my personal experience, when you start trying to do 500 km or more in a day, the amount of time you spend driving vs. the amount of time you stop and take in where you are drops dramatically. If Miami isn't a fixed destination, I highly suggest you move your destination much further west; you could spend two weeks easily just roadtripping through southern California and Arizona. If you're committed to Miami as the destination, at least eliminate either Memphis/Nashville or New Orleans from your plans. The drive between those two adds 800 km to your trip, and there's not much to see along the way.

*However...* there is something about when Brazilians mix with with an international scene that doesn't result in anything pleasant. 

I've seen it first hand, over and over again. It's not a pretty sight.

I distance myself from any Brazilians I see or meet and have very few Brazilian friends locally (even though I used to live in a city that was packed full of them). I'm not sure if you had a chance to meet ""international Brazilians"" but they are purely entitled assholes. The don't give to shits about stepping over you and leaving you to rot. They are like leeches. There are people who will screw you over an lie right to your face and laugh about it.

Taxes are higher in European countries but the general consensus I see from Europeans in those countries (with a few exceptions) is that they get their money's worth. We have roughly the same amount of money going out from our paychecks, but to insurance and loans instead of to taxes. So no, it's not free, but it costs about the same and it doesn't mean a crippling debt burden. 

And this is necessary, I think, so that we can have a country with a ready pool of educated individuals who are educated and trained no matter their financial background. Maybe the guy or gal who can cure cancer is a poor kid in Cicero or something who'll never get that chance because they don't have access now to quality education.

0,False,"There's a reason he said that. While he says ""We'll accept it"", notice that they won't say they'll recognize Israel, or anything of the sort. That's because Hamas is playing word games.

http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-denies-group-could-recognize-israel/

&gt;“We acknowledge that Abbas’s recognition of the occupation is his traditional position, nothing new. The [Hamas] movement position is unwavering in not recognizing the occupation in any form. In any event, negotiations are the task of the PLO; the government has no part in them,” Abu Zuhri said.

Why do they say ""the occupation""? Because it sounds good. But what do they *mean* by the occupation? Well:

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hamas-accepts-1967-borders-but-will-never-recognize-israel-top-official-says-1.361072

&gt;Hamas would be willing to accept a Palestinian state within 1967 borders, a leader of the militant group, Mahmoud Zahar, told the Palestinian news agency Ma'an on Wednesday, adding, however, that Hamas would never recognize Israel since such a move would counter the group's aim to ""liberate"" all of Palestine.

Also:

&gt;Speaking to Ma'an on Wednesday, Zahar, hinting at the possible political line of a future Palestinian unity cabinet, said that recognizing Israel would ""preclude the right of the next generations to liberate the lands,"" wondering: ""What will be the fate of the five million Palestinians in the diaspora?""

All Hamas has done is publicly profess to something that can be twisted later down the line. It's the same tack that was taken by Yasser Arafat back in 1974, when the PLO was still carrying out its own acts of terror and not simply [funding them](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3243071.stm). Back then, Arafat worked on [the 10 point plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLO%27s_Ten_Point_Program), and it says (as in the link, in sections 2, 4, and 8):

&gt;""The Palestine Liberation Organization will employ all means, and first and foremost armed struggle, to liberate Palestinian territory and to establish the independent combatant national authority for the people over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated. This will require further changes being effected in the balance of power in favor of our people and their struggle.""

&gt;Any step taken towards liberation is a step towards the realization of the Liberation Organization’s strategy of establishing the democratic Palestinian State specified in the resolutions of the previous Palestinian National Councils.

&gt;Once it is established, the Palestinian national authority will strive to achieve a union of the confrontation countries, with the aim of completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.

All Hamas did was leave out Section 8, in favor of looking better. They don't have ""reasonable moments"". They had the opportunity in 2006 to avoid a blockade and a mess by simply recognizing Israel, renouncing terror, and agreeing to abide by past Palestinian governments' agreements, and they refused the Quartet (EU, US, UN, Russia).

Anyway, at one point I was standing there going, ""my stomach is *full* of vodka and I don't have a buzz."" I was literally full. You know, I-just-ate-meatloaf full.

0,False,"&gt; ""Comment est-il possible, bandes de nuls, que ce scénario n'ait pas été envisagé?

Ca a été tout à fait envisagé dès le départ. La construction européenne est incrémentale et les personnes à l'origine de l'union économique et monétaire (pour référence c'est Trichet et Schauble qui ont été les principaux négociateurs du Traité de Maastricht) pensaient qu'un gouvernement économique fédéral avec un budget propre et des transferts organisés se mettrait en place.

&gt; Je ne sais pas s'il existe une opinion européenne unique

J'en sais rien non plus par contre quasiment toutes les opinions publiques nationales auront des raisons d'être énervées si on lâche la bride à la Grèce. Genre l'Europe du Nord parce qu'ils auront fait cadeau d'argent ce qui est pas dans leurs moeurs ou les pays qui ont eu à suivre un programme de redressement parce que eux auront pas eu cette fleur.

&gt; le peiple grec doit payer pour avoir élu des gens malhonnêtes et incompétents

C'est un peu l'hypocrisie de l'argumentaire de Tsipras. Il agite la souveraineté du peuple grec mais la même source est à l'origine de la situation actuelle de la Grèce. C'est justement parce que c'est le peuple grec qui est souverain qu'un nouveau gouvernement ne peut pas se défaire aussi facilement des engagements pris par des gouvernements précédents.

&gt; quand nos banques feront faillites parce qu'elles ont misé sur un non-défaut de la Grèce.

Là j'ai pas compris. Tout le monde mise et espère un non-défaut de la Grèce depuis le début. On a mis en place à une vitesse surprenante pour l'Europe les mécanismes permettant de l'éviter quitte à tordre quelques règles au passage (notamment au niveau de la BCE, cf. les prises de position de Jens Weidmann). C'est un peu gratuit et populiste de taper sur les banques sur ce point-là. Je te rejoindrai si tu rappelais que la crise des dettes souveraines a pour origine une crise bancaire avec la recapitalisation au frais des états que ça a entraîné mais ça concernerait plus l'Irlande ou l'Espagne que la Grèce.

&gt; La France a plusieurs fois fait défaut sur des dettes dans son histoire. Ça rend les taux hauts et les banquiers frileux pendant des années mais on s'en remet.

Ca a aussi un effet potentiellement désastreux sur les populations, ce qu'on accuse le programme de la Troïka de faire. C'est un peu tomber de Charybde en Scylla. L'Argentine subit encore les effets de sa stratégie après la crise de 1998 et pourtant elle au moins à des exports significatifs. En plus le contexte est quand même tout à fait différent puisque la Grèce a des engagements vis-à-vis d'autres états souverains avec lesquels elle a une union économique et monétaire. C'est à des années-lumières de faire défaut seul dans son coin.

&gt; Et puis, il y a des exceptions: la France a un contrôle sur l'euro[1] que n'a pas la Grèce. On en a très peu parlé mais la France peut ""faire des euros"" comme elle veut.

A priori on en a très peu parlé parce que l'origine c'est une source unique et anonyme datant de 2013 jamais confirmée ou recoupée pour expliquer la baisse des taux français. Mais tu as raison sur le fond, il y a eu et il y a encore des exceptions, certaines malsaines (la France et l'Allemagne se mettant d'accord pour ignorer le pacte de stabilité en 2003) d'autres moins (la BCE faisant du quantitative easing ou acceptant des junks bonds pour pouvoir continuer à financer la Grèce).

J'ai un gros problème avec la solution du défaut:

- On voit mal dans quelle situation ça va mettre la Grèce. Je ne suis pas certain que ce soit préférable à ce que l'Europe lui demande en échange de son aide.

- Ca tendrait à démontrer d'une part que la Grèce est un pays incapable de tenir ses engagements et d'autre part que l'Europe est un tigre de papier.

I don't know, Poland participated heavily in Iraq and Afghanistan, so I'd say they do have it, if not more than Russia does.

&gt;""Dae russia broke?""

That wasn't really my point there. 5th Gen fighters are costly and extremely complicated to develop, so I take it as a sign that the Russian aviation industry isn't quite ready yet for 5th gen and beyond.

&gt;I do expect the Armata to be mass produced within 5 years.

Maybe, but bear in mind that the Armata is basically the modern T-80, in the sense that it's meant to supplement the T-90, *not* replace it.

&gt;The newer variants of the T-90 are much more capable than the original T-90.

For sure, but they are still behind western tank development.

&gt;My point is that Russia does have the capability to overrun Poland.

No doubt, I'm not really disputing that, I'm just disputing that they could take Warsaw in a day.

&gt;I'd argue that in a single nation vs Russia, only a few in Europe could defend against it.

Definitely, most single European nations don't have the capability to stand up to Russia.

&gt; Anyways, pretty much all of us know that Russia attacking Poland would certainly meet a NATO response, and thus Russia would almost certainly not win against that.

I'm glad we agree on that part.

The fact is that most European antisemites of the 19th and 20th C. didn't care about these other groups (Akkadians, Assyrians, etc.) because they considered it fundamentally correct that different races were living in ""their own"" lands, at least until a stronger nation comes and destroys them.

The US while percentage wise is on the upper end..  But our raw amount that is spent is massive.  Meanwhile, Russia, the most immediate threat to EU members doesn't spend nearly as much as the top 3 EU members being Germany, France, and the UK.

Maybe the idea is that you don't need to dedicate so much money out of your economy at all times unless you are at war?  But then again the US does a good job of being in wars constantly.  Point is, I don't buy that argument.  Our military isn't there to protect NATO, it's there to protect OUR interests and ours alone.

What the US needs to do is close up our tax system so that corporations can't get away with paying a pittance of what they should.  We have experience run away capitalism.

But if England and France are both out of the war, then the oil reserves of the middle east are there for the Axis powers to take.

0,False,"&gt; Someone tried to fuck Greece in the first place to achieve something else. 

&gt;The status of Greece was known since the Euro membership and suddenly after 10 years the trust was gone. 

That seems to be a popular believe in Greece. 

Unfortunately, the sorry truth is that past Greek governments fucked their own country by excessively borrowing, hiding the debts with the help of Goldman-Sachs, and falsifying fiscal statistics to join the Eurozone.

&gt;When for some reasons the trust on Greece lowered, Greek industry hadn't longer access to loans to competitive conditions, which rendered Greek industry complete uncompetitive.

That is a monumental understatement: everyone knows what the *""some reasons""* are that have been blocking Greece from commercial credits for years now. 

&gt;But since nothing worked longer, technocrats from the EU overtook the control and gave Greece a recipe which strangled the national economy and reduced the income of the state further. 

As the first article I linked to points out, austerity worked in other PIIGS nations. It does not work in Greece, because of its economic structural weaknesses.  

&gt;Syriza is a classical social democratic movement, with a little tendency to a radicalism, because of the hopeless status.

That is, again, a substantial understatement, given that [Syriza is not a single movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza), but a broad coalition of political groups, including 

&gt;Marxist–Leninist, Maoist, Trotskyist, Eurocommunist, Luxemburgist and also Eurosceptic components.

&gt;Germany, UK, Sweden, France and Denmark needs the EU for the export. 

The British are actually thinking of leaving the EU, and the Germans have been exporting more and more to countries outside the EU, mostly in Asia. 

&gt; A dissolving of the EU would be the worst case for them. 

No one is talking of *""dissolving the EU""* - it is the Greek membership in the Eurozone that is under debate.

0,False,"Yeah, it's really unfortunate. I was born in Ukraine, and speak only Russian. Before the conflict, I was pretty indifferent whether people saw me as Russian or Ukrainian. I happily identified as Russian and felt great pride in being able to trace my roots to Russia. My father's side is ethnically-Ukrainian, and lived through Stalin's purges, and so I don't have much info left on that side of my family. Someone in my family dug in, and allegedly there may have been some ties to the UPA/OUN or something. I would honestly love to know more but I can't help but think how much info vanished.

On my mother's side, the one I previously identified most with, my great grandfather was a fighter pilot. The victory day celebrations were pretty special to me, and we would always watch the Russian New Years celebrations on TV. I would see people walk in CCCP T-shirts and I'd want to give them a thumbs up. I really took great pride in being ethnically Russian.

Now, *I can't even*. Even in Toronto, Ukrainian-Russian relations are tense, the exception being Victory Day, where everybody raised their flags and simply honoured veterans. On normal days (around the Crimean takeover), it just came across as spiteful when people raised their giant 3x5 Russian/Soviet flags over their cars as though they were somehow the better bunch. Usually ended up being some young adults cruising down Bathurst in their civics/Nissans. Before, I'd look at them and think ""Hey, there's fellas are having fun"", now it just comes across as disrespectful. It's scary how subconsciously and fast views change.

I still talk to my Russian friends who have been moderate in their views, so long as we can respect each other's views. Those from Saint Petersburg actually tend to be more moderate, whereas those coming from farther East (Moscow, Yekaterinburg, Kirov) have much strongly patriotic and often hardline views. I've heard from them that ""Alaska is Russian, not American"", as well as ""The Americans created the wars in Chechnya"", and obviously ""The CIA is behind the Maidan coup"". Those are the ones who have been a pain to talk to.

Not surprisingly, I also heard things like ""MH370 was hijacked by the Americans and used over Ukraine"", seen posts like this [February 2014](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhqS0S2CMAA7xG2.png) and this [January 2014](http://s.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2013/11/25/11/1385401283_1348612652.jpg). It was unsettling to see how up in arms many Russian patriots were and how anxious they were to fight fascists and Europeans.

Of course, now I sound heavily biased towards Ukrainians (which I probably am), but I've heard from Ukrainians as well and I know crazy when I see it. Ukrainian-Canadians who believe patriotic pro-war Russians should leave Canada, Ukrainians who refuse to believe that Ukraine has done anything wrong, Ukrainians who believe any aggressive behaviour on the part of Ukrainian nationalists is simply ""Titushki"" and ""Russian propaganda"".

&gt;And I think you are overestimating the amount of work they needed to do.

I'm actually underestimating it.  If you knew anything about mobile app development you'd know this.

&gt;Microsoft basically offered Pebble to make the app, or at least help to make the app, but apparently Pebble told them ""no"" (or ""fuck off"" even, who knows).

&gt;As /u/dos101[1] linked to: http://www.windowscentral.com/pebble-microsoft-and-what-could-have-been-windows-phone[2] 

That article is bullshit, as I already pointed out.

Regardless, even if it *was* true - which it is not - the Phone app is only a *tiny portion* of the necessary development to add an entire hardware platform like Pebble, to an OS like WP.  

The firmware end of it is just as complicated, if not more so, as is the SDK, and so on.

In order to acheive feature parity with iOS and Android it would take dozens of developers likely working for a year or more, just to accomplish this, and for what? To sell a few thousand watches?

0,False,"I think there is a lot of room for improvement in the psychiatric profession, and also in many other professions.  Do the police enforce the law fairly and in accordance with the way the laws are written, or do they become a power in themselves who feel free to execute people at will?  Do politicians act on behalf of the people who elect them, to give the most effective legislation and governance they can, or do they instead act in the best interests of lobbyists and major campaign contributors?  Are members of the clergy interested in religious missions to better humanity and serve God, or in sexually molesting children who have been placed in their care?  Do lawyers want to help you with your legal problems or bleed you dry with their extortionate fees?  There is corruption everywhere in human society because that is the way human beings are, we are largely motivated by selfishness, and even then, are often too stupid even to understand where our selfish interest actually lies.

So, the Church of Scientology and its front group, the CCHR, take an exaggerated view of the failings of psychiatry based on the way psychiatry used to be in the 1950's and comprehensively denounce it as a useless and harmful activity which should be abolished.  They have never said what mentally ill people should do, or what kind of help they might receive.  One of your numerous complaints is that psychiatrists will sometimes prescribe atypical anti-psychotic medication without trying CBT.  But if we abolish psychiatry, then nobody gets CBT, there will no longer be any therapists to administer it.  In theory, you could just get a book on the subject and treat yourself.  Of course in theory you can do everything yourself, build your own house, treat your own illness, do your own law enforcement as a vigilante, and so forth.  In practice this can be difficult.  

Suppose we abolish psychiatry, but we allow pharmacists to sell psychiatric medication to those who want it.  You get to diagnose yourself, pick your own treatment, and use the drugs you want to use.  No everyone is really prepared to do this intelligently or sanely, but I am sure it would work for a certain number of people.  Even then, the Church of Scientology would still be opposed to the use of psychiatric medication.  They are not going to meet you halfway.

Some psychiatric patients are genuinely dangerous.  Those people do exist.  They are not all friendly nice people with some quaint form of obsessive compulsive behavior.  The legal system makes allowances for the fact that sometimes people commit a crime without knowing what they are doing, and are innocent by reason of insanity.  But to be able to do that, you have to have an alternative to prison.  You can't just release dangerously insane people back to the population on the grounds that they are innocent.  We do not really want to give them an unlimited license to kill people, or do whatever harm they like.  You have to be prepared to either put them in jail, which they don't deserve, or give them psychiatric treatment, even if they have to be compelled to receive it.

There are many things that do not entirely work, in our present society.  We have done enormous environmental damage to the planet, which is going to get worse.  War is raging in a number of nations, with all the indiscriminate death and destruction that war brings.  The global economy remains unhealthy, has never really recovered from the 2008 recession, and is likely to get worse.  Greece is expected to default on its loans, and the European Union may fall apart.  Russia is engaged in territorial expansion and is taking an increasingly aggressive stance.  The US government has been financially mismanaged for decades and is also moving toward bankruptcy.  The ridiculously high national debt simply gets higher every year, with no end in sight, no way ever to balance a budget again.  These are some of the social problems that we deal with.  Added to that, not all psychiatrists practice their profession in a responsible manner, and they sometimes over-prescribe psychiatric medication.  They are not really any more fallible than any other sector of human society.  

But I can think of ways to do without psychiatry.  First, we eliminate the insanity defense.  If someone commits a crime we are not interested in their excuses.  They will be imprisoned or executed, depending upon the severity of the offense.  Then, we allow pharmacists to give people whatever drugs they want, without requiring prescriptions.  If people need CBT, public libraries should keep a supply of self-help books on the subject.  If we did these things, then  we could eliminate the profession of psychiatry.

When historians say ""American manufacturing"", what we are talking about is industrial might brought to bear on an opponent rather than human waves or siege warfare. 


When you consider breathtaking industrial capacity where fighter and bomber aircraft production was measured by ""N MINUTES per unit produced"", with the goal of most that hardware being to destroy German ball bearing plants, refineries, munitions factories and depots, rail lines, and anything else useful to the Wehrmacht - that's significant. 


The soviets did not have to receive materiel from the U.S. to benefit from it. Our bombers darkened German skies daily with destruction. The resources available for the Germans to being to bear on the eastern front were directly crippled by both the allied air campaign and invasion of Europe.


The US was a power transitioning into the technological age, while the soviets were a largely pastoral society barely post-industrial.  Each brought to the party the tools they had. The Americans built the best bombers, best fighter aircraft, best aircraft carriers, and several other things - and built them in quantities that stagger the mind. The soviets had a huge resource of human lives to throw at the problem, and throw they did. It wasn't until Stalin finally realized  Zhukov was a brilliant commander and gave him free reign that the soviet approach went from barbaric human wave assaults to truly modern, inspired infantry tactics. 



TL;DR - we had factories in the US rolling B17s and B24s out the door faster than the Germans could shoot them down. 

That, my friends, is a huge part the Americans contribution to the allied victory. High quality machinery produced in staggering quantity that achieved high KDR.

Article 8

Right to reimbursement or re-routing

1. Where reference is made to this Article, passengers shall be offered the choice between:

(a) - reimbursement within seven days, by the means provided for in Article 7(3), of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought, for the part or parts of the journey not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose in relation to the passenger's original travel plan, together with, when relevant,

- a return flight to the first point of departure, at the earliest opportunity;

(b) re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at the earliest opportunity; or

(c) re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at a later date at the passenger's convenience, subject to availability of seats.

2. Paragraph 1(a) shall also apply to passengers whose flights form part of a package, except for the right to reimbursement where such right arises under Directive 90/314/EEC.

3. When, in the case where a town, city or region is served by several airports, an operating air carrier offers a passenger a flight to an airport alternative to that for which the booking was made, the operating air carrier shall bear the cost of transferring the passenger from that alternative airport either to that for which the booking was made, or to another close-by destination agreed with the passenger.

Article 9

Right to care

1. Where reference is made to this Article, passengers shall be offered free of charge:

(a) meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time;

(b) hotel accommodation in cases

- where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary, or

- where a stay additional to that intended by the passenger becomes necessary;

(c) transport between the airport and place of accommodation (hotel or other).

2. In addition, passengers shall be offered free of charge two telephone calls, telex or fax messages, or e-mails.

3. In applying this Article, the operating air carrier shall pay particular attention to the needs of persons with reduced mobility and any persons accompanying them, as well as to the needs of unaccompanied children.

0,False,"Ahoy! /u/yaboibillnye! Glad to hear you're looking for a bad ass vehicle of the night such as the ST... Allow me to pop an answer that these here questions:

* Why the Focus ST and not the GTI?

This depends on what you want to do with the car after market in my opinion. The ST offers a lot more in the way of space, technology and general appearance (subjective of course on the latter). The GTI, though, is a lot more receptive to heavy mods and Stage 1/2 beats the ST- as much as it pains me to say that. The engine wants you to add stuff to it hahah. But for the money, I would get the ST as I hate GTIs and the majority of people that drive them are dolts.

* Would the car be comfortable/reliable enough for about 2-3 weeks of nonstop cross-continental driving?

Yes, it would, BUT! I would argue that it depends on the seat choice. If you go with the ST3, then you're getting the Recaro Leather Seats- which I love the bawlz out of. The biggest complaint about those seats though is that any drive over 2 hours (really over 90 minutes) turns out to be really uncomfortable. In your case, I'd look at a ST2 with navigation- it'd be the same as a ST3.


* Would there be enough room for two people's luggage on said trip? (a few suitcases and a laundry basket maybe)

Absolutely, especially with the capability to fold down the seats. I have a friend who has a GTI and my car easily has far more room than his. The ST is larger and has more room

* Does the crowded instrument cluster prove to be distracting and unintuitive?

It's actually not as crowded as the images make it out to be. Most of the press photos are of the European console which is just rubbish. Too many buttons, knobs, and buttons, with knobs. If you get the Navigation, it's pretty well divided in fourths and easily understood. Dare I say intuitive ;)

* What are the key differences when it comes to the driving experience between this car and a competitor (like the GTI)?

Of all of the current hatches on the market (Sorry, STI, you're not a hatch anymore :( ) it smokes the competition. The Mazda doesn't hold a flame, the Lexus is pewped upon, and the GTI comes close but still is outclassed by the ST from a purely stock perspective. You can argue up and down about after marketability, but I'm looking fresh from the dealer stock here. The GTI is a bit of a stiffer ride/drive, and doesn't like to drag its ass as much as the ST will. the ST plays with under-steer a lot more than the GTI as well making it feel like a go-kart on steroids, but somehow in a semblance of control haha. The ST, while a larger car, just feels more ""fun."" Having driven and been driven in a GTI, I'm just not impressed. I also am not very happy with our local VW dealer, so that's a personal bias yet again. 

The new Mazda 6 Speed has some promise, but the current one isn't really going to hold a flame to the GTI let alone the ST. I read a great review between the Mazda vs. GTI vs. ST, let me see if I can find it.

Also keep in mind that outside of LBS and IESE, most of the programs are 1 year. This is another topic for you to think about 1 yr vs  2 yr). 

Lastly, most US schools will have exchange options. So if you just want to run around Europe for a bit.. do an exchange + perhaps a second internship or something in Europe.

The crowded streets in the evenings when people finish work. TST around Hanoi and Caernvon Road are always packed.

0,False,"**Brazil** 

Well, I hope you guys don't mind me saying, but I believe both speaks_in_subreddits and nabillac are a little misinformed about the Brazilian scene. First, there are dozens of Brazilian Facebook groups about Roleplaying, several very active. The biggest groups are about every RPG, but the ones about specific RPGs are in many too.


I think there arent too many Brazilians because most of them prefer to discuss only in portuguese, even when they know English. I use mostly english speaking groups in FB, and rpg.net, I heard about this thread in Portuguese RPG Facebook Group and I came to check it out.

The Brazilian scene is actually doing very fine. We dont have so many people going to events, but we have a lot of us playing at home with friends. 

The Brazilian Scene is dominated by D&amp;D. As speaks said, Devir holds the copyright so it kinda still give the cards.  Brazilian players dont like diversity, at least not the current community, so you will see most of the players looking to play only things they already know. I have a few theories about it because I organise events and need to know what to make to being more players but I will not go into it.

Besides the majority wanting to play specifically D&amp;D 3.5 and Pathfinder, we have a growing stronger community wanting to play other things. Things are starting to change. That gave space for smaller publishers try their luck into the market, and we are seeing a lot of games coming and released because of it. The crowdfunding model made things possible and made available many games as FATE, Numera, Call of Cthullhu and other American and European Games. Small publishers dominate the market where D&amp;D doesn't fit, Devir (the only big publisher) does not Publish many things besides D&amp;D, and since Wizards ins't allowing the 5a to be translated (and I think that is GREAT, because will make RPG players in Brazil to try other games) we have at the moment only the small business running the game.


The Brazilian scene, in my perception, can be divided in two groups: The regular players and the Indie Players. The Regular players don't play games in English, or if they do, only in age-old groups among friends, and don't interact with the community (go to events, discuss in groups, etc). The Indie RPG is made of players trying new stuff because they are starting to play or just tired of D&amp;D, and the larger part, made of people who also create games. They have built a very strong movement and they are the ones making things happen currently. Most of the small publishers (I would say all of them) came from these group or at least are in direct relationship with them. They have been organising events, helping people to Publish their games, they have an Annual event called ""Laboratório de Jogos"" (Gaming Lab) where they discuss the industries, creating games, whats next, things like that. Its small event but well known in the international gaming community. They also have a few contests for creating games.
We have now small publishers as Secular Games, Redbox Editora, Retropunk Editora, New Order Editora, Terra incógnita, Kobold's Den, Flying Ape, and a few more, all of them publishing at least two different games, I think it shows the market is not as dead as you think.

They even have a magazine about the Scene, in English (link below) and portuguese. I think would be an interesting reading for those curious to know more about the Small publishing Industry.

https://analogxp.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/the-analog-xp-issue-2/

I am not saying the scene is huge as used to be, but the brazilian scene is doing very well. Creatively we are doing better than ever. There are many Brazilian-created games being published, and we even have Brazilian writers getting international Attention, we have a Brazilian Game that won the International Game Chef in 2013 and we have Pedro Ziviani getting awards for the american Chaosium Publisher with his Mythic Iceland.

EIRPG isn't anymore the biggest event. We have the World RPG Fest in Curitiba, that is more influent in the Gaming industry than EIRPG currently, I Believe, at least the guys behind the publishers seem to be far more interested in that event.

COPIA ESTO Y ENVÍASELO A PILAR DEL CASTILLO, SIGUIENDO LAS INDICACIONES DEL SITIO WEB DE ARRIBA, *REEMPLAZANDO MI NOMBRE CON EL TUYO*



Estimada Miembra del Palamento Europeo Pilar del CASTILLO VERA,

Quiero pedirle que, una vez más, salvaguarde la neutralidad de internet.

En abril de 2014 el Parlamento Europeo votó a favor de reglas claras y vinculantes en pro de la neutralidad de la red a través de la regulación ""Telecom Single Market"". Esto es un llamamiento para que defienda esta decisión, la cual está en el interés de los ciudadanos Europeos, durante las negociaciones a tres bandas que tendrán lugar en los próximos meses.

El presidente de la Comisión Europea, Jean-Claude Juncker, prometió un mercado único digital y esto requiere una sólida protección de tanto los ciudadanos como el contenido y proveedores de aplicaciones que utilizan internet a diario.

De momento, los usuarios de Internet pueden acceder a contenidos, ya provengan de pequeños blogs, sitios de noticias, sitios web del gobierno, o grandes empresas mediáticas, con igual facilidad, pero a menos que se adopten reglas claras que consagren la neutralidad de, y prohiban la discriminación contra, cualquiera de dichos proveedores de contenidos por parte de los proveedores de banda, estos últimos podrán crear ""vías rápidas"" donde unas pocas empresas que paguen por el privilegio conseguirían acceso prioritario a sus clientes, obligando a cualquiera que no tenga considerables recursos económicos (como los sitios web más pequeños o los servicios educativos y públicos) a utilizar un servicio subpar. Los teleoperadores podrían de esta manera elegir a los ganadores y perdedores del mercado, así comenzando una nueva era de discriminación en línea en la UE. Esto sería una desventaja a nivel mundial, dado que el público y las empresas de Estados Unidos han sido hace poco protegidas de tales restricciones.

En 2014, el Parlamento Europeo se puso en pie, con miles de ciudadanos luchando para preservar la neutralidad de internet. Más de 40.000 faxes, miles de e-mails, y cientos de llamadas telefónicas dejaron claro que la ciudadanía Europea pretende defender sus derechos fundamentales de libre acceso a la información. Le estoy pidiendo que, una vez más, haga caso a la voz de su ciudadanía.

Cordialmente, 
Gabriel Odebrecht Figueroa
Ciudadano de España

0,False,"&gt;After the first litter we'd fix them, in the 20 years of owning cats, I can think of one incident where a cat caught a bird, everything else was field mice and grasshoppers, which were also quite rare because we fed the cats. 

Anecdotal evidence trumps scientific research everytime.

&gt;so the ""hunting is not inextricably linked to hunger"" is a load of BS from my personal experience. 

JFC

&gt;It's like saying ""there are studies showing sugar doesn't make children hyper"" until you have your own children and you find that to be another load of idiotic tripe.

My god are you for real

I'm out. This is literally *exactly* what happens whenever you try to talk facts with butthurt cat owners. Blah blah blah my experience &gt; exhaustively researched studies. It's funny too because in just another thread I was bitching about willfull ignorance and then whammo here we go again. 

Have fun with your outdoor cats, and I hope they get hit by cars/killed by raptors/coyotes (wait you're in Europe)/taken to a homeless shelter by well-meaning individuals who are (rightly) trying to correct the issue of wild ranging cats. 

And yes, does that make me sound petty and spiteful? Sure. Why? Because fucking cats are always in my yard, hunting the box turtles that have lived there since hatching, hunting the snakes that live in the woodpiles, hunting the migratory birds and the nesting areas, and generally being a royal pain in the fucking ass because Mr Whiskers *deserves* to be free. 

If you'd keep your dog on a leash, keep your fucking cat on a leash. If you wouldn't let your dog run wild (because it's illegal) don't fucking let your cat run wild.

And for the record, your source examines only birds. And it isn't an all or nothing situation, christ, you come across like the mouth-breathers in congress when confronted with climate change issues. 'Welllll if x is bad but y is worse why don't you just deal with y and let x be?' If you quite seriously think that that method of reasoning is perfectly acceptable, then I think I'll stick why my original thought, which was something about willful ignorance.

For a final note: here's some numbers.

Total cat predation of birds per year, lowballing: 1.7billion

1/3 of 1.7 billion is 566million. That's how many birds Mr Whiskers kills because he isn't hungry and is fed regularly. *Not* feral cats. 

6.9 billion mammals total, annually. Which you cannot try to avoid with concern trolling about windows.

And now, compare that to the numbers thrown out by that 'article' you linked. I use quotes as it was a painful read filled with 'my feeling is', 'what i think', 'this is probably, but hasn't been studied' which, of course, seems to be the level of accuracy par for the course for you to latch onto. That number states 97million on the low end, for window deaths.

97 million from windows.

500 million from cats.

From the same source. Is it difficult to be this shit at reading?

Now for an [actual study](http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr191/Asilomar/pdfs/1029-1042.pdf) that puts the numbers for windows at 500 million to 1 billion birds per year.

Do me a favor, and puzzle out which is a larger number: 1.7, or 1.

*Global Research is correct in guessing that no more than Saudi involvement in 911 will be revealed should any currently classified documents get declassified. The truth about the Bush family’s involvement, and in particular Dick Cheney’s central orchestration of events, was never investigated, so cannot be declassified. Putin was threatening to release 911 satellite images during the Ukraine standoff, and all this was in process well before the October 20 announcement date was missed. We have mentioned that the rats are starting to turn on each other, and even though 911 is not central to the cover-up [on Nibiru], proof lies in many hands, it is likely that by this process 911 justice will result.*

One thing I noticed when reviewing resumes from kids just out of college that ticks me the wrong way is when they try to hype up some experience which is obviously not really beneficial to their employment. I can't tell you how many people try to brag how much their Study Abroad in London makes them a better employee.  I was in college myself not too long ago, you're not fooling anyone. I know damn well you spent your time in Europe partying, hooking up with foreign girls, &amp; barely passing your mandatory classes.  

Or if your only experience was serving at a restaurant...don't try to hype it up like you were managing a multi-million dollar customer service conglomerate. 

My number one pet peeve when reviewing applications tho is anything that shows they did not read the full instructions in the job description. If I explicitly state put ""Account Executive Position"" in the subject line of the email...thats not an invitation to make up your own subject. If I tell you to put ""I am a dick cheese muncher"" in the subject line...you better damn well put it.

If I tell you to include a cover letter...that means an actual cover letter, not a couple sentences in the body of the email.

0,False,"Since America has shifted very much away from relying on voters and relying on vote manipulation/social engineering and big donations from special interest groups it is worth asking why you care about core beliefs?  

Core beliefs are what the party **says** it stands for (other than power). Core interests are what the party **does** after it wins an election.  Core beliefs  matter a bit more for example in Europe where the politics is a bit more messy because of revolutions, changes, wars etc. - but even there the countries with the more stable systems move towards ""interest"" way of working politics through leveraging the rules rather than ""belief"" which is focusing on voters.

In America politics works very much like in Britain - it doesn't matter what the parties say you can **know** what they'll do. The only difference was Blair's ""New Labour"" but that was a generational change.

In terms of core interests both parties rely on Wall Street and the financial sector to exactly the same extent.  The Republicans are much closer to the oil and gas industry while Democrats are closer to the renewable energy sector. Republicans are closer to military and defense sector while Democrats are closer to general manufacturing.  Democrats in general are closer to labour unions while Republicans typically oppose them.

The ""new technologies"" that is IT, pharmaceutical and bio-tech industries really go both ways. Other sectors of the economy depend on the region and the state.

Oh.. Republicans are closer to a very important special interest group - nationalist Israelis and American Jews. The kind of people who support Israel no matter what although the carefully engineered support and influence go far in both parties.

The aliens can have spies wherever and influence the directions things go from the shadows when the first game ended.. (its not like Xcom in EU can find ALL the Exalt spies). The aliens got the tech and patience to make it work regardless, and i woul dhave expected them to change tactic from ""brutal conquest"" to ""subtle conversion over time"" at the end of EU. In the end they get the augmented human population they want so bad. Same result, but different tactic.

The only over thing they'd need to do, is having a bunch of alien ""refugees"" (snakemen, native muton speciest ect) show up to get some of earth's ""freedom"" to put the need aliens types on earth.

Xcom would still be allowed to be active, as under-funded guardian (after all, they did win 20 years ago.. right?

Small squads? Cmon.

In many European languages, ""opus"" is used to mean ""entire body of work"". For instance, ""Picasso's opus mostly consists of geometrical deconstruction"".

So far my research shows I can achieve my rtw for less than half the OneWorld or Star Alliance economy fares. For many flights I will be using Premium Economy or Business and the total is still less than their Economy fares.

0,False,"&gt; The Water Framework Directive, which we had an exemption for until Alan Kelly decided not to renew it, makes a big deal of the polluter pays principle.

That's a common misconception which was propagated at the time. The WFD allows a member state to avoid implementing charges under article 9 if - by 2010 - it has achieved the following:

- that water-pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of this Directive,

- an adequate contribution of the different water uses, disaggregated into at least industry, households and agriculture, to the recovery of the costs of water services, based on the economic analysis conducted according to Annex III and taking account of the polluter pays principle.

Ireland didn't achieve either of these goals, and by the time of the EU/IMF bailout, we were breaching the directive. As a condition of same, we had to comply with the WFD. This was a relatively fair deal, considering that we could have been taken to the CJEU and lost millions as the alternative.

&gt;What will be the alternative when IW fails spectacularly?

If it fails spectacularly. For all the flaws, the majority of the country will pay their water charges. 

&gt;What about the plans for future privatisation that were leaked?

Could you link me the source for that please?

&gt;Why does it take the signature of only two ministers to make it privatised, and why wasn't the provision which many called for to copper-fasten against any future privatisation implemented? 

Because that's legislation. Legislation can overturn older legislation. Without a referendum to guarantee the non-privatization of IW (which I support) there'll always be that risk. But it is a risk that exists with literally every piece of law emanating from the Oireachtas.

&gt;And finally, why has one of the ministers who set up Irish Water said we have “real reason to be concerned” about the possibility of Irish Water being privatised.

For brownie points. There's nothing solid in his warning. Just vague commentary.

&gt;Yes, Cais is giving an opinion, much like I am. But it seemed disingenuous, in multiple ways to me and so, after months of seeing his name on IW and Do'B articles, I called him on it.

Humanity doesn't have ""natural situations"". We're resourceful enough we *could* create any kind of society we want to. We are usually told otherwise without sufficient evidence to the contrary, this mindless repeating that ""society/the economy will collapse!"" We cannot have women in the work place, or blacks freed from slavery, or allowing either to vote -- ""society will collapse!"" It will always be this same argument, without any reasoning behind it. It's the same with basic income now. 

Society collapsed in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina. People lost all security, food and shelter. That's when collapse happens. Otherwise it's likely this same mindless conservative panic. 

&gt;it is through that capitalist system that lifts and helps the majority of people out of those situations?

Capitalism didn't lift and free the Native Americans very well. It killed most of them. Which anyone would expect, because the first time Christopher Columbus met them, he wrote in his journal that they would make good slaves. ""They should be good servants .... I, our Lord being pleased, will take hence, at the time of my departure, six natives for your Highnesses."" A few days later: ""with fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them."" Hardly a gift. 

And what did Columbus have to say about the people he was going to enslave? ""they are artless and generous with what they have, to such a degree as no one would believe but him who had seen it. Of anything they have, if it be asked for, they never say no, but do rather invite the person to accept it, and show as much lovingness as though they would give their hearts."" Thank goodness capitalism came along and taught them ""life isn't fair"". 

But that's a history we're all mostly vaguely familiar with. What about elswhere? In Germany, where 100,000 people fighting for freedom from capitalism had to be slaughtered for it to be imposed. 

&gt;The development of capitalism was not the only possible response to the crisis of feudal power. Throughout Europe, vast communalistic social movements and rebellions against feudalism had offered the promise of a new egalitarian society built on social equality and cooperation. However, by 1525 their most powerful expression, the Peasant War in Germany was crushed. A hundred thousand rebels were massacred in retaliation. With these defeats, compounded by the spreads of witch-hunts and the effects of colonial expansion, the revolutionary process in Europe came to an end. Military might was not sufficient, however, to avert the [economic] crisis of feudalism.

&gt;It was in response to this crisis that the European ruling class launched the global offensive that in the course of at least three centuries was to change the history of the planet, laying the foundations of a capitalist world-system, in the relentless attempt to appropriate new sources of wealth, expand its economic basis, and bring new workers under its command.

&gt;Silvia Federici

Even in the original land of rich white people, they didn't want it:

&gt;The 1540s saw a crisis in agriculture in England. With the majority of the population depending on the land, this led to outbreaks of unrest across the country. Kett's rebellion in Norfolk was the most serious of these. The main grievance of the rioters was enclosure, the fencing-off of common land by landlords for their own use. Enclosure left peasants with nowhere to graze their animals. Some landowners were forcing tenants off their farms so that they could engross their holdings and convert arable land into pasture for sheep, which had become more profitable as demand for wool increased.[1] Inflation, unemployment, rising rents and declining wages added to the hardships faced by the common people.[2] As the historian Mark Cornwall put it, they ""could scarcely doubt that the state had been taken over by a breed of men whose policy was to rob the poor for the benefit of the rich"".[3]
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kett%27s_Rebellion

This move to capitalism led to the deaths of ~3,000 of 16,000 rebels. 

Re: your jpgs, I believe the worker who does $20-50 dollars of work per hour should keep the whole bunch (rather than $8-15) and give none of it to someone else who hasn't earned it. But that isn't the point of disagreement. Sowell/you believe that the capitalist has earned the right to benefit from someone else's work because he performed the difficult task of creating a business. Effectively the same as saying a thief is entitled to rob your house provided it's difficult enough.

Capitalism is a violent, corrupt mess, and wherever it appears it's unwelcome by everyone but the wealthy.

We have family, property and some business there and we are just waiting to see if this conflict ends to invest more and bring new job opportunities to Odessits. I just came from there from a quick visit a few days ago. The climate there is still tense, but in some way I felt it getting better. Some people that I know who got divided over this conflict are now getting back to talk to each other again. They avoid talking about this, but at least there's a sense of will to co-exist no matter what and that after all they are all just the same, people.

0,False,"I agree athletes are idolized way too much, especially by disadvantaged youth but I think a guy like curry can still help motivate kids to work harder to achieve a goal.  Right now he's just a basketball star to them, if he goes there he's an actual person who can talk about the work it took to get where he is, and how it takes that same amount of work to be successful anywhere.  He could talk about the importance of the opportunity he got at Davidson because of his talent yes, but also his education. 

He grew up privileged no lie, but he didn't grow up with an nba body, he couldn't fuck around in school take bullshit classes at a sec school long enough to stay eligible for the tourney and get drafted. He couldn't go play in China/Europe for a year and be a lottery pick.  If he didn't have the academics to get into Davidson he might not be an nba player right now. 

Honestly if we want to talk about poor and disadvantaged high school students who aren't academically focused it's already too late, this teacher isn't helping them either. 16 is way too late to reach the vast majority of these kids and even if you did, you'd lose most of them when they realized they had years of education to catch up on.  Our system left them behind five years ago, the number who are still functionally illiterate, who don't know basic concepts in math and science, who never developed the habits and discipline that are necessary to succeed in the modern society, who never had stability or role models at home is disgraceful. All he's doing is babysitting kids we largely left behind for a year until a new crop comes in and fills their place. We need to get to these kids when we still have them, when they are excited to go to school and keep them.

0,False,"I think pretty much every response here has some merit to it. Just recently I did a direct deal with a trusted vendor for a personal amount of a little something something--over straight email (he uses safemail, I created a mainstream free email account on TOR, and as long as I'm on an exit node in the ""same"" country as I registered, I can login just fine), we just both used PGP for all communication, and I paid in tumbled BTC. It was super easy, the only real difference between something like this and the way a market works is that it comes down to logistics: you have to have a contact in the first place to do any direct deal, preferably a trusted vendor, which brings about the paradox that good marketplaces with good feedback systems are the best way to establish vendors. So to start any marketplace that is hinged on direct deals I feel would first disillusion users as any feedback system will be inherently flawed, and also direct dealing is probably too complicated in any secure incarnation to be used by the average marketplace enthusiast.

Now I know Ross bawled to the judge about how he never wanted to hurt anyone, I believe DNM's do provide harm reduction. People will always OD, you can count how many got their drugs from a DNM, but you can't know how greatly people benefited from not getting ripped off with something dangerous or tainted (or if they are word spreads quick), and you can't measure how many people didn't die because their drugs weren't cut with something dangerous (or if they were cut to the point of being not deadly concentrated, etc.). The point is, I'm with these European Democratic Socialists when they say drugs are a healthcare issue and criminalizing use makes it worse while encouraging black markets. Well, here's to the black market. Until governments listen to the overwhelming public agreement that cannabis and psychedelics shouldn't be criminalized, I wholeheartedly believe DNM's can play a role in economic disobedience. If I created a DNM today one of my decisions would be: What can be for sale? Besides the obvious prohibitions like cp and weapons, I might choose to also ban drugs that can cause harm/death (opiods, benzos, amphetamines, alkaloids, some pharmaceuticals), maybe I'll write up a manifesto and go full Austrian economics, asking people only to refrain from harm and stay educated. It would be up to me alone.

Now I just registered this lovely throwaway and I don't know if I'll log into it again, so I feel reasonably free to speak my mind. Honestly, a little fantasy of mine is running a TOR service that works like a marketplace. I'm only a student and I don't have the experience yet but I am studying these topics and learning fast, it's fascinating stuff. Ideally I would start from hardware up as I am more experienced building PC's than building servers but every day I can add to that expertise.

I would radically change the scheme in a number of ways conducive to my opinion on the best ways to run a market--multisig is given, an ironclad feedback system, storefronts inspired by the likes of eBay, and security so entrenched that every system is compartmentalized and shielded from the others to minimize points of failure.

I think virtualization is the key here, a huge limitation of hidden services is that they can only be run from a single instance of TOR. That's because TOR can only run off one CPU thread. Solution? Virtualize a single thread machine just to handle the TOR connection, I think whonix is onto something with its handling of hidden services and gateways, so I would probably fashion a foundation on that. My dream is SSD's in some striping as a big cache to handle the common-type web services quickly, then another bunch of SSD's for server-side and backend type stuff, with daily backups to giant HDD's in some parity scheme, and of course everything is separated into dedicated VM's, probably with some extra crypto goodies inside for the sweet redundancy.

However this calls for a localized machine, probably a decent build, and perhaps to separate TOR from the service a second cheap machine can be used to bridge the server to the web so everything anonymous is physically gapped from any contact with anything identifying. It could also use paper wallets with watch-only addresses to hold any coin that needs holding, and maybe even an address can be made public to show all the market's coin in one place (though really it would be much more secure and its private key untouched by the internet).

So a big deal with virtualization is load balancing, which could potentially thwart DDoS attacks depending on their size (or at least defend against them effectively), if the market can run on cheap hardware in different identical servers, maybe all the computing one would need can just serve as a master node, where the main URL points, and so the entire market can shuffle around distributed boxes of maybe raspberry pi's and SSDs sometime in the future, or maybe someone will figure out a way to P2P this entire shebang. Whatever happens, as long as one remains a student, learning things like the importance of hosting your own HSDir nodes, eliminating DNS and other vulnerabilities, we have the upper hand here against even a potential nation-state with capable resources. This is guerrilla warfare, no central government is prepared for this landscape and though they can get their hands on a head or a limb, they will never get every straggler, and they will never make us forget that we have the freedom to provide ourselves freedom. They can seize servers, or millions worth of BTC, but every day this technology innovates, and all we have to do is sit, and wait, and debug our systems, until the day comes that someone figures out the perfect way to host a service, plugs in, and flips the switch.

Moral of the story? Learn to code, if this is your thing. I know I am. The global economy is shaping itself and there are education resources available for any technological dream. Find yours.

Disclaimer: white cishet male. Poor as hell. Northern European.

&gt;I just tend to believe them. The media tends to portray men as essentially cannon fodder for the Grim Reaper as opposed to having anything of value, and the guys I've been surrounded by are usually complete jerks or nerds and/or sound and look like it.

I don't quite understand, is it  a good or a bad thing that men are seen as cannon fodder? Why do you believe the media narrative at all? I kind of get a picture that you are a young person still, and haven't seen much of male behaviour outside of school environment. I can assure you, as people mature, they turn out to be something other than jock/nerd stereotypes. Well, most of them, some people are just assholes. And holy hell can some women be huge assholes too.

&gt;I feel like all the good guys are probably living really comfy upper-middle class lives and even then are pretty self-centred.

Comfy upper-middle guys seem to be more entitled and irritating in my experience. And ""nice guys"" are often ridiculed, so you can see a lot of people trying to be aggressively manly when it doesn't suit them.

&gt;I've read somewhere also how there are women who are capable of being more physically strong and resilient versus guys, even outside of labour.

Don't buy into it. Every time something so general as women versus men comes up, it's feminist (or red pill) propaganda. You simply can't just compare half a population of the earth directly to the other half. There are strong women and strong men, weak women and weak men.

&gt;Sometimes I feel like I want to meet a transman so I can understand that femininity isn't all that pretty. When I read about masculine traits one time, I felt that we're quite naturally ""cold"", so I strived to be more feminine even though I guess it's not in my nature to.

You probably have strong bias against masculinity for some reason. It has good traits just like feminity has. For example, see the traditional father role. A man was expected to pretty much work until death, providing selflessly for his family. Versus a gangbanger going after money and whores. A selfless mother sacrificing her time and body for her children so that they could grow up. Versus an irrational, golddigging psycho woman exploiting everyone. You get the point.

 [**Absurdism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), ""__the Absurd__"" refers to the conflict between (1) the human tendency to seek [inherent value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics\)) and [meaning in life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life) and (2) the human inability to find any. In this context *absurd* does not mean ""logically impossible"", but rather ""humanly impossible"".  The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously.

&gt;Accordingly, __absurdism__ is a philosophical [school of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_thought) stating that the efforts of [humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_race) to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information as well as the vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning. 

&gt;Absurdism, [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism), and [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism) share similar concepts, with common theoretical template and has its origins in the 19th century [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) philosopher [Søren Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard), who chose to confront the crisis humans faced with the Absurd by developing [existentialist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard).  Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when the [French Algerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied-Noir) philosopher and writer [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) rejected certain aspects from that philosophical line of thought  and published his essay *[The Myth of Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus)*. The aftermath of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France).

0,False,"&gt; Yes, yes it was. If individuals didn't default on their obligations, we would not be having this conversation. They were a necessary part of the crash.

Individuals react to the system around them. The very fact that our economy was built off debt to begin with kind of says it all about how fucked the whole shebang is. 

&gt;This is Marxist nonsense. Capitalism does not need poverty. Capitalism merely requires free exchange. You want something, I want something else; we trade. That's capitalism.

Marx was more on the money then a lot of people want to admit. And you're mistaking markets with ownership. Markets are not a feature of capitalism, that's just a method of distribution. Market socialism is a thing. 

And yes, capitalism needs poverty. Why would a rich person decide to clean septic tanks for a living? To work on an assembly line for 12 hours a day doing menial shit he doesn't care about?

[Here's a book on it](https://is.vsfs.cz/el/6410/leto2013/BA_ETD/um/3968033/The_Invention_of_Capitalism.pdf)

&gt;And it has been a massive failure, both in theory and in practice.

Yes, because 2008 was totally not a failure. Because wage stagnation doesn't exist...because America is doing perfectly. 

Fact is America and Europe did good under Keynesianism. We've collapsed into pure greed and dysfunction under neoliberalism. In fact everywhere Friedman reared his bald head chaos followed.

&gt; This is complete bullshit. The greatest gains for the common man occurred during the periods of time in which the economic system in place was most closely described as ""capitalist.""

Only when it was highly regulated and social programs were in place. Which says a lot, it takes government intervention to make capitalism even somewhat livable. And the funny thing is even then it kind of sucks. In fact in any circumstances somebody has to be living like shit in order for capitalism to function. Either a factory worker in the US or China, somebody has to be at the bottom rung. 

Human ingenuity isn't tied to private ownership of property, I might add. Most corporate CEOs are good at crunching numbers but fucking horrible at everything else, you'll notice. 

&gt;You can't be fucking serious. Ever heard of regulatory capture? It's the exact opposite of what you described. Corporations are writing more rules, not getting rid of old ones.

They want the government to work for them. Which is a natural result of the concentration of money and political influence at the top of the economic pyramid scheme. Funny thing, Marx and various leftist and anarchist writers have been saying it's the case for over a century. They've been over it again and again, a democracy cannot survive intact alongside a capitalist system. The funny thing is the political right always has the same response when coming face to face with this reality, which is to pretend the answer is *more* capitalism, which is just fucking absurd. 

&gt;Once again you've shown a complete lack of understanding of basic economics.

Go down to a local homeless shelter, you'll see it yourself. 

&gt; but free trade is always win-win.

Seriously? Do you know how many Mexican farmers are currently living in the US and working shit jobs because NAFTA ruined their livelihoods? Don't act like the playing field is even, it isn't. Never was. Never will be. The ""free market"" is a fucking myth. 

&gt;No, cronyism

Capitalism is cronyism by default. 

&gt;sorely misinformed people are the problem.

I agree. Case and point, you thinking neoliberalism benefits everybody while ignoring those Mexican farmers who's entire livelihood and tradition has been obliterated in the name of corporate profit and ""free trade""

&gt;The freedom to do business as you see fit would solve the problem

Business is not moral. Business is not fair. Business does not play by the rules. 

Do you really think human greed is a self regulating force? Seriously? 

When Adam Smith wrote of the ""invisible hand"" he was literally talking about god. 

Well I don't know about you, but I don't think god gives a fuck about your business. The world is chaotic and human beings even moreso.

0,False,"&gt;What armour? 

It depends on which armour you are talking about. [Full corrugated Gothic or Italian Maximilian armour](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Zbroja_1514.JPG) weighed more (70-85lb) than [regular plate armour](http://blog.blantonmuseum.org/files/2013/11/ArmorAngle.jpg) (30-60lb). Regular plate armour is still much [less mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UbOdyn_Us) than Japanese armour (50lb), but both armours offer the same amount of  effective protection. [Keith Duclin of the Royal Armouries is London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWmaLnMlXE) states that the Japanese armour is much more mobile (I'm paraphrasing. Watch the video to understand better). And while I trust everyone's opinions, its hard to refute a guy who's sole profession is to move around in and study different types of armour in England's Royal Armouries. Especially, after watching the other video of men moving around in plate armour.

When you are talking about armoured fighting its really not about whether a sword can get through or not. Its really about two things: 1) who can knock the other person down and 2) who fights better on the ground. You can [watch the whole video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmDER4qovS8)) but my point starts at 8 mins. Both cultures did not just beat each other senseless until the armour failed. Fights went to the ground.

The Japanese samurai were all educated and literate (without question). The same cannot be said for all knights throughout Europe. The passing down of martial arts knowledge was very important in Japanese culture. On average (considering all of Europe and language barriers vs the one country of Japan), I would say that the samurai were better at take-down techniques, ground fighting, submissions, and ground killing (the samurai did not offer mercy as much as knights did) than the European knight counter part. While European martial arts are just as effective as Japanese martial arts, the likelihood that proper training and schooling were given on average would on average favor the samurai. It is such that [yoroi kumiuchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTY36v1jT4Q) (armoured unarmed fighting) is still a commonly practiced martial art and [Yagyū Shingan-ryū](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagy%C5%AB_Shingan-ry%C5%AB) is still taught from its original form. Where its European counterpart, while practiced, is not as organized; and must draw from several sources, each from different cultures, in different languages (its hard to even find video of plate armoured unarmed fighting). Even with the height, weight, strength, and armour durability advantage; armoured fighting favors the faster and the better technique. 

If there is no armour, then the knight has the advantage as the katana is overall a faster sword than most European ""broadswords"" regardless of single or two hand hold. There is no armour, so the first sword strike wins.

&gt;What battlefield? 

This matters. 75% of the earth is water. If this is an[ armoured fight in water, the samurai wins 10/10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwDvJeP4WOg). If this is an armoured fight in the desert, I would still favor the samurai. Samurai armour can be taken on and off by the wearer, most European knight armours cannot. Is the ground muddy? Japanese footwear was much better in muddy conditions than European footwear. I understand my examples are somewhat ludicrous, but I'm simply stating that the battlefield plays a big role in this fight.

&gt;What time period?

If this is 1000-1400, then the European knight has an advantage over the Samurai. If it is the most advanced knight (1437) vs the most advanced samurai (1878), then I'm going to say the samurai. 

&gt;Also, who are the combatants?

Are these just random warriors? Because Miyamoto Musashi was a real person, and would have a slight advantage over any random hedge knight. I'm not familiar with any real actual legendary knights. It seems that knights do not stay tournament winners for very long. There are so many different cultures in Europe, that picking an ideal knight is not straight forward. You would probably want an Anglo Saxon, in German or Italian armour, with French or Spainish training. At that point you would be taking the best of all Europe had to offer and jamming it into a fictional person. A regional knight or Prince from Germany or Italy would be the closest real person to a European champion.

I'm simply stating that it's ridiculous to call someone out for something... *and then proceed to do that exact same thing* regardless of nationality. 

It's akin to saying, ""Racism is wrong. But fuck that stupid black bitch."" 

&gt; You're an American yourself, so I don't expect you to understand the subtleties of how continental Europeans communicate [...]

Listen to yourself. You sound like such a self-important, smug asshole. Look, the people who posted those comments are rude, bitchy and idiotic. But they're probably also frustrated living in a completely alien culture and they're probably the type A people who are annoying as fuck in the US, too. There's no need to fight rudeness with rudeness just to be 2 edgy. 

&gt; I don't think an American lady like yourself would ever begin to understand what I was trying to say with my generalization on American women, simply because you were raised to consider the sort of behaviour that I (amongst others) think is self-important, to be normal behaviour. 

Pot, meet kettle. Your whole rant here is self-important and holier-than-thou. ""Me European, me smart. You American, you dumb!""

A brief look at your comment history on the very first page turns this little gem up:

edit: so I hit wiki up wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism

The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (German: Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus) is a book written by Max Weber, a German sociologist, economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by Talcott Parsons in 1930.[1] It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general.


In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence[2] of modern capitalism. This idea is also known as the ""Protestant Ethic thesis.""[3]


In 1998 the International Sociological Association listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century.[4]

0,False,"I quit a long time ago, and have started checking this subreddit again trying to see what I can expect from LotV. Prepare for a longer response than is probably worth posting, but oh well. My experience with Starcraft is as follows:

Loved playing SC and BW as a kid. Just the campaigns, though, I never touched multiplayer. I'm not even sure I knew multiplayer was a thing -- none of my friends played multiplayer either. In college I discovered the Korean BW scene, and watched every event I could (along with the entire archive on GOMtv and all the Proleague/Starleague/etc games I could find with English commentary). I still never actually played SC against humans, but loved the idea of it. I was fairly a active poster on TL from 2007-2013 or so. 

When SC2 came out, I got it shortly after release. Played through the campaign until I had all the achievements on Brutal, then decided to give ladder a try. It was pretty fun, although I was definitely not good at it at all. I was in gold for a while, then in platinum for about a year. During that time I would play maybe 2-3 ladder games a week, but watched tons of tournaments/streams. It was incredibly demotivating to hear from every source that if you weren't high Masters (preferably on EU/KR) then you were utter shit and didn't even deserve to voice opinions on the game, but at the same time I understood why that's a reasonable position to take if you want a game to succeed as a competitive sport. 

Then slowly but surely grad school started taking more of my time, so I watched streams less, so I knew less of what was going on with the game, so I played less, so I read about the game less, and so on. Every time I felt like I should try playing ladder again, I decided against it because it felt like I was too out of practice to even try to practice. What's the point of playing a game you're terrible at for hours and hours and hours hoping to eventually become... slightly less terrible? I'm pretty sure the last time I played a real ladder game, Tal'Darim Altar was still in the map pool and PvP was all about how precise your 4 Gate was. 

When HoTS came out, I played the campaign, and never touched multiplayer. I don't even know how the HoTS units work. I'm probably going to do the same thing with LotV. Maybe I'll try ladder again? I'd like to, and I'd like to play Random to get a solid understanding of how all the matchups work, but if I'm honest with myself I probably won't. It's a time commitment thing. Starcraft is not fun unless you're pretty good at it, and you can't be pretty good at it unless you're serious about it. I have enough other things going on in my life that I don't think it's realistic for me to devote enough energy to SC to become competent. As I said earlier, once you drift away, it gets harder and harder to come back. I don't even know how I'd start to get back into it, and as fun as it would probably be, it doesn't seem worth the time and effort. I still have it installed, but if I were to open HoTS right now and hit that Find Match button, I would have no idea what I was supposed to do. If I were to turn on a stream, I'm certain I would have no idea what I was looking at as far as builds and timings and counters and stuff.

I like the idea of Starcraft because of the history of the game and the possibility of these complex strategic mindgames. But if you don't have Masters level mechanics drilled into your muscle memory, that's not what Starcraft is in practice. In practice, it's not two people having a furious battle of wits until someone executes a clever strategic/tactical maneuver that wins the game, in practice it's two people mashing buttons until someone makes one too many game-losing mistakes and ends the comedy of errors they're trying to pass off as a strategy game. Maybe I'm getting too old and just don't have the manual dexterity for a competitive RTS. I love high-level chess and high-level Magic, but I'm pretty sure I only love the *idea* of high-level Starcraft. Mediocre Starcraft is not appealing, and the gulf between the two seems impossibly wide. As a result, I'll dick around in the campaign for a while, half-heartedly wish I were good enough at SC to enjoy ladder, and then put it away with a sad smile.",0,starcraft,False,1433298963,1,1436683437,,1,False,,crtqou5,t1_crt16hb,t5_2qpp6,,0,,t3_387a8b,wintermute93,t1_crtqou5
