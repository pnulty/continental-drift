But let's actually address this. I am not pro-Communism. Communism is an ideology in which all property is publicly owned, there is no money, and there is somehow magically no state despite the fact that a massive central government is required to actually distribute resources in a moneyless society. It is a ridiculous, naive, unimplementable fairy tale utopia at best, and IMO the idea of having ALL property be communal is an affront to human dignity.

However, I suspect that you are using ""commie"" as a slur for any vaguely left-wing economic idea you disagree with, possibly including shit like labor safety laws and a minimum wage. So, since I support a more European-like economic system where higher taxes with a progressive bracket system are used to maintain an extensive social safety net, I'm going to go ahead and say that by your definition, I am ""pro-commie.""",,HotDealsInTexas,t1_dd5rtl4,MensRights,dd61hy7,,1488453606,False,t5_2qhk3,False

It's interesting you can see that as an over-reaction, but you can't see how the previous statement is also an over-reaction. In fact, you seem to double down on the approach calling people who want controlled immigration ""xenophobic prejudices"", and in general you also seem to claim that calling those you disagree with ""Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic - you name it!"" is simply accuracy.

I suggest to you that they are both the same thing... feeding each other.

&gt;And we also seem to agree that this is what the Trump phenomenon is all about: Media attention.

We don't agree here, really. The ""Media Attention"" that fuels Trump is the way that about 90% of the media has gone off-the-rails-crazy about Trump and are desperate to paint him as a dictator... the story line you do seem to see and the one we do agree on. The obvious bias and hyperbole from the media, fed by the absolute certainty that anyone who disagrees with them is ""Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic - you name it!"" is what gives Trump his power.

&gt;And even /r/moderatepolitics has joined in.

I wasn't here for the Romney campaign, so I can't really say if the subreddit treated him differently than they treat Trump.

My experience in America and other subreddits is that Romney was called all the same things... but it wasn't Obama saying it - it was his surrogates.

&gt;Why is that? I am still trying to make sense of it all.

I think you have the answer, you just refuse to accept that it is all connected. You see this one part as hyperbolic and histrionic reaction... but don't see how it is a culmination of hyperbolic and histrionic reactions that have reached a crescendo of ""Us vs. Them"" and ""We are good and they are evil"" political philosophy.

Now I will also admit ; Trump taps into that on the right like nobody's business. Like you said before, he grabbed that Birther conspiracy and nominated himself as leader...

And the same ""Us vs. Them"" and ""We are good and they are evil"" political philosophy that created Birtherism has now created ""Trump is Putin's puppet"" or ""Trump is Bannon's Puppet"" or ""Russia stole the election""... etc etc.

It's the same political philosophy that we saw from those on the right, only it is coming from the left.

And I also propose to you that it is much more prevalent on the left than birtherism ever was on the right. And why wouldn't it be? The nominee for the Presidency on the left is saying everyone who disagrees with her is ""Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic - you name it!""... why wouldn't everyone who voted for her say the same thing? Why would they have any restraint?

I think you have made sense of it, you are just also in the ""Well that's because I am good and the others are evil"" mentality.

And if I do a fast search of Der Spiegel... it does seem like some of the articles are about a Refugee problem, while others seem to be very supportive of Merkel and the policy.

My attempt to discuss that with you was to honestly talk about the problems. Like this article that describes refugees from Africa using Italy as a springboard to head to Germany:

http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/italy-refugee-problem-spells-trouble-for-europe-a-1131506.html

This would be analogous to Central and South Americans who use Mexico as a springboard for illegal entry to the US:

http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/06/05/318905712/riding-the-beast-across-mexico-to-the-u-s-border

http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-shows-signs-of-strain-from-mass-of-refugees-a-1058237.html

Now I agree, it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. Some articles talk about how well people are adjusting too...

But the idea that there is no strain seems demonstrably wrong, regardless if we focus on Germany, the EU, or Europe in it's entirety.

And an honest recognition of the problems that come with the policy is what I was trying to discuss... and when I read your last two paragraphs first? It seems like you are saying there are no problems at all.

I disagree with it because I've been led there by prayer and introspection, but I'm not bright enough to refute it (although others are). 

That said, I love when Protestants cite natural law theory to satisfy their need to invalidate homosexuals and then go back to bashing those crazy Catholics and their Saint-worship. Personally, putting myself in a conservative's shoes, I think I'd find the scriptural references to homosexuality more convincing than natural law theory even as a Catholic. It's less messy. I personally reject both of these arguments, but the natural law rests on some premises that can be contested much more easily than the scriptures can.

Sort of a tangent, but we were talking in my European history class about how Aristotle's conclusions about the ""natural state"" of things were first questioned when people came in to contact with non-European people and realized that some of those universal truths were not as universal as they thought, and this helped set off the enlightenment because people started to question their traditional sources of intellectual authority. I know ""enlightenment"" is a dirty word in Christian circles, but the Euro-centrism of a lot of Christian thought is pretty troubling.

&gt; Gorguts are a technical death metal/avant-garde metal band that formed in 1989 in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.  They have released five full-length albums to date, and released their first EP 'Pleiades' Dust' in 2016, which consists of a single 33-minute song. The band has experienced numerous lineup changes and musical transformations since their inception, with founding guitarist/vocalist Luc Lemay being the only remaining founding member. In 2005, following the suicide of drummer Steve MacDonald, the band broke up. Lemay later revived the band and returned with Colored Sands in 2013 and a new lineup featuring Colin Marston, Kevin Hufnagel, and John Longstreth.

&gt; The original lineup of the band featured Luc Lemay (guitar/vocals), Sylvain Marcoux (guitar), Eric Giguere (bass) and Stephane Provencher (drums) in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. They recorded a demo in 1990 entitled ...and Then Comes Lividity, and then in 1991 released Considered Dead on Roadrunner, their first full-length album. The release featured a guest guitar solo by James Murphy and guest vocals by Chris Barnes. Two years later in 1993, they released their second full-length, entitled The Erosion of Sanity. Similar in style to their debut, this album had showed Gorguts had indeed developed in musicianship. However, this album was overlooked and became an unheard classic for many years.

&gt; The band fell silent for five years. Many assumed Gorguts was no more, until 1998 when Luc Lemay unveiled a new lineup and unleashed a classic in avant-garde death metal, Obscura, which many will agree is the most technical, chaotic and downright lucid metal album ever recorded. Filled with irregular beats, discordant riffing, and complex song arrangements, Obscura turned out to be either indigestible by many, or seen for its true beauty by few. Three years later, Gorguts returned once again with From Wisdom to Hate. Some consider this release to be a digression from Obscura, but it was still much in the same avant-garde/technical vein. Dan Mongrain of Martyr was recruited for the second guitarist on this album, contributing to the writing process and lead guitar work as well.

&gt; After being out of print for many years, Roadrunner Records re-released their first two albums on a single disc, and Galy Record re-released their 1990 demo along with many other demo tracks throughout the years. In October 2002, drummer Steve MacDonald hanged himself after suffering from years of depression. The band split up in 2005 and reformed in 2008.

&gt; As of December 2008, a demo track of Gorguts featuring guitar and programmed drums which was previously unheard by the public surfaced online, and Lemay himself confirmed an upcoming reunion featuring Colin Marston, Kevin Hufnagel and John Longstreth. While the new Gorguts has been performing live and writing new material, Lemay stated that the band would not be entering the studio until the ""late fall"" of 2010.
 
The band is currently signed to Season of Mist. The band's fifth album, Colored Sands, was released on August 30, 2013, although it was released digitally a month earlier after a leak of the material online. A concept album about the history of Tibet, Colored Sands was rapturously received in many publications and appeared in many year-end best-of lists. The band cited Porcupine Tree and Opeth as influences on the album's lengthier compositions, as well as Dmitri Shostakovich and Krzysztof Penderecki on its neoclassical string interlude ""The Battle of Chamdo"".

&gt; In 2014, John Longstreth, whose schedule with Origin was incompatible with Gorguts, departed the band. His replacement, Patrice Hamelin, had already been performing live with Gorguts since 2011. In 2015, Obscura, which had been out of print on CD for decades, was re-released by both Century Media and Season of Mist. It also received a new vinyl pressing from Season of Mist (it had previously been released on vinyl by War on Music). Century Media also reissued From Wisdom to Hate (also previously released on vinyl by War on Music) on vinyl. A two-CD set of both albums was issued by Mazzar Records in 2016.

&gt; The band's first EP, Pleiades' Dust, was officially released on May 13, 2016. A concept album about the House of Wisdom in Baghdad during Europe's Dark Ages, it consists of a single track divided into seven movements. The band cited Deathspell Omega as a musical influence this time around. Reception thus far has been almost unanimously positive.

1. he might be breaking the law and not be paying any of the required tourism tax.
2. he is kinda breaking the requirement but on his own terms complying with the 'idea' behind the requirement.

I'm more of number 2. I don't require a copy of an ID, even though the local authorities require the information it gives. I will start doing it if I'm told off by the authorities but for now it doesn't seem they care I don't have complete addresses..  The tourism form asks of me: the date of arrival, date of leaving, how many people, how many beds, age and address of the place they live. Why do they ask these things? For one, if an inhabitant of my own municipality stays at my Airbnb, I won't have to pay tourism tax, for everyone else it has to be paid. They ask the age because there are two rates, one for an adult and the other for primary school aged children that are traveling as a part of a school activity (that don't live in the municipality, of course), so kids traveling with their parents don't get the discount. So my take is, that they need it to verify if the exceptions apply. So far I haven't had any of the exceptions. Instead of the complete address I just use the place of residence their profile mentions, the problem is when they don't mention it in the profile, I'll have some extra work asking them.

Another reason they might be requiring us to collect this information is for comprehensive statistics on the local tourism sector.

When I first started out I thought I was required to fill it in for every individual, which is a lot of work since I rent out to groups up to 14 people.

I'm not sure it really is that unique, but good enough on average. It's a lucky coincidence we're also the Zerglings of Europe, having ~82 million people there's a larger pool of every kind of professional if we assume the per citizen rates are roughly equal.

&gt; Germany did a similar thing and invested billions into industry in the East after the fall of the GDR in order to benefit the country - it's not a new or unprecedented idea.

This is something Germans from the former GDR still get to hear about today, how they ""owe"" the western Germans. Even if it's bullshit. It was so controversial that some people still have anger over it and those were Germans, not foreigners.

I'm very sure the European countries aren't close enough to each other for that to happen, it would be impossible to sell that idea to most people.

Even the countries on the receiving end would resist. Don't forget whenever anything happens involving Germany the Nazi caricatures of German politicians/people are instantly on several front pages across Europe even if it doesn't fit what's happening at all.

It's just the default reaction and they would think we bought their governments or something like that to finally proclaim the 4th Reich. Of course most people know better, but if you get a couple million really riled up it's enough to cause a lot of chaos.

There just doesn't seem to be enough trust in either direction for that to happen. With recent developments I'd even say it's gotten worse, the ""got mine, fuck you"" mentality is/was growing in several countries. It might be an option that works, but I doubt we'll ever see it happen in my lifetime.

At least not to a much larger degree than the net paying we do in the EU, as somebody else pointed out. In Germany we say ""Bei Geld hört die Freundschaft auf."", it roughly translates to ""Friendship ends when it's about money."" I think that's a pretty universal fact around the world, we wish everybody the best as long as it doesn't cost us a cent.

I agree though things like veteran suicide, mental health and homelessness rates are pretty shocking considering how high the US regards it's military. Unfortunately most of your unemployment issues are structural (i.e the sectors where people are trained are no longer needed) which not even Trump can save, because they've been given up to Automated machines, so even if he brought back the car manufacturers the people who used to work there would have to retrain and there still wouldn't be a job for everybody who used to work.

&gt; How many branches of Christianity are there? How do they differ from one another?

Well here's the thing about that. There's big branches and little branches coming off the big ones. I'm *really* gonna be giving you the nutshell version. The main divisions are: 

**Roman Catholic-** These are the people with the Pope. They've got highly ritualized services, and have centuries upon centuries of theology, philosophy, and dogma. The claim to the be One True Church. 

**Eastern Orthodox-** Like Roman Catholics, except they reject the idea of having a Pope. Also have centuries upon centuries of theology, philosophy, and dogma, some of which is a little off from Catholicism. Also they're big into beards.

**Protestant-** So in the early 1500s (until I *believe* the mid 1600s, could be wrong) there was a period of time called the Reformation. Up until that time in Western Europe there was pretty much only Roman Catholicism. The Orthodox Church was/is much more of an Eastern thing. 

The summary? This guy named Martin Luther wrote up a long list of all the things that were pissing him off about the Catholic Church and it kind of got out of hand. There was also this guy named John Calvin that stirred the pot a bit, but we're doing a summary here.

Long and short of it? The ""Lutheran"" domination came into being. These guys have centuries of philosophy, theology, and dogma, but they're less ornate when it comes to making ritual of services, though there is some variance here and some Lutheran churches are more fancy than others.

Also the Church of England came to be because the King wanted an annulment, which the Pope refused to give him, so he said ""Fuck you, I'm the bloody Pope now!"" and declared himself head of the Church in England. Honestly I'm not even making that up. Thats pretty much what happened.

Then you have Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Charismatics... there's a lot of different kinds of Protestants.  

Lastly, there's the semi-permeable line that divides groups like Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses from the rest of Christianity because a good number of Christians *dont* consider them Christians for various reasons. Mormons and JWs *do* consider themselves Christians, but they have some WAY different beliefs about God, humans, etc. 

Mormons are borderline polytheist, at the very least monolatrists, just to give you an example. JWs believe the Archangel Michael and Jesus are the same person, and so Jesus isn't God but an angelic being, for another. JWs are often accused of being a cult, which I believe they are in the academic sense of the term.  

Also Mormons have the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrines and Covenants... which are additional scriptures. All other Christians outright reject these Mormon scriptures. Vehemently.

&gt; How many versions of the Bible are there (And where can I get these versions)

One. It contains the Old Testament (Jewish Scriptures) and the New Testament (Four Gospels, a bunch of letters written by St. Paul to various churches, an end of the world prophecy, the Book of Acts, and some other stuff as well). 

There's also a group of books called the [Apocrypha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_apocrypha) which is included by Catholics and such but excluded by most protestants, but the Catholics don't treat these books the way they treat the rest of scripture.

There's also a ton of different translations of the Bible. The King James Bible is one of the biggies.  

There's also a smaller sect in Ethiopia the accepts a book called Enoch, and I'm sure there are a few other variances, but largely speaking... one version, which semi-includes the books of the Apocrypha, with many translations. 

&gt; Is there any branch of Christianity which doesn't believe in the divinity of Jesus?

Yes. Many Christians won't consider these people Christians, though. From a ""Religious Studies"" point of view, they're Christians...or might as well be, because we end up talking about them anyway, depending on the person's opinion. 

&gt; I believe that Christians and Muslim's have the same God, Allah being the Arabic word for God. I've met some Christians who believe Muslim's either worship a false God, the moon or a demon. Do you believe that Christians and Muslim's believe in the same God?

Its my informed opinion, but an opinion nonetheless, that Jews, Muslims, and Christians all worship the same deity, but can't agree on what that deity is like.

Some Christians think the Bible is literally true in every way. This leads them to refusing reason and science.

t3_5r5y0d,0,1485911776,,1,0,"Either way I could go on and on. In response the Cultural Marxists decided to embark upon the ‘long march through the institutions’ as Antonio Gramsci suggested. Moa Zedong ironically called his revolution the ‘long march’. Through this radicalization of the perceived oppressed they could finally instigate Marx’s revolution in the West. Race is but one factor which was necessary to bring under their control and they did this through the use of Critical Theory which is the foundation of all race and gender studies but has spread throughout our educational institutions teaching Whites about the atrocities of their racial past. Simultaneously telling them race does not exist, in the name of equality, then planting seeds of self-hatred and hostility towards their ‘ignorant’ ancestors.

The White privilege myth comes out of this devastating Cultural Revolution in the Western world. Which has resulted in the widespread use of accusing opponents on the right of being Nazis, Fascists, xenophobes, bigots, racists, or nativist for believing what had always been believed by all people in all of history and is still believed by all except White Westerners today. This is why we are to have affirmative action, anti-discrimination laws, social restriction upon speech (Negro/Black is now African American, Indian is now Native American, retard is now mentally disabled, etc…)

Because of this we must also invite in hordes of third world immigrants into our nations which are suffering a reduction in population, which Socialists say is a good thing, due to policies regarding contraception, family life, feminism, rising crime, and decline in national unity. To supplement this we import millions of poor third world peoples with low IQs, possible diseases, inclination to violent crime, and high birth rates leading to an inevitable demographic crisis. In the meantime we cannot assimilate them, for that is violating their freedom, nor can we turn them away because that is racist. It is White nations and only White nations which must hand over their lands to invaders with a smile on their face or be condemned and in some European nations; fined or imprisoned.

The conclusion is simple. White privilege is a myth created by left-wing lunatics hoping to foment a Marxist Revolution or at least dramatically alter our culture because of a mass indoctrination which tells all White people their ancestors were evil, they must repent for their thought crimes, limit their speech or face social ostracism, happily hand over their lands, and recite the mantra: “There is no so thing as race. Race is a social construct. This social construct was created for the maintenance of privilege for White people.

Point taken, though that kind of revelry isn't my thing either haha.

&gt;I'm sure there's plenty of Canadians that don't want to take chances with terrorism seeping into their country.

This is literally one of the goals of terrorism. To instill an attitude of fear. To act out of fear in this way is to let them win, in my opinion. They don't want America (or Canada) to be welcoming to Muslims, they want to be the only option for a Muslim looking to better their life.

I want us to prove them wrong, emphatically. I hate the thought that IS is a more attractive option than America is to *anyone.* I want us to admit that we have failed to welcome the refugees we already have any more than the bare minimum, and welcome people like never before.

Notice I have said nothing about forgiveness for the terrorists, or thinking that American deaths are ""worth it"" (what a horrible thought, ugh). I have faith that the millions of Muslims here who have never harmed anyone will step up if we give them a platform rather than intimidating and insulting them indiscriminately like many assholes do.

&gt;Europe has knowingly let in terrorists and people that expect Europe to embrace middle eastern culture rather than immigrated to Europe to embrace European culture.

Out of all the systems I collect for, the PlayStation 3 has become my favorite. The wide availability of triple A and niche titles really appeals to me. Now that prices for the games have been dropping off (with a few exceptions), I've been at least acquiring a new game every week. 

With that being said, some games in my collection have taken me years to find while some weren't hard at all. Rarity is hard to determine for PS3 games even though the system has been out for over 10 years. I feel that given a few more years, titles will become harder to find so if you want to enter the realm of collecting for the PS3, THIS IS THE TIME. 

Anyway, out of all the games I have, the ones I will mention below have been the most difficult for me to locate, online and out in the wild. Imports will not count!

The Dutch far right was founded by gay people (Pim Fortyn), and he feels that pandering to Islam means giving up all the gains that liberalism made for gay people and is making the life of gay people more dangerous.

The issue with all these things (racism, sexism, and so on) is that if you arn't the target of prejudice at the cliff face, it is easy to dismiss people's fears. 

For example I have some friends of Indian descent who voted Leave because they were subject to racism from eastern europeans. But when I mentioned it in a thread I was downvoted by white middle class people who claimed they had never seen rascism from eastern europeans. Well of *course* they hadn't seen it, they wouldn't have been the target, they were white.

That a bit of a tricky thing to filter out. Much like what the mod has stated, it's very hard to even define the word ""political.""

Another issue that I have ( and this might be a personal distinction), but I do see a difference between, for example, a video from The Nerd Writer about ""how Donald trump creates a sentence"" versus a video from some news source that talks about ""the evils of Islam, and how it is destroying France""

The first video is political in that it has a political figure as the main subject, but then the video shifts and is mainly focused on his speech patterns instead of the 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of his message. I see it as more of an analytical video than a political one. (Though I admit that it is rare, or even impossible, to have these videos be pure with no bias). 

Compare that to the second video about the politics of Islam in Europe which more-or-less will give you an angry or uneasy feeling after watching it regardless of your pre-existing views. It will get conservatives mad about what Muslims are doing, and have liberals mad about a hateful message attacking Muslims. It clearly has a controversial message that it is trying to push, and leading to a lot of fighting and stress in the comment section.

But, of course I am probably showing my own bias since maybe the NerdWriter's video might have made some Trump Supporters as mad as I was when I watched the Islam video, so this distinction between my analytical and my political videos could be very arbitrary. 

---

I think that this is an important question that this sub needs to answer soon, as it is reaching the 50,000 subscribers mark, where a larger portion of readers will up-vote or down-vote any political-esque video based solely on their own political leanings, and not based on the content of the videos which could lead to one ideology or another ""taking over"" this amazing subreddit for their platform, pushing the non-political people away.

I don't have a solution to fix this dilemma, nor do I think there is a magic bullet to fix this, but I do hope that the content culture that has been fostered in this subreddit will continue to be amazing and show me long-form videos that would've never seen otherwise.",,TheMustangKingdom,t3_5r7fkm,mealtimevideos,dd69frx,,1488457741,False,t5_32abf,False

Though I do not agree with Ferguson's contentions, he does identify problems that need to be fixed.

t3_5r9s8l,0,1485918910,tranarchistshadow,3,0,"It's a shame the ""Anarchists"" in Planescape are just illegalists who want to destroy other factions because they don't like organisation. It basically just plays into the bomb-throwing stereotypes. Fortunately there are plenty of other factions which are good. And other RPGs which are very sympathetic to anarchism like Vampire and Eclipse Phase. Hell, I'm GMing a Fallout campaign at the moment with an Anarchist faction that the players are being really supportive of, they seem to want to work with them instead of the other ones. 

I like how you handled alignment, including Neutral on the Law/Chaos spectrum as possible Anarchists for the reasons you did.  Also A+ on including Daoism. Something I think that's worth bringing up is slavery. Some societies would have slavery and Anarchists are pretty stanch abolitionists, something you could have in a campaign as a strong focus. In general I think it's better to try to focus the idea of it being more anti-hierarchy than just anti-states. Especially because nation states don't exist in a Medieval/Early Modern Era.

Obviously the core ideas have been around for a long time (primitive communism and all that) but I'd be very hesitant to apply so many modern Leftist ideas to a presumably Late Medieval/Early Modern Period. Communism and Anarchism as more concrete ideologies emerged during the Industrial Revolution because of the circumstance of the time. Not that similar ideas didn't exist before, but there are reasons behind them being the ideas we know today. If you've read The Communist Manifesto, it talks about how Capitalism more less came into existence. Nation States didn't come into existence until the 18th Century and while the Mercantilism of the Early Modern Period was definitely a precursor, Capitalism also didn't exist. Instead I'd take more of a look at the Peasants Revolt and Wat Tyler and John Ball sort of folks. And Robin Hood. I mean, does revolutionary syndicalism make sense in an agrarian society? If you're making something set during an industrial revolution, sure. But a pre-industrial society, not really because Trade Unions wouldn't have a reason to exist.

Something I think would be very useful is an example (not a strict, this is how you must do it but giving people an idea) of how an Anarchist community would work in such a setting. So day to day life, societal organisation, justice, culture, interaction with other communities, etc.  How would an anarchist community differ from a feudalistic one? And how would a single village be different than a federation of villages/towns/cities? A lot of this depends on culture roo, I mean a culture based on Inuit or Egyptian societies would be very different from your typical Medieval Europe kind of thing.

t3_5qer5e,0,1485919056,,2,0,"First off there are cars following him, I know this could just be dismissed as paranoia without witnessing it but I have seen it for myself. 

The cars are all late model (new), always grey, and all of the ""white goods on wheels"" type of cars (nothing sporty or European, mostly Kia's). This could mean nothing up in the city where he lives, but down here in my town, those type of cars are well out of place.

For late model cars, they look well maintained except for one common problem--they have a light out. Before I had seen this for myself, I thought this might be a common problem with the relays on these cars, but when it is happening at the frequency it does--there is more to this than faulty relays.

Another issue he attributes to gangstalking is people from the past are ""just popping in"" to visit. For some perspective: I have known this guy for 20 years, not lost contact at all during that time (unlike these NPC's from the past that are turning up) and live in a different town an hour away. I was dating a girl who lived on his street for a while and at no point did I ever feel compelled to ""just pop in"" when I was up there. I'd call or text at least, not ""oh I was just in the area"". Yet people he hasnt seen, and cut out of his life 10+ years ago are just turning up at his doorstep unnanounced. Not much more I can add to this because I havnt seen it myself.

Another thing he mentions is related to his business activities, he is a signwriter and has been requested for quotes in some strange situations. As with the people turning up, I have not witnessed this myself, but as someone who hasoperated a business, these are some weird quotes--and none have turned into jobs.

Most of these quotes are at totally empty offices or factory units, and the story is always the same: ""we're just starting up"". But there is nobody actually doing anything and there is no equipment, not even a PC. I know people do start businesses, but normally they invest in some sort of productivity tools before seeking a signwriter.

The people that ask for the quotes are all ""similar"" too. He really noticed this when one of these ""startups"", that was supposedly an accountancy firm, had people from his description: ""none of them were accountants, they looked more like cult members..."" he explained their actions and approach, and I'm just WTF. I am use to weird people, but these folk sounded strange.

He had an actual job near there a few weeks later and decided to stop in, see if he could talk to the same person who ordered the quote. There is no accountancy firm there.

After a few months of us digging (I was interested and kept me away from ME's) we found a gangstalking firm located in this state. We found that they are very well politically connected, we dont know if thay are the ones doing this, but I really doubt they would have much competition here.

Yes, this company can he hired to gaslight anyone--I really questioned the organizational level of this when I was first told about it, after finding this firm (and they have no website) I was fully convinced gangstalking happens on a commercial level.

t3_5rb1qz,0,1485919063,,1,0,"In 2011, the US Congress passed a law allowing citizens of 38 nations to visit the US for up to 90 days without a visa. These countries were (I believe) primarily European. The Obama administration received intelligence that ISIS was looking to take Europeans, train them in the Middle East, send them back to Europe, and then have them carry out attacks in Europe and the US.

As a result of this intelligence, the Obama administration ordered that anyone from those 38 nations who had visited one of the 7 countries on this list after March 2011, then they would be required to go through the standard visa process. That is the origin of this list of 7. It has ZERO effect on anyone who lived in or tried to travel to the US from those countries who would have had to go through the standard visa process anyways.

It is also important to note that Trump's claim that Obama signed a similar executive order to his is also completely wrong. The EO Trump is referencing paused the processing of Iraqi refugee applications for 6 months because two Iraqi refugees had been arrested on terror charges (the only refugees in US history to be arrested on terror charges). The pause was to review the procedures for vetting refugees and strengthen them where possible (which they did). It did not ban anyone who had been granted refugee status from entering the US, merely delayed the approval of existing and new applications.

So in short, Trump found a list of countries that had something to do with terrorism generated by the Obama administration, banned everyone traveling from them (including LPRs) and then claimed Obama had done the same thing.

EDIT: It's also worth noting that there were Iraqi interpreters who were promised refugee status in exchange for their help died while waiting for the applications to be processed as a result of the pause.",,Trek47,t1_dd63pf8,worldnews,dd6b2hr,,1488458601,False,t5_2qh13,1485919565

I'll start with my nightly routine:

I rinse my face with warm water and use La Roche-Posay medicated face cleanser with 2% salicylic acid (it's pricey but its very effective for me).

After drying my face I apply Aargan Facial Grape seed oil to help brighten my red spots and keep my skin hydrated since the cleanser can make it pretty dry some days. 

I then treat any break out areas with Epiduo (I use it every night but only apply it to break out prone areas and not my whole face. So cheeks, chin, and forehead).

I also use Now Solutions- European Clay Powder face mask once or twice a week (it helps brighten the skin and minimize pores and it's pretty affordable at around $6!)

I used to use benzoyl peroxide and it was pretty effective but my skin became used to it. 

I also tried tretinoin Cream and several different types of face washes, but this current routine is what really helped clear my skin!

Well they're allowing exceptions for people who's religion is a minority in those (muslim majority) countries, meaning it's only muslims that get banned. So yes, it is about religion.

The first amendment protects free exercise of religion, and the fourteenth amendment guarantees the right to due process (eg. right to an attorney), and guards against arbitrary denial of liberty, both of which are being violated. I really shouldn't have to explain that.

Native peoples were traded as slaves to Europeans but they weren't used for low end labour like African slaves mostly because they had the survival skills to survive in North American wilderness and social networks to report the absolutely terrible conditions of African slaves to their kinship groups, which were military threats to North American settlements. Also, indigenous North American slavery had a large amount of social mobility in comparison and there was an idea that Native peoples were not destined to be a vilified underclass but more of a noble but ignorant race of savages that could be civilized to a European standard (see the Canadian Residential Schools system).

What native slaves were taken were either used as domestic labour as housekeeps, used as guides by fur trade and other such bushwhacking businesses, or exported across the Atlantic to be used in environments that they had little survival skills in (I notably remember an example of Native slaves being used as ship oarsmen, a really terrible fate).

t3_5rdf01,0,1485924505,military,1,0,"Hi! As this question pertains to basic, underlying facts of the Holocaust, I hope you can appreciate that it can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we want people to get the answers they are looking for, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of response. As such, this message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as Holocaust Denial, and provide a short list of introductory reading. There is always more than can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you.

##What Was the Holocaust?

The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise!

Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?

Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps

There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was a vast complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?

Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

400% more ATV's

though we have: 

50% more fixed wing attack aircrafts 

50% more normal attack aircrafts.

We are around the same where it matters but let's not forget attacking turkey means attacking NATO, every motherfucking European nation will rape our buttholes like it's new year's in cologne.

We don't stand a chance against turkey.

Egypt is around as powerful as us so it's hard to predict.

In a defensive war against Egypt we would win as China would probably join but it probably wouldn't join in an agressive war.

&gt; Avdiivka - Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels were on Tuesday locked in fighting for a third straight day at a flashpoint town that left thousands shivering without power and sparked renewed EU concern about security in its backyard.

&gt; The clashes have claimed the lives of at least 13 civilians and fighters on both sides since Sunday - the worst outburst of violence since the two sides agreed a new truce on December 23.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko underscored the urgency of the situation by cutting short a visit to Berlin on Monday and convened an emergency meeting of his National Security and Defence Council.

&gt; &amp;quot;The intense fighting around Avdiivka in the last few days... is a blatant violation of the ceasefire, as stipulated by the Minsk agreements,&amp;quot; the EU foreign affairs arm said in a statement.

&gt; BRUSSELS - President Donald Trump has joined Russia, China and radical Islam as a threat to Europe, the president of the European Council Donald Tusk said on Tuesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;The disintegration of the European Union will not lead to the restoration of some mythical, full sovereignty of its member states, but to their real and factual dependence on the great superpowers: the United States, Russia and China,&amp;quot; Tusk wrote to the E.U. leaders.

&gt; European diplomats said senior national officials and diplomats discussed a possible E.U. response to Trump at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.

It hasn't exactly helped them reach the next level when they often spread their legs to other CONCACAF teams in important matches.

As I said before this is why it's important to qualify to things like the Confederations Cup

Btw the African teams aren't all that either. Of course they're more of a challenge than New Zealand or Honduras but that isn't saying much since they're often undisciplined, and aren't as good as they seem on paper. CAF is way better represented in European clubs than CONCACAF is, but they haven't really done any better than CONCACAF in recent WCs.

&gt;Then we won't be getting trashed when we come up against a team like Chile.

I'm pretty sure random molero #324 had nothing to do with it.

If anything, arrogance played more of a part. Beating Chile in the friendly before the tournament, plus the fact that they weren't convincing in the group stage gave us a false sense of confidence especially since we considered them as less of a threat than Argentina, who we were trying to avoid because we thought Chile was weaker remember.

&gt;We gotta change something if we wanna pass round of 16 WC.

99.9%? 

That's a rather specific and suspect number.

Let's use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Canada

We'll limit ourselves to shootings as that's what you used. Also, we'll focus on 1900 onwards. No point in including stuff from wars in the 1700s. Also omitting cases where it was a robbery that turned into murders or inter-/intra-gang violence.

* Shell Lake Murders (Sask, 1967). White male.

* Brampton Centennial Secondary School shooting (Ontario, 1975). White Male.

* National Assembly shootings (Quebec, 1984). White Male.

* École Polytechnique massacre (Quebec, 1989). Mixed (Half Algerian. Original name Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi).

* Concordia University massacre (Quebec, 1992). White Male (immigrant from Belarus).

* Mark Chahal massacre (BC, 1996). Brown Male (Sikh family. Name is Vijay (Mark) Chahal.)

* OC Transpo massacre (Ontario, 1996) White Male.

* Cruse family murders (Ontario, 2002 -- Shooter is from Wisconsin but traveled to Canada to kill ex-gf/family). White Male.

* Dawson College shooting (Quebec, 2006) Brown Male (Indian family)

* Claresholm highway massacre (Alberta, 2011) White Male.

* 2014 Moncton shootings (NB, 2014) White Male.

* 2014 Edmonton killings (Alberta, 2014). Asian Male (Vietnamese)

* 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill (Ontario, 2014). Mixed (Half Libyan)

* La Loche shootings (Sask, 2016). Unknown.

* Quebec City mosque shooting (Quebec, 2017) White Male

15 cases total. ~~10~~ 9 known to be White Males which works out to 60%. 

If you only count cases from the last 20 years you're down to 4 out of 8, or 50%. 

If you also look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Canadian you see as late as 1981 Canada was 93% European-Canadians. By 2011 it was down to 61.35%. As such, it would come as no surprise that mass shootings prior to 20 or 30 years ago were predominantly white. 

More telling is the gender disparity. Women are really underrepresented in mass killings of all sorts. (There was the Richardson family murders where a 12 year old girl and her boyfriend stabbed and strangled her family.)

We are going to see a large increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the west over the next few years.  Some will be motivated by far-right populist leaders.  Other will be from reactionaries, afraid of the terrorism that's followed immigrants into Europe, who view their governments as incompetent when it comes time to address it (heck, when Germany decided to hide the Berlin attacker's identity out of fear that it would result in hate speech on Twitter, one has to wonder about governmental priorities).

It's worth noting that terrorism in the Middle East is the result of both politics AND religion.

And I see that as a service I'm willing to pay for (though I don't but whatever, if i had to I would).  Generally, having a US passport is an enormous privilege in comparison to most other passports in the world with the exception of Singapore, and probably on par with EU passports, but compared to many other countries? Absolutely.  And that kind of mostly token (for most people) taxation is well worth that 'service' (abstract as it is.)

Also there are specific deductions and shit involving double taxation so you don't have a double burden of tax.  TO be honest I have no idea how those rules are set up specifically, because my accountant handles that (I feel like I should drop a hip-hop beat there), but I do know while I was living and working in Cambodia earning a very good wage for the US (but under the limit) + free housing I was getting paid out of an american organization's headquarters into my american bank account and I paid zero taxes **anywhere**, to any country or anyone. I think I weirdly had to pay some minor state taxes where the company was headquartered and social security but that was it.  And that minimum amount pushes up every year.  I think it's a pretty fair system.

This is just my own personal opinion but American 'service' to citizens abroad is sustained by its preeminent global position which is propped up by both its economy and its military power, as opposed to European countries where the service is direct to the citizens who are actually residing in the country except for kind of minor expenses incurred by maintaining embassies and consulates and such.

edit: as a kind of related aside I now live in the Philippines and pay taxes to the Philippine government at ~35% and I  **hate** it.  That tax is way more frustrating to me as I see how it is regularly squandered, stolen, diverted, and not used to provide adequate public services to Filipinos(I'm also a filipino citizen).

If they were considered sovereign worldwide there would be no dispute.

Should Russia have allowed Ukraine to approve it, of course, but many Russians and Crimean civilians consider the area as Russian.

Of course the west is petrified of a slow moving and a more authoritarian version of its previous democractic Russian self, and might have flashbacks to the cold war, the truth is they are barely struggling to retain an energy monopoly over the region. Oil is cheap, OPEC can't maintain a cartel when several of their countries are struggling as it is, and even if they raised prices eventually US fracking would cut out their profits.

If Obama really was concerned about a Crimea situation he sure sat on it for almost 3 whole years. Which he actually rushed ahead of schedule after he found out Trump was elected, to make sure it was done before he left.

Which ignoring our ""trade"" obligations to NATO countries, poland itself spends a very modest of less than 2% of its gdp on its defenses. The US spends 5% of which it easily outranks the next country in spending by several hundreds of billions, for a country whose only direct borders are mexico and canada. Only realistic threat is nuclear, yet decides to fund other countries defenses. It is okay to ally and assist our allies but having dozens or hundreds of bases in foreign countries when that money could be spent either here for education, infrastructure, job training or even programs that help countries with a large poverty rate to help further insure that its civilians lead productive lives would be exponentially better for everyone.

Poland itself if it were really concerned could work closer with allies closer to home and allies who have nuclear weapons such as France and the U.K. it's not as if the US needs to depend to be in the center of every event and even with Iraq and Afghanistan many european countries were fiercely against the actions taken place yet did not call for the US actually reduce its influence substantially.

Of course Poland itself is happy, but many in Germany hate the US soldiers that take base there, and many other countries feel similarly but perhaps for different reasons.

While Obama allowed more of a proxy war to take place and never officially had soldiers go in, using a spec ops approach. His record on drastically increasing drone bombing crom the Bush era and the practice of assuming all targets in its range are enemies in nature has proven to be harmful to the communities and countries where it operates. To pretend that one bombing that happened on a hospital building striking doctors without borders was a stand alone occurrence would be remarkable ignorant. Even assuming you haven't read or heard of leaked documents, the chances that the intel and means of targeting are accurate more than a coin flip is hard to believe and the program itself is entirely unethical, it is a total war approach just barely better than night bombing that occured during WW2.

But yeah we are totally letting Russia prance right into europe, with so many allies there, bases there, nukes pointed towards them, planes and submarines and boats doing counter ""practice drills"" designed to measure each others defenses. You sound as if we are on brink of war when no clear proof exists or has been made available to the public, its just a show of force.

Its not like Russians are war hungry or want to take over the world, they do have self interests just as the US does, most of the time the differences we have is just in perception, sometimes that's fed into by their propaganda or ours.

It's (IMO) wayyyy more interesting to describe how refugees could (VERY PLAUSIBLY) destabilize the political system of European nations. That is much more realistic and more atmospheric. My recommendation: somehow make Russia cause another massive middle-eastern collapse. I don't think European politics as we know it will survive another wave the size of 2015.

* The Russians can't move into New England. Their navy is at best an excuse. Also, what motive do they have to occupy the USA? They can't even afford to occupy themselves.

* Why aren't we nuking all of these people? How is the USMC and USAF standing down? In this scenario, there would be defections like in 1917 (IMO).

This, I ceased to be long ago. How long, I cannot say, for in my existence time has no meaning. It is a concept of Them, Them who I resemble superficially but share nothing with.

I am the first and the last born of Adam; the first to murder and the first to grieve. I have read the stories written of me, how I was marked by the LORD. Those who know me, have known me, have suspected nothing. Perhaps they are unfamiliar with the story. Perhaps they do not realize that not all marks are outward.

Eternity. That is my Mark. To exist, without end, without respite, until the LORD calls me home. If He ever intends to. I have spoken to Him, but He does not answer. Perhaps He intended me, once, to gain a fuller appreciation of the value of life, of His greatest creation, the progeny of my father all. I do not, cannot, know, for His ways are mysterious even to those who have spoken to Him directly.

I can only say that if this were His goal, He has failed in me.

Eternity has not strengthened in me any love for the creations of God. Rather it has inspired in me a sense of fatalism, nihilism even - for I have been witness to a thousand, thousand tragedies and as many triumphs. For each conquering hero are the lamentations of the conquered. For every precious child born is one cut down in its prime. I have borne witness to all these things. 

I was present at Golgotha when Jesus, called the Christ, was crucified; whether he was the Son of Man, I know not, but upon that day his Creator deserted him as He has deserted me.

I was there in Europe, in its darkest hours, as the Chosen People of the LORD were herded like so many cattle to slaughter in ways my mind can scarce comprehend. He was not present then either; by now, this scarce surprised me.

I have seen the horrors visited by Man upon Man, through centuries and millennia. I have seen them celebrated, honored, ignored, and very rarely, resisted. In my age, all these things blend together; war into war, genocide into genocide, supreme ruler into fleeting tyrant of one small corner of a vast and unfeeling world. I am numb to them, for experience shows that this is the way of Man. 

Perhaps this is what He wants. To wander the earth for all time, privy to all the sins of Man, the sin which I first set into motion in childish jealousy all those years ago. To feel the powerlessness my brother must have, when I set upon him. Perhaps, even, to repent of the sin. 

But I cannot, for existence - not life, no, but existence - has rendered me numb to these things. And so, I am condemned to exist, outside the grace or even the attention of God, with no hope of death to relieve me. To bear witness to all which my sin hath wrought, for all time. To do so with numbness, apathy, knowing the futility of it all.

To be of Humanity, but never again part of it. This is my Mark. ",,ahp327,t3_5rdcz8,WritingPrompts,dd6j8bb,,1488462998,False,t5_2s3nb,False

India also has women's rights issues and they're not a Muslim country, not to mention China. 

But... that doesn't invalidate what problems women face here. The pay gap is real. Now is it because women are paid less than men for the same job? Maybe not, controlled to about 2¢. But *why* do women make less on average than men? They have lower paying jobs? OK, why? Why is teaching a female dominated profession that is underpaid? Why are nurses underpaid? What can we do in those categories to increase women's salaries to make it a little more equal? Why are women getting less raises than men? Why are women seen as bitchy and aggressive while men are seen as assertive?

These are all questions modern feminism strives to answer. Mansplaining is a real phenomenon - ask any women in a position of power, *some* man has always thought he knows more than her by virtue of his penis. Hell, I had a man mansplain mansplaining to me, telling me my definition was wrong because he ""knew these things."" Those are the kind of men modern feminism strives to educate.

Third wave feminism is indeed a bigger presence in the US and Europe so it makes sense their focus would be on US and European issues, mostly today that constitutes inequality between men and women (the raise thing I mentioned earlier) and reproductive issues.

* I'd suggest first learning what is and isn't a real disadvantage/advantage of circumcision by learning how Wikipedia functions. How?
* Spend a few weeks on other wiki pages, looking in the notes and learning how it synthesizes bodies of evidence to justify what gets said. Eventually, start editing and contributing substantively to these articles, and learn how PUBMED and citing works, and about primary and especially secondary studies. 

DON'T:

* Don't be a [single purpose user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Single-purpose_account), editing Circumcision and only the Circumision article. That's lame and doesn't really show the Wiki audience you're serious about improving it for everyone. 
* I know it's disheartening, expect pushback as a default with every. single. edit. Even with a great Wiki background and some things that deservedly should be brought to the fore and published on Wiki, you will. get. pushback. Pick battles, and you'll learn the levers to get your way as you're learning how to better Wikipedia at large editing (and bettering) other medical articles. 
* Don't let emotion get the best of you! Just stick to facts - facts are our best friend. There's an increasingly large body of work spinning up in the background. 
 
**Don't expect overnight results!** Become one with Wikipedia, and without judgment learn how it works. Start for a while editing completely different articles. Fall in love with how articles get edited, what moves the needle for a facts-first editorial community, and then bring a rational, level-headed mindset to the table and make all Wiki articles - not the just circ one - a better place. That's the whole point :) 

PS - after you learn wiki, where to direct energy? well, circumcision literally amputates erogenous, sensitive tissue. I know it personally and it haunts me every day :( i know i'm missing something and it makes me pretty sad sometimes... well, use that knowledge to your strength.

There's increasingly more evidence to support sensitivity/sexual impact, so look for research articles hopefully cropping up. Also keep a keen out for things said by medical health professionals - eg Europe/Sweden's announcements - these can inform some global sentiment on the matter too, and if it's recent it's very relevant. 

Godspeed, embody Wikipedia and What it Is. Let it flow through you, after learning the ropes by calmly editing other articles. It takes months, years even, to be a great editor. And you can't learn how to do it on one article alone - try other medical articles you think you can genuinely improve.

&gt;* The 2014 annexation sparked widespread protests from Western governments and the United Nations and led to a series of crippling economic sanctions against Moscow by the West that remain in effect nearly three years later.

t3_5rce64,0,1485937526,,2,0,"&gt; is this not?

Not really that I've seen. I've seen it given lip service, sure. But in terms of *actual* policy change suggestions or even detailed critiques about what's wrong with our current screening process I have seen virtually nothing. I'd love to be proven wrong! To me it sounds like the Trump administration says our refugee policy is a disaster without providing any evidence whatsoever. 

I've linked in my edited post quite a bit of analysis about the scrutiny of our current screening processes. It would be different if we had a quantifiable problem with refugees acting out inside the US, but typically they are model residents and I know of no attacks carried out by refugees, especially refugees from the banned countries, within the last 17+ years. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; this falls in line with trumps campaign promises, is it really that surprising?

Not terribly surprising that something like it happened, though I'd still argue it is a bad policy regardless if he campaigned on it. I hoped that upon entering office he would become more knowledgeable about the complexity of the issue and move towards effective governance. Even if he really thinks such a ban is prudent the haphazard way that it was implemented in terms of not communicating it to professionals and being ambiguous about who was affected is simply not acceptable.

&gt; those people will be let back into the US no doubt. they just needed to do the whole thing suddenly and un announced- otherwise you give time to the shitty people to get their things in order.

They are still negatively affected. If I were to lock you out of your house, or tell you you can't got to work, or see your family, for a certain amount of time without providing prior notice or even a coherent and evidence-based argument as to why I think you would feel wronged.  

Again, I'm not ruling out a ban in principle, I just don't believe there is any evidence to support its efficacy. As for the argument that the bad guys will come in, well they would have to get a visa, which takes weeks. They could have put a moratorium on new visas from these countries, for example, instead of stopping existing visa holders and residents. 

The idea that ISIS has had the ability to waltz on in and were just waiting for something isn't supported by facts. If they could be here they would be and wouldn't hear of an imminent ban and say ""Oh crap, I almost forgot to use my visa to slip into the US, boy that was close."" Not saying that it absolutely couldn't happen, but it is highly unlikely IMO and doesn't justify the harm you do to thousands of good people.

&gt; personally i just want refugees to essentially stop happening, until we create a very very rigorous vetting process. i dont know if that's whats happening

Again, I reiterate that refugees in the US are an insignificant problem, or really not a problem at all. I think the refugee process in the US is strict enough, but you could make it more strict without these extreme measures. And if you don't know if it's happening shouldn't we be demanding that in tandem with a halt to travel. The Trump administration should prove it is addressing the problem it claims to be.

&gt; doing this shows these countries we aren't going to be fucking around during this administration

In what context are we talking about ""countries"". ISIS and other radial terror groups are not officially endorsed by these countries, and even those that do support terror proxy groups (Iran in terms of Hezbollah) are not actively trying to attack the American homeland. Libya, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and others would love to get the terror problems in their borders under better control. 

We are allies of the governments of many of these countries, and to my knowledge they aren't taking advantage of us in any substantive way. The policy seems to be talking big but only insulting and alienating countries that want our support and want to work with us. In terms of Yemen, there isn't even a single government to address and the people there are subject to terrible conditions. I, for one, think we should be trying to help those we safely can. 

&gt; extremely liberal refugee/immigrant policy is decimating places like germany and the UK

We are far from ""extremely liberal"" in our refugee policies here. The US faces very different geographical and demographic issues than Europe also. Finally, I don't think Merkel's policies are working out for her politically, but in the historical context of Germany I can understand why they wanted to take in refugees and help people.

Brexit and Donald Trump are two very different things. Britain's voted out because we don't like to see the poor and infirm mistreated.

Our benefits and support system is in danger of calapse because the EU says we have to pay money for families that don't even live here.
Britain's are not completely stupid and we know our resources are limited, so we can not keep taking in millions of people, we literally don't have the room. 
You never know if we stop taking in all the good hard working refugees they may stay in the country they are running from and help it become something great. 
We don't like  being remotly governed by people overseas who are only concerned about us staying in their club, a club we were significant in establishing. Many other reasons the people of Britain voted out but mainly it's because we didn't see the advantage of being able to go on skiing trips without a visa as fundamental. Granted some did and they are still pissing and moaning about their holiday spending money after exchange rates. But our real democracy says shit the majority of people have spoken and our politicians are looking and trying to figure out how to make things better.

The 'we didn't vote to leave the single market' idea that is floating around is an exercise in rewriting history in regards to what actually happened. The fact that a vote to leave would mean leaving the single market (a 'hard brexit') was probably the central point of argument between the campaigns. David Cameron and George Osborne (the two most powerful men in the country) [both confirmed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn2hSVfqtYc) in the runup to the vote. [So did head honcho behind he Leave campaign Michael Gove](https://www.ft.com/content/0c5c74bc-151e-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e). Am I the only one who hasn't developed this amnesia? There couldn't have been anyone in the country who thought that voting leave didn't mean at the very least a possible, if not probable, exit from the single market.

&gt;So why, pray tell, would it be in any way inappropriate to hold a referendum on the ACTUAL terms of Leave vs Remain. It is, in fact, the only sensible thing, as it would be having an ACTUAL referendum on two specific options. 

Because it would be pointless. For starters, you'd have to narrow things down to two options, when there are a vast number of ways of doing it, and secondly it would be irrelevant because it's not a unilateral decision on the terms of leaving, but rather a negotiation between the two parties (UK and EU). The public could vote one way and very easily be denied it by Brussels. It could be denied both.

I think you're being a bit naive. People can be raised into such ideologies from a young age and become willing to use terrorist actions because of that. Sure, in areas where such ideologies aren't the norm you can have angry/isolated/etc individuals become attracted to them, but in some societies it *is* the norm.

When we look at Saudi Arabia we see an entire nation of people who have been taught since day one a radical form of Islam known has Wahhabism. A belief that condones things like terrorism. We can't just dismiss these kinds of things as ""secondary causes"" to such behavior.

&gt;all of these root causes can be largely attributed to one main root cause: an inefficient and structurally broken social/political/economic system which causes massive inequality, poverty, excessive corporate

Norway, like all of Europe that I know of, is on 50Hz.

Speaking of which;

&gt;There is little real difference between 50 Hertz and 60 Hertz systems, as long as the equipment is designed appropriately for the frequency. It is more important to have a standard and stick with it.
&gt;
&gt;The more significant difference is that 60Hz systems usually use 110V (120V) or thereabouts for the domestic power supply, while 50Hz systems tend to use 220V, 230V etc. for different countries. This has the impact that house wiring needs to be twice the cross section for the 110V system for the same power. However the optimum system is accepted as around 230V (wire size and power required versus safety). In most of the US the 110V power system is in tandem with the 240V US system that provides for the higher powered appliances like stoves and clothes dryers, while 110V does wall outlets and lights.

&gt; Japan has rejected Donald Trump&amp;#039;s claims that Tokyo was deliberately weakening the yen to gain an unfair trade advantage over the US. Trump told a meeting of pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday that Japan, along with China and Germany, were guilty of &amp;quot;Global freeloading&amp;quot; for using regulation and currency devaluation in their trade dealings with the US. The president&amp;#039;s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, also accused Germany of using a &amp;quot;Grossly undervalued&amp;quot; euro to gain an unfair advantage over the US and other EU countries.

&gt; The US currency briefly fell to 112.08 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday, but later recovered to around 113 yen as investors sensed a bargain.

&gt; The yen has weakened considerably in that time, from about 80 yen to the dollar to a low of about 125 yen in the middle of 2015.

because the bible wasn't taken literally for thousands of years till creatonists were bored in the US and decided to believe in fairy tails, nor are most christians religious first nationalistic after, whilst most muslims are. A country I'm in went through a defensive war where people decide which is their nation based on their religion catholicism/islam/orthodox christianity, obv a monocultural place. LuL. I sound like an american when I speak english, whilst I've never interacted with any. 

 People migrating doesn't naturally mean that they income taxes when you give them someone elses money and that they're contributing, if an economy would work like that we'd just print money indefinitely and piss it all away, wouldn't need migrants to do it for us. Illegal migration doesn't increase wages and also it kills jobs because they get paid under the table get screwed by their employers, employers don't have to pay taxes for them and can write it off, the employees can't complain because they can get screwed. 

People coming from war torn areas are even a worse burden, you have to educate them try to find them work and whilst doing so they're living off the people and so on, not to mention you can help a lot more people in the place they live now than to fly some of them to the US and try to take care of them there. The GDP isn't an accurate measurement of everything thats going on because government spending is also included in some calculations and you're spending more than you have.

 The vetting process is probably enough but the problem remains that 2nd and 3rd gen migrants are radical and from middle class families whilst their parents weren't.

 Germany didn't vet them at all, they were just set on trains to germany cause nobody on the route wanted to deal with them cause they keep causing trouble wherever they stay and act like spoiled tourists but besides that. but the thing is terrorists don't have to walk through the atlantic, they can go to south america and through your land borders cause some found it to be easier, whilst smugglers run ads on arabic TVs saying european women are just waiting for them and houses and free cash etc. The deportations have been very high because they changed the definition of a deportation to include people who are turned back at the border.

 Apparently islam is now also a race, and I don't need a lesson in ""xenophobia"" , its a retarded word saying its a fear of foreigners, pick a muslim nation you'd like to live or are you too xenophobic and racist to live amongst them where they're the majority? 

 You're saying you should help as much as we can by spending more money on vetting and flying people over instead of taking care of more people there. But for some reason you think every suffering person from africa, south america , asia should have the right to come to the US/West.

&gt;WHAT CONSTITUTES A FULL-FACED VEIL??

The law is in relation to things which cover your face, in cases of ambiguity of that, courts decide the applicability.

If you want exact wording, I couldn't find the exact one for Austria, but it probably will be the same as for all the other bans in Europe. Here is the article 9a from the canton Tessin in Switzerland which has banned it:

*(1) Niemand darf sein Gesicht im öffentlichen Raum und an Orten verhüllen oder verbergen, die allgemein zugänglich sind (ausgenommen Sakralstätten) oder der Erbringung von Publikumsdienstleistungen dienen.*

*(2) Niemand darf eine Person zwingen, ihr Gesicht aufgrund ihres Geschlechts zu verhüllen.*

*(3) Das Gesetz regelt die Ausnahmen von Absatz 1 und bestimmt die Sanktionen.*

(1) basically states that ""No one may cloak or hide their face in a public place that is publicly accessible (with the exception of religious places) or during the execution of a public servant task.

(2) states that no one may force a person to cloak their face due to their gender.

(3) states that courts will decide on exceptions of (1).

So if you are a little kid running around with a ninja mask, no court will probably sanction you due to (1), so you have nothing to worry about.

t3_5r85hr,0,1485945074,,1,0,"FOM was good as long as it was only among the older members of the EU, where migration was more or less balanced in both number and type of people, and it was mostly the middle class using it for permanent migration to and from Britain. They also were generally rather scattered and didn't tend to form ethnic communities, being much more integrated with their British workmates or lovers and the circles of friends that gave them. 

Since the Poles, Romanians, etc. were let in, there have been a lot more working class people using it, but far more going to Britain than from it. On the whole the British working class didn't want any of the previous waves of immigration either (and still don't want their descendants here in a general sense even if they recognise the practical barriers to actually removing them), and they regard it as something which is a benefit only to the middle class, the rich, and foreigners.  That it is the most complete of the four freedoms and that the rest of the EU's treatment of it as a red line in maintaining even the present incomplete access to the other three freedoms only furthers the perception that it is more for their benefit than ours (after all, if it was equally beneficial they wouldn't mind us curtailing it if it was equally curtailed for us in response). 

Another more general issue with a free movement zone is that problems like excessive housing costs, labour oversupply, inadequate wages and welfare, and so on can only be effectively fixed across the whole zone at once, unless you have informal barriers that need to be more effective the bigger the relative improvement in your section of the zone is. Even if we built JC's million extra council houses, that would pull down prices, but within the free movement zone that would attract more immigrants (especially to London where demand is effectively infinite) and so it wouldn't actually relieve the shortage. 

FOM within the British isles sort of crept up on us as travel costs declined and gave us long enough to get used to it, and the differences are small enough that apart from religion (especially Catholicism) for those who still take it seriously migrants pretty much assimilate within a generation.

I am someone who thinks illegal as well a legal immigration, and in particular islamic immigration, is a major challenge for the west (especially for Europe) and should therefore be limited in scale. The point is to preserve the culture and values that allow for liberal secular democracy.

Yet I don't forget that, no matter what one thinks about Islam, Muslims are human beings and deserve respect. When you give your word to someone, you stay true to it - that's a basic principle of human decency, and it doesn't suddenly disappear when interacting with someone who is not a US citizen. You can't promise somebody a new life, watch them quit their job, sell their house, come to their new country... and then stop them at the door and tell them to fuck off.

1) Some people didn't want to go in in 1973 and legit would feel this was their chance to say the same again. One person said this to me in casual conversation.

2) Some people felt that the EEC they voted to join, or were familiar with, was an ECONOMIC community. Indeed, WE were instrumental in the idea of coming up with the Single Market. So people felt: 'Yeah- we signed on for the EEC, we did not get asked whether we wanted the EU.' 

3) Nostalgia. Britain has steadily lost world power since 1945. Maybe since 1914! Although, for me, as you know from my earlier post, this is about globalisation, many people think that leaving the EU would at the least arrest the decline, and the dilution of what they know. Typically, older people dislike change (and therefore people tend to move right as they get older) because the loss of what they know is more scary and irritating than the gain of new things that did not exist before, for which a period of adaptation is needed.

4) Distrust of or opposition to multiculturalism. Britain has changed a lot in the last generation, especially since 1997. This is worrying for a lot of older people and they see the EU as a big element of this.

5) Older people may simply have less to gain from being in the EU- they don't want to work and study abroad, and they may be financially better insulated against the period of slower growth that is likely from the adjustment.",,tmstms,t1_dd6kf11,unitedkingdom,dd6oggq,West Yorkshire,1488465863,False,t5_2qhqb,False

Notice how the migrants want to go to the countries with the best social welfare benefits for migrants instead of just staying in the first European country they land in? It's not like they're in great danger of being killed in Italy or Croatia. Italy and Croatia aren't war zones like Syria, but they don't have welfare like the UK does.

They'd still go to europe because humanity has a collective mentallity. Try removing statehood, and people will just go defacto. Europeans societal values are also superior to the ones in Islamic countries, and would still be better.

&gt;Sweden is super progressive, and Somalis seem to hate them more. It's very bizarre to me. Like the hate BLM protesters have for white Sanders supporters.

Now I know most of your views are what you see on youtube. I'm one, I have family there, and trust me they want any other place than the shithole somalia is. Distrustful, and disliking of western culture, yes, but no they don't hate swedes at all. BLM is cancer, but bringing racial problems into the public isn't bad. Sweden is having a rise of fascists, the democrats, people like you that just want to discriminate. We can't as civilized people go down that road.

&gt;The Japanese don't worry about making the non-Japanese more progressive. They just keep them out of their country in their first place, and Japan has low crime rates.

Japan has 70,000 Muslims in their country(not a small number), and the ones that got in are decent. The problem with europe is who they let in, and we're very far down the hole now. Anti muslim sentiment would increase the rapes, the problems and violence. Now you're probably thinking, just deport them! They have no papers, and many more are there legally. Good luck shipping every Muslim immigrant in Europe back to their homes. It's a virtually impossible task.

I'll tell you now truthfully, current Muslims are a product of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 60s most Muslim countries we now hate were progressive as fuck, Abdul Nassir of Egypt laughed amoungst the crows at the mere thought of bringing back the veil, and likened it to medieval retardation. The shah of Iran would often mail the king of Saudi to let his people be free and liberal, and to introduce discos as they were the only way forward. In the 60s Islamic world, things like viels were virtually non existant. Muslims, like us, can become progressive again. Hatred and discrimination isn't the way, and deepens anti western sentiments. The only way Muslims can change is if we continue to set the right example. People aren't stupid, Islamism has waned in the past, and it will wane again.

Ever since Goldwater lost to Johnson, the Republican party has been run by neoconservatives; they want a globalist foreign policy under American hegemony and they reject limited government and privacy. 

Likewise, the Democrats have been taken over by neoliberals, globalist foreign policy, and the rejection of limited government and individualism. 

There is a startling amount of overlap between the two ideologies. Both favor multinational trading blocs like NAFTA, and bow to multinational corporations and banking cartels. Both believe in a strong globalist American presence (although the execution may differ, one wants allies under an American banner like chicks under a mother hen, the other prefers where a body such as the UN takes precedent), and both oppose nationalist movements wherever they might threaten the status quo or oppose American or European interests in any way.

That is why McCain, Graham, Romney, and Ryan preferred Hillary to Trump, and why they were willing to sacrifice the supreme court, the White House, perhaps even the future of the GOP just to maintain the status quo. (Of course, being politicians, they are still pragmatists, and it was amusing to watch them rush to kiss Trump's ass to hopefully save their own.)

Speaking of status quo, I sincerely believe Trump is the biggest threat to the status quo since the founding of this nation. Both parties have worked on a certain level of elitism and both act in the interests of the same puppeteers. Notice how bailouts are usually bipartisan? ""Consensus"" works the same way; one side wants pork, but so does the other, so they compromise, hand out money for both, and screw the American taxpayer. As both can freely dump the blame for the little stuff on Trump (a closed miltary base for example) and bow to his grand fixes (such as term limits and infrastructure reforms) to weather the wave of popular opinion, Trump, as an outsider not financially or politically bound to the status quo, is the first president in history to be in a real position to break this cycle, and I cannot wait!",,Malcolm_of_Fire,t3_5rdv7i,AskThe_Donald,dd6poop,CENTIPEDE!,1488466527,False,t5_3fuwj,1485951521
t3_5raop8,0,1485951192,,8,0,"It's no coincidence.  Copy pasted below is Gordon Murray writing about the NSX:


A Car Dear to my Heart - Gordon Murray on the Honda NSX

To this day, the NSX is still a car that is near and dear to my heart. I put 75,000 Km on my NSX over the course of six or seven years.

It's very difficult to discuss the NSX using current values and sensibilities. When the NSX debuted, the word ""supercar"" was still a relatively new idea in Europe. There are some who would say the Lamborghini Miura from the late 1960s was the first supercar. However, the truth is the explosion of modern supercars really started at the end of the 1980s.

At the end of the 80s was the time when McLaren Cars was conceiving the idea for the McLaren F1. To that end, I was concentrating on coming up with what I wanted in a road car.

To my thinking, the ideal car is one in which I could get in the driver's seat and be out for a drive in downtown London and then want to continue straight on to the South of France. A car that you can trust, with functional air conditioning and retains daily drivability. No offset pedals allowed. No high dashboards restricting your view either. Having a low roof hitting your head every time you go over a bump in the name of aerodynamics and styling is out of the question. It is essential that a supercar be a pleasure to drive, and anything detracting from that must be excised.

I started by driving the cars known then as ""supercars."" The Porsche 959, Bugatti EB110, Ferrari F40, Jaguar XJ220. Unfortunately, none of these fit the pattern of the supercar we were trying to build. What we wanted was a relatively compact, usable driver's car. The Porsche 911 had the usability, but with the engine packed in the back, it had a weakness in its handling stability.

During this time, we were able to visit with Ayrton Senna (the late F1 Champion) Honda's Tochigi Research Center. The visit related to the fact that at the time, McLaren's F1 Grand Prix cars were using Honda engines.

Coincidentally, I spotted an NSX prototype parked near the course. I also learned at the time that Ayrton was assisting in the development of the NSX and that Honda rear mid-engined sports car–the NSX–was the friendly supercar that we had been looking for. This car had perfectly functional air conditioning, a reasonably roomy trunk and of course, it was a Honda, with the high levels of quality and reliability that implies.

Then I had the opportunity to drive it. Along with Ron Dennis (President, McLaren Cars) and Mansour Ojjeh (Tag McLaren Group Representative), we drove the prototype on the Tochigi Research Center test course. I remember being moved, thinking, ""It is remarkable how our vision comes through in this car.""

Of course as you know, the engine has only six cylinders; however, the NSX's very rigid chassis is excellent and would easily be capable of handling more power. Although it's true I had thought it would have been better to put a larger engine, the moment I drove the ""little"" NSX, all the benchmark cars–Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini–I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind. Of course the car we would create, the McLaren F1, needed to be faster than the NSX, but the NSX's ride quality and handling would become our new design target.

When working on the development of a new car for years, it's easy to be caught in certain pitfalls. When you drive the car under development for testing every day (in truth, I was responsible for two-thirds of the testing for the McLaren F1), in that time, you can unknowingly convince yourself you are making progress when in fact you are not. For example, it's human nature that at the end of a long day you may want to think that your efforts to reduce low speed harshness are working better than they are. It is at times like this when you need a car to compare with. In those situations, the NSX time and again showed us the path in the areas of ride quality and handling, and also helped us recognize when we weren't making as much progress as we thought.

In my opinion, the NSX's most special quality has long been overlooked.

That could be summarized with the words, ""The NSX's suspension is amazing.""

Both the body and suspension are aluminum, and it probably couldn't be helped that journalists' attention has been focused on praising the aluminum body. However, the suspension is the much more impressive use of aluminum.

It's lightweight, tough, yet compliant. Also contributing to the refined NSX's handling and ride quality are 17 inch wheels and tires that are not overly large. The NSX's suspension is truly an ingenious system, and back then I imagined the development costs must have been enormous. To achieve that unparalleled accuracy and superior ride quality, longitudinal wheel movement is allowed via the use of a compliance pivot.

Compliance refers to when you travel over a bump, the tire experiences a longitudinal force, which the tire and suspension must move with and absorb the shock. The pivot couples the upper and lower arms. It is connected to the arms via ball joints so that they move as a unit. When encountering input, the pivot rotates, keeping alignment changes to near zero while retaining compliance (see diagram). The inspiration obtained from this NSX suspension system would later influence the development of the McLaren F1′s suspension.

The NSX was also the first car to use DBW (Drive By Wire). It felt very pleasing. DBW is when instead of using a mechanical cable, an electronic signal is used to communicate throttle position. It achieved a very natural, linear feeling throttle, and I can now hide my embarrassment and confess that I copied the idea during the development of the McLaren F1 (laughs).

The low-slung NSX's driver's seat position also provided just the right head clearance and an amazing field of view. The NSX development team moved the air conditioning unit away from the dash and deep into the NSX's nose in order to obtain more space. That air conditioning unit is an excellent one, and normally, you don't notice whether it's on or not.

On the day I bought the NSX, I pressed the ""Auto"" button and since then until selling it, I never had to touch it. It was that perfect. Ah, I also remember the audio system as being very good.

However, the media wrote up the aluminum body and the many merits and advantages I perceived in the NSX have largely been overlooked.

In my opinion, the NSX, while being such a great sports car, had two large flaws in its marketing. First, at the time, the public was not ready to accept a Japanese car that was this expensive. The second is that for supercar customers, the power figures were not quite high enough. Of course, the prototype's engine was not bad, and soon the VTEC engine was added. Whenever I hear that VTEC sound it's amazing. I am repeating myself, but the NSX's excellent chassis would have been capable of handling much more power.

With just a slightly lower price, or possibly selling it with a different brand name and a different badge, or perhaps endowing it with a touch flashier and more aggressive styling and additional power, there is no question the NSX would have reigned as a cult star of the supercars.

However, during that time, in Honda's philosophy there was a resistance to large engines with many cylinders. I am not certain, but probably at the time, the voluntary restraint on power limits was a factor. Being a fan of Honda engines, I later went to Honda's Tochigi Research Center on two occasions and requested that they consider building for the McLaren F1 a 4.5 liter V10 or V12. I asked, I tried to persuade them, but in the end could not convince them to do it, and the McLaren F1 ended up equipped with a BMW engine.

The NSX's development costs must have been enormous. Everything on it is unique. The chassis, powertrain, even the air conditioning are peerless. That aluminum body was very expensive. The numerous hurdles overcome by the NSX to reach production in areas such as spot welding, corrosion, and repairability make it a monumental work in automotive history. The philosophy of creating a car for human beings is apparent throughout. If it were me, I probably would not have obsessed over the aluminum and would have settled for a steel structure with aluminum panels to try to achieve a similar weight reduction. But what I really want to emphasize is the suspension. It is a a groundbreaking use of aluminum.

There are a few things that could be improved on the NSX. First, the tires are too soft. Over the seven years I ran mine, I went through 14 sets of tires. After changing over to harder-compound Michelins in the rear, my tire life increased. As a result, rear grip was decreased slightly, but driving became more fun. The NSX's traction control and ABS are first generation systems and as a result are somewhat slow-acting. I also missed having more storage space in the interior. However, such things hardly seem significant in a sports car of this calibre.

The NSX is a landmark car. It awoke not only a lazy Ferrari, but Porsche as well and sparked advances in usability, ergonomics, and handling. It may not have achieved success from a marketing standpoint, but many influential and important people have owned them. The NSX is also unusual in that it continued to be on sale for so long. If I were to looking for that type of car now, I would–without a doubt–gladly own an NSX again.

This is definitely a problem.  I wouldn't even necessarily say that you have to change your mind, but just be open to other ideas and taking them on board, rather than flat our dismissing them.  Sure if evidence shows climate change is real I wouldn't say someone should stick to their conviction that it isn't, but when it comes to other issues that are largely philosophical or ideological (Capitalism vs Socialism for example) then sticking to principles *whilst absorbing new information and analysis* is a must.

Like with the EU.  It seems so many are ideologically opposed to it, which is fine, but refuse to learn anything about how it operates, how regional groupings work the world over, how intergovernmental organisation exist and function, the pros and cons of the supranational elements of the Government or how it affects the UK and geopolitics past the claims that those evil politicians in Brussels are trying to control their lives.

Because it is a US ally maybe? Maybe that's why? If I have a friend that I've been arming for years you better fucking believe that when my friend is attacked I'd go in and help them. Are you really asking that?

&gt;the country which fired missiles on Israel during the First Gulf War, and the latter had to refrain from defending itself because Bush Sr. warned that by doing so it would break the coalition? (hint: Muslim countries don't like Jews, see title thread)

You mean the way it broke the coalition against ISIS when Israel attacks pro-Assad forces? Israel is more than happy to get involved - and nothing happens as a result - when it suits them.

&gt;With regards to financial support, the 38 billion dollars, spanning over the course of 10 years, is actually translated into buying highly priced weapons and equipment exclusively from the American military industry.

So what? It's still giving people free money.

If you want to give the money to the American people you could just give it to the American people. Don't act as if it isn't a gift to Israel.

&gt;The financial support to Israel actually breathes life back into U.S. industry, and invites the creation of jobs for Americans.

Are you joking? So you're telling me that if I give $1000 to some guy and he in turns uses it to buy goods off me - that I'm somehow ahead?

Enough with the BS please.

&gt; Not least, Israel as an important ally helps the U.S. with intelligence, technology and other top areas. It's a fruitful positive symbiotic relationship between two democracies. FYI Trump noted and appreciated the fact that unlike other allies (such as South Korea and Japan), Israel doesn't ask for American troops, it defend itself solely with Israeli soldiers (hence name of IDF: Israel Defense Forces). The next article explains the financial aid very well:

What? The US is leaps and bounds ahead of Israel with their technology. If you look at the money, the education, the resources in general, they are all in favor of the US. How would Israel be helping? You mean by selling military secrets to China?

&gt;Please do not be washed over with the ever so going trend of blind hate for Israel, which actually flourishes within the liberal ranks, the opposite of what you actually claim.

No it doesn't. Hillary Clinton was Israel's #1 supporter. Don't pretend otherwise please.

&gt;Political matters have never been one sided. FYI Israel got hurt by American interests many times. One of the best examples is the 1973 War, see article dealing with recent declassified CIA documents: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4910407,00.html . The U.S. has warned Israel, no less, not to initiate preemptive strike against Syria and Egypt, despite both planning a brutal war. As a result of getting caught up in the U.S.-Soviet game, Israel was on the verge of annihilation. It lost 3000 soldiers. It was a miracle that it survived that war.

It wasn't a fucking miracle. Are you serious?

&gt;During the night of October 8–9, an alarmed Dayan told Meir that ""this is the end of the third temple.""[294] He was warning of Israel's impending total defeat, but ""Temple"" was also the code word for nuclear weapons.[295] Dayan again raised the nuclear topic in a cabinet meeting, warning that the country was approaching a point of ""last resort"".[297] That night Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-of-TNT (84 TJ) tactical atomic weapons for Jericho missiles at Sdot Micha Airbase, and F-4 aircraft at Tel Nof Airbase, for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets.[295] They would be used if absolutely necessary to prevent total defeat, but the preparation was done in an easily detectable way, likely as a signal to the United States.[297] Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert on the morning of October 9. That day, President Nixon ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, an American airlift to replace all of Israel's material losses.[298] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger told Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear"".[295] However, subsequent interviews with Kissinger, Schlesinger, and William Quandt suggested that the nuclear aspect was not a major factor in the decision to re-supply. These officials cited the ongoing Soviet re-supply effort and Sadat's early rejection of a ceasefire as the primary motivators.[299] European countries refused to allow U.S. airplanes carrying supplies for Israel to refuel at their bases, fearing an Arab oil embargo, with the exception of Portugal and the Netherlands. Portugal permitted the United States to use a leased base in the Azores,[300] and the defence minister of the Netherlands, apparently acting without consulting his cabinet colleagues, secretly authorised the use of Dutch airfields.[301]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War#U.S._aid_to_Israel

It was US assistance that kept Israel afloat. More aid from Americans. Not a miracle by any means of the word.

&gt;American-Israel friendship is important to both sides and as with any other relationship, it has known highs and lows. It is my hope that right now it will only get better.

The American-Israel 'friendship' only hurts the US. It does nothing for American technology, it does nothing for the American people but take money out of their pockets. It is a tragedy that Americans still support such a backwards fucked up place that does so much wrong and spreads so much hate throughout the world and I'm hoping that Trump will be the first to start calling them out on their bullshit.",,moeloubani,t1_dd6qckn,The_Donald,dd6r3qj,,1488467300,False,t5_38unr,False

In general, though, countries are happy to operate a single currency across their territory, and they use the taxes from rich areas to subsidise poor areas as a compensation for the inability of poorer areas to compete via devaluation. So London happily subsidises Liverpool and Maryland subsidises Mississippi; there is no controversy here, no particular resentment about it, it's all one country after all.

I'd say there is ample resentment, for example about the Barnett formula or, in the USA, the liberal welfare queens on the coasts mooching off the US heartland (while in reality the conservative rural states are being subsidized by the coasts, but passons) and there exists similar resentment in the examples I named. So to be consistent they should split up their countries then, if that is something that is crucial for unity.

The i3 received a low insurance rating in [both North America and Europe](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089067_2014-bmw-i3-cheaper-to-repair-insure-than-youd-expect) despite its extensive use of carbon fiber.  Basically, everything is segmented so you just cut and glue new pieces in if something breaks.  The actual material is more expensive, but the labor costs are significantly lower, which brings repair costs down to what you'd expect for similar cars.",,jetshockeyfan,t1_dd6d2h8,teslamotors,dd6sc21,,1488467974,False,t5_2s3j5,False

Not many people outside the US was really aware of how bad it was. Sure, the world had heard of people like Billy Graham and the more public displays of American religion but it took the Internet for people outside the US to really get to see how insanely brainwashed the US as a whole is.  
  
This insularity from the world in general, developed a lot of local, dipshit crazy denominations that are just mouth droppingly stupid, such as snake handling morons who think poisonous snakes can't hurt them because god.  
  
It is also connected to the fact that the US is very right wing and without a decent political and electoral system which resulted in no Social Democratic movement and no real labor unions. What is seen internationally as center-left and left, is much less religious than what is called left in the US, the moderately conservative Democrats are just as religious a the Republicans.  
  
The US lost out on a lot of what was taking place in western Europe during the 20th century and as such, religion has survived while it fell drastically in countries that started focusing on improving the conditions for its citizens. The US completely ignored doing this and the result can be seen today, horrible working conditions, no universal healthcare, no real vacations, an educational system more concerned with indoctrination than education.  
  
Alas, there are many reasons why the US is so religious, mostly because they have such bad social end economic conditions for the vast majority of citizens. The church and religion became a crutch for those who had it bad.

So I'm Australian and the last referendum we had was to remove the Queen as our head of state and to replace the Governor General (the Queen's representative) with a President.

There are three major differences in how referendums are held in Australia. First you have to get a super majority to pass a change, voting is compulsory so 100% of the population voted in it and finally the referendum has to be for an explicit change to the constitution. So before the vote was even held the proposal had to explain exactly what the new system was, how the President would be appointed and what their role was. 

The majority of the population actually wanted to become a republic, but the vote was still lost because not everyone agreed with how the President would be appointed.

If it had been held the same way as it was here, then we would have voted to become a republic and then had years of arguments over the form and then resulted in a system the population is unhappy with. Pretty much what is happening here.

Whether you agree with the super-majority rule or not, this referendum really should have been for an explicit change. It should have been clear from the start that the vote would be to leave the EU, but remain in the EEA, or to leave both the EU and the EEA, or whatever other system is currently being argued.

Yes all all 3 millions were involved in guns and drugs. The reason those things spread was because government didn't take any measures to manage them.

I'd rather read something else than an editorial?

Have you read the interview linked? It's pretty interesting. The editorial you linked seems to me to be a bit disingenuous. Here are some quotes that I think do state the situation clearly, but aren't in the editorial : ""GEORGE FRIEDMAN: Here you have two countries: one wants a Ukraine that is neutral. The other wants Ukraine to form part of a line of containment against Russian expansion. One cannot say that one party is mistaken: both are acting based on their national interests. It's just that these interests don't jive.

For the Americans, as I have said, it's important to prevent the emergence of a hegemon in Europe. But recently the U.S. has begun to worry about Russia's potential and its intentions. Russia is beginning to move from the defensive position that it has held since 1992 in the direction of the restoration of its influence. It's a matter of the fundamental divergence of the national interests of two great powers.""

and

""GEORGE FRIEDMAN: It is always easier to explain a difficulty by reference to someone else's deliberate actions. But a number of countries, including China, India and Brazil, have reduced their forecasts as regards their rate of economic growth. And Europe by the way has a zero growth. What is more, a revolution in the petroleum sector is taking place, the amount of available oil is growing.

A fall in oil prices wasinevitable. What else did you expect? But you have built your economic strategy not only on high oil prices, but on the export of energy resources as such. That made you vulnerable! You should have used the last 10-15 years of high earnings from selling energy resources to diversify the economy, but your government did not do this.""

and 

""GEORGE FRIEDMAN: Russia will not make concessions in the Crimea, that is obvious. But I imagine it will face serious problems with getting supplies to the peninsula. And yet Moscow cannot retreat from a number of its requirements with respect to Ukraine. It cannot allow Western military forces to be located on Ukraine territory. This is a nightmare in Moscow, and limits its room for maneuver.

The US will need to make a strategic decision, not now but in the future, either to intervene more actively in events in Ukraine, which is fraught with difficulties, or to build a new alliance -- within NATO or outside of NATO -- with the participation of Poland, Romania, the Baltic States and, for example, Turkey. This is already happening, slowly but it is happening. And this will be something that Russia will not accept -- a ""cordon sanitaire."" It's not that the US needs to have control over Ukraine; for them the important thing is that it not be controlled by Russia.

Much will depend on Kive.The government in Kiev is the Ukraine's weak point. If it fractures - something which, surprisingly, is not what we observe, then Russia will try to turn this to their favor.

But the main question is whether Russia itself can come through in one piece. It is now facing many of the factors that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union: the lack of an effective transportation system; a skeptical attitude towards the capital in many regions, from the Caucasus to the Far East; but the main thing is that there is an economy that can only function under certain circumstances -- namely, high energy prices. You have only one product, and today there is an excess of it on the global market.""

As for the coup, Friedman does say it in the interview, though I wonder if he does say it elsewhere than in this interview, or if he's even accurately quoted. Searching on google, the reference to a coup is explicitly russian ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution) [2](http://liveuamap.com/en/2017/30-january-interfax-russian-court-decision-on-recognition)). So could he be using russia's language since the interview is with a russian magazine?

Also, I'm not sure how accurate it is to call it a coup d'état. You can look at the [definition here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) : A coup d'état (/ˌkuː deɪˈtɑː/ About this sound listen (help·info); French: [ku deta]), sometimes translated as ""blow of state"" or ""hit of state"", but the literal translation is ""stroke of the state"" – as in the swiping or stroke of a sword; plural: coups d'état, (pronounced like the singular form), also known simply as a coup (/kuː/), putsch, or an overthrow, is the illegal and overt seizure of a state by the military or other elites within the state apparatus.[1]

t3_5renpe,1,1485958686,,-2,0,"&gt; People I know of my own age have lived in the EU for the whole of their adult lives. 

Very few.  Latest figures show that actually, once you remove children and retirees the number of UK adults living and working in the EU is about 0.5% of UK working population.  And how many of those live and work in the EU for the ""whole of their adult lives""?  Very, very, few.

&gt; Many of us have friends and family from other EU countries. Many of us have lived and worked in other EU countries. All of us, absolutely all of us have worked with colleagues from other EU countries.

Why would any of this change?  I have plenty of friends from non-EU countries too.  I have lived and worked in non-EU countries.  This is a non-issue.

&gt; I'm passionate about the EU, not because of financial stability, but because of the terrible slight that it represents to my friends, family, colleagues and neighbours who happen to have been born elsewhere in the EU. 

No-one is saying nor has ever said that being born overseas is bad.  What was said is that mass immigration is bad.  Stop making it personal and imagining insults.  

&gt; One moment they were full members of society, the next they have been disenfranchised, officially told that they are not wanted, and threatened with expulsion from their homes.

Bullshit.  Absolute bullshit.  As a nation we voted leave the EU, a big part of which was in order to control our own borders.  No one suggested nor has ever suggested that we start removing folks who were here before the vote.  No-one has ever been threatened with expulsion, from their homes, jobs. the nation or otherwise.  Get a damn grip man.

&gt; That's appalling. Terrifying. I feel no fellowship whatsoever with people who support it. None.

No it isn't appalling.  What is appalling is a country not having control over it's own migration policy.  A country who's schools, hospitals, housing and infrastructure is being put under so much pressure due to unlimited immigration that it is putting British citizens and future generations at a disadvantage. 

Your whole thread seems to boil down to some imagined offense; that you have read ""limit immigration"" as ""50%+"" of the population hates anyone from the EU.  That is moronic and completely wrong.  For a self-declared well educated smart person that's a bloody stupid thing to think.

t3_5rd2d9,0,1485959150,religion,2,0,"This is the subject of a great deal of debate.  A big part of the issue is that we can't simply ask old Germans if they knew what was going on to Jews.  Well, that's not quite true--we can ask them, but we can't be sure they're telling the truth.  While we tend to think of Germans as a group as feeling guilty about WW2, this does not necessarily mean each individual German who survived that era feels that way about their own actions.

It is important to note that the mass killing of Jews happened almost entirely in Eastern Europe, not in Germany proper.  But, there would've been strong indications something was amiss.  Jews were being rounded up en masse and sent for ""resettlement in the East"", a common euphemism.  If you put two and two together, the fact that many thousands of Jews were rounded up and shipped ""to the East"" and never heard from again, you could reasonably deduce that *something* bad was happening to them.  But you might not have jumped straight to mass murder, and humans are really good at not putting two and two together if the result of that is distressing to them.  And the Jewish population in Germany was relatively small, especially after a large share fled during the 1930s.  So to most people, they wouldn't've seen the full extent of the roundups in the first place.

But, people do talk to each other.  There were rumors about what was going on in the East--people who had, say, entire families and Poland or Ukraine and then one day stopped hearing from them and was unable to contact them or anyone who knew them was aware that something was wrong, and they told people.  Word about mass murder spread, but at that point it was just rumor, and as above people will often choose to not believe something so distressing if possible (which is part of why the allies often forced Germans to bury bodies in camps near them, forcing them to come face-to-face with the atrocities).

And the extent of the massive genocide machine that Germany produced meant that there were a *ton* of Germans who would've been at least peripherally aware of what was going on.  First of all, there were some camps in Germany.  Not Death Camps, where the sole enterprise of the camp was mass murder, but camps were brutality and murder were the norm.  Certainly neighbors of Mathausen, Buchenwald, or Bergen-Belsen would've known people were being killed in large numbers there, or they should've known and intentionally remained ignorant.  I mean, over the years one of the guards will come into town and let something slip, someone will take a wrong turn and see barbed wire with starving people behind it, etc, to say nothing of people who actually lived near these places.

But, part of the massive genocide machine meant that a huge number of people were involved in other ways, not just being a guard in or living near a camp.  Anyone who worked for the railway would have seen trains full of Jews crammed into cattle cars and not returning.  While a German knowing their neighbors were ""deported"" might reasonably be ignorant of the scale and brutality of what was going on, seeing thousands upon thousands of people shipped east couldn't be.  And for, say, the train engineer actually arriving at a camp, he would've seen thousands and thousands of people constantly arriving at a camp that clearly lacked the size or facilities for even one trainload of people, let alone daily trains of people arriving.  Germans were involved in processing and distributing Jewish possessions (jewelry, hair, shoes, clothes, etc), which also should've raised eyebrows.  Engineers had to design vans for gassing people, and from records of the R&amp;D process it is clear they would've known that these were used in practice, not just in theory, to kill groups of unsuspecting people.

And that's before we even touch the subject of regular soldiers on the Eastern Front.  The Wehrmacht committed a litany of war crimes in Eastern Europe, which included indiscriminate murder of civilians.  While not every soldier actually committed these war crimes, most would've been aware of them.  And they would've been in close proximity to active genocide, seeing huge populations crammed into ghettos that clearly couldn't fit the population, people ""deported"" from those ghettos, etc.

Many of those who were aware and not deliberately ignorant would've talked about this to their friends and neighbors, even if they didn't mention specifics.  It is therefore very likely that a significant segment of the German population was aware that *something* horrible was happening, even if they didn't know details.  It is impossible to accurately guess what share of the German population that was.",,gingerkid1234,t3_5rd2d9,AskHistorians,dd6twpk,Jewish Studies,1488468849,False,t5_2ssp3,False

Consequently, the Russian people didn't just want a return to pre-war borders, they wanted payback, and to massively expand their borders.

&gt;Is the chart correct?

In terms of temperature the chart is simplistic but plausible as a very rough representation. It's actually a subjectively drawn schematic apparently derived largely from written descriptions of warm and cool phases in a book from the early 1990s. More recent objective estimates derived from d18O isotopes look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png) and [this](https://bbickmore.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/phanerozoic_temp2.png).

The CO2 curve comes from the GEOCARB III model. This predicts CO2 estimates using geological information and physical modeling of processes like weathering which affect CO2 levels - it's not actual measurement of CO2. Furthermore, the model time resolution is on the order of tens of millions of years, so many fluctuations will be smoothed over even assuming the model is accurate. [This chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Phanerozoic_Carbon_Dioxide.png) shows a few other CO2 estimates and also shows the large uncertainty in the GEOCARB III output.

The short story is that the data isn't good enough for making these simple fluctuation correlation assessments. Too uncertain in a number of aspects.

In terms of long-term trends the CO2 charts suggest a fairly robust steady decline from 500mya (about 4000-6000ppm) to present (200-300ppm) without such a feature in the temperature record. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the increase in solar luminosity of around 4-5% across that period. This is calculated to produce an opposite climate forcing of similar magnitude which counterbalances the CO2 decline.

&gt;2) https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Abbildung_6-25.jpg Shows that the temperature rises first and then the CO2 concentration

The graph shows a temperature reconstruction based on an Antarctic ice core, and a CO2 reconstruction presumably also from an Antarctic ice core. Shakun et al. 2012 showed that the [global average temperature (i.e. an average of data collected from various sites around the world) change actually appears to have lagged the CO2 change](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/ShakunFig2a.jpg) despite agreeing that Antarctic temperature increase likely preceded CO2. Though they did note that the Antarctic lag isn't significant (i.e. the uncertainty relating to ice core dating error and potential error in determining the start of an upward trend means that CO2 mostly leading Antarctic temperature cannot be ruled out).

Of course, the CO2 rise during that deglaciation phase is not due to human activity. It therefore needed to be triggered by some change or changes within the Earth system. It therefore makes sense that some parts of the world might warm prior to CO2 increase. One plausible ""first cause"" is a change in the Southern Ocean, possibly in response to some combination of orbital (Milankovitch) dynamics, which initiate some surface warming (also warming the adjacent Antarctic continent) and eventually leading to a gradual rise in CO2. That would explain a lag from Antarctic warming and the preceding of global warming.

&gt;3) He criticizes that there are only 8 measurement stations to measure the temperature on the Antarctic. And he thinks, that someone is not able to measure an global average temperature.

I think the first thing to do is point out the inconsistency in this argument in relation to the other two. He criticizes only 8 stations recording actual direct temperature measurements on Antarctica yet is happy to draw grand conclusions from a single ice core proxy record. He says that we're not able to measure a global average temperature with the huge abundance of land and ocean surface readings we have today from all over the world, and yet made a positive argument for lack of correlation between CO2 and global average temperature over the past 500million years, over which time data availability for estimating a global average is far worse.

But the *real* issue is that these ridiculous comparisons distract from the serious challenges that the EU is facing.  The EU has been sheltered by the US for two full generations, and now the idea that that might be coming to an end creates a lot of anxiety.  

...and the fear is well founded.  The EU just lost a very important member, it's huge trade deal (TPP) has just died, *internal* Islamic terrorism strikes regularly, one of its neighbors and potential members is under invasion, its land route to the energy producing countries is cut off, it has insufficient energy production of its own, and it is subjected to migrant crisis after migrant crisis with no end in sight and a *bursting* African population to the south.  

Most troubling is that with these terrifying challenges, there is no central leadership.  No one to ring the alarm bells.  All we hear are politicians doubling-down on their existing strategies.

For instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law.

The problem is that throughout most of my country's history (Romania) we were more often than not closer to danger. We've almost always been stuck between hostile powers - between the migratory tribes and the Roman empire, between the Habsburgs/Austro-Hungarian Empire / Tzarist Empire / Ottoman Empire, in WWII Nazis to the West, Stalin the the East (of course, that's true for a lot of other countries) and so on.

t3_5rdr2g,0,1485960783,,21,0,"You'll probably get a handful of different answers but there's a few common ideas that seem to crop up on this topic. For the record, I'm American so this is based on readings and discussion but not necessarily firsthand experience with the cultures and economics.

1: Joining the Eurozone/adopting the Euro

This is one of the more contentious answers, as people seem to be very split on whether or not adopting the Euro is a good or bad thing. Yet the problem with a single currency across an area as diverse as Europe is that each country in the EU is wildly different.

When a large country has most of the control over EU policy, they tend to use it; the austerity measures introduced in Greece are merely one example of it. Was it the best call? [Probably not](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/does-austerity-work-or-does-it-make-things-worse/) but Germany and the other, larger EU countries and organizations had to balance what their people wanted and what the banks wanted with trying to keep Greece from collapsing.

Spain's problem was instead a massive housing boom mixed with lower interest rates; effectively Spain was [doing okay while Germany wasn't](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/04/16/spains-shining-economic-recovery-or-how-the-eurozone-defines-success-down/#178632ff11c9). Since interest rates were set to German levels, it didn't keep up with Spain and helped prop up a massive economic speculation bubble. Housing market drops, bubble pops and now Spain is still struggling to get itself back to stability in some ways.

2: Immigration Tensions

Without touching upon the morality and hether it's politically correct or not, taking in thousands upon thousands of foreign economic migrants from wildly different cultures is not a stepping stone towards stability. While many did not stick around in Southern Europe, they still required resources and government intervention on *some* scale, drawing those resources away from other measures the government could use to work on its' own economy.

Many of these economic migrants from North Africa tended to go through Italy and Greece; both countries hit hard and still struggling after the recession and austerity, now have to deal with this new problem. Add to that Germany and the EU holding their feet to the fire on handling the influx certainly added stress to the already beleaguered government.

Now, you asked what can be done to help them improve?

Honestly, I don't know. Part of the issue with the EU is that it's such a weird amalgamation of ""separate but together""; how you would attempt to fix a Germany or Norwegian economic problem is very different from fixing the Greek problem, they were caused by wildly different issues.

Generally speaking, consensus seems to be that government spending in a recession is [a good thing](http://hubpages.com/education/Government-spending-and-taxes-during-recession). There's certainly some economic merit to either side and I am far from an economics expert, so I will leave that to smarter people than I.

So cutting austerity and increasing spending in these governments, provided that they're actually used to help the economy and not pay [some of the rather absurdly generous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2010/02/greeces_generous_pensions) social programs or going [straight to the banks](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/business/bailout-money-goes-to-greece-only-to-flow-out-again.html).

Long term, what does this probably mean?

I genuinely don't think the EU can survive in its' current form. The governments and economies of all the various countries and systems are too wildly varied to work; a German work-heavy system is being asked to support a Greek social-welfare-heavy system and people will resent that (merely one example to make the point). Central banking systems will tend to work with the largest countries to prop them up for economic returns but what may work for a heavily industrial country does *not* work for a country that emphasizes tourism and non-industrial labor.

I think it's done this well so far because we're lucky in having a majority of MEP's who since they were able to start passing or voting down legislation as a body have a majority that sit in left wing and even socialist cross EU parties.

We've definitely stabbed it in the back. We had more than enough of a voice as one of the top 3 (or is it 4 now?) seat holders in the EU parliament to influence things... in the right direction. And of course when you get idiots like David Cameron going over there trying to force concessions for things that evidence doesn't even support then that's not the right direction so of course they'll push back. 

I guess it depends on who runs our country as to which way they would like to influence the UK. Right now that's not even the cards for us.",,felizesteban,t1_dd6uivb,worldnews,dd6voix,,1488469819,False,t5_2qh13,False

And since it's not like US support in a conventional war is the difference between defeat or victory against Russia, I really don't see where the ""meltdown"" would be.

Concerted positions would be approved in the European Council for Defence, CSDP and EDA's role would grealy expand to fill the gap caused by NATO, GDP spending with the military would likely increase for a handful of years to improve readiness of European armies, European arms industries would be much pleased, and then it's back to business.

t3_5rb25i,0,1485962605,,3,0,"Yes, well, let me try to answer, then.

&gt; This temperature and density differential plays a large part in creating the ocean currents around the globe.

Yes, but not the way you might think.  There are two factors at play, but the one that helps keep ocean currents moving is that surface waters at the poles cool, and cold water falls in relation to warm water.  The cool water falls, leaving space for warm surface water to come in to take it's place.  There are two ""rivers"" of water, or ocean currents, one on the surface and one at the depths.  As cool water moves away from the poles, and warm water moves towards the poles, this movement brings warmer water at the surface to the Arctic and Antarctic, where the water has a greater differential to transfer heat energy to the air and radiate it away to space, and also a lot less humidity (water vapor is a GHG), so more IR makes it to space from the poles than from tropical areas.

&gt;My understanding is that, for instance, without the warm water from the Gulf Stream, much of the North Atlantic including the Northern US and Northern Europe would be significantly colder than they are now.

Yes, you are correct.

&gt;Now, the issue I'm having trouble reconciling here is that if the temperatures around the globe are increasing, that will have a detrimental effect on the temperature and density differentials that cause the currents in the first place. 

Yes and no.  As the poles warm (mostly the Arctic), from very cold to merely really cold, the temperature differential will slow the cooling effect of cold air on the water, but the dry air will still cause the water to evaporate, and the lower humidity will still allow for greater IR escape, allowing for cooling via IR loss.  Remember that even at the equator, cooling happens pretty quickly as soon as the sun goes down, because the planet is radiating away energy based on its temperature in Kelvin.  Nights at the Arctic are longer, days are shorter, and peak solar input is less.

So, liquid water will still cool via evaporation, IR loss, and contact with cool air.  When the surface water cools to near freezing, and water just a few feet below the surface is warmer, an exchange will take place and the cooler water will fall, pushing the water below it ever deeper.  The conveyer belt will still happen unless the arctic gets to be warmer than the equator; and that's not going to happen.

What could happen is that the conveyer might slow as the Arctic warms, bringing less of the warm water to the Arctic.  Less warm water coming to the Arctic will retard the warming effect of the Arctic, causing the water to cool more.  It's a self-regulating system.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For example: when liberals argue for UBI people say stuff life ""yeah great idea"". When Milton Friedman argues for similar policies people lose their minds. ""What ? Friedman ? Do you want Pinochet in Europe ?""

There's a distinct difference between what they hope to achieve with hit though - the devil is in the details. When people like Friedman argue for it they aim to cut social security, while other people aim to deepen it. The outcome will be quite different depending on the goals of the people who do it. The same with, for example, a flat tax rate. If the aim is to make taxation more fair the total income will be kept stable, the reform will include taxes on income from capital, not just from labor, and an exemption per person will be included. If the aim is to lower taxes for the rich there will be no personal exemption, income from capital will retain its generally lower rates and the difference will be made up by cutting public services.

&gt;As a European this saddens me because in non European countries I travel to, countries like Canada, conservatism is a main trend in politics.

I get my news through subscribing to a few newsletters, and RSS feeds. This usually means, I will be bombarded with hundreds, and often the case, I will just read and share a few of them. I don't think you need to be informed on every single news, and it is really hard to keep up. When my friends talk about certain issues like Brexit, I would just get them questioning and I often notice that there is a lot of jumping and assuming.

In regards to Brexit for instance, I would just ask,*why do you think it is a very bad idea? okay, so how exactly does it impact trade and ties with EU? but aren't there also other European countries that are not in the EU, they seem to be doing quite well? how exactly does this affect international students? which visa in particular? aren't there other routes?...*

Its good to be in the loop and a subreddit I enjoy browsing through is /r/outoftheloop when I am not in the loop of certain issues.

If its anything, this [article](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/six-critical-questions-can-use-evaluate-media-content/) is handy in giving a guidance that one should have at the back of your mind with any articles you read. 

Sometimes, Buzzfeed write good content, and other times, NY Times write suspicious ones. But don't let an article make you distrust the whole website. Instead, process in your mind what you find is wrong/questionable about the article, you can even write a comment for further clarification from the author.

*  There are a lot of affordable IP cameras these days have about 35m of Night Vision range.  If you want to be able to positively identify a face from 35m, that may be a bit more difficult.  [A fixed 4mm lens camera](https://www.arcdyn.com/dart-1080p-fixed-lens-bullet-camera.html) can usually only ID a face from ~15m.  You could look into a [Varifocal Lens camera](https://www.arcdyn.com/arrow-1080p-varifocal-bullet-camera.html), but that would probably put you above your budget quickly.

*  Most IP cameras have Motion Detection recording as part of their basic analytics.  This means that you can tell your camera to record whenever it detects movement in the Field of View (you can also do 24/7 or even a schedule that alternates between Motion and Continuous.)

*  Most weatherproof cameras have Night Vision (IR).  If you are really concerned about having the very best Night Vision, check out some [EXIR Turret style cameras](https://www.arcdyn.com/slingshot-1080p-fixed-lens-turret-camera.html).

*  Both of the ones I've linked so far are rated to -30˚C - 60˚C.  

*  You are looking for IP and Power Over Ethernet.  This means you have to run a Cat5/Cat6 between your recording device and the camera, this carries the power to the camera and the video back to your recorder.

*  I would recommend getting an Network Video Recorder (NVR) for storing the footage.  For 2 cameras you would need a [4 Channel NVR](https://www.arcdyn.com/carbon-40-4-channel-network-video-recorder.html).  The model that I linked has a Built-In POE switch to power the cameras as well.  A 1TB drive would be plenty for 2 cameras.

*  We do have a complete [2 camera package](https://www.arcdyn.com/security-camera-systems/2-camera-hd-security-camera-systems.html) available, but it's a bit outside of the budget you mentioned.  You could get that system without a Hard Drive and buy your own WD Purple Surveillance Grade HDD for cheaper on Newegg or somewhere like that.  We offer a 10% discount for Reddit users as well:  Reddit10

This shit is insanely expensive, and mostly because of the cost of running the studies in the US.

We can't walk away from these hospitals and universities because we need the doctors (particularly the key opinion leaders), and they know this.  So they charge whatever they want and essentially tell us to shit or get off the pot.  
  
  Meanwhile, run the same study in Canada or Europe and the cost is significantly lower because of regulations on what institutions can charge for the various procedures.  The costs in the US get passed on to the consumers and pharma gets the bad rap for it.

Yeah thats was the idea behind the EU Parlament... but people don't care to vote ,and the turnouts of EU elections are horrible. Sure I agree with the ""more power to the people"" but you do realize that that would in term require more power to the EU instition (in current state this would mean more power to the EU Parlament) but country governments do not want that, because they want to be in charge of their own countries and they are quite happy with having a nondemocratic EU. 

&gt; And also, not all countries are opposed to the EU. Mine for example (Spain) passed the ""EU constitution"" back in 2005 by an 80-20 margin.

Erm most of the european countries are not against EU in general, but criticizing/blaming EU are easy political points for populistic parties, and given the rise of populism, the anti-eu movements are picking up. I mean if eu survives for long enough (couple more years) and UK actually exits for real (they still did not sign the a.50) I think it will become quite obvious how that was a bad idea for UK, and how it was just a stupid populist move.

t3_5rften,0,1485965002,,1,0,"So the story begins in 2002, 13 years old, when I first heard the new single from Red Hot Chili Peppers, I fell in love. A few years earlier, I had listened to the song Californication on TV a few years earlier and really liked the song (not caring for the lyrics at the time). When I went to school and learned that no one really knew who they were or liked them. So I looked up tour dates and they were making a stop in Toronto. After asking my parents for permission to go, they deemed me to young to go to a concert by myself. Especially one in the nature of grown men on stage with sox on cox. Needless to say I was disappointed, but got over it. I listened to the By The Way album to the point of wearing the CD into oblivion. When Stadium Arcadium came out I became obsessed all over again. I drove my family nuts with amount of times they heard Dani California, everywhere they went. Work, home, the car, the shopping center. My life was all about the chili peppers at this point, but never got the opportunity to see them. This is also the time in my life when I was really into gaming and most of my teenage job income was going to that.  

Fast forward a year, and I had gotten into the drug scene and my taste in music was fluctuating all over the place. But my life changed when I went with some friends to the Daft Punk Alive Tour. The lights, the atmosphere, and the music was just insane! We experienced a whole new level of awesomeness that day! We were all into the band beforehand but this put it on another level for all of us. The weeks following the concert were the best high ever. We kept playing all the music ALL the time. This really put my focus of music into electronic, and dance music. My years in college I saw all of the electronic artists I could. My school did a great job in getting some big names to come to the school (Aoki, MSTRKRFT, and DVBBS[when they were still called DUBBS, one them went to my school actually]), so that helped out quite a bit. Once I got out of college and out of the influence of wanting to party all the time. I grew out of electronic music pretty quick. I still like the music and will listen to it, but I definitely liked it better when I wasn't sober. 

It was now 2013 I had realized that I hadn't seen my all time favourite band, Red Hot Chili Peppers, at all. So when I looked up their tour schedule at the time, they were in South America and then to Europe. No signs of North America. So again I was pretty bummed, so I subscribed to everything chili peppers, for any indication. I got a hit a few months later when Flea said, in an interview, that he would like to see the band with a new album by the end of the year and touring by the spring of 2014. This gave a bit of hope for me. Spring of 2014 came around and there was no word of a new album yet. Only that they have been going into the studio. 

Once they finally released the news that they were coming out with a new album and touring for it, I was excited as a little girl at this point! When The Getaway came out, it gave a new appreciation for Klinghoffer and his musical ability. So I went online and looked for a North American tour date close by. As luck would have it they were playing at Bluesfest in Ottawa. My girlfriend and I got tickets for the event the day they came out. Bluesfest, for those who don't know is a huge multi stage outdoor concert festival. This year's main acts included Chili Peppers, Nelly, Duran Duran, Cage the Elephant, City and Colour, and Common. 

The day of the concert was here and it wasn't the best looking of days, being over cast for most of the daylight hours. As night began to fall and the band coming on in 3 hours, so we decided to head over to the festival and get some good seats. As luck would have it, we are close to the first people in the stage area. So we set up for the long haul to stay in that spot for the next five hours. So we take turns getting the drinks and going to the bathroom so that we didn't lose out spot. Within an hour the area was filling up quite nicely, so no more bath room breaks. (I told myself, if you can do LOTR at the theatres you can do this). 

After waiting there and being squished to no end, the band finally came on. My jaw absolutely dropped to the floor. I was standing infront of my idols ready for them to play for me and the other 1000's of people that were there. I had been waiting 13 years for this moment, and it was everything plus more that I could think of! The energy from the band is incredible, even when they're pushing 55! Well, 3/4! Throughout the whole concert I had such satisfaction that I couldn't believe that it was actually real. 

So needless to say that, that was my all-time favourite concert, and I'm going to do it all over again when they come to Toronto in 3 days!!!

You'll usually find that your ""upgrade"" is to a room on a higher floor or with a better view if you're traveling during peak business traveler times. If you're traveling on the weekends in a city where there isn't high business traveler demand (think DC on a winter weekend), then your chances of being upgraded to a suite go up exponentially in my experience. 

Generally though your best bet is to wait and ask when checking in at the desk. I usually just ask in passing if my diamond room upgrade happened to clear for this stay. Some agents give me a dirty look when I ask, others are happy to type away at their computer to see if there is anything they can do for me. I've heard of some people pulling out their phones to show that the hotel is still selling suites for the stay dates and essentially demanding that they be upgraded into that room, but I personally don't care enough about a suite upgrade to pull a DYKWIA like that. YMMV though.

Oh, and if it's a special occasion trip, I always reach out to the hotel GM/Manager ahead of time and explain that it's a special trip so anything they can do to make it that much more special would be greatly appreciated. That has always gotten me a suite upgrade and usually either wine, beer or champagne waiting in the room with some fruit or sweets - all comped.

That's why most of my vintage German watches came from ebay.de, and with some patience and experience it's more or less a great place to buy German watches. Many German sellers only accept bank transfers and only ship to Germany, but they are typically open to shipping to other EU countries if you inquire via a private message - that's where the basic German skills really come in handy, because it seems to warm up the sellers when they see you're at least trying to use the language.

LI emphatically believes illegal immigrants have no excuse. They should just do it legally.

Firstly, if you want to not get immediately tired of the game again, don´t get the ALB Dios team, unless you want to have something that can kill any dungeon you´d want to farm with the click of a button each floor (it´s a matter of perspective, really, but it´s so unappealing to me that my Liu Bei is still not even on my to be evolved schedule.).


For teams I can recommend: Krishna is now very strong as a red mono color row team with great consistency for Arena 1, probably also Arena 2, not sure about 3. (There´s also Awoken Cao Cao who´s literally red ALB)


For blues you´ve got a really great box but not really any leaders worth mentioning apart from Skuld if you´d really want a blue team. If you could get your hands on Summer Myr in ~June (8* collab REM or 500k MP) you´d have a very solid team for her though, but she´s got no major advantage over the free light version (most people argue that she´s worse, you can hardly deal with Gaiadragon in A3 for example), but it´s something to keep in mind. There´s enough solid blue leads to pull that you could easily pick up with your sub choices!



Green teams to invest in are Bastet and Awoken Kushinada Hime, both combo leads, the latter being restricted with a no skyfall effect (perfect damage control being a perk of that!) and Bastet being restricted to active use. There´s also Kaede who you might find a bit difficult to sub though (she´s a great sub for the other two teams though).



Light is where your box really shines, since you´ve got a great team for Myr, a fully farmable lead that is currently ruling the top tier of leads since her release (somewhere 8-9 months ago...). You could clear her dungeon on your own or grab a coop partner to even carry you through (see your server´s respective discord, I´m from EU) and once she´s yours (and evolved, it´s a pain in the butt), you can strap on Apocalypse, ADQXQ, Wu Kong and Venus and you´ve already got yourself a top tier team, plus some very good inherits to use as well.



For dark you´ve got AAnubis if you´re REALLY into combos (new Revo can get you a x900), otherwise you could get Typhon´s Ana (look for a PADX dungeon that features her as a boss rotating through) and invest into that team if you´re into heartcross leads, she´s not that great though.",,deviant324,t3_5rg9v7,PuzzleAndDragons,dd6zul0,,1488472230,False,t5_2w23a,1485980294

t3_5reqo3,0,1485966789,,3,0,"Vou repetir uma explicação que dei em outro comentário (que creio ser crucial pra entender o pichador) e em seguida vou responder o seu.

Eu queria que as pessoas, antes de começar esses debates, entendessem 2 características fundamentais de todos os (tipos diferentes de) pichadores: 1 - Ele não se importa com legalidade, com o que as outras pessoas taxam de moral ou imoral. Ele faz o que ele quer. A multa não vai educar nem o pichador de 12 anos nem o pichador de 45 anos. 2 - O pichador não se importa nem com a própria vida, e quem me explicou isso e o que eu vou dizer a seguir isso foi um próprio pichador. Todo dia tem pichador subindo em prédio abandonado pra pichar fachada e todo dia tem pichador caindo e morrendo, e eles sabem disso e continuam fazendo. Eles só querem deixar uma marca, mesmo sabendo que ela depois vai sumir, o reconhecimento social entre seus amigos é uma das poucas coisas que eles prezam. Eles não se importam realmente com nada, nem em cair lá de cima e acabar matando alguém que tá passando embaixo. Tu acha que uma pessoa dessa vai ser incomodada por visita a tribunal e burocracia e multa e emprego forçado? **Não vai se importar nem com pena de morte** - pichar é, como eu disse, quase uma pena de morte presumida (""Sei que posso cair de lá de cima, meu amigo caiu ontem e morreu, eu não me importo""). O pichador *em geral* é apático a isso tudo, indiferente.

O buraco é muito mais embaixo, e como eu falei o poder público cisma de tapar o sol com a peneira. O poder público (e não é exclusivo do Doria já que muitos governantes são assim) aqui está fazendo teatrinho ""pra inglês ver"" apenas. Vamos ao problema? A desigualdade social e econômica deixa um setor enorme da população à margem da sociedade. Gerações de pessoas desamparadas e ignoradas, esquecidas pelo poder público. Com o tempo entendem que o poder público não é para elas e não lhes traz nenhum benefício, se tornam totalmente indiferentes a ele. Daí chegamos aonde queremos: o descaso total com a coisa pública + a vontade de ser visto (através da sua marca que vc pintou no alto de um prédio). Só que pra solucionar isso vc tem que voltar lá atrás, na desigualdade social e econômica - qualquer outra intervenção que não seja nesse nível será desperdício de tempo e dinheiro. E com os prédios todos pichados, mais e mais pessoas (de outras classes sociais) se juntam a isso, por outras razões - rebeldia, romantismo com a figura do pichador, etc.  
Se vc pega uma máquina dessas e injeta umas multas aqui e uns empregos ali, nenhuma diferença faz pô, nenhuma. Quando é que o estado vai encarar isso de frente, e não com paliativos e tapando o sol com a peneira? Dar uma multa de 50 mil, dar um emprego forçado, até dar uma pena de morte (!), nada disso é solução e nem vai deixar a sua cidade menos feia, pq nada disso age na causa do problema. Se vc quer que eu diga, bem explicadinho, como se resolve a desigualdade social e econômica, foi mal eu não posso. Isso aí era o Doria que tinha que te responder.

All of this was done under a ""emergency ordonance"". TBH this wouls have been totally fine, but it was enforces unfairly and he just shoved all his political oponents in prison, not to say they didn't do corrupt shit, but everyone stole and somehow, by pure coincidence, only the opposition party was getting in prison. 

Fast forward 1 and a half years and the supreme court just ruled all of those ordonances severely unconstitutional, like, violating equality under the law and the presumption of innocences levels of unconstitutional. 

Fast forward a few more months and parlamentary election season rolls around, the socialist party (the main opposition party to the president) runs on a platform of reforming the justice system and they win the most overwhelming parlamentaey victory in Romanian history, so overwhelming that it was the first time any party did not need to forn a coalition in order to govern, with the president's party winning a mere 20% of seats. 

Fast forward a few more weeks, and Romania is getting sanctioned by the european court because our prisons are so fucking inhumane because they are overpopulated. 

So then, in light of this sanction, the parliment passed the resolution reforming the criminal justice system and literally the only things changed where the things deemed unconstitutional. Most of it was to do with the presumtion of innocence and the power of law enforcement, but the most argued about thing was the change to workplace abuse (that's abusing your position not your co-workers, it's a pain in the ass to translate technical Romanian language) where, AS STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION of the country, damages of less than 200 000 RON (about €45 000) are a civil offence, not a criminal one, hence you are not a felon and you will be prosecuted in a civil court, have to pay back damages, etc. 

Beyond this, they passed amnesty to all non-violent criminals serving minor sentances, something less than 2 or 5 years, not 100% sure. So it's not like they just got theie buddies out, the people who stole millions have sentances of 30 years, they are staying where they are. 

And now the president is going on the news calling for riots.

Muchos análisis aquí relacionaban la bajada de apoyos a Podemos con la moderación de propuestas electorales desde las europeas, sin fijarse en que el CIS mostraba todo lo contrario: en los primeros meses de éxito mediático de Podemos, con Pablo en laSexta todos los días, el CIS mostraba que la gente colocaba a Podemos en una posición más centrada y moderada, coincidiendo con el pico de apoyo electoral en las encuestas. Luego vinieron Ciudadanos y la masiva campaña de descrédito mediático con el facebook plagado de vídeos antiguos de Pablo o Monedero diciendo lo bolivarianos que se sentían o cualquier historieta por el estilo, junto con las polémicas de Monedero con Hacienda o Errejón con la Universidad... El apoyo en las encuestas cayó junto con la percepción de Podemos en la escala ideológica del CIS hasta ser vistos como más radicales que IU. Algunos aquí interpretaron que la bajada de apoyos tenía con la moderación en el programa, cuando la realidad es que la inmensa mayoría de la gente no se lee los programas electorales y que el CIS mostraba todo lo contrario, que Podemos se había radicalizado a ojos de la gente.

The EU has the negotiating power to tell mobile companies, or facebook, or any other multinational corporation, to fuck off if they don't play by the law, or don't pay taxes. Individually they can't do this. If a multinational corporation decides that they want to dodge taxes, or avoid fines, or raise prices, they can threaten to find a country that will let them. 

You see this played out in tax avoidance. We know that companies like Apple dodge billions of taxes. The EU, by presenting a united front against tax dodging corporations, make it hard for companies to find tax shelters if they want access to the huge European market. Without united negotiating power, individual countries have to play whack-a-mole, a game that they're almost certainly going to lose.

3) It's also why TPP was so bad.  Because the current things the US is really good at (also thanks to a lot of legal migration from india) is software engineering and silicon Valley type initiatives. If TPP went through the US government would open up these companies to operating in the Pacific rim on the condition that they would follow and respect patent rights. Which is essentially unenforceable there. So all it would mean is those traditionally secure jobs such as software engineer, and anything silicon Valley or comp Sci related, would just be copied and upended in Asia.

I am anything but eloquent with words or an expert on this topic. I much rather link the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_lobbying

a short but info packed article by politico from 2009: 

http://www.politico.eu/article/why-lobbying-in-america-is-different/


Those links are for the bulk of information. I just talk about some differences here and hope i don't mess up:


And list some things that are important: European politicians do not have to finance costly re election campaigns, they try to balance interests rather than bank accounts, as far as i am aware. Also, there is absolute transparency. Then there is the aspect of representing countries rather than states, a company will not suddenly pull out their factory if the EU does not approve a law they prefer. In the US, a governor has to take into consideration what the local corporations do. From time to time there are problems with transparency. It is considered a problem when people have to request information of lobbying meetings rather than those informations being released without request. Compared to US lobbying in which the public never will learn what is being talked about behind closed doors, what Clinton for example did in Morocco for her $12 million for example, Trumps tax returns still not being released, and countless more levels of lobbying below that, ranging to even Judges being lobbied, i think its fair to say that the EU lobbying is better in terms of transparency.

Looking at the recent hot topic of the F-35 fighter. The manufacturers like Boeing and Lockheed Martin spread their production plants around multiple states to gain influence in them, instead of only in one location and thus having no influence. This is a big reason why they are as influential as they are in the US. 

But this is the comparison between EU and US, which is a bit flawed considering. If you look at individual European countries, there very well might be a difference. In Germany for example, a political party does not need big chunks of money to produce TV ads. Every party gets one AD, thats it. That gives them freedom from having to sell out their souls to finance themselves. Frances Marine Le Pen on the other hand is linked to be taking money from Russian investors and looking at her anti European stance it makes sense. Regardless of if those money sources want anything from her or not, she works towards something the Russians have as goal, weakening the EU. No money in politics, less lobbying. 

If a region has to be scared of Russia, its the EU not the US. But thats another topic.

Anyhow, if i made any error please feel free to correct me so i can change it. Both links are informative and short, giving a short insight on this topic.

One thing that people from developed countries might not realize is, it's not easy for a country to be stable. A lot of things might happen. Coup d'etat, run on the banks, currency control (quota on withdrawing USD, force one to use ridiculous ""official rate""), sudden change in exchanging rate, refugees from a neighbor country, even wars and military conflicts.

For example, Turkey might be a favorite place to retire to for many British and German, before 2015. But in 2016 we do see things like coup d'etat, bombs, ISIS-related terrorist activities etc. Some people might still want to retire over there, but definitely not as much. Also, the currency devalues, and well as properties over there. 

Say the probability a western European country being kinda unstable is like 0.1%, the probability of such things happen in a SE Asia country might be like 5%. That's a huge difference when you plan things for like 40-50 years (e.g. retiring in mid twenties).

Even if you don't encounter any instability mentioned above, things in Asia changes faster than Europe, and the premise of your decisions might simply disappear and you will need to reevaluate everything.

(Human - Urban Fantasy, sword and shield, magic and staff type era)

Samal was born a peasant in the large sprawling metropolis of Edamanun, the capital of the Edamanian Empire. He spent his young life in the slums of Edamanun, known as the Shanty Hills, as the slums consisted of shanties building built atop even more shanty buildings, rising and falling like steppes. His Mother a disgraced Professor, she had been accused of teaching ideas that were critical of the Empire. An accusation made by a rival Professor who had wished to gain traction within the University. Despite the Imperial Investigators finding no wrong doing and even pointed out that criticism of the Empire had not been considered treason for at least twenty seasons. The Head of the University however was stuck in the ways of the old Empire and the old Emperor, he vowed he would have none of it and had her degrees nullified and stripped her of title. She was unable to find work elsewhere, no one had use of a Professor with no degrees. So she sought work the only place she could and began teaching in a place where no one wanted to learn. 


So she moved to the slums. She found her love there in a blacksmith of some skill, born and raised in the Slums he refused to leave there and used his skills to better the community. Samal had a happy childhood, as much as one could in the Slums, he was homeschooled by his Mother and therefore usually much more intelligent than his counter parts. It also lead to more fights and that is where his Father's teachings came in. His mostly happy life continued until his 10th season. When his mother and father were repaid for their kindness to the community, when they were robbed and murdered in their home. Imperial Investigators had come to Samal's, which was odd for the Slums usually no one investigated crimes here, but the community was in such an uproar that the Imperial Guard decided it was best to appease them.


Upon investigation they found nothing of value was actually stolen and it seems that multiple men had stormed the house and at least one was wounded badly. However, it was hard for them to obtain more information as too much time had passed. One of the investigators noticed little Samal there in the house by himself. He could not take Samal himself, but he knew somewhere he could go. Somewhere better than the Slum orphanage where he would either starve, become sick, or become a criminal himself. 


The Imperial Army, they often took young children in as serving boys. Cleaning armor, stables, pouring wine for Officers, doing whatever needed to be done. Samal joined their ranks. For 3 seasons he spent cleaning, repairing, learning the basics of soldiering, cleaning some more, and serving those around him. He stood out from his compatriots though, he showed cunning, an ability to learn, and motivation that some of the others lacked. At the age of 13 he became a boy-squire to a high ranking Officer. His duties were to assist the squire in assisting the Officer. When the squire became of age and went to serve in the Army proper, Sam became Squire. Eventually following the same path and being promoted to a Junior-Officer position in the Army. He was 20.


Sam distinguished himself in his first campaign and soon was put in charge of an entire platoon of spears, as a First Officer. He continued his Military career for several more campaigns before applying to be moved to the Imperial Guard. His aspirations had always been to become an Imperial Investigator. After many seasons away, Sam finally returned to the city he was raised in, Edamanun. Much to his irritation though, Investigator was something you had to prove through service in the guard. So he started at a boring desk job, but with Sam being Sam, it did not take him long to find opportunities to prove himself. 


Finally at his 30th season, Sam was awarded the black overcoat of the Imperial Investigator. 

Four years later, Sam finds himself being assigned back to his former home in the Shanty Hills. A slew of gruesome murders have been plauging the area for quite some time, with resources pulled tight, the Empire has not been able to spare any resources to investigate these murders properly. However, murders with the same modus operandi have begun to appear in the business districts and most recently and importantly in the household of a noble. All of the organs removed, the eyes and eyelids removed, and replaced with gems, the insides replaced with various trinkets, and the body sewn back up. Seemingly no pattern in the victims age, race, affiliation, status, or gender. Rarely signs of struggle. 

With the death of a noble lady, this matter has suddenly became pressing to those in power. So Sam has been sent on the case, with a fresh cadet assigned to follow him along.

Sam has a pouch of gold, a longsword, a buckler, a dagger, a sap, a set of lock picks, an eyeglass, a small pouch for one days provisions (he is in a city, he normally just pays for accommodations), breast plate armor with a black overcoat worn over it, parchment, and a magical quill (it just always has an inked tip).

In school, you probably learned about the subject and the object of a sentence. Well there are actually two ""types"" of subject. The subject of an *intransitive* verb, which means they aren't doing an action *to* anything, like in ""I ran,"" and the *agent* of a transitive verb which *is* doing the action to something, like in ""I see the dog."" Some language actually treat the subject of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive one. They might have different understandings of things, but it still fits fairly well with our Indo-European concepts of the subject and object. This is called ergative-absolutive alignment.

Tagalog doesn't do that. I actually described Basque and the Caucasian language family. Tagalog and the other Austronesian languages use something so different and so unique to the family that it's literally called Austronesian alignment.

EDIT: A recent example from /r/languagelearning for what ergative-absolutive alignment sounds like is ""Her ran"" instead of ""She ran""",,RazarTuk,t1_dd75o7f,AskReddit,dd75xop,,1488475733,False,t5_2qh1i,1485973568

Illegal immigration of the form that's happening in Europe cannot happen here because 1) it's hard to physically get here other than through legal means and 2) Latin American countries aren't accepting refugees/Muslims at a rate that would lead to a significant influx across the border (seriously, show me a shred of evidence that that's happening other than from Trump's twitter feed). 

And what fucking measurement for financial stability would you like to use to back up your backwards-ass claims that they do not help? Do you wanna use an anecdote? Because I can help you with that: why don't you sit your stupid ass down and have a look at Germany and their current financial state (yes they're spending more, but damn do they have a fuckton more production and economic gains). Please tell me exactly where that problem is. They ARE paying taxes once they come here or to Germany. There are such things as refugee help programs, but they provide a ton more output than input.

And the ads? Great! That's illegal immigration that CANT FUCKING PHYSICALLY HAPPEN TO AMERICA BECAUSE OF THE ATLANTIC FUCKING OCEAN. Also, I checked up on that, evidently you read infowars (did you even check the sourcing? They tend to make shit up and overblow it as if it's how everyone thinks that's not with them).

Xenophobic is about the foreigners, and Arab is an ethnicity, dipshit. It should be implied seeing as how closely related being Arab and Muslim are (not exactly the same, but close), but I know it's hard for your small brain to extrapolate, so I guess I should spell it out for you completely next time. Maybe we need to come up with another ""-ism"" to describe religious discrimination? I'd rather not since it should've been obvious from context, but I guess we can if you're that dense.

Next, I would gladly visit one of the (non-war torn) countries, but unfortunately, the west has been dicking around in the Middle East since WWII and creating chaos that still exists today.

I do recall that pretty much every time a new round of immigrants starts coming here, the ""true Americans"" (whatever the fuck that means) get angry and start persecuting that group (from the Chinese to the Japanese to the Irish to the Germans to the Jews to the Eastern Europeans to the Mexicans) then it, who would've guessed it, turns out that they were alright afterwards. This is just another round of asshats complaining about foreigners that aren't going to do anything but add to the mixing pot that is the US.

Disagreeing with facts is a bit irrelevant. [Here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/26/the-problem-with-scotlands-desire-to-be-in-the-eu-they-wouldnt-be-accepted-as-members/#5190488a1e98) is an article outlining that Scotland's deficit does not meet with required EU standards and therefore wouldn't be allowed to join. If that were ignore and Scotland were let in anyway, well that would be breaking their own rules and is against what the EU and its supporters claim to stand for: fairness (or something). You'd also have to adopt the Euro, which is a failing currency.

&gt;UK as a whole hasn't been able to meet all of it either.

Decades ago we joined a common market that didn't have this sort of regulation. This is somewhat irrelevant now as the whole system has changed almost beyond recognition.

&gt;Scotland is the only country in the world where oil is made out to be a burden.

Absolutely not true, oil is good for any economy, but the North Sea is not capable of sustaining an entire country's economy and is a finite and fast dwindling resource, many operations are already winding down. Combine that with dramatically lower oil prices than at the time of the Scottish referendum and there's an even weaker case for independence, economically speaking.

&gt; changing income tax bands, corporation tax, investment in renewable energy 

Noble causes, sure, but how exactly would you manage corporation tax, for example? [The EU wants to standardise corporation tax](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11630468/France-and-Germany-behind-plans-for-common-EU-corporation-tax.html) (presuming 'independent' Scotland would be in the EU) which is great for countries like France and Germany with high rates (30-33%) and terrible for Ireland (12.5%). Wherever you fall on the spectrum it removes your control and therefore limits how competitive a country can be in attracting businesses.

And yeah you caught me, I'm a pretty cynical person so I'm sure they do good things for Scotland, but independence seems to be rather a flagship issue for them as they keep bringing it up. However polls [here](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/davidson-now-more-popular-sturgeon-scotland/) and [here](http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-vote-in-the-in-a-scottish-independence-referendum-if-held-now-ask#line) show that the majority still want to stay in the UK.

Also, forgive me, but the idea that Scotland would be independent while out of the UK and in the EU is laughable. You would be sacrificing a strong, albeit not perfect, relationship with England (a stones throw away) for a relationship with what is essentially a clingy girlfriend who makes you pay for it. Brussels (not a stone's throw away) are pushing for an EU army and federalisation, not focusing on what is best for any individual country.

* due to his conviction, Dragnea was ineligible for the role of Prime-Minister, but he installed someone from his party as his personal puppet (this of course is debatable as noone will openly admit to that, but in all the press conferences Dragnea calls the shots while the Prime-Minister just nods)
* one of the first things the new Prime-Minister and his Cabinet pushed for was to change the law concerning inmates (some of our jails are overpopulated and there are notes from the EU to do something about it) - that's because Dragnea already is accused in another trial of defrauding the state of €24,000 and the trial is on 14th February (there are quite a few changes to the law, each one affecting different politicians but the one concerning Dragnea is raising the bar for when you can be tried for abuse of power to more than €44,000 thus annulling the above trial)
* meanwhile the population knew what was going on and have held protests multiple days in many cities, totaling more than 100,000 people, also attended by our President who is against this law (and so are all the people in the judiciary system)
* so they passed a decree in the middle of the night, at about 10PM and then immediately published it at 1AM last night, that directly helps their boss, and many other high-profile politicians, that defrauded the state by more than €1 bn and the state will not be able to recoup those losses anymore
* there are again more than 100,000 people in the streets (80,000 in Bucharest and tens of thousands in a few other cities) protesting the law

* aside from the politicians that get to be released and the €1 bn lost, there's a higher risk, with €6.5 bn being budgeted this year for 'Regional Development' that can be defrauded without any fear because of the current law that decriminalizes (for a large part) the abuse of power of officials

[FansUnite](https://fansunite.com/profile/CBN180)


Well, the Houston spread definitely covered so I'll keep running and paying attention to that system in the future. The over failed but it'd be tough to predict that bad of an offensive performance from Sacramento.. Here's Wednesday's picks..


**Picks:**

**Atlanta ML (2.02) (2 Units)**

Wow, this is somewhat tough to do against a surging Miami team (8 in a row!?!?) but I don't see how Atlanta drops this one. Miami is super reliant on scoring in the paint and Atlanta boasts one of the best rim defenders in Dwight Howard and have players at other positions who deny their match-up from getting to the rim (Schroeder, Bazemore, Sefolosha and Millsap).. 

Key Stats:

- Miami is the 4th most reliant team in the NBA on points in the paint and Atlanta gives up the 2nd fewest PITP per 100 possessions (39.0)

- Atlanta is 9-4  SU against teams with 18 and 19 wins (similar win percentages).. I find this relevant because they tend to not drop games they shouldn't.. 

**Minnesota +7 (2 Units)**

Cleveland has been struggling and KAT should be a nightmare for them without K-Love.. Minnesota's bench is typically their weakness (least amount of points per game) but Cleveland's is currently 28th in bench scoring and that bench is even more thin now with the recent absence of Love and the older absence of J.R. Smith. Minnesota also has the 11th best three point defense and Tom Thibodeau coaching so I think they should do a good job on LeBron and co. defensively. 

Key Stats:

- Cleveland 2nd most reliant team on three ball (34.9% of points) and Minnesota is 11th best at defending it.

- Minnesota had won their last 4 ATS as dogs before going on a huge run of games (6) where they were favored.. They have struggled ATS as favorites but I believe this is a slight over-correction for a team that is finding their groove right now.


**OKC ML (1.65) (1 Unit)**

Goatbrook gonna eat against that poverty paint defense of the Bulls. Thunder are terrific at home and I can't see them dropping this one SU. The Bulls have allowed the last three point guards they have faced: McConnell of Philly, Schroeder of ATL and Dragic of Miami to go for 17, 24 and 26 respectively. Dragic's game is a similar rim-attacking style so I'm predicting Westbrook to go for **AT LEAST** 35 in this one on national TV and a heavier burden on him without Kanter. Going to hold at one unit though until we see OKC take care of business tip to buzzer without Kanter.


**Dallas -6.5 (1 Unit)**



**Milwaukee ML (3.73) (1 Unit)**

Utah has been struggling lately and Milwaukee is a hit or miss team. I think Giannis and Parker provide huge match-up issues in this one and the perimeter defense of Brogdon, Delly and Snell could be big in this one. Gobert does protect the rim well so that will be a challenge but I like the value of Milwaukee here as they have the talent to beat about anyone but suffer greatly with inconsistency. 


**May add a play on the LA-PHX game or Charlotte-GSW game but we'll see how things are looking**

1st add (730 PM CT) **Phoenix +2.5 (1 Unit)** - wishing I didn't play LA on my degen parlay.. Think Phoenix's guards will be way too much here and I don't see anyone on LA stopping them, especially when you look at their bench guys and the fact that Austin Rivers started at PG last game.. Not sure if Blake or DeAndre are going to be able to do enough here to take one on the road. Considered a 2 unit play, but going to stick with 1 since it's a late add. Cheer$. 


Also just added **Russell Westbrook over 29.5 points for 2 units** - not counted into an official record
