But let's actually address this. I am not pro-Communism. Communism is an ideology in which all property is publicly owned, there is no money, and there is somehow magically no state despite the fact that a massive central government is required to actually distribute resources in a moneyless society. It is a ridiculous, naive, unimplementable fairy tale utopia at best, and IMO the idea of having ALL property be communal is an affront to human dignity.

However, I suspect that you are using ""commie"" as a slur for any vaguely left-wing economic idea you disagree with, possibly including shit like labor safety laws and a minimum wage. So, since I support a more European-like economic system where higher taxes with a progressive bracket system are used to maintain an extensive social safety net, I'm going to go ahead and say that by your definition, I am ""pro-commie.""",0,1,t1_dd5rtl4,MensRights,HotDealsInTexas,,0,t3_5qv2mt,,1485907254,

Eu sou encostado no INSS por invalidez, pois sofro de Esquizofrenia Paranóide.

Tenho 26 anos e sou solteiro, moro com meus pais e meu quarto é separado, moro no meio do mato e não tenho vizinhos.

A Esquizofrenia desencadeou a 5 anos atrás e vinha me causando muito sofrimento.

Vinha lutando contra a doença e suas sub-doenças, como Ansiedade e Depressão.

Até que descobri que a Cannabis Sativa (Maconha), reduz a minha Depressão e a Ansiedade praticamente a zero.

Ela me faz muito bem, sinto Bem Estar durante o tempo todo.

Faço uso a 6 meses e só tenho resultados positivos.

Sou remanescente dos filhos de Deus.
Em meus estudos, descobri que a erva nos foi dada por Deus desde a criação do mundo.

Disse Deus: ""Eis que lhes dou todas as ervas que nascem em toda a terra e produzem sementes, e todas as árvores que dão frutos com sementes. Elas servirão de alimento para vocês"". (Gênesis 1:29)

Descobri também que nada que ingerimos nos torna impuro:

""O que entra pela boca não torna o homem impuro, mas o que sai de sua boca, isto o torna impuro."" (Mateus 15:11)

That said, I love when Protestants cite natural law theory to satisfy their need to invalidate homosexuals and then go back to bashing those crazy Catholics and their Saint-worship. Personally, putting myself in a conservative's shoes, I think I'd find the scriptural references to homosexuality more convincing than natural law theory even as a Catholic. It's less messy. I personally reject both of these arguments, but the natural law rests on some premises that can be contested much more easily than the scriptures can.

Sort of a tangent, but we were talking in my European history class about how Aristotle's conclusions about the ""natural state"" of things were first questioned when people came in to contact with non-European people and realized that some of those universal truths were not as universal as they thought, and this helped set off the enlightenment because people started to question their traditional sources of intellectual authority.

_____________

Those may help answer your question, though I'll give it a brief shot. 

&gt;would you recognize any ethnic disparities amongst your population

In Europe, certainly. Germany for the Germans, Denmark for Danes, und so weiter. 

In America the different European ethnicities have largely blended to create a Pan-European identity, of sorts. The major differences between White people are largely ones of accent and some etiquette differences. I don't see that being an existential issue so much as cultural flair - much like North or South Germans. 

&gt;Is it the skin colour? Is it the cultural ethnicity?

Yes, to the first. As for the second, we see race (or Ethnicity, should you be European) as formative to identity. As such, a ""White Person"" is someone that can pass as White in whatever country they might be living in to the point that they don't disrupt the day-to-day life of locals negatively. You can, for example, move to the Southern United States as a Midwesterner without much trouble whatsoever. I couldn't, as a European-American, move onto a Native American reservation or into a historically black town and *not* disturb them. Looking different is enough to be toxic. The same can be said for non-Whites in White nations or areas, regardless of where they are born or their ""cultural ethnicity."" 

The issue is even more pronounced with immigrants because any attempt they make to ""assimilate"" will be a mockery of whatever local culture they've invaded. Could I assimilate to Pakistani or Afghani culture to the point that I wasn't permanently an alien in their eyes? Probably not. Why? Because, I am White.

It was once a supporter of fascism (some could argue; in some ways it still is) and praised both Hitler's Nazi party and Mussolini.
 
In 1993 they reported that scientists had found the 'gay gene' and that it could be used to predict whether or not an unborn baby would turn out gay, suggesting this gave the mother the option of abortion.

In 2009 days after the death of Stephen Gatley (boyzone member) and before his funeral the Mail published an article suggesting the coroner's report of natural causes was incorrect and it was Gatleys 'gay' lifestyle that killed him.

They whipped up anti-EU, anti-immigration hate during the EU referendum campaign and then seemed to sympathise with the man who murdered Jo Cox because he would lose his home to waves of immigrants.

Then there is their constant scaremongering, according to the Daily Mail literally everything in the world causes cancer. Then you have your regular tabloid stuff, fact checking takes a back seat to sensationalism, they simultaneously condemn paedophiles (yay) and count down to child stars 16th birthdays (not so yay).  

It's probably banned from this sub for completely different reasons, but I'm sure it's justified.

The seven banned countries (random FB commenter comment)  

Iraq  

Syria  

The two countries in which ISIS is geographically located. ISIS is an abbreviation for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
Iran (this one i dont agree, but end of day, they are bankrolling the militia in Syria,Iraq and yeman)
An enemy of the United States, one of George W. Bush’s three “axis of evil” countries.
Libya  

Somalia  

Sudan  

Yemen  

Lawless countries (in other words there is no central government in control) that are prime recruiting grounds for jihadists.
People have asked why certain other countries aren’t banned. It’s because they don’t fall into one of those three categories. For example, although Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country, it’s not lawless, not an enemy of the United States, and not the location of ISIS.
If i had his powers and got into power on top of white american votes, i would do exactly the same...look at Malaysia on the other hand...we are letting a Salafist hate preacher Zakar naik speak at a mosque..while he is banned/wanted in so many countries for terrorism/hate speech
Its not a Muslim ban per se...Indonesia is the worlds largest muslim nation, its not banned...Malaysia, India, Pakistan all ok...
But if i was trump, what i would do diffrently...is i would add SA (the satan of all satan...root of all evil), Egypt (almost at non functioning nation level) and Turkey(semi dictatorship in conflict with PKK, kurds, syrians) in the list.

Racism is simply the belief in racial superiority. The word that you should of used is bigoted or prejudiced. 

Also, race makes up  50% of all hate crimes. 18 % of hate crimes are religiously motivated. About 65 % of those are against Jews. That is a small number of hate crimes. You used language to negate that fact. 

The Justice Department proves you wrong everyday. The Ferguson Report, Chicago Report, Innocence Project Report and many other recent events support the argument of continued white privilege. 

That said, there are other privileges: make, class and sexuality, religion. Hence, being a White Male, Straight, Christian is the ultimate level of privilege. 
The point is your argument assumes that classism does not exist, hence poor whites do not enjoy white privilege. That is wrong. 
Since beginning, the wealthy used racism to distract from the income inequality. White Privilege ""solved"" a problem that still plagues the USA. Now is their less white privilege. Yes.

Your colonial nation's merchants provide +2 trade power each, of which you get half. Basically nothing.

&gt;Also all the goods they produce will be transferred downstream to your own nodes (presumably).

Approximately half to 75% (rough estimate) of the goods produced will go to you, assuming no-one else has any power there.

&gt;If you own the provinces directly, they'll be 75% autonomy because they'll be territories (unless you state them, and it's rarely beneficial to do so in the New World when you have so much more development in the Old World).

You'll pretty much be stating as many provinces in the new world that you can, yeah.

&gt;And you'll never really develop them. If the CN owns them they get 0 autonomy provinces, which they can spend their own MP to develop and you get much larger benefits.

Eh. Per point of development you get: (!Tarrif)% of the production and tax income boost, (!trade power)% of the trade value, no manpower and no force-limit. Colonial nations will never develop enough to outgain the profits from owning the land directly.

&gt;Also, you are spending adm to core largely useless provinces, when you could have them doing it.

The provinces are not ""largely useless"". 10 development is 10 development. And 10 development with no ae (with anyone that matters) and no separatism (because primitives)

&gt;(from what I understand you have to do this quite early on, so you are wasting thousands of ducats over the course of a game).

As any nation likely to do a colonial exodus (Scotland, Irish-minors, Brittany, Granada, Norway, and possibly Portugal are the classic examples) the profit over the game will far, *far* exceed state maintenance.

&gt;Not to mention the costs for transporting your capital

It's a few hundred admin points, comparable to a no-cb war or two.

&gt;If they have no threats to deal with at home, they'll transport troops to you occassionally. At least that's been my experience. Their navies are also very useful, particularly against the likes of England, Spain and the Netherlands.

In 1750 hours of playing, I don't remember ever seeing colonial armies in Europe. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'd appreciate a screenshot. The navies are helpful, but if you own north and south america directly then you'll have the biggest navy in the world, and you won't have to depend on the ai to manage it for you.

I agree though things like veteran suicide, mental health and homelessness rates are pretty shocking considering how high the US regards it's military. Unfortunately most of your unemployment issues are structural (i.e the sectors where people are trained are no longer needed) which not even Trump can save, because they've been given up to Automated machines, so even if he brought back the car manufacturers the people who used to work there would have to retrain and there still wouldn't be a job for everybody who used to work.

Considering that the placement of military police was part of the state of emergency, I doubt they are there because of the possibility of rioters.

&gt;600-200,000 people isn't going to destroy their budget surplus

Here is the price of supporting a single refugee for a single year in Germany: [12,200 Euros](http://freewestmedia.com/2016/11/20/the-massive-cost-of-a-single-refugee-to-german-taxpayers/).

12,200 * 200k = 2.44 billion Euros per year.

12,200 * 600k = 7.32 billion Euros per year.

This is assuming that they continue to rely on the state and fail to find employment, [which seems to be the case](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/710927/million-migrants-Germany-unemployed-Merkel-open-door-policy).

That budget surplus dropped by ~6 billion Euros each year, it's absolutely plausible that the drop stems from having to support hundreds of thousands of people.

&gt;Go post in /r/de and ask what they think.

From what I've heard from other German Redditors, /r/de and /r/Europe are as far left as /r/Politics or farther. It's too biased to get a good sampling of Germans.

&gt;Yet again, we enter the territory of ""blatantly false"". The media didn't ""oversample"" anyone.

I don't see why oversampled polls are so utterly impossible. [Here is an email CCing John Podesta in 2008 (pre-HRC)](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26551) which states, and I quote (emphasis mine):

&gt;""I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend **oversamples for our polling** before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations **so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling**.""

Oversampling is a real thing. John Podesta was already acquainted with it by the time HRC ran again. If the polls were to predict the popular vote, that would be utterly retarded. Why would they waste so much time on predicting something that will hold absolutely no value? Polls are designed to show who is predicted to *win*.

&gt;Do you have literally any proof for this that isn't Breitbart or some right-wing blog?

[I think this should satisfy](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9154/germans-leaving-germany). There are some good, well-thought-out statements provided by the Germans who are leaving Germany. Here's one point that backs me up:

&gt;5) ""I believe that the German media is increasingly giving up its neutrality, and that freedom of expression in this country is only possible in a limited way.""

Additionally, I'm not talking about polls when I'm discussing Germans having to remain silent. I mean that they have to remain silent in regards to sharing their opinion on social media sites, or when with others. It's similar to being a Trump supporter in California, where you have to hide who you are for fear of bringing a verbal tirade down on yourself or losing friends, but with the added stipulation that you can go to jail if you say something too out-there.

&gt;Except you sat at +2 points, while he sat at 0. He didn't downvote you, you downvoted him.

In the UK we actually have a pretty good proxy for them in the UKIP who poll about 12%. With Trump at the helm I'd expect that to be half, which would put them only a few points ahead of the neo nazi fringe parties

I suspect some people, especially younger, monocultural people, just lack life experience with people of color, people of Asian extract, people of Eastern European extract, middle eastern people, white Afrikaners, tribal people, or any society where the majority doesn't look and act just like them.

Growing up, I was told to travel internationally. It would make me more human. I did as I was told and it worked. 

Add to this that we're having this conversation in a sub about writing; everyone here is fascinated with finding the right word and doing it fairly quickly. Some words come to mind and get entered into these posts; racism, bigotry, bias, racial guilt, fear of offending. I think these words are misplaced. The most common representation of black people, for those who haven't had the pleasure of knowing any, comes from TV and film. Think about the distortion that creates. My personality has more in common with Morgan Freeman than Tom Hanks. My political values are more in line with Cyndi Lauper than most everyone else. So are my role models a black man and a small white woman? No, I'm old enough to roll my own model, and I think that's one difference.

I have learned that I am no more a white person than I am a block of blue cheese. My skin isn't me. I am me. My love is like everyone's love. I am different in many ways, but that is the common ground I find.

My father was a bigot. He lived long enough to outgrow it and found a strong friendship with a black man. In my mind, this was my father's best achievement. Everyone became a little better for it. My suspicion is many young white folk fear the word bigot because they've never known one. Everything is left to what they've seen on a screen and their imaginations. We writers know how terrible leaving something to the imagination can be. I think this may be why some comments in this sub come off as embarrassed and reluctant. 

I don't think any writer should be embarrassed to ask anyone what their life is really like, and then portray that in a story. It does take courage, so that may be an issue for some. 

A writer can write eloquently and beautifully and compellingly about Polish ghettos, Indian reservations, internment camps, race riots, race struggles, race baiting, playing the race card, racial profiling, racial exclusion, and the unique sense of being home that one only finds when one is with their people.

 **comment content**: &gt; That's what those jihadi-nationalist organisations basically are.

They target any and all western nationals - beheading them when they get them. Now tell me how that would work in the westernmost nation in Europe.

&gt; The only thing that I said was certain to happen was that incidents like this lad or Khalid Kelly would become more frequent.

That goes without saying - you have foreign nationals in every war, from Ukraine/Donetsk, to Syria and Libya, the Congo to Yemen. Doesn't mean we should be fearing the rise of some mad Irish Caliphate. In this very post I've wrote about someone who my ma knew in Lurgan who was a commander in the Libyan revolution.

&gt; For an Islamic IRA you'd need: a sufficiently large population of Irish muslims to support it, jihadi-nationalist ideas to reach here and become rooted [ISIS aren't nationalist], enough tacit support from the Irish population in general, and another Troubles to produce a violent environment for it to thrive.

You'll never have tacit support from the Irish population, and a large enough radicalised Muslim population here. Furthermore, why would another troubles, presumably with Catholic and Protestant belligerents fighting over the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, encourage *muslims* to engage in jihadism? 

The reason ISIS were able to gain as much ground as they did in Iraq/Libya/Syria was due to the already major Islamic-sectarianism and history of violence in the region that proved a breeding ground for recruits wanting a chance at revenge or retribution. Weak governments with weak borders allowed mass trafficking of arms, foreign fighters, and cash (as well as major pumping of arms and cash from the US/UK etc). There was already a power vacuum in Libya and what was pretty much a non-Government in Iraq, with crippled and nearly nonexistent infrastructures in both countries. This is without even touching on the socioeconomic side of things - the young men that join these organisations in those countries, for the most part have zero opportunities and zero education, but are offered a wage and filled with propaganda promising 'glory' when they join. Or they've had family or friends killed by western strikes or dictators like Assad or Qaddafi that have made the lure of the gun more powerful.  You're lacking all of these things in Ireland.

The most ISIS or any affiliated terrorist groups can hope to achieve here are the same sort of sleeper cell/lone wolf attacks that have been happening in Paris or Berlin etc. Even then we're more secure because we're an island, which poses increased difficulty with smuggling in of arms, you'll not find them using dissident or paramilitary weaponry, and I doubt any of the gangs in Dublin will be wanting to sell them anything.

1. Alternative power solutions to prevent power outages from shutting down the nuclear power stations. I got the spiel from party members that I spoke to, about how shutting them down would allow for investigation to alternative sources, whenever I questioned about the period between shutting down and powering up something new, I hit a brick wall.

2. Boosting of the economy.

What we've got so far:

1. Illegal constraint on the opposition party; Its illegal in the sense that they've been declared guilty and had the assets frozen without evidence that those assets were obtained illegally. I'm not a lawyer, but I've been through the legal system a couple of times and my experience is a defendants assets cannot be frozen without evidence.

2. Shut down the only government body that can legally investigate her on grounds of corruption. Ironically the SID was set up by CSB, and it was this department who sent him to jail.

3. The new work week regulations, may be considered progress for the DPP. So far all I see is that item costs will rise, workers lose opportunities to earn more money, businesses can no longer operate in convenient hours, thus earn less money.

4. Prematurely severing business ties with China, before the south bound policy is in full effect. Tsai should have done what's needed to maintain business ties with China, while building up the south bound policy. She should also assist businesses on targeting Japan and South Korea.

5. Encouraging the fear of the wrath of China. People are talking about the threat of war again, since Tsai has very publicly antagonized China. She has no intention of actually going to war, but she knew her actions would rally up the faithfully and breath fear into the common person.

6. Move the presidential office. Twice I've read she's planned to move the presidential office, the first time was to Taichung, the second time was to Kaohsiung. So that she can be closer to the people. All I see is the expenses that would be required for this to happen.

7. Breaking up of Taipower. After growing up in Europe where commodities got broken up and privatized, I can't say that it helped European citizens at all. My father would disagree and has complete distrust for government controlled commodities, but after living in Taiwan for nearly 10 years, I would disagree. In Taiwan we easily get the best service and best prices on commodities, which go a long way to maintaining the economy.

As a foreigner I sometimes find it very hard to get factual information and the media is so polarized, you have to read as much as possible and draw a median conclusion to get anything close to what might the truth.

But so far, I don't see anything she does that will actually help the people of Taiwan.

Same for Islam...

You're a kaffir 

&gt;...towards the end of the Quran, kafir begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the mu'minīn (believers).

&gt;Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"" - An account that is borrowed from the Biblical story of Sodom. Muslim scholars through the centuries have interpreted the ""rain of stones"" on the town as meaning that homosexuals should be stoned, since no other reason is given for the people's destruction. (Inexplicably, the story is also repeated in suras 15:74, 27:58 and 29:40).
Quran (7:81) - ""Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you?"" This verse is part of the previous text and it establishes that homosexuality as different from (and much worse than) adultery or other sexual sin. According to the Arabic grammar, homosexuality is called the worst sin, while references elsewhere describe other forms of non-marital sex as being ""among great sins.""

Quran (26:165-166) - ""Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, ""And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing""

Quran (4:16) - ""If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone"" This is the Yusuf Ali translation. The original Arabic does not use the word ""men"" and simply says ""two from among you."" Yusuf Ali may have added the word ""men"" because the verse seems to refer to a different set than referred to in the prior verse (explicitly denoted as ""your women""). In other words, since 4:15 refers to ""your women"", 4:16 is presumably written to and refers to men.

A majority of muslim believe gays should be executed. Heck, they even throw gays off of roofs in many Islamic Countries.

&gt;Pew: 64% of Muslims in Egypt and Pakistan support death penalty for leaving Islam

&gt;Egypt and Pakistan aren’t the countries with the highest numbers, either. Topping the list at 78 percent are our good friends in Afghanistan. 

http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/01/pew-64-of-muslims-in-egypt-and-pakistan-support-death-penalty-for-leaving-islam/

&gt;In other areas, however, there is less unity. For instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.

The Clintons - Long time friends of Trump and the Rothschilds. Bill Spent multiple hours on the phone talking to Trump before he announced he was going to run. He was forced to convince Trump to run by the Rothschilds. This is evident in the Clinton email leaks, where hilary acts like a subservient lapdog to Lynn Forester de Rothschild.

&gt; ""In 1987 Donald Trump purchased his first casino interests when he acquired 93% of the shares in Resorts International.  Resorts International has a sordid history which began in the early 1950’s when it evolved from a **CIA and Mossad** front company which had been established for the purpose of money laundering the profits from drug trafficking, gambling, and other illegal activities. On October 30, 1978, The Spotlight newspaper reported that the principle investors of Resorts International were Meyer Lansky, Tibor Rosenbaum, William Mellon Hitchcock, **David Rockefeller**, and one **Baron Edmond de Rothschild**.""  
  
&gt; “In 1987, upon the death of longtime CIA front man James Crosby, the nominal head of Resorts International, up-and-coming young New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump stepped into the picture and bought Crosby’s interest in the gambling empire.”  
  
&gt; “Trump soon became a household name, with his colorful personality and his insistence upon naming a variety of luxury hotels, apartment houses and other commercial ventures after himself. But while the name “Trump” appeared in the headlines, the names of the real movers behind Resorts International remained hidden from public view.”  
[Source](https://americanfreepress.net/who-towers-behind-trump/)  
  
&gt; ""After quickly expanding the reach of Resorts International to Atlantic City in the final years of the 1980’s, Donald Trump found himself in financial trouble as the real estate market in New York tanked. The three casinos in Atlantic City, like other Trump assets, were under threat from lenders.  It was only with the assistance and assurance of Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. that Trump was allowed to keep the casinos and rebuild his threatened empire.""

Russia:  
  
&gt; Finally, I want to highlight a story that many people haven’t noticed. On Wednesday, Reuters reported (in great detail) how 19.5% of Rosneft, Russia’s state oil company, has been sold to parties unknown. This was done through a dizzying array of shell companies, so that the most that can be said with certainty now is that the money “paying” for it was originally loaned out to the shell layers by VTB (the government’s official bank), even though it’s highly unclear who, if anyone, would be paying that loan back; and the recipients have been traced as far as some Cayman Islands shell companies. Why is this interesting? Because the much-maligned Steele Dossier (the one with the golden showers in it) included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions. The reason this is so interesting is that the dossier said this in July, and the sale didn’t happen until early December. And 19.5% sounds an awful lot like “19% plus a brokerage commission.”

Whether deception is justified in war or not doesn't matter. What matters is whether or not the war itself is just. When you have Muslims committing mass acts of terror and imams calling for Jihad against innocent civilians, the war is unjust. The opinions of what a just war is to Islam doesn't matter.

* The executive did not ratchet away power from parliament to give to the EU. Parliament did that. Parliament voted for the ECA. Parliament voted for the acts that expanded the scope of legislation that could be recognised under the ECA. Parliament could at any time vote to undo it.

* the concept of ""superior law"", as he calls it, does not bind parliament. It merely makes it so that certain statutes cannot be repealed implicitly. Parliament can still declare them repealed explicitly if it wants to. This is actually an important development for a country with no entrenched constitution: it means that, at the very least, guarantees of rights cannot be disposed of quietly. The way he acts like this is some cruel imposition to destroy our constitutional order is pretty galling.

* there is no reason to think that this doctrine of ""superior law"" will go away with the ECA. The judgement that introduced it stated that it could apply to any statute of constitutional importance, such as the HRA or the Magna Carta. This remains good law even after the repeal of the ECA.

* There is nothing about having an uncodified, unentrenched constitution that gives parliament the power to do literally whatever the fuck it wants that protects prosperity, freedom of expression, rule of law, or any other of those important qualities he listed. If anything they will be *more* at risk once we're out of the EU, because the only thing standing in the way of parliament abolishing them is the principle of immunity to implied repeal for constitutional statutes.

I'll start with my nightly routine:

I rinse my face with warm water and use La Roche-Posay medicated face cleanser with 2% salicylic acid (it's pricey but its very effective for me).

After drying my face I apply Aargan Facial Grape seed oil to help brighten my red spots and keep my skin hydrated since the cleanser can make it pretty dry some days. 

I then treat any break out areas with Epiduo (I use it every night but only apply it to break out prone areas and not my whole face. So cheeks, chin, and forehead).

I also use Now Solutions- European Clay Powder face mask once or twice a week (it helps brighten the skin and minimize pores and it's pretty affordable at around $6!)

I used to use benzoyl peroxide and it was pretty effective but my skin became used to it. 

I also tried tretinoin Cream and several different types of face washes, but this current routine is what really helped clear my skin! 
I've been struggling with my acne for three and a half years so I'm so glad I finally figured out what works for me.
 
Mornings:

I don't really apply anything in the morning, just the Grape Seed oil if my skin is dry and I've been looking around for a sunscreen to wear during the day. 

I also stopped picking at my face, which after a while I realized made a BIG difference in my acne.

&gt; The U.K., which boasts of its &amp;quot;Special relationship&amp;quot; to the U.S., is said to be deeply concerned that Trump&amp;#039;s admiration for President Vladimir Putin will give Russia sway in eastern Europe, according to two senior officials, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

&gt; &amp;quot;While Trump&amp;#039;s new UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, was known as a conciliator in her past job as governor of South Carolina, she arrived at her new post last week with a stern warning indicating she&amp;#039;s ready to pursue Trump&amp;#039;s pugnacious stance at the world body. The U.S. will&amp;quot;have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well,&amp;quot; she told reporters.

There is a scenario in which the EU does get hit harder. The Eurozone is looking decidedly shaky, and nobody seems quite sure what to do about that. If fallout from Brexit sent the Euro over the edge that could make things decidedly worse for the EU. If the US decided to pile pressure onto that it could be worse still... European banks are not healthy at the moment. They represent a potential weak-spot.

Because one, you're mostly talking about Jumpmaster/Manaroo, and the Bounty Hunter ships are known by name probably pretty well to many old EU buffs. 
And two, this is kind of a focus of small reference pools here. So, XWM has pretty regularly now been focusing on ships which appear in Rebels or movies, and even if you aren't watching Rebels, stats show that between 1-2 million people are (per episode). 
The game version of Shadows of the Empire alone is reported as selling 1 million copies, and the YT-2400 also was featured in an episode of Rebels.
The original Star Wars Galaxies where weird outliers like the Syck, Decimator, etc come from also sold at least 1 million copies.
The TIE Defender was in DLC for the new Battlefront, and will be in Rebels, and I have no hard numbers on the Original TIE Fighter or other games it came from, probably because they keep re-releasing it but it's an incredibly critically acclaimed game. In 2007 IGN put it in the #3 slot of ""greatest PC games of all time"". Over 150k owners on Steam alone. In just TIE Fighter. 
While the original Rebel Assault II probably isn't as hot, the Phantom is available in the Expansion to Empire At War - a game with close to 1.5 million owners on Steam. 
Now, sadly, worst offenders probably are the bounty hunter 3 ships (JM5k, IG-2k and G-1A) along with the K-Wing, because they were primarily in novels and only visualized in supplementary materials - and apparently book sales numbers are privileged. But, the bounty hunter ships were in ""Tales of the Bounty Hunters"" which I've personally always heard as very well reviewed and liked, and K-Wings from the Black Fleet Crisis trilogy. Both of which originally were published in 1996, meaning they've been around longer than some X-Wing players and have a decent chance of percolating to a very wide audience. Especially back in the day, when books were your only real SW. 
Similarly, E-Wings first appeared in the Dark Empire comics (first published 1991) and then are mentioned in an impressively long list of Star Wars novels thereafter. Again, books/comics, so hard sales are hard to track, but this even has a visual reference in addition to very long history in the EU. 

Also, ""iconic"" ships like As and Bs (prior to rebels) had like, 5 minutes of screen time in one movie, tops. And while I'll readily admit more people have seen those 5 minutes than maybe consumed all that prior media combined, that's also way more than the amount of people who buy and play X-Wing, and should not be the only consideration for a ship. So just because you never heard of something invented in 1996 doesn't mean that's not stuff people wouldn't know of. X-Wing has never gone really super obscure.

Not that much is known about pre-Renaissance Congo other than what we know from the Kingdom of Congo, which is that it was, to quote Wikipedia, ""a highly developed state at the center of an extensive trading network. Apart from natural resources and ivory, the country manufactured and traded copperware, ferrous metal goods, raffia cloth, and pottery . . . The eastern regions, especially that part known as the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza (or in Kikongo Mumbwadi or ""the Seven""), were particularly famous for the production of cloth."" The Kongolese kingdom was one of the largest of its time, at around 155,000 square miles. 

Then it all went to shit.

The Portuguese met the Congolese in 1483, 9 years before the New World was discovered, just to give a time reference. The king of Congo converted to Christianity, and relations between the countries were generally improving. 

After colonies were set up in the Americas and some in Africa, the English, Dutch, Portuguese, and other European powers. (I'm gonna stop here for a sidenote to emphasize just the scale to which slavery, especially the Atlantic Slave trade, was absolutely horrible. Imagine waking up one day to learn that the leader of your town had _sold you off_ to a person whose skin color you'd never seen in your life, whose language you'd never heard of and whose intentions were ambiguous to you. Unless they were sold as well, your mother, father, or any siblings you have would never see you again. In return for you, the leader of your town is given a few bits of gold and maybe a gun. That's how much you know you're worth. This light-skinned man then grabs you inexorbably, without being able to say goodbye to your family, to the nearest port where you'd be put on a rusty, creaky ship with hundreds of other people, about a third of whom would die because of the cramped, dirty cells, and often ships would chain slaves to planks for the trip. Once you arrived and a third of you killed by disease or other people, you were auctioned off to more people whose language you didn't speak. Then, depending on how kind the slave owners are to you (in the vast majority of cases they're as kind to you as you are to a nearly empty bottle of toothpaste), you are going to work on this sugar plantation (usually) or other type of farm for the rest of your life, likely without ever leaving, and your children, who have been conceived out of love, maybe, but probably out of rape, will do the same as you. Fun!)

(Just thought this was cool) ""A common characteristic of political life in the kingdom of Kongo was a fierce competition over succession to the throne. Afonso's own contest for the throne was intense, though little is known about it. However, a great deal is known about how such struggles took place from the contest that followed Afonso's death in late 1542 or early 1543. This is in large part due to detailed inquest conducted by royal officials in 1550, which survives in the Portuguese archives. In this inquest one can see that factions formed behind prominent men, such as Afonso I's son, Pedro Nkanga a Mvemba and Diogo Nkumbi a Mpudi, his grandson who ultimately overthrew Pedro in 1545. Although the factions placed themselves in the idiom of kinship (using the Portuguese term geração or lineage, probably kanda in Kikongo) they were not formed strictly along heredity lines since close kin were often in separate factions. The players included nobles holding appointive titles to provincial governorships, members of the royal council and also officials in the now well developed Church hierarchy.""

From 1622 to 1670, Congo, still a kingdom that had changed dynasties numerous times in that last century, fought _seven_ wars, six of them against major European powers all trying to colonize them, and they just barely survived. These guys are basically the Poland of Africa. By the end of the Congo Civil War (1665 - 1709, a 44 year period), Congo's capital had been leveled and its population disheveled. 

Congo miraculously continued to exist well into the 19th century as an independent state. Portugal had abolished the slave trade in 1838, although illegal slave trade became almost as prevalent as legal slave trade once it was abolished. However, it still helped the Congolese quite a bit. 

A difficult series of dynastic troubles led Portugal to established nominal authority over the Congo until the Berlin Conference.

&gt; &amp;quot;The disintegration of the European Union will not lead to the restoration of some mythical, full sovereignty of its member states, but to their real and factual dependence on the great superpowers: the United States, Russia and China,&amp;quot; Tusk wrote to the E.U. leaders.

&gt; European diplomats said senior national officials and diplomats discussed a possible E.U. response to Trump at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.

They aquire this utensil from members of the human race originating from the Caucaus Mountains in Southern Eurasia whose attribute of a lack of melanin within the skin cells they possess mildly resembles the lack of colour in an object known as 'the colour white' in their native tongue when compared to other groups of their race with a higher melanin content. They do this in an attempt to dismantle the lack of bacteria aquired within the Caucasian via the use of this untensil in conjunction with an anti-bacterial substance known in the western european language they use to communicate as ""toothpaste"". They dismantle this balance to bring on the effects the bacteria cause within their mouth cavity where the teeth of the individual decay due to bacteria using sugars absorbed into them as a source of sustenance that fuels its own cellular functions. This state can then cause immense pain, a state known as 'infection' where connected tissue is killed and helps spread the bacteria into other parts of the body and eventually a sickness known as 'Sepsis' within the sufferer's body that leads to a halt in bodily funtions usually through issues with the heart and other vital organs that eventually fail to perform these actions, inducing a state of death of this individual. This action proves useful to the agenda of the communists by solving a deep issue within the socio-economic ramifications of allowing the Caucasian group to hold power over the remaining groups, allowing the communists to seize the power snd distribute it among the revolutionaries and remaining sympathetic members of the laboring class known as the 'proletariat['.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/coaxedintoasnafu)

The only reason the authorities pretended to do something about that case, is because a journalist broke it. But they are back to business as usual. And yes, the same coverups are happening already in America. 

This isn't some one off thing. This is a repeated cycle of western governments putting a narrative above people. The cultural left has taken over the majority of the west, and in their view, it is better to let little white girls get raped and tortured than to risk ""increasing racism"" against the people doing the raping and torturing. A British man will get a year in prison for putting bacon near a mosque, while a gang of Muslim girls will get probation for beating a British girl unconscious. A Swedish artist will get jailed for posters ""mocking Islam,"" while a Somali migrant will get 6 months probation for brutally raping a 12 year old Swedish girl. This is also the reason the immediate response after ever terror attack is to worry more about hypothetical ""anti-Muslim"" backlash than the bodies on the floor. Fuck your idiotic narrative of the ""oppressed classes."" The western media gives more attention to fake ""hijab grabbing"" hate crimes than to gang rape against westerners. Last I checked, second class citizens are targeted by the media and the legal system, not given preferential treatment. 

The patience with which the west has endured these people is mind boggling. No other culture on earth would behave this way. Mainly because it is suicidal to do so. I only hope they wake up in time. The right is rising all over Europe, and that is a good start. Because the left has long ago made it clear that the only second class citizens in their minds, are their own people.

We are going to see a large increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the west over the next few years.  Some will be motivated by far-right populist leaders.  Other will be from reactionaries, afraid of the terrorism that's followed immigrants into Europe, who view their governments as incompetent when it comes time to address it (heck, when Germany decided to hide the Berlin attacker's identity out of fear that it would result in hate speech on Twitter, one has to wonder about governmental priorities).

It's worth noting that terrorism in the Middle East is the result of both politics AND religion.

&gt; Parkway Drive is an Australian melodic metalcore band.

&gt; The band formed in the summer of 2003, their name coming from the street they used to practice on in their home town of Byron Bay, Australia. Not long after they had formed, they released a split EP with Adelaide band I Killed The Prom Queen. Later that year, the band also made an appearance on the Byron Bay Hardcore compilation What We've Built, preceded by their debut EP, Don't Close Your Eyes.

&gt; In May 2005 the PwD headed to the USA to record their debut album with renowned metal producer, Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz (who is responsible for acclaimed releases from the likes of Unearth, August Burns Red, Underoath and Johnny Truant.)

&gt; Since the release of Don't Close Your Eyes, Parkway Drive have rapidly accumulated a loyal fanbase Australia-wide, courtesy of support slots for international acts including Hatebreed, In Flames, Chimaira, Shadows Fall, As I Lay Dying, Bleeding Through, Alexisonfire, and performances at Metal for The Brain 2005 and Australia's Hardcore 2005. They have built quite a strong reputation within the music industry, this led to their signing with Epitaph record label.
In June 2006 they released Killing With a Smile in the United States during August of that year.

&gt; In late May 2006, second bass player Shaun Cash left the band for personal reasons with the full support of the rest of the members. The band soon found a replacement in their ""merch guy"" and long-time friend, Jia ""Pie"" O'Connor. Now a permanent part of the line-up, he played with them for the rest of their first international tour in the United Kingdom, and Europe, and later dates in the United States.

&gt; In October 2006, they were billed as the Australian contingent on the Rockstar Taste of Chaos tour, playing alongside Anti-Flag, Underoath, Thursday, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday and Saosin. During November and December 2006, they appeared at the Homebake Festival, Sound Fest, Resist Records' tour, Soundwave Festival and Gravity G Festival before returning to the UK and Europe.

&gt; On 3 March 2007, a new song was previewed to a crowd at Underworld entitled ""The Siren's Song"". The song would later feature on Horizons. They were placed on the bill for the U.S. Vans Warped Tour 2007 as the only Australian band on the tour. On 15 August, Winston McCall appeared in an interview on the short.fast.loud show on Australia's Triple J Radio station in which he previewed a track off Horizons entitled ""Boneyards"".

&gt; Horizons was released on 6 October 2007. The album was generally acclaimed by critics and fans alike; especially Blunt Magazine, who wrote that the album 'simply slays from the get go' and awarded it 10/10, and planet-loud.com, which suggested that it would 'set the benchmark for metal albums to come'. It debuted at number 6 on the ARIA Charts. After the release of Horizons, the band toured through the US, Australia and Europe with such bands such as Killswitch Engage, Bury Your Dead, Darkest Hour and others.

&gt; In February/March 2008, Parkway teamed up with Byron Bay bands/friends 50 lions and Word Up!, to complete the Surf Rats Tour of east coast Australia. This tour (travelling to towns not listed on the standard touring circuit) was based around surfing big surf spots on the way.

&gt; On 12 December 2008 while performing at UNSW Roundhouse, Parkway Drive announced that they were filming a DVD of the show, which would include footage of the performance and a few songs from other bands featured in the Sweat Fest Tour. On 18 January 2009, Parkway Drive announced their headlining US tour with Stick to Your Guns and Mychildren Mybride. On 28 January to 1 February 2009, Parkway Drive went on a tour in Japan with Shai Hulud and Crystal Lake. Parkway Drive played at the 2009 Bamboozle Lineup at the Giant's Stadium parking lots; as well as being confirmed at 2009's Download Festival.

&gt; In May 2009, Parkway Drive announced that they would be releasing a live DVD and an Australian tour was also announced with August Burns Red and Architects in support of it. It was on this tour that the band performed a new song entitled ""Unrest.""

At this point in the US race, Trump was also in second place. She may win, although I'd put her odds below 50%. Francois Fillon (in first place) is having a rough week. If he has more, or if there is a terrorist attack in France in the next two months, Marine could pull of a win. If so, she plans to remove France from the euro and hold a referendum on EU membership. The rest of the EU will be terrified and angry and punish France by refusing to vote for Paris's bid. Muslim and African countries won't be any warmer.

LA is obviously currently under the thumb of Trump, but when viewed alongside the other two he is more of the same. It is unfortunate that he is given a rather large platform and will get the most attention.

All the national governments of bidding cities are (or soon could be) flaming piles of isolationist trash. If the IOC is looking for a city that has a strong commitment to openness they will have to look at city, local, and state governments. If anything, LA is a safer choice because Paris and Budapest are national capitals. LA is 2000 miles from Trump and has 3 layers of government (city, county, and state) that are vehemently opposed to Trump and his agenda.

If it comes down to globalism, we could end up winning by default.

If they were considered sovereign worldwide there would be no dispute.

Should Russia have allowed Ukraine to approve it, of course, but many Russians and Crimean civilians consider the area as Russian.

Of course the west is petrified of a slow moving and a more authoritarian version of its previous democractic Russian self, and might have flashbacks to the cold war, the truth is they are barely struggling to retain an energy monopoly over the region. Oil is cheap, OPEC can't maintain a cartel when several of their countries are struggling as it is, and even if they raised prices eventually US fracking would cut out their profits.

If Obama really was concerned about a Crimea situation he sure sat on it for almost 3 whole years. Which he actually rushed ahead of schedule after he found out Trump was elected, to make sure it was done before he left.

Which ignoring our ""trade"" obligations to NATO countries, poland itself spends a very modest of less than 2% of its gdp on its defenses. The US spends 5% of which it easily outranks the next country in spending by several hundreds of billions, for a country whose only direct borders are mexico and canada. Only realistic threat is nuclear, yet decides to fund other countries defenses. It is okay to ally and assist our allies but having dozens or hundreds of bases in foreign countries when that money could be spent either here for education, infrastructure, job training or even programs that help countries with a large poverty rate to help further insure that its civilians lead productive lives would be exponentially better for everyone.

Poland itself if it were really concerned could work closer with allies closer to home and allies who have nuclear weapons such as France and the U.K. it's not as if the US needs to depend to be in the center of every event and even with Iraq and Afghanistan many european countries were fiercely against the actions taken place yet did not call for the US actually reduce its influence substantially.

Of course Poland itself is happy, but many in Germany hate the US soldiers that take base there, and many other countries feel similarly but perhaps for different reasons.

While Obama allowed more of a proxy war to take place and never officially had soldiers go in, using a spec ops approach. His record on drastically increasing drone bombing crom the Bush era and the practice of assuming all targets in its range are enemies in nature has proven to be harmful to the communities and countries where it operates. To pretend that one bombing that happened on a hospital building striking doctors without borders was a stand alone occurrence would be remarkable ignorant. Even assuming you haven't read or heard of leaked documents, the chances that the intel and means of targeting are accurate more than a coin flip is hard to believe and the program itself is entirely unethical, it is a total war approach just barely better than night bombing that occured during WW2.

But yeah we are totally letting Russia prance right into europe, with so many allies there, bases there, nukes pointed towards them, planes and submarines and boats doing counter ""practice drills"" designed to measure each others defenses. You sound as if we are on brink of war when no clear proof exists or has been made available to the public, its just a show of force.

Its not like Russians are war hungry or want to take over the world, they do have self interests just as the US does, most of the time the differences we have is just in perception, sometimes that's fed into by their propaganda or ours.

This, I ceased to be long ago. How long, I cannot say, for in my existence time has no meaning. It is a concept of Them, Them who I resemble superficially but share nothing with.

I am the first and the last born of Adam; the first to murder and the first to grieve. I have read the stories written of me, how I was marked by the LORD. Those who know me, have known me, have suspected nothing. Perhaps they are unfamiliar with the story. Perhaps they do not realize that not all marks are outward.

Eternity. That is my Mark. To exist, without end, without respite, until the LORD calls me home. If He ever intends to. I have spoken to Him, but He does not answer. Perhaps He intended me, once, to gain a fuller appreciation of the value of life, of His greatest creation, the progeny of my father all. I do not, cannot, know, for His ways are mysterious even to those who have spoken to Him directly.

I can only say that if this were His goal, He has failed in me.

Eternity has not strengthened in me any love for the creations of God. Rather it has inspired in me a sense of fatalism, nihilism even - for I have been witness to a thousand, thousand tragedies and as many triumphs. For each conquering hero are the lamentations of the conquered. For every precious child born is one cut down in its prime. I have borne witness to all these things. 

I was present at Golgotha when Jesus, called the Christ, was crucified; whether he was the Son of Man, I know not, but upon that day his Creator deserted him as He has deserted me.

I was there in Europe, in its darkest hours, as the Chosen People of the LORD were herded like so many cattle to slaughter in ways my mind can scarce comprehend. He was not present then either; by now, this scarce surprised me.

I have seen the horrors visited by Man upon Man, through centuries and millennia. I have seen them celebrated, honored, ignored, and very rarely, resisted. In my age, all these things blend together; war into war, genocide into genocide, supreme ruler into fleeting tyrant of one small corner of a vast and unfeeling world. I am numb to them, for experience shows that this is the way of Man. 

Perhaps this is what He wants. To wander the earth for all time, privy to all the sins of Man, the sin which I first set into motion in childish jealousy all those years ago. To feel the powerlessness my brother must have, when I set upon him. Perhaps, even, to repent of the sin. 

But I cannot, for existence - not life, no, but existence - has rendered me numb to these things. And so, I am condemned to exist, outside the grace or even the attention of God, with no hope of death to relieve me. To bear witness to all which my sin hath wrought, for all time. To do so with numbness, apathy, knowing the futility of it all.

To be of Humanity, but never again part of it. This is my Mark. ",0,7,t3_5rdcz8,WritingPrompts,ahp327,,0,t3_5rdcz8,,1485932364,

What am I expecting? I am expecting the so called ""civilized"" world not to meddle in Ukraine. You can send back Nuland, McCain, Biden back to where they came from instead of agitating people on Maidan. I also expect EU to take a more sane stance on economics instead of proposing ultimatums to Ukraine. Yanukovoch was offered a better deal with Russia, a MUCH better deal. EU insisted on ""choosing"" them or Russia instead. EU guarantors also signed an agreement on peaceful transition of power. in February '14, when the country could've been saved instead of getting chaotic. Not to mention that Obama and Putin spoke on the phone days earlier, with Obama assuring Russian leadership that everything will be fine and stay within legal framework instead of supporting psycho mob, or should I call them ""peaceful protesters"" with molotovs and guns. As peaceful as ""moderate rebels"" in Syria. So if these legal documents mean anything to the ""civilized"" world that portrays to be supreme and epitome of justice, liberty and democracy, then perhaps they should've honored it? 

Now after all this and attempted assassination on LEGAL president of Ukraine. Everybody has a nerve to claim that nobody else but Russia played a role in this mess? Really? Crimea and South Eastern parts just decided to protest these events for the fuck of it or were they all under the gun of Russian special ops? Get a grip on reality.

Yes, aside from control of Germany's military she and her government are still bound to certain economic and immigration constraints laid out by the EU, just as the U.S. states have certain areas of power but are still largely constrained by federal law.

&gt;The armed forces?

There actually have been recent calls for an EU military force after Russia's antagonistic actions in Ukraine and Trump's recent statements regarding NATO.

t5_2qhcv,1488463245,False,1485934051,,dd6joob,"There are a number of problems with your statement.

Firstly, you are assuming the rest of NATO won't just give Scotland the nod to join immediately. Given the alternative is a sucking great hole in the northern Atlantic monitoring and defence network I'm not too sure the rest of the European NATO members are willing to compromise their own security solely to indulge Englands petty spite.


Secondly you are assuming that England won't immediately be buried under a mountain of trade sanctions and other punitive expressions of disapprobation from civilised nations for invading a democratic state ten times smaller than it that left peacefully. This would do vastly more economic and reputational damage to England than anything you could possibly hope to gain. At best it would be a pyrrhic victory.

Thirdly, I'd observe that if your best argument for maintaining the Union is the threat of military force rather than anything positive or mutually beneficial ... then that's a *pretty bad sign for the Union*. 

Fourthly that your readiness to resort to force and evident contempt for your neighbours is no small part of why there is a Scottish independence movement in the first place.



And finally, more as a general observation: I used to wonder reading the history of the British Empire (particularly in Ireland but ofttimes times elsewhere too) why so many situations went to hell when they didn't need to. When even at the time anyone with even a vestigial sense of empathy could tell that ""partners"" were going to object to being marginalised, taken for granted or otherwise patronised or treated with contempt.

The European Union made it more attractive to trade than to war. It was a idea to ensure that tensions between European countries would never escalate out of control. The idea that united was better than divisive. It's now being threatened by Brexit.

International trade agreements had a similar purpose. Countries involved had a greater incentive to remain at peace due to economic benefits. This is now beginning to be threatened by the nationalistic ""we can do better on our own"" movement.

Multiculturalism breaks down barriers between countries, making it easier to relate to each other. This leads to understanding and tolerance. But it's being replaced by right wing nationalist rhetoric which breeds anger, hatred and mistrust.

""knights"" is a so broad thing. so, why dont we start with something basic: armor. now, beafore talking about this, i must say the ""middle ages"" lasted for 1000 years, and yes, is truth in those times technology advanced a lot slower, but in 1000 years there were lots of technological advances, wich changed the armor, weapons and war itself. im going to talk about the most basic concept of armor, and of the armor of a knight. the armor of a knight can be divided in 2/3 layers depending on the period. the 1st layer of armor was a gambeson or aketon. its a cut-resistant and paded jacket. gambesons were really important: to see soldiers only using a gambeson and a helmet in the battlefield was a common sight untill the renainssance when fire weapons made them useless. the 2nd layer of armor was the mail armor (aka: chainmail). today we have 3 kinds of chainmail: butted, riveted and wielded, but in the medieval ages only butted and riveted existed. butted mail refers to a kind of chainmail where the end of each ring only ""meet"" each other without any reinforcement. this kind of mail could be easly penetrated by any kind of weapon, and was not common to see in the battlefield. the riveted mail, as the name indicates, had all the ring's ends riveted, making it REALLY strong. the mail armor was resistant against cuts and thrusts, and even if a weapon could pierce one, it still had to go through the gambeson (wich was not thrust resistant, but separated the knight's body from the mail) and lots of time the chainmail itself would ""trap"" the piercing weapon, disarming its user. thanks to the mail, in the europe battlefields you would see specialized weapons to deal with armor. they would try to do a blunt hit to the knight, strong enough to hurt the joints badly, dislocating the joints, or causing heavy trauma to the body or head. fighting someone dressed with gambeson and mail armor was not easy, and during long periods of time, this plus a helmet was all the armor a knight used (for example, this was all the armor the knights templar used). the size of the gambeson and the mail armor would change during the ages, and for the 13th century, the chainmail would cover the whole body of a knight, minus the face, wich was protected by the helmet. in the late medieval period, finally plate armor started to show up, and thats the 3rd and final layer in a knight's armor: plate armor. plate armor was made of a lot of diferente pieces, to protect EVERYTHING, even the joins are dificult to reach in a full plate armor knight. diferent protections will protect the joints of the armor, and in some places layers of plate armor would overlap for extra protection.

I fully agree and have been saying this. If the US doesn't try and get competitive now under Trump, China and Europe will lead the way and it's not easy to catch up to manufacturing bases that are established. Even worse, if the engineering springs up in the EU and China but not the US to a similar degree the US will be working from behind on *all* aspects and that hurts even more. Now consider the EU is teaching it's engineers about renewables and integration in core classes and the US has it only as token extra courses. Really though, what does the US think is going to happen when countries start taxing CO2 emissions on products, the US uses 2x more CO2 per person than Germany does and about 9x as much as China.

The EU is the *European Union*.  It's on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. Donald Trump is **not** the President of the EU.

Donald Trump is making very poor choices for the USA.  He's not allowed to make any choices for the EU.

Now we've finished that lesson, let's move on to English!  Do you know what a *homophone* is?

A homophone is a word that *sounds* the same as another, different word.  The words might sound the same, but they have different meanings.  Often, they are spelled differently, too.

Can you think of any homophones?  That's right; *some* and *sum* are homophones.  They sound the same, but they are spelled differently, and have different meanings.  

'Some' means ['an unspecified number or amount'](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/some).

'Sum' has [different meanings](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sum), depending on how it's used in a sentence.  The verb 'to sum up' means 'to give a brief summary.'

Pop quiz!  Which of these homophones correctly fills in the blank:

&gt;Did you just **___** up the EU?

If you answered *sum*, that's right!  Good for you!

If you answered *some*, you might need a little more practice with homophones. Don't be afraid to ask a teacher for help!

Even with 0.5% of potential terrorists from that pool leaves us with 5million people and these people are quite dispersed, so you can't just kill them all. Even though we would have 5mil potential islamic terrorist most of them wouldn't even look to the west for their attacks. Most of these attacks of terrorism happen in the middle-East, not in the West. Again I'm not trying to play down the senseless violence, but STATISTICALLY speaking your risk of dying from a terrorist attack in Europe is still after all this bullshit is still smaller than if you simply walked outside in a slippery weather. It's not the monster that media plays it out to be, it's fucking horrible that it happens at all, but if you want to stop it you need to stop treating these people as cattle

Can you not see that they are the same speices as you, they are in the end just people? They want the same basic things as you and you don't have a right to take that from them just because they believe in things instilled on them on their childhood. If we want this violence to end in the LONG TERM, we need to work with the muslim population in a way that encourages internal reform. That is the only way we can change these people, we need to change their whole ideology to fit this century. We don't need to pamper these people, or protect their faith in the manner that most of the liberal media is making seems to want us to, but we can't just dismiss their humanity, if we want lasting change. We need to take a non-violence line that is not this easily crossed. And yes targeting a group of people and detaining them just on basis out of these peoples controll (place of birth and the religion grown into) is a form of violence towards these people and it is as of now just serving to create more frustrated people. We can't afford to think this short sightedly in these scenarios and try to snuff this global crisis like it is an internal insurgency cell that you can just wait out to die. It won't happen this time.

Do you even know how many active terrorist cells are in middle-East and Northern-Africa? ISIS is not the only one and frankly might not even be the largest threat to the West. When you kill one two more pop up, just out of the resentment towards the West that have brought more war and turmoil to their lands. Try to be in thses desperate people's shoes for a second, because that's what they are, desperate fucking PEOPLE still even if they do horrible shit. People don't do shit for no reason what so ever and most of these islamic terrorist do have valid motives to be angry, even if they take that anger out in the most non-sensical way and end up killing others. We need to attack these reasons, not the people to make lasting change. Literally the only other way to end terrorism long term, would be a global muslim Holocaust, which is not an option obviously. I continue to stand by that we need to stop thinking in terms of us vs them. There is no real reason to contiune on singling out groups of people in hopes that by dismissing all of them, some of them would stop mistreating us. Hate tends to garner more hate and fear can blind you from others humanity, but in the end every single human in this planet is just human. 

Mr. Trump isn't any more or less valuabe as a human being as those that he is now singling out. And the issue of this muslim-ban, goes much deeper than causing a somewaht smallish amount of people short term anguish. It sets a scary precedence of willingness to single out groups of people not in the favor of the powers in be. If we let that happen and follow the leaders view of the laid out us vs them setting, where the government can choose willy nilly what group will be categorised as them and who belong in us, you end up with population that was willing to send a specific group of people into concentration camps and senslessly killing them for reasons out of their reach. As you have said, we can learn from history and the only reason I'm afraid of us slipping down that path is that some familiar warning early warnign sings of popular opinion shifting towards a situation where a certain group of PEOPLE is being viewed as sub-humans and that is when you start to run into problems. This is my core issue. Demonising groups of people will not accomplish anything more than more violence and in the end both sides will end up hating each other more. We need to grow the fuck up as a species and fucking work together, not against eachother, because if we ever want to survive and go into the stars and make even our wildest dreams come true, we need to stop fucking wasting our resources just to kill eachother. Logn term this can only be reached if we stop thinking in terms of us vs them. There is no outgroups, everyone is just a human being in the end and deserves to be treated as such. There is no need to hate another human, at least not for factors out of their own reach.

Okay so from first glance your idea sounds pretty nice, original and fun. I've had a long time interest for other countries around the world so as a kid I would have loved a gift like this myself. Certainly wouldn't describe it as lazy. However, there are some negative sides to this idea:  
* You are asking strangers on the internet to give their location (and probably their picture)  
* We don't know anything about you: your age, location, what you look like

It's not just that though. The thing is, this subreddit has recently received a few threads from guys asking to do almost the same thing for their girlfriend, as a valentines day gift. I've also seen threads like that on /r/Europe and some other place.  
This could mean 2 things:  
* There is a new trend going on (which would just be annoying and should be stopped)  
* People are collecting personal information with ill intent (impersonation, defamation, etc)  

Now, I'm a pretty chilled person and I don't automatically assume the worst of people. I'm going to say you meant well and that you just see this as what it sounds like, a fun idea.

The 'we didn't vote to leave the single market' idea that is floating around is an exercise in rewriting history in regards to what actually happened. The fact that a vote to leave would mean leaving the single market (a 'hard brexit') was probably the central point of argument between the campaigns. David Cameron and George Osborne (the two most powerful men in the country) [both confirmed it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn2hSVfqtYc) in the runup to the vote. [So did head honcho behind he Leave campaign Michael Gove](https://www.ft.com/content/0c5c74bc-151e-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e). Am I the only one who hasn't developed this amnesia? There couldn't have been anyone in the country who thought that voting leave didn't mean at the very least a possible, if not probable, exit from the single market.

&gt;So why, pray tell, would it be in any way inappropriate to hold a referendum on the ACTUAL terms of Leave vs Remain. It is, in fact, the only sensible thing, as it would be having an ACTUAL referendum on two specific options. 

Because it would be pointless. For starters, you'd have to narrow things down to two options, when there are a vast number of ways of doing it, and secondly it would be irrelevant because it's not a unilateral decision on the terms of leaving, but rather a negotiation between the two parties (UK and EU).

This law was passed specifically to prevent a monopoly. If an established power supply company owns all the cables, then it's impossible for another power supply company to have any chance in the energy market. Starting up their company would require them to build their own national grid network.

&gt; What you need to understand is that regulation makes it MORE DIFFICULT for new companies to enter an industry, literally by definition. 

Although there are plenty of cases where you are right, this is not inherent to regulations. There are two types of regulations:

* Those that hold everyone to a certain standard (e.g. FDA)
* Those that prevent the market from turning into a monopoly or easily exploited system.

I agree with you that most of the former make things harder for start up companies. However, we can then argue that the good (universal standard for food quality) outweighs the bad (mandatory certification to prove that you achieve the needed level of food quality).  
Food is an easy example of a product where we want to certify its quality. These types of regulations might be less accepted e.g. for an energy label or a fire safety certification; but they all have the same goal: to prevent the market from lowering product quality to a level where it becomes dangerous to the unknowing customer.

Top officials, including European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, have said that all the attackers were EU citizens: Most of the attackers were actually born in either Belgium or France — including the ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was born in a suburb of Brussels.

Earlier this month, though, Hungarian security officials did tell a British newspaper that the majority of the attackers posed as refugees in order to return from Syria after training in the country.""

By ""you"" i meant that from their point of view, the ""west"" wants to end their culture. I'm not from the west, so i guess i can see the confusion. 

&gt;i'm a classical centrist social liberal.

Sorry, but i find that utterly horrifying. You're a human being. Not a very specific category. It's scary because the more specific you are, the more black and white everything *seems* IMO. By nature, i hate boxes. I'm not an author, though i've written books, i'm not a musician, though i've done the rounds, i'm not a teacher, though that's my current job. And politically, i'm left and right and divisive and all over the place. lol.

&gt;my world view is the result of taking in media from every side

Dude... the media is a *terrible* thing to base your opinion on. It's 99% noise and 99.9 % propaganda (HYPERBOLE). Academia and experience are the best. It's FAR FAR more complex than anything you can read in an opinion piece. And tragically, far more simple as well, i think. 

&gt;do you think that nazi propaganda didn't represent the world view of the nazis? do you think that american or russian propaganda doesn't reflect THEIR world view?


you're confusing cause and effect. Propaganda, *by definition*, is the lie sold to people. Some - and usually they are far more active and visible - believe the lie. Doesn't make it truth. Most people *don't* believe the lie. Most people in the middle east don't ""want to see the western way of life destroyed"". 

I mean since you claim you're well read, with regards to the media, why's your view so disconnected from subs where there is actually factual and deep information about the war, e.g. \r\syriancivilwar. People from every ""side"" there seem to have at least grasped the hyper-complexity of it all and and don't try to look for simple justifications/causes. 

&gt;what is the motivation of the jihadists if its not what they have said? how do you explain their suicide bombings if they don't believe what they are saying?


You're confusing the guy on the ground with the guy who makes policy and conducts war. HUGE difference. Propaganda is not truth. **Not everyone hittles*. Meaning nazi level of national indoctrination is rare, and even with germany, it really wasn't so simple. If you actually studied hitler's rise to power *there's no way you could make a statement like that*. Anti-semitism, authoritarianism, etc. etc. were all VERY rife in germany, even before hitler got into politics. 

&gt;you think that having your land bombed turns you into suicide bombers? 

OMG, did you not read a word of what i said earlier?!

&gt;then how do those suicide bombers not pop up in places like russia?

Okay this is quite posibly the dumbest thing i've read today. I'm guessing that from where you're sitting, ""russia"" and ""the west"" are different things. More you *clearly* haven't read the news have you? Russia is and has been a *prime* target for Muslim extremism. So much for being well read!

&gt;there are tonnes of destabilized regions that don't produce suicide bombers. when was the last time you heard of suicide bombers in the congo ? when was the last time tibet sent suicide bombers against china?

WTF? OKAY SHOW ME YOUR PROOF FOR THE THESIS THAT EVERY DESTABILISED REGION WILL PRODUCE SUICIDE BOMBERS, OR THAT SUICIDE BOMBINGS ARE ONLY DONE BY PEOPLE WHO ""HATE FREEDOM"". 

WTF is logic? Just a bunch of ill informed phrases you string together into a sentence? WTF?!

In any case, here's a close example http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33166220. I even provided what you asked for (nerely) even though it's such a fucking ridiculous question! 

&gt;when was the last time tibet sent suicide bombers against china?

I would expect him to die in the attempt, you specify he lives thirty years more so I must make the following conclusion. He does not fail.

&gt; Japan has rejected Donald Trump&amp;#039;s claims that Tokyo was deliberately weakening the yen to gain an unfair trade advantage over the US. Trump told a meeting of pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday that Japan, along with China and Germany, were guilty of &amp;quot;Global freeloading&amp;quot; for using regulation and currency devaluation in their trade dealings with the US. The president&amp;#039;s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, also accused Germany of using a &amp;quot;Grossly undervalued&amp;quot; euro to gain an unfair advantage over the US and other EU countries.

&gt; The US currency briefly fell to 112.08 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday, but later recovered to around 113 yen as investors sensed a bargain.

&gt; The yen has weakened considerably in that time, from about 80 yen to the dollar to a low of about 125 yen in the middle of 2015.

&gt;WHAT CONSTITUTES A FULL-FACED VEIL??

The law is in relation to things which cover your face, in cases of ambiguity of that, courts decide the applicability.

If you want exact wording, I couldn't find the exact one for Austria, but it probably will be the same as for all the other bans in Europe. Here is the article 9a from the canton Tessin in Switzerland which has banned it:

*(1) Niemand darf sein Gesicht im öffentlichen Raum und an Orten verhüllen oder verbergen, die allgemein zugänglich sind (ausgenommen Sakralstätten) oder der Erbringung von Publikumsdienstleistungen dienen.*

*(2) Niemand darf eine Person zwingen, ihr Gesicht aufgrund ihres Geschlechts zu verhüllen.*

*(3) Das Gesetz regelt die Ausnahmen von Absatz 1 und bestimmt die Sanktionen.*

(1) basically states that ""No one may cloak or hide their face in a public place that is publicly accessible (with the exception of religious places) or during the execution of a public servant task.

(2) states that no one may force a person to cloak their face due to their gender.

(3) states that courts will decide on exceptions of (1).

So if you are a little kid running around with a ninja mask, no court will probably sanction you due to (1), so you have nothing to worry about.

I'm absolutely sure of that, it's clearly visible. Problem is their reaction when approached with some factual evidence like for example a video recording of some sort which is threatening their ideology, which is totally illogical and in most situations boils down to over-shouting a person as a ""racist"",""hater"",""nazi"" and all kind of ""phobe ending"" words, all given to them by their opinion creators like media and all sorts of people in power positions.

Please watch the [full video](https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4). **It can't possibly threaten the present time** considering it was recorded so long ago, can it? **it's from the different - cold war era** you don't have to be worried about bias whatsoever because Bezmenov is not talking about Trump or the right wing of today whatsoever, he simply talks about the mechanisms Soviet Union used to undermine societies in another countries.

It can vary somewhat based on classes you're supporting. Wizards you can more or less let do their own thing. You may want to give the wizard a demonstration in town first, of the healing range of epiphany / cyclone strike and tell them to keep it in mind. I've seen less experienced wizards teleport out of range and then complain when they die.

The staple witch doctor and gen monk are your best friend, you should hang around them as close as possible. If you have to choose one over the other, generally go for the WD as they're more likely to survive and they're who will wipe out the trash in the rift. The gen monk is more there to pop elites and of course the RG, so they become top priority then.

The most dangerous part is probably when you're on the move. If it's a narrow map or has doors like keep depths or corvus, try to cyclone monsters off to the side of corridors, or away from doors to keep the path clear for the WD and gen monk. The gen monk can dash relatively easily (though they'd rather not, to save spirit etc), but the WD only has his spirit walk to rely on and can easily get stuck. If the WD does get stuck, stick with him, put sanctuary under him and heal him while he firebats away the trash or refreshes his spirit walk. It's better than him dying.

When the group is moving, you sometimes should stick behind a second or so to provide healing to cover their escape, especially if there is still a lot of trash around, or elite affixes left over.

Also remember to look after yourself. Don't forget to periodically punch the air and cyclone to keep your damage reduction up. A horned charger will easily one-shot you otherwise. I've been one-shot in a GR90 before when I got distracted and dropped my defenses, pretty embarrassing :)

If you're in a lower GR and your DPS doesn't have that much trouble with healing you can drop healing cyclone for implosion and be more useful with grouping up etc. In higher GRs you are purely for healing. Try to keep your spirit up when danger is peaking (arcane laser coming through etc) so you can spam cyclone for massive burst healing. The gen monk is likely to die often simply because the build is so paper thin defense wise, but if you watch that clear carefully you can see I save him from death by the skin of his teeth multiple times with cyclone spam. It's easy to notice it during the RG (fucking orlash).

The katana and and wakizashi were more ceremonial weapons; status symbols (although at least the wakizashi was an appropriate length to be a weildy and good combat weapon). They were understandably relatively useless on the battlefield because of their short reach compared to someone with a polearm. In addition - since the swords by design primarily are *slashing* weapons - they are relatively useless against other samurai or other soldiers wearing proper armour. That is no different from how useless swords were against knights in plate armour in Europe, although the samurai armour tended to be less protective for the inside of the arms and legs - arms in particular. A further big penalty for the swords are that they are bloody useless from a horseback compared to a lance/long spear, and in particular when compared to the bow which stayed a primary weapon on the battlefield for the samurai.

Meanwhile the yari (spear) in particular came in a multitude of variants, often without a cutting edge and instead being pure thrust-weapons with variants of a triangle or diamond cross-section, i.e. being specifically designed to pierce armour. Further evidence for how central the yari was to combat is that they often had extremely long tangs (the metal bits going down along the shaft to join the metal head and shaft together), at least by European standards, making them extremely strong and near-impossible to break. It suggests the weapons weren't just sticks with a sharp steel tip on, but weapons that had gone through a long development to become refined center-pieces of warfare. They didn't see really common use until the Sengoku Jidai (the ~140 year period of civil war until the Tokugawa shogunate seized power in 1603, initiating the Edo period) however, where the extensive use of ashigaru (essentially militia) necessitated weapons that were simple to use, yet effective.

The naginata - once a common polearm on foot - was far less common than the yari in the later periods like the Sengoku Jidai  as warfare started including swathes of ashigaru instead of only samurai and other professional soldiers. Being more of a specialist weapon since it isn't quite as simple to use, especially in a cohesive unit since it requires some swinging-space to reach its full potential in variety of attacks. Samurai and warrior monks did keep using the weapon until the Edo period began, but even there it was gradually phased out as increasing numbers of firearms on the battlefield lowered the need for melee weapons. Some notable uses of the naginata stands out however, like how for example the Ikko-Ikki had a very widespread use of the weapon as late as the end of the 16th century.

In earlier periods the ōdachi (great sword) was used to some extent, and also during the Sengoku Jidai, but it was difficult and expensive to make such big swords - especially with the terrible iron quality in Japan - and as such they never saw really widespread use. Their unweildy size certainly didn't help them either. During the Edo period the swords were effectively banned (legal limitations to sword lengths) and fell out of use.

To summarize the use of the sword as a *combat weapon* is mostly in matters of honour (i.e. duels), and in other unarmoured combat such as banditry or police-work (the latter two included samurai too, with masterless samurai for a while rejected by society and roaming the countryside, and samurai to some extent being part of the police after their military duties weren't needed anymore during the Edo period).

t5_2qhqb,1488465789,False,False,West Yorkshire,dd6obdo,"I'll discuss this with you seriously. I think you make a very good point, although one that has been discussed a lot in all the EU countries, including us.

tl;dr globalisation exists. How are we going to respond?

1) To me, the key thing going on is globalisation. And yes, it has winners and losers. It means that 'banding together in a big Europe' is the solution that the governments of individual European countries have come up with to combat the rise of the Far Eastern economies and the global reach of the USA, and Russia- which of course was the USSR when the EEC came into being.

2) Within this configuration, both of global change and of the development of the EU, there is no doubt that those who are more cosmopolitan and more open to change, adaptation etc can benefit more easily and more quickly. I know that 'left-behinds' is a fashionable expression now, but I think it's kinda real.

One obvious example, but by no means the only one, us that at a grass-roots level, the left-behinds see much more motivated, and higher-qualified immigrants from poorer countries entering and benefiting from the economy of richer countries by doing the jobs and making the lives which the natives might not be as adapted to do.

The only countries I know intimately on the pro- and anti-EU positions here are Austria and Switzerland. It's very like here- the traditional people are against the EU and the more modern people are for it, because the traditional people see the threat to their existing ways of life, and the more modern people see opportunities and economic benefit.

3) Why did it go wrong? Well- the question is how wrong it has gone, or whether, overall, it's gone right for everyone except us. Or even, that is has gone right for us, but not enough people know that.

We had a less bad WW2 than anywhere that was invaded. Look back any number of years past that and we haven't been seriously invaded since, yeah, 1066. For the continent, fought over for so many centuries, 70 years of peace has itself been an amazing achievement.

Yes, the EU faces many challenges, and the ""left-behinds"" one exists in every country, I think, except maybe the Nordic ones. But maybe they think that overall, they are doing OK.

The 2008 recession did not help- as is equally true of us- one thing that makes change acceptable and even welcomed is that people's everyday lives are still benefiting. After 2008, everyone had harder times and was therefore more suspicious of change.

We have always been a bit semi-detached from the Continent. Is it as simple as being an island? As having a less 'Roman' law and bureaucracy and a more 'common law, common wealth' one? Maybe. At any rate, at some profound level we may have a different mindset from the Continental Europeans.

4) So, winners and losers? Well, here's another obvious tl;dr- speak more languages- more likely to be a winner in the EU- we're unlucky- most people's second language is English, so we are more crap at foreign languages- it's easier for them to 'take our jobs' than for us to ""take theirs"".

You also make the point about older people, and I will address that in the other bit of the sub-thread, because I think that is also a very good question, and one which I may be reasonably good at answering because I am older, and therefore I not only know older people, but I have even known people like my grand-dad who were born in the 19th century.

I'll just copy paste this from another comment that is wondering how. This is from ISIS's magazine Dabiq.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/12002726/The-grey-zone-How-Isis-wants-to-divide-the-world-into-Muslims-and-crusaders.html

&gt;Isil – which I will call Daesh – has articulated its own vision of an apocalyptic struggle between good and evil. It claims that “the world today is divided into two camps”: that of kufr, or unbelief, and that of their own warped interpretation of Islam. In between these lies the “grey zone”, inhabited by those who call themselves Muslims yet fail to join Daesh.
The grey zone, for Daesh, is a state of hypocrisy, existing not only in the West but in the Arab world. In the minds of its leaders, their declaration of a ""caliphate"" instantly imposed on all Muslims everywhere the obligation to join their cause. ""No Muslim has any excuse to be independent of this entity waging war on their behalf,"" says Dabiq. ""A stance of 'neutrality would doom him.""
And this is what the world needs to understand about Daesh. Its goal in the West is to destroy the grey zone, and make it simply impossible to be a Muslim in the West.

----
&gt;Daesh’s obsession with the “extinction"" of the grey zone lies in the value of this narrative to its recruitment purposes. If it can convince impressionable and disgruntled Muslims that they cannot possibly live as Muslims in Europe, and that Daesh somehow embody the actualisation of Islamic ideals in the form of a utopian “state”, then potential adepts may feel squeezed into choosing a camp, a choice which Daesh seeks to facilitate with promises of redemption and uber-machismo and by playing on real concerns over the religious freedom of European Muslims.
From this perspective, any state repression or racist backlash provoked by acts of terrorism is just an extra boon.
It’s telling that many of Daesh’s recruits appear to have identified with this concept of an inhabitable grey zone, many having come from troubled backgrounds, in difficult suburbs, with a history of petty crime and in some cases prison. Their “conversion” to a new life of “international jihadism” was a sudden departure from a previously directionless life, and a means of escaping a broader sense of malaise.",0,2,t1_dd69v3a,ukpolitics,alibix,,0,t3_5rcnp2,,1485950006,

Sure if evidence shows climate change is real I wouldn't say someone should stick to their conviction that it isn't, but when it comes to other issues that are largely philosophical or ideological (Capitalism vs Socialism for example) then sticking to principles *whilst absorbing new information and analysis* is a must.

&gt; FDR has about as much in common with fascism as a light bulb does with an orangutan. I just don't understand why people feel they have to replace what they consider to be one crazy idea with another, crazy idea.

European fascists loved FDR, though. They praised his actions and saw him as an American dictator. There's a good reason for that. 

&gt; There is something wrong, however, when your bias motivates you to misappropriate political terminology, particularly because FDR represents everything you find so distasteful about liberalism; and that he was good at it.

My issue is not liberalism. FDR went far far beyond liberalism. To borrow a modern phrase, what he did was not normal, and we should not normalize it. ",0,-2,t1_dd6i1ah,PoliticalDiscussion,everymananisland,,0,t3_5r9poq,,1485952077,

Robert Fossier, *The Axe and the Oath* (if you read French, the original is *Ces Gens du Moyen Age*) - Fossier is more evocative and literary in his writing, in the best traditions of French historians, but it does mean that occasionally lets his imagination take over a little.

PSD a castigat alegerea cu cea mai disproportionata victorie din istoria alegerilor parlamentare romane, tinand cont de asta, de ce nu ar avea voie parlamentul legitim ales de cetateni sa isi faca responsabilitatile? 

Traim intr-o tara cu democratie si separatia puterilor in stat prin constitutie. Amnesita colectiva si reformarea codului penal sunt printe responsabilitatile parlamentului. Astfel, cum putem sa spunem ca parlamentul nu are dreptul sa faca ce face (i.e reformarea codului penal si amnestie colectiva)?

Si daca am fi de acord o parte din cei care vor eliberati sunt hoti (sunt de acord cu asta), nu este riscul de a crea o dictatura mai mare? Pana la urma, separarea puterilor este esentiala pentru o democratie sanatoass)

Tinand cont de faptul ca curtea consititutionala a declarat ca fostul cod penal era neconstitutional, nu este normal sa fie schimbat astfel incat sa devina constitutional? 

Tinand cont ca Romania este pe cale sa isi ia o amenda de €80 milioane din cauza suprapopularii inchisorilor, nu e normal sa elibaram criminali non-violenti cu sentinte mici? Parlamentul nu are puterea sa aleaga doar unii prizonieri sau doar altii, aia e puterea presedintelui care a decis ca el prefera sa plateasca romanii amenda. Alternativele sunt sa elibaram criminali violenti, criminali cu sentinte mai mari, etc. Sincer, personal, mai degreaba l-as avea pe pistiulica care a vandut o iarba si vreo 10 PSD-isti cu crime minore, decat pe Ionita violatorul si vreo 300 de politicieni cu sentinte de 30 de ani penteu furt de milioane.

Sincer nu inteleg ca incearca lumea sa faca, intr-o democratie nu poti pur si simplu sa incepi sa plangi si sa urli pe strazi pentru ca nu a castigat echipa ta si sa ceri sa se repete alegerile. Daca nu vrem democratie, foarte bine, dar cei care au fost pe-aici inainte de 89, cred ca o sa fie de acord ca un rezultat democratic nefavorabil timp de cativa ani, e mai bun decat orice rezultat dintr-un regim totalitarian.

Protestatorii, daca reusesc sa primeasca ce cer, o sa  trebuiaaca sa achimbe fundamental constitutia tarii intr-un fel in care puterea ar fi mult mai centralizata in mainile executivului. Si daca a invatat lumea ceva din secolul 20 e ca puterea centralizata distruge. De asta sunt eu impotriva protestelor, nu pentru ca sunt un pensionar spalat pe creier, nu pentru ca am Antena 3 pe transfuzie in craniu, nu pentru ca imi place de politicienii corupti.

Hay un famoso experimento de Ariely que proponía a un grupo de médicos que estudiasen la idoneidad de una  cirugía, que en un principio aprobaban, luego se les decía, un momento, no nos hemos dado cuenta que nos hemos probado 1 medicamento. La mayoría optaba por retrasar la cirugía a la espera de la prueba, Pero si les decía, espera se nos ha olvidado, 2 medicamentos, la mayoría, optaba por mantener la cirugía sin probar ninguno de los dos.

También creo que fue un error el que cometimos al no confluir con IU el 20-D, se subestimó la capacidad de resistencia en ese sentido, y si se hubiera sorparsado al PSOE en aquellos momentos ... Pero agua pasada no mueve molino.

El problema es como encarar el futuro. Estoy de acuerdo que el espacio a ocupar es el que PSOE va dejando y más allá, también hay que pensar en los abstencionistas.
Pero para ganar a ese sector, en medio de una criisis generalizada de la Socialdemocracia en Europa, a la que Podemos ha contribuido en gran medida, pero sobre todo producto del giro de todos los partidos socialistas hacia el apuntalamiento del sistema, no tengo nada claro que la estrategia adecuada este en la moderación del discurso o la lucha institucional. El PSOE quiere vender esa moto, y la realidad hasta ahora es que está siendo utilísimo a los españoles, pero ¿A qué españoles? esencialmente a las élites, ni tan siquiera a los que les votaron con alguna mínima esperanza aún. Copiar aunque sea en las formas algo de ello, nos funde a Syriza le llevo a la victoria, luego podemos hablar de lo que hicieron con ella o no, la agudización de la crisis, pero sobre todo la firmeza, frente a un PASOK ""realista"" que salió como fuerza marginal de la gran coalición con Nueva Democracia.

I personally think that Solar+Storage+HVDC will be cheap enough to do it by the 2030 timeline. Europe is another story though...

&gt; BUCHAREST - Thousands protested in Romania&amp;#039;s capital Wednesday after the government adopted a last-minute executive order that undermines the country&amp;#039;s anti-corruption efforts.

&gt; Wednesday&amp;#039;s protest followed one that brought tens of thousands of Romanians across the country onto the streets Sunday in anticipation of the order.

&gt; According to Romania&amp;#039;s National Anti-corruption Directorate, the main institution here that deals with high-level corruption and which is seen as a standard-bearer for Eastern European countries which continue to grapple with the issue, the order will have a detrimental impact on its work, impacting hundreds of cases.

It's just phrased as one, just like your boss isn't really asking when she says ""don't you think you should come in on time?"".

The main reason why I think that Sam shouldn't leave islamism alone and deal only with Trump, is that the three problems are tightly related. The third being the ""liberal betrayal"" as Sam and Maajid framed it in their book (I prefer leftist betrayal, as there's plenty of liberal that's missing in those folks). The spread of islamism and the left's inability to tackle it in any sort of meaningful, or even honest way, is precisely what gave rise to Trump and other unsavory right wing characters in Europe. Just like Sam predicted it would many years ago and was smeared for issuing a prescient warning. Given that, I see these problems as a package and imo they need to be dealt with as such, not letting any of the hook. Obviously this means the issue is a tougher one than if it were a single problem, but it's not really any easier if you just close an eye and ignore part of it. At best it may only seem so. As for the name calling, what's left that wasn't already hurled at Sam? He's already been called a genocidal fascist maniac and not by mere random anonymous lunatics either.

Much better complaints about the UK are the rotten electoral system, reliance on private campaign funding, the executive's ability to bind the country to treaties unilaterally, and  the power of the party whips, as well as all the usual legalised corruption in the form of sinecures and so on after politicians who help the right people retire. 

If I could pass my own laws I'd ban private campaign funding, increase public funding and make it a fixed amount per candidate, and require each candidate's funds to be quarantined to campaigning in their own electorate. I'd also make HMSO publish and the post office distribute campaign materials, use BBC studios to record party political, and provide other services from public agencies to avoid the need for candidates to seek support elsewhere. That would break the main power the whips have, and I'd introduce AV which would further encourage the parties to fragment. 

More thorough reforms would be replacing the Lords with a house with actual power, which I would elect using an optional preferential STV system (using joint sittings and double dissolution on the Australian model for deadlock resolution but with an equal number of members in each house), allowing the recall by petition of MPs if 50% of their constituents wants them removed, and allowing public initiatives to trigger a referendum to overturn parliamentary votes on a simple majority (mainly to either veto a bill parliament likes or pass a bill it has rejected, but also for votes of confidence or anything else such as blocking SIs).

More difficulty, I'd want to strip the executive of the power to ratify and withdraw from treaties (including activating ratchets or standstills or subordinate measures under other treaties), giving minor ones (those which expire within 5 years, which can be reversed in effect by unilateral action equivalent to the default VCLT rules with no penalty other than the withdrawal of newly-granted benefits, which impose no new obligation (including raising the penalties for withdrawal), or which have no effective penalties for non-compliance) to parliament to pass as for ordinary laws and reserving the remainder (along with declaring war in the absence of a direct invasion of British territory) to a referendum supported by an absolute majority of the electorate. That reflects the practical effect of such treaties, which can bind a government as thoroughly as a restrictive constitution. (In practical examples, under such rules the ECHR and some of its protocols would have been rejected, at least at the time, Maastricht might have passed but narrowly, Lisbon would almost certainly have narrowly failed, and the addition of the newer eastern members of the EU would have been rejected soundly.)",0,1,t1_dd6phzu,europe,try_____another,,0,t3_5r85hr,,1485955235,

At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack it looked like Germany was going to steamroller right into Moscow. One of the more remarkable efforts of the Russians in WW2 was the dismantling of entire factories and relocation of them further to the east. That and Stalin basically pouring men into a human meatgrinder to hold the Germans back to stall for time.

So I'm Australian and the last referendum we had was to remove the Queen as our head of state and to replace the Governor General (the Queen's representative) with a President.

There are three major differences in how referendums are held in Australia. First you have to get a super majority to pass a change, voting is compulsory so 100% of the population voted in it and finally the referendum has to be for an explicit change to the constitution. So before the vote was even held the proposal had to explain exactly what the new system was, how the President would be appointed and what their role was. 

The majority of the population actually wanted to become a republic, but the vote was still lost because not everyone agreed with how the President would be appointed.

If it had been held the same way as it was here, then we would have voted to become a republic and then had years of arguments over the form and then resulted in a system the population is unhappy with. Pretty much what is happening here.

Whether you agree with the super-majority rule or not, this referendum really should have been for an explicit change. It should have been clear from the start that the vote would be to leave the EU, but remain in the EEA, or to leave both the EU and the EEA, or whatever other system is currently being argued.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ad25f09dbc7748c987b4ffd59365fda4.png)  

&gt; Damien Rice (born December 7, 1973) is an Irish singer-songwriter. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, to George and Maureen Rice and was raised in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. In March 1999 Damien moved to Tuscany, then travelled around Europe, busking the streets. He arrived back in Dublin a year later, with a clear head and full of ideas. Damien started playing and recording music with his first band, Juniper. After a few years he decided creatively it was not for him so he left the band (Newly named Bell X1) to start a solo career.

&gt; He approached his music with a new found freshness and decided to put some songs down on record. His grandmother told him he had a distant cousin in London in the music business.  Borrowing money from those that would lend it, he recorded his demo and sent it off to his cousin, renowned producer and film composer, David Arnold (Bjork, James Bond). Arnold liked what he heard and provided enough money for Damien to buy his own mobile studio.

&gt; Damien Rice formerly sang with Lisa Hannigan and released his debut solo album, O, in Ireland in early 2002. In July 2002 O was released in the UK and it received widespread critical acclaim. In June 2003 O was released in the USA and Europe, with Rice appearing on The Letterman Show and receiving more acclaim from publications such as Rolling Stone, Newsweek and The Boston Globe.  Arnold joined him on stage in New York to perform a version of the Björk/Arnold track Play Dead.
He gained further popularity after some of his most famous songs were included in the media. An example of this is 9 Crimes used in the soundtrack of the summer blockbuster Shrek Three and The Blower's Daughter was featured in the movie Closer. Delicate was also featured in the hit T.V. show Lost.

&gt; Damien Rice is an intense live act - with emphasis laid on emotional intensity and experiments, rather than technical perfection. At a 2005 concert, for instance, he threw out big cheeses to the audience. This can sometimes be more demanding for the listener than the radio hit edit of the song Cannonball suggests.  'Cannonball' was re-mixed in 2004, for UK radio, to make it more radio-friendly. Rice later was reported to be very unhappy with it, saying to Tom Dunne on PetSounds (Today FM) that he did not ""...really like it"". He stated that he had allowed the remix to go through only if he signed a contract that would forbid anyone from ever remixing one of his songs ever again.

&gt; Damien spent 2004 and 2005 recording the follow-up to O. The album, 9, was released in Ireland on November 3, 2006, on November 6 in the rest of Europe, and in North America on November 14, 2006. Even though the new album maintained Rice's sense of ""emotionality,"" some argued that it did so through volume and intensity rather than with the reflection and lyrical commentary that characterized his first release, O.

&gt; Rice has also developed a reputation as a live performer, selling out at venues across Europe and the United States. He is a performer who gives a lot of himself to the audience.

&gt; As of March 25th, 2007, this was posted on the Damien Rice official website: After much thought and discussion Damien has decided that his professional relationship with Lisa Hannigan has run its creative course. As a result Lisa will not be appearing at any of the upcoming live shows. Lisa is embarking on her own artistic endeavours and there are no plans for them to work together in the foreseeable future. The current band on tour at the moment are - Damien Rice, Joel Shearer, Shane Fitzsimons, Tom Osander, and Vyvienne Long.

&gt; Rumors that Damien Rice is currently dating Mélanie Laurent, a French actress, has not been verified.  However, there have been reports that he is working with the actress to record her debut album. Read more on Last.fm.

Foarte bine. Doar asa poate sa fie taxat PSD cu adevarat pentru ce a facut. Cu cat mai multi membrii se lepada de partid si atrag atentia asupra gestului absolut nemernic si impardonabil a celor din varful partidului, cu atat mai bine. Nici macar nu-mi pasa daca e un scenariu clasic de ""rats fleeing a sinking ship"" anticipand furtuna de cacat care o sa loveasca PSD-ul in urmatoarele zile. Singurul lucru care conteaza e sa fie cat mai multi oameni care denunta faptele lor, inclusiv oameni din randul lor. Doar asa pot sa fie consecinte reale pentru acest partid mafiot, ca daca protestam doar noi astia ""frumosi si liberi"", ii doare fix in penis, pentru ca stiu ca noi oricum nu o sa fim niciodata votantii lor. Trebuie ca toti romanii sa se ridice impotriva lor si cat mai multi din proprii suporteri.

Edit: Ca sa mai dezvolt ideea, eu sunt convins ca slugile loiale din varf cum sunt Iordache si Grindeanu nu o sa renunte si o sa mearga pana la capat pentru Dear Leader, dar pe de alta parte sunt la fel de sigur ca membrii din rangurile mai inferioare care nu primesc nicio recompensa pt. cacatul pe care l-a facut Dragnea ca sa-si salveze pielea, ci doar huiduieli si injurii de la sutele de mii de romani care o sa iasa in strada, nu sunt tocmai la fel de incantati de ideea de a fi loiali pana la capat. Ei sunt punctele slabe a partidului MAFIOT numit PSD, oameni care nu cred ca vor sa-si expuna gatul pentru javrele de la conducere si nu cred ca o sa stea alaturi de ei cand o tara intreaga isi baga pula in ei. Partidul asta trebuie dezmembrat incepand de jos, si asta se poaet doar daca sentimentul din interiorul partidului se intoarce impotriva lui Dragnea si a rahatului momumental pe care l-a facut.

Don't know if serious question or not, so I'm going to treat it like you're genuine.

F1 is almost certainly the most intense series that motorsport has to offer. Both from the physical condition that a driver has to be in (ie training time), from the season length (19-21 race weekends March-nearly December), to the travel (those race weekends are across 5 continents), and from the PR perspective as well (many media days).

There are plenty of drivers that have stepped down from F1 voluntarily but continued to race in series that are less demanding on their lives. Mark Webber went from that to WEC (9 race weekends April-November, 4 of which are in Europe 0-1 time zones from his home), David Coulthard retired from F1 and went to DTM (11 race weekends, 10 of which were European).

Formula E is a 10 race weekend series with 4 European and 1 Moroccan race within easy reach, but still contains some great drivers, so it fits into that level of racing that a newly-retired F1 driver *might* want to do to ease them into a semi-retirement.",0,1,t1_dd6mque,formula1,anneomoly,,0,t3_5rebv7,GerhardBerger,1485959889,

What i (and the rest of the csgo community) don't like is the close to oversaturation status that is being generated by the multiple leagues and events but i mean, while that's a problem cause it lowers the quality of competition, it also means that there's a lot of interest in creating events and providing huge prize pools so...

Soccer has had a huge influence on kicking in football. Before a hungarian immigrant/soccer player came along, kickers used to approach the ball from straight on. Approaching from the side used to be commonly referred as ""soccer style"". Soon after a flood of Europeans with soccer backgrounds fully revolutionized the way field goals were kicked in the NFL.",0,1,t1_dd6qus1,todayilearned,Cyorkshireman,,0,t3_5rde59,,1485960184,

The problem is that throughout most of my country's history (Romania) we were more often than not closer to danger. We've almost always been stuck between hostile powers - between the migratory tribes and the Roman empire, between the Habsburgs/Austro-Hungarian Empire / Tzarist Empire / Ottoman Empire, in WWII Nazis to the West, Stalin the the East (of course, that's true for a lot of other countries) and so on. If shit (e.g. Putin) hits the fan, we might be among the first to fall. Given the other problems in the Western Europe / rest of Europe / Middle East and maybe USA, we might be quite alone to fight this... shit (I mean Putin).

t5_2sfmf,1488469498,False,False,,dd6v35m,"You'll probably get a handful of different answers but there's a few common ideas that seem to crop up on this topic. For the record, I'm American so this is based on readings and discussion but not necessarily firsthand experience with the cultures and economics.

1: Joining the Eurozone/adopting the Euro

This is one of the more contentious answers, as people seem to be very split on whether or not adopting the Euro is a good or bad thing. Yet the problem with a single currency across an area as diverse as Europe is that each country in the EU is wildly different.

When a large country has most of the control over EU policy, they tend to use it; the austerity measures introduced in Greece are merely one example of it. Was it the best call? [Probably not](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/does-austerity-work-or-does-it-make-things-worse/) but Germany and the other, larger EU countries and organizations had to balance what their people wanted and what the banks wanted with trying to keep Greece from collapsing.

Spain's problem was instead a massive housing boom mixed with lower interest rates; effectively Spain was [doing okay while Germany wasn't](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/04/16/spains-shining-economic-recovery-or-how-the-eurozone-defines-success-down/#178632ff11c9). Since interest rates were set to German levels, it didn't keep up with Spain and helped prop up a massive economic speculation bubble. Housing market drops, bubble pops and now Spain is still struggling to get itself back to stability in some ways.

2: Immigration Tensions

Without touching upon the morality and hether it's politically correct or not, taking in thousands upon thousands of foreign economic migrants from wildly different cultures is not a stepping stone towards stability. While many did not stick around in Southern Europe, they still required resources and government intervention on *some* scale, drawing those resources away from other measures the government could use to work on its' own economy.

Many of these economic migrants from North Africa tended to go through Italy and Greece; both countries hit hard and still struggling after the recession and austerity, now have to deal with this new problem. Add to that Germany and the EU holding their feet to the fire on handling the influx certainly added stress to the already beleaguered government.

Now, you asked what can be done to help them improve?

Honestly, I don't know. Part of the issue with the EU is that it's such a weird amalgamation of ""separate but together""; how you would attempt to fix a Germany or Norwegian economic problem is very different from fixing the Greek problem, they were caused by wildly different issues.

Generally speaking, consensus seems to be that government spending in a recession is [a good thing](http://hubpages.com/education/Government-spending-and-taxes-during-recession). There's certainly some economic merit to either side and I am far from an economics expert, so I will leave that to smarter people than I.

So cutting austerity and increasing spending in these governments, provided that they're actually used to help the economy and not pay [some of the rather absurdly generous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2010/02/greeces_generous_pensions) social programs or going [straight to the banks](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/business/bailout-money-goes-to-greece-only-to-flow-out-again.html).

Long term, what does this probably mean?

I genuinely don't think the EU can survive in its' current form. The governments and economies of all the various countries and systems are too wildly varied to work; a German work-heavy system is being asked to support a Greek social-welfare-heavy system and people will resent that (merely one example to make the point). Central banking systems will tend to work with the largest countries to prop them up for economic returns but what may work for a heavily industrial country does *not* work for a country that emphasizes tourism and non-industrial labor.

t5_2qh13,1488469850,False,False,,dd6vqge,"&gt; I for sure don't think it's democratic, I never chose to be in the EU, I probably never will be able to leave it either since I live in a small EU country who loves Germans and we want to leech on their power by agreeing to anything they do.

That just sounds like you don't like it when democracy goes against you. I'm assuming you're Swedish based on your post history, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Your country democratically voted to join the EU, so even though you didn't choose to doesn't mean it wasn't democratic.

&gt; If I vote or not doesn't matter since no party is really focusing on leaving the EU.

This doesn't sound like a problem that the EU has created, but more like a lack of political will to leave the EU in your country. If leaving was a popular viewpoint surely there would rise a party to take advantage of that.

&gt; Then the EU agrees on new laws and policies that will apply to all their countries, who have different economies, different cultures, different people and different governments with different policies on their own. Which is a stupid fucking idea since every country is unique.

But every country also has a seat at the table and the ability to modify policies. A lot of the EU is built through compromise. It's also not inherently undemocratic to have laws that apply to everyone. That's how most countries work.

&gt; Then if by any chance we'd leave EU we have to pay A LOT of money and have to go through a huge process that will take focus away from many other important things and it will take years to fully adjust. Kind of like being a member of the church of Scientology, you have to pay money for literally anything they ask you to, and you can never leave without going through a lot of shit.

The EU is large and complicated. It's no surprise it will take a lot of time and effort to completely get out of it. You can definitely leave without going through a huge process, but that would be bad for both the leaving country and the EU. The reason Brexit for example is so complicated is because just saying ""we're out"" without implementing some form of replacement will have extremely negative consequences for everyone, not just Britain.

t5_2qh13,1488469889,False,1485970050,,dd6vszu,"Actually it isn't. The Council of The European Union and European Parliament are the two branches of EU legislature. The equivalents being for example the House of Representatives and Senate in the US Congress or the House of Lords and House of Commons in the UK Parliament. The European Comission is the executative branch, roughly equivalent to the UK Prime Minister and his/her cabinet or the US President. The European Council is what at best could be described as a joint head of state of the EU, equivalent to the UK Queen or King or the US President. 

The difference is that most parliamentary systems today use a separated Head of Government and Head of State. The US President serves as both Head of Government and Head of State. Otherwise the EU system is a basic bicameral parliamentary system, except with the ""Head of State"" being split among all Heads of State of the countries of the EU joined in the European Council. The""President of the Head of State"" is since 2009 voted every two and a half years by the Council, but his function is really only as a sort of moderator and diplomatic face of the EU, not really having any significant authority over the rest. 

So technically the wording is correct, most systems like this use the term President for the Head of State while the Prime Minister or Premier or some similar term is used for the Head of Government. 

Though I admit that the actual names used for these institutions couldn't have been more confusing. You have the Council of the European Union and you have the European Council led by Tusk. They could have somehow made this a bit less similar sounding.

Apart from that what stats do I need as a WL? - I need this info for all the builds (lets say that maybe dragoncall relies more on crit than helix builds? I don't know...)

And regarding accessories: What boss drops the ""Asura belt""? I could not find any info on this side...


**TL;DR**

1. What HM skills should I unlock for both PvE (priority) and PvP (already have Dragoncall)? - I'm thinking about HM-RMB
2. What are the **VIABLE** builds for WL? both PvP and PvE. All the info I have found on this topic is obsolete.

I know about ""ice"" and ""dark"" builds. Ice = dragoncall and Dark = Helix? And I've heard that Helix can also be paired with bombardament...I am currently HELIX+DV but I switch to Bomb from time to time. Fro the first doing 1&gt;F(Quell)&gt;V (opening - for V instant cast) afterwards fillers (prioritizing Helix and RMB and F whenever it procs) 2&gt;F&gt;V&gt; Fillers 3&gt;V&gt;Fillers and so on.

3. Any good WL to watch?(youtuber, streamer)
4. Asura belt drop? (preparing for the 8th feb patch)
5. Status priority? and if this Stat prio changes from build to build, what are the stat prio for each build
6. Legendary SS for WL - Do I need them all or I combine them with ebon or something?

Thanks a lot in advance, I've googled all of this info and I have a small idea what they are about, but everything is still unclear in my mind...whomever will answer my questions and shed some light into my head will defensively have all of my respects.",0,1,t3_5r2qek,bladeandsoul,ChezAether,,0,t3_5r2qek,,1485962483,

The Russian economy had already been devastated during the Great War, and much of the country already faced famine by 1917 (this being a large reason for the revolutions in the first place). And then, as you said, when the Civil War began in earnest towards 1918, the Reds had the problem of feeding the major urban centers in European Russia. 

The Bolsheviks resolved their problem by implementing ""War Communism"". It was essentially a set of emergency measures designed first and foremost to feed the Red Army and the cities by nationalizing production and agriculture. The state centralized all work  and and took over as sole producer and distributor. 

Because of the chaotic situation, private ownership was not totally wiped out, but the Bolsheviks did succeed largely in requisitioning enough food to feed their armies and the cities. In practice, this was done simply by confiscating whatever they needed from the countryside. It left thousands of peasants starving to death. Again, as you guessed, partisans were a major problem. In fact, several major uprisings occurred against Bolshevik requisitioning, most notably in Tambov where a rebel Blue Army some 40,000 strong fought against the Reds. 

On the topic of where the Reds got their arms and supplies, they had the luck of controlling the vast majority of Tsarist military supplies. The Whites had to scramble for foreign aid while the Bolsheviks could mostly rely on Great War stocks. 

**TL/DR** The Bolsheviks fed their cities and troops by shamelessly taking food from the countryside, and ruthlessly crushing any opposition to it.

Ever since him, they've wanted to follow that again - throughout the seventies and some portion of the 80's it was a horror show for them specifically (must take into account the Munich disaster which plays a huge role in this case).

No players for United in the 70's and early 80's period were even good enough until the likes of Robson and co. were appointed with Big Ron in charge. And by the time any of the great players United had were old enough to actually manage, they had hold of Fergie. The rest of that is history.

t5_2cneq,1488471188,False,False,,dd6xxub,"&gt; Take a look at the number of terror deaths in the US, or against Americans abroad, then compare that to the number of deaths from other avoidable causes like heart disease, lung cancer, gun violence, drug overdoses, suicide, alcoholism, car accidents, and so on.

I'll take a look at the deaths caused by lung cancer, and I'll know that most of our thinking minds in Medicine are searching daily for a cure. I'll loke to gun violence, drug overdose, alcoholism, and I'll know those are caused by someone's bad choice, a someone in need of help (in case of substance abuse) or limitation (in case of destructive behaviour). I'll look at suicides and heart disease and know we have treatments for those, and that I, too, can do my part in helping. But when I look at terrorism, and I look at the changes it is making to Europe and to all Western society, and I don't see action being taken to *prevent* it. Sure, we wage war in the aftermath, but what's being made to **protect** ourselves? Clearly not enough, or Trump wouldn't've been elected with that rhetoric.

&gt; Imagine for a moment that our nation cared as much about those deaths as they did about those caused by brown people and wanted to do something.

Terrorists aren't exclusively brown, mate. Look at the shooter on the Orlando club in 2016. 

&gt; Except, of course, if we reacted to those deaths in the same knee-jerk fashion as we do to terrorism; oh, thousands of people died in car accidents last year? Ban cars. People are still getting cirrhosis of the liver? Prohibition 2.0. Suicides among military vets keep climbing? Mandatory hospitalization for any service member who looks a bit gloomy. It's reactionary, stupid, and in cases like Prohibition it only causes other problems--just like this ban.

Someone dies in a car crash, caused by their alcoholism? We already make ""don't drink and drive"" campaigns for YEARS now. If someone dies because they're actively careless, there isn't much more we can do.

Someone dies from substance abuse, it's because they chose to engage in it. We have campaings and recovery centers and AA meetings all around. We are actively trying to help these people.

Someone suicides, and again, it's an active choice from someone. And we have lots of places to help people with depression. 

But, when someone is **murdered because of Religion**, when someone is **murdered because of their beliefs, their sexuality, their gender, their place of birth**, what do we do then? Do you want to know what we did the last time someone tried to pull that ""religious murder"" shit? We went to war with them so hard there were nuclear bombs involved. So don't tell me we're reacting in a ""knee-jerk"" way, and don't compare someone commiting a hate-fueled murder against their fellow man to the careless and self-destructive actions of others.

&gt; I've got nothing but sympathy for victims of terror attacks, but death tolls aren't the goal of terrorism--terror is, and it's on us if we start to fear and give ourselves a self-inflicted wound. All we have to fear, and all that.

We have nothing to fear but fear itself, yes. That is why we should face this enemy head-on, and take all measures we can to defend ourselves from it while fighting at our strongest to erradicate it. And the goal of terrorism is not *just* terror - one of the stated goals of various members of ISIS is to erradicate Israel and kill all Jews around the world. That's just their views - they don't see their fellow human as human. We can't negociate with that kind of people, we can't argue with them, we need to fight them and defend our own. And if defending our own comes at a price (it always does), we have to weigh our decisions so we can cause the least amount of damage to innocents we possibly can.

*  There are a lot of affordable IP cameras these days have about 35m of Night Vision range.  If you want to be able to positively identify a face from 35m, that may be a bit more difficult.  [A fixed 4mm lens camera](https://www.arcdyn.com/dart-1080p-fixed-lens-bullet-camera.html) can usually only ID a face from ~15m.  You could look into a [Varifocal Lens camera](https://www.arcdyn.com/arrow-1080p-varifocal-bullet-camera.html), but that would probably put you above your budget quickly.

*  Most IP cameras have Motion Detection recording as part of their basic analytics.  This means that you can tell your camera to record whenever it detects movement in the Field of View (you can also do 24/7 or even a schedule that alternates between Motion and Continuous.)

*  Most weatherproof cameras have Night Vision (IR).  If you are really concerned about having the very best Night Vision, check out some [EXIR Turret style cameras](https://www.arcdyn.com/slingshot-1080p-fixed-lens-turret-camera.html).

*  Both of the ones I've linked so far are rated to -30˚C - 60˚C.  

*  You are looking for IP and Power Over Ethernet.  This means you have to run a Cat5/Cat6 between your recording device and the camera, this carries the power to the camera and the video back to your recorder.

*  I would recommend getting an Network Video Recorder (NVR) for storing the footage.  For 2 cameras you would need a [4 Channel NVR](https://www.arcdyn.com/carbon-40-4-channel-network-video-recorder.html).  The model that I linked has a Built-In POE switch to power the cameras as well.  A 1TB drive would be plenty for 2 cameras.

*  We do have a complete [2 camera package](https://www.arcdyn.com/security-camera-systems/2-camera-hd-security-camera-systems.html) available, but it's a bit outside of the budget you mentioned.  You could get that system without a Hard Drive and buy your own WD Purple Surveillance Grade HDD for cheaper on Newegg or somewhere like that.

We Europeans are hypocrite, because while welcoming a bit more than a million refugees last year, we've gone back to pay dictators to keep them away (This time Erdogan instead Gaddafi) and let the rest drown in the Mediterranean. It's very simple for Canada and US to look humanistic, having thousands of miles of ocean between them and the next war zone, so they can cast a few thousand families a year and have a welcome party, while Europe basically can choose between killing them or taking too many so they can't be taken care of properly. 

The biggest mistake of the Obama administration was getting rid of Gaddafi and I am glad my government didn't support it. He was an asshole, no question, but half of north and central Africa could find jobs in Libya, while their only chance is now to make it to Europe.

I've been lucky to find great stuff in the bargain bins and have equipment that plays even semi-thrashed vinyl well. So, I stick to digital for new and vinyl for old.

A socialist wants to criticise Trump, a right wing president. Surprise, surprise. And the Brexit negotiator too, we know how much trust the British people have in them. Desperately trying to save their sinking Union and trying to sabotage our relationship with Trump. It's a bad omen when the man in charge of Brexit negotiations is telling us to condemn Trump because he hates the EU- criticism isn't something they seem to like. He may hate the EU but assuming he will actually try to implement its destruction is unreasonable, he's been in for 12 days.

I trust them no more than Trump and I'm very surprised you do. Britain voted to leave not just because of immigration but a feeling of parliamentary sovereignty and the members of the EU who are desperate to hold onto their influence being toxic and condescending of our nation. Let's not keep pretending that we need the European Union itself when a trade bloc is what we all want without the democratic element- people don't like the way the EU is run so voted to leave it. You are underestimating our power in the EU. If it is destroyed we can have a successful trading bloc without the democratic part many people dislike- don't pretend Europe cannot be successful without the EU. Without it there would be more freedom for countries to negotiate trade deals with us freely instead of being held up in the EU's negotiations and how some want to punish us for leaving. 

That's not good for our nation, and a lack of an EU won't be all bad. It's unpopular hence why we voted to leave it. He is the president of the United States, they are also a large trade partner and if the EU does come down I don't believe it will be because of Trump but because of their rapid power grab, naivety of the patriotism within countries and their left wing borderless mentality which many people don't like. The EU is falling and they are going to try to blame it on Trump now it seems. But the revolution will come from inside- Britain, Greece, the Netherlands and maybe even France if Marine Le Pen does well. 
We will be a group of friends without having to pay up to them when they want even when the Prime Minister voted to not pay. We don't want them to keep expanding their power over our Parliament. We don't want to have an EU army. We don't want the euro to destroy countries wealth like with Greece and then have them come running to other nations to give bailouts for austerity programs the Greeks do not want- but whose pleas they ignore. We shouldn't be looking inward to Europe alone but outwards to the world and make Brexit successful.

There's a lot of hate towards it because a baby has no ability to decide if it wants its genitals permanently altered and numbed, and as somebody who was circumcised only to stop being religious when they turned 12, I (and many others) wish to have had that choice. 

You mentioned being Christian, you might want to know that circumcision is actually denounced in the [Bible](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5r75a8/this_double_standard_infuriates_me/dd596jb/). It was never actually a Christian thing and in most of the world people don't get circumcised. The reason it is popular in America is because of a guy who said it would stop your son from masturbating if you partially numb the penis. James Harvey Kellogg was the guy, and he found out that [mutilating men and women's genitals stops excessive masturbation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention). Sewing the penis shut with wires through it? Yep. Circumcision is literally supposed to make the penis way less sensitive, and sex less enjoyable or even difficult. 

[This user even has a list of scientific journals and articles denouncing circumcision](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5r75a8/this_double_standard_infuriates_me/dd5ox0d/).

Now, why is circumcision so popular, even encouraged by *some* doctors? I don't know, because the times where it is a medical necessity are very few (1-2% or less), and as the links I've listed show, most doctors and studies outside of the U.S. are very against it. Recently in Europe (Denmark?) there was a group of 26,000 doctors that denounced circumcision. Some people think U.S. doctors might push for it because a doctor might do 3-4+ a week and when you are charging $80-100, that's thousands of dollars per year that add up. That's a trip to Europe for them and their family.

In any case, hopefully you understand our point of view better now. Most people here just want a baby to be protected until they are old enough to make the choice themselves. Even if you still decide to circumcise him, perhaps also consider waiting until he is older to choose for himself. My personal belief is that our own right to our body and our lives is very important, even more important than the parents' right to practice their religion, and unless it is medically necessary, we shouldn't change people's bodies permanently when they have no say in the matter. Far too many people are born, circumcised, become non-religious later in life, and now carry a permanent scar on their body that they might be quite furious at their parents for. There are quite a few people on here who hate their parents after they found out they were circumcised for no good reason.",0,2,t1_dd6vxo0,MensRights,Taco474,,0,t3_5r75a8,,1485965900,

Freedom from Turks is more valuable than a thousand square miles of land, especially when you consider it's location, far away from Greece, right off the coast of Turkey, if it wasn't for the Russo-Turkish war that saw the exchange of the island to Britain - the Island would probably still be in the hands of Turkey today, and the Greeks would have been been the target of a genocide like in Pontus, The fact Greece can walk away with the majority of the island, with the gas in the south isn't the worst thing in the world.

They won't be able to stop her. Once we have triggered Article 50, which will happen soon, parliament cannot untrigger it. If May ends up not liking the negotiation with the EU, she will not sign it and there will be nothing parliament can do about it.

As for lower corporation taxes, a lot of UK Tories want to lower them, to put us on the same level as Ireland. Even if we get a great deal with the EU, we might still lower corporation taxes.

&gt;  Do you think the British Parliament will let her do that? You're pro-Brexit so probably gonna say yes... is there a way for a ccoalition in the Parliament to force her to resign?

[Under the UK constitution, at any moment parliament can force May to resign, with a vote of no confidence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motions_of_no_confidence_in_the_United_Kingdom) But this is unlikely, because the Tories have a majority and it seems that almost all Tories, even the pro-EU ones, accept May's strategy. The first vote is tonight, but rumours are that there will only be one Tory rebel. Also, remember that Labour do not currently want new elections, because the Tories will gain seats and if anything it will make the Brexit harder.

&gt; More common in Europe than in the United States, the general strike has its roots in the British working class movement of the mid-1800s; one of the first major general strikes in the United Kingdom occurred in 1842, when unionists and Chartists led a massive strike for better wages and political reform.

&gt; In the United States, W.E.B. Du Bois characterized the tens of thousands of slaves who abandoned plantations during the Civil War as a &amp;quot;General strike against slavery.&amp;quot; He credited this general strike with winning the war for the Union by transferring the labor of the &amp;quot;Black worker&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;The Confederate planter to the Northern invader, in whose army lines workers began to be organized as a new labor force.""

&gt; More recent examples of general strikes include one in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2014 - in which workers called for increased wages and lower taxes in response to higher living costs - and a nationwide strike across India in 2016.

Firstly, if you want to not get immediately tired of the game again, don´t get the ALB Dios team, unless you want to have something that can kill any dungeon you´d want to farm with the click of a button each floor (it´s a matter of perspective, really, but it´s so unappealing to me that my Liu Bei is still not even on my to be evolved schedule.).


For teams I can recommend: Krishna is now very strong as a red mono color row team with great consistency for Arena 1, probably also Arena 2, not sure about 3. (There´s also Awoken Cao Cao who´s literally red ALB)


For blues you´ve got a really great box but not really any leaders worth mentioning apart from Skuld if you´d really want a blue team. If you could get your hands on Summer Myr in ~June (8* collab REM or 500k MP) you´d have a very solid team for her though, but she´s got no major advantage over the free light version (most people argue that she´s worse, you can hardly deal with Gaiadragon in A3 for example), but it´s something to keep in mind. There´s enough solid blue leads to pull that you could easily pick up with your sub choices!



Green teams to invest in are Bastet and Awoken Kushinada Hime, both combo leads, the latter being restricted with a no skyfall effect (perfect damage control being a perk of that!) and Bastet being restricted to active use. There´s also Kaede who you might find a bit difficult to sub though (she´s a great sub for the other two teams though).



Light is where your box really shines, since you´ve got a great team for Myr, a fully farmable lead that is currently ruling the top tier of leads since her release (somewhere 8-9 months ago...). You could clear her dungeon on your own or grab a coop partner to even carry you through (see your server´s respective discord, I´m from EU) and once she´s yours (and evolved, it´s a pain in the butt), you can strap on Apocalypse, ADQXQ, Wu Kong and Venus and you´ve already got yourself a top tier team, plus some very good inherits to use as well.



For dark you´ve got AAnubis if you´re REALLY into combos (new Revo can get you a x900), otherwise you could get Typhon´s Ana (look for a PADX dungeon that features her as a boss rotating through) and invest into that team if you´re into heartcross leads, she´s not that great though.",0,10,t3_5rg9v7,PuzzleAndDragons,deviant324,,0,t3_5rg9v7,j22,1485966531,

That's what I meant by 'hostility'. :) Plus defacement of Irish signs like the example recently posted on here. 

&gt; we hear very little about these forward-looking and progressive protestants. You say things have gotten worse and more hostility towards Irish now 

...I didn't say that at all! I just said there's still hostility 10 years later (curry my yoghurt, sign defacement, etc.). I'm saying I'd like an update now to include those positive things like Linda's experience and an uptake in east Belfast. As well as Líofa and the rise of the Gaelscoileanna - I've done some mentoring for An Droichead in the past so had good chats in there about an uptake in Irish learning. An updated show like this could help show that it's inclusive and share a bit more of the history for people who don't know. 

...So I think you misread me and we're actually in agreement. :) 

(Tho' I have to say I had the same view as yours about Ulster Scots - being from Aghadowey where it was all around me! - until I read a discussion on here last week that sent me on a bit of linguistic research. Now I see that there is a claim for it as a language. I started with this: https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/5q2bpn/25000_grant_for_ulster_scots_hall_that_does_not/dcw5fe1/ 

...and:

""Because there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English.[12] Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects do exist, these often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other.[13] Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, yet it has its own distinct dialects.[12]""
(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language)

""Linguistic status[edit]

Some linguists, such as Raymond Hickey,[36] treat Ulster Scots (and other forms of Scots) as a dialect of English. Other linguists treat it as a variety of the Scots language; Caroline Macafee, for example, writes that ""Ulster Scots is [...] clearly a dialect of Central Scots.""[9] The Concise Ulster Dictionary writes that ""Ulster Scots is one dialect of Lowland Scots, now officially regarded as a language by the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages.""[37] The Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure considers Ulster Scots to be ""the local variety of the Scots language.""[38] It has been said that its ""status varies between dialect and language"".[39]""
(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_dialects)

But I lost the best part of a day following links to that and can't afford to do that again! :) Just thought you might find it interesting. Oh, and I was playing Irish whistle for the bringing in of the haggis on a Robert Burns night in Spain last Friday, and there was a diner there from Ayrshire (as was the restaurant owner). She told me that they see Ulster Scots as almost indistinguishable from Scots in Ayr (not sure if that's Central or Lowland) and that my accent sounds pretty Ayrshire. English friends when I was at Queens almost all thought I was Scottish when they first met me.)

I do think there's wabbery and attempts to politicise language on both sides, but I don't give a feck what politics other people want to attach to their languages, I'd love to see people just claim it for themselves out of heritage or just the joy and benefits of learning languages. :)

Have a good day, whatever you're up to!

All of this was done under a ""emergency ordonance"". TBH this wouls have been totally fine, but it was enforces unfairly and he just shoved all his political oponents in prison, not to say they didn't do corrupt shit, but everyone stole and somehow, by pure coincidence, only the opposition party was getting in prison. 

Fast forward 1 and a half years and the supreme court just ruled all of those ordonances severely unconstitutional, like, violating equality under the law and the presumption of innocences levels of unconstitutional. 

Fast forward a few more months and parlamentary election season rolls around, the socialist party (the main opposition party to the president) runs on a platform of reforming the justice system and they win the most overwhelming parlamentaey victory in Romanian history, so overwhelming that it was the first time any party did not need to forn a coalition in order to govern, with the president's party winning a mere 20% of seats. 

Fast forward a few more weeks, and Romania is getting sanctioned by the european court because our prisons are so fucking inhumane because they are overpopulated. 

So then, in light of this sanction, the parliment passed the resolution reforming the criminal justice system and literally the only things changed where the things deemed unconstitutional. Most of it was to do with the presumtion of innocence and the power of law enforcement, but the most argued about thing was the change to workplace abuse (that's abusing your position not your co-workers, it's a pain in the ass to translate technical Romanian language) where, AS STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION of the country, damages of less than 200 000 RON (about €45 000) are a civil offence, not a criminal one, hence you are not a felon and you will be prosecuted in a civil court, have to pay back damages, etc. 

Beyond this, they passed amnesty to all non-violent criminals serving minor sentances, something less than 2 or 5 years, not 100% sure. So it's not like they just got theie buddies out, the people who stole millions have sentances of 30 years, they are staying where they are. 

And now the president is going on the news calling for riots. And the morons on the streets who hate the socialist party for the sake of hating it (I'm not a huge of them myself either), are calling to have what was one of the most overwhelmingly decisive elections reversed.

&gt; fairly biased

To only describe this as ""fairly biased"" is insufficient. It is unhinged polemic.

I'll take a stab at your specific question at the end but I want to also address her other points in the video:

&gt; All of her garbage about Osama bin Laden choosing the date for 9/11 based on the battle of Vienna also having been on 9/11.

First off, as far as I'm aware [the Battle of Vienna took place on 9/12.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna)

I don't want to break the 20 year rule but insofar as she is making a historiographical claim about the centrality of the battle of Vienna in the Islamic world and among Salafi Jihadist Islamists I feel it's worth addressing. The date for the 9/11 attacks was selected by Mohammed Atta, who was not in direct contact with Bin Laden at the time. There is no suggestion in any credible sources that I've read that Atta selected the date for any particular reason; the ticket bookings were made last-minute between August 25 and September 5.

Moreover, Bin Laden wanted the ""airplanes plot"" to be carried out as soon as possible (i.e. earlier than they eventually were) recommending an attack be carried out immediately with no preparation as early as 2000. The only anniversary he suggested was 12 May 2001, seven months after the USS Cole bombing. He also suggested June or July 2001 when Ariel Sharon was expected to visit the White House.

You can read all of this in the 9/11 commission report [here](https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf), on pages 249-250.

She also describes it as being in ""the Islamic calendar."" The Islamic calendar is a distinct dating system. 9/11/1683 in the Islamic calendar would have been the 20th day of the 9th month (Ramadan) of 1094. 9/11/2001 was the 23rd day of the 6th month (Jumad ath-Thani) of 1422.

&gt; ""The industrial revolution...in order to stop the Muslims...was how they were able to stop them at the gates of Vienna on 9/11.""

I have never come across any suggestion that the countries that defeated the Ottomans in 1683 were experiencing an industrial revolution, or that any such a thing contributed to their victory.

Also is she suggesting that the *purpose* of the industrial revolution was to fight Muslims? The industrial revolution involved increases in production in mining and textiles and to a certain extent other manufactures and emerged in the part of Europe that spent the least amount of time ""fighting the Muslims.""

&gt; Islam had covered more of the earth's surface than the Roman Empire did at it's peak.

What does this even mean? Assuming that it's something like, the territorial extent of the empires whose rulers follow Islam, then the proper comparison is to Christianity, which was far larger at this point having begun its conquest of the New World in 1492.

Also, how is that relevant? Is that supposed to make Islam scary because it was bigger than the Romans? [Smashes head against wall repeatedly].

&gt; Everything about Ataturk.

Look. Anti-semitism in the contemporary Middle East is a problem. You can find someone, somewhere who thinks that someone was a crypto-Jew. I have heard figures as diverse as Muammar Gaddafi, Osama bin Laden, Nasser, Erdogan, etc. all described as crypto-Jews. ""Muslims"" writ large do not think Ataturk was a crypto-Jew.

&gt; All of her muddling of Islamic Empire, Islamic Caliphate, Islamic State.

No. She needs to be precise with her terms. The Caliphate by this point was a title held by the Sultans of the Ottoman empire. Its end in 1924 was a contingent event. Sharif Hussein of the Kingdom of Hejaz, once the Caliphate had been abolished, attempted to claim the title for himself. It was the Saudis (ironically, given her subsequent description of her role in the resurrection of the ""Caliphate"" as ISIS) and their conquest of the Hejaz that ultimately prevented another Caliphate from emerging.

&gt; 270 million people killed

[Citation needed.]

&gt; Islamists resurrect the Caliphate

As I said there was a credible claim to a successor Caliphate almost immediately. So none of her reasons for how it re-emerged are necessary.

&gt; Discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia

I mean, is she suggesting that Middle Eastern oil was *only* discovered by Americans in Saudi Arabia? Because there was plenty of oil discovered by the others elsewhere.

&gt; Khomeini

I mean, this is non-ridiculous in that the Iranian revolution did inspire Sunni and Shia Islamists alike despite the regions current with sectarian conflagration, but there's a bit of a cause and effect problem. Khomeini did not spring from the earth ex-nihilo. There had to have been (and there were) existing Islamist movements in the rest of the Muslim world who could be inspired.

&gt; Wahhabists

I mean, the irony here is that she's repeating Wahhabi propaganda. *They* certainly claim to practice ""true"" Islam, but that's to deny the truth of every other form of Islam that is practiced.

&gt; Mecca

This proscription against non-Muslims entering Mecca was not put in place by the Saudis/Wahhabists. The Ottomans had the same proscription. I'm not sure how old it is, but Richard Burton in the 19th century certainly had to enter the city incognito.

&gt; al-Qaeda praising Saudi Arabia

[Citation needed]. 

This part actually doesn't violate the 20 year rule, happily. Osama bin Laden was stripped of Saudi citizenship after having already been exiled from the country in 1994 for his *criticism* of the ruling family.

&gt; Taqqiya

This is most commonly a Shia doctrine of dissimulation that only applies under specific circumstances, notably threat to ones own life. I'd be happy to cite Salafi Jihadi texts that specifically deny that a Jihadist can lie, and that instead they should practice deliberate ambiguity.

&gt; Prophet Muhammad...made money without working

Is she really suggesting that Muhammad invented tribal raiding?

&gt; Broke peace treaty

No Christian has ever broken a peace treaty.

&gt; Arafat didn't even wait 10 years for the Oslo Accords

Article 1 of the Oslo accords stated that there would be a transitional period of 5 years during which a final status agreement would be negotiated, commencing no later than 3 years after the signing.

Then it gets into 20 year stuff that I can't discuss, but the point is that Oslo was not a final status treaty and mentions nothing about a 10-year truce.

&gt; Sharia law and polls

I can't really address this except that I'll note that she is butchering the social science of this.

---------------------

Now as to your original question:

&gt; ""How 'progressive' (or not) was the religion tax imposed by Islamic countries (I have heard of more than one doing this) in comparison to other countries in regards to tolerating other religions?""

This is a really expansive question. Happily I think I've addressed it in large part before [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4dszce/during_the_very_early_years_of_islam_what_were/) among other places, which also touches on your other question about the treatment of minorities under Islam generally.

Sourcewise, I mean, her comments are so scattershot going as they do from the 7th century to the 21st, that it's hard to recommend a specific source. I guess I would recommend *Islam: A Very Short Introduction* because the speaker doesn't know what she's talking about at a very basic level.

That being said, I'd be happy to recommend more on a specific topic if it's of interest.

Pour la famine :
""En 2004, le Darfour, au Soudan, est touché par une famine. En 2005, au Niger, la malnutrition a touché plus de 3,5 millions de personnes dont 800 000 enfants. Plus de 100 000 personnes sont décédées. En 2005 selon la FAO environ 16 000 enfants dans le monde meurent par jour de maladies liées à la faim et à la malnutrition.

La crise alimentaire mondiale de 2007-2008, ayant eu pour origine une forte hausse du prix des denrées alimentaires de base, plongeant dans un état de crise quelques-unes des régions les plus pauvres du monde et causant une instabilité politique et des émeutes dans plusieurs pays.

À partir de 2011, une importante famine touche la Corne de l'Afrique avec des centaines de morts par jour.""

Au passage, la forte hausse du prix des denrées alimentaires de base a eu lieu à cause de la spéculation du monde de la finance!

Quand tu parles des jeunes qui n'ont jamais autant voyagé, tu parles de tes enfants ou des 8 millions de pauvres vivant sous le seuil de pauvreté en France ou des enfants de migrants? En Allemagne qui doit être un modèle pour toi, on atteint les 12,5 millions de personnes sous le seuil de pauvreté (à 60% sous le salaire médian qui est la définition habituellement retenue)...

Tu sembles opposer le libéralisme (que les US imposent aux autres mais évitent de pratiquer. Ils sont en effet très protectionnistes) au communisme. Mais Mélenchon n'est pas communiste et le programme de la France Insoumise est loin du communisme. C'est un programme social et humaniste qui met donc en avant l'humain plutôt qu'une croissance qui ne profite qu'aux plus riches et à la finance ce qui est très net quand tu regardes la répartition des richesses (voir le dernier rapport de l'oxfam : 8 milliardaires aussi riches que les 50% les plus pauvres, en France 21 personnes aussi riches que les 40% les plus pauvres)... Que font donc ces ultra-riches de leur pognon? Quel intérêt même pour eux? 

L'Avenir en Commun c'est juste redonner du sens à l'économie qui doit être au service de tous les humains et non au service du ""marché"". C'est l'entreprise pour l'humain et non l'humain pour l'entreprise.

&gt;On May 14, 1948, the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the Jewish People's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation which declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel. The declaration was made by David Ben-Gurion, the Executive Head of the World Zionist Organization.[34]

&gt;There were no mention of the borders of the new state other than that it was in Eretz Israel. In an official cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the UN Secretary-General on May 15, 1948, the Arab stated publicly that Arab Governments found ""themselves compelled to intervene for the sole purpose of restoring peace and security and establishing law and order in Palestine."" 

&gt;[..]

&gt;That day, the armies of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq invaded/intervened in what had just ceased to be the British Mandate, marking the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

There was no month later. Also, the civil war was in effect for decades, and started in answer to the Arab attacks towards Jews and the British limitations of Jewish immigration.

See the 1929 [Hebron Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre), and as it says [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#1930s_and_1940s)..

&gt;In the mid-1930s Izz ad-Din al-Qassam arrived from Syria and established the Black Hand, an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. He recruited and arranged military training for peasants and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jewish settlers in the area, as well as engaging in a campaign of vandalism of Jewish settler plantations.[24] By 1936, escalating tensions led to the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.[25]

&gt;In response to Arab pressure,[26] the British Mandate authorities greatly reduced the number of Jewish immigrants to Palestine (see White Paper of 1939 and the SS Exodus). These restrictions remained in place until the end of the mandate, a period which coincided with the Nazi Holocaust and the flight of Jewish refugees from Europe. As a consequence, most Jewish entrants to Mandatory Palestine were considered illegal (see Aliyah Bet), causing further tensions in the region. Following several failed attempts to solve the problem diplomatically, the British asked the newly formed United Nations for help. On May 15, 1947, the General Assembly appointed a committee, the UNSCOP, composed of representatives from eleven states.[27] To make the committee more neutral, none of the Great Powers were represented.[28] After five weeks of in-country study, the Committee reported to the General Assembly on September 3, 1947.[29] The Report contained a majority and a minority plan. The majority proposed a Plan of Partition with Economic Union. The minority proposed The Independent State of Palestine. With only slight modifications, the Plan of Partition with Economic Union was the one the adoption and implementation of which was recommended in resolution 181(II) of November 29, 1947.[30] The Resolution was adopted by 33 votes to 13 with 10 abstentions. All six Arab states who were UN-members voted against it. On the ground, Arab and Jewish Palestinians were fighting openly to control strategic positions in the region. Several major atrocities were committed by both sides.[31]

As for 56 and 67, it was Egypt who twice closed the Straits of Tiran to Israel, which violated the 1949 Armistice Agreement. For more details on 67:

&gt;On May 19, 1967, Egypt expelled UNEF observers,[52] and deployed 100,000 soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula.[53] It again closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping,[54][55] returning the region to the way it was in 1956 when Israel was blockaded.

&gt;On May 30, 1967, Jordan signed a mutual defense pact with Egypt. Egypt mobilized Sinai units, crossing UN lines (after having expelled the UN border monitors) and mobilized and massed on Israel's southern border. On June 5, Israel launched an attack on Egypt. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) destroyed most of the Egyptian Air Force in a surprise attack, then turned east to destroy the Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi air forces.[56] This strike was the crucial element in Israel's victory in the Six-Day War.[53][55] At the war's end, Israel had gained control of the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), Shebaa farms, and the Golan Heights. The results of the war affect the geopolitics of the region to this day.

So, yeah. This is not Civilisation V, you actually do react when your hostile neighbours arrive with their troops at your borders. War was started the moment they kicked out the UN and closed the Straits of Tiran.",0,-2,t1_dd710w5,worldnews,TheMaskedTom,,0,t3_5ra6c3,,1485968920,

There are minor wars fought during this, but nothing huge. The major European wars are all spaced out in this way.

Between the 100 years war and the Italian wars was about one century from beginning of the former to beginning of the latter.

From the Italian wars to the 30 years War, was about one century. 

Between the 30 years war and the War of Spanish Succession there was about a century. 

Between the War of Spanish Succession and the Napoleonic Wars there was about one century.

Between the Napoleonic Wars and WWI there was about a century. I count WWII as a continuation of WWI just as you would with the 30 years war or 100 years war, Napoleaonic/French Revolution war, and the Italian wars which were all inter-generational and had times of armistice between them. 

There is always like three or four generations of peace, between which you have Pax Hispanica, Pax Britannia, Pax Americana and other such hegemonies by the winner of these massive coalition wars. They rule the seas during these times of peace. And trade is good and so are economics. But then things start to fall apart for the leading power, because leading is costly. Rising powers step in, the leading power won't give way and then war is inevitable. Sometimes the rising power wins. Sometimes the rising power loses, but one of its allies steps to the plane of hegemony.

 I don't think the past 70 years are at all unique. These times pop up in history very often. I don't think the fact that the stage is the globe rather than Europe makes it too different. And I don't think we're much wiser than our forebears that it won't happen again.

And we all rely on these businesses to come to the EU, employ our people and make our lives better. We also want to be able to send our businesses to other places to, without them being mistreated.

Agreed. That's why we shouldn't get the money of the 99% of the business to subsidise Apple.

&gt; Apple customers pay a huge twack of VAT in every country they operate in. That pays for roads, clean water, education etc in the place the products are consumed. Taxes on profits are totally different to consumption taxes, they should be taxed in the places products are created, not consumed. Ireland's tax law recognises that Apple makes most of its products in California, not Europe, not Ireland (though a small amount of value is created here).

Same as the customers of 100% of the other companies.

&gt; States in the EU set their own tax rules. You can't argue with the fact of that, because its true. The commission doesn't have the power to set or influence taxes. So in this case it got pissed off, chose the biggest pot of profit it could find and tried to get some of it through the back way, state aid.

They do. If you think this is a tax issue you're misinformed...

The problem is Ireland subsidised Apple with tax tricks and didn't do it for other companies. That is a state subsidy, which is not permitted inside the EU.

&gt; If Ireland applied its own tax rules to apple, in a way that was on offer to other companies in the same situation, then the EU commission has no argument about state aid. It already knows it has no power over Ireland's tax.

Unfortunately it wasn't available for other companies.

&gt; If apple paid what it was asked to pay in tax then that's it. The idea you can make up a new rule and apply it retrospectively is not something that we should be encouraging in europe.

I figured i could handle it and declared war and used Paris as my foothold. And  for the next 15 turns or so the garrison when against at least a dozen full stack armies besieging the city before I got enough reinforcements in to start and push them back. But sadly the game will no longer advance in any turns due to the amount of armies on the screen.

 **comment content**: Technically Incorrect. The UK must write Directives (but not Regulations) into the own laws, in their own fashion, as all member states do. Directives are more of a framework for a goal that needs achieving, not how to do them. 

The more rarer regulations that take precedence over member state laws and don't need rewriting are typically reserved for things the EU member states have all signed up to on an international level, like the Paris Climate Change Treaty. 

Either way in all steps of legislation, the member states have a say. In the European Parliament, through their chosen Commissioner or on the Council where each Head of State (or Government if you have a monarchy) must agree on a super majority basis.

Part of it is the Greek governments fault, their financial decisions have not been the best to put it mildly.

That said, what's happened to them because of the EU is absolutely disgusting.  
What you need to understand is that the Euro, the common currency of the EU, means that many of the traditional ways a country can boost their economy and foster trade/tourism and so on (by manipulating their currency's value) are simply not available anymore. The Euro is, naturally, focused on Germany. In fact European economic policy is pretty much just ""whatever will earn Germany the most money"", and whether or not you benefit is directly tied to how similar your needs are to those of Germany.  
This all means that when the Greek economy started tanking, the easiest way out of it was blocked by the Euro and Germany.  

Okay, not a catastrophe you say, there are other ways out of an economic crash. Well, you gotta spend money to earn money, as they say. In fact as has been proven time and time again and we've known since John Maynard Keynes explained it all in the fucking 1930s. Not only do austerity measures not work but in fact they simply worsen economic recession.  
You have to spend money, you have to build things, you have to create an industry of some kind. This is why Hitler succeeded in revitalizing the German economy, it's the basis of FDRs ""new deal"", it's how Obama managed to avoid the crash in 2008!  
This is in no way whatsoever a secret!

Okay, so back to Greece. Their economy is tanking, they're unable to control their currency, debts are piling up. What do you do?  
Well, the EU (or more accurately, Germany) decided that the EU would lend them some money and in return Greece would turn to austerity. Now, as any idiot with basic understanding of economics (or who bothered to read the above paragraph) know the last thing the Greek economy needs at that point in time is austerity.  
The Greek knew this, they rejected austerity. As a result Germany said ""fuck you, you think this is your country or something? You're doing austerity and that's the fucking last of it!"" (I'm paraphrasing).

The Greek economy is in a contineous downward spiral that they can't recover from, which is bad. Their hospitals are unable to treat people dying needlessly. Well fuck, this is a PR disaster! If this gets out it could kill the EU!  
Curiously, at this point in time Merkel decides to invite in a shitton of refugees and makes public statements that lead to a crisis for the entirety of the EU (and even worse strain on the Greeks as thousands upon thousands of refugees land there seeking entry to the EU).  

Now, I'm not gonna say it was done to distract people from the Greeks, I will say the timing is pretty curious because just as Germany's decisions lead to a collapse of the Greek healthcare industry leading to people dying like flies the headlines are suddenly dominated (and have remained so since) by refugees.  
The refugees had been there for like 2 years before Merkel made her comments and the refugee situation in the world has been getting steadily worse for decades (there are 60 million plus in the world). Weirdly enough the news and Merkel herself for that matter decided to start giving a fuck, but only about those specific refugees from that neatly placed nearby warzone. The specific warzone where the people fleeing from it curiously often have to travel through Greece...

Now, what are the Greeks gonna do? They have a massive debt issue that is pretty much controlled by Germany, they have no control over their currency, there are thousands of refugees landing on their shores seeking passage through the country that they absolutely need the EU to have any chance of handling, and in the midst of all that thousands of their citizens are dying needlessly in their hospitals because there is no money for medical treatment. 

No seriously, tell me, what the fuck are the Greek gonna do? Talk shit to Germany? The country controlling their debts? The country that is paying for or getting others to pay for what little help the Greeks get? The country that can fuck up the handling process for the massive amount of refugees that they have no chance of handling on their own?  
Germany has some freaky weird ass diplomatic triple submission hold on them, if Greece starts complaining Germany can choke them out, break their arm, and tear off their knee joint. 

Oh, and remember, smile! The EU has made it so you don't have roaming fees! Isn't that great? Now look away while they make that European army they've been trying to create, they need it to handle scary scary Russia and scary man Trump. No no, it's just for that, they won't use it for anything else. Now repeat after me *""EU-Mitgliedschaft ist freiwillig und wir sind alle glücklich ein teil der zukunft vereinten Europa zu sein""*.  
It's not going to be a problem. After all, when has Germany building armies and seeking to unify Europe under them ^cough excuse me,,, under *our* cooperative leadership ever bitten anyone in the ass?

To many Arab Muslims at the time, the English and French were an axis of evil that destroyed their country, so anyone fighting them must be good. And Hitler knew this was the sentiment which is why he reached out to Muslims in the Middle East. Add to that growing resentment of Jews in Palestine because this is when Jewish settlements first started occurring, and you get many Muslim people who did favor the Nazis.

Also realize that throughout Asia and Africa, people at the time and even now have a general positive image of Hitler. The British and French conquered most of the world and raped it for resources. To many people in Asia, they were able to get independence because Hitler fought the British and French. They don't really care if Hitler killed Jews, Hitler's enemies were killing them!

&gt;In other areas, however, there is less unity.

Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.

&gt;Across the seven Muslim-majority countries and territories surveyed, a median of 68% of Muslims said they view Westerners as selfish. Considerable shares also called Westerners other negative adjectives, including violent (median of 66%), greedy (64%) and immoral (61%), while fewer attributed positive characteristics like “respectful of women” (44%), honest (33%) and tolerant (31%) to Westerners.

So delivery was fast, good packaging, cleanly labeled plastic bags with kratom powder which looks good... finely grained powder of consistent color, which I guess is how kratom is supposed to look like.

So I weighed 2.5 grams of Sumatra Green Vein which according to an older but quite comprehensive test I found is a good dose for this strain. (For that test they actually ordered the kratom from kratom.eu, where I bought mine.)

Well, that was 40 minutes ago and I don't really feel anything. According to this test Sumatra Green Vein is one of the best for motivation and euphoria. But I feel just like before. So I just took another 1.5 grams for 4 grams total.

How much do you guys take when you do green vein? Maybe 2.5 or 4 grams is too little?

edit: Now I took 6 grams total and I may be slightly less tired but basically still no effect. I expected kratom would have a really clear effect but I feel even less effect than I did when I tried 2 grams of phenibut last week (was also first-time use).

According to the 1940 census, there were 6,931 working ""actors"" in the United States; by the middle of 1942, 3,503 (a full 50 percent) had been inducted into the military, a far higher percentage than for valued occupations such as machinists and agricultural workers. War workers and men who were married had dependents (until the end of 1943) were usually deferred from being drafted if their induction would cripple a war industry or cause unnecessary hardship to their families. I previously covered the [experience of the draftee in a very long post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/561vrb/what_was_boot_campmilitary_training_like_during/), but I will summarize in a few paragraphs below.

With the passage of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (September 16, 1940) all men between the ages of 21 and 35 (21st birthday to the last day of the 35th year) were required to register to potentially be selected for one year's peacetime military service in the Western Hemisphere or U.S. territories. On August 18, 1941, seeing the events transpiring in Europe, President Roosevelt extended the draftees' term of service for an additional 18 months.

To conduct the registration, the United States was divided up into 6,443 draft boards, each exercising control of a maximum of 30,000 residents to avoid going over the Selective Service-mandated limit of 7,836 age-eligible males. Men in each district were sent the D.S.S. Form 40 (an eight-page general questionnaire) and the D.S.S. Form 311 (an occupational questionnaire) to be filled out and returned within ten days. Each registrant then received the D.S.S. Form 57, a notice to report for a medical examination and classification (I-A; eligible for unrestricted military service, to IV-F; physically, mentally, or morally unfit) This classification, along with a random draft order number from 1 to 7,836 (if applicable) was printed on the D.S.S. Form 2, or draft registration card, which a man had to carry with him at all times.

Immediately after Pearl Harbor, the Selective Training and Service Act was amended in order to make all men aged 18 to 37 liable for induction, and all men aged 18 to 45 liable for some form of military service if the need arose. In 1942, men aged 45 to 64 were required to register as well, (but they were not liable for service) to create an inventory of those men who could be put to work in war industry. On December 5, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9279, which made it so that men who were 18 to 37 could not voluntarily enlist anymore, but could only be drafted, to avoid disrupting the United States' war manpower and causing undue stress on the military. Those men who were 17 and 38 to 45 could still voluntarily enlist, provided they met the military's qualifications. The Navy (and Marine Corps) were not placed under the authority of the Selective Service until early 1943; previously, all draftees went to the Army, and all Navy men were volunteers.

Throughout the registrations of 1941 and 1942, dates were given upon which groups of men of the specified age were to report for registration; beginning on January 1, 1943, formal registration ""days"" were stopped and all men were required by law to register on their 18th birthday or as soon as possible afterwards. Beginning also on January 1, 1943, ""random"" draft order numbers were scrapped, replaced with a system that assigned each birth date its own unique sequential number.

If a man's number was selected, he was sent a letter which told him to report for military service in the branch selected for him (in this case, the Army; the Selective Service established monthly quotas for each branch of the military, and divided them up proportionally to each state, where boards picked men based upon the results of their physical and mental examinations, as well as ""quality"" guidelines given by each service) at a local induction station, where another medical examination was performed. If the examination was passed, the man was administered the Soldier's Oath and inducted into the Enlisted Reserve Corps of the United States Army. He was given one week to clear up any personal matters, and reported back to the induction station for placement onto active duty and transport to a reception center, where the process of qualification testing and classification into a military occupational specialty took place; the man, along with others classified similarly to him or assigned to the same unit, would then proceed to his assigned training location.

t5_2zvvb,1488475310,False,False,,dd75821,"I think this is partially symptomatic of the larger problem in this game. Namely that Europe (And a small section of Asia that is the Japan/China war) is literally the only area that matters to the gameplay. 

In the real war, you have the declaration, the fall of Poland, the fall of France. The game does these decently well. However, it does an incredibly bad job from here on out. Naval invasion is one of the costliest, slowest, most thoroughly planned things in warfare. In game? It isn't. Of course it isn't, because the game leaves literally everything except a few cities completely undefended. Player or AI, there is almost no reason you should EVER have to invade a fortified position unless it is a one tile island. 

That wasn't true during the actual war. There the allies faced a massively fortified coastline and the serious risk that a beachhead would be destroyed if the enemy moved in. They literally spent YEARS on a misinformation campaign so that the Germans would think the Dday landing was a feint to make them move their troops away from Calais. 

This meant that the war in Europe was a stalemate. Invasion was impossible. The result was that the war shifted to North Africa, to Greece, eventually to Italy. In the game? None of this matters. Losing the Suez canal, something that would have devastated the Allied war effort, doesn't even get a pop-up. Not that it matters, because the AI will never try to take it. And even if they do, it won't matter, because this game makes the biggest threat the allies faced irrelevant. The threat that the British could be cut off and starved from their empire. You could blockade their island for decades and it won't do anything. Take all their colonies? Nothing. Bomb their industry into oblivion? Meh. The same applies in reverse. 

Basically, this game makes no effort to simulate any of the non-military factors that affected warfare. It also makes no attempt to simulate passive parts of warfare (Garrisons along coasts, for example). It's all about constant attacking. Removing the reckless naval invasions won't do anything other than put lipstick on the pig, the fact that unless you or the AI is actively taking territory in Europe or actively fighting enemy divisions, the war might as well not be happening. There are no second fronts, all the major powers can only be really beaten if you take their territory in Europe and you can't wear your enemy down or bomb them into submission. Naval invasions are pretty much the only way for fighting to occur at all.

Congress approved under bush a specific budget, what trump has proposed and campaigned on was a much larger more costly project.

And again not what he campaigned on. His words were that Mexico would pay for it, and that is not what is happening. 

Obama put sanctions in place to try to punish and use as leverage against Russia to get them out of Ukraine, trump says he plans to lift all sanctions against Russia. Basically saying they can have Ukraine with no consequences. 

Paying their fair share is not what I was talking about, and there are better ways to go about doing that. What he has done has destabilized our treaties with long standing allies. That is a fact and whatever his reasons were.  Our NATO allies stood with us when we were attacked and we are not standing with them while they are being threatened. European countries have already started talking about the need for an EU coalition of armed forces, that will likely further destabilize the region.

Cos that's not racist.

&gt; As a massive fan of football (European version) black players are overrepresented compared to other ethnic groups.

I didn't say anything about how represented they were *in the sport*. I said how represented they were at the top-flight compared with the bottom-flight. If you were correct that there's a broad athletic superiority associated with high melanin content, then the top teams (*taking the better players*) would have a lot more black players than the bottom ones. It's not the case.

&gt; I'm sure it's just culture that all but a handful of men to run 100m under 10 seconds are of western African lineage.

Ok, this is like saying White People are genetically predisposed towards getting skin cancer. It's both entirely true and *utterly meaningless*. The inheritance of physiological characteristics does not ipso-facto mean that massive segregation along *completely arbitrary* ethnic lines is an obvious result.

Never mind that your position that ethnicity is some ancient and inviolable constant is a crock of shit. It's now impossible, via genetic studies, to determine where in Africa the ancestors of 90% of the Caribbean population were from. The studies haven't been done, but it's expected to be the same in the US, although it might well be confounded by the fact that the average African American genome is *twenty five percent* [ethnic European](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans) in origin.

This is, of course, leaving aside that *race* - i.e. 'White' and 'Black' is a meaningless fiction. The (*black*) population in Africa is literally the furthest removed, genetically, from the (*black*) indigenous population of Australia. There are *at least* two white-skinned ethnic supergroups (*caucasians and slavs*).

&gt; Hybrid vigour does not apply to humans

That study has nothing to do with hybrid vigor, and couldn't possibly prove it's presence or absence either way.

The sad reality is also that terrible things now happen so frequently in the West, you kinda get a bit dulled to all of it.

For example, Germany is my neighboring country and even here the Berlin attack didn't get anywhere close to the same reaction the Paris attacks got. Because between then and now, it feels like there was an attack every single week.

So if even our closest neighbor can't bring out a big reaction in us anymore, something all the way in Canada also won't.

&gt; La Fondation travaille alors avec une société, EAR (Refasso), dirigée par Christian Beder, qui dispose de la plus grande base de données du monde associatif. Mais après plus de deux ans de collaboration, Bernard Marie juge les prétentions financières de EAR trop élevées. Christian Beder tente de trouver une solution avec Florimont Olive, le petit-fils de Bernard Marie et neveu de MAM. «Puis, du jour au lendemain, je n’ai plus eu de nouvelles», explique Christian Beder. Coïncidence? Au même moment, sa base de données est «aspirée», victime d’une attaque informatique de la DRM, la direction du renseignement militaire, qui dépend du ministère de la Défense, dirigé par Michèle Alliot-Marie, et dont la nièce, Ludivine Olive, la sœur de Florimont, est chef de cabinet. «La DRM a reconnu avoir aspiré ma base de données, mais nous a expliqué qu’il s’agissait d’un test et que ma société avait été choisie au hasard», raconte Christian Beder. Ce dernier a depuis attaqué en justice, et la DRM devant le Tribunal administratif de Paris, et la Fondation du bénévolat, au civil, pour «rupture abusive de pourparlers». Débouté en première instance dans les deux procédures l’an passé, il a fait appel devant la Cour administrative d’appel et la Cour d’appel d’Aix-en-provence. Quant à sa société, elle a été placée en redressement judiciaire.

I am well aware of the higher amount of warlike language in the Kuran than some other holy texts. I think it does pose problems, perhaps more than other religions. But I don't think that Islam is automatically or necessarily violent because of it.

Prior to the rise of extremist theocratic Islam in countries like Syria and Iran in the 60s (being generous) to the present, they were really not that different from the U.S., despite still being populated and ruled by Muslims. People there dressed like us, enjoyed western media unhindered, and Islam was a superficial difference at best.

The last major world power that was predominantly Muslim was the Ottoman empire, which after its early days was famously tolerant of people practicing different religions as long as they followed the laws, far more so than say, Europe during the Inquisition. Areas conquered by the Ottomans often found themselves living very similar day-to-day lives as they had before, so despite the fact that they did a lot of conquering, violent conversion wasn't exactly a hallmark of their reign. European imperialism, religiously guided or not, was not nearly so kind to the natives of the Americas, Africa, and India.

&gt;I will not deny that there are followers of Islam that does not view violence as the solution. The problem is, they do not even criticize it.

But they do. Countless mosques and Muslims speak up after any incidence of extremist violence and publicly declare that it is not something they stand for. You can doubt their sincerity all you want, or it's even possible that you may not have heard about it (it doesn't get a lot of coverage because the media likes spewing hatred more), but it is absolutely false that they don't criticize it.

And furthermore, there are (as you said yourself) definitely more Muslims that have never done anything particularly violent than those who have. I really don't see why they can't *all* be assumed to fall into the category that thinks violence is not the solution until proven otherwise.

&gt;But at the end of the day, they respect individualism and freedom of ideas. It does not put a full stop to future and hope. Islam is the exact opposite. The doctrine of Muhammad is the ultimate truth.

""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."" - Jesus.

Muhammad is not the only one who can claim ""ultimate truth"" status by the letter of his holy book. There is not a lot of room for interpretation there. The respect for individualism and freedom of ideas is not a Christian tenet, it is a cultural ideal that in ""modern"" times dates to the Renaissance and enlightenment periods, and has roots even further back in ancient Greece. These ideals may seem perfectly compatible with Christianity now, but they have absolutely not always been so. But in the end it sounds like the culture of the Renaissance and enlightenment overcame a dogmatic insistence that Christianity was the only acceptable way. This past insistence was not only widely believed, but legally and violently enforced during times like the Crusades and the Inquisition.",0,1,t1_dd6j8ey,AskThe_Donald,vortexofdoom,,0,t3_5r96me,vet,1485973551,
t5_2remi,1488475955,False,False,Doin' it till it hertz,dd76b1c,"Have you ever worked with ribbons before? They can be challenging to use live, but very rewarding if you put the time in to learn their inns and outs. Because, with rare exception, they have a figure-of-eight polar pickup pattern, they tend to do well on loud sources that don't require much gain. On quieter sources, the bleed gets pretty bad, when running ribbons live. However, the null spots are quite deep, so you can and should use this to your advantage.

You haven't specified what genre you're working with, so I can't really give you genre-specific instruction, but I do use ribbons almost exclusively in the studio, so here's my impression of the AEA mics:

_KU4_ - This is the finest microphone ever made. It costs $4k, it's the size of a parking meter, but it sounds incredible. This is based of the RCA KU3 (History Lesson, AEA got their start manufacturing parts for the RCA44, and most of AEA's mics are clones of old RCA ribbons. When the germans were developing 'kondensor' microphones, the Americans were making ribbons) and the KUA3 was a mic they'd use on a huge boom on sound stages for recording films. It's got an acoustic chamber behind the ribbon element, and this is the only cardioid ribbon that AEA makes. Again, this thing is fucking enormous, but use it on vocals if you can. I spoke to Andres Scheps last year, and he told me that after moving to Europe, he sold all of his outboard to go ITB, and the only two microphones he kept are the KU4s.

_R84/A840_ This is AEA's version of the RCA 77 ribbon. The R84 is a traditional ribbon, while the A840 has active circuitry (a preamp) and requires phantom power. I really like this microphone for drums. Not so much close-mic'ing, but as a mono overhead, or as room-mics in the studio. Virtually any time I attempted a 2-mic drum recording in the studio, the A840 was at least 1/2 of the microphones. Use it live as a mono overhead, or put it on a straight stand for classy vocals, bgvs, or horns.

_R92_ This is one of AEA's own creations. It's got the best windscreen of any of their microphones, and sounds great as close-mic for drums. If you've never worked with ribbons, the general wisdom is that they are very delicate, and this is true, but they're still strong enough to stand up to any 'sound' or SPL you can throw at them. However, the wind generated by carrying one in your hand and walking across the stage, will blow the element. But, to be fair, it's not-at-all expensive to re-ribbon mics. The R92 is great on snare, and I use it on bass amps in the studio with great effect.

_R88_ This is AEA's only stereo ribbon. Warning, it's the largest microphone I've ever seen. If you want to run a stereo overhead, this is your guy. I've also used it on guitar amps (mid-side config, to spice up chorus's or whatever). It always reminds me of the torture droid from star wars.

_N8/N22_ This is AEA's new, 'modern' active ribbon line. The N8 is 'flat' while the N22 is tuned for singer songwriters. Don't bother with the N22, it's garbage. The N8 is 'ok' it's cheap, and works anywhere you'd put a ribbon, but I'm not a huge fan of the sound.",0,5,t3_5rgdzs,livesound,CommonModeReject,,0,t3_5rgdzs,,1485973552,

Illegal immigration of the form that's happening in Europe cannot happen here because 1) it's hard to physically get here other than through legal means and 2) Latin American countries aren't accepting refugees/Muslims at a rate that would lead to a significant influx across the border (seriously, show me a shred of evidence that that's happening other than from Trump's twitter feed). 

And what fucking measurement for financial stability would you like to use to back up your backwards-ass claims that they do not help? Do you wanna use an anecdote? Because I can help you with that: why don't you sit your stupid ass down and have a look at Germany and their current financial state (yes they're spending more, but damn do they have a fuckton more production and economic gains). Please tell me exactly where that problem is. They ARE paying taxes once they come here or to Germany. There are such things as refugee help programs, but they provide a ton more output than input.

And the ads? Great! That's illegal immigration that CANT FUCKING PHYSICALLY HAPPEN TO AMERICA BECAUSE OF THE ATLANTIC FUCKING OCEAN. Also, I checked up on that, evidently you read infowars (did you even check the sourcing? They tend to make shit up and overblow it as if it's how everyone thinks that's not with them).

Xenophobic is about the foreigners, and Arab is an ethnicity, dipshit. It should be implied seeing as how closely related being Arab and Muslim are (not exactly the same, but close), but I know it's hard for your small brain to extrapolate, so I guess I should spell it out for you completely next time. Maybe we need to come up with another ""-ism"" to describe religious discrimination? I'd rather not since it should've been obvious from context, but I guess we can if you're that dense.

Next, I would gladly visit one of the (non-war torn) countries, but unfortunately, the west has been dicking around in the Middle East since WWII and creating chaos that still exists today. I guess Qatar and UAE and Saudi Arabia would be nice right now though. But other than that, I'd rather stick with my home country that I've grown to love, like most people would. And I would like to share that greatness with those who aren't so fortunate. Why do you feel so fucking entitled? Congrats, you happened to be born within specific borders, and that's great, but if someone wants to come here, that should be their right (so long as they go through the proper vetting channels). And please, if you're so educated, please tell me how this happens ""over and over in US history"". I do recall that pretty much every time a new round of immigrants starts coming here, the ""true Americans"" (whatever the fuck that means) get angry and start persecuting that group (from the Chinese to the Japanese to the Irish to the Germans to the Jews to the Eastern Europeans to the Mexicans) then it, who would've guessed it, turns out that they were alright afterwards. This is just another round of asshats complaining about foreigners that aren't going to do anything but add to the mixing pot that is the US.

Then why can't Trump refuse, by your logic, refugees from state sponsors of terrorism and terror-wracked countries for 90 days without outrage? What makes ""local politics"" more imperative than a risk of terrorism, however remote?

The US has major squabbles with Iran, Syria, Sudan, etc.. We've been sanctioning most of them, or have security threats from them. We have invaded Iraq twice in 25 years, intervened in Somalia, and attack/drone parts of Yemen regularly.

&gt;I think we've reached a bit of common ground here. So we agree it's a cost-benefit issue, but is the Arab ban justified on security grounds? Depends. Places like Lebanon good god yes. After a civil war, 20 years of occupation, a few massacres, and stalling of the peace process, it's not so much a ban as it is a case of a cold war.

Most of those countries you named are **right now** in a civil war, we occupy or have occupied some of them, and there have been both massacres and a lack of peace there in some cases for almost 15 years.

You're making my point for me.

&gt;Israel has had a long history of intelligence work in Arab countries. Even ones where peace is made between them. I mean, assassinations in EU countries against Arab citizens? Mossad agents killing Arabs in Dubai and Amman is well documented. Just a few years back the Irish were furious at the Mossad for faking Irish passports for assassinations abroad. Really, it is quite justified in many cases. However, it's not the main reason. Until peace is made, the Arab boycott will remain. I think this is just more incentive to make peace.

So the justification for Arab states is...Israeli actions in the EU? Assassinations in Amman, where Israelis can still enter, and a couple in Dubai? And that translates to banning Israel from Saudi Arabia, which has had no such incidents?

Absolutely not. Even if *some* areas were justified, that logic applies equally well to attempted attacks by Somalis.

&gt;Until peace is made, the Arab boycott will remain. I think this is just more incentive to make peace.

OK, then Trump can absolutely impose a boycott of those countries by your logic indefinitely, until they stop opposing US interests in such a way that we bomb half of them and the others are sanctioned by us already.

&gt;As far other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, I think it's just a case of standing in solidarity with the Palestinians. Of course, in some cases it's a tad hypocritical, but I can certainly understand why there'd be a boycott of Israel by some countries until some ground is reached with the Palestinians. So I agree that the security argument falls mute in many cases. But in some there is a lot of credible evidence. 

By your logic, the Arab ban Trump made is just as justified on security grounds. In fact, it's *more* justified. Israel assassinates Arab terrorists operating in Arab territory, while the people from countries Trump banned have tried to kill US *civilians* in  US territory. I mean, the distinction gets even stronger. Arab hypocrisy on the issue is monumental.",0,1,t1_dd73pvg,Israel,tayaravaknin,,0,t3_5r6l77,us,1485973977,

* PSD's leader Liviu Dragnea is already convicted of vote fraud, but due to some lapses in our laws he is still eligible for a seat in the parliament (along with a dozen other members of his party, convicted for various corruption charges)
* due to his conviction, Dragnea was ineligible for the role of Prime-Minister, but he installed someone from his party as his personal puppet (this of course is debatable as noone will openly admit to that, but in all the press conferences Dragnea calls the shots while the Prime-Minister just nods)
* one of the first things the new Prime-Minister and his Cabinet pushed for was to change the law concerning inmates (some of our jails are overpopulated and there are notes from the EU to do something about it) - that's because Dragnea already is accused in another trial of defrauding the state of €24,000 and the trial is on 14th February (there are quite a few changes to the law, each one affecting different politicians but the one concerning Dragnea is raising the bar for when you can be tried for abuse of power to more than €44,000 thus annulling the above trial)
* meanwhile the population knew what was going on and have held protests multiple days in many cities, totaling more than 100,000 people, also attended by our President who is against this law (and so are all the people in the judiciary system)
* so they passed a decree in the middle of the night, at about 10PM and then immediately published it at 1AM last night, that directly helps their boss, and many other high-profile politicians, that defrauded the state by more than €1 bn and the state will not be able to recoup those losses anymore
* there are again more than 100,000 people in the streets (80,000 in Bucharest and tens of thousands in a few other cities) protesting the law

* aside from the politicians that get to be released and the €1 bn lost, there's a higher risk, with €6.5 bn being budgeted this year for 'Regional Development' that can be defrauded without any fear because of the current law that decriminalizes (for a large part) the abuse of power of officials

I tried to be as objective as possible, the above are all facts but unfortunately I don't think there are other sources other than romanian ones that I can give

tl;dr Party in power passes law in the middle of the night that helps their boss and legalises (possible) future abuses of power and people (100,000), the President, and judiciary system protest in the streets

Is it as rampant and systematic as its sometimes portrayed (e.g. Russia/Jamaica) or is it more individual based? Have you ever witnessed a teammate or rival doping or ran against someone you know for sure is using something to enhance their performance?

[FansUnite](https://fansunite.com/profile/CBN180)


Well, the Houston spread definitely covered so I'll keep running and paying attention to that system in the future. The over failed but it'd be tough to predict that bad of an offensive performance from Sacramento.. Here's Wednesday's picks..


**Picks:**

**Atlanta ML (2.02) (2 Units)**

Wow, this is somewhat tough to do against a surging Miami team (8 in a row!?!?) but I don't see how Atlanta drops this one. Miami is super reliant on scoring in the paint and Atlanta boasts one of the best rim defenders in Dwight Howard and have players at other positions who deny their match-up from getting to the rim (Schroeder, Bazemore, Sefolosha and Millsap).. 

Key Stats:

- Miami is the 4th most reliant team in the NBA on points in the paint and Atlanta gives up the 2nd fewest PITP per 100 possessions (39.0)

- Atlanta is 9-4  SU against teams with 18 and 19 wins (similar win percentages).. I find this relevant because they tend to not drop games they shouldn't.. 

**Minnesota +7 (2 Units)**

Cleveland has been struggling and KAT should be a nightmare for them without K-Love.. Minnesota's bench is typically their weakness (least amount of points per game) but Cleveland's is currently 28th in bench scoring and that bench is even more thin now with the recent absence of Love and the older absence of J.R. Smith. Minnesota also has the 11th best three point defense and Tom Thibodeau coaching so I think they should do a good job on LeBron and co. defensively. 

Key Stats:

- Cleveland 2nd most reliant team on three ball (34.9% of points) and Minnesota is 11th best at defending it.

- Minnesota had won their last 4 ATS as dogs before going on a huge run of games (6) where they were favored.. They have struggled ATS as favorites but I believe this is a slight over-correction for a team that is finding their groove right now.


**OKC ML (1.65) (1 Unit)**

Goatbrook gonna eat against that poverty paint defense of the Bulls. Thunder are terrific at home and I can't see them dropping this one SU. The Bulls have allowed the last three point guards they have faced: McConnell of Philly, Schroeder of ATL and Dragic of Miami to go for 17, 24 and 26 respectively. Dragic's game is a similar rim-attacking style so I'm predicting Westbrook to go for **AT LEAST** 35 in this one on national TV and a heavier burden on him without Kanter. Going to hold at one unit though until we see OKC take care of business tip to buzzer without Kanter.


**Dallas -6.5 (1 Unit)**



**Milwaukee ML (3.73) (1 Unit)**

Utah has been struggling lately and Milwaukee is a hit or miss team. I think Giannis and Parker provide huge match-up issues in this one and the perimeter defense of Brogdon, Delly and Snell could be big in this one. Gobert does protect the rim well so that will be a challenge but I like the value of Milwaukee here as they have the talent to beat about anyone but suffer greatly with inconsistency. 


**May add a play on the LA-PHX game or Charlotte-GSW game but we'll see how things are looking**

1st add (730 PM CT) **Phoenix +2.5 (1 Unit)** - wishing I didn't play LA on my degen parlay.. Think Phoenix's guards will be way too much here and I don't see anyone on LA stopping them, especially when you look at their bench guys and the fact that Austin Rivers started at PG last game.. Not sure if Blake or DeAndre are going to be able to do enough here to take one on the road. Considered a 2 unit play, but going to stick with 1 since it's a late add. Cheer$. 


Also just added **Russell Westbrook over 29.5 points for 2 units** - not counted into an official record

t5_2rur5,1488477216,False,False,,dd78ggx,"18 Isaiah Hartenstein

Previous rank: No. 28

Germany
Age: 18

Forward

Hartenstein impressed scouts with a strong showing at the FIBA under-18 European championships, averaging 14.7 PPG, 9.5 RPG and 3.5 APG in around 25 MPG. Most NBA scouts said he was the second-best prospect there, after Ntilikina.

He's got that coveted combination of athleticism and size. He can score from anywhere on the floor, and he rebounds and defends well.

He can be a bit volatile and his game is still a major work in progress, but several scouts who went to the tournament came away feeling he could end up in the 13 to 20 range on draft night.
____

19 Jarrett Allen

Previous rank: No. 19

Texas
Freshman

Center

Allen is quietly putting together a strong season for Texas. He had the best game of his career against Kansas a couple of weeks ago, scoring 22 points, grabbing 19 rebounds and blocking three shots.

He can be inconsistent and turnover prone and he needs to work on his body, but scouts love his long-term potential. In a draft without a lot of great center prospects, he should crack the top 20.
____

20 Terrance Ferguson

Previous rank: No. 17

Australia
Age: 19

Guard

Ferguson isn't putting up big numbers in Australia, averaging just 5 PPG and shooting just 31 percent from 3 for Adelaide. However, scouts don't seem too discouraged by his lack of production.

He's getting meaningful minutes on a pro team and that seems to be enough to encourage most of the NBA scouts I spoke with, who have him projected as a mid-to-late first-round pick.
____

21 Zach Collins

Previous rank: N/A

Gonzaga
Freshman

Center

Collins has been moving up boards around the league thanks to a strong freshman season coming off the bench for the Zags.

He fits the definition of a model NBA 5. He's big and versatile, and he plays on the perimeter and finishes above the rim. He's also a good athlete who can guard both 4s and 5s.

He needs to add strength, but teams love his upside.
____

22 Tyler Lydon

Previous rank: No. 23

Syracuse
Sophomore

Forward

Athletic big men who can stretch the floor are the rage in the NBA and Lydon continues to hold steady in the early 20s thanks to terrific shooting and promising defensive abilities.

He's hitting 44 percent from 3 this season and averaging 8 RPG and 1.5 BPG. He lacks ideal strength to be an NBA 4, but he held his own against Florida State on Saturday with 14 points, 11 boards and six blocks.
____

23 Rodions Kurucs

Previous rank: No. 27

Latvia
Age: 18

Forward

Kurucs has moved into the starting lineup for FC Barcelona B, averaging 16 PPG and 4 RPG while shooting 41 percent from 3.

That combination of shooting, length and athleticism should get him drafted somewhere in the mid-to-late first now that his production has picked up.
____

24 John Collins

Previous rank: N/A

Wake Forest
Sophomore

Forward

Collins has been really strong in ACC play, averaging 23 PPG and 9 RPG while shooting a ridiculous 72 percent from the field.

While Collins is a sophomore, he's younger than some of the freshmen on our board. He won't turn 20 until late September
____

25 Andrew Jones

Previous rank: N/A

Texas
Freshman

Guard

Jones makes our top 30 for the first time after a string of strong performances in Big 12 play. He's coming off the bench, but he's arguably been Texas' most complete player lately, averaging 16 PPG, 5 RPG, 4 APG and 2 SPG and shooting 45 percent from 3 in his last five games.

He's an elite athlete who can play both the 1 and the 2 and he's been showing more consistency from 3-point range. He has all the physical tools scouts look for in a guard. While he still doesn't look ready for the NBA yet, the long-term potential is there.
____

26 Donovan Mitchell

Previous rank: N/A

Louisville
Sophomore

Guard

Mitchell is the biggest mover on our board. He's rocketed up the rankings after a series of big games in the ACC.

He just dropped 29 points on Pitt and followed it up with a 28-point performance against NC State on Saturday. In those two games he shot 12-for-20 from 3.

While he's a bit of a tweener, his elite athleticism and defensive abilities could make him a dangerous weapon coming off the bench in the NBA.
____
27 Edrice Adebayo

Previous rank: No. 18

Kentucky
Freshman

Forward

""Bam"" continues to be solid for Kentucky, but his draft stock has been slipping in recent weeks.

He's strong, bouncy and a fierce dunker. However, his inconsistency and so-so rebounding give scouts pause. One NBA exec compared him to Florida's [Patric Young](http://insider.espn.com/nbadraft/draft/tracker/player?draftyear=2010&amp;playerId=19566); he looks the part, but doesn't always play the part.
____

28 Luke Kennard

Previous rank: No. 30

Duke
Sophomore

Guard

Duke has been a major disappointment this year, but you can't say the same about Kennard. He's been Duke's most consistent scorer, a lethal 3-point shooter who has shown toughness and versatility.

In a draft without a lot of elite shooters, he should be able to crack the first round.
____
29 Marques Bolden

Previous rank: No. 20

Duke
Freshman

Center

Bolden's play has been disappointing, but the raw potential is there. When he gets minutes as he did against Miami, that talent really shines through.

While he's far from ready for the NBA, don't be surprised to see a team gamble on him late in the first round.
____
30 Tony Bradley

Previous rank: No. 22

UNC
Freshman

Center

Bradley plays a limited role off the bench at Carolina, but his length, rebounding ability and overall feel for the game make him a solid big man prospect for down the road.

He's another draft-and-stash (in the D-League) prospect.

""And Europe isn't complaining as much as we are. But this is more of a Europe problem,"" Trump continued. ""And when Europe comes to us and says, 'We want your help, we want your help,' but they're not really doing that. They're dealing with Russia, they're taking in the gas, they're taking in the oil — they're not really doing that. And you know, we're making a big deal out of it.""

""But why isn't Germany leading this one?"" Trump asked. ""You know Germany is a very rich, very powerful nation. Why aren't they dealing on it moreso? Everything the United States — we're like the policeman of the world.""

On Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO.

“I wouldn’t care. If [Ukraine] goes in, great. If it doesn’t go in, great,” Trump also said that Europe should bear the brunt of the responsibility for standing up to Russia in the Ukraine conflict.

“I don’t like what’s happening with Ukraine. But that’s really a problem that affects Europe a lot more than it affects us. And they should be leading some of this charge,” he said.

Trump accused Germany -- whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, has been a stinging critic of Russia in the conflict -- of “sitting back” and “accepting all the oil and gas that they can get from Russia” while the United States is “leading Ukraine.”

Reported August 16th, 2015



“My feeling toward the Ukraine and towards the entire area is very, very strong. I know many people that live in the Ukraine, they’re friends of mine, they’re fantastic people,” said Trump.

“We will make statements and I think those statements will be honoured,” he said of a putative Trump policy towards Ukraine. “The fact is that the Ukraine is an amazing place. These are people who know what’s right and they’re not being treated right.”

“Viktor I’ve known for a long time and he is a tremendous guy,” said Trump of the Ukrainian oligarch, who is married to the daughter of Ukraine’s former president, Leonid Kuchma. “When he was up seeing me I said I think I can learn more from you than you can learn from me.”

Most common trees are beech, spruce and oak.

We also have [larch forest] (http://www.solcavsko.info/knjiznica/les/gorski/macesen/velike/macesnov_gozd.jpg) on higher altitudes. [Inside] (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6VU_xQ4_yDQ/VCGJIx1iRKI/AAAAAAAAxno/T3HqCmXZE4M/s1600/DSC_1872%2Bpom.jpg).

In the karst area they look like [this] (http://www.gozd-les.com/novice/sprehod-skozi-gozd-november-2016). Most common trees are oak, black pine and chestnut. Also sumac tree.

Around Javornik and Snežnik, you'll find forests like [this] (http://www.slotrips.si/sis-mapa/skupina_doc/slo/galerija/1326833745_9979_img_0510.jpg) with european hop-hornbeam, Turkey oak and durmast oak.

Then there's Pokljuka forest with 97% spruce trees and a lot of bog.

1) I never mentioned Europe was a country. I'm very aware it isn't.  Perhaps there is a language barrier here? I'm guessing English isn't your first language.  

2) I didn't say they were similar, my point was that they are different. Again, probably the language barrier here.  

3) Did I say that everything America does is ahead of Europe? Wait, no, I didn't.  I was saying you don't like it when you aren't the first to do something, especially when it comes to **the field of consumer products and services**.  I did not say it happens every time, you just don't like it when it does happen, as evidenced by your need to assert your manhood about having some materials you may or may not have touched with your hands being in space.

4) Socialism is a form of economy.  There are governments that are socialist, but the form of government can be different, hence why I phrased it that way.  It's also why I was comparing it to a ""capitalist economy"" putting socialism and capitalism in the same category.  

5) I am much happier paying for my healthcare when I need it, rather than being forced to pay for everyone's healthcare out of my taxes without being able to opt out if I do not like it.  That's the point of charity.  I choose to donate 2k of my salary a year to St. Jude's because it's what I *want* to do, not because I am forced to.  It's a concept called freedom.

At that point, it becomes a ""your word against mine"" argument, which is useless to get into.

But, to respond anyway, it's clear the guy doesn't live in Germany. I personally live in Denmark, have many friends who are germans, family that lives in the Netherlands and family living in Britain. There is no rampant muslim problem in Europe, despite American sources trying to portray it as such.

But since we can be sure that your friend is going to try and negate that and claim there is anyway, you can argue with his logic from a logical perspective. If we are to ban any great threat to national security, the first thing that should be cracked down upon is far-right, white extremism, as [this study](https://www.splcenter.org/20150212/lone-wolf-report) shows. Assuming he specifically means immigration of muslims, and thereby laying the fault with Islam as a religion or islamic cultures in general, his line of thinking would then have us ban all muslims. That would remove [20.000 or about 10% of all doctors](http://www.muslimlinkpaper.com/myjumla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1440:Muslim%20Doctors%20Abundant,%20But%20Muslim%20Hospitals%20Non-Existent&amp;Itemid=17) from the United States.

Some of the most transparent, responsible and biggest charities in the US(and the world) are [muslim charities.](http://www.hhrd.org/aboutus)

I can go on and on. Essentially, you can tell your friend he is being manipulated by a media with an agenda to push. His logic will always be flawed if his basic premises are flawed. This is why, to evaluate any claim, you have to research the premises and evidences put forward. Think of it this way: Using perfect logic, you could argue Vatican city has 2.3 popes per square kilometer, since Vatican City is 0.44 square kilometers big. This logic, on the other hand, does not reflect reality because it ignores the fact that there can only ever be 1 pope.

t5_2qhnn,1488478956,False,False,,dd7bf6n,"So to answer OP's question first, yes. Basically every government since democracy was established in Bulgaria was/is under some Russian influence, which if you know the history of the region is not surprising. What follows is very simplistic explanation of what happened during that period of ~25 years.

* The former [Bulgarian Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Communist_Party) (Българска Комунистическа Партия - БKП) renamed to [Bulgarian Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Socialist_Party) (Българска Социалистическа Партия - БСП) and was/is always leaning towards Russia. This is a party made of mostly old BCP members, former agents of National Security and generally people who were closer to the elite in the years of the Cold War. During the 90's people in power privatized like hell everything from factories to power plants, refineries, mines, big state companies etc. Pretty much everything they could get. People who yesterday were close to the ruling cast were now millionaires because of those deals. Some of those assets were sold to western companies (including American), others to Russian. This is also the time when the mafia really showed its head for the first time. The interesting thing about the Bulgarian Mafia is that every big holding had it's connections to people in power. The government itself worked with those people to ruin the country economically for their personal benefit. Forests and prime real estate were sold to questionable people from the state for nearly nothing. Arms trading directly from the army was taking place. Drug dealing, insurance fraud, you name it people from BCP and their friends were involved.

* Another very interesting creature is the [Movement for Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms) . In Bulgaria we have an ethnic Turkish and Muslim minorities. They vote for MRF every time like clockwork. The party's creator and leader (not publicly since he resigned a couple of years back) is [Ahmed Dogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Dogan), an agent of National Security. He's a suspect for the terrorist attack on [railway station Bunovo](http://archive.worldhistoria.com/tukrish-terrorist-acts-in-bulgaria-in-80s_topic20055_page1.html). He's a controversial figure in Bulgarian politics since if you follow the constitution an ethnic party is forbidden to even exist (although there are ethnic Bulgarians in the party). He has close ties with Russia historically and nowadays very close with Erdogan. Very rich and only speculation for where he got his money. Everytime BSP has been in power for the last 20 years, they were in coalition with MRF because of their stable electorate.

* A party that had limited life was the [National Movement for Stability and Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Movement_for_Stability_and_Progress) led by tsar Simeon II that abdicated and flew the country during the Communist coupe in 1945. He was the new face in Bulgarian politics at the time. He won the elections, became PM and uttered his famous quote that he'll fix Bulgaria for 800 days. He didn't fix anything. Shady deals with his private properties like castles, former residencies and forests (he basically took them back). He was instrumental in the government that was called [The Three-Party-Coalition-Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanishev_Government). The only good things that came from this period is Bulgaria joining NATO (2004) and joining EU (2007). 

* Now here comes [GERB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB) the so called anti-communist fighters in Bulgarian politics. A lot can be said about the leader and soon to be 3 times PM - [Boyko Borisov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyko_Borisov). Former agent of National Security, bodyguard of the last dictator [Todor Zhivkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov), alleged ties with organized crime and the list can go on, and on and on. They smashed BSP to pieces, won every major regional and state elections since Stanishev's Government (who resigned and became chairman of PES).

The people were fed up. The ugly truth is that GERB is the other side of the coin. On one hand you have seemingly pro-west government, but behind the scenes is a clustefuck. Boyko Borisov is a leader that changes his mind daily and twice on Sunday if there's even a whiff from disagreement from USA, EU or Russia. He wants what we Bulgarians call: ""Хем вълкът сит, хем агнето цяло"" - It can't be, that the wolf is full, and the lamb is alive. He wants to please everybody, but mostly the people in power close to him. 

And now we come to the second-to-last presidential elections. Our last president was very anti-Russia since the Ukranian conflict started. [Rosen Plevneliev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosen_Plevneliev) was GERB's candidate. He won and all was well for a while. After he started with his aggressive anti-Russia rhetoric, GERB withdrew support from him and the president was left alone in his fight.

He fought till the end, when Boyko Borisov in his simplistic attitude didn't offer a presidential candidate up until the deadline and he chose the only candidate that didn't have any chance to win - Tsetska Tsacheva. This in my mind was done because the only viable candidates were mayors of major Bulgarian cities, and he didn't want to lose them. By that time BSP had Rumen Radev, who seemingly is not a pro-Russian candidate, but his actions and demeanor speak otherwise (he flew to Brussels on his first official visit on a military Spartan aircraft, the reasons given were fuel economy). 

Right now BSP think that since they've won elections for the first time against GERB they'll be in power again. They're lying to themselves. The only reason Radev won was because of the penalty vote that the electorate gave GERB and Boyko because he chose Tsacheva as GERB's candidate. BSP will be slapped hard in the upcoming elections.

You have to understand that right now there's a battle for the soul of Bulgarians, pro-West and pro-Russia. Rusophiles and Rusophobes. Pro-EU, anti-EU. People who want change and people who want things to stay the same. I'd be wrong to say that things haven't improved over the years. They have. But it's a slow process.

This isn't a feel good, kumbayah sentiment.  It is a cold, hard, biological fact. 

Proponents of ""race"" usually mean ""whites,"" ""blacks,"" ""yellows,"" etc, or ""Europeans,"" Africans,"" ""Asians."" 

But these are completely nonsense categorizations.  Because at the *genetic level*, there are *more genetic differences between some populations of white-skinned individuals than between white and black skinned individuals*. 

And the genetic differences are small, extremely small.  Essentially irrelevent in terms of trying to sub-categorize humans. 

You have *homo Sapiens*, that's us, and that's it.  Within our species, we see normal levels of variation.  Some people have red hair.  Some are really tall.  But *none* of those variations imply we are a different *race* than one another. 

Take a bunch of tall people and mate them together for 800 years.  Take a bunch of short people and do the same. 

What you'll end up with, in all likelihood, is one set of super tall people, and one set of super short people. 

But unless you've selected for some other variable, that will be the extent of their difference.  They'll still be the same species, and not two different ""races"".  And in all likelihood, they'll each have a certain amount of tall or short people. 

And so it is with skin color.  It signifies absolutely nothing biologically relevant except how much melanin they have.  White and black individuals are often more genetically different from *other* white and black individuals than they are from one another, and again, even those differences are small as to be essentially irrelevant.",0,17,t3_5rhmh3,explainlikeimfive,ninemiletree,,0,t3_5rhmh3,,1485979076,

At the European level, I believe there are two major systemic problems, and one which was how the crisis was managed.

The first problem is the demographic problem. Europe's aging population is contributing to the slowdown of growth rates as more people retire and less people enter into the workforce.

The second problem is more fixable. The eurozone is not a optimal currency area. Mobility from one nation to another is very low because of differences in language, and since it's not a fiscal union, it means that a single monetary policy won't work for every country. This dynamic hurts the periphery, and since there are no fiscal transfers between richer and poorer countries, many of the latter keep diverging from the European average (as is the case with Portugal since the crisis).

The third more circumstantial problem which is specific to the Great Recession is that the European Union failed to act rapidly. The ECB doesn't have the power of the Federal Reserve, but even then it still could have done much more than it did, as evidenced by Mario Draghi's current, much more active, leadership.

On to Portugal.

In Portugal, the demographic problem is exacerbated because of even lower child birth rates than in most of Europe, and because of brain drain. Over the last years, even though Portugal has invested a lot of resources into educating its population, it hasn't been very beneficial to the economy because many graduates move abroad to find jobs.

On top of these long term hindrances, we have short term obstacles. Portugal's public and private debt is very high, which means the government can't afford (literally can't afford) to pump money into the economy, or else interest on our debt will skyrocket, which may lead to another bailout. Our financial system is also not very stable, and there are no good solutions to the current problems within it (in my opinion that is; the extreme left, for example, wants to nationalize all the banks).

In my opinion, there's a final way in which the Portuguese economy is in a bad shape. The lack of labor market flexibility in Portugal, while good for the people who get to keep their jobs, is ultimately bad for all because it reduces investment opportunities and reduces Portugal's international competitiveness, which in turn leads to higher unemployment and less economic activity.

Unfortunately, I think the current government is only making the situation worse. While I don't have a problem with the rate at which it is willing to reduce the deficit (a lesser rate than the last government), this, combined with the increased minimum wage (an increase of roughly 20% over 4 years if the government lasts), a recent increase of the gas tax, among other things, will lead to worse economic growth in the medium and long run.",0,21,t3_5rdr2g,PoliticalDiscussion,lxpnh98_2,,0,t3_5rdr2g,,1485979152,

&gt; Sam hasn't argued (much?) that Islam would create these militias and Christianity wouldn't.

No. Haven't you ever heard Sam say, ""Islamic fundamentalism is only a problem because of the fundamentals of Islam."" Sam argues ad nauseam that there is a special problem with the ideology in Islam and the Quran that explains why you have suicide bombings. Have you ever heard him argue that if you left a a group of people with the Quran and came back 1000 years later and found a group similar to ISIS it wouldn't be surprising? Sam could not be more clear on this. I don't know how you could argue he sees Islam anywhere near Christianity in terms of doctrine and the example set forth by Mohammad as compared to Jesus - who he likens to a hippie vs a conquering warlord.

And Hamas has nothing to do with US foreign policy. They have a palpable hatred of Jews. The day after Israel was created, the Muslim nations surrounding the newly formed democracy declared war on them. And surely you know that terrorism is not anywhere near the whole story with regards to Islam and its history. Terrorism is merely a modern tool used by jihadists. But jihadism is as old as Islam itself. Mohammed was a conquering warlord be-header of human beings. The Quran lays out a clear doctrine of jihad: Spread the faith by the sword. There have been Islamic invasions of Europe for centuries. The crusades were a direct response to Islamic jihads carried into Europe.

There is no similar doctrine of jihad in Christianity. Christianity has a bloody history, but that is not the example set forth by Jesus. The church sought to exert power of people by enforcing its morality over the populations it ruled. There is, however, no doctrine in Christianity that calls for its adherents to spread the faith but he sword.

t5_2qh13,1488479645,False,False,,dd7cjse,"&gt;First of that means the solution to the problem of Trump is; hopefully something bad happens. I'm not a problem solver but this ""solution"" starts to look bad from the start.

It's not a solution. It's cause and effect. 

&gt;, lets say he does ""bomb and america is in the shitter"". Apparently that has fixed the issue of ""people like him having another shot"" but at what cost, you now have a much bigger problem to deal with, America is in the shitter

If we can turn course in 4 years, and keep people like him out (conflicts of interest, bullying other countries,  EOs that hurt people, and that less than 2 weeks in), we can end up learning from our mistakes and be better off. If he skates thru, then the next trump could be worse  (if that's possible). If we end up in the shitter, that probably means recession (hopefully not war). We can overcome that. 

Note that even though I didn't vote trump, I was hopeful just two weeks ago. Now I just hope we don't end up in a war or worse. 

&gt;Also you are counting on the fact that american people will learn the lesson, this doesn't seem as clear to me as I can't see a proper mechanism to ensure it. For example, how much was learned from 2008?

Valid point. But I think this is different. People voted for Bush like any other candidate. People voted trump out of fear and jingoism. Also as a middle finger to the system  (which is ironic now that his staff is largely the same people they were giving the finger to). Others voted for a single issue like the Supreme Court or pro life or guns. Maybe they will learn to vote for a better leader across the spectrum if his policies hit home negatively for his supporters. 

&gt;Again, IF he bombs, right? If he doesn't will it really matter if people like him have a go? What if he does a bad job, but it is nowhere near a disaster meaning the voters don't learn any ""lesson""? Would that mean 60+ years of people like trump; people with only business experience, valuing profit above all else? 

Well he's off to a good start (at bombing). Even Europe sees him as a threat. He is already creating global instability, is already a great tool for terrorist recruitment and is ready to throw out NAFTA with the bathwater and is about to really hit us hard if he adds huge tariffs for other counties. 

If we end up in the shitter, it's not because of discussionsome like this thread. It's because he's a bad president. I would loveto eat my words. But it really is getting out of hand, fast. His value of profit might work in the private sector,  but it doesn't work for foreign policy. The US isn't a business. You cant just disrespect everyone at this level. A negotiation with Mexico is vastly different than one with contractors. You can't just win, foreign policy is all about compromise. 

&gt;How does that compare with an America in the shitter? 

If he doesn't put us there, and somehow gains international goodwill (at this point I don't see how that's possible) and does well,  great. I want America to succeed. But if he doesn't do that and the economy flounders and americans lose jobs and money (or worse war), I just hope it's enough to wake people up. He's enough of a spectacle to do just that. 

So in conclusion,  I, nor op (as far as I can tell) do not want America in the shitter. But in the long term we need to learn. If he takes us down the shit hole, we need to wake up to the fact that starting with the primaries,  he was directing misplaced anger into votes. Maybe the Bush years plus the trump years will be enough to wake people up. 

The Boeing deal with Iran and Iraq, if lost, will lose 10,000 American jobs. If he keeps his pace up, it could be a long 4 years. If people are effected personally,  they may get the picture.

The whole point is to prevent another populist candidate who pushes policies that don't make sense but fire up people on the name of fear and racism  (or jingoism). Like his wall for instance. It's not going to keep anyone out. Since visa abuse is the leading cause of illegal immigration,  it's really going to do nothing. Other than alienate us from our ally, Mexico. The travel ban is just going to make Americans less safe and create animosity towards us. 

I would rather be in the shitter temporarily than a slow burn that is inescapable. 

I guess I'm rambling. But so far it's been bad. I am literally embarrassed by my government. Never have it seen anything like this. The rest of the world isn't going to put up with him for very long. That's only going to hurt everyday Americans. Friends are better than enemies. Especially when there's nuclear weapons in the mix.

But if you ever compared training matches and league matches in Soccer or other sports who exist way longer than league, you see that even there the differences between a training match and an actual league match are very clear in terms of player movement, how they go into tackles, how they fight for the ball, how they follow the tactics the trainer wants to play...

There's almost no need to challenge your argument ... it's **self**-contradictory. 

Germany is economically energetic but not (at least not *militarily*) that powerful. France for example, if only due to falling for it once (WWI) and twice (WWII) went for its own independent nuclear arsenal and could if it so wished wipe the whole of Germany off the map in a matter of minutes. And regardless of whether Trump (of Winnie-the-Pooh for that matter) is at the helm, the USA is itself the most militarised and weaponised country in the world and this by very far. And NATO is a US-led and US-controlled body furthermore. And your argument is basically that Merkel will *stand up* to the US because (since '*they are wary of Russia's Putin*' etc.) Germany ... *needs* the US?

Because if you're going to live somewhere abroad for more than three months, it is fairer towards local telecom companies to get their phone cards than chugging off the local telecom infrastructure without paying them for it. It's an extremely good compromise between consumer protection and preventing abuse of local telecom infrastructure.

&gt; Why not have Europe-wide competition between the companies?

You already have Europe-wide competition between companies. It is one of the economic areas where there is the most competition and inter-European investment.

There is no European legislation preventing an European telecom company from spreading across multiple European countries, like British Vodafone or German T-Mobile have done, for instance.

t5_2ryq7,1488480095,False,False,,dd7dc32,"For any Americans now curious about how the European ""pyramids"" work in sports. I highly recommend, if you ever make the pilgrimage to watch some top football, that you also check out a couple matches from the lower leagues. 

Having skirted the lines of pro here in the states, playing college, PDL, and some USL before calling it quits, I've always been curious where I would have fit in over in Europe. I got to go to the Europa game in Dortmund last year (friend lives in Koln). While there, I watched Koln vs Bayern, Viktoria (3rd division), the Koln woman's team, and some Koln youth academy training and games.

Americans really can't fathom the way European clubs operate, and it's what holds us back from competing. Their pro sides are not just businesses, but take responsibility for the grassroots football in their respective neighborhoods (not sure if England is the same, but I believe they are). This way, no matter where you live, if you're playing in your neighborhood league, you're within the intricate web of pro-football.

For instance, my friend from Koln that I visited plays American football. His team trains at the same complex as the Koln academy and women's team. While watching one of his practices, there was a 6th division (pub league), and a senior (old dudes) match which I was told falls somewhere way down the pyramid itself. Meanwhile, a rec game of 12 year olds was going on right next to the u10 girls academy training. I spoke to the girls coach a bit, fascinated at how talented they are, and she was telling me that the rec league right next to us is supervised by the academy staff. At the end of every season, they pick off the top individuals to plug them into the higher levels. 

Even though I was at a Bundesliga club like FC Koln, the smaller Viktoria out in the burbs works the same way in a smaller area. My friend is roommates with their reserve keeper, and he played his way up from childhood simply by performing and getting promoted within the club. The reason a club like Wycombe still has so many fans is because it's not just another team, it's THEIR neighborhood, the club that provided them football growing up. Imagine the way our major cities have pride for their NFL teams, except EVERY town and neighborhood had their own that was fighting to earn some more status among the rest. It's magical, really.

It's an incredible world within sport that they've built over the last century+. Since returning, I've already started transitioning our youth club into a similar structure and everyone's loving it. I hope US soccer takes some initiative soon to start adding more structure to our national youth, because it's the reason we have so many talented players fall through the cracks. Ours is still pay-to-play, and it's way too difficult to work your way up without your parents having either stacks of cash or connections within the sport.

t5_2qh0u,1488480103,False,False,,dd7dcob,"So I am a European *and* British *and* Scottish. I voted for Brexit so I think it's only fair to say that. I admire Farage's ability despite not voting for him (I feel the same way about Sturgeon too). 

So there is quite a lot going on here that I, personally am interested in.

Firstly (and probably most important and relevant) MEP's are elected. The people who work in the commission are not. They are civil servants. They write the legislation and then MEP's vote or veto on it. The point that seems to be being made in direct regards to the UK is that we often vote differently to other MEP's and therefor our votes 'don't count'. That's how I understand it. 

Other things I think are very interesting in this video:

- that Farage is still going to the EU and antagonising them. Why is he still there? He loves it! He is most likely attempting to destabilise confidence in the EU as an institution and as a Parliment. 

- the EU is very unhappy about Trump's election. There are currently several right wing politicians gaining traction. Most current is Marine Le Pen who is the right wing candidate for France. She wants to have a Frexit and reinstate the Franc. The EU don't want to see populism spread. 

- Seb Dance holding the sign behind Farage. People criticise Farage for being a bully and disrespectful to other MEP's and commissioners (last year he told many of his collegues that they had 'never worked a day in their life'). But this sort of thing is really disappointing to see. It's worse than either the behaviour in the Commons or in Hollyrood (Scottish Government). It also shows how upset more central politicians get with populists, I don't think this is the way to debate it successfully. 

- it also appears right underneath the main story on www.bbc.co.uk/news The main story being UK Parliment have backed Theresa May enacting Article 50. I don't think they should be so close together because I don't think the events are connected directly.

The rules say you can't have excessive macroeconomic imbalances. Those aren't judged by the scoreboard (current account balance/trade surplus), but by looking at a number of factors. You've quoted that yourself (""warning signs""), what on earth are you on about?

Germany was among 7 countries deemed to have an 'imbalance', but not among 6 other countries deemed to have an 'excessive imbalance'.

I agree, ""it's taught badly"" is a poor statement - what I more refer to is the structure of the curriculum on a year-by-year basis, obviously not the individual instruction given to students. And this is not to be construed as contempt of, or ""cultural cringe"" towards the language. I want Irish to work, but so far it clearly hasn't.

I am not a primary school teacher, or any teacher for that matter, so I can't say I know the terminology of what is done very well. I do remember in primary school going through an aimsir chaite *year after year*, from 3rd-6th class, seemingly without progress. We were doing things like knowing when to use orm or ort or aici or agam or whatever, but only in artificial constructed sentences of líon na bearnaí, with no actual context.

There was such a little emphasis or impetus towards the spoken language. My vocabulary wasn't that bad, but putting really basic day-to-day sentences together like we'd use in English was tricky. Sure, you could say by-the-book things that were grammatically correct, but there was no life to it. There was no element of conversation. It was like it was being recited.

Of course not everyone had the same experience, but all I can do with myself is compare the standard of my spoken European language that I learned for 6 years, to spoken Irish which I did for 14.

Those restrictions on free speech are kinda paradoxical to a free society, but they're actually meant to uphold the Basic Law's first 19 articles - those 19 articles are the German equivalent of the Bill of Rights.
  
The idea is that any speech that goes against those rights (freedom of conscience, freedom of worship, equality before the law and so on) seeks to abolish those rights and thus must be opposed by force of the constitution.  

The bar is for banning certain forms of speech or anti-constitutional political parties is quite high, and the Constitutional Court (like the American Supreme Court, but MUCH less politicised) has in the last years struck down several attempts to ban expressions of (unpalatable) opinion and activism because the government and/or parliament  as plaintiffs were unable to prove that those activities - of the neo-Nazi NPD party - posed a direct/imminent threat to the constitution.

&gt;**Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany**

&gt;*Preamble*

&gt;Conscious of their responsibility before God and man,

&gt;Inspired by the determination to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united Europe, the German people, in the exercise of their constituent power, have adopted this Basic Law. [...]

&gt;*Article 1*

&gt;(1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.

&gt;(2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.

&gt;(3) The following basic rights shall bind the legislature, the executive and the judiciary as directly applicable law.

So, to answer your question: I'm happy with the (imo sensible) restrictions. As to firearms: if you want to own a firearm in Germany, you can.

Perhaps, I thought you meant the leverage we had whilst still inside the union. I'd agree that the government could have done a better job in these brexit proceedings but I'm still optimistic. If the EU is too spiteful they will be biting their nose to spite their face.

&gt; And yet historically, if we go back far enough in western history, pink was a color for boys. Red is a traditionally masculine color (you can google images of European kings and notice that their capes are red, this is because red as a color used to symbolize courage and bravery), and pink was seen as a lighter red, leading the western world to assume it was for boys. Fast forward to the early 1900s, all babies wore white dresses. Fast forward about 3 decades and boys wore pink dresses, girls wore blue dresses. Fast forward a few more decades and the colors switch and we get the now familiar boys blue, girls pink, boys pants, girls skirt equation.

The idea of any colors being gendered at all is a new one - if you look at books of hours, portraits, etc. from the Middle Ages and Renaissance, red is not restricted to men, but appears just as often on women. True red was an expensive color and thus a status symbol (madder required a high concentration to get a proper red; kermes and cochineal were very expensive dyestuffs but more reliably turned fabric really red), like black.

Infants in white was the default since much earlier than 1900 - I don't have *Pink and Blue* on me right now, and my own expertise trails off when you go before 1650 or so, but it's more useful to think of that as the standard than a different system of gendering infants and small toddlers. After certain twists and turns in the progress of gendering small boys' clothes in the 19th century, from skeleton suits to tunics to Little Lord Fauntleroy (intriguingly, early gendering focused more on differentiating boys' clothing from the default than in developing specifically masculine and feminine forms), the issue of gendered color started to come up after the turn of the century. Rather than pink being for boys and blue for girls across the board, though, as some online sources have put it, trade journals for infant clothing and books/ads aimed at parents didn't agree. You can find one to justify any standard you like, because it was a new concept to use colors for gender rather than to match complexion (and again intriguingly, the complexion-matching tended to be pink for brunettes and blue for blondes, which is IME the opposite of the current preference). By the 1930s, dresses were becoming restricted to girls and infants - the romper had been introduced around 1910 and was quickly very popular. The whole bifurcated vs. skirts issue was the main way of gendering in the early 20th century until the Baby Boom, and the total association of pink with traditional femininity didn't happen until the late 1970s and 1980s, in reaction to the ~decade of ""unisex"" child dressing before it.",0,2,t1_dd4w1q5,AskFeminists,chocolatepot,,0,t3_5r6490,af,1485983100,

Because The Gaulle always knew the only interest the UK had in the EU was an economical pact and that it would sabotage any political raprochement. It has always been the goal to form a more coherent European Poltical union, always. You can see the evidence all along it's path. They even where planning a European Army in 1956.

In fact the very first Union to speak of was the union of coal and steel the two most vital things needed to build up an arms industry followed by euro atom, another element in arms development at the time. It's been about making a europe not focused on its own internal struggles but an outward looking, political and military union. Something that would give downing street nightmares.
  
I am completely aware how the EU works, it's not complicated at all. At every step of the way there are checks and balances. It's more democratic then let's say May being head of state (who elected her?).  Or Boris Johnson being  foreign minister (who vetted him?, elected him? Or dared question him?).  

You are spreading thinly veiled disinformation that is blatantly wrong. Never did the Commission impose anything. The most powerful institution in the EU is still the Council which is comprised out of the national governements of all EU members. Power lies in the people, it's up to them to be informed. Many don't know the names of their own ministers, that doesn't mean those governments are not democraticly elected. In fact laws by the commission are held up through the European parliament (directly elected officials) and the commission can only act on those themes the council (sovereign national governments) agreed to cede power on. Additionally the commission doesn't institute laws, it ask it's member countries to enact the agreed upon stipulations in their national laws in their national parliament; another check and balance.

I personally am glad that the English chose Brexit, it will make sure the EU can forge ahead on several themes the English have always blocked. EU army (start), EU political and economical deepening. Trump getting elected only strengthened that.  I personally hope that the UK will brake apart when Scotland chooses to remain in the EU as a fully fledged member. An outlook that is far more likely then the EU falling apart because of the loss of one member known for it's EU-scepticism that is already wildly flailing in it's negotiations.

You will find it hard to convince me, I hold a master in International European politics and one of Modern History and I have worked for the EU. I actually know what I am talking about. I don't do talking points but go to the facts and original treaties, commission reports, white papers etc. The EU is one of the if not the best institution on the face of the earth and has helped EU rise from the fires of WWII, The Cold War and now it bring propserity to 400 million free western citizens all integrated into one free market, aiming to be the biggest one in the world.

I get it that you disagree and I understand the *potential* that the EU has to someday be extremely beneficial, but I wish you and people who think like you would try to see my side of this without just dismissing it as aimless fear mongering by racist alt-right nationalists the way the media has.

He has a tendency to do delusional things such as

He basically bans literally everyone who doesn't agree with him, and he ask people what is their ideology, to which no one answers. When people decided to troll him, he deleted all the comments, so you see an empty echo chamber.

t5_2qh0u,1488481591,False,False,,dd7fz29,"&gt; Nigel 'backtracks' on extra £350 million NHS funding. MEP Nigel Farage stated during the Brexit campaign the £350 million the U.K. allocates to the EU on an annual basis would be instead used to provide a larger cushion to the NHS. Yet within the hour of the results of the Brexit vote, Farage backtracked his promise.

What is the source for this statement? Because it is a complete lie, like an actual disgusting undeniable lie. He never ever said such a thing, and he certainly never made a ""promise"". If I were him I would have sued for this.

Also, it doesn't matter if you link me to 5 different leftist propaganda websites, that's not ""multiple sources"" I'm afraid. They all use the same source, and put on the same spin as well.

&gt; When I say backtrack I mean breaking a political promise or lying during his campaign to the people of the United Kingdom.

But he never made any such promise, and he never lie durign or after the campaign. I don't know what to tell you, you were simply lied to by the media. If you actually examined the evidence for yourself, that's presented right in front of you, you would be able to see this for yourself. 

So let me break this down: First of all, Nigel Farage was not a part of the ""Vote Leave"" campaign which made the infamous statement on the bus, so he can't possibly be held responsible for that. Then the lying press says that he himself said the same thing on BBC. Here's what he said, and I'm quoting your own sources here:

&gt; When quizzed by an audience member on whether the money would be invested in the NHS, Mr Farage reinforced his point.
He said: ‘Do you know what I’d like to do with the £10 billion? I’d like that £10 billion to be spent helping the communities in Britain that the government damaged so badly by opening up the doors to former communist countries.
‘What people need here is schools, hospitals, GPs, that’s what they need.’

So what he said was, that he would like for this money to be invested in infrastructure in the United Kingdom. How is that a fucking *lie*? That's completely absurd, it's an opinion, it can't possibly under any circumstance be a lie.",0,-1,t1_dd7eymi,pics,Krasivij,,0,t3_5rg4bn,,1485983881,

But something good from this might come, we will probably have to go crawling back in time/ this will result in no special exemptions and becoming a partner and really being a force for good in Europe.

Hollywood pretends to be an entertainment industry, but leftist ideology permeates it. The NYT, WaPo, NPR, and PBS all pretend to be high quality objective journalists and they are anything but.

t5_2v0m0,1488482207,False,1485985232,,dd7h1qd,"Also a **HUGE** Subaru fan here that also work for Subaru. 

I will split this into a few sections:

1.) How Subaru is different from other manufacturers

2.) Why Subaru has the best community (Also, one of the largest automotive based sub-reddits.)

3.) Why you should get a Subaru right now

4.) Why I think Subaru is the best

**1.)** Subaru has a strong history when it comes to [safety features](http://www.subaru.com/safety). There are many posts on [/r/Subaru](https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/) that show how crazy strong Subaru's chassis/bodys are. From flipped cars, to regular fender benders, these cars can take a beating. Subaru even has an advertising slogan, ""They Lived."" 

MPG wise, Subaru has made a great improvements on their engines to achieve good MPG ratings while maintaining an ACTIVE All-Wheel Drive system.
Speaking of AWD, Subaru's is one of the best on the market. To put it into perspective, Subaru is the best selling car in Colorado, and I believe Washington State. It is because with winter tires, you have a great amount of traction. With the right driver and tires in place, you can go to a LOT of places in a Subaru. However, please do note that driver experience and tire selection is MUCH more important than drive train selection.

Subaru is also known for its [Flat, or Horizontally Opposed Engines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine#Subaru) These engines provide a **lower center of gravity**, offering you the best handling that a road going car could offer. Subaru and Porsche are the only two automotive manufacturers that currently sell Boxer engines. 

Subaru is also one of the few manufacturers that essentially sell you what they race. The Subaru WRX and [Subaru Rally Team USA's Rally](http://www.subaru.com/enthusiasts/rally.html) car has all the same fundamentals. AWD, turbo, a good standard transmission, and stable/stiff chassis/suspension. Other rally cars are FWD cars made to be AWD to compete in things like Red Bull's GRC. Subaru isn't winning all of the championships/podium spots, but seeing how I can go into Group N rally racing with a few upgrades, and actually compete, makes me feel happy.

**2.)** Subaru's community is pretty cool. You have people that have grip time-attack cars, RWD conversion drift cars, lifted OEM rally cars, regular grocery getter, lowered for showroom use, and people who don't drive at all and simply own a Subaru museum/vintage car (There is currently a 100% OEM 2002 Subaru WRX Wagon with 43,000 miles 200 feet away from me..) There are tons of different people in the Subaru community, and I am sure you will feel welcomed when you post on over at /r/Subaru!

Subaru is awesome, because every model works well. (The Subaru Tribeca (lookswise) is a glitch in the matrix. However, its engine is pretty awesome.) From the Brat, to the STI, Subaru does one thing well, and it is that most models/trims are sought after. Unlike some car companies that have one cool model, Subaru gives its love to all.

**3.)** Subaru has a great re-sale value. Kelly Blue Book recently gave Subaru a few awards for having some of the best re-selling vehicles on the market. In other words, you should buy one now. Sell it in the future for a good amount of money for your next Subaru. [Or you can give your old Subaru to your future kid!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAOlksUlmAQ) Subaru has the best commercials as well.

**4.)** Obviously a 100% biased opinion, so I say OVERALL that the Outback is simply the better choice due to its interior space, All-Wheel Drive, and community. The boxer engine is pretty easy to work on, and is one of the few key components as to why Subaru stands out. The only real pain in the ass I have had, would have to be the spark plugs. They aren't terrible to get to, you may need a good amount of time your first time. 

Depending on where you're from, the new Outbacks do come in Diesel in the European, Australian, and -I believe- Japanese markets. You may want to consider Diesel. It's cool, and you should get it if you can. Then send it to me.

I say get the Outback, lift it, and put on 15"" wheels with some meaty tires. Bash bars/bull bar doesn't hurt either. I promise you, this Subaru may get you heavily into off-roading/cross country driving, so be aware of you're bank account. You may not understand a lot of this until about 1-2 weeks of ownership. Then people tend to want to do stuff to their Subaru.

Overall, you will not be making a mistake when you purchase a Subaru. With the Outback, you can do the long distance driving, the off-roading, and the grocery store pickups with a smile on your face every single time.

Reddit is (was?) effectively paying for server space so Nazis can recruit more people and expand their ranks. 

I get the angst against censorship, but when your ""beliefs"" are that Jews and black people are inferior races and should be disposed of, you shouldn't be welcome on a site that brands itself as a site welcoming to all people.

And here's proof of nazis using reddit to recruit nazis,  from The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website:
&gt; 

&gt; However, for White Nationalists, the really great thing about Reddit is that it provides quite a lot of fertile ground for recruiting young people into the pro-White movement. Reddit has a strong reputation for being a far-left SJW hugbox and it’s frequently mentioned in the same breath as Tumblr. However, many areas of Reddit are much more open to our ideas than you might think....
&gt; Go on European-dominated subreddits and drop subtle redpills. Don’t use “gas the kikes, race war now”-type rhetoric, obviously. If you must, say “Zionists” rather than “Jews.” Use their hatred of Israel and turn it into hatred of Jewry. Be subtle, be smart, and be persuasive.

&gt; We brought 4chan over to our side long ago. Now, we need to focus on redpilling Reddit – then, soon enough, every other major website. The Internet is our most important tool in the struggle against the Jewish parasite, hence why so many of the filthy nation-wreckers want governments to filter it. Use the Internet wisely, brothers. It is a very potent weapon.

&gt; Once we succeed at making our ideas mainstream on the Internet – thus winning over the hearts and minds of the youth – it’s game over for international Jewry.

Funnily enough, looks like the only thing it's ""game over"" for now is blatant naziism on Reddit.

Yes, a parliament is very disturbing.  To everyone who doesn't know how a parliament works. 


&gt;Europe has existed before the EU and exists now and will exist after the EU

As warring nationstates.  


&gt;There are a lot of article that discusses that from an economic perspective.

Fortune...

""Socialist Europe"" 

Let's see what Fortune says

&gt;Germany has also benefited from the fixed exchange rate that the Euro effectively secures between itself and its major European markets. This means that its export boom was not offset by a rise in its own currency. If Germany had been outside the Euro, currency appreciation would have hurt Germany’s gains. Not so in the Eurozone.


Yeah, that sounds right. 

&gt;fiscal transfers such as unemployment and housing benefits, shared health care costs, or the pooling of bank risks and deposit insurance. The Eurozone also lacks the large movement of workers across state borders enjoyed by the United States, mostly due to language and regulatory barriers. These institutional features of the Eurozone have created a highly unfair economic union, which magnifies disproportionately the consequences of failure.


Well, and now we know this article to be incorrect, because it forgot about the open and free travel of EU nationstates as it relates to work, retirement, and holidays.    

And it appearently thinks the US, one of the top five toughest nations to immigrate too, has open borders.

For me it isn't really increasing spending if you say here is more money...but you can't spend it as you need to make 'efficiency savings', in fact you need to spend even less than you were before!

Did you even read my comment? I just went through **every single point** he mentioned in the video... None of them were lies... What are you talking about? Would you like me to go through it again, because you either didn't read it, couldn't understand it, or willfully ignored it when I said it last time... Fuck it, I'll put it down again;

&gt; Trump did say he would do the things he was doing, the EU commissioners are not elected by the people they preside over. EU Commissioners are the only ones in the EU Parliament that can propose legislation. UKIP did win the European election in 2014. And, to him, it does seem like anti-American rhetoric (whether it is or not is debatable, but he said the word 'seems').

That is, *literally*, what came out of his mouth. **Where. Is. The. Lie?**

&gt; You say he didn't lie at all during that video.

Because he didn't.

&gt; Does that meant the session too?

That speech, in the video, was his *first* speech in that session. So there wasn't an opportunity for him to lie before that. He may, or may not, have lied after that (and I am not saying he did), but you can't put a sign up accusing somebody of lying before they've lied. It doesn't work that way. 

&gt; Are you sure?

Absolutely. 

&gt; Did you watch it?

Yes.

&gt; I don't trust the guy who put a big thing on buses

I assume you are talking about the £350 million a week for the NHS?

Got news for you - He didn't. That claim was made by the 'Vote Leave' campaign. Nigel Farage was not only **NOT** part of that campaign, he was actually involved in a rival campaign called 'Grassroots Out' (GO) and, previously, Leave.EU. Blaming a man who was not part of that organisation for the actions of said organisation would be like me robbing a bank, then you blaming a random person who was in the bank that day.

He was not, at any point, part of the campaign that put that particular claim on the side of a bus. To blame that on him is at best misinformed, at worst, an outright lie.

&gt; made it a KEY part of the campaign

The claim was that we would have 350 million *available* for things *like* the NHS. Or education. Or housing. Or the military. And we will, when we leave. How would you expect a bunch of people not in government to implement such a policy? Especially as *we haven't even left yet*.

And, actually, the key part of the GO and Leave.EU campaigns (that would be the campaigns Farage was *actually* involved in, not the one you and many others pretend he was involved in) was about sovereignty and national borders.

&gt; then backtracked like a mofo right after winning.

He didn't backtrack because, as stated before, he was not part of the Vote Leave campaign who made the claim. And that's a fucking fact mate, like it or not.

t5_2qiqi,1488483058,False,1485992689,,dd7iihf,"Title:  Barte’s Book of Martyrs
 
Author:  Billy Barte
Genre:  History, non-fiction
Released:  1559
 
Plot Summary:  A summary of Magical Martyrs in Europe

The book was produced with over 25 illustrations.  A single volume book, the work is a historical summary of conflict between muggles and magical folk resulting in the torture and deaths of key figures.   The conflict resulted in changes to how magical people interacted with muggles.   This book includes their struggles as they were burned at the stake, beheaded, tortured, drawn and quartered, or disemboweled.

In addition to magical martyrs, the book does note the historical deaths of muggles that were falsely accused of magic.
 

Excerpt:   Aloiscis Penopy; 1148 (est);  Penopy practiced alchemy and was a local healer living in the midst of a muggle community when it was said he was talking to birds.  A local magistrate in the muggle community resented the attention and favors Penopy received as his reputation spread across the region.  To combat this. The magistrate bribed witnesses to testify that Penopy was an evil magician practicing in the dark arts.  Penopy, who had been incapacitated when he was seized by the locals had no means of escape.  A quick trial was held, and he was burned at the stake.

It is not confirmed that Penopy was initially reported to the magistrate by a dark wizard. 

Trivia:  Many of the illustrations are based on alleged eye witness accounts. Barte was a passionate researcher committed to objectivity.  He was apt not to be accusatory of the muggles responsible for the act. 
 
The muggles noted in the book were not aware that magical people were living in Europe.
 
The book has been required reading in many of the schools across Europe through the 19th century.

t5_2qh0u,1488483141,False,1486010827,,dd7ini1,"**The Second American Revolution**

*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

The *Second American Revolution* was a political upheaval that took place between 2017 and 2020 during which the citizens of the United States rejected rule of 45th president of the United State Donald Trump and his Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. 

The revolution followed a long period of protests related to the many controversial executive orders and other actions taken by Trump, during which he lost the support of the majority of the base that had voted him in to office. The event that spurred the first major violence between the Trump forces and those of the Revolutionaries was the beheading of beloved American author George RR Martin. 

After season 7 of the hit series *Game of Thrones* began in June of 2017, retweets and tags of President Trump dropped off from social media considerably as the American public's attention turned to the popular HBO show. Trump, known for his infamous ego, decided to garner attention to himself and away from the show permanently by publicly executing Martin in Washington DC, after promising the American public that no harm would come to the man until the book series was completed. This act was the idea of Bannon, who criticized the show since as 'multicultural' and 'anti-white.' Bannon stated his disdain for the show in spring of 2017:

""This garbage is openly promoting an anti-white agenda. An army of white nordic soldiers are the main enemy. That is a direct attack by liberals on the European- Christian heritage of this country. This Jon Snow character openly defies laws and brings thousands of refugees past the Great Wall defending his own border. That was written as a direct attack of President Trump. The show is encouraging civil unrest- the so called 'heroes' are teaming up with slaves, middle-easterners, and Spaniards against this army of Whites. It's nothing less than propaganda from the extreme leftist of Hollywood, and it is aimed directly at influencing our youth! They are promoting a new civil war in our nations, and we will not stand for it.""

To be clear, these events were written for the book and show before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, but this fact was ignored. George RR Martin was arrested on orders from Bannon, and made to confess (after several days of torture) that he was actually trying to encourage a liberal revolution against the President. Martin was told that with this confession, he would be allowed to stay in his home on house arrest, and finish his fantasy series *A Song of Ice and Fire*, upon which *Game of Thrones* is based. Bannon had planned on forcing Martin to finish the series with a very Pro-Trump ending, after which Martin would carry out a life-sentence guarding the planned Trump-Border Wall, but Trump's own temperament did not allow this to happen. After a ferocious twitter storm than many classified as a temper-tantrum, Trump ordered Martin beheaded.

This event was the last straw for much of the American populace, and the first battle was fought in Washington the next day after rioters burned down Trump's DC hotel.

&gt;who demand that immigrants adapt to Western culture rather than continue to clash with it.

I don't demand anything, because I'm don't believe in people being forced to do anything.  I am also not a drama queen who insists they're clashing with anyone.  The only clash I see here is pissy white people flipping out when they see a woman's hair covered with some cloth.  OH NO WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS DOOMED!

&gt;It's a very bold statement against that culture.

No, you are just being a baby.  No one is making a statement other than ""I don't want to expose my beauty.""  Which is a legitimate stance that you have no business in interpreting otherwise or demanding it stop.  Unless, of course, you like tyranny and oppression.

&gt;Believing you are free to reject host culture

lmao yeah ok.  easy for you to say, your ""host"" culture is built on centuries of wealth stolen from other people.  Additionally, European culture has been dead since WWII.  It's basically American culture now.  Culture dies constantly.  Stop clinging to it like it means anything.  It's fluid, and less than 1% of people aren't threatening anything.

&gt;It has led to Brexit, Trump, Le Pen, Switzerland banning Minarets, and France/Austria banning face coverings.

Yeah, right.  That's what caused it.  Excluding Trump (who was elected solely because his competition was hated more), all those things are caused by decades...nay, centuries of European nationalism and colonial history of xenophobia and genocide.  The very engrained idea that European culture is the only civilized culture, and it's the duty of Europe to spread it's culture and destroy others.  This has nothing to do with a headscarf being a symbol, and everything to do with Europeans being some of the most Racist people on earth.  The holocaust wasn't caused by Hitler.  it was caused by a culmination, a climax, of European culture.  Having some outside perspective is good for Europe, but European nationalists are stuck in the 1800s.

&gt;Was it worth resisting Western culture?

A man not learning the language (while his children did) is not a big deal.  Again, those things happened because nationalists aren't logical.

&gt;Do you believe that an entire country should change to accommodate outside influences?

Your country has laws and ideals.  They should not change them because some brown people showed up, which is exactly what they're doing.

&gt; The current global political climate is a reaction against this.

Exactly!  It's reactionary, primal, mindless!  It's fear mongering and pride!  it's not intellect, rationality, or justice.

&gt; My advice to you would be to put pressure on others to adopt Western culture and fully assimilate into the country in which they live.

No, because that happens naturally, as it has in the US for decades.  Just because people haven't tried to go to Europe until 20 years ago, doesn't mean your panic is justified.

Already done, Clinton is gone.

There is already a mess in Yemen. All we can do is prevent it from becoming worse in a way that would threaten us.

&gt; I am a fan of how we did it actually. Not getting in until we were actually attacked.

The Nazis never attacked us. So... you think we just shouldn't have armed the British and the Russians against the Nazis? Great.

&gt; Should we go into Darfur as well then? Iran? North Korea? Saudi Arabia?

Yes, we should have done more to prevent the genocide in Darfur. We should have done more the prevent the genocide in Rwanda. Tell me, how many people must die before we, who can do something, should do something? A hundred thousand? A million? Ten million? What's your number?

&gt;Yes, why do we have a base in Lebanon, and everywhere else in the world?

Did you just take the side of Al Qaeda? Because it certainly sounds it. We have a base in Lebanon because they requested it out of fear of Iraq. Just like how every base we have around the world is at the request of the host government, with one exception. If, for example, Japan wanted us to leave Okinawa, we would.

&gt; No I'm not, and no we didn't. We worked to oust Assad.

Yes, you are, and yes, we did. This was like, just last year, as well as multiple times before it. How can you already have forgetten this? http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/07/14/486005012/u-s-russia-working-on-a-plan-to-coordinate-bombing-in-syria

&gt;Oh, you mean Al Queda... Oops I mean Al Nusra. Which fucking terrorist group were we arming there again?

No, I don't mean Al Qaeda (btw, I spelled it for you a ton of time, get it right) or Al Nursa. Russia bombed US directly : https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-strikes-on-remote-syria-garrison-alarm-u-s-1469137231
 as well as our moderate opposition allies:
http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-russia-syria-strikes-20160617-snap-story.html

As for your claim about ""us arming terrorists"" we supported moderates, who then got swept up by larger Islamist groups, after which we stopped supporting them. Now we arm the Kurds and the SDF. Neither of which are at all terrorists. But knowing this would require actually paying attention to world events, and not just regurgitating headlines you've read from RT.  

&gt;There doesn't need to be a nuance other than we need to get off our high horse trying to oust Assad

You mean the guy who killed millions of his own citizens because they dare demand more freedom? That ""high horse?""

&gt;Which put us at odds with Syria and Russia, and put us on the side of Iran.

Iran is Syria's largest ally. You saying the above is definitive proof that you have no idea what's happening in Syria, and should consider staying quiet about it, less you embarrass yourself even further. 

&gt;The only nuance being missed here is by you not realizing this proxy war has us fighting on the same side as terrorists, and then fighting against terrorists, and fighting on the same side as Russia, and fighting against russia, and fighting on the same side as syria, but then fighting against syria.

Yeah, foreign policy is complicated, and stuff changes over time. Sorry you're unable to wrap your head around that. That doesn't mean that your know-nothing policy of sticking your head in the sand is going to work.

&gt;Obama dropped 26000 bombs last year on false pretenses

Yeah, mostly on ISIS, who, if you haven't noticed is planning and inspiring terrorist attacks around the world constantly. So you think we should just leave them alone? 

&gt;Quaddafi, who wasn't about to commit genocide...

Yes, he was. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/19/gaddafi-forces-battle-for-benghazi

&gt;Here you go guys, we took out your leader, now fight ISIS all by yourself. Good luck!

So what, exactly, do you want? Should we have stayed in Libya and done nation-building like we did in Iraq? Should we arm and support the Libyan government? (We already do.)

&gt;Our bombs cause much of our mess. This is a problem. 

Is an idiot's view of the world. YOU can't decide what you think the US should do, and keep going back and forth. ""We shouldn't have bases anywhere"" ""We should ally with Russia and Syria (and Iran, if you knew that, which you didn't) against ISIS"" ""We shouldn't ally with terrorists (like Iran)"" ""We shouldn't have left Libya to deal with ISIS alone!"" Can't you see that? All you have is criticism. Everything the US has done, to you is wrong, yet you can't see the difference and the nuances of American foreign policy. It's beyond you that Obama learned the lesson of not getting involved in nation-building from Iraq when dealing with Libya, and learned the lesson of Libya to not trust the Europeans to clean up the mess (as they promised to in Libya) when dealing with Syria. Our policy has changed and adapted to the specific circumstance of each country, and to the geopolitical realities. Because everyone who actually studies this stuff, and knows what they're talking about (like, for example, that Iran and Syria have been allies for decades) knows that we can't just pack it all up and go home, because the world would get much worse there, and the violence would follow us home.

If you find any grammatical or spelling mistakes, I hope you know that they are there because I didn't feel it necessary to proofread and correct them, because I feel as if my audience (you) isn't worth the trouble. I'm sure you actually believe that most people won't dignify you with a response because they don't have one. Yeah, thats not true buddy, we got em, most of us just believe that you aren't worth our time and effort. It's hard enough to make political arguments on the internet, but having to change the crazy minds of the mentally ill is another task entirely. But here goes.

I guess I felt that this is necesssary because wow, you could not be farther from the truth. I've been here in normal, sane America for the last 18 months. The one that Donald Trump's policies are going to destroy. And I don't see how you can't understand the threat that he poses to this country, regardless of your political views.
 
There is documented evidence of deals he's made in foreign countries. He is still financially involved in all of his businesses while simultaneously being the President and making decisions that impact those finances daily. While I won't say that is a direct violation of the Emoluments clause because I'm no expert, but in response to concerns from the left and right he did NOTHING. As long as he remains a stakeholder it will factor into his decisions. As long as Ivanka, Jared, Don, and Eric are involved in the business and are consulting their father on government there is a huge issue.

How about the threat that he poses to world order? I just finished listening to Dan Carlin's latest podcast (a noted independent who didn't support any candidate in November, a free thinker, if you will) and it left me terrified for this country's future. This man, who can barely stop himself from responding on Twitter to attacks from people he shouldn't care about and shouldn't even have the time to care about, is the only one who stands between this country and nuclear war. The world has remained safe from total war for SEVENTY years now. In an age where we have the technology to create weapons that are capable of killing hundreds of millions at a time, I don't think it is ut of line to have an experience, competent individual as President who has the self-control and decision making abilities to not respond to tweets, let alone the threats of nuclear war.

He has consistently criticized NATO, the EU, gobal trade deals and anything that contributes to the world order that we currently find ourselves in. The same world order that has prevented both total and Nuclear war, the same world order that has kept Europe at peace for one of the longest periods ever, the same world order that has rocketed America to the top, the same world order that has destroyed the Russian economy and will eventually lead to a collapse of there authoritarian system. I am thrilled that he has General Mattis in his cabinet to set him straight when it comes to these issuses because lord knows he has appeared uninformed on them and unwilling to honor them. I would rather we had a President capable of understanding world order and international affairs and I find it frightening that we need Generals whose only experience is war to stop our President from overaggression but whatever.

Now comes China, clearly the #2 on the world stage. He pulled us unilaterally out of TPP, got completely played by Taiwan, has proposed hostile trade and currency policies that would cripple American business, and is apparently willing to engage with China in the SCS as well. The TPP was our ticket into the Southeast Asian markets. It was a national security tool meant to keep us on top, as any trade deal is meant to. ""But all our jobs are going to leave!!"" Yeah, no shit, as technology makes it easier to do business in cheaper parts of the world, guess what's going to happen? These businesses that love there profit margins are going to move. That's how basic economics and the free market capitalism that Republicans claim to love so much works. Now, could the deal have been renegotiated to lessen the impact on the midwest? Sure, but that's not what Trump did. He threw away years of work and allowed Chinese businesses to enter and control some of the worlds fastest growing markets.

His muslim ban is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. It's main purpose isn't safety, it's discrimination. U.S. serviceman have already been talking about how it puts them at risk in the field. It makes it harder for civilians in the middle east to trust them. It makes it harder for them to get help and intelligence because people that helped our military out and risked there lives for this country more the Donald Trump ever has aren't allowed in. But maybe you only care about the white people that help America? Maybe you don't care that a lot of these refugees are in the most pitiful of circumstances and have been for years while awaiting entrance to the land of opportunity. Frankly I think any argument around immigration or travel is just going to fly right over your head because these people all have brown skin but I'll just point out that immigration grows our society, it strengthens our national alliances, and is fundamentally necessary for a country with a large aging demographic like ours. 

How about energy policy? How about the fact that climate change was classified as the biggest national security threat by the Pentagon? All of the hard work in Paris by experts and scientists thrown out the window. Just open the floodgates of coal, oil, and fracking and let our children face the dire financial consequences that we will have to pay. How about the fact that next leader in clean, alternative energy is going to be the worlds biggest superpower? The next generation of people will not be living off natural resources that pollute our world, they'll be living off nuclear fusion or a massive expansion of green energy. But instead of believing scientifically based evidence of climate change, instead of recognizing the greatest financial opportunity of the 21st century, instead of trying to help the middle class with the jobs of the future, Donald Trump is climate change deying, allowing China to take the global lead, and trying to bring back polluting, economically unviable forms of energy like coal and oil. His voters have been swindled. The plant/factory/mine that Dad worked at will NOT be reopening because of globalism/free trade/etc., it's because dying industries that are bad for this world and that don't help this country maintain it's status as a global leader deserve to die, and by the laws of a free market will. 

HEY GUESS WHAT? I'm so manipulated by the media and short on reasonable responses that I actually had to break up this post into another one. Shit, the next one's so good you'll realize if you haven't already that I actually can explain myself and am capable of ""free thought"". Shocker right?

Oui en effet j'ai vu que les délais pouvaient être longs dans un de ces posts, mais je ne compte pas acheter sur un coup de tête et donc j'espère qu'entre le moment où je me décide pour un achat et celui ou je paye les fonds seront disponibles.

&gt;À long terme, les actions ont tendance à monter… par contre si tu es dans un « creux » (tu as mois d'argent que ce que tu as investi) au moment où tu cherches à acheter, c'est un peu dommage…

En fait, je me demandais si ça servait d'ouvrir un PEA pour faire date, comme pour une AV. Disons que dans cinq ans je me mette à dynamiser mon épargne avec ce PEA ouvert, mes bénéfices ne seront directement pas imposables sur le revenu. Je ne sais pas si cette approche est pertinente, d'où ma question concernant ce placement.

When I lived in Glasgow the council had a program for youth football and it was free but I was too young to understand how it worked or what level the coaching was. There wasn't actually a coach and no practices. Just a manager for the matches at the leisure center. In America there has been an amazing organization called AYSO which has been around since the 70's or something. Long before I arrived here. They have always been very popular for young children, with participation declining as children get older, especially secondary school age. But in The past 10 years or so, soccer in America has had an explosion and AYSO is not the only organization in town anymore. There are many clubs that offer these expensive competitive soccer programs and AYSO is shrinking in influence. Or perhaps staying the same but not in proportion to the increased popularity of the sport. Kids are continuing to play club soccer through their secondary school years and right up until college. There are academies for all of the MLS teams and some of them are partnered with big European clubs like Manchester City and Real Salt Lake. My friend's 15 year old son (the family lives here in San Diego) was recruited and now lives and trains and gets his education at their academy in Arizona. But that is not very common. The biggest economy of this American youth soccer industry is these expensive soccer clubs charging thousands per year to the parents of mediocre players who play in the B and C reserve teams and those clubs who organize fee based tournaments for such teams.

If it doesn't have magical depression beings traumatizing you every day, it's almost certainly better.

&gt; Can you imagine trying to jail Bellatrix Lestrange when she isn't under influence of the dementors?

Yes. It's only difficult if she can perform potent magic without a wand. Which is the entire point of contention. You are taking one canon-compatible position and insisting it's the only conceivable truth.

&gt; The wizarding world isn't this horrible place compared to the muggle world. It's the same as the muggle world.

&gt; In the past hour I've seen multiple comments mentioning how horrible the Wizarding World really is. From Azkaban, to house elves, to goblins, discrimination, Dumbledore, Muggles and so on. And I roll my eyes every time I read them.

That's a ""it's not *that* bad"" thesis. The misunderstandings are entirely your fault.

As for it not being much worse than the Muggle UK, consider it from a perspective of injustices per capita. Also consider that it's easier to ignore distant injustices than nearby injusticies.

I grew up in a town of 8,000 people. If we operated a prison of despair, if we had a mayor who ordered two different people to be executed on sight, if we had dozens or hundreds of slaves, if we had another race of people who were not allowed tools that everyone else used to make everything in their life easier (perhaps they need to use gasoline generators rather than the electric grid?) -- that would be a much more present set of problems. It would feel much more evil. It would be much harder to ignore.

&gt; There actually is an Office of House Elf Relocation.

Which is powerless to stop Lucius Malfoy from abusing Dobby.

&gt; Canon never specifies borders

True, but it has Bulgaria and France and England and Albania. Bulgaria wasn't a country between 1400 and 1870. Albania wasn't a country between 1450 and 1910. We don't see a magical nation of Cornwall or Brittany or Toulouse or Province or Leinster. We don't see a magical Holy Roman Empire of Germanic princedoms.

We *do* see that the nation containing Hogwarts polices the Forest of Dean and Little Hangleton. We see that it has citizens residing in Cornwall, Scotland, London, Wiltshire, and the Highlands.

We also see that the Ministry seems to work with the Muggle government.

Nothing conclusive, but everything we *do* see suggests similar borders.

&gt; Centaurs live in a forest, don't seem to use their currency, they have their own command structure and have no regard for the MoM's authority.

There are communes like that around.

In the US, we have a number of dependent sovereign nations. The Seven Council Fires (also known as Sioux) have been on the news lately because the US is annexing their territory to put an oil pipeline through it. By treaty, half of South Dakota belongs to them, but that's never going to happen. If the centaurs have that sort of relationship with the Ministry, they're screwed.

&gt; Would the USA give their advanced weaponry to North Korea?

Every human has a wand. Every human can purchase a wand. Wands have been around on the British Isles for two thousand years. Wands are in use throughout Europe and the Americas. Wands are tools with many purposes and not specifically weapons. Goblins control what Hagrid refers to as *the* wizard bank and have for 125 years, peacefully, at the start of the series. The amount of damage you can do with one wand is much closer to the damage you can do with one pistol than with cruise missiles or other modern military munitions. The USA gives advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia.

So your analogy kind of sucks.

From _Deathly Hallows_:

&gt; “The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been contested between wizards and goblins.”

The *right to carry*.

Of course, it's *also* a matter of keeping it secret, as Griphook continues:

&gt; “That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!”

But that requires collusion across many nations and many wandmakers. It only takes one wandmaker succumbing to the siren song of a giant pile of money (or a sword pointed at their throat) for the secret to get out. And that *also* doesn't lead to it being illegal for goblins to *carry* a wand -- Neville Longbottom could purchase and carry a wand, but he couldn't build one.",0,3,t1_dd7eumu,HPfanfiction,tkannelid,,0,t3_5rfrg7,RV,1485988177,

Specifically, I think it's a bit where a minor lord exchanges a piece of land (presumably a small village or hamlet) with an abbot in exchange for a coat of mail. Frances Gies (not the best of sources) gives 100 shillings as the price of a coat of mail in the 12th century, this at a time when the annual profit of many villages would be less than that. 

I can't recollect my source for the exact value of a horse in the 11th century, though I believe Gies gives 50 shillings (two and one-half pounds) as the cost of a warhorse in the 12th century. Christopher Dyer in *Standards of Living in the Later Middle Ages* states that in the 13th century, they could cost as much as *eighty pounds*. This is at a time when a semi-skilled laborer might make two pence a day; two pence is 1/120th of a pound, so if Dyer is right, the most expensive warhorses would cost more than a working man could hope to earn in his life.

These figures should be taken with a grain of salt, as the records are just not great for the 11th-12th century. However, if Dominique Barthelemy is to be believed (and it's looking like his view is coming to be the consensus), the *relative* price of mail and horse in the 10th-11th centuries was such that a knight was by default a nobleman, because no one else could afford the stuff. In general, the European economy expanded starting about 1000-1050 and peaking in the late 13th century, crashing in the early-mid 14th, and rising again after that. Part of this economic (and demographic) expansion was that arms, armor, and horses seem to have gotten cheaper and more numerous.",0,19,t1_dd78df5,AskHistorians,Rittermeister,,0,t3_5rexwz,europe,1485988321,

Obviously letting the east walk away and officially ending the conflict would be the best thing, and let Kiev work on EU/NATO association.

It was the position of the Conservative Party and the UK Government at the time that the UK should remain a part of the European Union.

The country expressed it's opinion on that suggestion and following a change of government, the policy has changed to one that will now mean an implementation of the will of the people.

That might not have been the will of myself as an individual voter, but it is the will of the majority and that must be respected.

&gt;But if, as you suppose, better ideas are enough to combat nazism, then why is the altright and white ethnocentrism growing in the USA?

Perhaps because their opposition has precisely *not* been doing so with better ideas but by trying to sling mud, silence or threaten. Personally I blame the regressives for the rise of the far right. And they still don't get it. Which means it's just going to get worse before until they do. Let's hope it won't be too late by then.

&gt;As an aside, violence and censorship have both proven to work to fight nazism. Violence as illustrated by events like WW2

Are you seriously presenting WW2 as an example of successful defeat of national socialism? Have you forgotten the price that was paid for that ""victory""? 
And the ironic part is, the war wasn't even declared because of the ideology of a ""white ethnostate"" but because of the military expansion of the Nazi regime. 

&gt;Censorship as evidenced by the many anti-nazi laws put into place by various European countries (Germany, Austria, etc.) and subsequent dearth of influence of these groups in the mainstream.

I assure you, the censorship is *not* the reason for that dearth of influence. Also, I don't think you understand the problem with censorship. It's always just a tool that those in power use to stay in power. That's all it is. The only reason you like it is because, out of some unfathomable naivety, you seem to believe that your ideas are the ones that won't be censored. It must be nice to feel so safe but it's not realistic. Even if you're fortunate enough to have your views shared by those in power, you *must* realize that you can't rely on that always being the case. And when the day comes when your views become the ""bad"" views, then you'll be screwed because you handed them the tools to silence you with.

&gt; The House of Representatives voted to repeal to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule on oil, gas and mining companies that is aimed at preventing corruption. The House passed, on a vote of 235-187, a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act disapproving the rule established by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires […]

And from [ZeroHedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-01/house-kills-requirement-energy-companies-disclose-payments-foreign-governments)...
&gt; In a victory for the US oil, gas and mining industry, which for years has appealed to the executive branch and courts to eliminate a rule which Exxon Mobil (whose former CEO was just confirmed as US Secretary of State), Chevron and other producers alleged put them at a disadvantage against foreign competitors, this afternoon the House approved a resolution killing an SEC requirement for US energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments, known as the ""extraction rule.""
&gt; 
&gt; The industry had claimed that the rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank act, gives global rivals a competitive edge. Backers, on the other hand, said the rule would keep payments to foreign nations in government coffers, not private pockets, and generally avoid bribes and graft.
&gt; 
&gt; Because Exxon and Chevron aren’t listed on the European exchanges, they don’t have to comply with the EU disclosure rules [Bloomberg explains](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-31/exxon-set-for-early-victory-as-congress-to-rescind-payments-rule). That may give them an edge over other oil majors who must report project-level payments, critics say. In its 2015 disclosure to the UK, Rosneft reported $29.8 million in payments to the Russian Federation, Vietnam, Brazil and Norway. In the same year, BP reported $15.2 billion in payments to 23 countries, Total disclosed $16.7 billion to 44 countries, and Shell reported $21.8 billion to 24 countries.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea behind the measure is simple: If foreign oil companies disclose payments of $1 million to the government of Country X, then the lawmakers and citizens of Country X will know that $1 million should show up on the country’s budget. If less shows up, then obviously some of that amount was ""diverted for private use"" i.e., embezzled.
&gt; 
&gt; ExxonMobil and Chevron have said they support financial transparency in the oil sector. Both are members of an advisory committee under the Interior Department that oversees a voluntary corporate financial disclosure program. However, in comments to the SEC, the companies say they would support a version of the regulation that protected company-specific data. They argue that the current SEC rule would make available potentially valuable company information to state-owned competitors such as Saudi Aramco and Cnooc Ltd., neither of which are subject to the disclosure rules.

The effect is quite nice actually and can be fun to look at in a dark room, with a Raindrop RGB mode going, so ducky painting the backplate black on their Shine 6 special edition makes a lot of sense.

This effect is completely lost on a white backplate.  When I threw these caps on an iKBC F108 and a Shine 5, it simply looked subpar, because the entire floating effect of being ""airborne"" was completely lost from all of the reflections coming from the LEDs hitting the white painted backplate.  It really didn't look that good, though maybe some people might like it.  But I feel there's just too much reflections going on.

Some people in Europe got white floating keycaps (same super gamer font) on their Shine 6's...no idea how white would look on a black backplate (probably still good), but white floating caps on a white backplate...not digging my imagination of that.

I decided I'd try it for a bit and while it wasn't bad, I honestly missed home. There's a lot of shitty things about my city that I can't stand (mainly the fucking streets) but I wouldn't trade this place for the world. It also doesn't help that recently my mother was diagnosed with Lupus (and chronic lung disease) and while she handles it fine now, the first couple of months was *really* bad for her so I wanted to be close by just in case she needed me/something turned for the worst.


I took a lot of history classes/etc for my credits in LA for Biochem since history is personally one of my favorite subjects (next to Biology!) and I found out I was really close to finishing a History degree as well. I needed something like 12 credits in a foreign language and another ~12 or so credits for History (which was like, 2 semesters as a part time student) so I decided that I would simply finish my History degree just to have it. I finished it and I was so happy with the subject/school/life I decided I might as well continue my education until I run out of grants/scholarship opportunities.

Well I haven't run out of scholarship opportunities yet and I can still take around ~4 classes a semester for an incredibly low ~1180$ a semester (one class is around 2500$ just as an example) so I figured I might as well take advantage of it and push my degree as far as I can take it.

Sometimes I get annoyed, because I fucking despise European history (seriously have you fuckers looked at the familial lines for the Hapsburg Empire?) but for the most part I've never been happier than now and I think my current degree choice, and career path, was the proper one.

t5_2yuqy,1488485600,False,1485991643,,dd7mqsj,"I got hit with a catastrophic spinal tumor at 28.  I was busting ass working, paying off high student loans from  7 years of working hard in college, had great insurance through work, and was (previously) very healthy and fit.  I lived a modest life while paying down my student debts.

Then one day I woke up feeling like a tennis ball was stuffed down my spinal column.  And quickly learned how FUCKED the US is.  My own parents and brother, who were blessed with great health, still consider the US a great country who always takes care of their own.  Why? Because nothing bad ever happened to them and they do enough shady things when they get into financial trouble to save their own asses.  

I lost everything. WITH insurance.  Hit a point where I was vomiting and fainting from pain at work, so I knew I had to quit.  Disability in CA was good, but that only lasts one year.  If you are below retirement age, you must wait TWO YEARS to even apply for Federal social security disability (which is a relative pittance) and Medicare (which is limited, still expensive, esp if you cannot work, and sucks. Most of my meds were not covered and docs are not required to accept Medicare).

I had to file bankruptcy.  I also had to fly to a Western European nation on my dime to have my life saved when I had 2 weeks left to live.  The US does not GIVE A RAT'S ASS if you get sick.  You are on your own.  You may get a pittance IF you are lucky. These days (I've done some pro bono cases for disabled clients/friends) the Social Security dep't will automatically deny applicants seeking disability help.  Even Stage 4 cancer patients. Then its a 2 year battle and those poor, sick, exhausted people (I represented myself during my cases and let me tell you, fighting just to get health care to LIVE and a bit of money from a system you PAID INTO FOR DECADES when you are already on the brink of death is a good way to die a thousand deaths) must endure.  

They are forced to go to ""independent doctor appts"" by the social security admin. These are whore doctors who of course get rewarded by claiming the patient is at best mildly sick but can work. I've sat in on those ""examinations"" where the doc doesn't review MRIs or the record, takes maybe 10 minutes to roll their eyes, takes no notes, gets angry if the patient tries to explain their pain/disease/misery. I've been in court hearings where the SS rep said a client of mine who had major disc degeneration disease and a brain tumor and who had such severe back pain he could not stand up, much less sit, and spent most of his day bed-bound, and lost so much weight and all muscle mass from pain alone (and this guy was once super fit) claim, ""the applicant may have some pain, but Tylenol can help that and the applicant would be best suited as a waiter or busboy.""   (Remember: this rep is not a physician and has zero medical/rehap training.)

The US is a fucking disaster in helping its sick, its poor, its vets or anyone unlucky enough to get injured/ill.  Had I not flown to Western Europe (who did the exact same surgery that would've been billed at 200k in the US, but cost me 5k (NOT covered by insurance, not reduced, FULL price of surgery/consults/all MRIs/calls to my home/hospital stay at a great hospital) I'd have long since been dead.

For such an advanced, wealthy country, the US is a place where if you get sick and are not independently wealthy, you will likely lose everything, go bankrupt, beg for years to get piddly benefits from a system you paid thousands into during your working years while being told you really aren't that sick, will be forced to wait 2 years to even apply for assistance (they hope you die in the meantime).

Its so fucked.

OP, I am so, so sorry.  You have every right to be enraged.  If I were healthy and it were feasible, I'd donate any body part to keep you alive.  You worked so hard to fight this.  I hope there is a way you can find, somehow, to be at peace with what your family is facing.  Bankruptcy was something I avoided for years, but reality hit and I finally filed (this is years ago) and it was the best financial decision I ever made. Wiped out all the debt and I was able to slowly rebuilt.  For the future of your family, I'm not sure if that's already occurred or of the specifics, but if you have not already looked into it on their behalf, please do.  

I was ready to jump off a bridge from the combo of unbearable pain and the relentless financial stresses.  Having a terminal disease is a hell I can somewhat imagine (I had no kids, so I didn't have that awful worry you have), but you add the financial stress on top of it and it just destroys whatever strength you have left that you are hoping to devote to make your final days on earth as positive as possible.

If your reply wasn't meant to be serious why not just walk back on it? Or just say 'it was just bantz' and brush it off. Instead you decided to write your own serious response.

I contradicted the second part (at least when it comes to Sam Harris) not the first part. You bringing up an out of context quote from Harris about the first part does not contradict anything I stated. The reason I brought up Ali is because that is the example Harris used. When I replied to you, you said his reasoning was that it prevented non-muslims too.

No surprises there.

&gt; My problem is with the political institution of the EU.

Not talking about you personally, but realistically most citizens within the EU have very little idea about what the EU does or how it works and therefore shouldn't be passing judgement one way or the other. What we can all say is that the EU has terrible PR. Maybe they should spend more on presentation and communication, I don't know.

Regardless of that, two big problems you are going to see with Brexit: 

1. It is economic suicide for the UK. This is very plain and simple and you don't need a degree in economics to understand it. Every time the UK edges closer to that door (behind which lies a precipice), sterling devalues a bit more (it's important to understand that anybody with a UK wage or UK denominated assets is already 20% worse off in real terms before much has happened and should rightly be furious about that already). So sterling goes down further, therefore inflation goes up (mechanistically, and this is actually amplified by the much heralded trade deficit), and therefore interest rates inevitably get forced up, in order to prevent a Weimar style run on the pound (which may turn out to be unavoidable but let's remain optimistic here). Apart from the inflation and lower buying power of wages, you can reasonably expect to see a flood of repossessions and negative equity in the property market when this catches up. Foreign booze, mobile roaming, flights, holidays etc are going to become the province of the more well off again as in the pre single market days. ('Project fear' underestimated if anything, but they made the very common ideological mistake of assuming the markets were rational and it would therefore kick in immediately). Already 90% of the UK favours remaining in the single market which is a damn sight more certainty about the 'will of the people' than anything else that has been on the table. When economic carnage starts to rip, it's clear that foreign and domestic fatcats will be picking over fire sale assets (I might even join in a bit of that at the lower end), but I find it hard to imagine how it will play out among the general public. Social cohesion and national pride isn't at the top of the list though 

2. It _reduces_ 'sovereignty' to be a bit player rather than have a veto and lead role in a huge bloc - because when it comes to trade and defence, size is what matters. (I'm disregarding the potential break up of the UK at this point as it's too speculative though the current arguments around Wales, NI, and Scotland are hardly glory days for sovereignty.) You've only got to look at the spectacle of Theresa May jumping the gun to go and lick Trump's boots before legging it over to make nice with Erdogan if you want to know what post-Brexit sovereignty is about. Complete farce 

The only possible benefit to the UK of Brexit is in the event of WW3 breaking out and possibly having more opportunities to stay neutral, if perhaps more vulnerable. (The other scenario regularly cited is in the event of EU collapse but I'm not sure membership or not would make much difference to the outcome given that the UK has its own currency.)",0,2,t1_dd7lk74,pics,chu,,0,t3_5rg4bn,,1485992148,

I'm not ignoring the fact that ISIS exists and hates America and in fact I fully understand that they do and partially why they might not like us (we kinda fucked up their region for decades among other things).

I was quick to jump the gun and I should not have assumed your position. After everything that I've read on this subreddit, I hope that you can understand where I'm coming from. What I've found is that people wilfully ignore ISIS or the immediate danger it represents in order to justify their own tolerant position. Again, I assumed that you were one of those. 

&gt; And another thing, it's idiotic for a terrorist to try to use the refugee admissions process to get into America. As I said, at ANY point can a person be denied if anything connecting them to terrorist activity shows up or something else that would make it dangerous to have them in our country.

Terrorists can only flourish if they have a support network. Whether through funding, corrupt officials or a network of citizens who are not in fact terrorists themselves, but do support the cause of ISIS. Fighters have already come to Europe and once cleared they could travel through South America of via Canada who are generally more accepting. I agree to your last point, but we need to ensure that Obama's systems are indeed as thorough as stated before moving forward.

&gt;You do a DNA test on a pure African, European and Asian and there will be genetic differences. They may be tiny, but there will be differences.

Sorry but this is just not true at all. Check out the facts... The genetic differences between individuals within a ""race"" are more significant that between ""races"". Have you studied genetics much in any real capacity? If you had, you would find the data does not support your claim to any degree.

&gt; ...in a paper titled “The Apportionment of Human Diversity,” Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin showed that human populations, then held to be races, were far more genetically diverse than anyone had imagined. Lewontin’s study was based on molecular-genetic techniques and provided statistical analysis of 17 polymorphic sites, including the major blood groups in the races as they were conventionally defined: Caucasian, African, Mongoloid, South Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians and Australian Aborigines. **What he found was unambiguous—and the inverse of what one would expect if such races had any biological reality: The great majority of genetic variation (85.4 percent) was within so-called races, not between them.** Differences between local populations accounted for 8.5 percent of total variation; differences between regions accounted for 6.3 percent. The genetic divergence between geographical populations in the course of human evolution does not compare to the variation among individuals. *“Since such racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance either, no justification can be offered for its continuance,”* Lewontin concluded.

http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/race-finished/


&gt;""What the study of complete genomes from different parts of the world has shown is that even between Africa and Europe, for example, there is not a single absolute genetic difference, meaning no single variant where all Africans have one variant and all Europeans another one, even when recent migration is disregarded,"" Pääbo told Live Science.

For some reason one never reads about his ideology in the mainstream press, much like no westerns papers were correctly describing revolutionary Catalonia back in the day. One problem with Catalonia was that it was caught between two versions of statist ideology that both saw Catalonia as a threat to their power. With Rojava there is no Stalinism to crush it from within. Al though the arab ""cold war"" imperialism poses great problems for the region.

PR-wise democratic confederalism is also very good because it presents revolutionary ideas in a framework of promoting extreme democracy instead of promoting violent revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat. Democratic confederalism really seems to me like the a somewhat realistic solution to the Syrian-Iraqi civil war. No stable states are going to emerge from the rubbles of that war unless they are totalitarian. The ideals of Rojava should somehow be spread to other parts of the region and not just be a Kurdish thing. When (if) the Islamic state collapses wouldn't this ideology be appealing for those left? Better than to be dominated by Iranians or Saudis at least.

I really think that leftist political energy should go into promoting this idea, even if it's possibly not viable in the west. The ideas of self governance could be very appealing to the masses in Europe if the EU collapses (as many respected analysts think). Not necessarily creating a utopia, but promoting decentralized version of democracy where worker control is re-established. I don't believe the ideologies of nationalism can be successful in the long run.

As liberal, market orientated, internationalism fails, the alternative could simply be liberal, worker orientated communal-ism.

Less than 0.00001%? Are you serious?

Yes. You need proof. I'd think that's a given, wouldn't you? If there's evidence of us bombing countries because of individuals Christian roots, please, again, *show me*. If there's not evidence, it's probably not rooted in Christian beliefs.  You can't just say ""there is"" without any sort of proof and just expect everyone to believe you. Now you're ghost hunting.

Please explain how I've misused any sort of statistic.

    * Maori culture is special because its *pure* and *spiritual* and *natural*
    * It's disrespectful to criticize Maori culture, even if it e.g. discriminates against women in some situations.
    * You can't borrow from it.
    * The only way to define the Maori-European relationship is as victim-oppressor.
    * Maori culture will save Anglos from their modern ""civilised"" decadence.

I think, if we want to promote Maori culture, it's a good idea (and probably pretty fun) to have classes that allow students to come into contact with it, but it needs to be done in a way that allows dissent and playful imitation and doesn't dwell much on protocol, taboos or spirituality or on differences in worldview. It also must allow for some discomfort from students. They should teach music, art, kapa haka and read legend and myth (as well as use it to explore the deep undergirding of Maori culture in a relativistic way), but I don't think that deep philosophical ideas should be taught as an end in themselves, and protocol should be taught in the same casual way table manners are taught in foreign language classes. 

Often when you take cultural immersion courses when learning a foreign language, you are told that being culturally literate and forming intercultural links isn't about adopting the other culture's worldview but getting what you can/want to out of your exposure and finding the middle ground where you can.

&gt; A UEFA somente corroborou o CA. A UEFA não deu opinião directamente sobre os lances porque disse que concordava com a decisão da CA. A CA decidiu que o lance do pizzi não contituia infracção e que o lance do semedo era difícil e de dúvida.

VOLTO A PEDIR, mete aqui a decisão da UEFA! Só para ver o ridículo disto, sabes sequer que pergunta foi feita à Uefa? Não sabes. Vamos supor que a Uefa disse que o Pizzi não fez penálti, sabes se a pergunta era relativamente à 1ª mão ou incluía a 2ª mão? Se me perguntarem sobre a 1ª também digo que não há penálti, mas como diz o próprio BdC não se sabe como foram colocadas as perguntas, só se conhece a resposta.

E o próprio não refere que lances que foram duvidosos isso é uma extrapolação de uma fonte qualquer que ninguém sabe quem é... curiosamente não vem cá para fora a decisão e as perguntas enviadas. Porque será? Não podiam já ter publicado o conteúdo se dão assim tanta razão ao árbitro?

&gt; Pelo meio, ainda foste falando títulos e notícias enganadoras. Pegando também em frases do BdC como ""há um lance que não consegue descortinar"" como se isso significasse de algum modo que a UEFA nem viu ou analisou os lances. Ainda há pouco a palavra sozinha do BdC era lei, agora passa a ser necessário ver a UEFA comunicar directamente que viu os lances, quando mais do que um jornal diz que a UEFA deu razão ao CA e o próprio BdC diz o mesmo, achando mal claro.
Vejamos então, dizes isto: ""o que está em questão é uma notícia dizer uma coisa que simplesmente não é verdade""
Vou contrapor isto com quotes do artigo do expresso e do BdC: Título da notícia: ""UEFA dá razão a Jorge Sousa nas decisões do dérbi"". BdC: ""UEFA jogou a favor do árbitro e da equipa com que jogámos"".
Corpo da notícia: ""A organização que rege o futebol europeu analisou os lances e teve o mesmo entendimento do Conselho de Arbitragem em relação às decisões do árbitro do dérbi de Lisboa."" Artigo: ""A pedido do Sporting, o Conselho de Arbitragem questionou a UEFA sobre os lances. Esta terça-feira, a UEFA deu razão ao Conselho de Arbitragem"".
É preciso dares umas voltas valentes para interpretares isto de alguma forma diferente da que está explicita na notícia tanto do Jogo como do Expresso.

Só te vou deixar aqui a entrevista do BdC para ouvires as palavras directamente e perceberes que é como te estou a dizer e não por esse isolamento de frases para tentares ter razão, a partir dos 55s:

A pichação é um problema com raiz na desigualdade social e econômica.

Two of them were confirmed skinwalkers from personal experience, and one of them seemed to be involved with the creation of the ones that weren't traditional skinwalkers.

As far as the issue with using the word ""skinwalker"" to refer to any shapeshifting person that has multiple animal forms, the issue with most of the other words (from an english speaker's perspective) is that they're either too specific as to the type of thing they refer to (e.g. werewolves) or they're in a language other than english.  I wasn't saying calling them skinwalkers (which, as I stated in my previous comments, is already a deviation from their original name, and as such allows greater flexibility with its usage because it's not inextricably associated with that one specific culture) was the best course of action, merely that everyone else is doing so, and as such trying to be pedantic over it when the differences are subtle is akin to trying to bail away the rising tide with a teacup.  

Now another part of why I'm comfortable with calling the ones I saw in Missouri skinwalkers is there is obvious influence from the Navajo skinwalker in both how they behave and how their powers work, but there are also influences from european werewolf lore as well as other native tribes' lores pertaining to communications with nature spirits.  Objectively speaking the ones I dealt with in Missouri seemed to have access to greater amounts of power than the average Navajo skinwalker, but were also seemingly more stable.  

They don't fall under any one description from prior lore, but seem to have been made by somehow cherry-picking aspects from other shapeshifting gifts and curses in some manner to create an altogether more powerful living weapon.  

In fact, the one guy that I know with 100% certainty was a Navajo skinwalker was a small fish in a really big pond, to where he feared coming to where I lived when I'd hang out with his son because my house straddled the territories of at least three different Missouri skinwalkers, one of whom seemed to be at the top of the hierarchy for the entire group.  I honestly just have nothing better to call them.  Their powers are confined to pelts, they actually transform instead of being merely a dude on performance enhancing drugs with some decent special effects training, they are _social_, not just with each-other, but with the rest of humanity as well, and they're seemingly able to gain this ability with less crimes against humanity than the Navajo skinwalker.

However, if there's one market where house was/is a more prominent genre... it would be Chicago, so I can see why it'd be very likely to see it there.

t5_2cneq,1488488965,False,1485999774,,dd7sfdo,"&gt; Just because a person came to the US for college and ended up starting a family there and became a citizen through legal channels does not mean that that immigrant should be presumed guilty of using a ""backdoor"" into the country.

I realize that what I'm pointing out to you here strikes a nerve, but it is because you have a conflict of interest on the matter.  It is not my intent to offend even if you are taking exception to what is revealed.

If you are offended by what I pointed out about the misuse of the foreign student visa program in the U.S., take it up with those who misuse that program.  I merely pointed out the intent and purpose for that longstanding visa program.  In no way, shape or form am I or any other American responsible for those who misuse that program as a means to circumvent the legal immigration path that has long existed in the U.S.  

Think about this behavior another way.  Morally and legally speaking, is a person innocent of committing fraud if they use the benefits derived from their initial crime to benefit themselves and their family years later?  Not according to international principles of justice.  It's why international courts forced Germans and Swiss bankers to return assets they had taken from other Europeans during WWII.  Were many of these people ""upstanding citizens"" at the time the courts compelled them to return what had been taken?  Yes.  So, as you can see, being an upstanding citizen does not automatically erase one's past crimes.

&gt;I find it interesting that you accuse me of conflating legal immigration with overstaying a visa, since it's quite clear that you are doing exactly that...

I didn't accuse you of anything, but I did point out a common practice and problem with the misuse of the foreign student visa program.  I stand by what I wrote because this widespread practice has been known for a long time.

&gt;...attracting smart, hard-working people to the US and allowing them to immigrate is pivotal if the US wants to stay at the top of the academic and economic food chains.

We're in general agreement on this observation.  The problem is that the business community and special interest groups have pushed this practice too far.  Hence, the problems I raised.  I don't take exception to you or your family per se.  Instead, I take major exception to the systemic economic disenfranchisement of most Americans...a group of people that you and your family happen to be a part of in this country.  Understand?  The people I am critical of on this matter compromise our collective interests, REGARDLESS of ethnicity.  Legal immigration is not problematic, but illegal immigration in all of its forms IS a major problem.

&gt;""Illegal"" immigration is a scapegoat here. The real source of the blowback is that immigrants are coming to the US period.

There's a term for this opinion...confirmation bias.  Take the racial chip off your shoulder because it has blinded you to the objective economic and fiscal metrics/trends which soundly refute what you want to believe.  My opposition to illegal immigration is solely based on that objective evidence.  

The fact of the matter is that illegal immigrants create more social costs than their fiscal contributions overcome.  This wouldn't be an issue if we were talking about a few thousand people.  However,  given that we're talking about 11-20+ MILLION people, that's a different matter altogether.   You can argue until you are out of breath that this is a racially-charged issue alone, but the objective  evidence I'm pointing out to you soundly destroys such beliefs.  

Since *you* threw down the race card, racism is most definitely part of the illegal immigration debates...on *both* sides of this debate.  Bear in mind that racism is not limited to WASP's alone.  It is found in Asian-American circles along with other ethnic groups too.  I point this out as someone who grew up in a multicultural environment and witnessed such bigotry across the socio-economic spectrum.

&gt;despite the fact that current US citizens do enjoy a leg up against immigrants in many ways, any case of an immigrant ""making it"" in the US makes people like you lose their cool, even if those immigrants didn't do anything wrong.

First, your initial assumption is flat wrong given that U.S. workers have been increasingly discriminated against by the business community in favor of foreign workers in this country.  Second, I'm financially independent, so you can shove that xenophobic accusation where the sun doesn't shine.  I don't have a single xenophobic concern when it comes to immigration issues.  By the way, that unfounded accusation is your racist bigotry talking, not mine.  You're projecting racist character flaws I don't share.  Finally, the moment any immigrant violates or games U.S. Immigration laws, they have done something wrong.  Your personal desire to condone that form of fraud does not justify or legitimize it.

&gt;...how exactly do you suggest a 26 year old Medical student goes about reforming ""third world/emerging market socio-economic structures?""

Good question.  I'm glad you asked.  First, I assume your family has political connections in Bangladesh, given their charitable work.  Correct?  Assuming this is the case, it would give you a foot in the door that others would not have to effect the sorts of changes I referred to previously.  Second, do you know anyone with similar connections and background who is educated in economics, specifically ""saltwater""/Keynesian economics?  If so, they can help fill the knowledge gaps you would need to bridge to help implement the sorts of meaningful reforms that would lift Bangladesh and its people up in a meaningful way.  Keynesian economics made the U.S. middle class and consumer market possible.  Just as it worked for the U.S., it could also work for Bangladesh.  How do I know this to be true?  It was the economic path that India and, yes, China pursued to turn their economies into emerging markets.  How's that for a ""narcissistic, xenophobic, anti-immigrant racist"" observation?  If your suspicions were sound, you would have never gotten that sound advice.

I want to touch on your basis for favoring immigration as a solution because it is a subject I am all too familiar with after my family left the U.S. in pursuit of a better life.  Talk to your father about the personal sacrifices he endured upon coming to the U.S. When one leaves behind family and friends to pursue a better life, they lose something that no amount of money can replace...the time and life experiences they would otherwise have with those that mean the most to them...their family and friends (i.e., grandparents, parents, uncles/aunts, brothers/sisters, cousins, childhood friends, etc.).  This loss is one of the reasons I favor making sure that people don't have to leave their homes/countries to be able to provide for themselves and their families.  The only people who claim this isn't possible are the oligarchs who favor pitting global workers against one another and disenfranchising the vast majority of them in the process.

t5_3fuwj,1488489080,False,False,Non-Trump Supporter,dd7smd6," These are my current thoughts as I try and navigate my way to my final opinion on globalism.

Does globalism reduces the chance for war? yes, when nations are tied together economically, the act of war becomes a self inflicted wound. Stability is a by product of webbing economies together, the UN was founded to prevent another Hitler by tying europe together.

Does globalism help the countries that take part in it? Depends. if you're a wealthy CEO within the country that has the most leverage, then yes absolutely. From that advantageous position you can reduce your cost of labour greatly by moving it to the poorer nation. The deal struck, would be more jobs in the poorest country with those jobs being removed from the wealthier country. The payback is that the wealthiest nation will now get those services (like manufacturing) at a much discounted price. It's almost like a portion of the population is sacrificed so that the rest can live a slightly better life and a small group gets rich(er). So if you work one of the sacrificial lamb jobs, then it is soul crushing. The TPP as it was structured would have decimated service industry and medical jobs the same way it has manufacturing (I'm glad it's dead, there are a lot of nurses in my family that would have been out of a career)

Is globalism needed? To some degree, absolutely. Resources are not evenly distributed on earth, nor are certain habitats suited to produce certain goods, but it could be scaled back a lot or at least restricted to give those people who would lose jobs some way back to normal life, but that would require the people who write these treaties to care about others.

There is one other need for larger trade agreements, they are also the weapon of the post nuclear age.

&gt; LONDON - Britain moved closer to leaving the European Union Wednesday as lawmakers backed a bill authorizing divorce proceedings and kept alive the government&amp;#039;s plan to trigger Brexit talks within weeks.

&gt; Lawmakers also defeated a &amp;quot;Wrecking amendment&amp;quot; proposed by the Scottish National Party that sought to delay Britain&amp;#039;s exit talks with the EU because the British government has not disclosed detailed plans for its negotiations.

&gt; The government wants to have the bill approved by early March so it can meet a self-imposed March 31 deadline for triggering the EU divorce talks.

Also, comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and his administration to the Holocaust is basically taking for granted the suffering and the disgrace that millions of Jews and Europeans had to go through. It's quite offensive to Jews, to be honest. No other time in history was as disgraceful and terrible as the Holocaust.
