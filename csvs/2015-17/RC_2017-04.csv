t3_62ou08,t5_2s7m6,"Industrial Engineering is a ""top level"" science. What I mean by that is that you approach problem solving from the ""32,000 ft"" point of view. The degree teaches you how model and analyze systems, as well as impact the system to work for you. If that sounds broad, it's because it is. ""System"" can range from classical manufacturing applications,  all the way to extremely complex medical applications. Here's the catch; most systems are described using either Stochastic (statisical), Linear Algebraic, or Computer modeling methods. So be ready for a lot of drrrrryyy classes, that won't teach you how to save the world; it teaches you how to think, so that you can. 

Once you get the basics (after you've taken Op. Research, Matrix Linear Algebra, and some Empirical Methods class) you start seeing from the systems pov, and imho the applications are endless. One ""better the world"" application I can think of off the top of my head: Refugee Crisis in Europe. Using a Poisson Process or some other stochastic model, you can model how many refugees to expect on a periodic basis. Given that sort of information you create an Optimization model to fairly (subjective to restrictions on the model via the various inputs of the countries) distribute them amongst the countries. There is also a fair bit of computer applications, particularly for discrete simulations. I know that's some vocab, but I'm hoping you'll research it to learn a little bit.more about the major!

&gt; By Russ Read. A Swedish investment company is using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin to avoid U.S. financial sanctions, allowing investors to invest in the economy of one of the world&amp;#039;s foremost sponsors of terrorism.

&gt; European sanctions on Iran began to be removed in 2016 as part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, but Swedish banks do not allow investment in the Iranian economy because of U.S. financial sanctions, according to Johnsson.

&gt; &amp;quot;However, due to U.S. financial sanctions still in effect against Iran, none of the Swedish banks wanted to help us - despite there being no relevant sanctions against Iran in Sweden or the European Union stopping us.""

t1_dfobtvz,t5_2qh13,"The honest answer is no citizen REALLY knows whats going on, only rough guesses based on what politicians and intelligence figures have stated... there were documents the FBI had that stated Russia helped Trump in his election. Its unknown how much because those documents have never been made public to my knowledge. However the best ""fair"" assessment i've heard stated that Russia likely didn't go so far as to rig voting booths but was involved with leaking the scandals around Hillary, and slowly leaking them so as to hurt Hillary's chances of winning around the time of the election. Which in my opinion they did, but then again the intel community consensus also stated that russia never actually thought Trump would win either, and just wanted to stir shit up never imagining it would actually work that well. 

That catches us up to the election but what about after. Well because the top intelligence agencies discovered that Russians aided Trump at least slightly the question then was what ties does Trump and his administration have to Russia if any... basically does the conspiracy go further. Turns out it kind of does... Several of the Trump staff had undisclosed direct ties to Russian diplomats, Banks, and some even have direct ties to Putin. But in many of these instances it wasn't like it was a crime directly though it could be argued to be morally wrong to not disclose it (however there are a few exceptions where it might very well be CRIMINAL to not disclose their ties, but with the judicial system in this country favoring the super rich don't expect any of them to actually face a trial anytime soon). 

So as more and more Russian ties come out around Trump suspicion has of course mounted because the Left hates him unconditionally (which is wrong in my opinion) and even portions of the Right are looking at these ties closely and are honestly scared by them and unsure how to react. 

Which leads us to Flynn... Flynn is just the latest event to occur from the continual fall out and investigation. Its currently unknown how much he knows or if he ACTUALLY knows anything on the Trump/ Russia ties... The Left of course is hoping that Flynn can be a final definitive tie to Russia which could in there mind get Trump impeached. While the Right thinks Flynn knows nothing and the media is just making it up... 

Somewhere in the Middle are the skeptics that wonder if Flynn is just in it for something illegal he did that he doesn't want to be prosecuted for, and is using the Trump / Russia ties in the hopes of being granted immunity before whatever it is, is found out. While others think he might know something small but still won't be enough to prove a direct conspiracy. 

Lastly i want to leave you with another idea that someone mentioned to me. Since Russia at least slightly helped Trump get elected, Its possible that they now seek to make Trump as ineffective as possible by playing up their ties. In so doing, they might be inadvertently using the media so that they can take advantage by some sort of power play in Europe while we are distracted.

Its unknown if the above is true, but that theory is just as solid as anything else i've heard on the subject. I recommend coming to your own conclusions though, have a good one.

t3_62no3r,t5_2rxrw,"Not sure this entirely counts but I went to Cuba in the summer with my family and we were told we would be given a private driver and an English speaking tour guide. This didn't happen. We got a (very lovely, very accommodating, and very much like family by the end of the trip) taxi driver who spoke no English. When we were leaving Havana to drive around the country a bit more, he brought his nephew along as he spoke English -- He actually spoke very little English, but with broken English, Spanish, and French from him and I, we managed to communicate fairly well. I constantly talked to him on behalf of my family, and he would talk to me on behalf of our driver, we ended up being sort of interpreters? It was memorable to say the least. 

But it was incredibly chaste and never really developed into anything beyond a hug and a kiss on the cheek when we were saying bye to each other. It was very shy, cute, and awkward. He was an absolute gentleman, offering me a hand whenever I was getting out of the car, or helping me walk over rocks when we went hiking (I didn't actually need the help... but I wasn't going to turn down holding his hand a bit.) It was actually quite funny because he didn't offer any of this help to my sister... 

One of the last days we were in Cuba, we went to the beach, and me and this guy ended up sat in the ocean for about four hours just getting to know each other. Turned out he was 30, whereas I was 21 at the time -- He looked about 23? 24? But it was awkward because my parents kept coming down to check on us, and his uncle did too... So there was never really the opportunity for anything to happen.

It was more of a holiday crush kinda situation, but it was nice. My friends still tease me about it to this day, because I never pursued anything with him. All I know about him now is that he's working on a cruise ship around Europe. Never really had the chance to maintain contact with him -- plus I have a boyfriend now, so it might be a bit awkward.

If there were a spate of dog attacks worldwide, all by pitbulls, and the CBC covered up the breed of attacks in Canada to prevent prejudice against pitbulls, is that responsible reporting? Is that concealing information from the public that puts them at risk? Is that not the opposite of the mandate of the press?

CBC has now attempted to cover up two mass sexual assaults in swimming pools by Muslim immigrants in Alberta. One in Lethbridge, one in Edmonton.

The tweet I linked above proves they're doing it on purpose.

They don't want to expose a worrying trend we've seen explode across Europe that goes against the narrative of the political party that gives them the most money. This is why they must be defunded, as they are simply a political apparatus.

""But the likely explanation for the pigmentation genes is to maximize vitamin D synthesis, said paleoanthropologist Nina Jablonski of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), University Park, as she looked at the poster’s results at the meeting. People living in northern latitudes often don’t get enough UV to synthesize vitamin D in their skin so natural selection has favored two genetic solutions to that problem—evolving pale skin that absorbs UV more efficiently or favoring lactose tolerance to be able to digest the sugars and vitamin D naturally found in milk.""

The article acknowledges that ""evolving pale skin that absorbs UV more efficiently..."" but does not address the fact that Neanderthals ventured into Europe 300,000 years ago. And Homo sapiens around 40,000 years ago. So all these years of living in Northern latitudes and not getting enough UV to synthesize vitamin D.

 Literally every faction we've seen beside's Satine's are not pacifists. The Protectors, Death Watch, Imperial Supercommandos, etc. You're also forgetting that it took decades for Legends to flesh things out too. Give it time, more mandalorian stuff will come.


&gt;The name Mandalore may have came first during the creation of Boba Fett, but the culture and basically everything about them didn't come around until after ESB, so yes Mandalorians and their cultural attitudes sprung from Boba Fett, to tie in with his backstory.

They didn't though. Boba at *some* points was relate to Mandalorian stuff(particularly later on when Traviss ruined him) but really there isn't too much relation between how they were developed and how Boba was. Much of the way Mandalorians functioned came from the *Tales of the Jedi* comics(until Traviss came along and ruined them).


&gt;What is interesting about him (AKA: Jango dad) just being a regular bounty hunter with some other people's armour?

Because it offers up questions. Why does his dad prefer Mandalorian armor? Where did he get his from? How did he get it? Where and how did Jango get his?

&gt; It means nothing. They may as well have been Dengar. They have no unique moral code or attachments to a culture, they're just dudes.

Why does it need to mean something? Why do they need to have a ""unique moral code or attachments to a culture""? They're bounty hunters. They work for the highest bidder. That's all they've ever been. It doesn't matter what crazy stores the EU created for them. They're bounty hunters.

&gt; If them being clones of each other is what's interesting, then I have to disagree as well, as it only makes things more complicated. 

Being a clone is part of what makes Boba interesting. He's a clone of the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, and after his father dies he is trained and brought up by some of the other greats. 

&gt;Also them being clones from Mandalore, and them being clones wearing Mandalorian armour aren't different enough to be interesting.

Hillary Speech to American Legion, August 31, 2016: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfm4unbyHV0

She mentions how bad Russia is (relating to the purported email hack), and then goes on to say:

&gt; ""As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyberattacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and **military responses.**""

Here's a [The Hill article about her speech](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/293970-clinton-treat-cyberattacks-like-any-other-attack).

Even a [Huffington Post writer agrees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/a-vote-for-hillary-clinto_b_11879812.html) that she wants war with Russia over both the email scandal and the middle east fiasco (both of which are partly her fault, which makes this even worse).

Hillary has also supported a no-fly-zone in Syria, which would lead to some more contentious geopolitical conflict.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53

Not only is it very clear that she wanted war with Russia, her purported presidential policies would take us in that direction too.

&gt; Wanting to discourage a hostile foreign nation from meddling in our internal politics

Yes, she wants to discourage Russia with political, economic, and military responses (as well as no fly zones). Discourage by war, as I said earlier. The worst part about all of this is that her hatred towards Russia is all *personal*. The Podesta files were a character assassination towards her, and she blames Russia. As secretary of state, she had a hand in the Arab Spring fiasco and subsequent European Migrant Crisis; she blames Russia. 

That would be like Trump threatening Japan as President because a few years ago he didn't like some business deals on Trump hotels or something; completely personal, and shows terrible authoritarian leadership.

t1_dfodw2t,t5_3icow,"&gt; CBC has now attempted to cover up two mass sexual assaults in swimming pools by Muslim immigrants in Alberta. One in Lethbridge, one in Edmonton.

Did you actually read the article? The question being used to promote it in the tweet isn't coming from the CBC. It's coming from one of the Edmonton groups working to resettle Syrian refugees, which is concerned by the response to previous media coverage of this crime. Concern that's also shared by a Christian organization doing the same work. How is CBC ""covering up"" anything when they also reported on this crime?

The tweet used to promote the article might be a bit clickbait-ish, but you're trying to grossly misrepresent it to push an obvious political narrative of your own.

&gt;They don't want to expose a worrying trend we've seen explode across Europe that goes against the narrative of the political party that gives them the most money. This is why they must be defunded, as they are simply a political apparatus.

t1_dfn7bkx,t5_2qh4j,"I have a simpler theory. 

1. Consumers love stuff. They love the idea that they have more money to spend on stuff than they have actually saved or earned.

2. Establishment politicians love power. In a democracy, establishment politicians have to give consumers/voters the idea that all is well in order to get or keep power.

3. From late 2007 until around 2010, there was a global economic crisis. This crisis lasted a little longer in Europe than elsewhere (until 2012-2013) due to structural problems with the European Union and the fragility of its demographically stagnant, largely saturated, high-debt economies.

4. Now we're on a global 'up' again, though it is only temporary as are all economic movements in the current cyclical system. In any case, there is 'wiggle room' for borrow-and-spend politics again (not just for politicians, but for households as well).

5. Therefore, politicians (both national and supranational) can give voters the idea that ""we're looking out for you guys, you have more money to spend now, things are looking up, go raise your mortgage and invest in a new kitchen for your house and a new car for your driveway"".

The European Union wasn't saved this round by Donald Trump or Brexit. It was saved by the global economic cycle finally lifting its beaten body up for a while again. But: consumer debts are extremely worrying, some major European banks are extremely fragile, and all it takes is a moderate global economic downturn for things to turn very ugly very quickly.",2,Cativellauni,europe,False,0,True,,t3_62k1tq,False,dfog0dc,1491014696,,,0,1493696848,

&gt;Except, that is without factoring in any new Switch systems sold in the west in the last two weeks. Seeing as Nintendo has stated they are breaking sales records in the west every day, as recently as last week, MCV has determined that the 2 million goal has been surpassed thanks to western sales. They note that the driving force was Zelda which as of mid March, was purchased by 89% of owners of the Switch.

Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

I hope this helps you make your world record since it will get soooo many people trying to prove it wrong as long as it is upvoted.

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

t1_dfoe78i,t5_2thqg,"&gt; Your response is all over the place, and I've been drinking. I will try to respond to it, but if I fail to hit certain points, feel free to point them out to me.
&gt; 

Indeed. I edited it out cause I wanted to think about it. It was a very reactionary post.

&gt;Don't confuse this with ""Western values"".

Mhm. I mention it cause it was the most recent time, off the top of my head, that there was a stated intention of actually planting the seeds of those values in a nation.



&gt; but I also understand the establishment's motivation for pushing it through.

Oh, the establishment's motives are not unknown or necessarily unreasonable, they merely involve realist -and thus sometimes ugly-incentives rather than liberal ones is the point.

&gt;Europe, still in recovery after WWII has been struggling to point the finger at others when it comes to breaching human rights. I think this is because of our history of wars and violence.

Maybe there is a moral relativism problem, I just tend to lean on the side that the reason Europe doesn't get dragged into things is not cause of moral relativism but because it's *inconvenient* to their political goals. PM David Cameron for example made a similar pragmatic argument about the Saudis as you did, he didn't say ""the Saudis culture is as nice as ours"" It's better to just...carry on and not care, beyond a few words from departments here and there. It's not done cause people in Leftist departments are taught to share the talking stick with people that would hog it, but because it costs less, in the eyes of the people making policy (though obviously in democracies leftists help drive policy)

That's the crux of the issue: If that explanation is the correct one, then the problem is much deeper. If it isn't and it really is moral relativism that's relatively easier to solve. People can just wake up from the fever dream. If it is about international interests then...well, changing those is harder than changing yourself. 

That is the question here; difficulty. That doesn't mean that changes still shouldn't be made but it does affect how hard you think certain changes will be to get.

(Europe has pointed fingers of course, at Milosevic and Ghaddafi but I don't know where you'd rank those in terms of size and impact.)
&gt;Europe has been pushing a middle ground where every idea can live together, but this is simply not achievable, if we are to judge by evidence so far.

&gt;I don't support Trump, and I don't know where you get that idea from in my post.

That wasn't about you. That post went through like six edits and so things may have been left out. It was originally part of a tangent about people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali who cherrypick what they want from people like Trump and defend it, providing cover for the actual person.

The point being that the problem with intervention is that you don't always choose your allies *or* your leaders, and their intentions may be markedly different from yours or just tainted, just as Trump's stated ones are (hopefully) different from Ali's. So, one has to be very careful about the allies you pick in these battles.


&gt;The Rwandan genocide is just about the most influential incident for our senior politicians today. This is the reason (in addition to the ""success"" of the Bosnian war) why so many of the Western leaders believe in interventions. Not sure why you would even bring that up as a counter argument against ""neo-cons"".

It wasn't against neo-cons. It happened on Clinton's watch.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

I'd say some of them are coming close to the North Korean stuff that's been spread around the internet. I have family from both areas and visit every other year or so (they are Han). Xinjiang is probably one of the most beautiful places with some of the best food you can find in the entire China, but in recent years, you can feel the tension when you're visiting. 


One of the biggest issues is how China is forcing integration on the minorities in Xinjiang (I'm assuming it's the same in Tibet) to the point that it tries to destroy their previous identity (ironic thing is, China has gone through that transformation in the last 20 years itself, I still remember all the propaganda from my childhood and this was after Deng took power where it got reduced significantly). It's also basically what many european countries are calling for these days. China actually referred to France and Belgium when they put down their ban.


Also what many westerners fail to realize, the Uighurs are a MINORITY even in Xinjiang. And western media often refuses to classify terrorist attacks in Xinjiang as act of terror, simply referring them to ""ethnic tensions"" which is angering a lot of the local Chinese.

EDIT TO ADD: Just so we can use this as a learning experiment: So there is a group of (usually ignorant, racist, white guys) who like to cite a a man named Anthiny Jackson as being the first slave owner in America, with the irony being that Jackson was black. Well, heres the thing: Jackson wasn't the first slave owner in America, be he black or otherwise. He himself was a slave who was brought to America and later gained freedom, and even prior to his arrival, the Europeans had already enslaved natives and other Europeans. So no matter what way you wish to spin it, it doesn't work. The only notable thing about Jackson is that he was the 1) First slave to become free who 2) became wealthy from 3) owning slaves as somewho was not 4) from America or Europe.

t1_dfohrzy,t5_2r5hw,"&gt; And they have to prove they can't find an EU citizen for the same job

Oh yeah, that infamous boogeyman.

Reality is different in Germany. Best candidates get hired regardless of if they're inside EU or outside, companies are willing to get through extra trouble the get the people they want.

Moreover, you might find a job already during your studies, or meet mr. Right. The amount of Canadian/British/American/Australian girls who met a German guy and got married to them and stayed that I know here is so high it's becoming a stereotype (interestingly enough, I know zero German women with husbands from the Anglosphere)",1,idkfa_CZ,IWantOut,False,0,True,,t3_62pqjx,False,dfoi04g,1491017957,CZ → DE,,0,1493697815,

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

t1_dfnqc2d,t5_2qmox,"Understand, there's seedboxes that can remedy such situations if ever considering in the future and situation (they involve a monthly fee depending on the setup). I made a brief comment about it here (will post a snippet PSA) and you can check it out to keep in mind... 

In fact, it's not so uncommon to get a few friends to chip in together to that monthly fee (USD equivalency to ~$10-$50/month with varied storage and bandwidth options). You can pay by bitcoin by the month, change plans, and then download the content as you wish via FTP/SFTP. Obviously, only 1 person's torrent account can be linked to that seedbox but you and others can privately connect to it and download without a problem through FTP/SFTP/other methods offered by seedbox provider.

&gt; There's a lot of options in /r/seedboxes (which is heavily filled by seedbox companies, so be cautious) - the most popular/easiest to set up are whatbox and seedhost.eu with their shared plan options... check out their subreddit sidebar/FAQs for more...

I've used whatbox and seedhost which work well with most private trackers... others such as bytesized, feral an ultraseedbox are popular but I'd **avoid feral** due to them being hosted in the past with OVH (when what.cd drama went down, read/search more about that in /r/trackers and /r/seedboxes). 

Within your geographic region, there might be other cheaper options but you would have to check if the tracker allows that seedbox... the tracker subbreddit might also be able to suggest ones to further explore.

But, since every reply is supposed to have at least one recommendation:

Based on your interest in stories in a *high-fantasy setting*, in which an ordinary common person *leaves their quiet homeland to see the world*, with a *basically upbeat tone*, I'll suggest Elizabeth Moon's **The Deed of Paksenarrion**.  The first volume -- **Sheepfarmer's Daughter** -- follows... well... a Sheepfarmer's daughter who runs away from home and joins a mercenary company to escape the dreadful fate of an arranged marriage to the Baker's son in her backwater of a backwater town.  She goes on to have all sorts of interesting adventures, of course.

One of the things that I really like about Paksenarrion is that the protagonist actually experiences the life of a common soldier -- not the standard story of being immediately whisked into some special high position by dint of being ""chosen"" -- and so, you get to see the life of a common warrior.  (Moon, herself, is a retired US Marine, so she knows a thing or two about soldiering, though from a different era)

Or, taking a slightly different slant on your three samples:  based on your interest in stories with *interesting magic*, and *interesting cultures* that don't just follow standard fantasy tropes, and a *basically upbeat tone*, I'll recommend to you **The Codex Alera**, by Jim Butcher.  The first volume is **The Furies of Calderon**.

I'm not sure how to describe this one for you without giving away some of the best parts, but the magic is neat (if not quite as highly detailed as a Sanderson Magic System™), the characters are fun, and the cultures aren't all based on medieval western European mythology.",4,CompletePlague,books,False,0,True,points-1,t3_62k4ss,False,dfoj6b1,1491019923,24,,0,1493698382,

Nearly all these cases were debunked by MSM. 

Now. Here's the thing:  the MSM sucks. They all spew dogshit. They're bad, they push a certain agenda. All true. But they are mostly *not* conservative.  If they were, they'd be thrilled with Trump. They mostly represent a neo-liberal orientation. They reflect the orientations of their corporate owners and the main sources of their revenue, advertisers. Those interests generally support ""free trade,"" social liberalism, international engagement. They're fine with a Bush 1, either Clinton, an Obama. Not so good with W (viewed as a buffoon) or a Trump or probably a Sanders...anyone that would upset the neoliberal consensus we've been under since Reagan started dismantling the New Deal, a project continued by every other subsequent president. 

So they're bad. No argument. 

But I am mostly concerned these days with the worldwide threat to liberal and social democracy represented by growing white supremacist populism and Russia's direct attempts to undermine democratic systems. The mobilization of reactionary populism by elites who frankly don't give a fuck and believe they will ride out any collapse of social structure due to either climate change or economic collapse, does concern me.  I worry about what kind of world future generations will live in. A large proportion of the human population already lives in dire desperation. Trump is just such a populist elite, very much in the mold of Juan Peron. 

We *know* that the Russian government (i.e. Putin) decided that their project of undermining western democracy was best served by working for Trump and against Clinton. They are doing the same thing in Europe, assisting a growing fascist movement. There are promising signs of resistance within Russia but mostly Putin has unchallenged power. I see the convergence of interests between proto-fascist Trumpists, white supremacy, international fascism, and Putin to be maybe the greatest threat to human survival since the Plague. 

So you can prattle on about the ""conservative"" media all you want. The voter fraud meme has found a champion in Trump and 10 to 1 he heard it on Fox or Breitbart. 10 to 1 the Trump guy in the video isn't remembering an article in the New York Times from 1999, but is more likely to have been exposed through the alt-right/Russian troll fake news echo chamber.

&gt; * What business, for instance, does Britain, a country of less than 70-million people - that will be much diminished when, as looks likely, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede - have in occupying a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, while India, home to over half the democratic world, does not?

&gt; * The world, I think, would happily agree: developing nations would appreciate a permanent member that shares and understands their challenges and concerns, while rich ones - irate Europeans, especially - would want the world's fastest growing economy, that will soon also be the world's largest market, to have an appropriate voice.

 **comment content**: Wow you're getting so much flak for nothing...

To give you a few answers about the French market, I started Java dev after graduating at 28k€. It was the highest pay in my small 20 people class. I'd say average was 25k. Add about 20% for a position in Paris as cost of living is insane there (must be comparable to London I guess). 

I just moved to Canada with 4/5 years of experience developing in Java, and my current salary is 1.4 times higher after conversion from CAD to euros, the cost of living being pretty much the same here. From my (relatively short) experience, if you're single, have no kids and are healthy, doing dev in north America is way more lucrative than in Europe. But that's a lot of ifs :)

t1_dfn696a,t5_2qkli,"* All those costs are a matter of opinion. 

Now we get somewhere. So in others words the figures you provide on prices are irrelevant to the point I endeavour to make.

* However, what doesn't vary is the trend that more wind and solar = higher prices.

That is your opinion which you are entitled to. I have already made comments to contrary refuting your opinion

* If you are going to dismiss any technical advice because it doesn't come from Scotland there is no point in having a debate.

There's plenty things from around the world I have varying degrees of trust in. That includes material published from Scotland; some I have some trust in, some I don't. Westminster have an undeniable track record in publishing skewed material intended to further their political objectives. Hence i regard it with scepticism. Something I will say about this debate is that even though we are clearly opposites in our political opinion, I fully acknowledge that your comments have been made in a respectful manner. I thank you for that and that you haven't slid into mudslinging, name calling and insults reflects well upon you.

* It doesn't change the fact those subsidies have to be paid by the country that hosts the renewables. At the moment that's the UK

Unless you have the gift of time travel you have little idea what the economic outlook is for the UK (with or without Scotland included in it). You can speculate and have an opinion like the rest of us but that is about it. That is since there are very few knowns and still a lot of water to flow under the proverbial brig. I was talking with someone yesterday (an Engish guy with no connection to Scotland, I don't know if he has even visited Scotland) who works in finance. He spoke of a meeting he was in where the bank strategist he spoke with cited the potential GBP 60bn fine for the UK leaving the EU, the high current account deficit domestically which is akin to an emerging market country (i.e. a country with significant growth prospects to repay the position through growth) and the Brexit impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the UK not showing yet.  He also mentioned the irrational response of markets at the moment...the inflation figure recently was higher than expected and so the currency APPRECIATES expecting an interest rate rise.  When in reality, there is almost no way the BoE will raise rates going into, or during, the negotiation. I repeat my assertion that the Westminster establishment and their cronies have an economic vested interest in Scotland. The UK has been happy to sponge resources out the UK. The sooner Scotland is away from the UK the better.

* Wind is a pretty mature technology. There aren't going to be massive falls in cost. However, that misses the point. Wind is in addition to conventional generation, it doesn't replace it because wind is unreliable. When wind speeds drop to almost nothing you need all the conventional power plants to still be available.

There will still be further cost reductions as renewable technology develops. The will also be benefits in additional investment in scale should indy Scot invest in renewables. Of course wind isn't the only renewable energy. Other technologies will be developed as crucially will technology in energy storage. I trust you are aware of what Elon Musk offered to South Australia. These technologies will improve becoming more reliable, efficient and cheaper and of course will reduce the dependency on renewables being intermitterment energy sources. The world is surging ahead in development and investment in renewable energy technologies. If I may politely and respectfully say so, your assertion that Scotland won't be able to benefit from that seems poor.

* Compare Scotland with Catalonia. Scotland has already had one independence referendum in the very recent past. Compare that with almost any other western democracy. How many have allowed independence referendums? 

David Cameron allowed Scotref1 because:-

* it would have fuelled sentiment in favour of the Yes movement if he denied the referendum
* he felt he was certain to win it
* he felt that by winning Scotref1 he could deall the Scottish yes movement a fatal blow

He showed his real colours after the result was in when he said 'the Scottish question is settled and now is the time for EVEL' (not verbatim but I am sure you know what I mean).

* You do understand that the real world isn't defined by belief, don't you? It doesn't matter what you believe, it what's true that matters. Your refusal to accept GERS doesn't change economic reality.

You do understand that the real world isn't defined by belief, don't you? It doesn't matter what you believe, it what's true that matters. Your insistence on believing in GERS doesn't change economic reality. That similarly doesn't alter the fact that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. GERS fits into the last 5 words of the previous sentence. This is where a word comes in used above, trust. The situation remains that as pointed out by Deloitte, Richard Murphy and others; GERS gives no indication of the state of Scottish economy that isn't controlled by Westminster. As reported by many journalists such Brian Taylor, GERS was created as a political tool by the Tory govt of John Major to ""undermine"" their opponents.

McCrone reported:

""It must be concluded therefore that revenues and large balance of payments gains would indeed accrue to a Scottish Government in the event of independence provided that steps were taken either by carried interest or by taxation to secure the Government 'take'. Undoubtedly this would banish any anxieties the Government might have had about its budgetary position or its balance of payments. The country would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree and its currency would become the hardest in Europe with the exception perhaps of the Norwegian kroner. Just as deposed monarchs and African leaders have in the past used the Swiss franc as a haven of security, as now would the Scottish pound be seen as a good hedge against inflation and devaluation and the Scottish banks could expect to find themselves inundated with speculative inflow of foreign funds.""

That was classified as ""secret"" by successive Westminster govts until the freedom of info act came into effect in 2005. This is a perfect example of the kind of treatment Scotland can continue to expect from Westminster. Just to be clear I am not asserting the economic situation is the same as it was in the 1970s. What I am saying is this is how Westminster treats Scotland. Anyone expects anything different from Westminster is delusional.

Re sovereign wealth funds, VAT, tax and and any other economic decisions an independent Scotland makes, I welcome Scotland having the economic levers to make those decisions. I choose that any day instead of a Te May (I know Theresa has an 'h') Bo Jo race to the bottom for a de-regulated UK where the wealthy increasingly exploit the poor. No to illegal wars. Again I understand today is not the 1970s. The Norway situation though is an example of what Scotland could have been if Scotland had been making it's own decisions. The sooner Scotland is out the UK the better.

Just a minor aside, I changed side during the Brexit debate. I was initially pro leave as there is much to deplore in the EU. Being is by far the lesser of two evils compared to being out.

'No. ""Fake news"" is real and it's not the same as propaganda. When Facebook and Google both said they were going to do something about ""fake news"" dominating their sites, they weren't talking about propaganda. Multiple countries are trying to outlaw or fine people over fake news.

""Fake news"" is very specifically made up stories from fake sources. Websites created to get clicks, mostly out of eastern Europe and Russia. Mostly websites setup to look like conservative news sites. Complete fabrications with totally fake stories designed to enrage, frighten, and get as many clicks as possible. 

They're not really politically motivated. It's just about the money. Thing is conservatives are more likely to believe and spread a fake story so they followed the money. They also do pseudoscience nonsense that hippies on the left do the same with. Both groups never fact check, they get outraged or scared, and spread it. More clicks is more money. 

So, conservatives have been getting pissed about everyone saying they're spreading fake news so they point at everything else and start calling it fake news. Everyone from my crazy aunt to top level officials have shared these stories and rather than saying they made a mistake, they're fucking doubling down. They're saying it's not fake. They're saying everything else is. To act like any of that is the case is to encourage them.'  ",5,kingPLoPz,news,1491026921,1,True,,t3_62pm1j,False,dfoltga,1491024776,,,0,1493699654,

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

The fuck are you talking about? USA has regulations just like any other country.

&gt;reap all the rewards

? Taxes are actually pretty high in the US. Compared to the amount of bitching Americans do, the highest tax rate in Germany and the UK is only 5% higher than the top tax rate in the US. 

Social mobility (the ability of someone born poor to become rich through hard work, something that can be quantitatively measured) is actually higher in Europe than it is in America. So a lot of your attitude seems to be built on myth instead of facts.

I could link you sources but linked sources tend to be viewed as dubious, just google 'social mobility by country'. There are thousands of different studies, all of them place the USA below the major Euro countries and the Anglosphere.

America also has 5% of the worlds population but 25% of it's prisoners. THe highest proportion of it's own civilians incarcerated than any other civilisation in history.

To call it a land of freedom from the government, opportunity, freedom of choice, when it consistently scores below the rest of the developed world in indices like incarceration rates, social/economic/political freedom, social mobility etc... is a fucking joke. Stop perpetuating the bullshit myth.

America is relatively free from government regulations in terms of workers rights and consumer/environmental protections. Well done. In terms of the fun shit that affects individuals aka drug decriminalisation and a drinking age of 14/16. Europe wins lol.

APOCALYPSE (BRAZIL - 1983 ...)- source - Wikipedia

&gt; The progressive rock band Apocalypse was born in 1983, in Caxias do Sul, Southern Brazil, founded by Eloy Fritsch and some school friends at the Colégio Nossa Senhora do Carmo who got together for a student music contest. After this first concert, guitar player Ruy Fritsch and drummer Chico Fasoli joined their ranks, playing with the band at the Festival 1º Ópera Rock. From the beginning, they presented a very different style, compared to the other local groups. They made use of organ, synthesizers, classical vocals and created songs influenced by Uriah Heep, Yes, Pink Floyd, Led Zepellin, Rush and Genesis. From 1984 to 1988, the line-up changed several times.

&gt; In 1992, the line-up stabilized with Eloy Fritsch (keyboards), Ruy Fritsch (guitar), Chico Fasoli (drums) and Chico Casara (bass, vocals). Apocalypse was now signed to Musea, the most prestigious progressive rock label in the world. The album ""Perto do Amanhecer"" was released in France in 1995. The good reviews from abroad soon started to arrive, which led to a rise in the band's popularity and another invitation from Musea, this time for the compilation ""Le Melleur du Progressif Instrumental"". This CD was edited in the end of 1995 with several European bands and Apocalypse representing Brazil. With its baroque influences and a beautiful interplay of minimoog and guitar solos, the chosen song was “Notre Dame”. In their following album, “Aurora dos Sonhos”, Apocalypse created several progressive rock masterpieces, such as ""Do Outro Lado da Vida"" and ""Vindo das Estrelas"", both of them complex and long tracks in the best prog tradition. “Aurora dos Sonhos” was again released in France by Musea and was hailed as a great album by many progressive rock magazines around the glob. In 1998, the band was invited to play at the greatest music festival in Southern Brazil, the Planeta Atlântida festival.

&gt; After this show, they signed with Atração, a Brazilian label and released a CD entitled ""The Best of Apocalypse"", with tracks from their French CDs. To promote this CD, they decided they should tour other parts of Brazil. In April, they are invited by the Rock Symphony label and travel to Rio de Janeiro to take part in the Rio ArtRock Festival third edition, playing together with English band Pendragon at the Teatro João Caetano. One year later, in 1999, they are invited to play in the USA, at the longest running progressive rock festival in the world: Progday. This show would make history, because it was the first time a Brazilian band recorded a show in the USA for a CD release The album “Live in USA"" was released as a double CD with a CD-ROM track containing a videoclip and a gorgeous booklet with many photographs from the US trip. The CD saw the light of day in 2000 and Rock Symphony took over the distribution.

&gt; The CD “Refúgio” was released in 2003 by the Rock Symphony and Musea labels with new tracks such as “Viagem no Tempo”, “Amazônia”, “Lembranças Eternas”, “Refúgio”, “Liberdade”, “Terceiro Milênio” and the epic “Cachoeira das Águas Douradas”. As a bonus, it also includes two songs from the “Live in USA” double CD. Coming 2004, Chico Casara (vocal and bass) leaves Apocalypse, and the other musicians decide to go on with a new line-up.

&gt; Singer Gustavo Demarchi and bass player Magoo Wise are invited to join the band. Apocalypse takes on a new project: to record some of their old hits in English and also to start writing in the new language. In September 2005, Apocalypse is invited to another festival in Rio, this time the Rock Symphony For The Record festival at the Teatro Municipal de Niterói, Rio de Janeiro.

&gt; The band's concert, on September 8th, was released in DVD through Rock Symphony label together with Musea Record Company. After this show, the band made yet another appearance in Rio, in 2006, playing together with English band Uriah Heep at the Canecão as part of the Rock in Concert Brazil Festival.

t3_627yaa,t5_2qh41,"10 days is plenty of time! There's so much to see, you'll just have to narrow it down! I would certainly recommend getting an interrail pass or EU rail pass, that give you unlimited train journeys in and around Europe. When I've dont it in the past, I picked a start point eg. Amsterdam, and an end point, e.g. Berlin, and then made the rest up as I've gone along. There are so many people traveling, that you will make friends, and even the best planned trip you will find other things you want to do, detours you want to make, just by talking to other travellers. I would recommend staying in hostels, even if shared rooms aren't your thing then you can get a private room in a hostel and still benefit from meeting other travellers! Europeans are in general a very friendly bunch! 

The only thing to bear in mind if many European cities close on Sundays, I was in Geneva last Sunday, and nearly all the shops were shut, it was a bit like a ghost town, so while there will still be things to see, any Sundays you're there be prepared for a quieter day!

With regards to waiting for more vacation days, the way I look at it is you'll never have enough, you could spend 6 months travelling Europe and still feel that wasn't enough, so I say if you've got 10 days, use 10 days, you can always come back another time!! 

Places I would recommend (feel free to ignore)
- Amsterdam - No explanation required, just go there
- Brussels - there's a bar called Dellirium which was 3000 odd beers on tap - it's worth a look in
- Munich - The beer halls are fantastic
- Berlin as has already been mentioned for the music - it's also surprisingly good value
- The Matterhorn (zermatt) in Switzerland for the scenery
- Or even Venice if you can make it down that far (might be a push)m just for something a bit different!

t1_dfncuer,t5_3jf35,"&gt; Don't they have representation in the EU?
It does, but the UK is only one country and they can't dictate the laws of the EU. They will have total control of their laws by leaving.

&gt; I thought they weren't part of the Euro?
The Euro is the currency that is used in most EU countries, in the same way as the US uses the dollar. What the person was referring to is that countries in the EU are required to pay money to the EU (sort of like taxes). The EU then gives a lot of this money back to countries that need it. The exact numbers are debatable, but the UK pays in much more money than it receives (it is one of the richest countries in the EU afterall).

&gt; And wouldn't they lose money overall from the decrease in trade?
This is what the big discussion has been and it's difficult to say. The UK will be free to make better deals with non EU countries and since the UK has many historic links to countries around the world this might go well for them, but they will end up with worse trade deals with the EU than if they were a member. How it will balance out is nearly impossible to predict.

&gt; What leverage does the UK have?
The UK is a rich country with a fairly substantial manufacturing base and a large, specialised service sector. The UK also imports a vast amount of goods (meaning they buy a lot from other countries). These are all reasons that countries would want trade deals with them.",2,stoopyface,ExplainBothSides,False,0,True,,t3_62hwls,False,dfoo18y,1491029979,,,0,1493700725,

I take exception to these people saying that Scotland shouldn't have a say in it's own sovereignty. I don't care if people say they hope Scotland doesn't go, but saying Scotland doesn't deserve a say if you took the sovereignty position during Brexit is laughable.

As for the issue of sovereignty of other regions of the UK, this comes down to whether you view Scotland as a region or a country..

I absolutely think that Wales would have deserved a similar vote had they rejected Brexit in the same way the Scots did, or if there was any support for independence there.

Also Poland had no problems holding lands in which they weren't a majority themselves, like all that Belorussian and Ukrainian land, and they didn't nearly have the same kind of historical significance to the Poles as Vilnius had for Lithuanians.

t3_62nm1p,t5_2ya42,"&gt;I became depressed for a long time because I'll never be a 10/10 girl given how my face,hair color, and eye color are. And from having wide shoulders and muscles from competitive swimming. So I won't be a blonde VS model. Kind of lost motivation for everything in life because what's the point of anything if I'll never be the hottest girl around.

Men's attractions to women vary significantly.  One man's 10 could very easily be another's 6.5 and vice-versa.  Assuming that you're not abnormally unattractive, you will *never* be any specific number to a majority of guys because our scales are that independent.  Men who are at all secure in themselves also don't tend to care what other men think either.  We do occasionally care what other women think of the looks of any particular woman whom we are with, but only because you judge our attractiveness on the other women that we attract and we try and avoid limiting our options.  Mostly, we are attracted to the type of women that tend to be attracted to us.

Furthermore, we are also much more able/willing to alter our attraction cues in accordance with our conscious will.  This means that looks aren't necessarily everything to us, but *not* in in the same way that they aren't necessarily everything to women.  We *actually change the way that we think about looks* not just decide to trade one looks attribute for another non-looks attribute.  For example, women who are dull or unkind, or thoughtless (or whatever characteristics the particular man finds unattractive) actually lose physical appeal to many of us.  This will more likely be true of experienced men for whom dating/bedding ""9s &amp; 10s"" isn't novel.

Beware, though, that you may be left with the impression that all men think the same way about women's looks *because you are only thinking about a small pool of a homogeneous group of men.*  If you are, then you may actually have the problem that you describe - but then that would be one of your own making.

I make this distinction because attraction cues can get encoded to certain groups over time for fundamental reasons.  For example, I could never understand the blonde hair fetish until I went to Sweden.  Though I grew up in an area of the world and a social setting in which there are more than typical numbers of blond women that fit the stereotypical image of attractive, they were not considered any more attractive than any other hair/eye combination by *most* men, but they were by *certain groups* of men.  As I said, I had no idea why until I went to Sweden.  Usually, I don't notice blonds any more than any other hair color, and probably somewhat less because dye is a negative-attractant (repellent) to me.  In Sweden, though, I noticed the blonde women more.  While there are a plethora of very attractive blondes in Sweden, there are also a plethora of ludicrously attractive dark-haired women, and to my utter surprise more than a few stunningly beautiful black and mixed women (in Stockholm) as well.  While I still preferred the darker haired women by a substantial margin, I did notice the blonde women much more than I usually do, so I asked myself why.  I discovered that when I saw a blonde woman it made me think of the sun for a brief moment *and in far northern latitudes that's important because for a significant portion of the year you don't get to see the sun much and you start longing for it.*

Ever notice how black guys tend to like women who are curvier/thick?  Well that's not all black guys.  It tends to be more true of black guys descended from West African and Central African ethnic groups than it does those from Eastern and Northern Africa.  It's a cultural thing - just like the blonde hair is for Northern Europeans, and there are reasons for it.

Don't let a specific culture's beauty standard ruin your life because you don't fit it.  That's dull and not particularly thoughtful - two things which are certainly unattractive.

t3_62r6zd,t5_3ffci,"The claim that the state owns all the land in the country (therefore everyone must follow their commands) is a common way to support the implicit social contract theory. 

&gt;We may instead focus on whether the state in fact owns all the territory over which it claims jurisdiction. It if does not, then it lacks the right to set conditions on the use of that land, including the condition that occupants should obey the state's laws. 

[...]

&gt;For illustration, consider the case of the United States. In this case, the state's control over ""its"" territory derives from (1) the earlier expropriation of that land by European colonists from the people who originally owned it and (2) the state's present coercive power over the individual landowners who received title to portions of that territory, handed down through the generations from the original expropriators. [I don't know why he doesn't mention the settlements that didn't require expropriation]. This does not seem to give rise to a legitimate property right on the part of the U.S. government. Even if we overlook source (1), source (2), which applies to all governments, is not a legitimate basis for a property claim. Might does not make right; the mere fact that the state exercises power over the people in a certain region does not give the state a property right (nor any other kind of right) in all the land within that region.  

&gt;If we could establish the state's *authority*, then the state could establish ownership of all its territory simply by promulgating a law assigning that property to itself [...] But this is of no use to the social contract theorists, for the social contract is intended as a way of *establishing* the state's authority. The social contract theorists therefore may not presuppose the state's authority in accounting for how the social contract itself is established. If we do not assume that the state already has authority, then it is very difficult to see how the state can claim title to all the land of its citizens. And if we must assume that the state already has authority, then we do not need the social contract theory.

Not so fast there. That *is* one theory of why Neanderthals went extinct, but it's not the only one. There are more theories than there are palaeontologists, probably.  

Other theories include:  
 - Neanderthals were slow breeders and were simply absorbed by the fast-breeding humans.  
 - Neanderthals, having much denser and thicker bones, were too heavy to swim. This was a competitive drawback in post-glacial Europe.  
 - Disease.  
 - Neanderthals lived in small, isolated bands and inbreeding became a problem.  
 - Climate change. As the glaciers retreated the large prey (bison, mammut) that Neanderthals hunted became rarer. Neanderthals couldn't run fast enough to successfully hunt smaller, lighter prey such as deer. Their heavily muscled bodies were poorly equipped to cope with the heat of an European summer.  
 - Dogs. Human had the advantage of tamed wolves, Neanderthals had not.

Marxism is also based on the idea that everything that makes a person what they are is nurtured. It assumes that you can simply retrain people to be good people that work in a communist society that affectively has not even a police force. 

Far right ideology is based on the idea that everything is natural.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.
There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.
Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

Ok, English Nationalism;

The big debating problem in England right now is Immigration.

People who voted for Brexit done so because they think it will stop Immigration and deport foreigners en-masse, they are also the same people who normally vote Labour. 

---

Labour currently has a problem because half of its voters see Immigration as the main issue, these mostly are the older-working class-white-nationalist voters outside of London -And the other half are the multi-cultured/multiracial voters inside of London and also include young students in the rest of England.

The problem is Labour haven't drawn a line on Immigration and the Tories promised Brexit, so the voters switched to Tory even though Tory policy goes against their workers rights and benefits and income tax etc.

---

So English Nationalists are screwed by whoever they vote for, whatever they actually believe. They also want a hard border with the EU and Northern Ireland doesn't.

This is why no one is going to be happy with the outcome of Brexit, especially since the Tories get to singlehandedly re-write all of the Eu's laws, including workers rights laws.

This is what people mean when they say we are being walked off a cliff. 

But the main setback is getting people to stop caring about the differences in religion, accent and skin colour and start thinking economically; looking at who's really in charge and what they are doing.

---

The Tories only care about Ni because they need the DUP in the House of commons. The DUP will always vote along side the Tories and the Tories have always had a slim majority at best in the Commons 

(It only takes about 10 Tory MPs to turn against the government -maybe less depending on by-elections -and the DUP have 8 MPs who are there to back them up)

t3_62l074,t5_2qh4r,"White (the common racial term) is one of those words that is universally employed but that nobody has been able to define with total accuracy. If you stopped people on the street and asked them what, exactly, made a person ""white"", you wouldn't be very successful. Notwithstanding those people who would look at you like you were crazy and hit you with a Mathematician's Answer (""You're 'white' if you're a white person!""), you'd be bound to get one of three common ""definitions"", each of which is fallacious. 

Most people would probably say ""a person with light skin."" Really? That will come as a shock to the many Japanese, Koreans, North Chinese, and Tungus and Manchu peoples who sometimes turn up fairer-skinned than most Europeans. And how, then, do you explain the light-complexioned Arabs (who, having Semitic features, are technically of African stock) of the more northerly parts of the Middle East? Or albinos, who can be of any race but are always lacking pigmentation?


Those who respond in a more pedantic way might say ""a person displaying Caucasoid facial features instead of Mongoloid note  or Negroid ones."" Trouble is, that category would include most of the indigenous peoples of India, who are typically light-red- or brown-skinned, and in the tropical south can have complexions as black as the night. And then, on the other hand, you have light-to-medium-colored Ashkenazi Jews with their decidedly un-Aryan ""hooked noses""; or part-Cherokee American ""whites"", who display the telltale Amerindian curling incisors and elevated cheekbones. 


People for whom ""white = European"" would probably respond with something along the lines of ""a member of any ethnic group claiming political representation or national sovereignty in Europe."" Well, okay...but Eurasia is tectonically one big continent, so where do Europeans start becoming Asians? Historically, Eastern Europe has been said to end at the Ural Mountains in the north, in the Caucasus region (just beyond Ukraine) in the center, and at the Strait of Bosporus in Turkey in the south; but people's physical features do not automatically shift at these borders. And even within the generally accepted boundaries of Europe, what about the Finns, Lapps note  , Estonians, and Hungarians - all of them Uralic peoples, and thus of Asian origin (and occasionally displaying subtle Asian facial markers), and in fact were at one time prohibited from living in certain neighborhoods in the United States because they were deemed not white? What about the Gypsies note , who are usually considered nonwhite but were living as naturalized Europeans long before the modern borders of their host countries were set? What about Bulgarians, who are genetically half-Turkish? And on and on and on...



For all of the above reasons, modern-day anthropologists tend to avoid using the word ""white"" unless it is spoken or written with caveats, preferring the much less racialist terms ""European"" or (for North Americans and Australasians) ""Neo-European."" Otherwise, they would have to constantly waste time explaining ""whiteness"" with the convoluted definition of ""light-skinned people genetically linked to the westernmost part of Eurasia who are not Uralic, Roma, Bulgarian, etc.


"" Perhaps ""white"" will one day disappear from the layperson's vocabulary as well, if its use becomes too controversial and/or people come to believe that if it is wrong to use ""yellow"" or ""red"" as colorist terms, then ""white"" and ""black"" shouldn't be used either.",0,legend747,conspiracy,False,0,True,,t3_62l074,False,dfoqc1f,1491036771,,,0,1493701834,

You don't realise it because you've never experienced any other system and think a 50-60 hour work week is normal, it's not. And it's unproductive, you get diminishing returns from workers (regardless of nationality and work ethic) past 40 hours a week.

&gt;We have regulations so crap can't be filled with dangerous chemicals and pesticides. What planet do you live on?

Once again, a lot of dubious shit is illegal in the EU that isn't in the US. Favourite example is pink slime (mechanically reclaimed meat that is cleaned with ammonia and then dyed and reformed to resemble regular meat), remember that? Although it isn't in mainstream fastfood products *now*, it was during the early 2000's and it was only the public uproar that changed this. 

The thing is though, pink slime is still legal for human consumption in the US. It was never legal in the EU to begin with, so we never ate any pink slime.

Other examples are that GM foods aren't legal in the EU, many pesticides are illegal in the EU that are proven to be detrimental to the environment and people but are still legal in the US.

There are millions of examples of this kind of thing. It's one of the reasons why there was so much pushback on TTIP from Europeans, it would've brought our regulations down to your level.

&gt;Well we have them to the extent appropriate already. Maybe a little more might be necessary. I'm guessing what you really mean here is ""I'm angry that not everyone thinks the same way as I do and I want my view to be forced on everyone through law!""

... Kind of a cunt impression you're giving here.

t3_62p13u,t5_3gwfd,"Okay, so I'm from Lithuania, and I moved to London after graduating from high school, and lived there on-and-off for 2.5 years, working minimum wage jobs, so I think maybe I can offer some perspective on this.

I think that most people from Eastern Europe and Baltics who move to UK do so purely for economic reasons (aka to make money), not because they have any interest in British culture, history, etc., which explains why they form their own communities and live in their own bubbles (I've met some people who live in London for years and can't speak English... They simply don't need to!).

I think moving to another country for economic reasons always involves an exploitative mindset - you are there to get something from it, not to contribute something to it, and I'd guess that most people from my side of the world have an intention to go back home to settle down and start a family (this also means their only interest in UK's future is self-interest, it's not like their kids will have to grow up there). 

People love to make dumb arguments like ""We need immigrants! They work the jobs natives don't want to do! They add so much to the economy!"" Come on. Most of them are unskilled people who can be easily replaced by unskilled natives who need jobs. The country won't lose anything by kicking them out.

Then there's also something that you need to understand about the mentality of immigrants from this region. There's still a lot of survivalist mindset where if there's a way to exploit the system, people will exploit it (that's was the way to get ahead in Soviet times). So if for a lot of these immigrants, if there's a way to not pay taxes, they won't pay taxes, if there's a way to live on benefits while working in an illegal job, they'll do that, etc. Remember, the aim is to make money, then go home (or at least to make enough money to live a somewhat decent life which is much easier if you get creative).

UK only has itself to blame for this, though, because of it's suicidal hospitality and bizarre sense of obligation to allow anyone and everyone into their country. 

What is sad for me, though, is that if things get unbearable in UK, all these immigrants will pack their bags and leave to their countries, because they have their own countries (Lithuania is Lithuanian, Poland is Polish, etc.). Meanwhile, where will the British (by which I mean ethnic British) go? They don't have their own country anymore.

This is why I think allowing immigration is almost always a bad idea with a few exceptions (marriage, geniuses that will benefit the country, etc.). 

I'd also argue that ditching your own country to move somewhere where life is easier could be seen as treason, since instead of trying to build your own country up so it could be a better place for the next generation (like your ancestors did which is why you have a country in the first place), you just leave because ""life is hard here"". 

White nationalism is an American concept, in Europe, we have ethnonationalism, which means Lithuania for Lithuanians, Poland for Poles, Britain for the British, etc. 

You have every right to want your country to be, well, your country. I suspect that the Poles that you met that seem to be entitled to be there and accuse Brits of racism are just exploiting your national vulnerabilities (remember, survival mindset) aka white guilt. Tell them that they have their own country, Poland, which needs them. Britain for the British!

P.S. Also, keep in mind that people who go abroad to clean toilets and wash dishes and work in construction are usually of the lower class, so when you are interacting with Poles in UK, remember the sample bias, you probably aren't talking to people from the educated intellectual class.

**&lt;Just Awful&gt;** is a new guild that spawned from the cross-server community, **FailTrain EU** (https://discord.gg/2xEeJDw). 

There are a ton of reasons why someone would need a late night raiding schedule -- a job with annoying hours, an active family life -- but there is a massive lack of guilds out there to provide one. Hopefully we can help fill that void! 

**How we work:**

We raid from 23:00 to 02:00 server time (GMT+1) on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays, with Sun/Mon typically being our progression raids and Thursday being our normal clear through. Invites go out 15 minutes prior, so that we are at the boss and ready to pull from the start. 300 stat food and pots are provided in the guild bank (with members encouraged to contribute whatever possible to help out), but flasks will need to be bought by individual raiders. 

We use RCLootCouncil for distributing loot, and Discord for voicecomms, as well as general announcements, raid attendance notifactions and resource sharing.

**What we expect from you:**

If you're a newer or returning player, we expect you to have an awesome attitude toward learning Legion, learning your class and to be willing to be in a pretty hefty amount of effort into catching up. As long as you show the above, we as a guild will do everything we possibly can to help you. 

If you're an experienced raider, then patience and an open mind is useful. We care about progression and doing hard content and we are not interested in carrying dead weight, or players who expect a free ride, but we will give people more time to improve if they show that they're working on it. 

**Sounds great, where do I sign up?** 

Throw me an add on Battle.net @ Loxi#21457 and we can have a chat!

It depends. Top end restaurant are going to cost much more than a regular one. The prices are high, but our salaries are also high. Most people cook at home though, you don't eat out that much.

It's mostly youngsters who eat out a lot, and they go to some kebab shop or McDonalds/Burger King. I used to go out and eat kebab 4-5 times a week when I was in school.

This is the living expenses of where I used to live.

But honestly? I'll give respect where respect's due. The Catholics ended up not destroying structures such as the Alhambra and even kept the name Andalucia for the area around Grenada.

I don't think ""destroyed"" is thus a good way to describe it. ""Conquered"" fits better, it's literally in the name ""reconquista"" lol.

All civilizations fall at one point or another. Roman empire, Mongol empire and British empire all used to rule the known world of their time period. Yet all of them are gone.

Civilizations rise and fall and once they fall, they'll never reach their height again.

Still. Nazi Germany fell in 5 years. the Soviet Union in 70. Alexander's empire fell almost immediately after Alexander's death.

Andalusia? Despite cultural and religious differences within our nations.

Despite the Catholics beind united, supported by European kingdoms while Andalusian emirates and sultanates fought amongst themselves.

Despite not being at their height anymore.

It still took 700 years for Andalusia to fall.

It took civil wars, infighting, heavy opposition and continuous wars to conquer Andalusia.

And even so, Andalusia left a legacy of culture and art behind. A legacy of immense power and identity.

Some groups rise and fall within a few short years, others are destroyed without leaving anything of note behind.

Andalusia was conquered but it atleast left culture, science and art behind. It could've ended much worse.

And then again, today Islam is much larger in Spain than it has ever been since 1492, so who knows, maybe a re-reconquista will bring back the glory of Al Andalus.

I'm under no illusions though; Islam is not immune to capitalism and the violence of recent imperialism. 

I think it's important to note that your criticisms are levelled against contemporary Islam whereas I'm quoting the initial identifying belief systems that it brought.

A few things to keep in mind:

Speaking French is not necessarily a prerequisite. I spoke no French when I transferred, though I am taking classes now (for my own personal benefit, it is not required at work). But I also work at a large multinational company and my team collaborates with many teams in California, hence English is the official work language. So YMMV.

There is a substantial pay cut between working in the same role in Silicon Valley and working in Paris -- think maybe a 40% cut. If you want to work in tech in Paris, money is not the driving factor. That being said, it is a rewarding experience for the culture and travel opportunities. But I can't see myself staying long term here though due to the substantial difference in compensation.

Realize that Paris is a city like any other. If you've never been there's often a tendency to romanticize it and forget that it's a city that struggles with city problems -- homelessness, crime, trash, dog crap on all the sidewalks, etc. It's still a great place to live and has a lot of wonderful, beautiful things to see, but it is definitely just a city.

If you just want to move to Europe but aren't attached to France in particular, also look into London, Dublin, and Zurich, which all have strong tech hubs.

**About Us**
&amp;nbsp;

[TwSL] Twilight Souls are a former hardcore raiding guild who was top 500 back in the TBC-Cataclysm days. However since then real life has hit, and people now work overtime/have kids etc. so we just don’t have the time to raid on a 4-5 day schedule anymore. We aim to still be competitive and clear all mythic content while it is relevant while only raiding on a 2 day weekend schedule. We aim to be efficient with our limited raiding time and still maintain a very competitive raiding environment.
&amp;nbsp;

The guild is still active during the week with people regularly logging on to do mythic+, old raids and arena as they please, while we also maintain a discord server for communication out of game (or at work ;) )
&amp;nbsp;

We are currently looking to move into Mythic raiding and are looking to expand the raid team with 1-2 more strong people to complete our Roster. We are located on horde side on the Ragnaros-EU server.

&amp;nbsp;

**Recruitment**
&amp;nbsp;

At the moment we're in need of strong DPS classes who log well for their ILVL (Frost DK/MM Hunter/Elemental/Shadow Priest ideally). Higher item level is of course better but anything above 870 to start out is fine. We are looking for potential, people who log well for there ilevel who we can gear to become good mythic raiders. Old school raiders preferred, but not required!

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

It was nothing to do with the number of jobs in banking. It was to do with if banks like RBS start to fail, they'll go bankrupt on what they owe to other companies (and people who have their savings in RBS) and that'll course a domino line of other companies failing, as well as people losing their savings.

Iceland arrested bankers who had broken the law, because they had a bank scandal around the same time. In the UK, the banks weren't breaking the law, - they were just failing. We don't arrest people or employees for going bankrupt and nor does Iceland. 

What Iceland did was before the crash, the government promised that it would secure many investments in Icelandic banks - which made it a super safe location for Brits and other Europeans to keep our pensions. When the crash came, however, the Icelandic government stated that British and Dutch depositors (who were the majority of foreign depositors) would be separated from Icelandic ones and would be allowed to lose their money.

t1_dfotf4q,t5_2qt0d,"&gt;Well, I admit that this structures are traces of Arab civilization. No dispute there. But in my view, civilization consists first of all from people. I mean, some Maya temples were saved and preserved by Europeans, but we still say that their civilization was destroyed. Aren't we?

True, but what I meant was that I respect the Catholics for not destroying all traces of Al Andalus, even if they were bitter rivals for 100s of years. Not all groups were that lenient.

Groups such as the Huns, Mongolians and other's ended up destroying ancient Roman buildings.

Had it been any other group of people, the Alhambra would've been like the Ziggurat of Ur, a building that we don't know if it ever existed.


&gt;But in my view, civilization consists first of all from people

Well as far as I know, Islam never became the majority in Al Andalus... The rulers were Muslim but outside of capitals such as Grenada and Cordoba, the majority was actually Christian. Don't forget that Al Andalus was known for it's diversity, many Jews lived there in peace, which can't be said about Catholic Iberia...

The Arian Visigoths occupied Spain, they were Catholics. DNA evidence suggest that modern Spaniards actually have only a small bit of Arab and Berber DNA, which means that the population never really changed since the Visigoths. 

&gt;Yes. Did you read the essay?

It says I need an account to download it....?

&gt;My goal there was to find out what were the reasons for the fall of this particular civilization. All civilizations fall for some reason.

....And what reason did you find...? I don't have an account to download the essay, lol.

&gt;What exactly do you mean by that?

[According to Wikipedia, by 1727, Islam was ""effectively exstinguished"" in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Spain)

Yet today there are around 2 million Muslims in Spain, according to the same Wikipedia page.

That implies Islam is making a resurgence. And like I said in the other comment, every time a civilization is passed their height, they will continue to fall. Since Islam is increasing and Catholicism decreasing, this might mean that Catholic Spain passed their height - probably around 1727.

While that's true, South American and Eastern European wages will continue to rise and Western European and North American wages will continue to flatline (or even decrease) after a few more decades of global capitalism.

This will, ironically, come from Eastern European and South American game developers *undercutting* their Western European and North American counterparts on the game development side (and of course other industries). Compare the expenses of CDProjekt to Bioware... I'd hazard a guess that Bioware's future is a lot bleaker than CDProjekt's in the RPG area, even going so far to say that Bioware could easily shutter &amp; close down if enough competition in the RPG sector arose. Not just one CDProjekt competitor, but 10, spread throughout the Philippines, Indonesia, Hungary, Mexico, Brazil, and Nigeria (etc. etc.).

PETA actually cause harm to animals in ways other than killing vast numbers of pets. In many cases this is by wasting the time of animal welfare officers (in the UK at least, I must assume elsewhere too) by sending them to investigate so many made up cases of animal cruelty.  In one case a person I know very well had the animal welfare officer arrive to the farm he worked at to look around.  The AW officer was told ""Sure go for it, look wherever you want, no animal areas are locked, if you have any questions or want to see anything else, just give me a shout, I'm here but busy working preparing for a feed truck arriving.""  After a time the AW officer returned, complimented the worker on the condition of the animals (this guy was known in the company for being outstandingly good at turning around animals that weren't doing so well for any reason) and told him how sick he was on being sent on constant wild-goose chases by them. He also lamented that due to all the BS reports and time-wasting they were probably missing some genuine cases where they were needed.

""Informarse es la manera de sobrevivir a la dictadura mediatica. ¿Que pasa en Venezuela?
A propósito de Venezuela:

1. Venezuela no tiene un sistema parlamentario como los europeos.

2. Tiene cinco poderes en lugar de tres (ejecutivo, legislativo, judicial, ciudadano y electoral).

3. Contrariamente a lo que ocurre en los regímenes parlamentarios el parlamento no tiene en Venezuela la misma significación que en los sistemas europeos.

4. Se rige por una Constitución que le establece las funciones así como a los demás poderes públicos.

5. El órgano contralor y máximo intérprete de la Constitución es la Sala Constitucional del Tribunal Supremo.

6. Es de este órgano de donde han emanado las sentencias controversiales.

7. Las sentencias han sido emitidas a solicitud de recurso de interpretación sobre los acontecimientos institucionales que vive el país a partir del momento en el cual la oposición pasó a ser mayoría en el parlamento venezolano.

8. El parlamento se ha extralimitado en sus funciones, ha desviado el poder y la autoridad que como institución tiene, ha usurpado en algunos casos las funciones del poder ejecutivo y desacata las medidas judiciales tomadas con competencia constitucional para ello por el Tribunal Supremo de justicia.

9. Desde el mes de enero de 2017 el parlamento se ha declarado en rebeldía absoluta.

10. Las sentencias pretenden ordenar jurídica e institucionalmente el estado frente a un poder que desobedece al Tribunal Supremo y crea conflictos con los otros poderes.

11. En la última sentencia la Sala Constitucional ha establecido que temporalmente hasta cuando el Poder Legislativo vuelva a la normalidad algunas de las funciones de ese poder, necesarias para el funcionamiento del estado, serán asumidas por el Tribunal Supremo.

12. Las funciones parlamentarias se incumplen por omisión o por actos no ajustados a derecho. La sentencia pretende asumir las funciones que por omisión impidan el funcionamiento del estado (ejemplo aprobar inversiones petroleras con compañías privadas para lo cual es necesario un protocolo que debe ser aprobado conjuntamente por el poder ejecutivo y el legislativo)

13. La constitución está intacta, el parlamento no ha sido disuelto, hay total respeto a los derechos humanos, existe plena libertad de expresión dentro del país, la participación política es plural dentro del país, los partidos existen y hay libre acceso a la justicia.

The Alt Right has its share of autistic shitposters, don't get me wrong, but it's an intellectual movement with a diverse array of opinion. However, we're all in agreement on one thing: the need to preserve and protect white people of European descent. This was a no-brainer position that anybody would have held even half a century ago. Now it's considered grotesquely immoral because the disease of Gloablist Leftism has infected our society to destroy white identity. The Left has efficiently organized every minority group against white interests while simultaneously indoctrinating white racial consciousness out of us through the media and academia, and they've been deadly successful. The Alt Right is a pushback against our ethnic dispossession. Many will blame Jews for this, and they're not entirely wrong. Jews are highly overrepresented in organized efforts to do this, but I do think people tend to get tunnel vision about Jews. Jewish influence wouldn't be so dangerous if there wasn't some loss of racial confidence in ourselves, and I think there are many factors for this, two devastating world wars being some of the key culprits here.

Trump impeachment hearings begin and end in 2017. Before he is impeached, he signs an executive order for the US to leave NATO. Paul Ryan becomes president, who is a total doormat for big oil, defense, and pharma. He largely continues Trumps economic policies, except successfully this time. The 2018 mid-terms stop him and the US becomes stagnant. 

Another economic recession hits, causing a debt default domino effect starting in Southern Europe. Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain all default, and exit the Eurozone to mitigate the damage on other countries. A bailout package is arranged. Due to a legal loophole, Britain is obliged to pay but does not get a vote on the terms. The divorce bill goes up from 60million euros to 10billion euros. 

The 2019 EU elections are a wipeout for the ALDE and S&amp;D. The far-right and far-left make gains. The EPP reforms as the Federalist Party, and are joined by remaining ALDE and S&amp;D MEPs. Three main voting blocs appear. The federalists who win in Germany, Belgium, Finland, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, and Malta. The far-left who scrape some support from ex-S&amp;D, who win in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Cyprus. And the far-right who win in Greece, Poland, the Netherlands, France, Hungary, Austria and Denmark. Poor Brexit negotiations lead to the UK electing a hard-right pro-Russia opportunist who vocally supports the far-right on the continent. 

Reeling from economic recession, the US elects a left wing isolationist in 2020. Things go okay for them.

The recession didn't damage Russia as much as the EU or the United States, due to booming natural gas prices due to green policies in the US. Coups are staged in Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, replacing the governments with pro-Russia military states. They join the CIS, and federalisation occurs. The Commonwealth of Independent States is now a unified country. 

Turkey verbally reignites the Cyprus conflict, as the UK and US have left the island. Cyprus votes to join Greece, which Turkey claims is a violation of treaties. The peace is broken and Turkey claims a state of de-facto war. Greece and Turkey both invoke Article 5. France comes to the aid of Greece alone, but NATO breaks down as a result. The CIS eventually steps in and supports Greece and France. Turkey becomes a Russian puppet.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.
There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.
Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

## Ant&amp;oacute;nio Costa anunciou hoje a decis&amp;atilde;o do Banco de Portugal de vender o Novo Banco como uma opera&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o sem custos &amp;quot;diretos ou indiretos&amp;quot; para os contribuintes.

O primeiro-ministro assegura que a operação de venda do Novo Banco é a única solução que garante que ""não existirá impacto direto ou indireto nas contas públicas"".

António Costa explica que a nacionalização defendida por BE, PCP e PEV - mas também por várias figuras à direita - seria uma solução com grandes custos para os contribuintes, além de não reunir ""especial simpatia"" na Comissão Europeia.

Costa deu mesmo um número para avaliar o impacto que uma nacionalização do Novo Banco poderia ter nos cofres do Estado. Segundo as contas do primeiro-ministro, a operação custaria entre quatro mil a 4,7 mil milhões de euros, que o Estado teria de injetar imediatamente.

O primeiro-ministro explicou que essa injeção de capital teria de ser feita de forma imediata e para assegurar necessidades de capital atuais e futuras do banco por ser considera uma ajuda de Estado.

""Nacionalizar implicaria a injeção de dinheiros dos contribuintes"", frisou Costa, repetindo que neste negócio ""não há garantias de Estado"".

De resto, o primeiro-ministro explica que o risco fica por conta do Fundo de Resolução, que resulta de contribuições pagas pelos bancos e que não está prevista qualquer contribuição extraordinária do setor bancário para o reforçar.

Caso o Fundo de Resolução venha a precisar de mais dinheiro para fazer face às necessidades de capital do Novo Banco, o Estado fará um empréstimo, cobrando juros.

Para Costa, esta é uma forma de envolver os bancos - através do Fundo de Resolução, que manterá 25% do capital do Novo Banco, mas não terá qualquer administador, apesar de ter controlo sobre os ativos que podem expor o banco a perdas.

O primeiro-ministro garante que esta solução cumpre os três requisitos que o Governo estabeleceu para o negócio em janeiro: a continuidade do banco, que não haverá custos para os contribuintes e que fica assegurada a estabilidade do sistema financeiro.",1,PortugalBot,portugalnews,1491165605,0,True,,t3_62ss88,True,dfowrd0,1491054305,,moderator,0,1493704931,

Most European and Australian toilets are much better. Lower water levels and wider pipes with less clogging. Except the Dutch. They are just fucking weird.

t3_62ouzq,t5_2tjxg,"In many ways I think the flaws of R2 were always as TVtropes put it Franchise Orginal sin that were there in R1 as well. 

CG was always cheesy and over the top from the first episode. There were always moments that made you wonder the hell was that. Or anything zero said you knew was so over the top it was entertaining. 

The pacing was always quick from how the BK went from being just a vigilante group in episode nine to now being the biggest group and having a sub by episode 18. 

Lots of cliff-hangers that even then felt silly at times or for the sake of it. 

Moments of dramatic events undercutted by either too much melodrama, cheesy dialogue or animation. Or just being silly to take seriously.

Plot twists that came out of nowhere or felt contrived in the execution despite build up. Like the Euphie massacre that felt more for the sake of angsting Lulu and Suzaku than serving her character. 

Sometimes too much time spent at Ashford for more superfluous purposes than for plot points or characterizations reasons. 

A large number of characters not really serving much of a purpose or interest like some of Ohgi's companions. Or interesting characters killed off or not used at all like Kirihara and Dalton.

Tactics by zero that either were silly or made little sense nor explained very well.

Subplots that got cut short or were not given enough focus like the purist faction stuff, Kyoto house or the Kyushu invasion.  

In r1 these flaws were kept more in check due to the scope (being Japan alone) of events. The gritty scenes of blood and deaths giving some weight to the conflict. I.E seeing what happened at Narita after Zero's little tactic of not just dead soldiers, but civilians in the town he ended up burying.  

The believability of the Knightmare frames in R1 and the more guerrilla tactics and fighting gave it a unique touch and more grounded feel. Stopping it from feeling too gundam. 

Melodrama stuff that was more on the narmcharm than narm side.

But by R2 you still have despite the events of the last episodes of R1 the focus in japan. Loads of Ashford scenes that serve no real purpose. 

Introduction of a lot of new characters on top of the old characters coming back. The pacing more out of sync than in R1 and now full scale battles with flying Knightmares and unique gundam type units where the tech went from real robot to super robot. 

Even more zero tactics that were more over the top than ever. 

Plot twists like Marianne being in on Charles plan that came out of nowhere.  

Characters dropping like flies with little reason to care for most. 

Events like emperor rocket that really caused tone dissonance in important scenes and caused narm for many.

More telling than showing of the plot. 

The gritty feel of the deaths gone because of the timeslot change preventing it along with the changes they did to accommodate this. 

The little fleshing out we got of Britannia, CF and Europe as well. 

Meant these flaws were harder to overlook for a number of fans for R2 than R1 and it's partly why for some it suffered compared to R1.

As they wanted it to go in a different direction than where R1 had.

Just my opinion on this.

t3_62sutb,t5_3eb41,"French election race tightens as rivals campaign in south

---

&gt;* Voting intentions in the April 23 first round for the frontrunners, centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen, showed both slipping one percentage point to 25 and 24 percent respectively.

&gt;* The poll showed independent Macron had solidified his voter base, with 63 percent of those opting for him sure of their decision, up 8 points from a week ago and his highest certainty score since campaigning began in earnest in February.

&gt;* Shock election outcomes abroad including the U.S. presidential victory of Donald Trump and Britain's Brexit referendum vote have fed expectations that Le Pen's anti-euro, anti-immigration platform could sweep her to power in France.

&gt;* BVA put Melenchon's climb since a strong performance in the first TV debate on March 20 partly down to more of his natural sympathizers deciding to vote.

&gt;* Macron met with conservative and security hardliner Christian Estrosi in Marseille, part of his strategy of showing he wants to transcend the right-left divide of French politics.

May is just as 'unelected' as every British PM. She was elected by her constituents (as was David Cameron) and then elected by a majority of her party (as was David Cameron). Neither she nor Cameron were directly elected because we do not vote for a Prime Minister in a parliamentary democracy, we vote for individual MPs who belong to particular parties and then the winning party decides on a leader who is Prime Minister and thus commands Her Majesty's government.

&gt;Wilbur Ross, the Trump administration’s new commerce secretary, presided over a deal with a Russian businessman with ties to Vladimir Putin while serving in his previous role as vice-chairman of the Bank of Cyprus.

&gt;The transaction raises questions about Ross’s tenure at the Cypriot bank and his ties to politically connected Russian oligarchs. It comes amid confirmation by the FBI that it is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow to influence the outcome of the presidential election.


...
&gt;**Democrats raised questions about Ross’s tenure at the Bank of Cyprus before his confirmation, but Ross has said the White House has refused to allow him to respond to the queries.** Senator Cory Booker and other Democrats recently sent a third letter to Ross with more questions, including whether Ross had ever done business with companies that were under US sanctions. 

&gt;In 2014, the Bank of Cyprus was still considered to be in a precarious state following a dramatic €10bn rescue of Cyprus’s banking sector by the ECB and the IMF. Under the terms of the deal, many of the bank’s wealthy Russian deposit holders lost their cash and became shareholders in the bank.

&gt;Ross, who had made billions of dollars years earlier by betting on bankrupt steel mills, was known for taking risky bets. But his decision to inject €400m into the bank with other investors encompassed a different kind of risk. It put him at the centre of the biggest financial institution in a country that was widely considered to be a tax haven for Russian oligarchs, even as the US and EU were imposing sanctions on Russia. In 2014, the year he made his investment, the US State Department considered Cyprus an area of “primary concern” for money laundering (pdf), according to its official assessment.

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.
There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.
Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

Military Republic

The UNWA (Uni-National World Alliance) was originally the UAEP (United American and European Powers) but the Mongol Alliance (Russia, Asia, Africa, Middle East) began their march on the world. WWIII slugged on for 17 years with the eventual destruction of the Mongol Alliance. Instead of leaving a power vacuum, the UAEP imposed martial law on the conquered nations. The world was now under control of one alliance. Worried about any one nation taking too much, they made one world nation. UNWA kept control with harsh laws and careful watch. After the authoritarian rule, people began to want their lives back. ""UNWA-nted"" was a common slogan. This unrest was first met with heavy hands, but realizing this was the root of the uprising itself the leaders of UNWA began to make rampant reforms. They scaled back the military to nearly nothing (who was there to fight?) and installed a world police force. This was met with appreciation from most of the clamorers but some wanted more. The Freedom Sect was established. A borderline terrorist organization, the Freedom Sect have been carrying out attacks and harassing the government.

It is not just printing money though... it is a bank on the same principles as the German public bank or the Japanese, or the EU... There is no logical economic reason the UK can't have a public bank when these other countries can.

&gt;Sure but why won't this cause gigantic amounts of inflation

It is the same process as private banks, so it is no more or less inflationary than the system now, and of course it won't wreck the economy, unless you think the monetary system is wrecking the economy now.

The NIB is a fantastic policy and it is attacked by the media. For some actual information on the Labour ideas for a public investment bank you can read this;

http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/BRITISH_INVESTMENT_BANK.pdf

I doubt this was is quite realistic even for the developed world as the US gov't predicts only 15% worldwide will be produced via renewables by 2050. In generally I think aiming for 3 times that might be a realistic goal rather than no fossil fuels in the developed world by 2030. My honest hope is there are a few huge steps forward in fusion which at least in theory could provide more power than we need with minimal environmental impact - something like the USA could be powered for a decade of the top few inches of the water in the San Francisco Bay.

That being the case, not selling any oil to the developing world from reserves in the developed world because we don't want the minor environmental impact of pipelines is problematic.

The Russian regime is being cosy with and funding groups on the extreme right and the extreme left (under the rationale that the enemy of my enemy is my friend) in western democracies that have either an anti-globalist or nationalist ideology.

In addition to this Russia is waging informational warfare which Russian strategists call ""active measures"" to produce and distribute so-called ""fake news"" in western democracies with the aim of undermining public belief in their democratic processes. They aren't simply sharing an alternative point of view, they are manufacturing false propaganda and actively spreading it in the west.

They are hacking western politicians on the left and the right and selectively releasing that data they find to discredit disfavored politicians or to collect incriminating information that can be used as leverage over politicians Russia thinks it can work with. 

Their long term goal is to split the western alliance so that America and Europe are no longer united in enforcing western democratic ideals because these are a threat the Russia's authoritarian leadership. Basically this means supporting candidates that are anti-NATO (see trumps criticisms of german spending on NATO) or candidates that are isolationist.

Others in this thread have used a shipping expedition as an example. Let's say you invested £1,000 for a 1/5 share of a particular ship bound for India to get spices and return to Europe. Half way through the journey, you receive news that the ship successfully made it to India, loaded up with spices, and is now on its way home. There is still risk that the ship might sink on its way home, but the risk is now roughly half of what it was at the outset of the expedition. Let's say a new investor is now willing to buy your 1/5 share for £1,500. If you sell your share to the new investor, you make a £500 profit even if the ships sinks on the way home. On the other hand, you give up whatever profits you could have made if the ship does make it back successfully.  

A stock market is simply a place where buying and selling of these shares can be done on a regularized basis.

Further, there are brokers (think of them as middle-men) that facilitate trading.

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

t1_dfopcji,t5_2qjdm,"&gt;talk to my friend

Asking random internet strangers carries the risk of your advice being what you paid for it, but in a situation like this anonymity is quite valuable!

&gt;how to settle down

can be a sticky wicket.  If you prefer to be ""normal"" and fit in with the culture around you, the choice is probably to be *intentionally* heterosexual.  Remember that your thoughts are to some extent involuntary - but your actions are all by choice.  To a large extent, **""you are what you do.""**  If you do things that tend toward ""normal heterosexuality"" then it will tend to influence your thoughts that this is how you ""are"" and how you ought to be.  If you make a point of suppressing thoughts you don't want to have, eventually that can turn into a habit as well.

Don't take this the wrong way, and I will try to not come across like an ass, okay?  If it doesn't apply where you live, then ignore the following but it applies for at least USA and most of Western Europe:  Your body chemistry can no-kidding be the only reason you have any confusion at all!  JUST because your body is changing, you can have new and unfamiliar emotions.  When you are young and your hormones (and the hormones of all your peers) are going crazy, it can seem like sexuality is **very important** but try to understand that this is only your hormones speaking.  In most of the western world, these years of your life are not the time for you to be selecting a spouse/life partner.  Maybe a few hundred years ago that would have been the case, and you should be making additional farm laborers with your husband by now but this is %CurrentYear% and we expect pubescent persons to be students.  These are the years when you should be studying and preparing for your own future success.  Allowing yourself to be snared into any sort of romantic relationship is **a distraction** from what ought to be your primary goal in life: education.  Thinking (worrying!) about what sort of intimate relationships you should have is not even properly a secondary concern.  For now, try to focus on your studies, and on being the kind of person your parents want you to be . . . *so that they will not give you hardship for your nonconformity!*  

When you have your education settled, after either high school or college are done, your hormones will be less wild also.   You will have a better idea of what you want out of **yourself** in the future, and what you will need to do to get it.  It is possible that you will be surprised by ""finding Mr. Perfect"" somewhere in the mean time, but if you *avoid* looking for him (or her) you will be much better off *for now*.  There is a time to be a sexual person.  You haven't mentioned your age, but if you are currently going through puberty my guess is: that time is not quite yet.  **Don't** feel like you are required to settle down on one sort of lifestyle right now - you are not!  Don't let your peers or random internet strangers pressure you to make a decision.  You might change later.  If you have ""decided"" then your decision may get in the way of the normal process of maturing into who you will be.  You could feel pressured to stay whichever way you announced to the world that you are, so . . . don't announce anything yet.

t3_62t9u7,t5_39qgx,"&gt;Rather than being displaced by EU workers, one major reason was that youngsters were instead focused largely on studies, according to McHugh. Separately, employers such as newsagents now cite the cost of insurance cover and health and safety regulations as reasons why they were not offering traditional Saturday job-type work, according to Martin McTague, policy director of the Federation of Small Businesses.

Seems like capitalism is working as intended here.

Raise the pay and you'll have plenty of people (young and old) coming to work at your unskilled shitstore.

Don't target the youth so you can save some of your precious earnings by hiring people who don't realize that minimum wage means ""I would pay you less if I could"".

&gt;The absence of a substantial young people’s employment scheme could however be the rock on which hopes of engaging increasing numbers of young British workers founder. This coming week sees the beginning of the derided Youth Obligation scheme – a carrot-and-stick approach for 18- to 21-year-olds on universal credit.

&gt;Those involved are expected to take part in an intensive activity programme from the first day of their claim, be referred to training, and encouraged to take up an apprenticeship. A compulsory work placement awaits if they are not on either after six months.

And what the hell is this? ""Youth obligation scheme""? Compulsory work placement? 

Oh, wait... I see. [*Universal Credit*: Band-aid fix to ""help"" people on unemployment benefits.](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/overview) 

And then the *Youth Obligation Scheme*: Young people, aged 18 to 21, who receive Universal Credit will be required, from April 2017, to participate in an intensive regime of support from day one of their benefit claim.
After six months they will be expected to apply for an apprenticeship or traineeship, gain work-based skills, or go on a mandatory work placement to give them the skills they need to move into sustainable employment. 

So this is a way to try to get people away from the government teat and start working. That doesn't actually seem too bad.

OP's article mentions that one of the major concerns is, ""What kind of job will they force upon me, the youth?"" I'll tell you, young one. **It'll be a job that no one else wanted to do.**

Right so me saying I didnt know he was lying because she didnt defend herself is stupid. I was just supposed to magically know, or just assume the big bad white man is a liar off the bat. Truly the echoist of echo boxes you got going here. But thats SJWs for ya.

&gt; You are probably not a woman.

lol what? What kind of stupid sexist attitude is this? If women couldnt defend themselves to scrutiny then theyd have no place in public office or debate panels or anywhere they would be directly questioned or opposed. And Im idiotic...

&gt; You're also a piece of garbage.

Nice point, please, do go on. Really lends to your credibility going forward.

&gt; Why is it unrelated?

Because he is talking about the fact theres immigrants and blending in almost all European countries, not just Britain, and she brings up his property and tax in America. Should I go in simpler words for you to understand, or can you keep up and just being obtuse for fuck knows what reason?

&gt; Which means it is ok to lie?

What the fuck kind of point is this? Im not defending his anger, Im saying in the context of the video alone its understandable why hes mad. I see I am going to have to talk slower and simpler for you...

&gt; A rational, reasonable, intelligent person takes the default position of requiring proof before accepting an accusation. I saw the video and asked ""where is his proof of this?"" and then found that someone in the comments linked to them saying it was false. Your lovely sub over there took the default position of ""he is telling the truth"" which is literally the fastest way to be mislead by charlatans. Good job!

He says, and I quote:

""Did you or did you not do what I just said?... I have emails, that wonder wonderful method of tracking""

to which she eventually replies:

""Part of the reason they cancelled was they couldnt find a speaker in time, and the cost of that on top of me being asked to be paid for two days work.""

Which is exactly what he had claimed, that she wanted to be paid and that had caused the talk to be cancelled, whether partly or in full. Now I have no clue if thats 100% the truth, you have three different stories from three different groups. Now usually when someone says they are innocent of something they dont give a story where they admit fault, even partially. To be expected to think ""you know what, I think she didnt defend herself well enough, lets see if I can find more evidence for her"" is idiotic at best, sexist at worst, since youve already said you dont think women can talk in public properly.

&gt; That's right, concoct a conspiracy theory so that you can keep thinking of her as a """"""""cunt"""""""" and him as a righteously angry dude who is just so put upon because DAE white men are the most oppressed??!?!?!?

Are you dyslexic or illiterate? Did you not see me calling him a fuck and cunt repeatedly? Or do you live in some fantasy world where you invent conversations and victim complexes wherever you go? Did you even watch the video? Because the story they both gave is different to the one the society gave as well, so at least two groups are wrong in some part here.

What we have been seeing this week is a lot of politicians alternating between the nice talk of still being friends and having a new relationship, and the not-so-nice talk and veiled threats and trying to convince the other side that we are the ones with the stronger hand here.

What we actually need is leaders, on both sides, who will get on with trying to find the best possible outcome for everyone given where we all now are. If they really had the good will they claim, surely they would start by looking for as much common ground as they could find to establish good faith and reassure those with the most uncertainty.

Everyone says they want to look out for the future of other EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. Everyone agrees that the Ireland/NI border needs to be handled sensitively for the benefit of those on both sides. There are a bunch of smaller European programmes, like Erasmus+, that seem to bring substantial benefits to some groups for relatively little cost and aren't volatile politically. Why not talk about these, and how although the UK will withdraw from the EU that doesn't mean all mutually beneficial arrangements must be lost.

Instead, we seem to be getting the most inflammatory and almost comical claims out first. Gibraltar was an obvious example. There is zero chance that the UK will give an inch on this one, and raising the issue at all is naked opportunism by the Spanish government that just gets in the way of any real progress.

The £51B ""bill"" is another good example. Given the conflict over a certain £350M/week claim during the referendum campaign, and given that the current EU budget cycle only runs to 2020 and we're almost certainly still going to be members until March 2019 anyway, how do you get anywhere near £51B? The principle that the UK should honour any commitments it's already made (and continue to receive any related benefits, of course) is one thing, but a bill that size would mean the Leave campaign were actually being modest in the £350M/week figure and the EU actually costs us far more than anyone ever acknowledged. Arguing along those lines is hardly going to make for calm, reasonable discussions, nor to win any hearts and minds among the people of the UK.

This is all very unfortunate. I really hope it's just some opening salvos to provide political cover because this was the week that the Brexit process officially started for real, and that the rhetoric and the actual discussions among the bureaucrats will turn quickly towards finding mutually beneficial areas where we can continue to cooperate.",3,Silhouette,BritishPolitics,False,0,True,,t3_62rf2a,False,dfp3b6l,1491064311,,,0,1493708079,

I saw someone recently, who runs a huge traditionalist page on Facebook, blaming Jews and big banks for Vatican-ii.   
  
While I agree with the traditionalists about the dangers of modernism 100%, they mostly tend to still be modernists who just want a dictator to suppress anyone who doesn't agree with them.   
To them, ""tradition"" all stems from the later middle ages. The entire first millennium doesn't matter to them, although its arguably the most important time in Christianity since pretty much everything we all believe in developed then. But the obsession with tradition is more about high European culture and society rather than Christianity in and of itself.     
   
I'll admit that I've often swung too far on the justice side of things, forgetting that ultimately what Christ taught us was mercy. I also tend to forget that its not really within the power of man to change the world on his own. It's Christ's world to change, and by placing so much emphasis on trying to force cultural shifts rather than simply being the living change we wish to see will only lead to sin and misery.

I think that's due to him being disruptive to the status quo at that time. It will be interesting to know why he was unpopular to that group. He took power in a relatively traditional society and outlawed FGM, Polygamy and forced marriages. He also suppressed  powers held by tribal chiefs,took away their lands and redistributed it to the population. That of course would have made him unpopular among an older generation who saw those are normal and part of their tradition.He was very invested in creating a future for the younger generations.

&gt;and autarky is rarely (never?) considered a good thing by economists.

that's if you completely remove the context from the situation. There was famine and little industry in the country. The goal was not to isolate the country. I don't think he imposed any trade restrictions. He did force public servants to wear locally produced attires but I think that was it. The goal was to create industries in the country so that they will have something to trade on the global market. Autarky makes more sense than importing up to the basic necessities.The country was poor.They didn't have the money to afford letting the free market decide their futures. He did what every developed country does which is invest in its local economy. Self sufficiency regarding food is something that is very important to the EU and the USA.They heavily subsidies that industry to keep themselves self-sufficient.

Quite likely, and so much in the same way they developed an intuitive understanding of the materials they worked with.  

Inherent in the question is an anachronistic understanding of mathematics. [This](http://sites.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/NQ_16_200/manuscript.php?fullpage=1/) is a high resolution scan of Newton's own 1687 copy of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, the most important work on mathematics since Euclid's Elements written circa 300BC (note most of the Elements likely isn't his own work). Flicking through you'll notice it doesn't really resemble today's mathematical notation: it's word and geometry heavy, with few equations. The adoption of Arabic numerals and equations was largely a development of the Italian Renaissance. This tells you something about the way people thought about mathematics until really surprisingly recently.  

Mathematics in Europe had its first resurgence since the Greeks in the 12th century with the translation into Latin of works preserved or developed in the Arabic world. The word algebra itself was introduced to Europe in 1145, the period of your question, when Robert of Chester translated Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī's 820 work The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing. The book was a compilation of known methods for solving quadratic equations and finding areas and volumes. It essentially founded algebra as a discipline and like the work of the Greeks [has a very heavy geometric focus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Bodleian_MS._Huntington_214_roll332_frame36.jpg).  

Even if this translation had made its way to your mason, and he was literate enough to read it, it doesn't contain the kind of mathematics needed by an architect or engineer. Nor does Euclid's Elements, or indeed any other book of the time. Mathematics was until much later a fundamentally geometric discipline. This is apparent even in the musings of Descartes in [The Meditations](http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/percep/DescartesMeditations.pdf) in the early 1600s where his objects of mathematics are all figures.

Currently recruiting for additional DPS in particular, **Boomkins/Hunters/Retridins/Rogues**.

We are also looking for another **Tank with a decent dps OS**.

Reasonable people can disagree on what form they'd like Brexit to take or debate how far it should go in this or that respect, but is it realistic to achieve *any* of the most commonly given reasons for voting Leave while remaining in the Single Market?

By default, we'd still be subject to EU regulations and to the jurisdiction of the ECJ. We'd still be contributing financially. We couldn't control immigration any more than before. We couldn't negotiate trade deals independently with non-EU partners. Obviously different outcomes are possible in international relations if all parties are willing to agree on a deal, but it would take something quite unusual to achieve any of those things post-Brexit while remaining a member of the Single Market.

We know that about 17 million people voted to leave and we don't know why they did, but surely those have to be four of the most likely reasons.

&gt; There’s nothing wrong with teaching governments to tell better stories and connect with people, but “stratcomms” have their limit. One thing they cannot and will not do is singlehandedly win the information war with Russia that we now find ourselves fighting.

I do think Trump is different, for many reasons, and given his behavior I don't think the criticism is unfair. There was hardly a the_barack community that banned all criticism of him either. And the Senate just told us flat out that Russia has infiltrated our discourse completely. You can't just ignore that they did it on his behalf, and possibly with his consent, though we don't know yet. It's serious stuff.

We probably don't agree on policy. I've lived in Europe and Australia and Japan and it's hard for me to accept the taxes I pay here and how little I get for them in terms of services compared to other countries. It's our tax dollars--why can't they be used to take care of us in any way other than missiles? And what happened with the Supreme Court is simply indefensible no matter your party.

I try to think like this: the tax policy that would benefit me personally the most (and I think encourage American small business) would be repealing the self-employment tax. Would I vote for someone who ran on that policy, even if they were a horrible person who had a lot of other terrible policies that might not effect me directly? And the answer is just...no.

Yes, we're sorry about that, but unfortunately we have to pursue our own future in the same way Ireland does, both the UK and EU have identified keeping the border with the North open, and we have the Common Travel Area which the UK has no interest in ending, ultimately Ireland is cared about by both sides and I believe we'll attempt to make Brexit as easy as we can on our neighbour.

I think the jury is still out about the European Union, Britain pulled out ... prematurely. 

For example the Greek crisis and the migrant crisis are cited as EU ailments. But I'm not sure that those are not problems that would happen anyways. I mean Greece had serious structural economic issues since early 70s, it was a matter of time before they went ""boom"", and the Syrians would inevitably move twords Europe regardless, given that the rest of the Arab countries literally closed the borders to them...

What Britain would not have is eastern European migration, but even that is unclear whether it would be temporary up until the point that East Europe would become developed.

You know what affects the brain more than just being fully developed... experience, training, knowledge... the lessons they learn by doing, making decisions, and accepting the consequences of those decisions.   

You know what the worst thing you can possibly do to someone's mental development... protect and isolate them so that they have little ingrained experience with responsibility and real consequences. Which is why you see so many absolutely clueless college kids... they've been over protected and never given the chance to actually internalize real life lessons as kids and teens, they've internalized a watered down sanitized skewed fantasy version that will hobble them for their entire life... because their ingrained experiences have little basis in adult reality... and those connections are vital to make as the kid develops and grows, once the brain stops developing, those connections are pretty much set. This is why a 15 year old kid, who has experienced hard life lessons, had the full weight of decisions and consequences laid on them by absentee parents, will be far more mature at 15 than those kids coddled and protected by helicopter parents will ever be at 30.  

To use ""the brains not fully formed until 25"" is a bullshit argument to discount, marginalize and further hamstring youth from fully engaging in life, finding their own truths, and challenging the status quo... in the misguided belief that this is for their own protection. It's not protecting them, it's castrating them to keep them docile and compliant, because most parents don't have the balls to actually deal with kids who can think for themselves.

Brains can handle a hell of a lot more than most kids are challenged with. Taught correctly, and they can do complex math before they reach their teens, handle a vast array of abstract ideas, drive a vehicle that could easily kill them or leave them crippled for life (at 15)... but they can't be trusted to decide whether they want to have sex with someone they're attracted to?  

 That's bullshit, it's not that the teens can't possibly  handle those decisions, the vast majority probably could (they do in a number of Scandinavian, and European countries) it's that their American parents don't want to deal with the situation, and have done everything they can to legislate away a situation they're too chickenshit to deal with personally...

t1_dfj9dqd,t5_2ssp3,"&gt;Do you think modern anthropology is becoming something similar to what you would identify as an indigenous paradigm?

I think modern anthropology is definitely shifting more towards a view that is compatible with an Indigenous paradigm. I believe it is even borrowing from an Indigenous paradigm under certain circumstances. But there are still some clear distinctions.

&gt;How much religion, spirituality and personal opinions are involved in research before there is a bias or conflict of interest that skews the results? That almost sounds like the way anthropology used to be conducted by Europeans.

Great question! So when we take into account such subjective fields in a holistic approach, it does become imperative that we guard against biases in the research. Within an Indigenous research paradigm, there are safeguards against this.

The first would be to recognize that including religion or spirituality doesn't mean they dominate the research. And that is what I would say is a big difference from the way anthropology was conducted by the Europeans in the past (who now overly emphasize objectivity). Rather than advancing with research on the basis that it conforms to a preconceived religious notion or dogma, religion and spirituality are seen as components of the whole picture and are inserted where they would make sense or answer a question.

The second would be to use methods that limit intrusive subjective points. One method is known as triangulation. As it sounds, this involves using multiple (at least three) methods of research to analyze a possible point of interest or data. This would be done with points that include subjective elements.

And a third way would be to remember in order to operate within an Indigenous research paradigm, we have to essentially change our mentality. Because of this, it is quite easy to say that religion, spirituality, and/or personal opinions can obscure, form a bias, or conflict with designated objective results. The reality for many Indigenous people, however, is that viewing things through a spiritual sense is the only way to see something or that it is impossible to separate that kind of view from anything. This means that to really gauge the level of subjectively in these regards interjected into the research, we would have to be in it to tell and it is a bit too abstract to have a definitive answer within the context of this conversation.

For a little more explanation on defeating a bias, also [check out this comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5un7xl/meta_as_historians_how_do_you_recognise_and_avoid/ddvgu2e/) with provided pictures (courtesy of yours truly)!",3,Snapshot52,AskHistorians,False,0,True,moderator,t3_5tu3ph,False,dfp8yxc,1491072490,Moderator | Native American Studies | Colonialism,,0,1493710808,
t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

perhaps where the confusion occurs is that the europeans (the germans at least) use the word 'herpes' conventionally to denote oral cold sores, which just like in north america, are not a big deal. so someone saying in germany ""i have herpes"" or fieberblasen (cold sores) is akin to someone saying ""i have cold sores"".

 **comment content**: 3-4 years ago while I was continuing my education I ended up in an intro to speech class. The professor was an older white guy with a propensity to wax on conservative issues in his class. I was constantly at odds with this, as the classroom was no place for ideologues especially in a subject where it was unnecessary.

One of the things that he brought up was this exact concept: the problem with sanctuary cities as well as ""no-go zones"" in Paris and London.

Not being nearly as educated as I am now, I would get into arguments with him about how no go zones didn't exist, Muslims weren't trying to take over Europe, and that sanctuary cities were a positive thing for us (living in Texas especially). 

Of course, an intro to speech class was not the place to have these discussions, and maybe if he did offer strong evidence at the time I would have cast it away regardless. But now I look back on a man that I regarded with disgust and realize he was absolutely fucking right, and it blows my mind to say that.

 But consider the less wealthy that voted for him - at the moment the Democratic party seem like the best thing in the world compared to the republicans (they're certainly leaps and bounds better in my opinion), but there's a reason those people voted for Trump, or voted for Britain to leave the EU, from what I can see, many of them didn't feel the great effects of being born in a developed country, instead they're born into a society where they are quite likely not socially mobile, depending on the colour of their skin they've been treated differently, if they get sick they're fucked unless they can afford to buy good health insurance, from their perspective the Democrats have been in charge, and the country hasn't gotten better, here's maybe an opportunity to change that - let's vote for the other party.

t1_dfpaqa6,t5_2sumw,"Forgive me for not being at my computer right now so I can't research these things properly or reference them, but off the top of my head, from most recently dating back...

Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands and France had the foresight to lay down 3G (and later 4G) networks across almost their entire countries to provide Internet access in even the most remote regions (northern Sweden and the fjords, for example) back in the early 00s, when we were debating whether or not we should adopt 3G, enabling their entire population access to what I consider to be the pinnacle of information sharing. 

Of course, this wasn't a problem as they'd already laid all the copper (while we were trying to cut costs and laying aluminium core cabling for telephones and the suchlike to rural areas in the 60s/70s) and were in process of laying fibre optic whilst we labelled fitting out our minuscule landmass with this excessive optical lark as too expensive. 

A standard of which by definition is future proof, barring humanity breaking the laws of physics in the future and figuring out a way to send information faster than the speed of light. Oh, and that aluminium cabling? Aside from providing people in Cornwall, Wales and Scotland with telephones that sounded worse than the old vinyl cylinder recordings, also proved useless for maintaining any sort of Internet connection, be it dialup or DSL, the latter of which usually required complete gutting and refitting with a *proper* conductor, namely copper. All at the expense of the homeowner, I might add. 

And whilst we're on the subject of Sweden, let's discuss their '71(?) decision to change from RHD to LHD. Was it to fall in line with the rest of Europe? Was it gut feeling? Well, actually the government there ran a study and discovered that given their road infrastructure and the actual camber of most of their roads, it was statistically safer to switch. This is an example of forward thinking and science trumping gut feeling, which from what I can tell is the only reason I have to put stickers on my headlights when I go to France and remember which lane I should prefer when coming off a roundabout over there. All of this whilst we were in uproar about changing our currency to a decimal model(!), again, the furore based solely on ""gut feeling"". If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

But as this is getting rather Nordic-centric, perhaps we should look at the fact that France has enough nuclear power to meet 80% of our energy demands as well as their own, all pumped through courtesy of the Eurotunnel, whilst we continually shut down the only real modern solution to our ongoing energy crisis. Why? Oh. That's right. Gut feeling again. What's that you say? Chernobyl? I'm sorry, but you can't compare modern nuclear facilities run and managed by developed countries to to that of an early model reactor, flawed in design, run by a dictatorship who insisted on covering up the accident whilst it was still possible to prevent the aftermath that we (I?) lived through. I can source this last part - my uncle was the mathematician behind the first Triton series of reactors and my brother worked for DEFRA shutting all of them down back in the 00s, a government decision thanks to activist groups that was again based more on ""gut feeling"" than actual science, much less our ever increasing energy concerns.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

""There is no fee charged for the exchange of currency and the rates are posted on a card stamped with the Bank's official mark.""

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"9/11 was perpetrated as a joint operation between the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in order to justify a string of wars in the Middle East. The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.
There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.
Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

- ""Rich becoming richer"" is a very serious flaw in capitalism. I think Piketty has shown convincingly enough that this is the case, yet the only remedy he has come up with is a global wealth tax. I think we could come up with better solutions there

- Capitalists will inevitably stop moving production to cheap countries, because automation will replace those cheap laborers at home. This is also true for cheap service workers. Automation will reduce the dependence of the west to underdeveloped countries before overpopulation becomes a global problem (2040-2050 according to UN i think).

- The ""threat"" of outbreeding is not viable long-term: IMO, we are probably the last generation that does not have the ability to change its DNA and the DNA of its offspring. When the people of the future design their kids, which DNA you think they 'd pick? A guy from congo or a danish guy (probably a mix, in different pieces hehe).

At the moment i don't think there even is ""something to be done"" about population growth.

The Prime Directive is, as the title suggests, the most important policy implemented by the Federation. The Prime Directive prohibits the interference in any planet, civilization, or society that has not yet achieved deep space travel and invented warp drive technology.

The reason this law was enacted was to prevent advanced societies from artificially accelerating or changing an alien race's evolution and development by injecting technology that the alien race had not yet created on their own.

&gt;Literally Africans have been given everything they could to have better countries and they ruin it.

I believed this for a long time myself. In reality, colonialism didn't give Africans everything they needed to have better lives. Instead, colonialism was directly responsible for artificially accelerating *certain aspects* of anthropological evolution in African civilizations with elements that they were in no way prepared to handle properly. We gave them weapons and military training when their societies were still in an era in their civilization that Europe and East Asia abandoned centuries ago.

I don't disgaree that bringing large populations of African migrants into European societies is catastrophically bad, but it's not because Africans are somehow biologically or genetically or objectively inferior to European and Asian ethnicities. It's because we in advanced societies demand a level of cognitive evolution that simply *hasn't happened yet* in those countries.

These are simply grammar rules that derive from Latin and further Indo-European language roots. It's simply a grammatical system.

Beyond that, it's a lot easier to change people's opinion than a language system that's been in development since the 3rd century.

Most of the high-end mounts come with GoTo because they are designed with it in mind, and at that point the price of additional electronics becomes a much less significant part of the mount's price than in the sub-500€ sector, where it makes up for a large part of it.

Once again, try reading your own articles. Maybe not a peg, but the point is that an independent currency is on the cards. Nobody in the SNP wants a currency union anymore.

&gt; but it is no-ones interest for Scottish independence. 

Which is why, with the exception of one YouGov survey, literally every opinion poll since Brexit has shown an increase in support for independence, with a few even tipping ""Yes"" into the majority. Which is why the momentum is so clearly on the Yes side. If you're Scottish, then I'm pretty surprised by how much you're talking down your country. If you're not, then I don't know why I'm even bothering to argue with you.

Unless you're from San Diego and get posted to Tijuana or something, you can't just pop over to have dinner with them or even just drive home for the weekend for something.  

Also, I had lived overseas prior to joining the Foreign Service, so was somewhat prepared for missing family and friends.  It's also a little easier to live overseas now (vs nearly 20 years ago) due to technology and also access to embassy commissaries, DPO and pouch mail, etc.  But, it's also a little harder because I know that, unless I leave the Foreign Service, I won't live close to my family and friends from home until I retire.  When I lived overseas before, I knew that I'd be coming back home after a certain period of time, but the FS will keep me away from living near family and friends from home indefinitely.  That's a bit different if you're from somewhere near the DC area or maybe even NYC with USUN jobs.  But, I'm not from either of those places.

For Russia annexation, it depends on the country. If they attempt or do annex any of the Baltic States or any other NATO member, it's a problem that the US cannot ignore.

But the US has shown over multiple administrations (Bush and Obama) that if it's in the former Soviet sphere of influence, then we practically could give two shits about it.

But it's also concerning to me that we appear to be one false flag attack away from a war with Iran due to Iran hawks still being rather ascendant in our government. 

I don't think there's a clear case that the ballistic missiles contravene the JCPOA or any other treaty obligations. As much as it sucks that Iran has them (and we need to keep our eye on them for sure), sovereign countries have a right to possess them. And it's not as if their missile technology is exclusively built for nuclear payload, they have non-nuclear usage.

The ""Death to America"" stuff is basically an old tired meme at this point. The Islamic Republic uses this slogan to signify its opposition to historical American meddling in their country, which *did* happen. We helped overthrow their populist leader Mossadegh in the 1950s, we armed Saddam with poison gas to use against Iranians, etc. There is ample cause for the bad blood is what I'm saying. Moreover, the slogan does not mean death to Americans.

From [Khamenei](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/ayatollah-khamenei-iran-death-to-america) himself:


&gt;“It goes without saying that the slogan does not mean death to the American nation; this slogan means death to the US’s policies, death to arrogance""

Moreover, in [current year], the anti-Americanism is [more subdued](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-anniversary-2017-story.html) than it has been in the past for their celebrations of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

The JCPOA was poorly negotiated (Trump was correct that we could have gotten more out of it, and the cash bribery element of it was bullshit) but I think it was better than nothing. I'd like to see some rapprochement between Iran and the US. I think we have common interests such as destroying ISIS and Wahhabist jihadists in general. And what's more I don't think there is a great deal of anti-Americanism in rank and file Iranians. Iranian people in general have a high opinion of American people and like our culture. It's their government that is the obstacle (and please don't take this as me advocating we do regime change, because I think that has a definite tendency to make things worse as in Iran, Libya, Syria).

As for nuclear program, like it or not Iran has a right to a peaceful nuclear program (energy, physics research, medical isotopes) as a sovereign country and as a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty. They've never violated the nonproliferation treaty by the way, whereas Israel is not even a signatory, has a secret nuclear program, and uses nuclear blackmail ([Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option)) against Europe. 

I just don't think Iran has the capacity to make highly enriched weapons grade uranium. IAEA monitoring is in place. Their ability to even make low-enriched uranium is highly diminished after implementation of JCPOA. 

TLDR, we should definitely keep our eye on them but I don't see  Iran as a big threat to America, I just don't.

Still hate it, particularly Parisians, not the city itself you understand. Any who it was a real eye opener to the French and I wish I could've spent more than 4 days there, with her. I very much dig the passion from the French. It's not that I failed in the destinations every 4 days or so, I quite enjoyed the rougher pace I set. Nor is it that I felt fatigued or burned out until a month and a half in.

Quite a few scenarios like that from my first backpacking trip actually, not centered around women. Met one of the coolest, nicest and knowledgeable Ozzie's I've ever met since in London, my first place to visit. He was at the end of his trip and I was just beginning but man I wish I had hung around the guy for a week. The knowledge that man had.

t1_dfpg9wh,t5_30hhs,"&gt;It's cute how you refuse to understand neither the ideological reasoning that underpins US foreign policy

I'm sorry if my brain is too defective to understand your inconsistent argument that's as full of holes as one of the tens of thousands of democratic activists in Latin America that were executed by American trained death squads :D

&gt; nor the fact that in practical terms what I'm saying is completely accurate.

In practical terms what you're saying isn't even remotely accurate or based in reality. 

&gt; The US is unique in that it benefits from the global spread of democracy

It certainly doesn't, and for obvious reasons. Should democracy begin spreading worldwide, toppling the undemocratic regimes that run the economies which currently constitute the lynchpins of the global economy, e.g the CPC in China or the potentates of GCC aligned regimes, the US economy would collapse, just like the economies of all other countries. The shocks such instability would produce would make the Great Depression look like a jolly good time. 

&gt; That's one of the reasons why the post-2006 democratic retreat has coincided with a period of US retreat and weakness

The US has been retreating because it's economic power has declined in relation to the rest of the world. The US rose because it single-handedly dominated the global economy, and it has been rapidly losing its hegemonic role since the 2000s because it is no longer the centre of global economic activity, now it's merely a centre. This isn't a ""period"", it's a historic trend. That pendulum ain't swining back unless Europe and East Asia are burned to the ground.

- Kurdish literature was and still is suppressed in ""Turkish"" Kurdistan, the area where most Kurds live, and where some of the most important classic Kurdish authors hailed from. 
- The borders have prevented Kurds from different parts from actively interacting with each other.

t1_dfp0uyf,t5_3amv4,"Those terms that you know it by are what white supremacists, white ""nationalists"" (supremacists) , and ""alt righters"" (white supremacists) call it. It's very obvious what world view you come from.

No, millions or more than a billion. Those in Asia who have learned the names Sun Yat Sen/Sun Zhong San, Ahn Jeung Geun, etc..

No, I'm not going to excuse you for using white supremacy, white world order-in-which-Asian-men-are-subhumans, and other colonialist society derived words for ""conservatism.""

Instead of pulling shit from your ass why don't you cite where white colonizer definitions of ""limited government"" show up in Tao Te Ching (I bet you do not even know how to say this word properly in Mandarin and do not even know what the correct pinyin way of writing it is - and guess what unlike most westernized/communist types I learned an alternate form of pinyin which uses oracle bone derived characters)

These types of ideas are universal among humans, so it doesn't matter. What matters is whether you subscribe to white peoples' world view or to a uniquely Asian man's world view, that is, if you are even really an Asian man. If you are an Asian man for other Asian men who is against white supremacy and colonialism.

I derive my ideas based off of my own ideas and studies of Asian history, as well as the well documented conflicts between white supremacist colonialists and nonwhites. Something I came up with independently until I came across people who came to the same conclusion 100 years ago, such as Ahn Jung Geun. You could say I take inspiration from the military campaigns of Zheng Cheng Gong who kicked out the rapist white supremacist Dutch imperialists from Taiwan. By the way most of the scholars in the past have no concept of conflict with other races, because until European white supremacist imperialism and colonialism, such a concept did not exist. Alexander only made it as far as India.

Both western ""nationalism"" and western ""communism"" were used to divide and conquer Asia. People here are above it all, yes, because calling yourself one or the other is falling into the trap of following along with white supremacy.

A post Bakumatsu imperial Japan was actually nothing more than a Japanese nationalist state who saw themselves as the ""whites of Asia"" and took inspiration from the British, Germans, and european Americans.

A communist China was based upon white peoples' communism, and I'm no supporter of that.

As stated before, both ideologies, both of them white, were used to divide and conquer Asia.

The Heian period is considered a high point/golden age of Japanese culture, and anyone who has a cursory knowledge of the period would know that it was when 国風文化 was being developed, which meant a unique culture not tied to China. The incompetence in the later period is what happens when any golden age is coming to an end or any dynasty is on the decline. That has been the cycle in all of human history.

To call the Sengoku period the height of Japan is to call the San Guo period of China right after the fall of the Han as the  ""Golden Age"" when both were warring states periods where hundreds of thousands or millions of Asians died fighting each other. Or another example, the period of warring states following the 春秋時代. Sure, many heroes rose, **but only a white nationalist would rejoice at many Asians killing each other in the hundreds of thousands to millions.**


Shut up and prove that you are even Asian. Go verify it with the mods.

BTW trying to limit Asian men to Asian women is anti Asian men. Asian men should have all the options in the world.

As of April 17, 1956, 12,949 individuals were scheduled for apprehension in an emergency.

I've been trying to guess the size of the illegals program. If they had around 13,000 in 1956, they'd have around 25,000 today going by the population growth. I guess it's impossible to really know for sure, since some of them might avoid detection.

&gt;The facts, however, are far more sensational even than the story dismissed as impossible by the SVR. The KGB defector had brought with him to Britain details not of a few hundred but of thousands of Soviet agents and intelligence officers in all parts of the globe, some of them ""illegals"" living under deep cover abroad, disguised as foreign citizens. No one who spied for the Soviet Union at any period between the October Revolution and the eve of the Gorbachev era can now be confident that his or her secrets are still secure. When the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) exfiltrated the defector and his family from Russia in 1992, it also brought out six cases containing the copious notes he had taken almost daily for twelve years, before his retirement in 1984, on top secret KGB files going as far back as 1918. The contents of the cases have since been described by the American FBI as ""the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source.""

&gt;The aim of the alleged spy ring is said to have been to supply Moscow with intelligence on US defense policy, specifically nuclear weapons, as well as various Congressional activities. It appears that most of the alleged spy ring’s contacts were in the Washington, DC beltway, and included members of nongovernmental organizations, pressure groups, think tanks, and lobbyists. It is worth noting that the ten Russian NOCs have not been charged with espionage, but rather with “conspiring to act as unauthorized foreign agents” and “conspiracy to commit money laundering”.

&gt;The United States has allegedly revoked an entry visa previously issued to the former Deputy Minister of Defense of Peru, over suspicions that he is connected to a major Russian espionage ring found operating in the United States. Fabián Novak had his visa revoked after he was allegedly included on a list drawn by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, containing names of individuals connected to a Russian illegals program caught operating in the US in 2010. According to El Comercio, Peru’s oldest newspaper, Novak, who served as the country’s Deputy Defense Minster between 2006 and 2008, met repeatedly with two members of the 11-member Russian spy ring, which was busted in a series of coordinated raids across several US states in July of 2010.

&gt;After years of F.B.I. surveillance, investigators decided to make the arrests last weekend, just after an upbeat visit to President Obama by the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said one administration official. Mr. Obama was not happy about the timing, but investigators feared some of their targets might flee, the official said.

&gt;Three Russians charged by the U.S. with espionage allegedly sought secrets tied to the New York Stock Exchange and U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, even while one bemoaned his tedious job’s lack of a James Bond flair.

&gt;...Podobnyy said the job was nothing like he expected, and nothing like a James Bond movie.

&gt;“Of course, I wouldn’t fly helicopters,” he said in a recorded conversation, according to the complaint. “But, pretend to be someone else at a minimum.”

&gt;Podobnyy also complained a department in Russia known as Directorate S was the only one left doing real intelligence work. Directorate S ran the so-called Illegals program.

&gt;“Look, in the States even the S couldn’t do anything,” Podobnyy was recorded as saying, according to the complaint. “They caught 10 of them.”

&gt; “They always targeted political figures,” David Major, a retired FBI counterintelligence agent explained to ABC News. “They want to know who is a mover and shaker in our society, who affects it.”

&gt;And today as questions continue to mount over what contacts Trump campaign aides may have had with Russian intelligence operatives, the White House continues to dispute media reports that any of the president’s associates had such contact while on the campaign trail.

&gt;U.S. intelligence officials say the Russians are engaged in a massive campaign to infiltrate and disrupt American politics. It has gone on for decades, originally with the Cold War goal of placing a mole inside the White House, a retired KGB officer who once ran spy operations in Washington told ABC News. 

http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/31/nation/la-na-russian-spies-20111101
&gt; The agents, whom the U.S. sent to Russia in July 2010 in the largest spy swap since the Cold War, are not accused of stealing any U.S. secrets. But they were more dangerous than commonly believed, C. Frank Figliuzzi, FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said in an interview.

&gt;They were ""the cream of the crop"" of trained Russian intelligence agents, he said, and they were sent here to blend in and befriend American policymakers. They were succeeding, Figliuzzi said.

&gt; ""Several were getting close to high-ranking officials,"" he said. One had gone to work for a confidant of a U.S. Cabinet member, he added, declining to offer details.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071205341.html
&gt;Two questions: Have we caught all the ""illegals"" that Russia's security service, the SVR, has planted over the years in the United States? And will the SVR press the reset button with the Obama administration and not send additional ""illegals"" to this country?

&gt;In a background briefing for reporters on Thursday, a senior administration official familiar with the Justice Department's assessment of the situation described how the 10 who were arrested as ""sleeper agents"" had been under investigation for years. The official added: ""We have effectively shut down the illegal program here.""

&gt;Other sources in the law enforcement and intelligence communities do not share that view, although, of course, they will not say so publicly.

&gt;As one former senior intelligence official put it, ""How would we know?""

&gt;The Russians have used ""illegals"" in their espionage activities since the October 1917 revolution. As the FBI put it in the June 27 complaint, ""illegals"" are provided false identities and documents, obtain citizenship or legal resident permits of target countries, and ""pursue degrees at target-country universities, obtain employment, and join relevant professional associations."" They ""work to hide all connections between themselves and Russia, even as they act at the direction and under the control of the SVR."" Gathering data on people who can later be recruited as spies is a primary goal, instead of stealing secrets themselves. In the trade, they are called spotters.

&gt;... The best public indication of the extent of Moscow's efforts comes from the late Sergei Tretyakov, the former Russian intelligence officer who under the guise of a press officer at the U.N. Mission ran espionage operations in New York City from 1995 to 2000. He served the last three of those years as a double agent for the FBI until he defected to the United States. As Tretyakov told author Pete Earley in the book ""Comrade J,"" at one time he had more than 60 SVR officers working inside the United Nations and more than 160 contacts made up of illegals, outright spies, and other people who knowingly or unknowingly could supply information useful to Russia.

&gt;... What will the Russians do now? In a C-SPAN interview two years ago, Tretyakov said that when the Cold War was over, the United States asked Russia to stop the KGB's covert propaganda activities that portrayed Washington in foreign media as carrying out terrible activities, such as saying the United States was spreading HIV in Africa.

&gt;In response, Tretyakov said, the KGB closed down ""Department A,"" which ran those activities, but then established the MS program, which did the same thing. ""Nothing changed,"" he said.

&gt;The U.S. answer may have come on PBS's ""NewsHour"" last week.

&gt;White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told Jim Lehrer that the arrest of the 10 illegals, their guilty pleas and the prisoner exchange last week ""sends a clear signal to, not only Russia, but other countries that will attempt this, that we are on to them.""

Pros:

- Pretty as fuck.

- Chloe

- Shooting is a lot better.

- Villain is more interesting

- Puzzles are a tad more complex

- Them set pieces

- I really like it when games/films/series do the whole res media thing with flash backs.

- Great music.

- No longer is it the white guys killing all of the ethnics!

- No fucking jet ski!

- No QTEs that come out of nowhere.

- Way less of the whole 'how the fuck did the baddies get infront of me when I just unlocked the damn place?!'

- Stealth in regular combat areas was more interesting and viable.

Cons:

- Shooting still isn't all that wonderful

- Insta kill stealth and set piece sections.

- The climbing options weren't always clear.

- We seemed to have moved from America's 3rd greatest fear (hispanics and south east asians) to their 2nd greatest fear: Eastern Europeans. Plus, we still have an English bad guy! My prediction for the 3rd game is that it will be a middle Eastern villain with an English villain too!

- Shallow weapon variety

- Lots of opening doors and giving a lift to ai partners so they can kick down ladders that really serve no purpose but to slow down the game.

- Some enemies become supidly tank like at the end.

- Final boss fight is kinda weak.

- Puzzles still aren't all that interesting.

- Nathan kills sooooooo any people, even the villain pointed that out!

- The return of Blondie McFuckwit.

- Inconsistant jumping ability.

- Nathan didn't roll his fucking sleees down when he was in a fucking snowstorm!

- Riot shield enemies, nobody ever likes them so why do they keep putting them in?!

- Why isn't ammo auto-picked up? It is super annoying and serves no purpose having me have to press a button to pick it up and it only serves to further annoy when you accidently pick up a new weapon instead of ammo.

I think it goes without saying that you will be better off in hostels if you would like to conserve money for activities, food, alcohol, etc. This doesn't mean that you need to compromise on the quality of the hostel! I usually find the nicest, most well-located hostel I can in a city. This will run you 30-60 euros a night. 

If you are looking to save money, I would suggest researching Venice the most. It is easy to drop quite a bit of money without intending to while in that area. For example, not knowing when the buses stop operating will mean you will have to take an expensive cab at the end of your day back to your hotel.   

Then comes the hidden cost of a trip, the exchange rate! In most of Europe, you will be completely fine with paying credit card for most of the trip. This is the best option, because you pay the lowest exchange rate fees. I would withdraw just enough petty cash to get you by or to buy a trinket on the street. 

My final money saving advice would be to stay away from tour guides. Tour guides, while nice, are very expensive. Getting a tour guide at a site can be over 50 euros. This is outrageous in my mind, because they are only putting in 2-3 hours at the most of work.

t3_62u7za,t5_2rxxm,"&gt; ...my American parents are living in London until spring 2018...
&gt; ...I am in the process of getting a tourist visa for the UK (have an expedited office nearby)...

Do you have a US passport? If your parents have US citizenship, then you are also an American citizen and don't need a visa to enter the UK for a tourist visit of six months or less. If you don't have a US passport yet, you should get one; it will make travel to the rest of Europe much easier. The UK is not in the Schengen Zone, so if you are traveling under a passport from a country that requires a visa to enter the UK, you would almost certainly need to apply for separate visas for Schengen and for each non-Schengen European country you want to enter. With a US passport, you won't need to apply for tourist visas in any EU country. 

Also, I don't believe you can opt to pay the NHS surcharge due to the short duration of your visit; you will have to pay for any health services you use up front (except in cases of emergency, in which case they would treat you and then bill you afterwards). I would highly recommend you purchase a travel medical insurance policy for the duration of your trip, and don't expect to be able to avail of any free non-emergency care in the UK.

At least that's the situation in my country. Legally the only primary IDs are passports and separate voluntary ID cards (which are also all the ID you need to travel within Schengen); in practice, a driver's license is usually what you carry in your wallet if you have one (if not, probably the ID card), since those 3 are the ones that e.g. shops accept if they want to check you're legal age to buy alcohol/tobacco, what bouncers will usually accept etc. But if you're e.g. applying for any sort of permit from the police or such, they'll only accept the ID card or passport.

Though blowing through your travel fund is an easy thing to do in Boston, there are also plenty of things to do that won't cost you a penny; the lovely Boston Public Garden and the lively Faneuil Hall Marketplace can be experienced without opening your wallet.Four buildings – Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, North Market and South Market – constitute Faneuil Hall Marketplace, with the oldest being Faneuil Hall. Built in 1742 and now located on the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall has had a long and important history in Massachusetts politics.Samuel Adams once stood here to push for resistance against the British, and abolitionists and suffragists have stood on their soapboxes here.In fact, this is where Jonathan Mayhew famously challenged the Sugar Act of 1764 by proclaiming, ""no taxation without representation.""Since Mayhew's declaration, the marketplace has expanded to include more than 100 shops and restaurants.Some former visitors caution that the items sold at Faneuil Hall Marketplace are a bit overpriced.However, if you're looking to kill some time or snap some great photos, consider strolling through the market's halls.You'll also find various cuisines served in Quincy Market if you're in need of a quick bite.Keep in mind that this market gets crowded quickly (especially on weekends and in the summer), so it's best to visit during a weekday if you don't want to encounter hordes of people.The marketplace welcomes visitors Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and on Sundays between noon and 6 p.m. (Restaurant and store hours may vary, so it's best to consult Faneuil Hall Marketplace's website before you visit.) To reach Faneuil Hall Marketplace, which sits just south of the North End in downtown Boston, travelers can take the ""T"" to the Aquarium, Haymarket or Government Center subway stations. Eight bus routes stop a block away on Congress Street, and a parking garage can be accessed on Broad Street. An hour of parking will cost you $28, but garage tickets can be purchased on the 75 State Street Garage website for a reduced rate, and parking validation coupons are available through select retailers. No fees apply to enter any of Faneuil Hall Marketplace's buildings, and free tours and performances are occasionally provided in South Market and outside Faneuil Hall.
After Isabella Stewart Gardner's husband died in 1898, the art enthusiast bought land in Boston's Fenway area to open a museum to display her impressive collection of Italian art. The museum, which was fashioned after the Palazzo Barbaro in Venice, was completed in 1902, at which point Gardner moved in to the fourth floor and began installing her collection. Today, you can visit this Boston museum to get your fill of the Italian masters, such as Raphael and Titian. The building also showcases a cache of beautiful furniture, photographs, sculpture and rare books straight from Europe. In 2012, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by acclaimed Italian architect Renzo Piano. The most recent addition includes a glass atrium, greenhouses and landscaped gardens.Recent museumgoers said the collection captures Gardner's penchant for art, architecture and horticulture through its diverse displays. Though some previous visitors described the museum as a bit of a hodgepodge rather than a cohesive layout, many praised the property's vast collection of artifacts and intimate atmosphere. Also, remember to turn off your camera flash before entering since flash photography is not permitted inside.The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum sits a few blocks west of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston's Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood. Several buses drop within walking walking distance of the museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts metro stop is situated about five blocks away. Multiple parking lots are also located nearby. The property is open most days between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Extended hours are offered on Thursdays, and the museum is closed on Tuesdays. Tickets – which include access to all exhibits, as well as restrooms, a cafe and a gift shop – cost $15 for adults. Children 17 and younger enter for free, and reduced rates are available for college students, seniors and visitors with recent ticket stubs from the Museum of Fine Arts. Travelers who have Go Boston Cards, visit on their birthday or are named Isabella and register on the museum's website get in for free.The grounds of Boston Common started as a cow pasture in the mid-1600s. After a few years, overgrazing became a problem and the area was transformed into a British camp. After the Revolutionary War, the park became a popular locale for public speeches and rallies. Now, the Common is best known because of its status as the oldest public park in the country. You'll also find a variety of activities and events, including theater and musical performances, hosted here throughout the year.Though some visitors said you won't find much to do in this park, Boston Common is great for picnics or a leisurely stroll. Recent travelers also noted that this site is a wonderful spot to take young children. In addition to ample running room on the park's green space, kids can play at the Tadpole Playground or Frog Pond. Frog Pond offers a spray pool during the warmer months and an ice skating rink in the winter.Boston Common sits alongside the Boston Public Garden near the center of the city. The easiest way to get to the site is by the ""T"" – the Boylston Street and Park Street stations are located at the southern and eastern edges of the park – or by walking from downtown. You can also park for a fee in the underground parking garage or on the surrounding streets. The area is free to visit, but additional charges apply for food purchased at Frog Pond Café, rides on the carousel and ice skating on Frog Pond. Public restrooms are available, and in the summer, free yoga classes are offered by Frog Pond. The Common is open 24 hours a day, however, most park facilities are only open between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. To learn more about Boston Common, visit the City of Boston's website. And for more information about Frog Pond's events and amenities, check out the official Boston Common Frog Pond website.If you want to make the most out of the Museum of Fine Arts, one of the oldest art institutions in the country, then you'll need to spend a good chunk of your day here. The museum is home to one of the best art collections in the world, including the celebrated Art of the Americas wing. Inside this sprawling collection, which debuted in 2010, you'll stumble upon 53 galleries showcasing iconic pieces from pre-Columbian times to the 20th century. John Singer Sargent's dazzling pieces are one standout here, and as you delve deeper into the collection, you'll see his paintings sharing wall space with those by masters like John Singleton Copley and Edward Hopper.You'll also find an impressive collection of Asian art here, plus works from Monet, Renoir, Manet and Rembrandt on display in the European collection. And in special temporary exhibits, you can admire masterpieces from masters like Georgia O'Keeffe and Picasso.According to recent museumgoers, if you're an art lover, you'll want to devote plenty of time to explore. Additionally, consider taking a complimentary guided tour of the collections. And to save some money during your trip to Boston, plan your visit for after 4 p.m. on Wednesdays or on select open house days throughout the year when there are no entrance fees.The Museum of Fine Arts can be found a few blocks away from the Isabella Steward Gardner Museum and the Northeastern University campus in Fenway-Kenmore. Multiple bus routes have stops nearby, and three ""T"" stations – Museum of Fine Arts, Ruggles and Northeastern – sit within walking distance. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with extended hours on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. If you don't visit on a free day or have a CityPASS or Go Boston Card, expect to pay $25 to enter. Children 17 and younger get in for free on weekdays after 3 p.m. and on weekends, while students, seniors and travelers with recent Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum ticket stubs receive discounted rates. Once inside, you'll have access to most of the museum's exhibits, restrooms, restaurants and gift shops. Separate tickets are required for select exhibits. Learn more about the Museum of Fine Arts by visiting the property's website.

t3_62utkl,t5_2qhnn,"I'd like to take my own approach to answering this question.

You would have to go back a hundred years to explain China's and America's common interests. China was a colonized country and didn't have a scary national identity. Europeans had colonies around China. And even Japan annoyed China a lot. So for a while, China was a relative underdog.

Japan was more of a threat as it was seen in the world wars. And China was an enemy of Japan. When America fought in the wars, it was likely a good idea to keep China on the neutral tab.

Then with Communism, it again was likely a good idea to keep China separate from the USSR.

China was a relative laggard in military terms because Japan kept China underdeveloped. Only when America beat Japan, did China have a chance to develop more.

America never beat China militarily. America never got the chance. At the end of the day, there was only so much that America could do around the world with its comparatively smaller population. It was overwhelming just declaring war against Japan.

It was only with the advent of satellites that the true scale of the world could be fully understood. But then things developed too quickly. America pointed satellites at Russia instead. Countries like France, Israel, China, Pakistan, India etc could develop their nukes under the fog of ignorance. Computers were still too big. Computers really got small since the 2000s and nowadays countries may be able to launch hundreds of nano satellites. It all became overwhelming in a way.

Once countries like China acquired the knowhow of ICBMs, it was kind of too late to make too many demands to them. The missile shields, while promising, didn't guarantee 99% efficiency. The potential for MAD was just too great.

Since the 2000s, America's military edge started to dwindle when compared to the entire world. The aircrafts didn't get faster and more powerful, but rather more stealth. The missiles instead became more powerful, but then everybody started to get those. The world witnessed America's missile in the Gulf wars and was stealing the ideas. Technology helped other countries to develop their economies to match America's. And America started outsourcing, which helped other countries to acquire the knowhow, even without piracy.

China proved that it could shoot down satellites and started aiming at the space. Once America got into the Middle East, China sought to diversify its energy sources so that America wasn't able to control China from the distance. Commerce was just too huge a deal with thousands of ships constantly sailing all over the world, dwarfing the navies.

In many ways, China didn't feature as a priority for America. That's why it got thru unscathed.",1,contantofaz,geopolitics,1491094018,0,True,,t3_62utkl,False,dfpmobe,1491093235,,,0,1493717444,

t3_62wsv6,t5_2qwov,"Smaller parties matter in British politics. Just ask Nigel Farage. With no Ukip MPs at Westminster and his own stint as an MEP terminating without reprieve in 2019, he was still the grinning, beer-swilling, Union-Jack-sock-wearing face of Brexit on the day the prime minister sent her notice to quit to Brussels.

Or ask the Liberal Democrats. They got all the way to full partnership in the coalition government — but were then smothered by the Conservatives, mislaid their identity as a party of protest and lost 49 of their 57 seats in the 2015 general election.

Even after Sarah Olney won the Richmond Park by-election last December to become the Lib Dems’ ninth MP, that is a very low base. The old joke about the parliamentary party fitting into a people carrier still holds. But the Lib Dems are now enjoying a modest but significant recovery.

Their leader, Tim Farron, is a hard-wired optimist who compares himself favourably with the “toxic” and “incompetent” Jeremy Corbyn. At last month’s conference he set the target of replacing Labour as Britain’s main party of opposition within 20 years.

There is a long way to go just to reach that second place. The Lib Dems have ended March with 87,000 members — a mere smattering compared with Labour’s half a million. But where Labour is losing thousands of members each month, the Lib Dems are gaining them at a similar rate.

Unlike many of Labour’s new joiners, Lib Dems don’t sit at home plotting civil war online. Instead they get out and campaign for votes.

Labour is too divided to oppose the government effectively. Corbyn ordered his MPs to vote for withdrawal from the European Union. Perhaps the darkest comedy of last week’s article 50 exchanges came when the Tories’ Sir William Cash, the triumphant former Eurosceptic rebel, found Corbyn’s mild criticisms “breathtaking” because “from Maastricht onwards he voted with us over and over and over again”.

A reminder of Corbyn’s true Bennite view of the EU was splashed incongruously across The New York Times in an opinion column by a veteran of the New Left Review who described it as “an oligarchic structure, riddled with corruption, built on a denial of any sort of popular sovereignty, enforcing a bitter economic regime of privilege for the few and duress for the many”. The struggle goes on, comrade.

Those following the money should note that in the last quarter of 2016 the Lib Dems narrowly overtook Labour in donations (£1,972,904 to £1,970,055) thanks largely to £1m from the media millionaire Gregory Nasmyth. It’s no secret that other centre-left, pro-Europe business donors are now wondering if their stakes would be better placed on yellow rather than red.

Brexit has given the Lib Dems what they needed: a big defining issue to campaign on. It is the only UK party unswervingly committed to the EU — not a bad position for an opposition party to be in considering that a substantial minority of the public, 48%, voted to remain in the union.

Farron is safe in the knowledge that he will not be the first minister of anywhere soon so he can offer the electorate the full gamut of pro-European policies from the moderate “It is still possible for the British people to stop a hard Brexit and keep us in the single market” to the high-octane “It is still possible for the British people to [choose to] remain in the European Union.”

Like Tony Blair, the Lib Dems accept that the UK could stay in the EU only if the public changes its mind. There is no indication of that happening. A Sky Data poll on the day of article 50 found 50% were “happy” that the process of withdrawal was at last under way with only 36% feeling “sad”.

A palpable turnaround in the mood would require unlikely shifts in two categories of opinion. “Leavers” would have to admit they had made a mistake — always hard to do. “Remainers” who believe that the will of the majority as expressed in the referendum must be respected would also have to overturn their principles.

Prospects are grim if the priority is to keep Britain in the EU, less so for Lib Dems trying to rebuild their power base. The party has always drawn its support roughly 50-50 from people who like what it stands for and people who are just protesting against whoever is in government (particularly the Tories). That’s why going into the coalition government was such a disaster and why Farron can now say with a straight face that the party is picking up support from both leavers and remainers.

The Lib Dems, with their Janus-like attitude, can hope to be a significant disruptive force in the upcoming Manchester Gorton by-election where they are in distant second place behind Labour but where 62% voted to remain in the EU. At the same time the fear that the Lib Dems could recapture many of the seats in the Eurosceptic West Country, cannibalised by David Cameron to win his majority in 2015, is one of the strongest arguments in Tory circles against a snap election.

The latest analysis of council voting patterns by Professor Michael Thrasher ahead of this year’s local elections finds the Lib Dems well up. National equivalent vote share compared with four years ago is Conservatives 31% (+5), Labour 29% (no change), Lib Dems 22% (+9) and Ukip 10% (-12).

If the votes are cast that way on May 4 the Lib Dem party will reclaim its place as the third force in English politics from Ukip while Labour will have another poor set of results.

The next crucial vote on Britain in the EU will come if and when the May government and Michel Barnier’s EU team agree a Brexit deal. That gives the Lib Dems two years to harry the government on an issue that matters to them profoundly.

The Lib Dems are not alone. They are in touch and making common cause on Europe with like-minded political opponents — from Michael Heseltine and George Osborne on the Tory side to Blair and many of his disillusioned protégés still under Corbyn’s yoke. They take it as a badge of honour that “with their pathetic little rump of MPs and pygmy leadership” they have merited a full editorial denunciation as “the real enemies within” by the Daily Mail.

The irrepressible Farron can no more resist a fight than he can a pun — the OmNICshambles budget was just one of his howlers. But in truth the Lib Dems have two leaders now that their suave Brexit spokesman, a reinvigorated Nick Clegg, has shaken off the depression of being Cameron’s underdog.

Neither of them wants to go back to their constituencies and prepare for government. Been there, done that, disaster. To travel hopefully can be better than to arrive.

This is the correct answer.

It's definitely more useful to learn Dari with Afghans than Pashto. Hazaras are overrepresented in the Afghan refugee diaspora, and they speak Dari (or more specifically, a dialect of Dari known as Hazaragi). Most Pashtuns can speak Dari, too. Pashto is spoken by some non-Pashtuns, but it's just less common than the other way around. 

In fact, I've only ever met one Afghan who could speak Pashto and not Dari - and that's because she was raised abroad.

Du coup, je bouffe des livres, je cherche des trucs sur Internet et ayant croisé une enième asso humanitaire vers Montparnasse, j'ai passé une petite journée à faire de la recherche sur le sujet apres avoir regardé un documentaire sur les origines de GreenPeace, l'association étant maintenant allègrement critiqué par certains pour son cote anticapitalisme, par d'autres pour son manque de radicalité.

Je balance la liste des liens ici. C'est susceptible d'intéresser les gens. Ca touche au monde de fonctionnement des ONG, notamment sur le système de Street Funding apparu dans les années 2000. Ca évoque les sociétés sur ce ""marché"" du caritatif. 
Il y a quelques autres articles sur différentes associations ainsi que deux articles d'un même auteur, plus critique mais aussi plus sourcé quant à la pertinence des actions humanitaires

Ce qu'il faut retenir: certaines entreprises vendent à aux ONG des campagnes de streetfunding. Le cout est d'environ 70 000 euros pour 5 semaines. Ils recuperent 500 donateurs par campagnes. Chaque donateur coute du coup environ 120 euros a recruter. Il devient rentable au bout d'un peu plus d'un an de don selon la somme qu'il donne.

Les gens dans la rue, a part pour greenpeace et medecin sans frontiere qui forme ses propres equipes de street funding sont remuneres par ces entreprises comme par exemple ong conseil qui les remunerent pour un salaire un peu superieur au smic, pour 35h par semaine. 

C'est Greenpeace a priori qui aurait lance ce mode de levee de fond. L'un des objectif etait de se rapprocher de la jeunesse, moins abordable par les moyens historiques qu'etaient la prospection par courier et telephonique.


Pour tout ce qui est scandales. On retrouve globalement la necessite pour les organisations de realiser des compromis afin de s'implanter dans les pays. On trouve aussi des problemes de gouvernance, d'abus salariaux dans certains cas, des conflits d'interet entre l'aide apportée qui concurrence alors le developement local ( tant de l'entreprenariat que du commerce ). Il y a aussi l'influence de certaines associations ideologiques. Le financement soumis parfois a des contraintes geopolitiques.

&gt;if this is an issue of self determination, then arabs have it in 22 states; if this is about citizenship, then why have arabs revokes their citizenship and made them stateless?

It's about both. It's about a group of people wanting self determination on the land their grandparents lived in. The argument is that if your going to say fuck their wishes you better make room for them inside your country.

&gt;agreed; so why is one side still stuck 50 years in the past (1967)?

Maybe because the occupation and land grab is still continuing? Maybe because homes are still being demolished and palestinians refused permits. Maybe because the only deals Israel offered them means a palestine in a handful of pieces surrounded by Israeli checkpoints. As well as giving up vital resources necessary for a state to survive.

Most jews haven't stepped foot in Israel for thousands of years or at all even yet that doesn't exclude their right of return and self determination.

&gt;what? most americans immigrated and settled, Canadian cities are settlements, you live in a settlement.

And what did those countries do (after severely fucking the natives up in brutal ways) we/they granted a right of return and the freedom to move anywhere in the country they wish full citizenship and even benefits not enjoyed by the rest of the country.

Plus most people aren't running around arguing that America and Canada and europe did nothing wrong then.

&gt;'settlement' isn't pejorative anywhere in the world.. except for when jews are the ones settling, right?

When did I use it as an insult? They call themselves that. And I would argue settling is bad anytime its done anywhere that isn't a land without a people.

&gt;that's your take on it; I don't see it as a question of morality.

Then don't whine when people say Israel are moralless bastards.

t3_62w5j2,t5_2rd6n,"While the actual experience of war is relatively unknown to those living in colonies throughout the rest of the Solar System, it's a daily reality for those living on Earth.

For the elves, men, dwarves and other magical peoples living in Earth's atmosphere, the war effort permeates everything. Daemons, twisted into irrational killing machines by the Curse, flood through into Berlin by the minute. 

They control much of Europe and the Middle East, and their strange ability to reverse-engineer the technology used to slaughter them has led to a stalemate where nukes are outlawed, that pits the superior tactics and orbital weapons of the United Nations fleet against the overwhelming numbers possessed by the Legions of Hell.

Battles are decided kilometers above the land or sea by massive 'naval' ships (pumped out day and night by 3D printing factories in the Asteroid belt) that levitate through the use of anti-gravity crystals mined from floating islands. These ships (depending on class) can carry hangars full of drone fighters, dropships, dragons, and gunships, attack from long range with huge ballistic missiles, or are equipped with massive railguns capable of demolishing mountains with a single shot.

Fleets have near-constant prescense anywhere a friendly interdimensional jump beacon is deployed, travelling vast distances in minutes, using a complicated process involving mages creating pocket dimensions and the stretching of spacetime.

The same system of combat is used on every scale - high-velocity electromagnetic weapons such as gauss guns and railguns are countered by the semi-magical 'shields' that everything, from 2km-long battleships to infantry troopers possess, which are countered in turn by melee weapons sheathed in molecular disruption fields.

Each race has their own style of military strategy and design. Dwarven heavy infantry stalks ship decks in hulking mechsuits, bristling with heavy weaponry. Sleek elven ships are built around a singular, monstrous, railgun. Human governments hire out military contractors, brave treasure hunters who finance their own gear and prove deadly adversaries in single combat.

t3_62v77c,t5_2qh68,"We have a pretty terrible record when it comes to First Nations; one need look no further than the residential school system, or to the insanely disproportionate incarceration rates of Indigenous people presently.

If you look further into the past, it's only worse: John A Mcdonald's administration committed genocide to clear the prairies for European settlement. There were large amounts of indigenous peoples living there at that time, in prime locations. They were on the cusp of starving due to the depletion of the bison herds, and desperately signed the number treaties allowing European settlement in exchange for rations and European help in taking up agriculture.

 Mcdonald's government, instead of actually helping the natives, used the rations as leverage to coerce them to moving to reserves so that Europeans could take up the prime real estate. Once on the reservations the rations were often left to rot behind locked doors instead of being given to the natives - Mcdonald actually bragged at one point about keeping the natives on the verge of famine. Rampant tuberculosis and other diseases followed.

The reserves they moved them to often didn't have good soil for farming, farming tools mostly weren't provided to the natives, and in one case when a group of natives were actually successful at farming, their farming tools were taken away as they ""threatened the prosperity"" of Europeans. So he basically didn't keep any of the promises of the treaty and was over all a pretty horrible human being, though this is all par the course for how Canada has treated the indigenous peoples.

t3_62osql,t5_2zmfe,"The French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between the Kingdom of France and the powerful Holy Roman Empire. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[49] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.

Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu reinforced the centralisation of the state, royal power and French dominance in Europe, foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France, which was at that time at war with Spain. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in France.

Louis XIV of France standing in plate armor and blue sash facing left holding baton
Louis XIV, the ""sun king"" was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power.
The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[50] France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.

Under Louis XV, Louis XIV's grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763. Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[51][52]

Louis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realised in the Treaty of Paris (1783)). The financial crisis that followed France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.

t1_dfpsn68,t5_2sxhs,"Here's a brief-ish explanation of how it works.

Individual EU citizens are represented by their MEP in the European Parliament.

Individual nations are represented on the European Council, usually by their head of state or government.

The Commission is slightly more complicated. Firstly the European Council nominates a candidate for President of the Commission, and then the EU Parliament has to vote to approve them. Once this happens, the Commissioner must appoint the members of the Commission. For this you must have one member from each state. The EU Parliament must then approve of the Commission as a whole, not approving just individual commissioners. If they approve it then we move on, if not the process is repeated.

Legislation is proposed by the Commission (Of which every member state has representation on), and is then put forward to the EU Parliament, and the Council of the European Union (Note: NOT ""the European Council"" or ""the Council of Europe"") and if they both agree it is put  forward into law. 

The Council of the EU is made up of the Foreign Minister/Minister for the EU of each member state, they each get one vote but that vote is worth more depending on the population of the member state.

So the way it works is: The Commission proposes legislation which generally has to be in the interest of the EU as whole, this is then voted on by each member state by their foreign/EU minister, as well as by MEPs. So what this means is that legislation not only has to be favoured by a majority of the people of Europe but also a majority of member states.

So by this method, everyone who matters in EU legislation is either directly elected or appointed by someone who was elected. The exact same way pretty much every democratic government works. 

To answer your specific questions

&gt; In fact, they can hardly say ""no"" on anything the Commission votes on

On the contrary, they have to approve anything proposed by the Commission before it can become law, and in fact they have considerable influence on who's in the Commission in the first place.

&gt; but if the Commissioners wanted to be total assholes, they could just deny every request the Parliament makes?

Technically they could, but that wouldn't make much sense. The President of the Commission is supposed to represent the largest party in the EU Parliament, so they would have a pretty good level of support in Parliament and vice versa. Plus any Commission that did this probably wouldn't find themselves having much chance of a 2nd term.

And in anycase, I don't see how this is different to vetoes that most countries have, including the US. If Trump ends up with a Democrat majority in the mid-terms (assuming he's still President by then), what's to stop him vetoing literally everything they propose? If the Dems had less than 2/3 majority and assuming partisanship remains the same, there's precisely jack shit they could do to stop him.",11,jesse9o3,place,1491111605,0,True,place-3,t3_62v92l,False,dfpusdg,1491106679,"(83,290) 1491235809.45",,0,1493721366,

You don't think his anger is somewhat warranted if the way you locate a missing child in some parts of the UK is find the queue of pakistani men outside a house waiting their turn to gang-rape them?

You don't think it's warranted when you find out hundreds of children are just ""missing"" and some might have died from being raped for 4 days straight?

Suppressors were invented in [1902 and patented as early as 1909.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor) Your statement is an argument in favor of repealing the NFA inclusion in any case, as stupid knee-jerk laws ought to be repealed on general principal.

&gt;If one were proposing to do a drive by, and one could fire suppressed or non-suppressed, I submit that the rational monster would choose to fire suppressed.

Maybe, but does that effect the lethality with respect to the victims? I'm sure the shooters would prefer to use a car with a working muffler as well.

&gt;Well, it's a trade off. What exactly is the risk? How much damage is done? How much damage can you prove is done annually by sound from unsuppressed firearms. Once you have that figure, we have to balance that against what we can reasonably project are the safety benefits of loud reports.

---

&gt;* Tillerson was attending his first meeting of NATO foreign ministers amid worries about U.S. President Donald Trump's stated desire for closer relations with Moscow.

&gt;* Russia responded by accusing NATO of spreading ""the myth of a 'Russian threat'"" and ""the slander of 'Russian aggression'"" as a way to unify its members.

&gt;* Also on March 31, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told reporters in London that ""Russian's violations of international law are now a matter of record -- from what happened with Crimea to other aspects of their behavior in mucking around inside other peoples' elections.""

&gt;* The comments came after U.S. General Curtis Scaparrotti, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, told a U.S. Senate committee on March 23 that he had seen evidence of increasing Russian efforts to influence the Taliban ""and perhaps even to supply"" the militant group.

&gt;* ""Many countries"" maintain contacts with the Taliban, Grushko said, adding that ""the consultations we hold, the work we do, we do it with the participation of Afghanistan's central government.""

&gt; Meat Loaf (born Marvin Lee Aday on September 27, 1947 in Dallas, Texas) is an American actor and rock and roll performer who came to fame with his album Bat Out of Hell and for his movie performances, including Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Robert ""Bob"" Paulson  in Fight Club and Jack Black's father in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. 

&gt; Meat Loaf has had a very successful music career spawning some of the greatest selling albums of all time and breaking various records. Although he enjoyed success with Jim Steinman's Bat Out Of Hell Trilogy, he experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States; however, he is considered a legend in the UK and across Europe. In the UK, he is ranked 23rd for number of weeks in the charts overall. Due to his anthemic songs and a performance for Radio Veronica in the Netherlands, he stormed up their Top 100 of all times making a top 10 spot 6 years in a row. He ranks at 96th on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock."" His overall success in Europe and Australia has been exceptional and he is considered one of the top artists of all time.

There's a badass shop in the 9th called [La Pédale](https://maps.google.fr/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=fr&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ftid=0x47e66e46728dc259:0xe3a7923e306c35af&amp;gmm=CgIgAQ%3D%3D) that sell so many cool pedals. They're your best bet if you want to see a cool Parisian boutique. In that area there are a ton of music stores too, and the moulin rouge is there so you see it too. Just be mideful of your surroundings, it's a little shady. 

There's another cool place that I go to a lot called [woodbrass](https://maps.google.fr/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=fr&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ftid=0x47e66dc84fe7c045:0xfa92f9de77903a60&amp;gmm=CgIgAQ%3D%3D), but they're just you're run of the mill music store. They have 5 locations in the same little area- brass, guitars/effects, drums, winds, and dj. I go because they have a ton of stock and are the only ones open Monday. 

There's a new place called [the effect factory](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/The+Effect+Factory,+23+Rue+Violet,+75015+Paris/@48.8504332,2.2954785,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e670229ca6dd89:0xbe7cc733c7fa461b?hl=en) that I went to about a month ago to get some solderless cables. They're the only ones in Paris who sell them. They only do ""boutique"" and have some pretty cool stuff- EQD, Alexander, Chase Bliss, OBNE...but nothing that la pédale wouldn't have. Plus it's not far from from the Eiffel Tower.

t1_dfpnq7i,t5_2r7pg,"I watch every SBK/WSS race, and I'm glad the European classes are starting too today. However, I'm not sure what you're saying is entirely accurate for this season. Rea has won every race so far. Davies tries, but crashes - even if he does win the occasional race, he won't challenge for the title like this. It removes the tension from the title championship. The Yamaha riders aren't mixing it with the frontrunners: they're clearly still a step behind the Kawasaki and Ducati bikes. Further back, it's hit or miss for the riders and even if they do engage in hot battle, it's only shown on camera for a couple of moments. 

I love watching the races, but World Superbikes completely lacks tension at the moment. During the MotoGP Qatar round, it was a wild affair to watch: beforehand no-one knew what Lorenzo would do; for the first few laps we all wondered how far Zarco would get; then it appeared Viñales and Marquez would struggle and Dovi might win; Rossi got from nowhere to podium and Viñales came through afterall in a proper battle. 

Compare that to, for instance, the SBK races where Davies and Rea are out in front, separated by a few tenths, they fight a few times and one of them wins. Everyone knows that's how most races are going to play out this season. A few tracks will allow for some more interesting races, but you just don't get that rollercoaster feeling in World Superbikes at the moment.

Sure, I could only marry the smartest people with the smartest people, but eventually you'll run into the same problems the European royal families have marrying royalty only with royalty. 

Odd you bring up selective bred dogs which have proven things you are claiming to be false. Ask just about anyone, professional or laymen, and they will be able to tell you some breeds of dogs are smarter than others as well as have other different traits both desired or unwanted with none of them being a product of 'environment.' otherwise please tell me how to turn my chihuahua into a champion Iditarod sled dog through environment alone.

Theoretically given two 'perfectly healthy' related specimens they could inbreed with no ill effects. The reason why inbreeding yields health issues is because those health issues are present in both the male and female resulting in a 'strengthening' of those health issues that would otherwise have a much higher chance of being diluted by mating with someone far outside their line since its less likely they also have that health issue. For example hemophilia was passed in royal families not because inbreeding 'developed' this condition, but because progenitors earlier in the line already had it or were carriers. When two carriers of hemophilia have offspring they are essentially 'doubling down' on that trait making it more likely to express itself. Obviously if you do this repeatedly in subsequent generations the chances go up sharply.

Inbreeding doesn't manifest health issues as if inbreeding is inherently unhealthy and will spontaneously yield health problems. Its unhealthy because shared negative traits have little to no chance of being phased out.

Genes determine potential and environment determines the exploitation of that potential. Someone capable of being a world class astrophysicist could end up a car mechanic while another could become an average mathematician but only by reaching the very upper limits of their cognitive abilities.",6,stevegossman82,AskReddit,1491120369,0,True,,t3_62x5m7,False,dfpzzta,1491119146,,,0,1493723877,

&gt; “Loyle Carner is Britains most recent new hope in hip hop,” according to The Fader and countless others. The 20 year old emcee from South London has been causing quite a stir following the release of his debut ‘A Little Late’ EP in September of last year. All but one track on the EP was produced by Loyle’s right hand man and live partner Rebel Kleff. The two of them create reminiscent old school hip hop with their own UK and modern influences. 

&gt; After first appearing in 2013 on Rejjie Snow’s ‘Rejovich’ EP on track ‘1992’, Loyle’s name started to make the rounds, not least to mention the track being picked up by Majestic Casual and has racked up over 700k views to date. Following the release of the ‘A Little Late’ EP, Loyle has gone on to work with the likes of Kate Tempest, Maverick Sabre, Tom Misch and multiple others, all in preparation for releases in 2015. 

&gt; With two successful UK tours now under his belt with Joey Bada$$ and Atmosphere, Loyle is set to make some serious moves on the UK circuit and abroad, with strong support coming from all over Europe, the US and Australia. Support in the UK has come from all areas, being championed on Radio 1Xtra by DJ Semtex and Phil Taggart, Huw Stephens and Lauren Laverne at Radio 1. His latest single with Kate Tempest was added to 6Music’s B-list and then bumped up to the A-List immediately after a week and has not stopped being played.

t3_6238e7,t5_2tmcb,"Heidegger and Arendt have naught to do with the Frankfurt School. The controversy on antisemitism in Eichmann in Jersalem relies on the following:

- Hannah Arendt reports rumors that Himmler was a Jewish himself. This is false.

- In her personal letters it gets clear she harboured ressentiments towards oriental and eastern european Jews (throwing notions around as ""the typical galician ghetto Jew"" for the prosecution, ""kaftan Jews"" and ""the oriental mob"" for Israel in general) which also is implicit in the text of the book (see the first chapter).

- perhaps to make sure that her book is controversial she drops some nicely quotable sentences on ""Jewish death-squads"". This kind of a 4chan troll's antisemitism is similar what was done by Simone de Beauvor in the Second Sex and by Jean Paul Sartre in his book on Antisemitism. All three would drop some nicely quotable sentences which are outrageously antisemitic when taken out of context, perhaps to ensure a succès de scandale.

- In her letters it does become clear that she intended to harsh on the Jews before she even  started writing the the articles to ensure it will not be ignored as yet another Jewish text on Jewish matters.

- in the articles she reports rumors on East Germany and the Eastern Block in general employing some very particular nazi criminals, which is also demonstrably false. East Germany has been much more harsh on the fascists than West Germany and claims like this were likely ought to preclude accusations of sympathies towards the communists which would have resulted from her very critical treatment of post-war West Germany. Thus her criticism of the Western attitudes towards former fascists is relativised by the concluding remark everybody is doing it.

- She drops a notice that Stalin era USSR might have been as bad or worse, which is false.

- She is not a historian and relies from time to time on outdated sources.

- She takes Eichmann's defense in court at face value discounting his openness about his antisemitism in the Sassen interview as mere bravado. 

- She did support Heidegger after him publishing his nazi-era materials and refusing to recant. What recently made things worse is that his recently published notebooks prove beyond reasonable doubt that he indeed meant it and wasn't just trying paying lip service to the regime.

In all in all there were plenty reasons for the Jewish community and academics to be appalled about Arendt. As for her, she may have regarded herself not as a scholar but as a public intellectual perhaps trying to make some significant point at a time when both Soviet and American mathematicians where doing calculus for the delivery of nuclear warheads to enemy population centers. Drawing, sloppily at that, on  the holocaust to that end of course was bound to offend a plenty of people.",0,dieLaunischeForelle,CriticalTheory,1491120469,0,True,,t3_6238e7,False,dfq09l2,1491119976,,,0,1493724006,

t1_dfpz5jb,t5_2w3z3,"There really is no abbreviated way to answer this. Let me try and do my best. Spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't finished The Ringed City:

The world of Dark Souls has existed long before the story starts. But its relevance begins at the dawn of man. The reigning beings in the world were once dragons, until Lord Gwyn, his four knights (Artorias, Ornstein, Ciaran, and Gough) along with special help from a traitorous dragon (Seath the Scaleless) used lightning to destroy most of them and conquer the world. Another helper, referred to only as the ""furtive pygmy,"" received, as his reward, something called ""the dark soul of man."" What, exactly, this is has been left ambiguous throughout the series. All that is known is that the furtive pygmy was the first man, and that ultimately, the dark soul was divided among all his descendents, and that all men possess the capability for dark.

Dark Souls 1: You begin as a nameless hollow rotting away in a prison cell. A kindly knight on his own mission, sensing something special about you, and needing your help, drops you a key to get out. Unfortunately, he dies before we learn much, and we are left to wander the world. We kill demons, Gods, and men, not really knowing why, until we stumble across a war between two Bible-esque serpents who have differing agendas on how the world should proceed. Essentially, the world of Dark Souls turns out to revolve around an old European myth that posited that every year, a God claimed the throne of men, and every winter he died. Basically, you must ""link the fire"" to preserve the current age, or let it fall to dark, which becomes ""the age of men."" Whether or not this a good thing is ambiguously up to you.

DS2: You are an afflicted hollow, burdened with the curse of the Undead. You wound up in this land, ostensibly thousands of years after the first Dark Souls, seeking a cure for your maladay. It turns out that you, and nearly every one you encounter, have lost your memories of your previous lives, and you are ultimately strayed away from your original goal to cure yourself and roped into a plot revolving around a mad king who was corrupted by an evil queen, and coerced into taking the throne yourself. To what end? No one really knows, but you look pretty cool doing it. A girl who is the daughter of a dragon and a really gross looking pile of shit who has experimented on all the world's creatures and created some really Frankenstein-esque things are the warring factions, and you become a pawn of them both. The major point in this game, as far as it's relevant to DS3, is that the Age of Fire exists in cycles -- Gwyn, the final boss of DS1, was the first to ""link the fire."" Ostensibly, your character from DS1 was the second. Here, there have been many cycles, and your character, for whatever reason, is the ""chosen one"" in the current one you exist in.

DS3: Thousands and thousands of years after DS2, the fire is finally fading, and possibly for good. Crying out for someone to light it, ""unkindled"" corpses begin to rise from their graves, *Night of the Living Dead* style, as the fire attempts to draw a champion of ash to relight it. You are one such ""unkindled,"" someone unfit even to burn correctly. This game exists in a near-apocalyptic state, where the fire is desperate, and attempts to recall Lords of Cinder (those who have linked the flame in past cycles -- think of them as alternate realities of your DS1 and 2 characters) to sit on their thrones and combine their strength to reignite this fading flame, sparing the world from plunging into chaos. They refuse, because most of them have gone hollow reliving their former lives -- one is a legion of soldiers who have resorted to ""defending"" a worthless toxic swamp as though it is a valiant kingdom; one is a giant obsessed with its former glory who presides over a kingdom of death and filth; one is a madman obsessed with devouring men and gods and becoming one himself; one is a frail, weak boy who cares more about defending his valiant, crippled older brother than he does about cyclical flame-linking nonsense. When they are all dead, and their ashes returned to their thrones, you are able to finally find the weak fire, which is defended by an amalgam of previous champions, but that looks and behaves unmistakably like the player character from Dark Souls 1. Upon defeating it, you can link the flame or let it burn out, or some variation on the two.

Meanwhile, a young dragon crossbreed girl attempts to paint a *new* world, unaffected by these cycles. You can, optionally, travel to the final apocalyptic frontier, where the world, in its last throes, has begun to implode and pull ancient lands and beings from various timelines into itself, creating a bizarre amalgam that you traverse to find the original Dark Soul, to give to the painter girl, to create a new world to escape to before the one you're in caves in upon itself. If you choose this path, you, a worthless undead, and a slave knight, also set to help reimagine this new world in *his* own image, race against each other to find the Dark Soul until you and he are the only last living things left alive in the world. The old gods are all dead, the dragons are all dead, the firekeepers and their forebears all dead.

Its a bit more complicated than that, its not just representing money we should get from other bodies, as far as I am aware the CAP credits are difficult to apply to us full-stop as our agricultural industries are structured differently to those on the continent.  The actual rebate though was introduced when they started to request a portion of VAT, as our VAT take is higher than other countries (&amp; the CAP problems above) we were allowed a discount.

&gt;For that reason it's perfectly valid to talk about that whole £350M being freed up if we leave the EU.

Well thats a whole different question, is it valid?

So I believe even if the article is all bullshit, why *are* Leavers so angry at their opponents? I could spin a yarn about how it might be how some of the promises of the Leave campaigns, some more than others, have turned out to be utter falsehoods (such as our continued membership of the single market, or the now infamous £350 million a week figure, to name but two) but I won't. I could suggest that it might have something to do with the fact that Brexiteers seemed to believe that their opponents would fall dead silent and would not continue to hold their opinion after the result, and as much was demanded of them almost immediately, despite the fact that the Leave side did no such thing after the referendum to join the EU and has not ceased doing so for fourty years, but I won't.  
  
Without really wishing to argue with you (because you and I have argued on the subject of the EU, and it always goes the same way, so lets' not re-tread paths well-walked) I'd instead like to offer a suggestion as to an idea that might explain it, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.  
  
The idea is thus: I think the idea has dawned, admittedly long before now, among those that voted for Leave or who voted for Remain but have since changed their minds, that we are depending on our leaders to get us a decent send-off from the EU. These leaders are the same leaders who totally failed to get a renegotiation from the first attempt just before the referendum, and there's no significant evidence to suggest that anything since that time has changed.  
  
Additionally, whether we end up with trade agreements up to our nostrils with other worldwide nations or none whatsoever, this segment of negotiation, which we are entrusting to the same people who utterly failed the first time, will play a factor in deciding how strongly we will be percived by that non-EU outside world, and which will in turn have, in the short term at minimum, an effect on the trade talks we do participate in outside the EU which will affect how favourable they can or will be for us.

t3_62wdl5,t5_38unr,"Here's how I think this will go, if Europe does not change course

1. Muslim families will continue to have atleast a half dozen children **each**, whilst native families will have at most a few or none

2. With more representation, they will start to elect muslims in higher positions of power, starting from the bottom up. We are already seeing a Muslim mayor in London, who has rumored ties to terrorist organizations

3. At first, they will do the usual Taqiyya to quell fears. But the result will eventually come to frutition, Sharia Law.

4. ""No go zones"" will grow and continue growing. The entirety of Malmo, Sweden could be considered a no-go zone in itself.

5. With the ""urbanized natives"" in the cities, I.E. the most ""cucked"" or ""weakest and unwilling to confront this violent issue"" they will either be forced to move, forced to convert, or will become another statistic.


The end result will be that which has been seen in many majority Muslim countries. As their percentage of the population grows, so does the violence. Eventually, there will be a point where violent confrontation between the native population and the non-native Muslim population **is inevitable**

Being on the ""right side of history"" is irrelevant when you do not know history at all. This has happened in many other Islamic nations and the outcome has **always been the same** without exception. Sometimes the percentage of Muslims in a country does not grow, and mass, state-run violence occurs at about 50%.


Most importantly, for those virtue-signaling reading this, ignoring the problem makes it worse. All across Europe and America there are mosques that are radicalizing the youth, who will in turn radicalize all half dozen of their children. Put ""moderate"" muslims on a pedestal all you want, they will not try to help you if you're sent to get fucking beheaded for being gay.

&gt; Spain has said it would not veto an attempt by an independent Scotland to join the EU, in a boost to Nicola Sturgeon&amp;#039;s campaign for a second independence referendum and the clearest sign yet that Brexit has softened Madrid&amp;#039;s longstanding opposition.

&gt; Asked directly whether Spain would veto an independent Scotland joining the EU, Dastis said: &amp;quot;No, we wouldn&amp;#039;t.""

&gt; In the run-up to Scotland&amp;#039;s 2014 independence referendum, Rajoy said Scottish independence would be a catastrophe that would risk Europe&amp;#039;s disintegration, but the political calculus in Madrid and Brussels has shifted since Britain voted to leave the EU. EU leaders are more sympathetic to Scotland, where 62% voted to remain in the EU, while insisting that Scots cannot inherit Britain&amp;#039;s EU membership.

&gt;Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has indicated that she intends to do everything in her power **to keep Scotland within the EU** following the UK’s decision to leave on 23 June.

t3_62yww9,t5_2qhjz,"Quatre députées italiennes souhaitent permettre aux femmes ayant des règles douloureuses de bénéficier de trois jours de congés mensuels. Une proposition quelque peu controversée.

Véritable avancée pour les femmes ou fausse bonne idée ? La proposition de quatre députées italiennes de permettre aux femmes ayant des règles douloureuses de prendre trois jours de congés payés par mois, payés à 100% de leur salaire, ne fait pas l'unanimité.

En Italie, pourtant, entre 60% et 90% des femmes seraient atteintes de dysménorrhée, selon la version italienne de ""Marie-Claire"", citée par LCI. Selon une étude menée par l'Université de Birmingham, une femme sur cinq en souffrirait dans le monde. Des maux de ventre, mal au dos ou nausées qui sont parfois si intenses que la personne ne peut pas se déplacer pour aller au travail et doit prendre des calmants.


Une mesure discriminatoire ?

Présentée mi-mars, la proposition de loi doit être débattue au Parlement dans les mois à venir. Elle prévoit que, pour pouvoir toucher leur salaire à 100%, les Italiennes devront fournir un certificat médical annuel. Cette mesure concernera les femmes ayant un contrat de travail à temps plein ou partiel, à durée déterminée ou indéterminée. Selon L'Obs, le congé menstruel pourrait être financé par la Sécurité sociale italienne.

Mais, en Italie comme dans d'autres pays, la mesure ne fait pas l'unanimité. Si le ""Marie-Claire"" italien y voit un ""porte-étendard du progrès et de la durabilité sociale"", certaines féministes craignent que cela incite les employeurs à embaucher un homme plutôt qu'une femme, à compétences égales. En France, la porte-parole d'Osez le féminisme, Céline Piques, estime que cette mesure pourrait contribuer à stigmatiser un peu plus les femmes qui ""payent déjà à l'embauche la présomption de grossesse"". Selon elle, cela ne ferait aussi que renforcer en entreprise les clichés sexistes , notamment ceux liés aux menstruations.

L'exemple japonais

Certains détracteurs du congé menstruel remettent également en doute l'efficacité d'une telle mesure. Au Japon, véritable précurseur sur le sujet, avec une mise en place dès 1947, les femmes n'y ont pourtant que très rarement recours. Seuls 13% des Japonaises faisaient valoir leur droit à ce congé en 1981, contre 20% en 1960, révélait une étude menée dans les années 1980 par la chercheuse, Alice J.Dan, rappelle Europe 1.

Dans la foulée du Japon, l'Indonésie a adopté le congé menstruel en 1948. En 2001, c'était au tour de la Corée du Sud, puis, en 2013, Taïwan. Enfin, la Zambie l'a mis en place en 2015, non sans déclencher, là aussi, une polémique.

Des salariées trois fois plus productives

Certaines entreprises proposent également ce type de congé à leurs salariées. À l'image de Nike qui, en 2007, l'a inscrit dans son code de conduite. Depuis 2016, l'entreprise britannique Coexist l'a également adopté. Ce complexe événementiel et artistique de Bristol propose à ses employées - au nombre de 17 sur un effectif de 24 - soit de travailler à domicile, soit de prendre deux jours de repos rémunérés. L'expérimentation a montré qu'une fois leur cycle terminé, les salariées sont trois fois plus productives, assure la codirectrice de Coexist, Bex Baxter.

Aucune entreprise française ne semble avoir pour l'instant pris une telle disposition. Au niveau national, la question du congé menstruel n'a pas non plus été encore abordée. Une bonne chose pour certaines féministes : ""Au lieu de cette mesure spécifique, il vaudrait mieux améliorer la prise en charge médicale des règles douloureuses et investir davantage dans la lutte contre les discriminations au travail à l'égard des femmes"", déclarait ainsi récemment Sophie Binet, en charge de l'égalité hommes/femmes à la CGT, à 20 minutes.",7,Nepou,france,False,0,True,chefshadok,t3_62yww9,False,dfq2fq6,1491127658,Chef Shadok,,0,1493725052,

t1_dfq1j6x,t5_2s113,"Hey,

just a few things here:

&gt; Remember that people grinding XP were doing it based on a guess. WG is not breaking any promise here because they never said the XP would move up.

You are correct that WG by themselves never announced anything regarding this. Not even now. There is no official announcement how the changes are going to be done (afaik). But what they did: They left their media outlets (e.g. QB) in the dark so those would most likely jump to the conclusion based on previous changes like this. This is passively creating intransparency and this is ALWAYS bad for the customer.

The reasoning of leaving XP is flat out simple:

- Free xp conversion. WG's business intelligence department has the numbers for the ingame economy. This might be simply based on those numbers. At least on EU there was a special with 1gold -&gt; 35 free xp. This hints at WG's goals.

- They want to control the pace. This way there is an endgame to the LT topic and if they screwed up balancing it takes longer to show.

Overall I think the solution from c could have been easily implemented (it's just another if else condition on the migration script). I think the nail in the coffin is going to be if they are also going to retrain crews back to the LT8 like they did on the common test server. If they do this on live, WG deserves a lot of flack.

Oh and one last thing: Their base of judgement is wrong. They should not have checked how much xp players currently have on their lights but how much players accumulated since the announcement.",1,brtz,WorldofTanks,False,0,True,,t3_62yn2m,False,dfq2lmd,1491128263,,,0,1493725131,

t3_62xg2v,t5_3d4x4,"The difference is even greater than that, OP. China's per capita GDP is around $8000 in fixed nominal terms(indexed to year 2010). India's at 1800 or so. [Look at the World Bank data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=IN-CN).

The reason why nominal GDP is preferable to PPP, is because PPP will shrink as time goes on. This is called the price-level index or PI for short. To give an example. Let's say you're at $1800 per capita in nominal terms. Your PI may be only 0.3. That will give you 1800/0.3= 6000 USD in PPP terms. 

However, as you get richer, your PI will go up. Most rich countries have a PI around 0.8 to 1.2. That's why nominal GDP is a better indicator for *long term* thinking. Because you can't count on your PI being as low as it is right now, which gives India a higher PPP deflator then it will 20-30 years down the line. 

So, India is around 5X lower than China on a per capita basis. Even at 10% growth, assuming population grows at 1% per year in the long run, would give you 10K per capita 20 years down the line. The US is at 52K when using indexed dollars(to avoid inflation and currency movements distorting the underlying picture). Even many poorer Eastern European countries, *today* are above that. 

Plus, given the winds of protectionism and the fact that India's demographic dividend is about to peak within the next few years(as outlined in this year's Economic Survey), sustaining 10% growth is a pipe dream. It's not even desirable. Look at how much China is gorging on massive debt to sustain their growth. They are turning themselves into another Japan, but at much lower incomes.

India can sustainbly grow at 7%+ for 20-30 years, but even that will not be easy. This is because India massively underinvested in human capital since independence and so far Modi has barely moved the needle on the issue. Instead he removes 86% currency overnight and thinks he is making a difference. It's a PR scam designed to fool the economically illiterate plebs. Long-term economic growth is only sustained by structural reforms. GST is good news in that regard, but we need *much, much* more. And so far, aside from GST, there has been little in that way.

[Or is it?](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation)

&gt; Modern capitalism depends on continuous growth and having poorer countries available to exploit for resources and cheap labor.

You mean [""providing alternative to prostitution and stealing that would otherwise be needed to sustain themselves, should they not work in the sweatshop""](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/international/sweatshops-make-poor-people-better-off)? Of the two, I'd definitely prefer sweatshop and expect conditions to improve with time (and wealth creation) as it happened in the Western World.


&gt; Tempering concentration of wealth.

Which mostly means prevent lobbying for corporate priviledges. And such lobbying actually *destroys* capitalism, going against equality before the law for all entities involved.

&gt; On paper, wealth isn't a zero-sum game, but the reality we face in the US has become wealth increasingly concentrated in the top quintile; this is pushing many of the middle levels downward, not lifting them

You're not understanding the terms.

Wealth not being zero-sum game means that gain for one party isn't necessarily accompanied by the same loss by other party. As such, richer getting rich doesn't mean poor get poorer to balance things out. Rich may get richer faster than poor are lifted out of poverty, but poor are actually continuously lifted out of it at the same time, as [statistics show for the whole World](https://fee.org/articles/5-charts-that-will-shift-your-perspective-on-poverty/).


&gt; espect for working class people. Advocating for no minimum wage, benefits, or rights for working class people destroys your own economy from the bottom up

Actually, minimum wage was originally proposed by [*eugenics* movement as means of *social exclusion*](https://mises.org/blog/minimum-wage-and-progressive-eugenics-again), especially against black minorities: 

Raising minimum wage above equilibrium has one of several unwelcome side effects:

1)Inflation - as business increases price to compensate for extra labor cost

2)Reduction in employment - as prevention of incurring extra labor cost to keep prices constant.

3)Mix of above.

&gt; Disincentivize moving production to cheaper labor markets.

And expect higher market prices as inevitable result. Brilliant!

In general, you seem to want to have consistently reduced birth rates while also expanding welfare state. Good luck with that. With demographics going to hell, you also reduce workforce, and in turn tax revenue, while at the same time increasing amount of beneficiaries of welfare state. You call that sustainable?

t1_dfpwmqv,t5_2uvnw,"Quick answer: the Republicans (undeniably the dominant party atm) has no motive to damage their hold. Pushing a narrative that Russia impacted the 2016 democratic process would do that. The intelligence agencies, overseen by ODNI, overwhelming agree there was Russian involvement, and GCHQ is reporting the same influence there, as are the governments of France, Sweden and Finland. It is to Russia's benefit to politically weaken the EU, NATO and the US. It is not politically positive for the respective opposition parties in EACH of those nations to do the same, nor believable that these opposition parties are collaborating both together AND with their respective intelligence communities. 

Did the Bush government influence the pre-ODNI CIA to generate analysis (not the raw intel itself) to support a political agenda? Yes, but it had the political dominance at the time, the CIA officially resisted (which exposed it), and that analysis was not collaborated by the other relevant agencies nor by the non-existent ODNI. 

Could all these nations' politically weaker opposition parties potentially collaborate amongst themselves to influence their respective intelligence agencies at the same time in order to make it appear that a foreign nation (Russia) was engaged in financially cheap cyber-attempts to influence the voters' perceptions of their respective candidates/major decisions in order to bolster the American Democratic party's claims the statistically unlikely President was elected by a fluke of the electoral process? Yes, the chance of this is non-zero. But to hang it on a canard of a politically mis-analyzed presentation to the UN 15 years earlier is not the best argument. Additionally, Occam's razor suggests that cyber influence of social media by Russia is internationally beneficial to President Putin and Russia, and the far most likely answer...especially since nations, organizations and individuals successfully attempt to do so since the dawn of advertising.

I was just listing what world-class quality we do have. Besides, I'm not claiming we should be challenging for the PL based purely on the quality of our squad. As I said, I believe we have the 4th best squad in the PL. Good coaching takes what we do have and makes it better than the sum of its parts. Currently, we are less than the sum of our parts. 

I am in no way overrating our team. Aside from the world-class players I mentioned, we have two shite CBs, one average CB having a decent season and a promising CB, a good (but overrated) RB, no LBs worth talking about (apart from one that never plays, though he hasn't shown anything remotely decent recently anyway. Blind is a good player, but slow and weak), our only proper DM is 35 and not that great anymore, only one decent CM who offers little going forward (Herrera), a good 10 in Mata but he's nowhere near the top playmakers in the league, nevermind Europe, a very talented wide forward who's struggling in Jose's system, a useful squad player in Lingard, Rashford who is also struggling in Mourinho's system, and Rooney who offers very little nowadays, then a load of wank like Young, Fellaini, etc.

&gt;Pogba doesn't decide games on his own nor Zlatan

This isn't true though. Zlatan literally decided the cup final on his own, amongst many other games throughout his career. When we're playing shit there's always the chance Zlatan will pull a goal out of his arse. Pogba can change a game with an amazing pass out of nowhere that leads to a goal, or a ridiculous goal out of nothing. Mkhi can create something out of nothing too. So can Martial.

&gt;hell Monaco are having ""real"" talents who are leading the team to QF of champions league

Monaco are a well-coached team implementing a tactical system that suits their players. We aren't.

You are seriously understating the effect of the coach and putting it all on the players. The blame should be shared, but the evidence suggests that Mourinho is mostly at fault. He simply can't coach attacking football and is causing our attacking players to under-perform. Players don't regress this much because they're overrated.

t1_dfpqw9v,t5_2qh16,"&gt;Why was there a server in Trump tower connected to a Russian bank well known for money laundering?

There wasn't. The server was in a Listrak datacenter in Philly. Trump's business was the registrant of the server not admin. Cendyn, a hotel marketing company, was/is the admin. This has been repeatedly debunked.

&gt;Why did so many of Trump's people meet with a Russian Spymaster?

Wasn't it only Kushner that did? The others met with the Russian Ambassador.

&gt;Why did do many then lie about it if it were no big deal?

At the very least, because that's typical in politics. Obviously maybe a lot more.  

&gt;If there is nothing, why is Flynn asking for immunity?

Why speak with a lawyer if accused of a crime? Asking for immunity=/ sign of guilt. 

&gt;Care to name any Democrats asking for immunity?

Clinton's aides. 

&gt;If there is nothing to find, why try to sabotage the hearings, why fight so hard not to have them if there is nothing there? Worried what 8 or so hearing might find? Worried to face the same sort of inquiry the RNC has been happy to throw around?

Do you think Clinton/dems benefited from all those hearings on Benghazi? Do you think GOP incumbents will be rewarded for these hearings even if it turns out Trump is 100% exonerated? (he wouldn't be)

&gt;Ok, so why was the ONLY thing Trump's team changed on the GOP platform was to help Russia?

Why did Obama repeatedly go against the recommendations of the pentagon and state department by refusing to arm Ukraine? Why has Merkel repeatedly advised against weapon shipments and harsher sanctions? Why for maybe the first time ever are Chomsky and Kissinger in agreement that arming Ukraine is a bad idea and fault the Russian invasion of Ukraine on U.S. provocation? 

What does Russia even gain compared to the numerous downsides from conspiring *directly* with Trump's team *before* the election?  

Maybe it's not a great idea to breathe life into every crazy Russian conspiracy theory at the expense of coverage for all the other horrible shit this admin has been doing which isn't in dispute? Trump cutting funding for everything that isn't the military? Let's focus on this newest piece in the Russia story. War crimes in Syria?  This benefits Putin by creating a refugee crisis in Europe.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

t3_62ujzv,t5_2qhqb,"Undoubtably, metrication should be re-started and completed.

Metrication is inevitable, and eventually it will be completed. It's not situation of ""if"" but rather a situation of ""when"". It will probably take a generation or two' maybe 50 to 80 years. 

History records that the metric system has been gradually adopted by all of the world’s people. Despite often-vigorous opposition, the metric system has always been successful. There are no countries that don't have metric units. 

Metrication is a change that continues to happen. It has slowed almost stalled but it hasn't stopped. Few would disagree that the UK of today is more metric than the UK of 10 or 20 years ago, and the UK in 20 years from now will be more metric than what we have today. 

As with most things, there are costs. and it costs to change to metric. But what is often not discussed, and overlooked, is the costs of not changing to metric. It's fairly obvious and was stated as long ago as the Magna Carta, that one system of measurement, measurement unity, is better, better understood, less confusing, and generally more efficient, than two systems of measurement that overlap and measure the same properties. There are significant benefits and gains throughout the community, society, business, commerce, and government, by having measurement unity. Metrication should be seen as an investment to improve better understanding of all measurement, not just the units that overlap with Imperial units.


Those that support a return, either partial or complete, to pounds and ounces for selling and buying, and other trading, use the word ""freedom"" or rather ""freedom of choice"" by allowing the seller or buyer to ""be free"" to choose to use pounds and ounces or kilograms or grams. This is actually the freedom to confuse, deceive, cheat, rip off, and to weaken the laws regarding ""fair trading"" by having two types of measuring systems, and that leads to corruption, something that is mostly avoided by having one clearly understood system of measurement.

Returning to Imperial units is clearly a backward step.

IMO Brexit will ultimately accelerate metrication, not hinder it. Exiting the EU won't remove metric units. It will place the UK on the stage of global trade and communication, in which the global language of measurement is the metric system and its measures. International trade, is almost totally metric units, even to the US and that can't be ignored by those that are ant-metric.

And they have a point. If you take something like the contribution to the EU budget and divide up things like pension liabilities then the UK and Germany are left with the lion's share of the bill. Is it fair that they would have to cover the outstanding bill by the most of any country when they are the ones that are paying the most and keeping it down already?

1. Business tycoon. Requires money, lots of it, Requires true talent and knowledge.

2. Politician. Must be highly educated and have the connections to rise in the steps of power. Also requires money, lots of it.

3. Military leader. Requires true courage and a major war or series of wars in which you can prove your valor... also you must be prepared to die in said wars as you rise through the lower ranks.

4. Religious leader in an established faith. Again requires a lifelong slow climb through the ranks has little personal glory until the higher ranks.

5. Religious leader in a new religion. By far the easiest path, needs no formal education, needs no money to start. You can set yourself as the top authority from the start rather than work your easy up. You can also set the rules as you go. All you need is a few followers, who you task with finding other followers and so on... a perfect pyramid scheme.

Basically it was the easiest way to gain power and prestige given his starting circumstances. All he needed was a few devoted followers in the early days who he would compensate by raising them to positions of authority too. Then a charismatic way of presenting their 'product'. This was the gap in the market... All the other religious groups (Christian sects) where foreign religions. Stories set in the Middle East interpreted by Europeans and shipped over to the new world with immigrants. What Joseph gave them was a home-grown United States religion that had roots in Christianity but could break free from the dependence of European heritage. They now had their own American book of scripture.

To those hearing about this new scripture it was a patriotic boost that America was not reliant on the old world for issues of faith but could now stand alone, with 'proof' that Jesus had visited and cared about the people who lived right here in America!

Basically my opinion is that Joseph saw a gap in the market and exploited it in order to gain a foothold to power. It's worth noting that he used this position of power and influence in order to attempt to side step into other routes of power as a military general in the Nauvoo and eventually running for the position of President of the USA.

I have to say I don't know much about humanities, the competition seems to be a real thing though. Still, those people advicing not to do the bifurication might not really know about how one lives with that procedure.
You also wondered about IT as a more allowing field. Nature sciences are for many parts more allowing and more performance oriented. I also know large amount of trans people working in IT, so it is accepting in that field also.

I have large gauge septum, where I usually just wear plug so hardly none knows, and I also have huge conches, that I hardly keep anything too dangly (not for restrains, but just because of my personal likings). I'm also having subtle high nostrils and are on my way for large philtrum. No lobes, waa. I'm also tattooed, but mostly below my clothes. Wrists may show some though.
At first I tried to wait for the moment where I'd hold a unique skills that none could just dismiss beyond my body, but let's be real - that is not going to happen. I've always received relatively ok (mostly noninterested in a good way) feedback on my appearance, and this has strengthen the idea that my work is the most important thing. Yes, I'm only a masters student (nature sciences) and I've been assured that my personal tastes wouldn't become in a way on a PhD selection process or anything. If after that it happens that some timid a**hat insists me not to get some position I've applied for, be it that I'll end up as normal scientist where I still can contribute to the society from the bottom of all of knowledge gained.

Still, as I now reside in Europe it is easy to travel between countries/academias and be accepted, and I understand that it might be totally different thing if I was to move to some place holding more traditional values. So a lot of course is in my own hands, but I don't see too much or too harsh limitations.

The main issue we face with the mix right now is just that we mix and match things to a point where it's hard for people to translate.

I know how much I weight in stones and pounds, but not in kg. Yet when measuring objects I use kg or grams. I just lose the ability to simply compare.

Same with my height being in feet and inches, but measuring almost all distances in cm.

But where it gets really annoying is things like mpg. Miles per gallon is so useless as an actual number for people to use. We buy petrol by the litre, not the gallon! So if I fill up my car I can't easily tell you its approximate range despite knowing it's mpg.

It's not a major issue, and it's one that new children are less likely to face as they seem to be growing up using just metric (except for the whole miles thing).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/095fb47c23f44418a251e8b0d7fd8c49.png)  

&gt; Yngwie Johann Malmsteen (born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck, June 30, 1963) is a virtuoso guitarist / neo-classical metal artist from Sweden who achieved widespread acclaim in the 1980s for his technical proficiency and fusion of classical music elements with heavy rock guitar.

&gt; Born into a musical family in Stockholm, Yngwie was the youngest child in the family. At an early age, he showed little interest in music. It wasn't until September 18, 1970 when at age seven he saw a TV special on the death of Jimi Hendrix that Malmsteen became obsessed with the guitar. To quote his official website, ""The day Jimi Hendrix died, the guitar-playing Yngwie was born"".

&gt; Malmsteen was in his teens when he first encountered the music of the 19th-century violin virtuoso Niccolo Paganini, whom he cites as his biggest classical influence. It has been rumoured that Yngwie believes himself to be the reincarnation of the temperamental, often criticized, and widely misunderstood violinist from Genoa. Through his emulation of Paganini concerto pieces on guitar, Malmsteen developed a prodigious technical fluency. Malmsteen also cites Jimi Hendrix, Genesis, Uli Jon Roth, and Deep Purple as influences.

&gt; Malmsteen's contributions to the evolution of modern rock guitar, particularly his embracing of modal progressions and classically-influenced techniques not widely used in rock music, broke new ground and Malmsteen is often credited with the creation of the neoclassical metal genre, inspiring a new generation of virtuoso electric guitarists including Paul Gilbert and Tony MacAlpine.

&gt; 1980s

&gt; In late 1982 Malmsteen was brought to the USA by Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records, who had heard a demo tape of Malmsteen's playing. Shrapnel is synonymous with the shred style of music. He had brief engagements with Steeler, for their self-titled album of 1983, then Alcatrazz, for their 1983 debut No Parole From Rock N' Roll, and the 1984 live album Live Sentence. He left Alcatrazz in 1984, replaced by Steve Vai, and began his solo career.

&gt; Malmsteen released his first solo album ""Rising Force"" (winner of Guitar Player Magazine's Best Rock Album and nominated for a 1984 Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental) which achieved #60 on the Billboard album chart. He was nominated for a Grammy and later Rising Force topped the charts at number 1. This was followed by ""Marching Out"" (1985). Jeff Scott Soto was the singer on the first two albums.

&gt; His third album, Trilogy, was released in 1986. In 1987, former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner joined his band. That year, Malmsteen was in a serious car accident, smashing his Jaguar XKE into a tree and putting him in a coma for a week. Nerve damage to his right hand was reported. It was during his time in the hospital that Malmsteen's mother died from cancer.

&gt; In the summer of 1988 he released his fourth album, Odyssey. Odyssey would be his biggest hit album, mainly because of its first single ""Heaven Tonight"". Shows in Russia during the Odyssey tour were recorded, and released in 1989 as his fifth album Trial By Fire: Live in Leningrad. The concert in Leningrad was the largest ever by a western artist in the Soviet Union, and Malmsteen's record sales in Russia totalled 27 million.

&gt; In late 1988, his signature series Fender Stratocaster was released, making him the second artist so honored, after Eric Clapton.

&gt; Malmsteen's style ""Neo-classical"" became somewhat popular during the mid 1980s, with notable contemporaries such as Paul Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Tony MacAlpine and Vinnie Moore all reaching prominence after Yngwie. However, only Paul Gilbert claimed Yngwie as an influence, with MacAlpine coming to the neoclassical/shred field by applying his classical piano training to his guitar playing and Moore arriving at a similar style because he shared Yngwie's major influences, Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple and Al Di Meola, American jazz fusion great of Return to Forever fame.

&gt; 1990s

&gt; In the early 1990s he released the albums Eclipse (1990), The Yngwie Malmsteen Collection (1991), Fire and Ice (1992) and The Seventh Sign (1994).

&gt; Despite his early success, and continuous success in Europe and Asia, by the early 1990s the gratuitous over-the-top stylings of 1980s heavy metal had become unfashionable in the USA. This was displaced by the Seattle grunge movement, where technical ability was replaced by simpler, more emotionally-driven songs. The grunge rock movement may have arisen in part as a backlash to the overly technical metal inspired by Malmsteen and his contemporaries, which despite its often impressive technique was regarded by many as ponderous, bland and self-indulgent.

&gt; In the 1990s, Malmsteen continued to record and release albums under the Japanese record label Pony Canyon, and maintained a devoted following in Europe and Japan, and to a lesser extent in the USA. In 2000, he once again acquired a contract with a US record label, Spitfire, and released his 1990s catalog into the US market for the first time, including what he regards as his masterpiece Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra, recorded with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in Prague.

&gt; 2000s

&gt; After the release of War to End All Wars in 2000, singer Mark Boals left the band. Yngwie went on tour with former Ark vocalist Jorn Lande. Due to various tensions on tour, Jorn left before the recording of Yngwie's next album, Attack!!. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Doogie White. White's vocals were well received by fans, and it seems that he has become a permanent member of the band.

&gt; In 2003, Malmsteen joined Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, with whom he toured as part of the G3 supergroup.

&gt; Yngwie released Unleash the Fury in 2005. 'As stated in an issue of ""Guitar World"" magazine, he titled this album after the infamous 'airline incident', which occurred on a flight to Japan for the 'Odyssey' tour. He was drunk and was behaving obnoxiously, until he fell asleep and was roused by a woman dumping water on him. Enraged, he shouted, ""You stupid bitch! You've unleashed the fockin fury!"" The audio from this moment was caught on tape by a fellow band member.

&gt; He is married to April and has a son named Antonio after Antonio Vivaldi. A noted Ferrari enthusiast, he owns a black 1985 308 GTS[1] and a red 1962 250 GTO.[2] In recent years, Yngwie has given up both smoking and drinking. The Malmsteen family lives in Miami.

&gt; Specialized guitar

&gt; Aside from technical prowess, distinctions of Malmsteen's guitar style include a wide, violin-like vibrato inspired by classical violinists, and use of such minor scales as the Harmonic minor, and minor modes such as Phrygian, and Aeolian. Malmsteen cites the Fender Stratocaster and the single coil pickups (of which he uses his custom design by DiMarzio, which are actually a vertically-stacked humbucker mounted in a single coil housing Malmsteen sought to combine the tone of a single coil with the reduced noise of a humbucker) as being instrumental to his unique tone. The Malmsteen signature model Stratocaster made by Fender is based accurately upon this combination.

&gt; The guitars he uses are recognizable by the addition of a custom scalloped fretboard. This is similar to a regular fretboard, but with wood 'scalloped' or scooped away to form a concave shape in between the frets. Malmsteen allegedly conceived this design as a teenager while working in a music store in Stockholm, Sweden when he came across a 17th century lute with a scalloped neck using the raised wood as frets. However, this can also be viewed as an influence from Ritchie Blackmore, one of his most readily admitted idols, who also favors scalloped neck Fender Stratocasters. Malmsteen himself has said he learned most from Ritchie Blackmore's guitar riffs and solos as a beginning guitarist. Also, jazz-fusion guitarist John McLaughlin used scalloped fingerboards long before Malmsteen came on the scene.

&gt; Even for the experienced guitar player, the scalloped fingerboard proves very difficult to perform on, as there is no surface contact between finger and wood to aid in the feel of the vibrato motion. The strings of the guitar, when fretted, are easily pushed sharp and out of tune. The highly accurate, delicate yet controlled touch required to play properly with Malmsteen's modified Stratocaster is elusive for most, and an integral part of Malmsteen's technique.

I'm on EU low diamond and maybe there just aren't any wallhuggers here but it seems far more common that i meet people who try to zone me to prevent me from recovering on to the stage just by standing on the platform and spamming sair/nlight/dlight depeding on the weapon.

A couple examples: 
&gt; 
&gt; “The one that really blew my mind was the nasal spray,” said Robin Levi, Hannah and Abby’s mother, referring to her $80 co-payment for Rhinocort Aqua, a prescription drug that was selling for more than $250 a month in Oakland pharmacies last year but costs under $7 in Europe, where it is available **over the counter**.

and...

&gt; The arsenal of medicines in the Hayeses’ kitchen helps explain why. Pulmicort, a steroid inhaler, generally retails for over $175 in the United States, while pharmacists in Britain buy the identical product for about $20 and dispense it free of charge to asthma patients. Albuterol, one of the oldest asthma medicines, typically costs $50 to $100 per inhaler in the United States, but it was less than $15 a decade ago, before it was repatented. 

Lifted from one article in the NYT. Perfectly highlights the truth. Patents, re-patenting, and good old fashion holding-patients-hostage, are to blame. 

Albuterol (AKA Salbutamol) is *old* and is available as a generic medicine. The wholesale cost of one 200 dose Salbutamol reliever inhaler is between $1-$3 in some parts of the world. That should last months. If it doesn't last months it means the asthma is not under control and the patient most likely also requires a steroid inhaler, which costs similarly to the reliever inhaler. 

Medicine is cheap to make. It costs a lot to develop, but not as much as you might think. After all, R&amp;D is taken into account when working out profit, and the profit margins of pharma companies are *literally* obscene.

With the money they spend on lobbying it's unlikely things will change for patients in the US any time soon. ",3,perilousrob,funny,False,0,True,,t3_62y6v2,False,dfq62dr,1491138747,,,0,1493726808,

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e667d67becc24254871a29b948ba7fb8.png)  

&gt; Umphrey's McGee is a progressive rock / jam band from South Bend, IN now based in Chicago, IL.

&gt; They are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.

&gt; Formed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands. 

&gt; In mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All in Time.

&gt; Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs for Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.

&gt; The addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.

&gt; Around 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the ""Jimmy Stewart Ballroom"" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions ""Jimmy Stewart."" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by ""McL"" in the ""Jimmy Stewart writeup"" on the fan message board known as ""The Bort"" at www.umphreaks.com.

&gt; 2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.

&gt; In October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.  

&gt; In 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to ""have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes."" 

&gt; In April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  

&gt; A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised ""Jimmy Stewart"" sessions recorded in 2007.

&gt; Umphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez’s I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they’d composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band’s longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material. 

&gt; Mantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the ""perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign"" by Reuters.com.

&gt; Mantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album marked Umphrey’s second decade together as a band and was the first Umphrey’s album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road. Read more on Last.fm.

This is was the women who in the 90s, took *decades* worth of hard, thankless work from the careers of thousands of economists, health care workers, and congressional democrats and their staff to build up a consensus on universal health care (which probably will never happen again in our lifetimes) that was finally strong enough for legitimate reform to get through and *pissed it all away in a few months* leaving us with the healthcare system that, by '08, was acknowledged by both parties as being catastrophic with crisis levels of uninsured citizens and skyrocketing prices and premiums. She took this on despite no qualification to pass major reform on something as crucial as healthcare through Congress and lasted a matter of weeks before she buckled and began taking huge sums of money from the same HMO lobbying groups that *would ultimately defeat the bill*, continuing this trend by being the highest recipient of HMO money in the entire US congress. Not highest recipient of all democrats, of ALL congress, including republicans. Oh and also, this Healthcare Task Force of Hillary's was so important to her that she urged, and this is completely fucking true, urged Bill, who really wanted to go, to delay bombing Serbia to stop the butchery and *ethnic cleansing* because it would take attention away from her healthcare task force:

&gt;Taking the advice of Al Gore and National Security Advisor Tony Lake, Bill agreed to a proposal to bomb Serbian military positions while helping the Muslims acquire weapons to defend themselves—the fulfillment of a pledge he had made during the 1992 campaign. But instead of pushing European leaders, he directed Secretary of State Warren Christopher merely to consult with them. When they balked at the plan, Bill quickly retreated, creating a ""perception of drift."" The key factor in Bill's policy reversal was Hillary, who was said to have ""deep misgivings"" and viewed the situation as ""a Vietnam that would compromise health-care reform."" The United States took no further action in Bosnia, and the ""ethnic cleansing"" by the Serbs was to continue for four more years, resulting in the deaths of more than 250,000 people.

What actually happened was George Bush and his posse of dastardly pals decided one day that they wanted their own country with blackjack and hookers. So they went around to all their consenting workers, and owners of consenting workers (probably not the consenting workers though, the facts are a bit sketchy here) and decided to write a petition. They called it the Declaration of Independence, and once everyone signed it they shipped it off to Europe.

Reading this well thought out petition penned by Tommy ""the Dumbwaiter"" Jefferson, St George the Belligerent in his divine grace decided to allow these good property owners to create their own kingdom, later to become the United Kingdoms of America. So impressed with the petition, Ol' Georgy boy sent a gift to America to let them celebrate their new independence with 'one of the most raddest of raves this side of the Mississippi' (Jefferson et al., 1776).

All this stuff about domestic terrorism in Boston at the time is absolute boulderdash! What actually happened was that the tea, sent as a gift to Thomas ""My name is"" Jeff(erson), was meant for a literal tea party - as was the custom in the 18th century. The dock workers down in Boston actually misheard the orders given to them by their foreman. They were told to ""give Jefferson this tea"". But what they heard was ""jettison [the tea] into the sea"". The rest, as they say, is liberal history.

I so wish that we can be just like our forefathers and have the spine to collectively (dangerous choice of word, I know) pen a well written petition to Overlord Don Cheeto. I know with my bleeding liberal heart that he would heed it. We just need to trust him.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

 **comment content**: **Nina Hagen**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/8620cc7793244592aae6d8828c1dd27c.png)  

&gt; Catharina ""Nina"" Hagen (born on March 11, 1955) is a singer from former East Berlin, German Democratic Republic; now Berlin, Germany. Her musical career began when she left school at age sixteen, and went to Poland in 1971. After that, she returned to Germany and joined the cover band Fritzens Dampferband (Fritz's Steamboat Band), together with Achim Mentzel and others. She added songs by Janis Joplin and Tina Turner to the ""allowable"" set lists during shows.
From 1972 to 1973, Hagen enrolled in the crash-course performance program at The Central Studio for Light Music in East Berlin. Upon graduation, she joined the band Automobil (picture), which released a well-received album in Germany, including her first hit ""Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen"" in 1974.

&gt; After a concert for a West German labour union in 1976 her stepfather, Wolf Biermann, was forbidden to return to the GDR. Because of their protests against it her mother, Eva-Maria Hagen and Nina were thrown out of GDR in 1977, and followed Biermann to his hometown Hamburg.

&gt; Nina subsequently met West-Berlin photographer Jim Rakete (who also produced some bands he shot the cover-photos for - like ""Nena"" some years later). He brought Nina together with the politically left-wing band ""Lokomotive Kreuzberg"" (later known as ""Spliff""): thus the ""Nina Hagen Band"" was born.

&gt; In 1978 The Nina Hagen Band released their self-titled debut album, which included titles like ""TV-Glotzer"" (a cover of ""White Punks on Dope"" by The Tubes) and ""Auf'm Bahnhof Zoo"".

&gt; According to reviewer Fritz Rumler, she thrusts herself into the music, aggressively, directly, furiously, roars in the most beautiful operatic alto, then, through shrieks and squeals, precipitates herself into luminous soprano heights... she parodies, satirises, and howls on stage like a dervish. 

&gt; Nina Hagen's eccentricity led to big disputes in the band and during a subsequent European tour Hagen decided to leave the band, though she was still under contract to produce a second album in 1979. This LP, Unbehagen (in addition to the obvious pun on her name, in German this also means 'discomfort' or 'unease'), was eventually produced with the band recording their tracks in Berlin and Hagen recording the vocals in Los Angeles, California. It included the single ""African Reggae""/""Wir leben immer... noch"" (a cover of Lene Lovich's ""Lucky Number""). The headless Nina Hagen Band soon developed a successful independent musical career as Spliff.

&gt; Meanwhile, Hagen's public persona was steadily creating an increasing media uproar and she became infamous for an appearance on an Austrian talk show called Club 2, in which she performed an explicit simulation of masturbation. She also acted with Dutch sex-drugs-and-rock-'n'-roll legend Herman Brood in the movie Cha Cha, along with Lene Lovich and various Dutch bands.

&gt; An European tour with a new band in 1980 was cancelled, she had a love affair with a 16 year old punk from Amsterdam called Noddy (www.noddyriot.co.uk) and sang a RHCP rapduet with him at the OneWorldPoetry festival at the MilkyWay and lived with him in New York and in the Bahamas.

&gt; In 1982 her first solo album NunSexMonkRock, a dissonant mix of punk, funk and opera, was a minor hit, and led to a world tour with the No Problem Orchestra.

&gt; In 1983 came the album Angstlos and a minor European tour. By this time, Hagen's public appearances were becoming even stranger; over the years they frequently included discussions of God, UFOs, her social and political beliefs, animal rights / vivisection and claims of alien sightings. The English version of Angstlos, 'Fearless', generated two major club hits in America , ""Zarah"" and the disco/punk/opera classic, ""New York New York"".

&gt; 1985's 'Nina Hagen In Ekstasy' fared less well, but it did generate club hits with ""Universal Radio"" and a cover of ""Spirit In The Sky"", and it also featured her hardcore punk take on Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"", which had been one of her signature live tunes in previous years. Her contract with CBS over, she released the Punk Wedding EP independently in 1987, a celebration of her marriage to an 18-year old punk. It followed an independent 1986 one-off single with Lene Lovich, the anthemic ""Don't Kill The Animals"".

&gt; In 1989 Hagen released the album Nina Hagen which was backed up by another German tour. Now living in Paris with her daughter Cosma Shiva, in 1991 she toured Europe in support of her new album Street.

&gt; In 1992 Hagen became the host of a TV show on RTLplus. The following year she released Revolution Ballroom and two years later the German-language album Freud Euch appeared, recorded in English as Beehappy in 1996. Also in 1996, Hagen collaborated with electronic music composer Christopher Franke on ""Alchemy of Love"", the theme song for the Tenchi Universe movie Tenchi Muyo! in Love.

&gt; In 1998, Hagen became the host of a weekly science fiction show on the British Sci-Fi-Channel, in addition to embarking on another tour of Germany. In 1999, she released the devotional album Om Namah Shivay, which was distributed exclusively online. She also sang ""Witness"" on KMFDM's Adios.

&gt; Nina has a strong interest in various religions, but that is mainly driven by her urge to build a better world and her own colorful freedom within it.

&gt; In 2000, her song Schön ist die Welt became the official song of Expo 2000. The album The Return of the Mother was released in February 2001, accompanied by another German tour.

&gt; Hagen dubbed the voice of Sally in the German release of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and she also did some voice work in Hot Dogs by Michael Schoemann.

&gt; Hagen has been featured on many songs by other bands, for instance Oomph!'s song Fieber, a cover of Rammstein's ""Seemann"" with Apocalyptica and in 2008 appeared readily on psy-trance act S.U.N. Project's X Black Album, most notably on the fully vocal track We're In Space. She also sang the song ""Garota de Berlim"" with Brazilian singer Supla in her early years.

&gt; Her two children are Cosma Shiva and Otis.

We joined the Allies a few months after the Soviets. Why would we have joined earlier when we weren't attacked?

&gt; Not only that but you were profiteering off the war from both sides, so it's utterly laughable when Americans try to play the noble hero card.

Yes, by providing the Allies with massive amounts of resources necessary to maintain their war effort and sacrificing several ships to Axis navies to transport those resources?

&gt; It could also be argued that post WW2, the US' involvement in foreign affairs has been far too excessive. The US has completely ditched the pre WW2 Isolationism ideology, and has become a real ugly war hungry nation. This is undeniable.

It's quite hard being an isolationist superpower. Furthermore, if we were truly isolationist...expect Russia and China to bully their neighbors. 

As opposed to the British Empire? Spanish? Portugese? When we became a superpower we could have decided to colonize over half the planet in the name of ""civilization"" but we didn't. Instead, we supported countries such as South Korea and South Vietnam against their communist Northern counterparts, and look where South Korea is today. We've made mistakes, like Iraq.

What is the evidence of your allegations ""JFK was a pig to women and adored Hitler"".  
    
No one said Trump is some radical isis member. You said that.  
    
Did you say that because you heard Trump speaking in the past about President Barack Obama, when Trump said, [""No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS...""](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/11/politics/donald-trump-hugh-hewitt-obama-founder-isis/). Do you think President Obama is the founder of ISIS?  
    
Trump publicly said he saw thousands of people cheering in New Jersey on 9/11. Do you think Trump saw thousands of people cheering in New Jersey on 9/11?    
    
Trump publicly said he knows more than generals. Do you think Trump knows more than generals?  
    
Trump publicly stated his picture was featured on the cover page of Time Magazine 14 or 15 times...the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine. Do you think Trump set the all-time record on the cover of Time?  
    
Hint: Time Magazine said [President Richard Nixon set the all-time record](http://time.com/3080127/nixons-time-magazine-covers/) because he was on the Time cover 55 times.  
    
Time still might help Trump break Nixon's record during the period leading up to and after Trump's impeachment or after Trump resigns, which could begin to happen before or as soon as one or more of the investigations into Trump are completed in the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI Criminal division, the FBI Counterintelligence division, and after investigators have received personal testimony from some of the dozens of witnesses they already have lined up to give testimony, including Lt. General Michael Flynn, Trump's fired National Security Advisor, whose lawyer already has filed a formal request with Congress and the FBI to grant Flynn immunity from criminal prosecution in trade for Flynn's testimony.  
    
It looks like retired British MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele might travel from London to Washington, D.C. to give his personal testimony to the FBI and Congress.    
    
Christopher Steele used the assets and contacts in his spy network in Europe and Russia to gather the intelligence to write the eye-catching 35-page dossier about Trump and Trump's alleged personal obsessions and sexual perversion activities in Russia and Trump's alleged collusion with Russia to intervene in the U.S. election.  
    
The dossier was carried to Canada where it was given to U.S. Senator John McCain, who gave the dossier to the FBI, which gave the dossier to some of the other agencies in the U.S. Intelligence Community, which gave a declassified copy of the dossier to Donald Trump himself on January 6, 2017.    
    
The outstanding investigative journalist Jason Leopold, who works for BuzzFeed, obtained a copy of the dossier.  
    
On February 10, 2017, [BuzzFeed published the dossier](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonaleopold/us-intelligence-has-confirmed-parts-of-the-dossier-about-tru?utm_term=.foG8BJpRJW#.nfYAGQ9RQL) online.  
    
Millions of people all over the United States and around the world have read the dossier.  
    
The public can read and/or download a copy of the FBI dossier about Trump, his alleged personal obsessions and sexual perversions, and his alleged collusion with the Russian government at this direct link: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html#document/p5    
    
One of most salacious sections in the dossier is on Page 2, Paragraph 3., which describes Trump's alleged personal obsessions and sexual perversion when Trump arranged for some prostitutes to come to his room in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow and give him a ""golden shower"", a urination show, in front of him. The dossier states a Russian intelligence agency allegedly recorded Trump's personal obsessions and sexual perversion with hidden microphones and cameras. The dossier describes an alleged trip Trump made to Saint Petersburg, Russia. The dossier suggests other kinky sexual things Trump allegedly did in Saint Petersburg, too.  
    
Trump's daughter, Ivanka, his wife, Melania, and other people in the family might have read the dossier.  
    
If they read it, I wonder what Ivanka and Melania think of Trump's alleged personal obsessions, sexual perversions, and golden showers with prostitutes.    
    
Maybe daughter Ivanka likes the information in the dossier because the idea of her dad having personal obsessions, sexual perversions, and golden showers with a group of prostitutes makes her feel sexy. Maybe that's why Ivanka nearly always is smiling when she is around her dad, wearing a sexy tight dress and giving him kisses.  
    
Maybe wife Melania likes the information in the dossier because the idea of her husband having alleged personal obsessions, sexual perversions, and golden showers with a group of prostitutes is very sexy. Maybe that's why she nearly always is smiling.  
    
It's a good thing American liberal democracy has liberal institutions like the constitutional guarantees of free speech and a free press.  
    
All of the ongoing investigations, the truth, free speech, the free press, impeachment, or resignation will make America great again by getting rid of Trump.

The timer basically forced people into organizing around drawing anything more than a random mosaic. Subreddits have formed, there is diplomacy, strategy, and rivalry among organized groups all fighting to create art or expand across the canvas, each group battling each other as well as the writhing chaos of the uncoordinated hivemind placing random pixels and trying to destroy or otherwise convert everything into a swastika. As a result, memes, jokes, and hilarity has been born. 

One particularly fun example: the Germans and French painted their respective flags, and then in historical German fashion, Germany began to expand unilaterally, consuming territory towards France. Germany nearly subsumed France until it escaped north. It was a furious fight on who would overlap who, until peace was reached--the intersection became the European Union flag. 

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/B6s1lDLzx-8). The Germany/France event happened lower left, about halfway through.

Le Pen has skillfully managed to pass off as ""tolerant"" ( a bad word, because toleration is not acceptance nor equality) while having written in black and white in her program the repeal of the Toubira law ( the law that brought marriage equality in France) and its replacement with a powered up version of the PACS ( French civil partnership).

Rich states in the USA send money to poor states all the time. They have for decades without complaining. Rich states such as California and New York send lots of money to states like Mississippi and Alabama every year without any fuss, without expecting any of that money back, and they've been doing it for decades every single year.

Germany had to be dragged kicking and screaming to bail out Greece and Germany demanded severe concessions from Greece, greatly harming the economy and people of Greece. And that was just for one bailout. Europe was barely able to do even one time what states in the USA do every single year without complaint.

There's not a lot of European unity. Its still individual nations looking out primarily for their own interests even if that means having to screw over one of their neighbors. Not only would a theoretical United States of Europe need to have the people of Europe think of themselves primarily as European instead of primarily German, French, Italian, etc, but these nations would need to willingly cede tremendous power, including giving up their military.

As what u/ThreeTimesUp said elsewhere in this thread; *""You can only be said to 'own' that which you can, and are willing to, defend - and that includes everything all the way down to your toothbrush.""* A nation giving up its ability to defend anything and turning into a state in a federal system is a tremendous leap of faith, one that a nation has almost never made throughout nearly all of history. The only two times I can recall this happening in all of history peacefully, and without war among nations willing to give up their sovereignty, was when the American colonies (effectively independent nations at the time) gave up their sovereignty to be a part of a federal government. Even then that was tested in the extreme in the 1860's. The other case where nation-states willingly gave up sovereignty was when Germany confederated into a single country.

My point is essentially one of principle. It doesn't require any assumptions regarding why Leave voters voted one way and Remainers another. It simply reflects the following:

1) I want to live in a country that treats people in an equitable fashion when they attempt to enter it.

2) Treating non-UK citizen differently on the basis of their nationality is something I can no longer abide.

It is often stated that the UK could have limited EU FOM, what is never stated is that the UK would be required to deem EU immigrants a threat in order to do so. Successive UK government have not felt that this approach was feasible.

There are currently only 2 ways to achieve this:

1) An open border policy

2) Leaving the EU and applying an equitable immigration system for all non-UK citizens

2. Lisbon is **not** the EU Constitution. Parts of it were salvaged, but this has happened with every new foundational treaty. In particular, there is a long line of documents, from Rome over Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon which affirmed and reaffirmed member states' commitment and their wish to organise themselves into the EU. Can anyone comment on whether or not Lisbon went through referenda in France/Netherlands? What was changed to appease the Irish? In any case, renegotiation and a revote on a **changed** document should not be controversial, in particular if problematic issues were addressed and resolved.

t3_62yvmb,t5_2ssp3,"There are two misconceptions in this question. Firstly, the RAF did use both the B-17 and B-24. However, they only used the former in the strategic bombing role, and that only for a few raids. The RAF operated the B-17C as the Fortress I, receiving 20 aircraft in the spring of 1941. These aircraft took part in several daylight raids, mainly against German-held ports, but proved to be both unreliable and vulnerable to German aircraft. The remainder were transferred to Coastal Command, which direly needed any aircraft it could get. These were further augmented by a shipment of B-17E (Fortress II) and B-17F (Fortress III) aircraft in August 1942. The B-24, meanwhile, operated as the Liberator I. They were mostly used by Coastal Command, where their great range was vital in closing the mid-Atlantic air gap. However, they were also used by Bomber Command in subsidiary theatres, primarily Burma. Secondly, while night-bombing accuracy was poor in the early war, it improved greatly with time. Improvements in tactics and technology allowed for major increases in accuracy. The formation of the Pathfinder Force (PFF) in August 1942 was key to the improvement in accuracy. This force was to proceed night attacks, dropping markers accurately to give the bomber force targets to hit. The Pathfinder Force was aided by the introduction of radio-navigation aids. These systems, codenamed Oboe, Gee and Gee-H, allowed pathfinder aircraft to be guided accurately to its target by ground stations. The introduction of the H2S navigational radar also allowed aircraft to locate targets precisely at night or in overcast weather. A further improvement to tactics came with the setting up of the 'Master Bomber' system, whereby raids were commanded by an officer in one of the bombers, directing the efforts of the PFF and follow-up aircraft. The introduction of the DeHavilland Mosquito light bomber also aided the PFF, as it could accurately place target markers, or conduct diversionary raids to split the German defences. By the end of the war, accuracy for night bombing was over 90%.

To answer your question, there are two main reasons why Bomber Command didn't use American bombers in Europe. The first is down to the differing philosophies held by Bomber Command leadership and USAAC leadership. The USAAC believed in precision bombing. In this, bombers were to target factories (or similar strategic targets) directly, knocking out targets without damaging the surrounding city. This imposed certain limitations on operations, and hence on the aircraft needed to carry them out. To achieve the required accuracy, the aircraft had to fly in daylight. This meant that they would be exposed to the full force of the German defences, and hence had to carry their own heavy defences. This cut into useful payload - however, this was a worthwhile tradeoff, as what bombs were carried would have a greater effect on the target through the increased precision. USAAC bombers also had no need to carry large bombs, so their bomb bays were short but deep. In comparison, RAF's Bomber Command, under Arthur Harris, believed in area bombing. Area bombing didn't target the factories so much as the cities that contained them. It is difficult to destroy factory equipment with bombs. Instead, Harris believed that it would be more effective to prevent a factory working by destroying the housing used by its workers, forcing them to evacuate the city. Area bombing could be done effectively at night, reducing the risk to the aircraft. This meant that the aircraft used could carry fewer defences, and hence a higher payload. The bombers carried loadouts that were more suitable for destroying large built-up areas. This included large 'high capacity' bombs, such as the 4000lb HC, nicknamed a 'blockbuster' for its ability to destroy city blocks, and large amounts of incendiary bombs. To carry and deploy these effectively, RAF aircraft had long, shallow bomb bays. Over the course of the war, precision bombing proved to be only somewhat effective. While it had proven effective in pre-war exercises, these were under favourable conditions with well-trained crews. When confronted with heavy defences, with poor weather and inexperienced wartime crews, it proved to be somewhat less accurate. However, it was still useful against point targets, such as oil refineries or railway junctions. Area bombing was effective at destroying homes and factories, but much less useful against these targets. This fundamental difference in philosophy had a great effect on aircraft design, with aircraft suitable for one unsuitable for use in the other. 

The other consideration was more about the effective use of limited runway space and air routes. Committing Bomber Command to the use of American aircraft would mean committing to daylight raids as well, as these were what the USAAC aircraft were optimised for. This would greatly complicate airspace management over the UK and Germany, as both the USAAC and RAF would be operating raids in the daytime. With Bomber Command sticking to night raids, this issue was avoided. Doing so also allowed round-the-clock raids on German targets. This put a greater pressure on German morale, as they could be bombed at any time. It also meant that it was harder to recover from raids - if a target was struck by RAF bombers on one night, a USAAC raid the next day would catch the initial attempts at rebuilding.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/4b063480b17d46a0a6a09dbde69823fc.png)  

&gt; Labi Siffre (born June 25, 1945) is an English poet, songwriter and singer.

&gt; Born the fourth of five children, at Queen Charlotte's Hospital Hammersmith, London to a Barbadian / Belgian mother and a Nigerian father, Siffre was brought up in Bayswater and Hampstead and educated at a Catholic monastery school, St Benedict's School, in Ealing.

&gt; Jazz and Blues records provided his musical education: Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis and Charlie Mingus among many. Jimmy Reed and Wes Montgomery loomed large as guitar influences; Billie Holiday, Jimmy Reed and Mel Tormé as vocal influences.

&gt; In July 1964 he met his partner Peter Lloyd. Under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, they became legally recognised partners when the Act entered into force in December 2005.

&gt; His first six albums of songs were released between 1970 and 1975, and a further three albums between 1988 and 1998. In the early 1970s he had solo hits with ""It Must Be Love"" (No. 14, 1971) (later covered by and a No. 4 hit for Madness, for which Siffre himself appeared in the video); ""Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying"" (No. 11, 1972); and ""Watch Me"" (No. 29, 1972).

&gt; In 1978 two of his songs, ""Solid Love"" (performed by Siffre) and ""We Got It Bad"" (co-written and performed by Bob James) reached the UK finals of the BBC's A Song for Europe.

&gt; His 1987 hit ""(Something Inside) So Strong"", which reached No. 4, an anti Apartheid anthem and more, has remained enduringly popular and is an example of the political and sociological thread running through much of Siffre’s lyrics and poetry since the single “Thank Your Lucky Star” and the album “For the Children” (1973). It won the Ivor Novello Award for ""Best Song Musically and Lyrically"", and has been used in Amnesty International campaigns, a television advertisement and Alice Walker's film against female genital mutilation: Warrior Marks. His stance on civil and human rights has further enhanced his reputation.

&gt; His play, ""DeathWrite"", staged at the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff 1997 was later televised.
For rapper Eminem's hit single ""My Name Is,"" hip hop record producer Dr. Dre wanted to use a sample (written by Siffre and including Siffre on electric piano) of his song ""I Got The..."" for the rhythm track. Siffre, objected to what he describes as ""lazy writing"" (in the sleeve notes of the re-mastered CD of the source album Remember My Song): ""Attacking two of the usual scapegoats, women and gays, is lazy writing. If you want to do battle, attack the aggressors not the victims"".

&gt; Eminem and Dr Dre had to edit to get the sample cleared. The original bootlegged version can be downloaded on file-sharing networks.

&gt; Searching for expression beyond the ""limitations of songwriting"" he wrote his first poems in 1984. Three books of his poetry have been published: ""Nigger"" 1993, ""Blood on the Page"" 1995 and ""Monument"" 1997.

&gt; His poetry addresses ""wide ranging themes of theology, childhood, supposed adulthood, sociology, love, hate, language, critical thinking and the lack of it, communication, various ""isms"" and the methods by which the mainstream dismisses the marginalised and the dispossessed"".

&gt; He released a new album, The Last Songs, in 2006.

So in that example PCA would tell you that there's something unique about French/German/Italian ancestry, and it would also tell you that there's something different between the European group and the 5 outlier group.

&gt;* The baby was traveling on one of two rubber boats carrying over 200 migrants from North and Central Africa, Sri Lanka and Yemen and seen drifting some 22 nautical miles north of the Libyan town of Sabratha, the most frequently used departure point currently used by people smugglers in Libya.

&gt;* Migrants were transferred into the former fishing trawler Golfo Azzurro, expected to reach the Sicilian port town of Augusta on Sunday afternoon.

&gt;* A week ago, I collected a dead body from the Mediterranean for the first time, and (Saturday) I carried a new life, Daniel Calvelo, the 26 year-old who transferred the baby from the raft into the rescue boat, told Reuters.

&gt;* Italy has become the main arrival point in Europe for people fleeing persecution and poverty in Africa, most of them crossing the Mediterranean from lawless Libya in search of a better life.

&gt;* Nearly 600 migrants have died so far this year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, the International Migration Organization (IOM) estimates.

Can we at least stop doing this then? Ferrying people in is the last thing we should do.


&gt;Lawyers for Justice in Libya director Elham Saudi said of the Libya deal: “It is wrong for the EU to enter into an agreement with a country that has no concept of asylum and no refugee protection. The EU knows that torture, rape and killing occur in these camps. Even the basics are not there – there is no registration, there are no records, there is no one counting them, there is no legal process, there is no access to a lawyer, there is no accountability, there is nothing. It is a facade and yet the EU celebrates this agreement which is a way of being complicit in torture.”

They don't have to stay in those camps you know. I understand that it costs money to return, but perhaps that is the only thing where we could contribute to.

Esimerkiksi tämä määritelmä voisi korvata kiihottamisen kansanryhmää vastaan *ja* uskonrauhan, molemmat. Samat asiat löytyvät kyllä hallituksen esityksistä mikä on kansanryhmä, mutta kun vain harva lukee hallituksen esitykset, niin ehkä on parempi kertoa tarkemmin.:

&gt;Euroopan neuvoston ministerikomitean suosituksessa (R 97 20) vihapuhe on määritelty seuraavasti:"" Vihapuhetta ovat kaikki ilmaisumuodot, jotka levittävät, lietsovat, edistävät tai oikeuttavat etnistä vihaa, ulkomaalaisvastaisuutta, antisemitismiä tai muuta vihaa, joka pohjaa suvaitsemattomuuteen. Tämä koskee niin aggressiivista suvaitsematonta kansalaismielisyyttä kuin vähemmistöjen, siirtolaisten, ja siirtolaistaustaisten ihmisten syrjintää ja vihamielisyyttä heitä kohtaan.

&gt;EN:n vihapuhelinjauksella ei ole mitään väliä, tuomioistuimet Suomessa ei jaa oikeutta sen perusteella. 

Kyllä on väliä, koska lainsäädännössä on hallituksen esityksissä otettu huomioon EN:n suositukset ja lisäksi kansainvälisiä sopimuksia jne. Otetaan jatkossakin, koska olemme osa EU:ta. Oikeuskäytännössä ja lakia tulkitessa hallituksen esitys kertoo tarkemmin mitä lailla halutaan saavuttaa. Lue esimerkiksi HE 317/2010. Tällä mm. Halla-aho tuomittiin ja tähän tuomiossa viitattiin.

&gt;Vihapuhe-termiä käytetään silloin kun halutaan laittaa jollekin leima jota ei tartte mennä puolustamaan oikeuteen. Jos, esim. väittää poliittisen vastustajan kirjoitusta vihapuheeksi, on hyvin epätodennäköistä et kirjoittaja pystyy saamaan sen oikeuden käsiteltäväksi. Jos taas kutsuu samaa kirjoitusta kiihotukseksi kansanryhmää vastaan pääsee helposti oikeuteen syytettynä kunnianloukkauksesta, jos kirjoitusta ei ole todettu oikeudessa kiihotukseksi.

Tästä olemme yhtä mieltä, muuten mutta kyse ei ole halusta vaan siitä, että viharikosta ja vihapuhetta ei tunneta lainsäädännöllisenä terminä. Kuten juuri itse kuvasit, niin kaikenlaista paskaa saa kirjoittaa joutumatta mihinkään vastuuseen ja syytekynnys on korkea.

&gt;Kunnianloukkausessa on kyse väärän tiedon levittämisestä, ja koska vihapuhe-termiä ei ole määritelty laissa ja se on muutenkin epämääräinen, minkä tahansa asian kutsuminen vihapuheeksi on turvallista ja siksi se on niin kätsy termi, kun halutaan vaikka erottua poliittisten vastustajien mielipiteistä.

Juuri näin, mutta ennen kaikkea kunnianloukkaus on asianomistajarikos. Lisäksi on vielä yksityiselämää loukkaava tiedon levittäminen, joka sekin on asianomistajarikos. Näitä ei siis voi soveltaa, kun on kyse ryhmästä ihmisiä eikä näitä katsota yhteiskunnan asioiksi alkaen syyttämisprosessista.

On hassua, että kun perustelen miksi vihapuhe ja viharikos pitäisi saada rikoslakiin korvaamaan nykyisiä lakeja, niin sinä jankutat ettei laki tunne vihapuhetta. Politiikassa erottumiseen ei tarvita vihapuhetta ainakaan siinä muodossa missä minä sen ymmärrän. Asioista voi olla eri mieltä ja sen eron tunnistaa ilmankin. Politiikassa vihapuhe on erittäin harvinaista. Lähinnä se on tullut eteen maahanmuutosta puhuttaessa ja maahanmuuttopolitiikastakin voi olla erilaisia mielipiteitä ilman vihapuheita.",0,Skrivari,Suomi,False,0,True,flair-espoo,t3_62ye5y,False,dfqegsj,1491152194,Saa mankeloida,,0,1493730856,

Foste tu que falaste do Mourinho, quando falaste do Porto Campeão Europeu. E eu só disse que esta época temos jogado como o Mourinho jogava, simplesmente com piores jogadores. Mas na ""atitude"" ou ""mística"" ou lá o que queiras criticar com a ""sportinguização"", estamos iguais

Ontem o Porto foi obrigado a sofrer mais do que queria porque não soube sair a jogar, por falta de qualidade, e das vezes que soube o Soares falhou e o árbitro decidiu ver um fora de jogo inexistente

Garanto-te que se tivéssemos o Deco teríamos jogado de forma igual mas provavelmente ganho porque teríamos saído com muito mais qualidade, e aí a conversa já era diferente, como acontece sempre com quem percebe pouco de futebol. Está bem que temos o Brahimi, mas não lhe chega aos calcanhares

Como os paineleiros que mudam de opinião dum momento para o outro, hoje o Porto já é o maior, no princípio da época era a miséria, quando se calhar houve jogos melhores do Porto no princípio da época em que a bola simplesmente não entrou por azar e azelhice

&gt; Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine are a cover band and comedy act based in Los Angeles, California. The band's name is a play on that of rock band Rage Against The Machine, and Cheese's pseudonym is a reference to smegma. The band specializes in playing jazz and lounge covers of popular rock and rap tunes from the last thirty years, particularly those with offensive lyrical content...

&gt; Since 2000, the band has played concerts around the U.S.A. and Europe, and has made numerous television appearances, including performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Fox News Channel, CNN, and as the house band on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly and MTV's Say What? Karaoke series.

t1_dfqbhjx,t5_2qhcv,"&gt; Why should we offer to defend Germany, if they don't want to trade with us?

We don't ""defend"" Germany, we trade intelligence.

&gt;  What did they do for is during the Falklands, Gulf War etc.

What did the USA do for us during the Falklands? France? Anybody? *Nobody* helped us.

The people of Germany protested en masse against military involvement in the Gulf War (you might say it was ""the will of the people""), and their constitution sanctioned war only in self-defence anyway - [it was a matter of huge debate](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-approves-militarys-new-role-1534923.html), not just a simple ""hmm, should we go help the British in a clearly legal war?"".

&gt; Their contribution to the wars in The Former Republic of Yugoslavia and Afghanistan were negligible.

We didn't exactly play a huge part in the Yugoslav Wars either.

I can hardly see being a minor contributor to the War in Afghanistan as a bad thing. Regardless, Germany was the only European ally tho get involved to begin with.

&gt; The Yugoslav wars weren't resolved untill America got involved because Europe is so useless on defence.

While it might have been a US initiative, it was NATO that involved itself in the Yugoslav Wars - not just the USA, and certainly not just Britain or Germany.

&gt; Also can you imagine the panic in Eastern Europe if we pulled out of NATO, especially if France leaves the EU. Suddenly the EU will be left with no nukes and the membership of 23 of the 28 members of NATO is in doubt as they don't pay 2% of GDP on defence.

What? No it isn't. The 2% target [does not come into full effect until 2024](http://www.iiss.org/en/militarybalanceblog/blogsections/2017-edcc/february-7849/counting-to-two-67c0), and [not even we managed to meet the target last year](http://www.politico.eu/article/uk-doesnt-meet-natos-defense-spending-target-report/).

&gt; Germany is quite happy to sit back and allow the US, France and the UK to pay for its defence, now it will have to live with the consequences.

In no way do we ""pay for its defence"". That is an utterly moronic statement that I can only imagine you heard from Trump.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

  My guess from the stamping is that he is or is attempting to be a quality carver. For one thing there is the stamping, which is not an ""afterthought"", and secondly the minor sand pit is ignored.

I have this theory about sand pits... which boils down to the fact that some carvers view a pit as just part of the wood, and live with it, as contrasted with trying to disguise or hide it.  They will recognize it in the sense of grading, just as they would grain quality, but they accept it.

I honestly have no idea what you mean. Out of 206 sovereign states, 193 are in the UN. That flag might as well be saying ""Hey, I'm from planet Earth."" It conveys no message as do all the other non-state flags.

What would the Olympic flag ever convey? ""I too am watching the Olympics!""?

t1_dfq1oxu,t5_2s9nc,"&gt;I've been in both Tajikistan and Iran, and Tajiks on average look much more white/european than Iranians do.

The reason for that is because Tajikistan (and Central Asia in general) was mostly depopulated when the Indo-Europeans moved in.

Iran, on the other hand, was already settled and had numerous civilizations already residing there. You have cities like Shiraz and Isfahan that were over 4000 years old, before any Indo-European arrived in Iran.

Hakhamaneshid-era Iranians, by that time, were likely a mixture of Indo-Europeans and whatever the native population of the Iranian plateau were. And like all steppe nomads, the Indo-Europeans were probably the minority population from the beginning, as nomads tend to have much lower population than settled people. By the time of Cyrus Iranians were already mixed, so even ancient Persians weren't ""pure"" Indo-European. Hence why modern Iranians have only around 25% European admixture, and roughly 50% from the Caucasus/West Asia. There's a good chance that the pre-Indo European population of Iran were the same people as ancient Caucasus and Anatolian people, given the genetic similarities between Iranians, Anatolian Turks, and South Caucasians.

Furthermore, Tajikistan also has a higher latitude than Iran and receives less UV radiation, so as a result Tajiks would adapt to have lighter skin, over the course of thousands of years.

You can see examples of Achaemenid reliefs at Persepolis, they have the same facial features and skin tone as modern Iranians.

Furthermore, genetic studies on Iranians show them to have something like 10% Arab admixture, which shows that simply being conquered by foreigners doesn't result in much genetic change.",6,amir_kabir,iranian,1491162709,0,True,net,t3_62n7tj,False,dfqf0yw,1491152925,Irānzamin,,0,1493731126,
