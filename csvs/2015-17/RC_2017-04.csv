desculpa a demora, envolvi-me em conversas paralelas com transfóbicos. fico feliz em ver que concordas com quase tudo, uma vez que começaste por dizer que discordavas de 'vários pontos' em relação à tese do *imperialismo intensifies. mas vamos a essas nuances:

&gt; Brexit
&gt;&gt; Podemos, podemos. A incerteza que lhe estou a associar é ao porquê de quererem sair e se os problemas deles eram realmente a EU ou eram outros e ainda nãos e aperceberam disso.

essa incerteza parece-me *contraproducente*, se não for apresentada uma teoria alternativa. a tese de 'o tempo dirá' não chega. além disso, penso que o argumento económico que apresentei **já** permite perceber porquê. sinceramente não vejo que outra teoria possa surgir entretanto, capaz de explicar o brexit e os outros fenómenos... mas obviamente posso estar enganado.
 
&gt; Por questão históricas e geográficas, o UK vai-se manter entre a EU e os USA. Falta é saber o que vão conseguir tirar daqui.

nada. porque os EUA do Trampa devorariam o UK, em termos económicos, se o UK fizesse dos EUA o seu principal parceiro económico. 

além disso, os próprios ingleses já disseram várias vezes que se iam voltar para a Commonwealth: por exemplo, que iam [acelerar a emissão de visas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/11/commonwealth-citizens-should-have-uk-visas-fast-tracked-brexit/) desses países, ou que a Commonwealth era a [tábua de salvação](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-commonwealth-visas-immigration-could-save-britain-a7307066.html) do UK e principal [solução económica](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-brexit-commonwealth-free-trade-meeting-2018-uk-london-chair-a7625791.html). isto não quer dizer que vão colonizar esses países de novo, mas que vão recorrer ao imperialismo económico extrativista (como a UE e os EUA já fazem em África e na América Latina).

de qualquer forma, mesmo que se voltassem principalmente para os EUA como dizes... os EUA *são* uma antiga colónia, o que reforçaria a tese de que se estão a voltar para o antigo império. 

&gt; Propaganda
&gt;&gt; Nem foi esse o meu ponto. Mas foi um facto muito importante. Os tablóides britânicos não começaram com a propaganda anti-EU no ano passado. A cada de ontem do The Daily Mirror fala em Freedom [...] Não, estou a dizer que também entraram em propaganda mas nem sequer a souberam fazer. Mas, para além da propaganda, no que diz respeito à campanha em si, o lado do Remain não se empenhou devidamente.

não sei porque dizes que o Remain não se empenhou na campanha. além disso, se não era com o objetivo de arranjar uma explicação alternativa à da reação estatista e nacionalista à globalização económica, e se admites que a propaganda não explica a saída, então não serve para nos fazer ignorar a tese económica que apresentei. é óbvio, como já disse, que os media desempenham um papel cada vez mais importante, mas não são a explicação da situação, nem permitem refutar a outra tese.

&gt; jovens urbanos vs. idosos rurais
&gt;&gt; Era no sentido figurativo.

o que queres dizer com isso? e para quê introduzir esse argumento então?

de resto, o argumento não é falso, e reforça a tese da reação à globalização económica.

&gt; O problema não tem de ser explicado por um só factor. São vários: abstenção dos jovens, sentimento anti-EU, propaganda dos tablóides, crise económica, negligencia de Londres, etc.

não disse que o brexit podia ser explicado apenas por um factor. disse que era possível compreender o brexit e outros fenómenos mundiais à luz de uma determinada teoria. tal como a teoria da seleção natural na biologia, não impede que se estude cada uma das espécies de forma isolada. mas, o facto de cada espécie possuir características próprias e únicas, não refuta a tese mais geral.

&gt; a tese da reação à globalização económica neoliberal permite, sozinha, compreender todos os exemplos que dei inicialmente
&gt;&gt; Eu não discordei disto. Acho é que cada um dos fenómenos tem outros factores em causa para além disso.

concordo. mas não disse que a teoria explicava tudo em relação a esses fenómenos. e também há fenómenos que a teoria não explica. disse apenas que esta teoria permite perceber o sistema económico mundial e o momento conturbado que atravessa, e não que explica tudo sobre eles. claro que podemos analisar cada um dos exemplos que dei segundo a história única de cada país, e das condições sociológicas únicas de cada estado/nação/mercado, mas isso não invalida a procura de uma teoria geral.

&gt; Ciências exatas são bem distintas de Ciências Sociais. Aquilo que falas de as melhores teorias são as que descrevem mais problemas faz sentido para as Ciências Exactas. Para ciências sociais as coisas são um bocado diferentes. 

a distinção entre ciências exatas (só o termo 'exatas' dava horas de conversa) e ciências sociais é questionável e, do ponto de vista da filosofia da ciência, já fez correr muita tinta, não sendo clara a diferença entre os termos. por exemplo, dirias que a biologia é uma ciência exata? ou a física, na sua vertente cosmológica? 

além disso, as ciências sociais **também** seguem o princípio da navalha de Occam, como todas as ciências, porque, em todas, a ideia não é multiplicar teorias ad infinitum mas encontrar teorias e métodos cada vez mais poderosas/os e abrangentes. 

&gt; No fundo, não discordo muito da tua opinião. Só acho é que não há necessidade de explicar todos os fenómenos actuais da mesma forma. Cada um deles tem as suas nuances, ainda que possamos traçar vários padrões entre eles.

o facto de terem nuances -claro que têm- não pode invalidar uma teoria geral. 

a única forma de refutar uma teoria geral é apresentar outra teoria geral melhor, capaz de explicar tantos ou mais fenómenos e, de preferência, de maneira mais simples. Einstein ultrapassa Newton porque a sua teoria consegue explicar os mesmos fenómenos da teoria newtoniana... mas ainda mais. qualquer ciência se guia por esse princípio da navalha, incluindo as ciências sociais. por exemplo, o paradigma da escolha racional, usado por economistas, ou a teoria do sistema económico mundial, usada pela sociologia económica. a beleza das ciências sociais é que, na sua procura dessas teorias gerais ou nomotéticas, consegue incorporar as outras dimensões únicas ou ideográficas, por exemplo através da etnografia, algo que uma ciência como a química obviamente não consegue dada a natureza dos seus objetos de estudo.
 
&gt; A situação geopolítica da União Soviética era diferente da Rússia actual. Mas os problemas com a Ucrânia vêm pós 2010, com o Yanukovych a querer aproximar a Ucrânia da Rússia mas depois levar com vários protestos. Claro que a crise económica está sempre associada a tudo. Mas o que levou a Rússia a invadir a Crimeia foram razões geo-estratégicas - Sevastopol é o único porto que não congela na Rússia. Para o mindset russo, a Crimeia não poderia cair sobre influência da NATO.

a tua tese inicial é que era algo *inerente* aos próprios russos. de resto, como é que a nova tese da geo-estratégia não vem reforçar e confirmar a tese do imperialismo económico? é exatamente disso que se trata, todas essas movimentações são os russos a tentar lutar pela hegemonia do mercado mundial, mostrando que o seu estado e nação são fortes e não se submetem facilmente às imposições económicas do mercado mundial controlado pelos EUA (e UE, já que o euro serve de tampão ao dollar, e vice-versa).

&gt; Os USA são uma potencia nos dois maiores oceanos: Atlântico e Pacífico. Os seus vizinhos, Canada e México, são bastante estáveis. A China está limitada ao Mar do Sul da China e o acesso ao Pacífico fica limitado pelo Japão e pelas outras ilhas até à Indonésia. A China está agora a desenvolver a sua frota marítima. Até então nunca teve grande frota, mesmo tendo uma economia muito importante. Em termos de desenvolvimento económico, a China ainda tem muitos passos para dar, principalmente porque só as suas zonas costeiras é que estão desenvolvidas e a sua economia está totalmente dependente de exportações. Ser um superpotência é mais do que ter a melhor economia. Em termos geopolíticos, os USA têm a tarefa muito mais facilitada que a China para serem uma superpotência.

pensa assim: se mesmo com essas limitações todas a China já apanhou os EUA em termos de PIB ajustado ao poder de compra, e se a China já é dos maiores detentores de dívida externa dos EUA, imagina se começarem a desenvolver a sua frota naval ou o interior. e estar dependente de exportações, é melhor que estar dependente de importações. aliás, é o objetivo de todas as economias. já para não falar do poder militar chinês e do facto de possuírem o maior exército do mundo. 

não nos iludamos, a China está a segundos de ser a hegemonia mundial (ironicamente, a capa da revista EXAME que me chegou hoje por correio é com o presidente do conglomerado chinês FOSUN, e o título é «o novo dono disto tudo»). o único problema deste cenário é que os EUA, como qualquer potência hegemónica, não vão abdicar de ânimo leve do seu poder económico e cultural, e vão cair a lutar, fazendo sofrer o mundo inteiro. 

&gt; Para finalizar: Como disse, eu concordo com grande parte da tua opinião e que há uma versa revisão do passado cíclica. Simplesmente acho que há vários pontos extra que cada fenómeno tem e que vale a pena referir.

However, if it's something you actually want to last for more than 2+ years, you're often better off going with higher-quality stuff, where you're often simultaneously supporting local businesses rather than a foreign company, especially since while it's more expensive the quality is usually much better and it's made of better wood.

Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

Hillary Speech to American Legion, August 31, 2016: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfm4unbyHV0

She mentions how bad Russia is (relating to the purported email hack), and then goes on to say:

&gt; ""As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyberattacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and **military responses.**""

Here's a [The Hill article about her speech](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/293970-clinton-treat-cyberattacks-like-any-other-attack).

Even a [Huffington Post writer agrees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/a-vote-for-hillary-clinto_b_11879812.html) that she wants war with Russia over both the email scandal and the middle east fiasco (both of which are partly her fault, which makes this even worse).

Hillary has also supported a no-fly-zone in Syria, which would lead to some more contentious geopolitical conflict.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53

Not only is it very clear that she wanted war with Russia, her purported presidential policies would take us in that direction too.

&gt; Wanting to discourage a hostile foreign nation from meddling in our internal politics

Yes, she wants to discourage Russia with political, economic, and military responses (as well as no fly zones). Discourage by war, as I said earlier. The worst part about all of this is that her hatred towards Russia is all *personal*. The Podesta files were a character assassination towards her, and she blames Russia. As secretary of state, she had a hand in the Arab Spring fiasco and subsequent European Migrant Crisis; she blames Russia. 

That would be like Trump threatening Japan as President because a few years ago he didn't like some business deals on Trump hotels or something; completely personal, and shows terrible authoritarian leadership.

Is this because our healthcare is worse or because our citizens are sicker due to poor diet and lack of exercise?

Single payer wouldn't fix that issue at all; if anything, it'd make it worse because then there's no financial consequence of the poor decisions that people are content to make, as other people end up footing the bill via taxes.

Seeing as Nintendo has stated they are breaking sales records in the west every day, as recently as last week, MCV has determined that the 2 million goal has been surpassed thanks to western sales. They note that the driving force was Zelda which as of mid March, was purchased by 89% of owners of the Switch.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

1491015943,dfogsze,,,t3_61cbrb,False,1493697235,0,mike3,t5_2sae9,t1_dfg0xwz,1,"""He also said humans are equal, but Africans are equal to cows. ""

I think there is a legitimate point to be made here but I would disagree with your phrasing of it. It is not that Africans are ""equal to cows"" but rather that the claim is they lack ""education"" and so are or were at least at the time like ""savages"" -- I cannot verify that cow quote, but even with it the idea is that they lack education and like an animal due to the lack of education, not that they are ""equal"" to cows. Indeed there are other quotes in the Baha'i texts that are consistent with this that when humans lack education they become ""lower than the animal"". So when viewed in that context and suitable sensitivity to details, it is not inconsistent with the rest of the religion, for the relevant point is education, or rather lack thereof; not racial or biological inferiority.

On the other hand, that notion is still one that is not exempt from problematics in its own right. In particular, if Africans are uneducated so as to be like animals, savages, or lesser, then who is ""educated""? Moreover, who is to ""educate"" the African? From other things it seems the Europeans, the WHITE man, are spoken of more positively as being the educated and civilized one. Yet cursory accusations of racism aside it goes rather deeper than that. From where does this education arise? What does education mean in this context? Also, why isn't anything positive given of the traditional form of society in those places? The Baha'i theory goes that the ultimate root of education is God and is sent into the world through the Manifestations of God. Yet the religion states that no one would be left without a Manifestation, or that if they did not have one directly, they would hear of one. Thus for Africans to not be educated it would mean no Manifestations would have been sent their way. Why would God do this? In lieu of a Manifestation, how was it expected they were to receive education? By the White man, going and ""teaching"" them? Let us not forget how vile and ahem, ""savage"" the ""White man"" was in doing what he thought was good in that regard! Worse yet it sounds almost like it could be an _endorsement_ of colonialism, which is very difficult to reconcile with the moral center of the religion because colonialism involved much in the way of evil being done. And furthermore it devalues indigenous non-White culture as ""uneducated"" -- yet from my own readings of African and Native American culture, while they may not have necessarily had the same _technological_ prowess they nonetheless were possessed of what in my estimation is _greater_ _wisdom_ in some areas than the white European man. Keep in mind the European man's ""civilization"" is full of damage to the environment, promotes the idea of justice as vengeance and punition (which does not really help very much), and other things while many of the Native Americans' cultures, while nonetheless not perfect of their own, had rather more sane approaches to that type of stuff, as did some traditional African, even with things like the traditional concept of ""Ubuntu"" in the Southern African region. Although again, to be fair to Baha'i, it _does_ say at some point that ""the materialistic civilization when carried to excess will prove as every bit a source of evil as it has been of good"" or something to those words -- not exact but I'm too lazy at this instant to go look it up and want to focus on writing this message -- but nonetheless while it does suggest that European type civilization ""can"" be a source of evil, I have not heard of a quote that says Indigenous African / Native society and culture could be a source of good, wisdom, or things associated with being educated in addition to being a source of things not good at least. Though maybe I could be wrong and just haven't seen it. Now I suppose you could say that ""well maybe it's true, so then it's not racist if it's true"" but I think the key problem with it though is that it is simply not true, not given what I know of traditional indigenous cultures.

&gt; 

Indeed. I edited it out cause I wanted to think about it. It was a very reactionary post.

&gt;Don't confuse this with ""Western values"".

Mhm. I mention it cause it was the most recent time, off the top of my head, that there was a stated intention of actually planting the seeds of those values in a nation.



&gt; but I also understand the establishment's motivation for pushing it through.

Oh, the establishment's motives are not unknown or necessarily unreasonable, they merely involve realist -and thus sometimes ugly-incentives rather than liberal ones is the point.

&gt;Europe, still in recovery after WWII has been struggling to point the finger at others when it comes to breaching human rights. I think this is because of our history of wars and violence.

Maybe there is a moral relativism problem, I just tend to lean on the side that the reason Europe doesn't get dragged into things is not cause of moral relativism but because it's *inconvenient* to their political goals. PM David Cameron for example made a similar pragmatic argument about the Saudis as you did, he didn't say ""the Saudis culture is as nice as ours"" It's better to just...carry on and not care, beyond a few words from departments here and there. It's not done cause people in Leftist departments are taught to share the talking stick with people that would hog it, but because it costs less, in the eyes of the people making policy (though obviously in democracies leftists help drive policy)

That's the crux of the issue: If that explanation is the correct one, then the problem is much deeper. If it isn't and it really is moral relativism that's relatively easier to solve. People can just wake up from the fever dream. If it is about international interests then...well, changing those is harder than changing yourself. 

That is the question here; difficulty. That doesn't mean that changes still shouldn't be made but it does affect how hard you think certain changes will be to get.

(Europe has pointed fingers of course, at Milosevic and Ghaddafi but I don't know where you'd rank those in terms of size and impact.)
&gt;Europe has been pushing a middle ground where every idea can live together, but this is simply not achievable, if we are to judge by evidence so far.

&gt;I don't support Trump, and I don't know where you get that idea from in my post.

That wasn't about you. That post went through like six edits and so things may have been left out. It was originally part of a tangent about people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali who cherrypick what they want from people like Trump and defend it, providing cover for the actual person.

The point being that the problem with intervention is that you don't always choose your allies *or* your leaders, and their intentions may be markedly different from yours or just tainted, just as Trump's stated ones are (hopefully) different from Ali's. So, one has to be very careful about the allies you pick in these battles.


&gt;The Rwandan genocide is just about the most influential incident for our senior politicians today. This is the reason (in addition to the ""success"" of the Bosnian war) why so many of the Western leaders believe in interventions. Not sure why you would even bring that up as a counter argument against ""neo-cons"".

It wasn't against neo-cons. It happened on Clinton's watch.

Do you know how many times I've had to explain to people that, no, the first slave owner in America was not a black man.

Seriously, even with a passing glance of US history that itself is an illogical statement easily disproven and yet still widespread here.

EDIT TO ADD: Just so we can use this as a learning experiment: So there is a group of (usually ignorant, racist, white guys) who like to cite a a man named Anthiny Jackson as being the first slave owner in America, with the irony being that Jackson was black. Well, heres the thing: Jackson wasn't the first slave owner in America, be he black or otherwise. He himself was a slave who was brought to America and later gained freedom, and even prior to his arrival, the Europeans had already enslaved natives and other Europeans. So no matter what way you wish to spin it, it doesn't work. The only notable thing about Jackson is that he was the 1) First slave to become free who 2) became wealthy from 3) owning slaves as somewho was not 4) from America or Europe.

I see positivity as a two-way street. One way is to keep positivity in, with dates and nice food and fun. The other way is to keep negativity out, like getting enough sleep to stay sane or meditating to assure yourself that you are on the right path. Medicine is a journey that never stops, but it's also a blessing that never stops giving you experiences to help you grow as a person.

The road is harsh now, and the fun times seem to fade, but we enter medicine believing there is a greater experience than an all-nighter in the city. That doesn't make us egotistical sadists for subjecting ourselves to long hours of studying and work, and it doesn't make the party people lazy hedonists for choosing to party when there's a test next week. Everyone has a different story, and this is the part of your story where motivation isn't what saves you: your discipline and desire to achieve your dreams will carry you through.

I stay positive by accepting that I'm doing what I can. I can't go to Europe and shadow 10 different specialties with the super-cool internship. I can't afford the multi-thousand dollar MCAT course to study with ""professionals"" to get a 527.5. And I don't have time for a party every weekend and feel like a human being once in a while. All I know is that my abilities improve a bit each day, and as long as I don't have a zero-day (doing nothing), then I made progress. I have several hundred days of progress to make, and I trust myself to make it happen while staying personable enough to tell my story to a white coat at interview day.

I would expect more of the same sorts of things from Hilary.  Perhaps if you come from the left you supported these sorts of things, but surely you wouldn't argue that they were good for the farmer's bottom line (which is the criticism of Trump you focused on).

Better to spend the money on advertising in Europe and Asia and take the profits from those.

Come on, you know that is unfair. I provided sources to back up my position. You can't just call me willfully ignorant because I present historical facts which make your culture look murderous and shit.

&gt; You have this anti white, anti western conclusion and that is how you build your narrative. 

You have it backwards. My criticisms of white western cultures are a product of critically studying modern western and world history. You're the one mindlessly regurgitating Eurocentric prejudices and narratives. And you are outraged because I do not do the same. This is almost like a religion for you.

&gt; No one claims that there is no violence or tragedy in Western history. The claim is that because enlightenment happened life in general is better in the west NOW no matter of race, sex or religion.

And that claim is also being rejected. You only need to ask Black people, native Americans, Latinos, Gypsies, Romani, Muslims etc. living in the West how superior western culture is. It's quite shit to be honest, especially if you happen to be black (then it is life-threateningly dangerous). 

&gt; The statistics show it.

Which ones? Most stats I have seen show that Africans, Arabs, Turks, Indians, Chinese etc. suffer from huge and systemic discrimination in western European states. One study I recently came across demonstrated that having an African or Muslim name instantly decreased your chances of landing a job by a huge margin.  

&gt;  I live in the Netherlands and I can guarantee you that there are few countries if any (definitely not in any Muslim country) where a Jew or a black man can be more safe and have more opportunities to have blissful life. 

You're delusional. It is pretty much open season against anybody with an immigrant background in the Netherlands. Wilders and his crew may have lost but his appeal and support is far-reaching. They'll start launching pogroms against Muslims, African, Turks, Indonesians etc. in the next few years. Mark my words. 

&gt; And yes you are racist, in fact it is all about race for you and yes you are a SJW and yes you are a regressive. 

But I don't have anything against white people, genetically or physically. I have a problem with mass-murderous white western cultures.  

&gt;You are the kind of person that thinks that Ayan Hirshi Ali and Maajid Nawaaz are porch monkeys and apologists. 

I am not one their admirers, no. Why don't you put aside your faux outrage and rationally consider the fact that there have always been bed wenches and porch monkeys throughout colonial history? This isn't something new. We still live in a neocolonial world so those same depraved sellouts are needed to propagandize for murderous white western culture.

&gt; I'm sorry but I'm done arguing with you. If you can't be sincere and insist on being a troll we have nothing to talk about. Have a nice life. 

I am still open to discussion. I enjoy discussing and debating with people who's view radically differ from my own. I find it illuminating.  I am sorry that your Eurocentric ""west is da best"" ideology prevents you from having rational and open dialogue.

I made a brief comment about it here (will post a snippet PSA) and you can check it out to keep in mind... 

In fact, it's not so uncommon to get a few friends to chip in together to that monthly fee (USD equivalency to ~$10-$50/month with varied storage and bandwidth options). You can pay by bitcoin by the month, change plans, and then download the content as you wish via FTP/SFTP. Obviously, only 1 person's torrent account can be linked to that seedbox but you and others can privately connect to it and download without a problem through FTP/SFTP/other methods offered by seedbox provider.

&gt; There's a lot of options in /r/seedboxes (which is heavily filled by seedbox companies, so be cautious) - the most popular/easiest to set up are whatbox and seedhost.eu with their shared plan options... check out their subreddit sidebar/FAQs for more...

I've used whatbox and seedhost which work well with most private trackers... others such as bytesized, feral an ultraseedbox are popular but I'd **avoid feral** due to them being hosted in the past with OVH (when what.cd drama went down, read/search more about that in /r/trackers and /r/seedboxes). 

Within your geographic region, there might be other cheaper options but you would have to check if the tracker allows that seedbox... the tracker subbreddit might also be able to suggest ones to further explore.

I'm guessing perhaps his mother is of European background? Anyways, these sorts of people are hilarious. He's trying to stick himself into a crowd of Nazi sympathizers, where some of them follow a nationalist socialist doctrine.

It was Hitler himself who doubted the Armenian people's 'Aryan' identity, he was suspicious of the Armenian people and thought there might have been a large amount of Semitic influence into their gene pool. Armenians are generally lighter than Persians too. The average Persian would probably be lumped together with an Arab (according to these people).

They will always view you as a lesser, they only view people of a European background to have ultimate status (this is even what they claim), not even people from the Caucuses (Chechens, Lezgins, Talysh, Abkhazians, Ossetians, Circassians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians) could fit their definitions.

SIG Pro semi-automatic pistol

USS Iowa (BB-61) fires a full broadside during a target exercise near Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, 1 July 1984.
A gun is a normally tubular weapon or other device designed to discharge projectiles or other material.[1] The projectile may be solid, liquid, gas or energy and may be free, as with bullets and artillery shells, or captive as with Taser probes and whaling harpoons. The means of projection varies according to design but is usually effected by the action of gas pressure, either produced through the rapid combustion of a propellant or compressed and stored by mechanical means, operating on the projectile inside an open-ended tube in the fashion of a piston. The confined gas accelerates the movable projectile down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient velocity to sustain the projectile's travel once the action of the gas ceases at the end of the tube or muzzle. Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed in which case the tube may be dispensed with and a guide rail substituted.
The first devices identified as guns appeared in China around CE 1000. By the 12th century the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century.[2]

God knows, you didn't say what you were studying but I doubt many employers are impressed af when they see Timisoara, Romania on a CV. 

&gt; Are people friendly?

Mostly yes. But watch out for all kinds of scams, people love to take advantage of strangers. Learn basic Romanian before you get here. 

&gt; Are gypsies an issue / something to avoid?

Definitely avoid, gypsies are a problem wherever they are present. This is not racist, it's just the truth. 

&gt; How cheap is Romania?

Depends on your lifestyle, where you come from, your income. Some people live with 400euros a month. I find it difficult even with 1000. Rent can be 150-350 euros for a half decent place. Food I'd say anywhere from 50 to 100 a week. Phone is cheap. Internet is cheap. There's no point in doing any shopping in Romania if you come from other EU countries.  

&gt; Should I exchange money, withdraw from an ATM, or make a bank account?

Open bank account here and transfer money into the Romanian account using Transferwise. Exchanging cash is probably a bit better but I am not sure it's very smart to have large quantities of cash on you. 


&gt; Is it allowed to drink on the street?

No, the fine is pretty hefty. You don't have to drink on the street tho, we have plenty of bars and for the most part they're very cheap. 

&gt; What is the current status with consuming cannabis (does it = jail or doesn't the police care about it)

A lot of people will say something different but the police definitely cares about it. If you get caught they'll fuck you up. Now they don't usually waste too much time trying to get a guy who likes to smoke once in a blue moon but don't sell it. Ever. At all. Even to another guy from uni. And make sure your neighbors don't know about it because there's a very good chance they'll rat on you. 

&gt; Which countries/cities outside of Romania should I opt to visit?

Try to steer away from Bulgaria if you're not very experienced in travelling through shady countries. Bulgaria has nice beaches in the summer, Croatia is close and extremely fun/worth. Ukraine is nice but you need a translator. Moldova...not really worth visiting imho. Hungary has Budapest. 

&gt; How affordable and convenient is traveling to other countries?

silly question. 

&gt; Should I invest time studying Romanian and obtaining a certificate?

Not really. Maybe only if you're really bored. 

&gt; Is English understood by most of the population (will I have trouble communicating on a supermarket/hospital/pharmacy)?

Most young people speak in. But don't expect your 50yo supermarket cashier to speak it.

It'd be a very aggressive and risky move for a weak nation to pull. It feels like the story I wanted to hear all along like the book they hand Winston in 1984. Also, the investigations give me warm fuzzy feelings of hope that make me uneasy.

But, the story does make sense. it explains a lot of people's actions, and their behavior fits the narrative. This is human nature; explain the unknown, and  find patterns to keep us safe and feeling anchored.

So, let's take it as true  that Russia's interfered with our elections.  Let's also assume they're working to isolate certain countries, and to cause distrust and division within them (because why not).

The isolationism has a great explanation. The majority of western Europe has bound together through the E.U., with the support  of the U.S. through the United Nations, and in arms treaties. Russia has tepid relations with most of the western world, and would benefit greatly if these countries weren't bound so tight.


It's also a pattern that fits the narrative. In the UK,  America, Netherlands and currently France, there have been large  movements against ""globalism."" 

Nothing about these movements feel organic, or independently spawned:

* Their goals are identical. 

- Tighter borders, No Refugees(illegal immigrants), and  putting Country first

* They use the same tactics

-  Spamming every story about refugees (or illegal aliens) committing crimes

- Jumping on every terrorist act as a failure of policy 

- Convincing the working class that trade deals, Unions, immigrants and Globalism are taking their jobs.

* They Support each other way too much for an isolationist movement

- They share slogans

- The actively rally for each other


Wanting to divide countries has  an explanation as well. Any country divided is weaker.  This one only works if we assume they intend to cause a fever pitch of division. A country would  have to be in Civil War to not bind together against an enemy.

There's some patterns that implicate a push to separate the parties. Some things remove rationality  and encourage hatred.


* Creating two completely  separate narratives for each party, dragging all political discourse down to accusations of lying:

 - making ""fake news"" a mantra

-  Shutting news agencies out of events

-  Targeted fake articles released on social media

* Vilifying the other side

- Constant claims of corruption and calls for investigations

- Painting enemies as pedophiles 

- Creating inflammatory titles for the other side 

This is where the pattern bothers me. Why would they only target and rile up one side in this? If you really need massive division, it needs to go both ways.

I've spent so much time  (arrogantly) assuming Trump's supporters were just stupid and gullible. I assumed that's how they were so easily duped into believing what's so obviously wrong to the rest of us. 

 From there, it was an easy jump to think they're all innocent pawns who's fears and biases are being  exploited by foreign powers. 

Alternatively, I think of myself as intelligent, and street smart. I can smell a con and spot the con man. So, I didn't fall for it.


I also spent a lot of time in Wonderland though. From both sides, it's been months (years?)  of  investigations that go nowhere, revelations that fizzle out, conspiracy caliber rumors and identical accusations of corruption, treason and lies.

These constant competing messages leave me feeling like up is down and truth is a myth at times. I think we can all admit that there's moments we question *everything*.

 **comment content**: Well I'm gonna talk about presidents since 1958 (beginning of the Vth Republic) because before that they didn't always have as much power as they do nowadays.

Charles de Gaulle : President of the Provisional Government of France (1944-1946) and former member of the military

Georges Pompidou : Prime Minister

Valéry Giscard d'Estaing : Minister of the Economy

François Mitterand : Member of Parliament 

Jacques Chirac : Mayor of Paris and Member of Parliament

Nicolas Sarkozy : President of the Hauts-de-Seine department and Minister of the Interior

François Hollande : President of the Corrèze department and Member of Parliament

Let's look at it another way. De Gaulle aside, all have been doing politics for a while, sometimes they have been working a bit on top of their interest in politics (Sarkozy was a lawyer, Hollande worked at the Court of Audit and was a lawyer for a bit...). They have often been what we call hauts fonctionnaires : public servants at important positions, like at the Court of Audit, the Inspectorate General of Finances, etc...

If you want to become President, it'd be better to be a lawyer or a haut fonctionnaire while already joining a party when you were young, become an assistant for some important MP, then become MP, eventually become Minister then President. That'd be the easiest way to do it

Why the obsession with education? And why the lies?   

Corbyn left secondary school early, and went to a polytechnic, which he left without a degree.  

... Blair was a QC,. Theresa May has a degree in geography from Oxford university (and now rewrites European political geography),  Farron has a BA from Newcastle university. Nicola Sturgeon has a degree in law from Glasgow university. Gordon Brown had a degree and a phd in history, ed miliband had a degree in journalism.   

Corbyn is the least well educated of any current leader and the least educated Labour leader since James Callaghan! Every 1980s and 1990s Labour leader had at least a degree, some (Like Michael Foot) were exceedingly well-qualified.

Models are very useful for sorting data and for trying to make sense of it all, but they invariably fall short of the ""reality"" of things, so to speak. I agree that MBTI is incredibly interesting ( and that testing for MBTI is bullshit ), but ultimately it can only ever be a very, very loose approximation. I've also never seen any MBTI studies done on broad (read not European-ish) populations, which makes me wonder how much of what shows up in MBTI is societally driven. Just a conjecture, really, but one worth considering. Given that there are societies in which the very concept of the ""individual"" as it exists for us does not even occur, and given that we tend to want to group people outside of our own groups into models that closely resemble our own experience of the world (i.e.—society), I'd say we've still got a long way to go. At the very least we've got to be wary of any confirmation biases that might arise when we study outside groups. MBTI was developed by Europeans* to describe patterns within European* societies.   
I'm sorry. This format is pretty limited and all of this is kind of off the cuff. Not that I haven't spent a lot of time worrying over all of this (it's closely related to my own field of study, namely ontology), but it's hard to get it all in in these tiny little boxes.) :) which is kind of my point.   
In the end, the problem with any system of axioms is that the system itself can never be fully axiomatic (re: Gödel)—you can only read the system fully from *outside* of the system; something that we as humans can never really do when studying, well, humans.

I would certainly recommend getting an interrail pass or EU rail pass, that give you unlimited train journeys in and around Europe. When I've dont it in the past, I picked a start point eg. Amsterdam, and an end point, e.g. Berlin, and then made the rest up as I've gone along. There are so many people traveling, that you will make friends, and even the best planned trip you will find other things you want to do, detours you want to make, just by talking to other travellers. I would recommend staying in hostels, even if shared rooms aren't your thing then you can get a private room in a hostel and still benefit from meeting other travellers! Europeans are in general a very friendly bunch! 

The only thing to bear in mind if many European cities close on Sundays, I was in Geneva last Sunday, and nearly all the shops were shut, it was a bit like a ghost town, so while there will still be things to see, any Sundays you're there be prepared for a quieter day!

With regards to waiting for more vacation days, the way I look at it is you'll never have enough, you could spend 6 months travelling Europe and still feel that wasn't enough, so I say if you've got 10 days, use 10 days, you can always come back another time!! 

Places I would recommend (feel free to ignore)
- Amsterdam - No explanation required, just go there
- Brussels - there's a bar called Dellirium which was 3000 odd beers on tap - it's worth a look in
- Munich - The beer halls are fantastic
- Berlin as has already been mentioned for the music - it's also surprisingly good value
- The Matterhorn (zermatt) in Switzerland for the scenery
- Or even Venice if you can make it down that far (might be a push)m just for something a bit different!

My story is similar to yours in that we started dating during my husbands first year of uni, so while we didn't have to wait as long as you guys, I understand the frustration. 

To answer your questions, unfortunately it has to be your husband earning the required £18,600 for 6 months. The UK does not allow for co sponsors. 

Your savings can count, but that's no where near enough. If you fully rely on savings, you would need to hold £62,000 for 6 months untouched. To combine income with savings, you need a minimum of £16,000 plus 2.5 times the shortfall. So even if your boyfriend made £18,500, to makeup the shortfall with savings you would need £100 x 2.5 = £250 + £16000 = £16,250 in savings, untouched for 6 months. 

If you were to manage to get sponsored by a company, a tier 2 would allow you to use your income to meet the requirement. If the applicant is legally working in the UK, their income can be applied towards the requirement. Your challenge is getting a tier 2. Most positions will not be able to sponsor a recent grad as there are lots of recent grads in the UK and EU that don't need sponsorship who could do the same job. You don't say what level your degree is, but a BS in Psychology is usually not enough to practice in the field. You would typically need a master's degree, so if you have a master's, you stand a much better chance.

Ok, English Nationalism;

The big debating problem in England right now is Immigration.

People who voted for Brexit done so because they think it will stop Immigration and deport foreigners en-masse, they are also the same people who normally vote Labour. 

---

Labour currently has a problem because half of its voters see Immigration as the main issue, these mostly are the older-working class-white-nationalist voters outside of London -And the other half are the multi-cultured/multiracial voters inside of London and also include young students in the rest of England.

The problem is Labour haven't drawn a line on Immigration and the Tories promised Brexit, so the voters switched to Tory even though Tory policy goes against their workers rights and benefits and income tax etc.

---

So English Nationalists are screwed by whoever they vote for, whatever they actually believe. They also want a hard border with the EU and Northern Ireland doesn't.

This is why no one is going to be happy with the outcome of Brexit, especially since the Tories get to singlehandedly re-write all of the Eu's laws, including workers rights laws.

This is what people mean when they say we are being walked off a cliff. 

But the main setback is getting people to stop caring about the differences in religion, accent and skin colour and start thinking economically; looking at who's really in charge and what they are doing.

---

The Tories only care about Ni because they need the DUP in the House of commons. The DUP will always vote along side the Tories and the Tories have always had a slim majority at best in the Commons 

(It only takes about 10 Tory MPs to turn against the government -maybe less depending on by-elections -and the DUP have 8 MPs who are there to back them up)

Voldemort calls what Lily Potter did ""ancient magic"", which implies that what she did tapped into the most primal state of magic. No verbal spells, no wands, no casting, just tapping into magic in its ""pure"" state. 

I'd compare it to instances of ""accidental magic"" by young witches or wizards, or what happened with Isolt Sayre ""being able to overcome a curse / spell by hearing her children's cries"" in one Pottermore tale.

From what Rowling's shared on other wizarding schools, particularly the African school of Uagadou (which may or may not be the oldest / largest wizarding school in the world), some deliberately practice wandless and nonverbal magic, and don't use wands. The latter is seen as ""extremely advanced"" by European witches and wizards, but Rowling also says that the Europeans have long since come to rely on wands, albeit somewhat out of laziness, to perform magic.

It's inferred that schools like Uagadou have rigorous training, but, given that they're one of the oldest magic schools in the world, the technique is also similar to what I assume Lily Potter did. Rather than relying on a wand, which she undoutably didn't have at the time, instead, Lily invoked ""ancient magic"" through her own power and magic - nonverbally and wandlessly, the mark of a truly talented / powerful witch - and, as such, something that a vast majority of modern witches and wizards hadn't seen.

Likewise, I think Voldemort both greatly underestimated Lily Potter, and just how powerful / talented she was, out of his own arrogance and ego, and seeing her as ""beneath"" him with him ""superior""...and that Lily would be able to pull of something so out-of-left-field as that. It's no wonder that Lily took Voldemort completely by surprise. Why? Because she just performed a feat of magic that maybe, *maybe* a handful of witches or wizards in Europe could do, Dumbledore included.

As we learn later, Voldemort is aware of such ""ancient magic"", and had likely studied it, seeing as how he's capable of both wandless and nonverbal magic himself with broomless flight...but he just assumed that European witches and wizards, relying on wands, were nowhere near his level of experience, talent, and expertise.

Dumbledore claims that Voldemort lost because of ""love"", and that's partly true. However, at its core, Voldemort, once again, made a huge tactical error, by being so blinded by his elitism and hubris, that he assumed that none others could possibly measure up to his ""greatness"". Rowling shows that Voldemort likely at first had an inkling of Lily's true power, and even offered her and James ""three chances"" to join him.

However, after the Potters refused his offers, Voldemort likely thought Lily and James Potter were ""fools"" for choosing to not only *not* side with him, but also oppose him...and this assumption proved to be Voldemort's undoing.",,1491036985,FanTheories,True,0,

If you stopped people on the street and asked them what, exactly, made a person ""white"", you wouldn't be very successful. Notwithstanding those people who would look at you like you were crazy and hit you with a Mathematician's Answer (""You're 'white' if you're a white person!""), you'd be bound to get one of three common ""definitions"", each of which is fallacious. 

Most people would probably say ""a person with light skin."" Really? That will come as a shock to the many Japanese, Koreans, North Chinese, and Tungus and Manchu peoples who sometimes turn up fairer-skinned than most Europeans. And how, then, do you explain the light-complexioned Arabs (who, having Semitic features, are technically of African stock) of the more northerly parts of the Middle East? Or albinos, who can be of any race but are always lacking pigmentation?


Those who respond in a more pedantic way might say ""a person displaying Caucasoid facial features instead of Mongoloid note  or Negroid ones."" Trouble is, that category would include most of the indigenous peoples of India, who are typically light-red- or brown-skinned, and in the tropical south can have complexions as black as the night. And then, on the other hand, you have light-to-medium-colored Ashkenazi Jews with their decidedly un-Aryan ""hooked noses""; or part-Cherokee American ""whites"", who display the telltale Amerindian curling incisors and elevated cheekbones. 


People for whom ""white = European"" would probably respond with something along the lines of ""a member of any ethnic group claiming political representation or national sovereignty in Europe."" Well, okay...but Eurasia is tectonically one big continent, so where do Europeans start becoming Asians? Historically, Eastern Europe has been said to end at the Ural Mountains in the north, in the Caucasus region (just beyond Ukraine) in the center, and at the Strait of Bosporus in Turkey in the south; but people's physical features do not automatically shift at these borders. And even within the generally accepted boundaries of Europe, what about the Finns, Lapps note  , Estonians, and Hungarians - all of them Uralic peoples, and thus of Asian origin (and occasionally displaying subtle Asian facial markers), and in fact were at one time prohibited from living in certain neighborhoods in the United States because they were deemed not white? What about the Gypsies note , who are usually considered nonwhite but were living as naturalized Europeans long before the modern borders of their host countries were set? What about Bulgarians, who are genetically half-Turkish? And on and on and on...



For all of the above reasons, modern-day anthropologists tend to avoid using the word ""white"" unless it is spoken or written with caveats, preferring the much less racialist terms ""European"" or (for North Americans and Australasians) ""Neo-European."" Otherwise, they would have to constantly waste time explaining ""whiteness"" with the convoluted definition of ""light-skinned people genetically linked to the westernmost part of Eurasia who are not Uralic, Roma, Bulgarian, etc.


"" Perhaps ""white"" will one day disappear from the layperson's vocabulary as well, if its use becomes too controversial and/or people come to believe that if it is wrong to use ""yellow"" or ""red"" as colorist terms, then ""white"" and ""black"" shouldn't be used either.",,False,conspiracy,True,0,

&gt;Okay, all very true. We've moved past that now to a more pan-European of perspective. Sure we see differing abilities and traits between the various groups that make up Whites, and we accept that and move on. Same with Blacks.

That's the thing, you can't move on. You haven't changed when Whites were at their peak, hell it's even worse now. I seen the self hate in Europe. Russians dislike Westerners, vise versa. Ukraine against Russia. Need I mention Yugoslav Wars, which you westerners caused. Irish terrorism in UK, Scotland independence.

&gt;All very true. Nearly everyone on the AR would agree with you on that because we are not Nordicists, but rather Pan-European Nationalists.

Bull, Whites still hate each other as much as Hutus and Tutsis.
You had one chance with the EU and fucked it up. It's every white for himself(like how it always was)

&gt;By whose standards? Mine? 1000 years seems like quite the declaration. Even if it was that intense, Whites have still gotten further than any other group on Earth before or since that time.

White Nationalists always have Roman Statues as avatars. You got further due to Non-White knowledge and inventions, hell you took use of gunpowder from the Chinese and it all went to hell since.

&gt;Okay, all very true. We've moved past that now to a more pan-European of perspective. Sure we see differing abilities and traits between the various groups that make up Whites, and we accept that and move on. Same with Blacks. 

No you have not. Whites still have conflicts with each other, religiously, ethnic and political conflicts. Again if your race can't even make peace with itself at it's peak, you're doomed. It's every European country for itself.

&gt;The point is that you have nothing of merit to speak about. Whites built civilization, at least we've had empires to brag about. 

And no other race did? What do you mean by civilization? Hell Blacks had very strong empires, before Germans were out of their caves; We built monuments.

&gt;Sorry if you don't like truth.

It's just shitposting at this point.

&gt;Surely the elder race would be privy to some level of advancement beyond the newer races. Surely you've some wisdom that your age has given you. If it exists, I haven't seen it.

By that logic, you should dead last in modernization. Again being Eldest doesn't mean we have Alien advance knowledge so far...

&gt;I'd politely disagree.

We'll see.

&gt;Treated you better? Is enslaving over twice the number of Blacks than Whites ever did better? Is capturing slaves for nearly 14 centuries compared to the 3 centuries of Whites better? Whites traded with Africans too, we gave their leader fortunes and they sold out their brethren.

Yep, cause longevity means nothing compare to severity from Whites. What Whites did in 300 years made 1400 look like indenture servitude.  Africans traded with Arabs too, took in Whites.  We had fortunes, Europe barely had any resources to give.

As the manufacturer cost will raise just enough for the next level to keep using them. Same way it's costly and bothersome to keep moving a factory, so it is for an engineer to keep changing country. You never have to match a salary in Germany because the cost of living is much lower. 

Most industries need a lot less engineers than non-specialised labour, it's quite easy to raise their salaries without serious impact to the output cost. And even if you raise the output cost slightly, it won't be enough to move a whole factory, as you said. 

That type of concern is usually with keeping business that might go to their competitors at the same level. Who are facing the same cost increases anyway. 

Over time your economy will converge and plateau, but right now, how would you expect it to work? If you want Romania's standard of living to go up, salaries will go up. Costs will go up. 

The salaries are only part of the problem anyway. I am from the south of Europe, and the other people I meet here in the UK from the south didn't all move for the money. At an engineer type level, I was making good money for the cost of living. 

I moved away from small-minds, corruption, constant negativity, short term thinking, culturally ingrained tax evasion, shitty politicians, etc. And honestly, to meet people with bigger dreams than buying a German car or an American phone.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.
There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.
Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

We have a globalized trade, we form the UN, the NATO or the EU. We are connected through the internet. We read news from across the globe. Everything is tightly interwoven.

That's absolutely true, but it isn't an argument against nations, or even a suggestion that the direction of travel is larger blocks of countries tightly interwoven politically.. If anything you could argue that smaller nations, cooperating ad-hoc and on mutual interests is now far more possible than it has ever been and it minimises the need for large monolithic political constructs that take governance further away from individual people and reduce diversity in terms of policy approaches and similar.  Essentially, within the borders of each state people can make more decisions on how their country is run, further integration reduces those choices and increases the disconnect between state and the person..  We don't need to create more layers of the state above or beside that of the nation state and we don't need to look at rigid frameworks for cooperation in lots of areas. In areas where we want to apply regulation and standards, the approach can be global and loose, rather than regional or local and overly prescriptive..

&gt;In a network the biggest and most attached node is leading a cluster. You become sovereign not in cutting away more and more connections but it is indeed the other way around! This is the fundamental misunderstanding of sovereignty in modern times.

Again, in this context the notion of sovereignty is whether you can act on the will of the people in a given nation. You have to balance the pooling of power and competencies with what people actually want their government to do, there is no inevitable drive toward pooling those powers nor is it intrinsically better to do so under one particular umbrella or another.

It's not about some grand misunderstanding of sovereignty, it is whether people feel and are in control of their destiny and have a choice in how they are governed. As you move power away from people and shift it toward less well understood or more distant groupings and organisations, you breed mistrust and an a feeling of powerlessness.

In regards to salaries you can find various ""Game Dev Salary"" surveys online, they are worth reading up on to give you some hard data to work with.   However salaries vary widely region to region (i.e. - European salaries are notably lower than American salaries on average, but have other benefits like 5 weeks holiday time standard and healthcare), so take into account local factors of where you plan to work when reading that data.

When it comes to specific game design education programs, you are rolling the dice.  While some programs have been maturing over the past 10 - 15 years into respectable processes of learning game development, they all typically tend to be quite expensive and what you may or may not get from them is always up for debate.

If you are truly interested in getting into game development, and you want to take the formal education route, get an education that teaches you how to program.  

Why?  Let me cover a few of the main points:

* The number of job opportunities for coders is significantly higher than game designers.  Game designers are a niche part of the development industry, so there are simply fewer roles.   This is no more important than when you are trying to land your first job.
* Coders get paid more.  Plain and simple.  If money is an important factor, this is an inescapable truth.  Game designers are typically some of the lower paid members of a development team.
* You can take your coding skills and get a job in numerous industries if game development doesn't work out (and there are some nay reason why that could happen).
* As a coder you can still be a designer!  You can build your own prototypes, demos and games directly without relying on someone else.

The Alt Right has its share of autistic shitposters, don't get me wrong, but it's an intellectual movement with a diverse array of opinion. However, we're all in agreement on one thing: the need to preserve and protect white people of European descent. This was a no-brainer position that anybody would have held even half a century ago. Now it's considered grotesquely immoral because the disease of Gloablist Leftism has infected our society to destroy white identity. The Left has efficiently organized every minority group against white interests while simultaneously indoctrinating white racial consciousness out of us through the media and academia, and they've been deadly successful. The Alt Right is a pushback against our ethnic dispossession. Many will blame Jews for this, and they're not entirely wrong. Jews are highly overrepresented in organized efforts to do this, but I do think people tend to get tunnel vision about Jews. Jewish influence wouldn't be so dangerous if there wasn't some loss of racial confidence in ourselves, and I think there are many factors for this, two devastating world wars being some of the key culprits here.

The UK vetoed the scrapping of the lesser duty rule, which would not only have applied to steel but many other things as well. The EU wanted this rule completely removed to help ensure it keeps as many protectionist measures as possible. The UK and 13 other EU nations (so half the EU) sought to block the rule from being scrapped.

The lesser duty rate has a core principle which is that the duty rate that can be applied may be no more than that needed to cover the damage being done. So the tarriff can rise to a high level, it just gets set at a level to reset the price to the normal level and cannot be set to make it higher than that as it would be damaging to any EU business that needs to source that steel. Effectively it corrects the problem and no more.

So:

* The rule is an important one to keep the principles of free trade across many sectors which the UK has always been in favour of and the EU leadership has not.
* This is not the UK vs the rEU, because half the countries in the EU felt the same way as the UK
* The lesser duty rate already includes tariff increases to prevent steel dumping
* However it also includes rules to make sure that steel importers are not harmed by allowing the tariff to go above that of world market prices
* You are knowingly omitting all of these facts to make it seem like the UK was a lone voice and wanted people to lose their jobs in order to promote your pro-EU narrative : I'd suggest that if you have to go to these lengths of deception to defend the EU then maybe they are not worth defending?",eng-GreaterLondon,False,unitedkingdom,True,0,

So still during the negotiations. That's terrible timing and would cause issues because there would then be two different scenarios to negotiate for instead of just one. There would be a UK negotiating under the assumption that Scotland stays in, a Scottish negotiation under the idea that it leaves and the EU looking at both and negotiating both.

Also negotiations are never over until they are signed and done. So there would also be stuff to iron out and what not. And even then there is a chance of some country vetoing and requiring the deal to be re done again.

&gt;Even if there is a yes vote the negotiations for that would be about 2 years (at least I think that was the time frame mentioned last time). At worst there would be 6 months cross over based on the layed out time frames. 

Yeah and during that time there would be some pretty intensive negotiations over stuff like currency, assets, defence, the border and so on. And those negotiations would start immediately and probably be looked into even before the vote has started.

&gt;It would also allow the UK government to give more focus on the remaining UK and how the brexit changes will impact them.

No it would give the UK more things to focus on and a load more things to figure out. As well as making the EU negotiations a whole lot different. That is why it isn't going to happen until after this is over and done with.

&gt; Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985 in Waikiki, Hawaii), better known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is a Filipino-Puerto Rican American singer-songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist signed to Atlantic Records. He is most well known for his hit Just The Way You Are, which went #1 in 9 countries in 2010. He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

&gt; After the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

&gt; He then released his debut album, Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded ""It Will Rain,"" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

&gt; Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette ""Bernie"" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&amp;B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. ""I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,"" he stated.

&gt; In 2010 he said, ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it."" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

&gt; Before becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit ""Right Round"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track ""3D"". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&amp;B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: ""The Other Side"", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Airplanes"" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

&gt; He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.

&gt; On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims ""he has never used drugs before"" and his decision was ""foolish"".

&gt; He has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. Read more on Last.fm.

I meant Dom could have been a  sleeper or an illegal, but either way, he turned (as I cannot see an officer having a familiar relationship with a spy, but I could from a turned spy).  In fact, given that we have never heard anything from Dom's wife, she could have been the sleeper or illegal and Dom a cover.  She could have been caught or killed.  And thus make it credible that her daughter would be recruited.  I have a feeling that Katarina was masquerading as a KGB, but truly was an double agent from the very beginning.

Why? there have been some curious things about Katarina's activities and the way they refer to her. 

Red says of her (while always using her full name)  that Katarina Rostova was a KGB agent, but he also calls her a spymaster, a secret keeper.

Red makes references to Katarina as if they had run missions with her:  ""Katarina Rostova was the cleverest, most resourceful woman I have ever known. No matter how dark the moment, she could always find her way through."" In his hallucination in Cape May it would seem as if they did not need to speak to bring about a plan, while unarmed to defeat some 4-6 armed killers.  The relationship of Red with Dom further confirms this notion.

Connolly, under the direction of Peter Kotsiopolus, director of  clandestine services called her:  a Russian KGB asset.  It is obvious that Peter, a CIA high official in charge of clandestine operations knew Katarina, as he tells Liz she looks like her mother, while the CIA's OREA calls Katarina ""a myth. Tall tales late at night over vodka shots. Probably an amalgamation of a half-a-dozen unknown female Soviet operatives-- the Pinko Mata Hari.""

Right there one has a CIA official in charge of clandestine operation knowing Liz's mother, while the European and Russian section discounts her as a myth. basically an amalgamation of some unknown female operatives.  But we later learn she was an undercover agent, so I am thinking those unknown female operatives was her under different identities.

the plan to get an asset in the Post office (because Red had disposed of Diane Fowler and Berlin's guy killed the former CIA agent in there, Meera Malik) starts in 1.15 when the connection between Connolly and Cooper is highlighted.  by 1.21 the attack on Cooper, facilitated by agent Martin luring Cooper into the open with nobody except a driver hurts him enough to send him into the hospital where the ""brain tumor"" is discovered and the experimental drug is designed to simulate the tumor and keep Cooper compromised.

Then Peter sends Braxton to a level 6 intelligence node to find information about the fulcrum, and gives Braxton the story about the fire, the house and ""the girl"". So what could be learnt from US intelligence about that night? Obviously not Red, as Peter knows he was there, and where he is now. So it is Liz or Katarina.  Because after Braxton takes Liz in 2.10, Connolly is dispatched to stop the investigation that could send Liz into jail, because Peter needs her for her plan. 

the media calls her ""a notorious KGB spy""

Alexander Raskovich, FSB Chief Intelligence Agent for Washington, DC  smiles when he says her name:

LIZ: The Cabal framed me. Who better than the daughter of a KGB agent? 

ALEXANDER: Hmm. Katarina Rostova


While Velov, head of the Zarubin Group says of Red: ""For many years, while you were still with US Counterintelligence, I considered you the KGB's greatest enemy.  So I imagine that given who Vasily Zarubin was meant Velov was in charge of protecting illegals and hunting them if they turned.""

Red does say as you say: There were spies to run, making him a spymaster.

now Velov says about Katarina that he never knew her personally. Which would not be strange given the structure of the illegals.  But that the Justice department was taking: ""about her KGB contacts, where she lived, and about a child.""

the last part that makes me curious about Katarina is the choice of cover.  She marries Rostov as a cover. Liz is born in Moscow and named Masha.  Now for a KGB agent having a child in Moscow makes no sense whatsoever. She would had make sure that Liz was born in the US, creating the next generation sleeper or illegal.  Naming her Masha was also not a smart move for a real KGB agent. 

  Rostov cannot have been a Soviet (a wealthy businessman, and his changing his name to a western name after Katarina left him),  but the timing for Liz to be born in Moscow is perfect for the Perestroika and the joint ventures with non-soviet business.  Making sense of Rostov spending his time in Novosibirsk, and traveling back and forth, as Red suggests.

So what kind of cover could a man whose time was spent in the USSR provide? for a KGB wife in need of contacts? If he was in the Soviet union what parties, social circles etc could he provide to a soviet spy? basically the identity and nothing more.  But it seems Katarina was already brought up in the West, so I imagine she already had an identity that was acceptable.

Now if Katarina was truly a western agent (American, British, etc.), and had found a way to make the KGB recruit her, and train her, Konstantin Rostov, wealthy businessman of Russian origin was a perfect choice:  the joint venture would allow him and Katarina to travel back and forth and he could become an asset spying in the USSR.  Making Liz being born in Moscow a way to cement her KGB status, or a flunk by Liz being born earlier or because Konstantin was in the process of starting his joint venture and his wife accompanied him.

So Katarina would have had targets assigned to her by the KGB and her own targets for the CIA, or whatever agency she worked for.  She could have easily then stumble upon the cabal, by targeting intelligence officers.

This would make sense of Peter knowing her, if she was CIA  and he was her handler, but the rest of the CIA now having any idea she existed, to keep her cover intact, and if she targeted Red as a cover or as a source and Red turned her to work for him, it stand to reason Peter hates both of them, because it deprived him of an excellent asset in furthering his own career.

&gt;Ce s-a demonstrat la alegeri e ca o campanie bazată pe ""X e nasol"", cand tu esti cel putin la fel de nasol, si zero strategii pe termen lung pentru tara pe care vrei sa o conduci, o sa iti aduca o pierdere rușinoasa. 

Poate nu-mi amintesc eu bine, dar strategia PSD la alegeri s-a bazat exact pe ce spui tu. Că Ciolos e fiul lui soros. Că Nicușor Dan primește fonduri de la organizații obscure. Că johanis nu e Român, că nu e ortodox. Că opoziția vrea sa tăie pensiile. 

În plus de asta, care e startegia pe termen lung a PSD? Ca până acum tot din scandal în scandal o ținem. 

&gt;Numele lui Ciolos n-o fi fost pe buletinul de vot, dar a fost candidatul propus de doua partide ceea ce, pentru PNL, s-a dovedit a fi o strategie extrem de proasta, pentru ca i-a tras in jos ca o piatra de moara legată de gât. Chiar sper sa candideze Ciolos, sa rad de alea 2%, maxim, pe care o sa le ia.

Unde a fost propus Ciolos de două partide? Și ce legătură are Ciolos cu faptul că PNL e un partid fără viziune politica? Iar USR, a intrat în parlament după doar un an de activitate politică. Și fără nume cunoscute. 

&gt;Ți-e ti se par, probabil, aia ""10 lei"" o nimica toata, o pomana pentru fraierii de asistați social care au muncit 40 de ani si abia isi permit un trai semidecent. Pentru altii banii aia inseamna ceva, mai ales cand guvernele precedente (spune ca nu ai votat cu Basescu/Boc) au tăiat tot ce au putut, si tot nu s-a cunoscut nimic in urma lor. Nici macar minunatul Ciolos nu a adus nici un beneficiu nivelului de trai. Ba chiar voia sa mai taie, ca si asa o duc prea bine romanii. 

Nu mi se pare o nimica toată acei 10 lei. Dar vreau să văd că și se investește în tara aceasta. Vreau să văd că se lucra la autostrăzi, că se construiesc spitale, școli. Că se crește nivelul de educație al populației. Așa se pot ridica oamenii din noroi. Oamenii au nevoie de locuri de muncă bine plătite, pentru că în aparatul bugetar nu se poate angaja oricine. 

Ce folos că se cresc pensii când nu ai destui oameni care să cotizeze la fondul de pensii?

De fapt, ce zic, toți redditorii sunt IT-sti, cu salarii de mii de euro, isi permit sa se simtă superiori. 

Mie mi se pare și mai fascinantă lipsa de empatie a clasei politice. Pentru că în marea lor majoritate tot ce au arătat este că buzunarul lor e mai important decât cel al oamenilor de rând. Măcar cei din IT de care vă place să vă luați muncesc pentru banii lor.

&gt; The decision to built a new settlement in Emek Shilo, close to the Palestinian city of Ramallah, came less than a week after the UN criticised Israel for not taking any steps to halt construction on occupied Palestinian territory, as demanded by the UNSC in a resolution it passed in December.

&gt; Israel &amp;quot;Continues to destroy the prospects of peace&amp;quot;, said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, who also criticised the UN, European Union and United States for not doing enough to punish Israel for continuing to expand settlements in the West Bank.

&gt; The latest settlement in Emek Shilo comes weeks after Israel&amp;#039;s Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the Amona settler outpost because it was built on private Palestinian land.

For example, if there were just 10 countries in the world and no FTAs or other agreements then everyone had to pay tariffs to trade with the 9 other countries. When 3 of those countries then band together and form a customs union like the EU has the 7 other nations still have to pay tariffs to import to the customs union but because the 3 countries don't have trade barriers between them overall there is less tariffs. Same  works for FTAs, if two countries have one instead of paying each other for exporting the global tariff burden is reduced.

Is there a ""safe"" carcinogen? I'm operating under the presumption that glyphosate is cancerous. You could have an LD50 of a chemical that is really high, and ingest it and be okay........but if its carcinogenic, then you don't want to be exposed to it and especially not frequently. It's not safe to expose yourself to cancerous materials frequently. 

&gt;""Since you generally apply it twice per year, that means it's actually half that per application.""

You are making a huge assumption that people use pesticides like glyphosate biannually. People use it on perennial plants, on their grass, on their indoor potted plants, multiple times a week in spring and summer, and farming is global if you haven't noticed. Seasons aren't really a thing in Western developed countries. I can get a watermelon in December. People don't know shit about pesticide/herbicide usage or resistance and it's a real problem (not just with glyphosate). You really shouldn't stick your head in the sand here it could help you and your family to open your eyes up that these pesticides/herbicides are dangerous and many of them are cancerous or endocrine disuptors.

Appealing to ""authorities"" on the subject is not actually a valid method of argumentation, and I tend not to trust ""authorities"" considering that ""authorities"" constantly misunderstand chemicals and drugs to the point of widespread harm (Bisphenol-A, BPS, Atarazine &lt;--- all of which are currently on American markets + all the other industrial, chemical, pesticidal/herbicidal, and other approved compounds that have damaged people), overlook dangers due to whatever reason, or are outright bribed to approve certain products they know to be questionable (conspiracy theory nonsense of course)........Anyhow, you are referring to the European Food Safety Agency (squeaky clean record with them LOL) which stated really just based its assessment off the German study said that it is **""unlikely""** (what a debunking) to not be carcinogenic in 2013. Meanwhile [independent scientists](http://www.dw.com/en/independent-scientists-warn-over-monsanto-herbicide/a-18886833) that aren't working for the government or being lobbied by the company producing glyphosate criticized the EFSA study for unscientific practices and lack of transparency and a heavy public concern forced the hand of the EFSA **to request more raw data from Monsanto** and essentially show that this debate has not ended. That was in 2016. Various towns spraying RoundUp have seen spikes in birth defects and miscarriages and in 2016 glyphosate went on California's list of products known to cause cancer/birth defects.
 
If you have hundreds of scientists, multiple authorities saying ""Nope. This is cancerous"" in the past year, and you have hundreds of scientists and multiple government agencies or authorities saying ""Nope. It's not."" without actually addressing the concerns of the previous scientists with argumentation then **this is not debunked.** There is not nearly enough information to really determine 100% if it is or isn't, but I believe it is partially based on the incidences of spikes in cancer, birth defects, and abortions in the places it is sprayed heavily. Whether or not it is very dangerous based purely on consumption from foods is another story.

The UK is partially immune to such lobbying, as our politicians have a black-and-white mandate from the electorate; EU regional governments less-so.

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

First, your sample size of American authors is just too small--Donald Barthelme, Lydia Davis, or ""big book"" Pynchon all foreground their experimentalism, just to pull three names from the top of my head.

 Second, you should take into account how our relationship with Italian literature is mediated by what publishers think will and will not sell. So, the Jeffrey Eugenides of Italy, or whatever, may not be published in America because it's less exciting/exotic/interesting to the people buying rights for translations. 

Additionally, explicitly experimental art tends to depend on financial support from non-profits or state organizations.

Then we go to America for the first time, culturally similar, speaking a familiar language we all learned in school, but all of the sudden we understand everything *except* numbers. The weather forecast looks like you're going to be boiled alive, the distances sound like in some weird fairy tale or fantasy novel, and there aren't just a few units but dozens, often different kinds of multiples of each other and it's fucking confusing! Suddenly you don't know your own height or your own weight anymore, you don't know if a given distance is short or far, it's just some weird names and numbers, but not a bit of intuition to guide you. It's really a lose-lose situation: the units are harder to remember and work with, and you still have to calculate in your head, or simply go blank and nod, when somebody tells you how large/heavy/hot something is.

It's comparable to going to a country that decided to use roman numerals everywhere. I mean, to the locals it would be obvious that Arabic is just for fancy math and obviously an M is a much better (and shorter!) representation for a thousand than a one and a bunch of zeroes (I mean, we're people, not computers!

Warhammer was made by the people behind Games-Workshop in 1983, based on the popular roleplaying games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which they had been the publisher for in the UK. Games-Workshop had being producing miniatures for other roleplaying and wargames, both fantasy and historical before releasing Warhammer as their own IP.

The first edition of Warhammer, which would later be more popularly known as Warhammer Fantasy Battles, would have been used to sell minatures Games-Workshop had made by this point. These includes the historical range like the Holy Roman Empire troops, Crusaders and Arabians, the Monogols/Huns, the ""Orientals"" (mainly Samurai and Ninjas), the troops of the Russian Tsardom, D&amp;D alt miniatures, Runequest/Heroquests and more. The first edition of game used the world map as the basis of its world, and with emphasis put on the ""Europe"" and the ""Americas"", the eastern areas were left stereotypical. Nippon was the old name of Japan, as it is closer to how the Japanese would pronounce the name of their country, and Games-Workshop simply decided to use the old name instead of the new.

The game would continue to narrow its focus and phase out armies supported in the early editions. Despite that, references to the old materials remained, and the names of the nations of the Warhammer World gone through little chance over the years. This means the nations like Araby, Nippon, Cathy and such are all legacy materials left unchanged.",hamg,False,totalwar,True,0,

Asking random internet strangers carries the risk of your advice being what you paid for it, but in a situation like this anonymity is quite valuable!

&gt;how to settle down

can be a sticky wicket.  If you prefer to be ""normal"" and fit in with the culture around you, the choice is probably to be *intentionally* heterosexual.  Remember that your thoughts are to some extent involuntary - but your actions are all by choice.  To a large extent, **""you are what you do.""**  If you do things that tend toward ""normal heterosexuality"" then it will tend to influence your thoughts that this is how you ""are"" and how you ought to be.  If you make a point of suppressing thoughts you don't want to have, eventually that can turn into a habit as well.

Don't take this the wrong way, and I will try to not come across like an ass, okay?  If it doesn't apply where you live, then ignore the following but it applies for at least USA and most of Western Europe:  Your body chemistry can no-kidding be the only reason you have any confusion at all!  JUST because your body is changing, you can have new and unfamiliar emotions.  When you are young and your hormones (and the hormones of all your peers) are going crazy, it can seem like sexuality is **very important** but try to understand that this is only your hormones speaking.  In most of the western world, these years of your life are not the time for you to be selecting a spouse/life partner.  Maybe a few hundred years ago that would have been the case, and you should be making additional farm laborers with your husband by now but this is %CurrentYear% and we expect pubescent persons to be students.  These are the years when you should be studying and preparing for your own future success.  Allowing yourself to be snared into any sort of romantic relationship is **a distraction** from what ought to be your primary goal in life: education.  Thinking (worrying!) about what sort of intimate relationships you should have is not even properly a secondary concern.  For now, try to focus on your studies, and on being the kind of person your parents want you to be . . . *so that they will not give you hardship for your nonconformity!*  

When you have your education settled, after either high school or college are done, your hormones will be less wild also.   You will have a better idea of what you want out of **yourself** in the future, and what you will need to do to get it.

It depends on particular model and outlook you take, but just as it is possible to say that hybrid mixes all best features from MTB and road bike it is also possible to say that it takes only the worst :)

In general you should not feel shoehorned into particular bike type - that is backward way of thinking about it. Instead start from what kind of surface you expect to ride on (which dictates what width and thread tires should have and whether suspension fork makes any sense), how steep are the hills (which influences gears ratios and their number that you want), whether you will want to carry a lot of stuff (ability to mount racks), what is comfortable geometry for you and what extra features you want.

I personally tend to go for trekking bikes with some sporty spirit. [This is the one I currently have](http://www.cube.eu/en/products/trekking/travel/cube-travel-sl-black-grey-flashblue-2016/). I wanted low maintenance - hence belt drive and internal gear hub instead of chain with derallieurs. As I don't like to remember to always take something extra with me I've chosen dynamo hub lights instead of detachable models. It also has slick, wide tires which roll easily on paved ground and are very comfortable on rough city surfaces. Since I ride year round and in basically any weather - full fenders were a must.

Of course today we played a real-life FIFA match against Palace and he probably had 10 good looks and didn't connect, but it's been months since he's had a game like this. Last season aside, Costa has completely impressed me this season by reliably converting the majority of clear chances he gets, which some matches come only once or twice. 

There have been some matches where he fluffed a good chance or two, but not one where we spent like 80' in the opponent's third. 

I openly admit that I watch Everton play maybe 5-7 times a season and thus see Lukaku primarily through highlights, but I swear if he just became more comfortable on the ball and improved his first touch he would get swooped up by a CL team right away. 

As a guy who looks 35 but is I think still in his early 20s, it'd be great for him to continue improving and become a reliable performer against the big teams. I'm actually pulling for Everton to sneak in to a Europa spot this season (mainly because that would mean that probably United or Arsenal comically miss out on Europe), so if that happens it would be a huge opportunity for him to step up his profile. 

Will be interesting to watch regardless, as Lukaku is so gigantic that it'll never not be somewhat hilarious to watch him shove aside average-sized defenders like they're teenagers.

Edit: Thanks for the interest, here we go:

Yes I follow the Buffet / Graham philosophy for most of my portfolio but let's be honest, I'm a gambler. I live rather simply specifically so that I can use my money to make money.

1. I research the companies and stocks I am going to invest in or speculate on *obsessively.* I've been poor before and the first rule of making money is *don't lose money.* If you're in a high variance game and you're limiting your downward variance you're by default maximizing the upside.

2. My base portfolio goes into indexes and sector ETFs, I invest in sectors I believe in. How much depends on how much I believe in it. I personally see healthcare and health technology being both stable and aggressive - people are getting older and more frail especially in aging population nations and health is the whole point of life. Duh. We're never going to stop developing new health tech and pharma and healthcare itself, such as elder care, will always be growing as long as the population is, won't it? Like investing in the future. People get older, seek medical care and die. This is also why I invest in energy, weapons tech and things that will benefit from cheaper oil and global warming such as shipping companies that ship across the north where there used to be ice. Call me pessimistic but I invest in human nature and big big trends that are beyond immediate human ability to completely fuck up.

1. Now, here's the fun part: I'm always looking for a bargain or for value or for stock 'on sale' as you might say. So far, in this hunt, I have never been wrong. I've quadrupled and doubled my investments more than a couple of times on companies that I see are definitely undervalued. I'll explain my criteria for that in a second before I lament how, in 2008 when I didn't have the liquidity to invest, I begged and pleaded for my friends and family to invest in a little internet company you may have heard of called Google. I wanted my inheritance in Google. I wanted my family in Google. It was trading at around $200. Yeah. Those who listened made good and those who didn't... well let's say my inheritance didn't get multiplied, god *dammit*, Dad... Anyway, now he listens to me. So how did I know that google would be huge? Easy - it already was. Playing a dip, and a crash is just a huge dip, is not genius. Google was and remains the best and some say only way to find things online they're in control of an enormous amount of advertising I and everyone I knew was getting all our news, porn, entertainment and most of our shopping done from the internet and all our communications for sure. Hello. It was not mysterious at *all.* But to some the market is just a chart. I like those people when I am playing against them. 

So, my criteria for finding the diamond in the rough that makes a lot of money with a small investment is also pretty fundamental: 

1. **I look for a company that looks too good to be true.** I am looking for a low entry price with enormous growth potential. Say a company that figured out [how to make 18 year old aged Scotch in a month](https://thewhiskeywash.com/whiskey-styles/american-whiskey/rapid-aging-whiskey-technology-game-changer-gimmick/). *Yes* that's real and *no* I did not invest in it. Because... 

2. After I look for something too good to be true, **I try to convince myself that it is indeed too good to be true.** I'm optimistic by nature and so I have learned over a long period of learning to talk to myself that I really need to temper my optimism. Before I do any other investigation I look at all the hypothetical situations that could occur and their likelihood of occurring and if it seems that the low entry price is because of high risk or low potential growth then, boop, toss that idea in the rubbish bin right the fuck away and move on. There's *always* more low priced stocks promising huge gains. If you want to play them all the pink sheets are only a click away.

3. If I can't convince myself that the product / company concept combined with low entry point and high growth potential is too good to be true, I then investigate the company itself. Management, banking, history of similar products, competition, average lifespan of the companies the board has worked at before, all that good stuff. If anything at all is fishy it's deep six time. A lot of what I am trying to uncover here is the motivation of the company: Are they there *just* to make stock money or are they trying to make their money *and* develop real value? Motivation and dedication is incredibly important. 

4. So, now, the product looks good, the company looks sound, the management looks trustworthy and wise and the personnel all seem to be oriented toward commitment to their team and goals. Here's the rub:

5. As you can imagine there aren't a lot of companies that meet these criteria and the low stock price criteria, if the others are good, don't last long. Since companies like this are few and far between I need to talk to people who are smarter than me and ask them what they think of the product, the concept, etc. I am super lucky in that I have friends and family members with great big brains and diverse backgrounds. I am one of the very few people in my family over 30 without an advanced degree. MBAs, PhD's, MDs, JDs, etc. If they think the product is great and they can explain it to me in a way I can understand it and everything else checks out it's usually a buy for me. Their level of excitement is generally a big tell as well. So, now I'll tell you two stories.

Story 1 is about a little company called Cadence Pharmaceuticals, CADX, which was poised to enter the US drug market with a drug they were calling Ofirmev. I can't find the historical price info but if I remember correctly they were trading at $7 a share when I bought and I sold at $14, it was a public buy out. Why did I invest in Cadence? Well, what they were calling Ofirmev is better known as motherfucking Tylenol. 

Intravenously delivered, rebranded, and administered as first response pain relief in emergency rooms. THE most popular drug in ERs for this purpose in Europe. Not. Yet. In. The. USA. I couldn't figure a reason it wasn't, it baffled my mind, I later theorized it was because it would compete with the opiate / opioid manufacturers and they hold the FDA's balls in a vice like grip. I learned about the company, incidentally, at a coffee shop. I love this world sometimes. 

So I talked to the company's management and their researchers and my ER doctor friend and my surgeon friend and I said to myself, holy hell, there are just so many reasons this will spread into a big wide open market. I looked all the things they had to do to get approval and into the market place: an FDA approval for the drug itself. Wot. It's TYLENOL. **DING!** Then - and here was the gambling that I suppose kept the price low - they had to have their manufacturing facility and the delivery method and the delivery method's manufacturing facility inspected and approved. Much of the team had researched in Europe, doctors are international animals who are educated and practice across borders - I knew this wasn't going to be a big stumbling block especially with all the years of experience behind the drug and its manufacturing. I figured the off chance the FDA didn't approve the delivery manufacturing plant was worthwhile - especially because they get more than one chance at inspection and I call this a keeper - so I bought.

A couple years later my money was doubled. And I was disappointed. I wanted to ride that stock to the future. But, as they say, profit's profit.

&gt; Blue Swede was a Swedish pop/rock band from the early to mid-70s that succeeded with a few singles that covered other artists' material, played in a deliberately 'kitsch' and 'novelty' sound. The band was originally called ""Blåblus"" (Swedish for ""blue denim shirt"") and featured vocalist Björn Skifs of the band Slam Creepers singing the lead vocals. The band got their international break-through in 1974 with their cover of the 1969 B. J. Thomas ballad ""Hooked on a Feeling"" as adapted by British pop eccentric Jonathan King. Their ""Hooked on a Feeling"" was a commercial juggernaut, shooting all the way to the number one spot in the U.S. Hot 100 chart and gaining serious airplay worldwide.

&gt; The group additionally had a U.S. top 10 hit with ""Never My Love"", a cover of pop band The Association's tune. Also of note, the group recorded a 1975 medley that combined Tommy James and the Shondells' ""I'm Alive"" and Deep Purple's ""Hush"", which played better in Scandinavia than anywhere else and brought them to a bombastic arena rock sound more aggressive than their general style. Over the years, Björn Skifs has had a moderately successful solo career in Europe. ""Hooked on a Feeling"" has experienced many surges of popularity, happening more recently in 2014 as part of its inclusion in the film 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Read more on Last.fm.

If those ministers were allowed to make their speeches and leave they wouldn't have gotten that much attention and the speeches would also be visited by already Yes voters so there would be no big change.

You know what affects the brain more than just being fully developed... experience, training, knowledge... the lessons they learn by doing, making decisions, and accepting the consequences of those decisions.   

You know what the worst thing you can possibly do to someone's mental development... protect and isolate them so that they have little ingrained experience with responsibility and real consequences. Which is why you see so many absolutely clueless college kids... they've been over protected and never given the chance to actually internalize real life lessons as kids and teens, they've internalized a watered down sanitized skewed fantasy version that will hobble them for their entire life... because their ingrained experiences have little basis in adult reality... and those connections are vital to make as the kid develops and grows, once the brain stops developing, those connections are pretty much set. This is why a 15 year old kid, who has experienced hard life lessons, had the full weight of decisions and consequences laid on them by absentee parents, will be far more mature at 15 than those kids coddled and protected by helicopter parents will ever be at 30.  

To use ""the brains not fully formed until 25"" is a bullshit argument to discount, marginalize and further hamstring youth from fully engaging in life, finding their own truths, and challenging the status quo... in the misguided belief that this is for their own protection. It's not protecting them, it's castrating them to keep them docile and compliant, because most parents don't have the balls to actually deal with kids who can think for themselves.

Brains can handle a hell of a lot more than most kids are challenged with. Taught correctly, and they can do complex math before they reach their teens, handle a vast array of abstract ideas, drive a vehicle that could easily kill them or leave them crippled for life (at 15)... but they can't be trusted to decide whether they want to have sex with someone they're attracted to?  

 That's bullshit, it's not that the teens can't possibly  handle those decisions, the vast majority probably could (they do in a number of Scandinavian, and European countries) it's that their American parents don't want to deal with the situation, and have done everything they can to legislate away a situation they're too chickenshit to deal with personally...

Starting off with writing is a great way to firmly embed L1 intrusions into your speech, and they'll be very hard to get rid of once they're a habit. If you don't care about accent, then that isn't so important.

Pimsleur quality varies from language to language, and I can't vouch for the quality of their Hindi course, but when it's good it is really good for a starting point. You'll have fairly good pronunciation that you can refer to once you start with the written system, you can associate the letters with the sounds you already know, rather than interpreting them through your L1. You'll also have some sample grammatically correct sentences you can refer to once you start learning grammar rules. You can compare what following the rule would produce compared to a sentence you know is correct, to see if you have understood the rule properly. It's not necessary to do the full course, even 10 lessons is fine before you start reading.

I like FSI's material for Japanese, they also have something for Hindi, and it's available for free. It would be a good place to start when you've gone through a bit of Pimsleur. https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/Hindi/Fsi-HindiActiveIntroduction-StudentText.pdf

The motivations for this revolve around oil production, the petro dollar, war profiteering, and, to a much much lesser degree, the systematic elimination of Islamic theocracies.

There are good and bad sides to this war for the parties involved and it is only a part of a larger collection of strategic positioning in the Middle East including the establishment of Israel and the preservation of the Palestinian population as a foot-in-the-door capable of triggering disputes through mistreatment of Palestinians which Western countries can then use to justify invasions.

Counter-intuitively, USA support of Zionism and the choice to use European Jews as pawns stems from the anti-Jewish sentiment from the neo-Nazi dominated industries involved, which often misdirect outrage by using Jews as the public face of their activities in the media and politics. Since the use of fossil fuels has become untenable and the USA has a wealth of very real military threats preparing for a world war, Israel and the Jewish people are being thrown under the bus with the gradual release of information to the general public that Al Qaeda and ISIS are actively defending Israel's Northern border from Hezbollah (Hezbollah being an organization formed in response to the Israeli organized massacre and rape of hundreds in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for accepting Palestinian refugees, and not the terrorist organization you're told).

The Asia South region includes the modern-day nations of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan and is home to approximately 20% of the world’s population. The mighty mountain ranges of the Himalaya, Hindu Kush and Karakoram were formed here around 75 million years ago when the floating Indian tectonic plate smashed into southern Asia, giving birth to the world's tallest mountains peaks. These include Mount Everest, known to the Nepalese as “Sagarmatha.”
Pakistan

Ruled at various times by Persians, Greeks, Arabs and Turks, Pakistan is home to a diverse mix of cultures and ethnic groups. The Arab Empire called it “the Gate of Islam,” and the country remains primarily Muslim to this day. The Balochi, descended from the Persians who settled the area centuries ago, live in the southern half of Pakistan and along the coast. The Brahui, a Sunni Muslim tribe living in the same region, speak a Dravidian language related to languages found in the distant southern reaches of India, leaving historians to wonder how they got there. The Pashtun are a tribal society in the rugged border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and the Burusho, or Hunza, live in the foothills of the Hindu Kush and speak a unique language unrelated to any other. Legend says that they are descended from the soldiers of Alexander the Great, but scientific evidence shows that they are genetically linked to the European Romani, also known as “Gypsies.”

When India gained independence from Great Britain, the religious and ethnic differences between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan led to the region being partitioned into India, East Pakistan and West Pakistan. This division led to one of the largest single migrations in history, as 14 million people tried to cross borders according to their religious ties. Millions followed the Grand Trunk Road and Railway in the Kashmir region, and hundreds of thousands were killed in the violence that engulfed the area. Sectarian violence has subsided for the most part, but there are still tense border disagreements between India and Pakistan, particularly over the Kashmir region in the Karakoram foothills. After years of border disputes and war, East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh in 1971.

 **comment content**: Thanks. Though I'm European (so even Bernie is more centrist than left to me) I can perfectly understand the arguments Republican voters bring, although I don't agree with them. What however seems blisteringly retarded to me is a clown in the White House that * Walks out signing two executive order signings
* Dodges questions about his own National Security adviser having alleged ties to Russia and *then requesting immunity in trade for information*
* Refuses to shake Merkel's hand, offending Germany
* Present Merkel with a fake bill that has no realistic standing, again offending Germany
* Hate on the EU
* Think Putin is awesome and repeat that time after time after time
* Constantly mouth off fake facts, and if he is called out either say ""that's just the information we had"" or shoot down the critic as ""fake news""
* Call global warming a ""Chinese hoax"" despite even major oil companies warning him its real and action is desperately needed
* (Wants to) withdraw from the Paris accords
* Increase the amount of coal being burned at power plants

Man... just writing this list makes me realize I'm missing a ton of stuff and that America will take quite a few years before they have washed off the stain from Trump.

Marx is a hugely influential sociologist. Somehow he is always portrayed as the founder of communism, but a lot of what he wrote is still accepted by many people today. I think most people would agree with universal education for everyone, one of the points of the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels.

 you're throwing ad-hominems around while accusing me of not understanding fallacies? what a buffoon. :)

there is direct equivalence between the two:

 - arabs attack Israel and lose land

 - germans attack Poland and lose land

 - in both scenarios that aggressor is defeated and loses land

 - in both scenarios people lost their homes

 - in both scenarios settlements are built on that land

 - in one case the aggressor changes their way, while in the other they wage a 70 year terror campaign.

i'm pretty sure you wouldn't be as understanding if neo-nazi's were blowing up civilians throughout Europe in a bid to reclaim lost honour and the fatherland.. but somehow that rational flys out the window when it comes to israel and the arabs.

&gt; Blue Swede was a Swedish pop/rock band from the early to mid-70s that succeeded with a few singles that covered other artists' material, played in a deliberately 'kitsch' and 'novelty' sound. The band was originally called ""Blåblus"" (Swedish for ""blue denim shirt"") and featured vocalist Björn Skifs of the band Slam Creepers singing the lead vocals. The band got their international break-through in 1974 with their cover of the 1969 B. J. Thomas ballad ""Hooked on a Feeling"" as adapted by British pop eccentric Jonathan King. Their ""Hooked on a Feeling"" was a commercial juggernaut, shooting all the way to the number one spot in the U.S. Hot 100 chart and gaining serious airplay worldwide.

&gt; The group additionally had a U.S. top 10 hit with ""Never My Love"", a cover of pop band The Association's tune. Also of note, the group recorded a 1975 medley that combined Tommy James and the Shondells' ""I'm Alive"" and Deep Purple's ""Hush"", which played better in Scandinavia than anywhere else and brought them to a bombastic arena rock sound more aggressive than their general style. Over the years, Björn Skifs has had a moderately successful solo career in Europe. ""Hooked on a Feeling"" has experienced many surges of popularity, happening more recently in 2014 as part of its inclusion in the film 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Read more on Last.fm.

An example that comes to mind for me is the perception of Aboriginals in Canada. Some context if you're not Canadian or familiar with what has gone on: Aboriginal tribes were awarded land (reserves) as reparations for mistreatment by European settlers and the earliest Canadian governments. Generations of these people have grown up somewhat isolated from the rest of Canada, and mismanagement of these reserves has resulted in some very unfortunate societal problems for them, such as rampant FAS, cultural alcoholism, and public perception of these peoples as savages, when most of their cultural history within modern Canada can potentially be attributed to systematic mistreatment and cultural subjugation.

With that context in mind, when people reduce these people and their culture to a joke or to a costume for Halloween, it has the potential to perpetuate the perception of these people as savages, and in the case of using traditionally religious garb as a costume, it is disrespectful to the traditions of another culture.

So, I worry very little about whether or not someone will be offended, buy instead about whether or not my actions might influence larger societal issues and perceptions, which may be unfair, and in turn, possibly unethical. ",,False,gatekeeping,True,0,

&gt; Russia and the West are there as pawns of their Islamic allies. Putin and NATO aren’t protecting their influence because the influence goes entirely the other way. The West does not dictate anything to the Saudis nor does Russia get to tell Iran what to do. Instead the old empires are called in when the wannabe caliphates want a power with a big military machine to do their dirty work for them.

&gt;Russia and the West are obsessed with a factional struggle in the face of a civilizational struggle. Their failure to recognize the civilizational threat of the caliphate is the greatest threat to their future.

&gt;The Deep State's War on Ezra Cohen-Watnick

...

&gt;Now there's Ezra Watnick-Cohen. He showed up in the news recently when McMaster attempted to replace him with an establishment infiltrator. 

&gt;... Why would you not believe ""unnamed officials""?

&gt;But what we are seeing very obviously is some of the shape and texture of the war based on who is being targeted and why. While those doing the targeting are ""unnamed"", their targets are named. And that tells us also about those doing the targeting. Any enemy action reveals something about the enemy, his motives, his nature and his goals. That is how wars of this kind must be understood.

&gt;But Cohen-Watnick was spared when Trump personally intervened, reportedly after top White House aides Sphen Bannon and Jared Kushner stepped in. Cohen-Watnick still serves as senior director at the NSC.

First, you've only been there 6 months and you want to ask for 3 months of leave?  That sort of thing might fly when you're irreplaceable and have shown a track record of being very valuable to the company, but at your junior level there's no reason why they wouldn't say ""no"" and then effectively penalize you for it in terms of future bonuses/raises because they assume you're going to quit soon anyway.

If you mention the medical issues, then it would just make it clear that you'd never really be able to work there in the future anyway, so even if they granted you the leave they'd be looking for a reason to fire you or convince you to quit afterwards.

So realistically you're left with just flat-out quitting a job after being there for 6 months... which, especially for your first job out of college, looks quite bad to a prospective employer.  You'll not only have effectively zero experience, but every employer will assume you'll leave again.

So that said... I would highly suggest delaying the travel plans *at the very least* another 6 months, perhaps another 12-18 months if you really want to be safe about finding another job.  Or, alternatively, look for a job in another country in your field right now.  You can live somewhere else while working too.

I wouldn't worry too much about missing out on the opportunity to use London as a ""home base"", unless you're really set on traveling Western Europe, because you'd end up spending less money if you just traveled through somewhere cheap like SEA/S America without a ""home base"".",,False,solotravel,True,0,

I'm aware of the long-term effects of the Black Death vis-a-vis increasing the value of labour and the improvements that followed.

I suppose one way of wording it would be, how was the MENA affected by the 50 or 60 years or so, when it essentially seemed like the world was ending, and everyone was moping about painting things like this:

Senior Tories said there was “panic” from EU leaders about the impact the UK’s exit would have on security in the face of ""increased Russian aggression"".

Leaked minutes of a Brexit cabinet committee meeting on March 7 show ministers identified the UK’s “very strong hand” on defence as a key advantage in negotiations. 

Those present said security would be a “defining” issue for the EU and that Britain should not “underplay” its hand as it seeks to secure a favourable free trade deal. 

Michael Fallon, David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson are all understood to have spoken up about the importance of British security to the EU ahead of talks. 

A source familiar with the discussions said: “While there were nuances, I think the absolute view around the table was we are in a very strong position and the Europeans know it.

“We go into these negotiations with security and defence being a big thing in our corner.”

A Government source declined to comment on the leak but said that Britain wants “a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security”. 

The revelations undermine attempts by ministers to play down a furious row that erupted this week after the UK Government appeared to link security cooperation to a trade deal. 

Theresa May faced allegations of “blackmail” and “threats” by EU figures after her Article 50 Brexit letter mentioned security 11 times across six pages. 

“If ... we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms,” one part of the letter read. 

“In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.”

On the same day Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, suggested the UK could stop sharing information with Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency.

Number 10 insisted no “threat” was intended and that the UK Government was not explicitly linking the country’s help on security with a trade deal.

However The Sunday Telegraph has obtained an official account of a meeting of cabinet ministers last month which discussed how security could be used to full advantage in Brexit talks. 

It reveals that senior Government figures not only acknowledged EU leaders feared the impact of Brexit on security but expressed a willingness to use their position for leverage.

A paper on Britain’s defence and security drawn up by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office was submitted for discussion. 

It both spelled out the country’s existing EU security links and reported back what EU leaders were thinking on the topic – including rising concerns over Russian aggression. 

Mr Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, led discussions by saying that Britain had a “strong hand” at the negotiating table when it came to security. 

He stressed that “we should not be a demeanour” in negotiations when it came to security – the French word for someone who makes demands – but be aware of the tactical advantage. 

Mr Fallon, the Defence Secretary, is understood to have said: “Insecurity in Europe is at its highest since the Cold War. There is increased Russian aggression.” 

“The EU needs our capabilities,” he is recorded as adding before saying that the UK had “high cards” to play at the negotiating table on security. 

Mr Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is noted as saying: “I agree that Britain has high cards and a very strong hand [on security].”

“The UK is in a strong position and there is a degree of panic within Europe over defence policy and cooperation.” He is said to have added that the UK should not “underplay” its hand. 

Mr Hammond, the Chancellor, said that the EU would not offer an economic relationship which deterred Britain from co-operating on defence. He added the UK should make that “clear” during talks. 

Theresa May, the Prime Minister, also attended the meeting and summed up at the end. She is understood to have said that defence and security were a “defining issue for the EU” and that the UK is in a “strong position”. 

Those familiar with the talks said there was no mention of “threatening” the EU but an acceptance the UK could use its strong position during negotiations. 

A Government source said: “We do not comment on Cabinet Committee leaks, however we have been clear that we want a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security.

""Our position is simply a statement of fact - if we leave with no agreement in place, the arrangements we currently have will lapse.

Go ahead and ""call me out"" as much as you want. I was quite clear in indicating I couldn't tell what you meant. It is not beyond you to clarify and it is not my fault you didn't.

&gt; Since it's obvious we're talking about ISP and it's relevant infrastructure. Stop confusing people.

You're the one confusing people. You're confusing me by not bothering to explain what you mean.

&gt; Docsis is primarily covering what we traditionally call ""internet over TV lines"".

The protocol doesn't matter in the end. Are you intentionally using it as a distraction or is it unintentional?

&gt; DSL is a style of connection; which in turn often falls under the docsis protocol for segments of its' transmission 

No it doesn't. DSL doesn't use DOCSIS. DOCSIS is used for head-end broadband (the technical definition of broadband, with different up and down link frequencies) systems. DOCSIS (pre-3.1) even uses 6MHz (or 8MHz in Europe) channel assignments in order to be able to share infrastructure with standard cable TV. These are the (more) one-to-many connections that cable systems use. DSL is used for point-to-point systems like the (POTS-derived) phone companies use. DSL doesn't use 6Mhz channel assignments, it in fact doesn't have multiple channel assignments at all (other than 1 up and 1 down) because it doesn't have to be compatible with cable TV.

None of this really matters to the point under question which is what impact does that xfinitywifi traffic have on you. The answer is virtually none. To you it is functionally equivalent to traffic your neighbor is generating on their network. It's not charged to you, people on it can't access your network any more than your neighbor can. And while the system could overload, it's less likely to be due to the pittance of bandwidth (a few mbits) Comcast parcels out to xfinitywifi customers than it is to your neighbors who have 100mbps service.

Yes, you can have a system that is congested. Then you may have reason to complain. But it's more likely because Comcast signed up too many 100mbps customers in your neighborhood than because your house has an xfinitywifi access point that can serve 3 (or so) customers at 8mbit a piece.",,False,news,True,0,

So you want to jam as much in as possible, plus you're inexperienced, so you fuckin' overload x2. I made the same mistake on my first Europe trip. Though I only call it a mistake because I had no leeway, I met a French girl in Nice whom I liked quite a bit, and I basically hated the French up until I got out of Paris. That is to say, I disliked them via the Canadian French variety, still hate you fucking idiots by the way, and some idiotic displacement of mine from reading a lot of British history growing up. Though, I think a lot of Americans had a negative opinion of the French circa 2005. Freedom fries and whatnot. Paris was my first place in France, and I hated it. Still hate it, particularly Parisians, not the city itself you understand. Any who it was a real eye opener to the French and I wish I could've spent more than 4 days there, with her. I very much dig the passion from the French. It's not that I failed in the destinations every 4 days or so, I quite enjoyed the rougher pace I set. Nor is it that I felt fatigued or burned out until a month and a half in.

 **comment content**: there are lots of differences, but OP asked if europe could learn from the us (meaning: are there things it does better that are worthwhile doing at home).

since there are so many differences between places in europe (and in the US!), one could write a book in trying to answer this question properly. 

but we can start by assuming: is there something the us does that you cannot find in europe somewhere? if so, what does your friend think of the differences between Poland and say London, or Paris, or Milan, or Amsterdam?

the fact that ur friend is able to travel to the US tells me he is likely  university educated. in the US you have to fork out some $100k-$200k for a degree these days. i bet that is different. would you like to bring that culture back home?

By virtue of the UK's membership of the EU we are signatories to the [single market](https://fullfact.org/europe/what-single-market/) and accept free movement of peoples (along with the free movement of goods, capital and services). [It is critical that you understand this before reading on; the single market takes primacy in the hierarchy of EU immigration rules (see point 107).](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994TJ0115:EN:PDF#page-34)

In order for the UK's migratory laws to be fair and non-discriminatory whilst in the EU (namely the single market) it would need to apply freedom of movement to all global citizens (a *de facto* open border policy).

As an open border policy is not feasible, the UK is **obliged** to have one rule for EU citizens and another for non-EU citizens. For a country such as the UK, where the majority of it's immigration has historically come from Europe, West Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the West Indies, this discrimination has had, and is having, [racist effects (discrimination + institutional power/authority = racism, see final graph).](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31727333/immigration-numbers-how-many-are-coming-to-the-uk)

Now imagine how a 2nd generation non-EU immigrant feels knowing that the opportunity his/her parents took advantage of in the 60s may not be available for their equivalents today **because of the country they come from**. Perhaps if we paid more attention to the laws and less about rhetoric we'd have a better sense of who's on the right side of history in this debate.

Okay. Let's try that with something else:

1. Whether the social mechanism is so widely acknowledged as to have taken on consensus reality;  
2. Whether it would be possible or beneficial to change this consensus reality by mere argument;

Instead, the definers would prefer to focus attention on *who* did it and *why*, in a past far out of living memory. Academically interesting, to be sure, but so what?

Pros:

- Pretty as fuck.

- Chloe

- Shooting is a lot better.

- Villain is more interesting

- Puzzles are a tad more complex

- Them set pieces

- I really like it when games/films/series do the whole res media thing with flash backs.

- Great music.

- No longer is it the white guys killing all of the ethnics!

- No fucking jet ski!

- No QTEs that come out of nowhere.

- Way less of the whole 'how the fuck did the baddies get infront of me when I just unlocked the damn place?!'

- Stealth in regular combat areas was more interesting and viable.

Cons:

- Shooting still isn't all that wonderful

- Insta kill stealth and set piece sections.

- The climbing options weren't always clear.

- We seemed to have moved from America's 3rd greatest fear (hispanics and south east asians) to their 2nd greatest fear: Eastern Europeans. Plus, we still have an English bad guy! My prediction for the 3rd game is that it will be a middle Eastern villain with an English villain too!

- Shallow weapon variety

- Lots of opening doors and giving a lift to ai partners so they can kick down ladders that really serve no purpose but to slow down the game.

- Some enemies become supidly tank like at the end.

- Final boss fight is kinda weak.

- Puzzles still aren't all that interesting.

- Nathan kills sooooooo any people, even the villain pointed that out!

- The return of Blondie McFuckwit.

- Inconsistant jumping ability.

- Nathan didn't roll his fucking sleees down when he was in a fucking snowstorm!

- Riot shield enemies, nobody ever likes them so why do they keep putting them in?!

- Why isn't ammo auto-picked up? It is super annoying and serves no purpose having me have to press a button to pick it up and it only serves to further annoy when you accidently pick up a new weapon instead of ammo.

There’s nearly twice as many blacks in proportion to whites that are mentally retarded. You can’t just run from this information by just calling it racist. I’m providing actual evidence and all you’re doing is saying I’m wrong without even looking at the evidence or even trying to provide evidence against what I’m saying. You’re holding onto your views adamantly without even trying to listen to what I have to say. 

Why do you think it is that Hispanics and blacks do worse in school? You think it’s culture? Is culture the reason why there’s twice as many blacks that are mentally disabled? Nope it’s genetic.

The average Mexican is more intelligent than the average Nigerian yet Nigerian Americans outperform whites compared to Mexican americans. The reason for this is because we're selective for immigration overseas and we bring in high skilled intelligent immigrants. The average Mexican however performs poorly in academics. You haven't given any reason for why this is.

If you're going to deny human subspecies then you should also deny subspecies from various other animals like chimps, leopards and pumas since all of those have less genetic diversity than humans yet have subspecies. Chimps have 4. Leopards have 8. Pumas have 6.

To claim that race isn’t real is to deny evolution. 

You literally haven't provided a single source to any of your claims yet you don't bother to read any of the source I provide. 

You also haven't given any real explanation for why all races have the exact same level of intelligence.

Jews are about 1.4% of the US population and have the highest IQ's. They also earn the most. About 40% of US billionaires are Jewish. Asians also have higher IQ's and they earn more than whites as well. Do you actually think that the average black person is just as intelligent as the average Jew?

As I already mentioned before. Africans lack neanderthal dna. While Europeans and Asians have it. 

This is because Neanderthals did not exist in Africa and so the humans that left Africa ended up mating with them in Asia and Europe. That's not a pseudoscience.

Why do you think Africans are the exact same as Asians and Europeans if there's a biological explanation for why differences exist? 

Don't even bother to reply to me if you're not going to provide any sources because you are no worse than a bible thumper claiming that you're right without providing any real evidence for it. 

You're just being arrogant and shutting down anything I say by calling it pseudoscience without even bothering to give any real evidence of your own.

&gt; United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reassured his nervous European counterparts over Washington&amp;#039;s commitment to Nato and pressed them again to spend more on defence, triggering a rebuke from Germany.

&gt; Trump has criticised Nato as &amp;quot;Obsolete&amp;quot; and suggested Washington&amp;#039;s security guarantees for European allies could be conditional on them spending more on their own defence.

&gt; Nato head Jens Stoltenberg rejected Gabriel&amp;#039;s call to include non-military spending towards the goal, but said Germany was moving &amp;quot;In the right direction&amp;quot; with more military spending after years of cuts.

Just to put in perspective what the Fire have to compete with:

1. The Cubs: Defending World Series Champions after breaking an 108 year title drought, super young roster that is arguably the best in baseball, including arguably the best young player in the game and reigning NL MVP in Kris Bryant, they look poised to compete for a few more titles in the next few years.

2. The Blackhawks: 3 Stanley Cup Championships in the last 7 years, look poised to make another run this year. With a core that is lead by one of the best two way forwards in the league in Jonathan Toews and arguably the best American born player of all time in Patrick Kane, they look like they're gonna stay competitive for the near future.

3. The Bulls. Chicago is a basketball town, and the Bulls are mostly living off the nostalgia of Michael Jordan and their 6 titles in the 90s. Chicago loves basketball so much that the Bulls are still profitable despite being one of the worst run teams in the NBA.

4. The Bears: Fallen on hard times recently but have enough history and loyal fans to get them through until the FO figures out what the hell they're doing.

5. The White Sox: Not projected to be good at all, but have started rebuilding and currently have one of the best farm systems in baseball. In a few years they'll be ready to compete provided they don't horribly fuck this up.

Add in the fact that all these teams play in leagues that are considered the best in the world at their respective sports. Say what you want about the MLS, but they are still well behind the top leagues in Europe.

Most of that aligns with conservative ideals, from traditional families to free markets.

These ideals cannot be preserved if White progressives flood our nation with brown helots and footsoldiers in service of a cause to undermine everything we hold dear.

One need only look at Muslims in Europe and Blacks in America to realize that non-Whites are largely inassimilable into Western societies. Certainly, exceptions exist. A small number of intelligent, educated, non-Whites in America can and do assimilate, and are a credit to our societies. But the rank and file of non-White societies don't.

The natural question is: why? That's where we get into the fun stuff: inherent human inequality, racial realism, and sexual realism.

I've seen other bros say they would be fine with Blacks if they all acted like Tom Sowell. Fair enough, but we can't make every Black man into Tom Sowell. That's the whole point of the Alt Right: people from different human populations are innately different on all manner of traits. Other [Alt Right](http://www.counter-currents.com/2016/07/ethnonationalism-for-normies/) and Human Biodiversity sites discuss the matter further (It's a lot deeper and more fascinating than ""Race and IQ,"" though that is a part of it.)

The natural course of action, then, is for us to be with people like us. We will let other races separate and find their own paths, and all of us will be better off for it.

-----

&gt; and if you have considered alternative solutions.

If I can see Mestizo and Asian immigrants assimilating en masse, then I will give up the Alt Right and become a civic nationalist. Of course, this doesn't mean that Whites should commit demographic suicide.

The same point does not apply to Muslims, because it's irrelevant to the discussion. No matter where they go, be it Northern France or Eastern India, Muslims do not assimilate. They breed like rabbits and supplant whatever society they come across. In fact, India had to abolish *jus soli* immigration and is building a wall just to keep out Muslim illegals. If South Asian societies cannot assimilate South Asian Muslims, then what hope is there for Europeans to assimilate Arabs?

(An exception is America, which for the most part only receives secular, educated, and intelligent Muslims. But that does not reflect on the rank and file of Muslim societies.)

As for Blacks, five decades later, we can comprehensively say that the integration project has failed for everyone except the Talented Tenth. I don't see any non-Alt Right solutions here.

The core of the Alt Right is nationalism. You need to subscribe to an ethnically-based immigration policy to be one of us. You also need to subscribe to conservative ideals: in other words, Geert Wilders is not Alt Right. And you need to acknowledge human differences between the sexes, between populations, and *within* populations. Aside from that, you can believe whatever you want.

Same for the USSR itself, which was in many ways another example of a post-imperial transnational federation (although in other ways simply a successor empire).

In the case of Qadafi, I think the situation was more complex, although I don't know the history that well. It's true that Qadafi was some complicated type of Communist, which is probably why he pissed everyone off so much in the 80s. But post Cold War I think that insofar as he had a coherent ideology, it involved unifying post-colonial North Africa into an economic bloc that could try to get a seat at the grown ups' table. I don't think this was pleasing to the southern European countries (France, Spain, Italy) who still have quasi-colonial economic and military interests (and in Spain's case actual vestigial colonial territories) in North Africa. My read is that (a) France led the diplomatic push to turn the ""humanitarian"" mission in Libya into a regime change mission, basically because of the aforementioned quasi-colonial reasons; (b) Obama and HRC went along with it because with the EU in serial crisis mode they felt they couldn't afford to alienate the southwestern European powers. So in this case, I think it was actually pretty much the liberal internationalists who were the main anti-Qadafi faction.

All that said, I don't really buy the strong distinction between liberal internationalists and Cold War realist hawks. Especially in the modern era where ""Cold War realist hawk"" means ""anti Russia realist hawk"". Liberal internationalists can also be modelled as technocrats who lean on economic means to advance their own realist agendas.
