32,False,AskHistorians,,0,1465550568,"Carriers were used repeatedly, and effectively, by the Royal Navy and the US Navy in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres. However, you don't see any carrier-on-carrier engagements in either of those theatres, for the simple reason that neither the Germans nor the Italians completed an aircraft carrier. Additionally, the confined waters most of the actions in these theatres were fought in wasn't entirely conducive to the use of carriers. 

British carriers had a poor start to the war in the Atlantic. They were initially deployed as sub-hunters, a decision proved disastrously wrong by the sinking of HMS Courageous by U-29 on the 17th September 1939. HMS Ark Royal had a narrow escape three days earlier, taking near-misses from U-39. *Courageous*' sister ship *Glorious* would be sunk in April 1940 by the German battlecruisers *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau*. All they had to show for these two losses was a few aircraft kills, and a few merchants sunk. However, the Mediterranean Fleet's carriers would be a lot more successful in 1940. *Ark Royal* supported the British attack on the Vichy fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, with her aircraft incapacitating the battlecruiser *Dunkerque*. Carriers were repeatedly used to fly fighter aircraft to the besieged island of Malta, with *Argus* and *Ark Royal* participating in the first such operation at the start of August. Carriers were used to attack Italian airbases, as well as the ports of North Africa. *Ark Royal* participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, launching sorties against the Italian Fleet. However, the big success of British naval aviation in 1940 was the Raid on Taranto. Taranto was the major naval base in Southern Italy, home to much of the Italian fleet. Aircraft from HMS Illustrious (including part of *Eagle*'s air group) attacked the port during the night of the 11th-12th November. Three Italian battleships were sunk or heavily damaged, in return for two aircraft lost. However, just a couple of months later, *Illustrious* would be heavily damaged by German dive bombers while escorting a convoy to Malta.  

1941 saw the RN's carriers involved in two major surface actions. The first, in the Mediterranean, was the Battle of Cape Matapan. *Formidable*, supported the battleships and cruisers of the Mediterranean Fleet during this action, protecting them from air attacks. Her aircraft repeatedly attacked the Italian fleet, with one successfully torpedoing the Italian battleship *Vittorio Veneto*, while another hit the heavy cruiser *Pola*. The former would survive with heavy damage, while the latter was immobilised, and sunk in a nighttime surface action along with two of her sister ships. The second, in May, was the hunt for the *Bismarck*. The RN's carriers became involved after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, with *Bismarck* turning for home with the RN in hot pursuit. HMS Victorious' aircraft attacked her on the 24th, scoring one hit that caused only minor damage. Two days later, *Ark Royal*, following a sprint from Gibraltar, came into range. Her aircraft, following an accidental attack on HMS Sheffield, scored three hits. Two caused only minor damage, but the third jammed *Bismarck*'s rudder, allowing the RN's battleships to catch and sink her. 

Following these battles, the war began to calm down for carriers in Europe. The main usage in the Mediterranean was to support convoys to Malta, providing defence against air attack, and flying off fighters for the island. This was dangerous work, with both *Ark Royal* and *Eagle* being sunk by submarines, while *Indomptable* took heavy damage in an air attack. USS Wasp supported two of these operations, before being withdrawn to the Pacific. Carriers were also used to support amphibious operations, such as Torch and Husky. In Northern Europe, they were used for attacks against the Norwegian coastline, including attacks on the battleship *Tirpitz*.

Smaller escort carriers were also hugely important in the Battle of the Atlantic. These small, slow carriers, usually converted from merchant hulls, closed the 'air gap' in the mid-Atlantic (the area that couldn't be covered by land based aircraft from the US or UK). Aircraft could cover a much wider area than a surface ship, and respond much more quickly to sightings. They were also much more effective against surfaced submarines - submarines of this period tended to surface when not in battle, as they were faster on the surface, and it was more comfortable for the crew. Even if an aircraft didn't attack a submarine, it would force it to submerge, slowing it, and preventing it from reaching and attacking its target. Without the escort carriers, losses to submarines would have been much higher. ",t5_2ssp3,False,military,1462060936,t3_4h6p8c,t3_4h6p8c,0,32,d2nvm5a,20th Century Royal Navy,thefourthmaninaboat

6,False,AskHistorians,,0,1465550608,"While that is a very informative and detailed answer, one qualifier I'd add (that seems to be missing) is the timing of American aid.  Most of the aid was very heavily weighted towards the latter half of the war (1943+). That's understandable. It took time to ramp up wartime production and, obviously, there was a significant delay between goods rolling off the production lines in American factories and those goods reaching the front in Eastern Europe. Thus, very little of it made to front before the critical Battle of Moscow which ended Operation Barbarossa. It would be fair to say that for nearly a year, the Soviets faced the Nazis mostly on their own. And even as late as the Battle of Stalingrad, only about 20% of the total L-L goods had reached the Soviet Union (if my memory serves me right). 

I don't want to minimize the gargantuan effort that it took to drive the Nazi back, from the Volga to Berlin. And the American aid was critical to making that happen. But it is also true that the Soviets were able to halt and even push back against the Germans before the bulk of that aid had time to arrive.

""The two main induced earthquakes in Lancashire in 2011 were very small. To put them into context, they were less powerful than some of the earth tremors that have been associated with coal mining in the 1950s and 60s and that occur today""

And:

""There are two potential impacts on groundwater. The first is associated with the supply and consumption of water for fracking as groundwater may be considered as a source of this water. The second is contamination of groundwater. In both cases the regulations that apply to shale gas extraction will require a detailed risk assessment before any authorisation or permit is granted. Before granting a permit the relevant regulatory authority (e.g. the Environment Agency in England) will need to be satisfied that the activity will not cause pollution of groundwater or lead to unsustainable abstraction. Once approved, monitoring of the environment will be required as part of permit conditions to demonstrate that no impact is occurring. To provide an independent environmental baseline against which this compliance monitoring can be compared, the BGS is undertaking a baseline survey of methane concentrations in groundwater ahead of any shale gas development as there is currently no UK baseline. The baseline study is not only restricted to methane. A wider range of chemical indicator parameters are also being measured and the results will supplement the data already published by the BGS and used to set groundwater threshold values (standards) for the EU Water Framework Directive.

Understanding the risks is a very important step in the design and approval process and very strict controls and regulations are in place to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.""

LONG POST but please read; there are 3 questions in there in bold.

Here are a couple of fun facts about Iran:

- We have public universities and if you ~~pass~~ excel your entrance exam (called the Konkoor, which is a french word and is as hard as an SAT test), you can go to university for FREE!  Passing it won't do anything. It depends on the relative competition. It involves a lot of subjects, it doesn't matter whether you are an art major or a med major (no pre-med in iran), YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING FROM EVERY SUBJECT TAUGHT TO YOU EVER. 

- Unlike popular belief, our women drive and and attend university. [70% of STEM students in Iran are Women.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/amyguttman/2015/12/09/set-to-take-over-tech-70-of-irans-science-and-engineering-students-are-women/#176502665870) Our STEM field is probably the second strongest in the region (Israel is first). 

- One thing I like best is our ability to make our own technology under severe sanctions. Since 1979, Iran has been put under sanctions by the USA and the EU and plans to remove them for the first time was set for 2016. As a result, we have persevered and improved in our STEM fields to create domestic technologies to compensate for shortages.

**Question: How is education in your country?**


- Music and underground culture (fasten your seatbelts!):

I would like to say that Iranians have a huge underground music scene because the allowed music scene is limited to Males as lead singers and very generic songs. The Arian band is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKc8W6ncO20. Bonus, this exact same band sang a song with Chris De Burg and they wanted to do an album but the Ministry in Iran did not permit them. Here's the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGvLsUYhJ4. Of course, other types of music allowed are traditional, folk and poetry. 

Here's an example of Iranian folk music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92mVoinVUcg
 
The Iranians, since the revolution, love to imitate western cultures. As a result, there is a huge underground culture. Most of them are veiled and you must knock on a door to see what's inside. Metaphorically, of course. Usually, what happens behind closed doors is left alone. That's why when you come to an Iranian community on the internet, they like to stay anonymous. You would see 1980's fashion behind closed doors during the 1980's, for example. It's all veiled and is difficult to see especially with all the negative light the media is showing us to be. Many Iranians that become successful and gain fans from everywhere, leave the country and usually settle in L.A. where both the Iranian community is big and where their music industry is located.

Malmö have a horrible trackrecord against Häcken. They have lost twice in a row on homepitch and Häcken have won with a fantastic away odds. 

Add to that this time Malmö and Häcken will play eachother in the Swedish cup final 4 days later. 

None of the teams qualified to european cup plays this autumn last year so the winner will end up in Europa Leage qualification rounds. 

These two games and that dynamic added together that they will play eachother twice makes things abit more interesting.

0,1462065817,conspiracy,,1,1465551689,"My point is: there can be a city that has a place-name and it can be unrelated to an ethnological designation. ""Parisian"" = ""Of or pertaining to Paris, France"". Paris, Texas is named after Paris, France--but it's residents are not necessarily ""ethnically Parisian"".

Likewise with Germantown, Pennsylvania. Germantown is a city by Philadelphia. It's named after an ethnic designation [i.e., German]. But people from Germantown are not necessarily ""German"". You can, say, have an African-American living in Germantown and no one considers him ethnically German.

Likewise, in the Middle East. They used ""Scyth"" not as a particular people, but as a larger ethnic designation. Just like today, how we use ""Latin"" and it might refer to a dozen different countries. ""Latin"" isn't a national designator; it's an *ethnic* designator.

The Scyths were related to a lot of other Indo-European groups in the same region [like the Samartians, the Khazars, the Tocharians, to name just a few]. All were linked by a common culture and a common linguistic group [as well as shared DNA].

All of these groups had Haplogroups R1a and G [but principally R1a].

In the Middle East, all these different tribes were lazily called ""Scyths"".

The so-called Scythian tribes [i.e., Khazars, Samartians, Tocharians, et al] all held sway in Central Asia for tens of thousands of years. They pre-date Mongoloid groups in Central Asia and Siberia by millennia.

They're aboriginal to the plains of Central Asia.

Most of these groups disappeared into the ethno-genesis of the Slavs. Scyths, Khazars, Samartians, Ossetians, Alans all poured into Eastern Europe and bred with aboriginal Balkan groups creating Slavs.

Ashkenazic Jews were created in a second wave in late Antiquity. They poured into Eastern Europe from the corridors opened up by the Scyth invasions of Eastern Europe. It was the same corridor that other Iranid tribes used to enter the Balkans. The Croatians, for instance, derive from an Iranian tribe called the Hvrati. The Bulgarians also showed up in the second wave.

There's a maxim that's famous (and more or less accurate): ""Bulgarians are just Khazars who converted to Christianity instead of to Judaism"". 

Bulgarians have lots of the same ethnological traits we associate with Ashkenazic Jews in Eastern Europe. Not only did they show up at around the same time, but they have the same DNA haplogroups, and the same physical features--like dark curly hair, as one example.

See Bulgarian André the Giant, and check out his ""Jewfro"": http://www.nndb.com/people/580/000056412/andre-mug-sized.jpg

Eastern Europe got a ton of Iranid groups around this time-period. People who looked like this modern-day Iranian: http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000x0aljdOolMo/s/860/860/Arg-Karim-Khan-Shiraz-Iran-18.jpg

Or this one: http://www.tedmontgomery.com/remarks/12.7-12/ACLJ/Youcef.Nadarkhani.jpg

These features weren't isolated to Eastern European Jews: Most of the groups from the Iranian plain had these features. Ethnologists in fact refer to them as ""Armenoid features,"" after Armenians [who are in fact a related group. In DNA tests, Jews cluster closest to Armenians and Kurds]. So basically what we think of as Eastern European Jews are actually a hybrid group of Iranid tribes who mixed with Hurrian groups in the Caucus mountain region.",t5_2qh4r,False,,1462065046,t1_d2nxh5s,t3_4h6izp,0,0,d2nxzts,,Drooperdoo

16,1462065631,DebateAnarchism,,0,1465551736,"I made the point because the argument that *'people can't be vegan/vegetarian in the third world because its too expensive'* doesn't really make any sense and has no basis in reality. The choice to abstain from meat isn't really a choice in most of these situations, but the point I was making was that it is doable and the common situation for most in the world. 

&gt;In an anarchist future...do you think that the consumption of animal products would rise or decline?

I think it would probably decline. Mostly because of how wasteful it is in terms of labour and resources, and because meat production is wildly more destructive to the environment at large, and to most ecosystems. For instance beef production in California completely decimated and altered the landscape of the Central Valley and the Los Angeles area and is one of the leading causes for the massive draught occurring throughout the state. Meat consumption is really just environmentally unsustainable, the livestock industry produces nearly 20% of manmade greenhouse gasses. In some ways, the way we consume meat is also a product of colonialism, and the imposition of the beef diet found in Europe on the rest of the world. 

It doesn't really make sense to stick with a meat diet for many reasons besides ethical. I think how unsustainable it is would hamper anarchist futures and attempts at autonomy. Providing an unnecessary burden on the community and the land with which they reside. There are ways to eat meat sustainably, but that would require a complete reorganization and rethinking of how we produce meat, and at the very least a massive downsizing in terms of consumption. 

But really (sorry for the tangent), I think that part of what caused this massive environmental disaster that the world is facing and the disaster of meat production and way we treat animals, comes from the myth of Civilization. The line that we drew between ourselves and the ecosystem, that came from the idea that human beings become civilized by subordinating, enslaving, combatting, and defeating 'Nature'. This line of course doesn't exist, and if we stop putting the weight of 'progress' on this dynamic, than the mechanics which have created the problems we face will have lost their impetus and justification.

There are less animals for beef and livestock than there were when we had the great herds of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas - hence contributing less green houses gasses.

Agriculture clears land destroying wild life habitats, killing millions of animals and causing mass extinction. Beef can graze on open grass lands and savannah's.

Agriculture clearing destroys the soil, clearing via fire is the single biggest contributor to global warming from peat fires in Indonesia.

Agriculture in clearing land kills millions of animals, ploughing kills millions, seeding, insecticides then herbicides killing millions, then harvesting and finally clearing previous crops again kills millions each time - on each acre paddock.  

The fertilizer dependence  has destroyed soils around the world, while the run off has killed water ways and caused vast dead zones in oceans killing millions of animals.

Agriculture leaves the soil exposed causing massive carbon emissions and destroying the soil quality by being exposed to the air and sun.

The water requirements for agriculture are so vast that we have depleted aquifers and artesian basins around the world leading to UN warnings that the greatest threat, beyond even global warming is now water scarcity through this depletion.

Conversely beef restores nutrients to the soil, grazing compacts the grass, combined with urine and dung replenishes the soil causing carbon sequestration and preventing carbon emissions while also stopping soil degradation with a mulching effect and preventing it being exposed to the sun, erosion from wind and rain.

The negative effects of eating beef and processed meats come from the meta study which showed that processed meats contain phosphorous and nitrates from preservatives and from eating beef where the animals have fed on grass sprayed with herbicides - not the beef itself.

In fact it is now established that animals fats are good fats while vegetable fats are in fact the ones responsible for the disastrous rise in heart and vascular issues in modern society as we can not process these types of fats.

While preservatives, herbicides and pesticides which were found to be responsible for the rise in cancer rates amongst people eating meat - are found in much higher rates in vegetables. While those same chemicals are wiping out insect, bird, small mammal and fish  populations (run off) around the world in a devastating manner especially the bees.

So yeah - environmentally and for health reasons humans should eat exactly what we evolved to eat, the very substance which provided us our massive mental advantage, the very substance which provides us our energy advantage - cooked meat.

1,False,politics,,0,1465552330,"Uh, he criticized both Soros and Putin:

""The Guardian Hits Rock Bottom: 'Putin Is a Bigger Threat to Europe Than ISIS'
The Guardian gives George Soros a platform to spew his predictable bile""

or if you want the whole enchilada:

""The Guardian is really putting in the extra effort this week. Last Tuesday it declared that big, scary things would happen to Europe if Assad (with Russian air support) retakes Aleppo. Europe hasn't burst into flames (yet!), but things are still really, really bad: With help from the wise George Soros, our favorite ""liberal"" British rag is now proudly declaring that ISIS is sort of ""meh"", while Putin is a plague upon the civilized Earth.

Let's explore this treasure trove of cognitive dissonance together.

The leaders of the US and the EU are making a grievous error in thinking that president Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State. The evidence contradicts them. Putin’s aim is to foster the EU’s disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees.
Wow, Putin is truly a judo chess wizard. He somehow convinced the US and its allies -- probably through mind control, he knows how to do that kind of stuff -- to fund and arm terrorist groups to destabilize Syria. This, of course, would require Putin to intervene (after 3 years), flooding Europe with refugees fleeing from Russian child-seeking bombs. (Child-seeking is only kind of bomb Russia has in its arsenal, of course). Ergo, Europe will be destroyed and Russia will lose a huge economic partner -- it's brilliant! Or is it?

Putin is a gifted tactician, but not a strategic thinker. There is no reason to believe he intervened in Syria in order to aggravate the European refugee crisis.
What the heck, Soros. Didn't you just write the exact opposite? Make up your mind.


Indeed, his intervention was a strategic blunder because it embroiled him in a conflict with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, which has hurt the interests of both.
Uh, no. Turkey's president embroiled himself in a conflict with Russia -- you know, by shooting down a Russian jet? We've never heard this argument before, ever. Syria was a Russian blunder because it hurt Russia's relationship with Turkey? That's the big blunder?

But once Putin saw the opportunity to hasten the EU’s disintegration, he seized it. He has obfuscated his actions by talking of cooperating against a common enemy, Isis.
Here Soros confuses Russia with the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, among others. A common mistake/typo.

The most effective way Putin’s regime can avoid collapse is by causing the EU to collapse sooner. An EU that is coming apart at the seams will not be able to maintain the sanctions it imposed on Russia following its incursion into Ukraine. On the contrary, Putin will be able to gain considerable economic benefits from dividing Europe and exploiting the connections with commercial interests and anti-European parties that he has carefully cultivated.
Isn't this what psychologists call ""projecting""? When you're an insufferable douchebag, and then accuse someone else of douchebaggery to cover up for your own douche existence? The historical record is really very clear on this point: Since the fall of the Soviet Union, US and European ""strategists"" have been dreaming about carving up Russia and stealing its resources. Russia has never attempted to destabilize Europe -- Soros is just talking out of his cornhole.

Soros never actually juxtaposes ISIS with Russia -- because it's pretty clear which one is a terrorist organization that chops off heads and uses child sex slaves, and which is a normal country with normal people.

Anyway, golf clap for George Soros and the Guardian. Tremendous work, as always.""",t5_2cneq,False,,1462067500,t1_d2nulkd,t3_4h107m,0,1,d2nzcqo,,aperfectmentlegen2

I can't help but get the feeling, like other posters here, that this guy was knowing doing something wrong.  When I was making up lessons for Chinese, I included a lot of things like Grimm Fairy Tales, Aesop and my own Simple English write ups of key points of Western Philosophical thought and history as a way to shake up the students a bit and introduce them to outside thought.  None of it was something that government censors would have jumped on (if it was, Chinese wifey would have let me know).  To get called out on it, it would have to be something straight up political, like maybe in his 'European Cultural History' class discussing Adam Smith, but even that I don't know would bring the ban hammer.  I think the only way would be for him to flat out say, ""The CCP does X and that is wrong.  Let's discuss why it is wrong.""

The other way, would be if he was preaching.  Literally.  That is teaching Christianity and letting the students know that Jesus is Lord and Savior.  I have heard of teachers coming to China and doing that.  And that does bring the ban hammer very quickly.

&gt;All that mumbo jumbo about Europe being ""more progressive"" is pure crap.

It's more nuanced than that. It seems Europeans tend to be more open about their anti-immigrant or racist opinions but when it comes to legislation, those issues aren't major topics like they are in the US. So while many European countries might be more racist than the US, their laws might not show it . It's a complicated issue

&gt;but the simple truth is that many immigrants just don't even attempt to integrate. They refuse to speak English, don't respect American traditions, and don't even try making American friends. What's the point of coming here then??

Why can't there be heroes on both sides? Like you said, the galactic terrorists are being maipulated by the sith, so why can't a good person be coaxed to their side, not knowing the actual intentions of who they fight for?

&gt;Preserve Yoda's Reveal

Once again, why? He was built up to be a powerful jedi in the OT, what's the point of just giving him more hype rather then giving him a satisfying role in the prequels?

&gt;To do so, he must travel to a secret planet known only to Jedi Knights to study under the legendary Master Yoda, for an indeterminate length of time

&gt;Bring Back the Good Vs Evil Morality Tale | None of this clones Vs. droids shit

This is a good idea, but I'd argue that in the EU, and especially in the Clone Wares tv show, the clones are actual good people we care about (so if they just showed more of that in the movies it'd be a lot better) and in the OT the clones are basically as expendable as the droids in the prequels.

&gt;Obi-Wan doesn't leave Anakin to die, and we never see Anakin get in the Vader suit, preserving as much of the plot of the OT as possible.

Two problems with this: I think taking out Obi-Wan leaving Anakin to die would take out one of the best genuinely sad moments of the prequels. He knows he has to kill Anakin for what he's done, but he can't bring himself to do it so he leaves him there. I find no problems with leaving that in. Secondly, not seeing him in the vader suit would be fine if it's implied that these films came out before the OT, but as they wouldn't, I think that would also strip the movie of one of the most important scenes. Everyone whose seen the OT would want to see the vader transformation scene, and I'm sure there are far less people who are watching these movies without seeing the OT

People are pretty quick to take the words of politicians and turn it into official policy while being totally ignorant of the fact that their own country probably has its fair share of idiots who put their foot in their mouth when they talk.

Turkey's situation is mostly political. Relative to the salafist monarchies that European governments and America enjoy aiding(like Saudi Arabia), Turkish society is more on the liberal side. They have bars, they have clubs, they even have sex shops in some places. Prostitution is technically legal(albeit the AKP has ""neglected"" to approve new brothels and prostitutes so it's being killed off, but it's in the law).

Despite all the cries that Turkey is becoming Islamist, it's always forgotten that Turkey is a very nationalist country and quite used to their hybrid version of secularism that mixes with traditional values. If we rely on mere rhetoric, one could say a man like Trump is going to turn America into a xenophobic dictatorship. The reality? Even if Trump becomes President, he can't do shit without Congress.

The situation in Turkey may be worse than the previous years, but to assume that the Turkish population has just up and at em become hardcore Islamist is just hyperbole to the maximum.

0,1462079726,conspiracy,,1,1465554839,"Well, it places the ethnogenesis of Yiddish (improbably) in Turkey. Turkey isn't (and has never been a Slavic or Germanic linguistic zone). You know who *did* have Slavic languages, though? Eastern Europe--which is precisely where the Scyths and Khazars were.

It'd be like someone trying to study the origins of Italian, and rather than start with the Roman Empire in Italy, shifting the birthplace of the language over to Saudi Arabia.

Arabia never spoke Romance languages, and Turkey never spoke Slavic languages.

So it's more than a stretch to place the origins of Yiddish there.

Especially when you have the overwhelming balance of history, linguistics and DNA placing the origins in steppes of Central Asia (on the doorstep of Eastern Europe).

I think that the general premise of the article is sound, though: That Yiddish cropped up, and was spread along trade routes from Europe to Asia. But I think that Jewish merchants showed up in Anatolia long after Yiddish was already formed. Jews enjoyed a trading advantage when the Muslims conquered the Byzantine Empire and set up their new Ottoman Empire. Christians were banned. Likewise, Muslims were banned from Christian trade routes. Jews (as neither Christian nor Muslim) could slip between both zones with impunity--granting them a massive advantage in trade. This is how Jewish communities ended up gathering in the Ottoman Empire [with Salonaika becoming the world's first Jewish-majority city in the 19th Century]. But the point is: Yiddish existed *first*, THEN Jews showed up in Anatolia. He has the order of events backward.

* Footnote: Interestingly, Anatolia (though probably not the starting-place of Yiddish) *may* have been the starting-point of the Hebrews. In Antiquity, long before languages like Hittite or Luwian showed up in Anatolia, the peninsula was homeplace to Hurrian languages. Here's a quote from Wikipedia: ""Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians."" [Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia] The Hurrians were a group from the Caucus Mountains who came down into the Middle East and settled in Anatolia (and then later pressed farther down into what is now Israel). There's genetic and archaeological evidence that the ancient Hebrews were in fact Hurrians. See the Tikunani Prism as one example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikunani_Prism The Hurrians were the parent-group of modern Kurds and Armenians--the two groups that Jews cluster closest to in genetic studies. Basically, Anatolia had three levels in Antiquity: 1) The oldest, were Hurrian groups, 2) Then came Indo-European languages like Hittite, and 3) the last, were Semitic languages. Though the languages changed, the genetics show that the people largely didn't. You had the same population adopting new languages every few thousand years. So, though we've been trained to think of Hebrews as ""Semites,"" they're actually not. They're Anatolians--of Hurrian origin (who only later adopted a Semitic language). But they're not a true Semitic group [like, say, Bedouins in the Saudi peninsula are]. Hebrews would have clustered closer to Georgians in the Caucus Mountains than to Arabs in the Southern Middle East.

That said, while I completely agree that using cluster weapons in civilian areas is terrible, the cluster weapons ban referenced in the post is a bit of a sham, as most of the countries that signed it either don't have cluster weapons in the first place, don't have a military or military obligations that they'd be useful for, or fully intend to use American cluster bombs from American stockpiles in the event of a large conventional war (i.e. all of Western Europe).

Fair enough! I do wonder what the statistics are on our particular cluster bombs compared to similar situations where cluster bombs were not used... though I suspect whatever study is being done within the military (hopefully being done) wouldn't exactly be released to the general public! haha

4,1462120475,fireemblem,,0,1465555931,"hoo man. That really is a tough question. 

Honestly, I'd say Fates has the best soundtrack. Reasons why?

1. Broad and creative usage of Japanese and European instruments. (The Koto, bagpipes, harpsichord, etc.)

2. REALISTIC usage of instruments. I really liked this a lot. One of my main gripes with RD's soundtrack was that there were times like [in here (0:13)](https://youtu.be/Clr3H78LM1A?t=13s) where it just doesn't make sense. In real life, it would be impossible to have a flute play over an entire orchestra. You would have to have an army of them.

3. Most of the music isn't from a synthesizer. The music was actually recorded in a studio from a real life band (I think). Maybe it's just a REALLY good synth, but to me, Fates soundtrack sounds absolutely stellar as if 20-30 people sat down on a chair and played actual music, compared to RD where I can clearly hear that the music came from a computer.

I dunno why. It really does all come down to opinion but I just love the melodies of the newer songs. Many say that RD has the best soundtrack in the series but I really have to disagree. A lot of it just seems like loud, brassy, and flashy pieces of music. I feel that the newer games' music focused a lot more on being slower, intricate, and more intimate. The change in the main composer of the music of Fire Emblem was one of the things that the 3DS Fire Emblem games did RIGHT.",t5_2t0cn,False,sixth-Elise,1462084503,t1_d2o3n77,t3_4h76ov,0,4,d2o6uxb,,Gimli-chan

7,False,AskReddit,,1,1465556084,"I would dispute it simply because people think her temper flies fast like an SR-71, when in reality it is only proportionate to the crazy things her husband, Walt, does.  Let me give you an analogy.  As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.
So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.

I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield.
Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing.

Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast.
Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower.

Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes.

After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did.
A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed.

Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly, yet totally dismiss the importance of Skylar's feelings in the duration of Breaking Bad's tumultuous storyline. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.  And the same principle applies to the way we look at Skylar.

Hence, they should forever live with their parents for the rest of their life because even though they probably would buy food for themselves, why take the risk?

Either way, the point of such logic is that people shouldn't ever be responsible for themselves out of fear that there's always the risk that they might forget to do basic things to ensure their well-being, even though such risks are incredibly unlikely, they should always cede power to a higher authority to avoid making such risks.

Even if the systems that involve the EU are only slightly more democratic, out of sheer numbers alone the UK becomes a lot more democratic as being part of the EU means that the influence of the British voter is reduced eightfold.

10,False,SanJoseSharks,,0,1465556431,"This may go into a little more depth than you wanted but here we go.

So to first answer your base question: Tonight had nothing to do with the sharks. Tonight was the draft lottery which is comprised of the non-playoff teams. It determines the order of the first 14 picks in the first round. The actual draft will take place on June 24-25, after the playoffs are complete. 

How the draft works: Every year, the NHL holds a draft which allows all 30 teams to select players from all around the world. There are rules for who is eligible for the draft (must be 18-20 years old if they are from N. America; any age if from Europe). A bulk of the players selected come from the junior leagues such as the OHL, WHL, QMJHL, etc. The leagues you mentioned are professional (AHL, ECHL) and are comprised of players who are already owned by NHL franchises. The draft consists of 7 rounds with the draft order being determined by the final standings and by the results of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In general, the higher in the standings a team is, the lower they pick in the draft. For example, the Washington Capitals, who were number one in the standings, will pick low in every round. Teams who make deep playoff runs also select lower. The winner of the Cup will select 30th, the runner up 29th, and the losers of the 3rd round will pick 28th and 27th (the team with more points in the regular season selects 28th). Picks 1-26 are determined by regular season points of the remaining teams with the worst team picking 1st and the best team picking 26th. Every round has the same draft order except the first round which is where the draft lottery comes in.

The draft lottery: This determines who receives picks 1-3 in the first round. The 14 teams who missed the playoffs are eligible for the lottery. The teams with the least points in the regular season have the greatest chance of winning. Once the 3 teams have been selected for those picks, the remaining picks, once again, go in order by points in the regular season. 

Who owns the picks:  Each team gets 7 picks in the draft (one for each round). But as you eluded to, picks can be traded. For example, last summer the Sharks traded away their 1st round pick to the Boston Bruins for Martin Jones. Keep in mind, that this pick is still the Sharks' pick, but it is now owned by the Bruins. To clarify, its position in the draft is determined by how well the Sharks did this year, and not by how well the Bruins did this year. Currently the Bruins own 2 picks in the first round this year: their own, and the Sharks'. Because of how they did in the regular season, their pick will be 14th, and the other pick depends on how well the Sharks do (if the Sharks win the Cup, the pick will be 30th). 

The value of picks: Obviously the earlier the pick, the more valuable it is. However, there isn't a linear progression of value with picks. By this I mean there is a massive drop off in skill between the first and second round, and the second and third round. After that, there isn't too much difference between the skill level of players of the 4th round to the 7th round. Although it isn't unheard of, most big name players aren't selected outside of the first 3 rounds. For example, the following Sharks players were selected in the first round: Thornton, Marleau, Burns, Couture, Hertl, Zubrus; the following from the second round: Vlasic, Martin, Nieto, Spaling, Tierney. As you can see, most of our big name players were drafted in the early rounds. The big exception is Pavelski who was selected in the 7th round and beat all the odds to become one of the best players in the league. Other players like Jones and Ward went undrafted, and were eventually discovered and signed by NHL teams when they were good enough.

This covers the NHL draft in a nutshell. If you have any questions or need clarifications, ask.

Not to mention if you're relying on your plan it was 17 years ago since they got lucky late in the draft and no other team other than San Jose and Boston have contended without lottery picks that they picked in their core. Both did have lottery picks they got via trade.  

San Jose hasn't won a cup for one thing and they made two trades to acquire a 1C and a 1D. Good luck with that plan. Maybe 10 years from now you can contend if you manage to pull it off, the lottery has a better chance. Boston got lucky and signed Chara in 2006.

&gt; Collaboration between Cult of Luna and Julie Christmas.

&gt; Cult of Luna is an atmospheric sludge/progressive metal/post-hardcore band formed in 1998 in Umeå, Sweden by guitarist/vocalist Johannes Persson and vocalist Klas Rydberg. After some member hunting and rehearsals CoL had its first line-up consisting of: Klas Rydberg, Johannes Persson, Magnus Lindberg, Erik Olofsson and Fredrik Renstrom. After a short period of time, Fredrik had to leave due to some personal difficulties.
When practice started to pay off, CoL recorded a two-track demo in January 1999. After some more rehearsals, the band felt that to fully live out their dream of sound experimenting, an additional member was needed to handle the electronics. Since Magnus had both knowledge and equipment, he was an obvious choice. Given that Magnus had handled the drums earlier they needed a new drummer, who they found in the mutual friend Marco Hilden. A new bass player was also found, named Axel Stattin. Another mutual friend helped CoL release their first record. Tim Bertilsson, head of Trust No One Recordings released a 7"" split vinyl with his own band Switchblade.
Watching a concert at the Trastock Festival, year 2000, UK label Rage of Achilles got in contact with CoL. Pretty soon after that it was agreed that RoA was to release CoL's debut full-length album. Release date was September 14th 2001. In these days Hydra Head Records had also shown interest in CoL, and this co-operation resulted in a two-track 7"" colored vinyl on HHR, released March 24th 2002. These two songs were recorded at the same time as the self titled full-length on RoA. Immediately after the release of the first album, news of the band's mammoth sound worked its way into cult circles and the band received rave reviews. Discerning listeners instantly appreciated the bands unique approach, trading light and dark to create music that hit the heart and the head in equal measures.
After the success of the first album, Earache Records contacted CoL and wanted to sign a record deal. After some negotiations CoL finally signed the contract. Immediately after that CoL entered Tonteknik Recording studios, in July 2002, to record their second album The Beyond. After the recording session Andreas Johansson joined in on bass, due to the departure of Axel Stattin. The Beyond was released February 10th 2003, to critical acclaim. CoL proved that they were now ready to bring their soundscapes to a much wider audience. After the release of The Beyond, CoL toured Sweden with The Haunted and the UK with Isis. After this the line up changed, drummer Marco Hilden was replaced by Thomas Hedlund and an additional keyboard player, Anders Teglund, was added as a permanent fixture. Magnus took care of the percussion and additional guitar parts.
At this point touring became a lot more frequent. Late summer 2003 CoL ventured into Europe with US hardcore sensations Poison the Well, to amazing press reactions. In December the same year CoL returned to the UK for a tour with art noise merchants The Dillinger Escape Plan. The early part of 2004 was mostly dedicated to writing songs for their follow up to The Beyond. They found the time to play a few long awaited shows in Sweden and Finland, before entering Tonteknik Recording studios once again in April 2004.
The recording of Salvation was done in three different sessions, thus enabling the band to take some rest and think about possible changes that needed to be done. Finally, in late July 2004 the album was complete. Salvation was released October 4th 2004 in Europe and Oct 19th in the US. This album marked a new era in the history of CoL, both visually and sonically. At the same time as Salvation was hitting the stores, CoL embarked on a Europe/UK headline tour, which also included Scandinavian dates. This tour introduced a new member, Fredrik Kihlberg, who joined in on percussion and clean vocals.
2005 was perhaps the most interesting year so far in the history of CoL. It started with a six week European tour, partly with American hardcore act Bleeding Through and partly by their own. This tour also saw a change in the live line-up. As Thomas couldnt participate due to being busy playing with other bands, Magnus took over the live drumming. When the band came home they had the time to rest for about a month before departing to the US for the first tour over there. CoL supported the mighty Mastodon on the first leg of the tour, and headlined eight shows (supported by Breather Resist) on the latter part. The reception of the American audience was stunningly good for a first ever tour in the US. After the US-tour CoL did some Scandinavian and European festival shows before starting to work on the 4th full-length album Somewhere Along The Highway.
In November 2005 CoL began the recording of Somewhere Along The Highway. The first session was located to an old octagon barn ten minutes west of Umea. The vibe out there was perfect and seven days were spent there recording basic tracks. After some more sessions in the studio environment, Magnus mixed the last song in January 2006. Somewhere Along The Highway was released April 24th 2006 on Earache Records, followed by a European/UK headline tour.

Most of the rail companies require you to have a reservation now, sometimes more than 24 hours in advance, even if you have a pass. 

Just messing around, I'm not seeing any individual tickets for over $50, unless you're going REALLY far. An easy way to see if it's worth is to figure how many trains you're going to take. If you're thinking of staying for a month even, train every 2 or 3 days, that's 10 to 15 train rides. That's what, $500-750 max. A Eurail first class pass for a month alone is $1,000, plus any reservations you might need. Only real difference is first class.

Depending on how light you back, budget airlines might even be cheaper than a Eurail pass, or even individual trains in the long run. Plus, they're way way faster.

-1,False,worldnews,,0,1465556751,"&gt; If by this you mean resisting Israel's willingness to defend itself against Arab aggression in the 1960s and 1970s (i.e. Six Day War, Yom Kippur War, etc.), then I'm still not sure where you get this information.

Uhh, the Suez Canal War was absolutely a war of aggression.  Eisenhower forced the British, French and Israeli forces to pull back from recolonizing the Suez.  And 1967 and 1973 are somewhat debatable.  Technically Israel struck first in 1967, although there were troop movements on the borders of the Arab states.  In 1973, Israel started a blockade of Egypt along the Red Sea, and then Egypt attacked.  It is important to note though that Egypt started that war most likely not to actually destroy Israel, but to recapture the Sinai Peninsula (Remember Egypt's president was now Sadat not Nasser.) I won't defend the Arab states that attacked Israel, as they clearly used Israel as a scapegoat to hide the inequalities in their own societies, and they clearly didn't give a shit about the Palestinians.  You can look at how horribly the state of Jordan treated the Palestinian population early on.

&gt; The US has also repeatedly called on Palestinians to stop inciting to murder, something far worse than Israelis buying houses from Palestinians or the state in the West Bank and living in them (what you call ""settlement policy""), but has yet to apply real pressure to them.

For one, this is distracting from the main point.  Europeans coming and establishing a state in Palestine is very clearly colonial in nature.  Herzl even compared Zionism to colonialism, because colonialism had a positive connotation during his time: ""Philanthropic colonization is a failure. National colonization will succeed.""  Today the plurality of Israel's Jewish citizens are Mizrahim (Middle-Eastern descent) but that was not the case until the 1980's, after the Arab states started expelling their Jewish populations.  The Jews that first settled Palestine were white, and that is seriously important. This focus on settlements is a focus on the symptom of the problem, not the problem itself.

I agree with you on the PA.  Incredibly corrupt, incredibly undemocratic.  However, blaming the Palestinians on their corrupt ""leaders"" (they aren't really the real leaders) is victim blaming in many ways.  It is clear the PA cares more about staying in power than actually securing justice and peace for the Palestinian people.  

I think the main point I should try to pass to you is that most people in my community (Jewish) look at the conflict as an equal fight between two sides, both not all the time morally right, both not all the time morally wrong.  However I believe this view lacks actual nuance that it seems to imply.  Zionists have been forcibly expelling the Palestinians from their native land since the late-19th century, whether through economic or military means.  The founding of the Jewish state was fraught with violent extremism from revisionist Zionist militias like the Irgun (Menachem Begin's unit).  After Israel's founding in 1948, the state has continued to privilege its Jewish population over the Arabs that lived there, whether through housing development, economic aid, or movement rights.  It really isn't the ""Israeli-Palestinian conflict""; it's oppression vs. resistance.

you should start between mexico and south america, because you want to reach both regions with gold production as soon as possible. they're your backbone to colonize yourself.


additionally you want portugal and castile to colonize south america. it's very easy to get a maximum warscore against them with an ally like france, austria or GB. being catholic helps with unrests once you've conquered their provinces. 


north america should be mainly colonized by france and GB. i took france down last, because i used them as an ally to destroy the other colonizers. they will send 30-50 regiments for sure. prepare to fight their death stacks or have a superior navy. 


colonial independences are worst case scenarios, because provinces cost a huge amount of warscore. you'd be able to take like 7 or 8 provinces instead of 50. 


furthermore if you rush the gold provinces you need inflation reduction earlier within the ideas. i recommend an additional colonist as well. 


wars against europe after 1700 will be exhausting for you if you're a casual player like me. pause the game frequently, take your time to get a new overview and adapt to new situations. one thing you should never forget: even if you fight against 600 european regiments, they won't be able to send them all. they are limited to their cargo ships.",t5_2uqat,False,,1462090995,t3_4h4va4,t3_4h4va4,0,2,d2o8ott,,Lord_Nipplos

One way to reduce line theft / sabotage is to give ""circles"" to bidders who will lay fiber. Failure to meet a performance target will lead to forfeiture of the circle. 

Now, allow multiple ISPs to set up their equipment in the telephone exchange (""local loop unbundling""). So anyone can offer broadband but they don't fight for physical access. In fact they have to pay a fixed amount per year to the fibre layers in each circle to use their infrastructure (kind of like paying for a toll road). 

To be clear - I think wireline internet is really important because wireless internet in India has too many subscribers per tower to give good speeds. But we do need TRAI to step up to the plate and prioritise wire line Internet. There are a lot of good governance models across the world that India can use. What's interesting is that this will generate a LOT of jobs &amp; make Indian net users' lives better.

I can't really say. I've pieced together as much information as I could about why people are after me. Apparently, I'm responsible for the deaths of millions of people. They say I started a war, or will start a war, that will be one of the deadliest conflicts in human history.

It's insane. Preposterous. Yet, I can't help but wonder if life is truly taking me down such a path. I have attempted to pursue peaceful ambitions. Become a beloved painter and die peacefully in my sleep. But they're still coming after me. I write this from a hostel in Vienna, my latest attacker screaming in an alleyway. He'd been apprehended and took a cyanide pill to escape captivity. To leave this world due to suicide by cyanide is a coward's death. I am many things, or will become many things, but I am no coward. I would never end my life by such an unmanly way.

My bunkmate and I have spent the night drinking and laughing. Making merry in the streets of Vienna. I have tried everything to keep myself from becoming what I am supposed to become and it has destroyed me. Left me destitute and homeless. My attackers continue to torment me, a man trying desperately to stop from destroying Europe in as little as three decades.

But my last attacker gave me a moment of clarity. I am being attacked by people who don't know me. Who claim that I hate Judaism and that they fight in its name. I have never claimed to hold a hatred towards any particular group of people. Yet my attackers dog me at every turn of my life, attacking me with such hatred. And, to be completely honest, I also hate them.

I hate these attackers for destroying my life. For turning it into a living hell. I do not know what these men stand for. Judaism is the only clue I have, yet there must be more. In a time of uncertainty and doubt, there is one thing that is clear: living a peaceful life is clearly not the way to handle this madness. If I am to survive, I must go on the attack.

A black person would not be that shocking. But, if you told them you were from Africa, then they might be shocked in a good way. Authentic Africans in Europe were shocking, since most traveling routes were just too difficult.

Stories about mythical African kingdoms were common; [Prester John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prester_John) was probably the most popular


Marco Polo speaks on Africa:


&gt;Marco Polo had discussed Ethiopia as a magnificent Christian land[36] and Orthodox Christians had a legend that the nation would one day rise up and invade Arabia

African ambassadors:

&gt;Then in 1306, 30 Ethiopian ambassadors from Emperor Wedem Arad came to Europe, and Prester John was mentioned as the patriarch of their church in a record of their visit

The richest person in all of history, Mansa Munsu, was black and from Mali:

&gt;News of the Malian empire's city of wealth even traveled across the Mediterranean to southern Europe, where traders from Venice, Granada, and Genoa soon added Timbuktu to their maps for trading.

All of that was happening during the 1350s

In England in the 1350s, African were usually just called Africans. However, some were described as a ""blackamoor"", because they're doubly as dark as the moors. Although, Herodtus has already begun mapping the races some centuries earlier, he just used the general term ""Ethiopian"" to describe the people's of Africa below the Sahara.



 You'd be surprised at how eager people in the 14th century would be to meet a long-distant foreigner, especially one from Sub-Sahadan Africa. Africa back then was still a myth in the minds of many, filled with monsters, gold, and lost Christian kingdoms

&gt; Meanwhile India couldn't even begin border talks with a friendly neighbor like Bangladesh until recently.

India fucked up this issue badly with Bangladesh. There is no other way to say it.

&gt; And they are extremely generous! Only twice has China ever taken more than 50% of their original territorial claim.

 Besides India, China has [fought with Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War). Some of Chinese claims go back about 200 - 300 years or so, especially the ones with Tajikistan and Nepal. Tajikistan resolved the border dispute by [ceding land to China](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567), as did Pakistan. There are many countries who will refuse to do that. 

China considers the claimed territories to conceded as result of ""unequal treaties"" that they signed with Tsarist regimes, European and American powers. It refuses to acknowledge their validity, and insists that boundaries be renegotiated. If you were to apply that logic everywhere, Durand line would have to be renegotiated because the treaty was signed between the Afghani emir and the British, none of whom are around in South Asia. Pakistan asserts the validity of the Durand line even though it was the British who formalized the border, and not the Pakistanis. By the similar logic, Mexico should have a claim over Texas, even though it was annexed by United States way back in 1845, and Cuba should have a claim over Gitmo.

Indian dispute with China stems from the Chinese refusal to acknowledge the validity of McMahon line, which China states is no longer valid, as it was signed between the British and the Tibetians. Most countries, except China honour the international treaties signed by territories they acquire or control. This case by case refusal by China to acknowledge internationally signed treaties, and it's adamancy in asserting claims that are more than a century old, defies belief.",t5_2qh89,False,,1462098099,t1_d2o9r00,t3_4h7r4f,0,2,d2oacyr,,manoflogan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding#Legality

&gt; All nations that are signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture have agreed they are subject to the explicit prohibition on torture under any condition. This was affirmed by Saadi v. Italy in which the European Court of Human Rights, on 28 February 2008, upheld the absolute nature of the torture ban by ruling that international law permits no exceptions to it.

.

&gt; Bent Sørensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture has said:

&gt; It's a clear-cut case: Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture. It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) defines an act of torture. First, when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion, in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death. You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation. In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and/or mental suffering– one central element in the UNCAT's definition of torture. In addition the CIA's waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture, since it is 1) done intentionally, 2) for a specific purpose and 3) by a representative of a state– in this case the US.[215]

I'm a former 'pale princess' type, it really did fuck up how I view myself because people think super pale skin is weird when you're young and in school, so you cope with it by making yourself known as The Pale Kid(tm) because that's how people know you. That's why those people care so much about using Milk for foundation and white-out for bronzer. It's the thing that makes them feel unique and special.

Then they meet others like them, perhaps people who encourage and praise, even idealize having pale white skin, in these communities on the internet, so it's blown up even more. They consider it an important part of who they are. So when people point out subtle colorism in their words, or someone not NC-200 considers themself pale, they feel as if something has been stolen from them &amp; that someone's attacking who they personally are.

Idk, just some pseudo-psychological shit from my personal perspective. These pictures made me very upset because while I understand what they're saying, I don't get how they can be so oblivious. Pale Princess types are criticized for colorism, like I said, and this is *exactly* why. And the worst part is they feel offended over someone calling themself pale while simultaneously dismissing issues with white-european beauty standards that already prioritize pale skin in the makeup industry.

Everytime Japan is mentioned on reddit

&gt; There will be one or two people who show up and say that Japan has apologized for their actions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Japan has paid. Japan is making an effort to teach ww2 history. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it's true. The Japanese today are not the Japanese that did all those terrible things in the 1930s and 40s. It's true that the generation who committed all the atrocities is dying out. But so are their victims. 
&gt; 
&gt; My grandfather is long dead. He became an alcoholic after the war and passed in the 70s. Who knows whether it was related to the fact that the Japanese pumped his stomach up with water and jumped on his body because they could. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or maybe it was the way they rounded up all young Chinese males and executed them arbitrarily on the beaches of Changi. Maybe it was the rapes. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Japanese put Europeans in concentration camps and worked them to death? Cool. That's more than what Nanking got as well. Who knows if the ""comfort women"" were treated better. Is a life of a sex slave better than rotting away in unsanitary conditions? I don't know. I don't want to fucking know. 
&gt; 
&gt; All I know is this. Japanese war criminals are interned in the Yasukuni Shrine, and as long as the Shrine exists and continues to be visited by top politicians, sent offerings every year, the Japanese Government continues to disrespect everyone who suffered under their heinous crimes. I don't fucking care that there are other victims there, maybe even of previous wars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine the outcry if there was a German War cemetery with Goebbels, Himmler and Adolf himself interned alongside centuries of Prussian generals. 
&gt; 
&gt; So no. 
&gt; 
&gt; You're not fucking sorry Japan, and there's no defending your shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; P.s. Abe sent offerings to the shrine this month. This isn't ancient history. 
&gt; 
&gt; Edit: Just look at the comments right here it's disgusting. You wouldn't tell a Jew to get over the Holocaust, I dont understand how people can say things like this.

2,False,PNG,,0,1465558547,"PNG is often associated with cannibalism because some tribes used to practice cannibalism, and when I say used to I mean like over 100 years or so ago. Some of the first Europeans who discovered PNG fell victims to said tribes, and hence the cannibal reputation grew.
There is no cannibalism today. PNG was settled by the the Germans in the late 1800's and Uk settled on the lower hald in early 1900s. Australia captured the German occupied territory in the first World War, and basically ran the country up until 1975 when PNG got its independence.
Many people (myself included) think PNG got its Independence too soon and was not ready to govern itself. But over the last 50 - 70 years, PNG has basically gone from tribal life to a democratically led country. The capital city has most of the comforts you will find in any first world country. Good roads, five star hotels, TV, 4G internet, shopping centres, super markets, bars and clubs. The majority of these are insanely expensive due to the difficulties businesses face operating in PNG.
Unfortunately, the country went from a tribal life to attempted first world country in the space of one generation, therefore you are going to get some issues with such fast progression. The biggest issue in PNG in my opinion is crime. I cannot emphasise enough how bad the crime situation is in PNG. I ( a western male) live in Port Moresby and do not walk on the streets, nor do a drive at night without a security escort. Theft and violent crime is significantly high in Port Moresby, with many car jackings every week, as well as people (normally locals) beaten and murdered. The rate of sexual and physical violence against woman is huge (i think it is one in two or one in three PNG woman experience rape at some stage).
Violence is prevalent throughout the country but Port Moresby is the worst. A second major problem is corruption. The people in charge of running the country are extremely corrupt. Therefore, much of the money that should be dispersed throughout the country is often funnelled into leaders pockets.
Health and education are other significant issue. PNG is not going to get better unless it focuses on educating the next generation. Recent moves that all children receive an education are positive, however, the country doesn't have the resources to see it through. Kids have been turned away from class rooms because they are too crowded. Teachers often don't receive the salary because of the Government's money problems.
PNG's economy is also pretty bad. PNG has a lot of debt, much of it off the official books so it is hard to figure out just how much debt there is. PNG is wealthy in resources and it expected to receive a lot of income with new LNG projects, however, the recent falling commodity prices has severely impacted PNG's revenue. Despite the lower revenue PNG hasn't cut back on spending and so the debt grows. Due to its poor economy, PNG takes many bad loans with massive interest rates just to get by.
Although places like port moresby have first world luxuries, the majority of the country is still living village life. These people don't have jobs but mostly rely on cash crops. I think 7% of the country have a bank account (most do not have internet). Despite this, these villages are beautiful and the people who live in them are truely nice and giving people. The vast majority of the population are good people who unfortunately are constantly let down by those in power.

2,False,worldbuilding,,0,1465558549,"Not counting AIs and drones, the ""Executioners"" counter-terror task force based in Valencia probably consists of the most elite soldiers. Roughly one hundred men and women quartered above the VSS *Overwhelming Force*, their ranks are formed from veterans from across Western Europe. 

It is difficult to explain the significance of this task force without some history, so I'll be brief. The Commonwealth of Human Principalities (For the most part, Europe) had been divided in a civil war which was won by the rebels, who later absorbed the remnants of the loyalist army. These two sides were willing to cooperate in response to numerous outside threats, including the Hyperion Cult and Leviathan, an illuminati-type shadow government. Joined together as the ""Sovereignty of Ravengrad,"" they fought and won a war against Hyperion, but Leviathan still remained, and the Executioners were founded to eliminate it once and for all. To this end they recruit the best of the best from the Peregrine militia (rebels), Skywatch (loyalist special ops), and even ex-Hyperion Inquisitors offered amnesty in exchange for cooperation. Since everybody views Leviathan as a significant threat, former enemies work side by side in the Executioners. They have experience in modern combat and are familiar with Leviathan, and offer the best chance at eliminating this foe. 

Outside of humans, Joseonese Youkai* are probably the most effective single combatants. These are fully sentient AIs installed into combat chassis of a variety of specifications. They are extremely fast and agile bipeds, difficult for any human soldier to attack with any degree of accuracy, and any hits may well be deflected by a powerful High Velocity Impact barrier. The ""Oni"" type are armed with a broadsword in one hand and a shotgun in the other, though the latter may be replaced with an automatic rifle. The Tengu type are entirely melee-oriented, each arm ending in a blade for stabbing and a number of razor-filament flails that can be manipulated at lightning speeds to turn a target into mincemeat. 

These make up the bulk of the East Asian Endeavor's armed forces and substantially outclass the ""Mourner"" drones developed in the West and used by Leviathan and the Commonwealth/Peregrines, although the AIs inside are roughly equal in capability. Soldiers facing the Youkai often see no more than a rapid, white blur leaping from man to man and leaving behind pieces of corpses. In the few moments when they are still, they have a daemonic apperance - hunched, slender, and sharp, bristling with weapons.

3,False,europe,,0,1465558624,"""If handgun usage, for instance, is to be curtailed by the government after a democratic mandate then to violently resist it is completely against all of the republican principles on which America was founded.""

George Washington put down numerous rebellions after the revolutionary war by armed Americans, who felt that the democratic process had royally screwed them. Even after these rebellions he maintained the importance of the right to firearms because believe it or not, they are PART of the democratic process. Before you contrive this to mean something else, I will say that it is a means of last resort. After the Whiskey Rebellion for instance, the federal government and the Kentucky distillers came to an agreement. No problems since.

Also, you do understand that every law you follow is enforced eventually at some point by men with guns yes? If those laws suddenly threaten your way of life and no amount of legislation can stop it. You will do what exactly? Write angry letters?

""And if, as you say, the military wouldn't follow through with crushing a revolution, then you wouldn't need it anyway.""

The right to own guns is a contingency plan. It is written in our constitution that our nation is one of checks and balances. That includes a check on our own government, not just a check on government by the government. No, it means that if necessary this check on power can be done through force by the people if need be.

""Look at it this way - either the military remain loyal and powerful and they crush any opposition regardless, or they don't and the civilian population doesn't need the guns anyway.""

Look at it this way, you're completely, wrong. You've got it backwards, the reason the government doesn't even think about becoming tyrannical is because it knows how well armed the population is. You take guns away and suddenly that check on power is gone. When you lower the cost of enacting tyranny, you only make it more probable, maybe not today or tomorrow, but someday some group will say ""ok i think we can win, no guns after all"". Whereas before they wouldn't even think about it.

""In many European countries, including the UK, the military is loyal to the Queen rather than the government. In the event of something genuinely major - like a fascist regime taking power (not some far right lunatic's wet dream of 'THEYR TURKIN URR GUNS') - all it would take is for the monarch to take the drastic measure of ordering the army against the government and they'd be finished. ""

Well you see in America, the military is loyal to the American people. Not 1 person, not even the president. What happens if the Queen supports the fascist regime taking power? What then? Does that not bother you in the slightest? That 1 person has so much unquestioning influence? Why are you so comfortable with allowing a monopoly of force onto so few instead of one that's distributed?

European colonists could, and did, set up societies that pretended there had been no people there before at all. At establishment, those colonies were essentially extensions of Europe.

In other places, the indigenous population didn't die in the extreme mass quantities that they did in North America. Even after colonization, the vast majority of the people living there were the same ethnicities that had always lived there. 

All of the boundaries between colonies in both Africa and the Americas were political constructs designed to benefit the Europeans-still-living-in-Europe. That didn't matter so much in the Americas, where each colony was populated mostly by people from the same mother country, and the few remaining indigenous people were driven from their homelands or killed. But in the rest of the world, this was a huge deal. Cultures were cut into pieces by arbitrary dividing lines. Groups that had been in conflict since time immemorial were placed within the same colony because it was more convenient for Europe's ruling elite.

Racism was also a huge factor. While the North American colonies were backwater places full of weird religious nuts and criminals and other undesirables, they were still mostly full of white people, part of familiar cultural groups, related to the same people as their colonizers. This meant that the mother countries were more likely to invest in those places and treat them with at least some measure of respect.

And of course they can provide a good number of VBIED pilots to le Grand Sultan's army in case of a civil war. If anyone deserves praise about their contribution to the refugee crisis, it is Lebanon, a country with a population of 5 million that is a little bigger than Istanbul and is actively involved in the civil war, who took 1.5 million Syrians—many of whom are potential Islamic State sleeper cells.

&gt;More importantly, it also undermines the myth of the Islamic trojan horse, because if Turkey really wanted to flood Europe, then it wouldn't have called for safe zones, it would have gone All Out Merkel many years ago.

Actually it is a win-win situation for Turkey. The government would prefer to create a safe-zone in Syria to guarantee supply lines for the rebels.

&gt; Deine persönlichen Erfahrungswerte mögen sicher richtig sein und sind ein interessantes Beispiel, aber sie sind eben nicht repräsentativ. Mich würden daher repräsentativere Informationen interessieren. Sollte der Fachkräftemangel tatsächlich so gravierend sein, dann sollte es dafür ja genügend Studien/Berichte/Daten geben, die das recht deutlich belegen. Meist wird der Fachkräftemangel aber ohne jede Belege in den Raum gestellt und da frage ich gerne mal kritisch nach.

Welchen Hintergrund hast du denn um entscheiden zu können was repräsentativ ist und was nicht? Also bevor wir weiter diskutieren, was ich gerne tue, muss ich erst mal verstehen welchen Daten und Informationen du deine Meinung zu Grunde legst.

&gt; Also geht es doch um den Preis einer Fachkraft? Bestehende Unternehmen können sich die Fachkräfte ja anscheinend leisten.

Jein. Eigentlich kann sich jeder Bürger diesen Mangel anscheinend leisten denn die Kosten werden wenn möglich weitergegeben. Wenn nicht, dann lagert man aus. Software-Entwickler gibt es zum Beispiel in akzeptabler Qualität, günstigen Konditionen und in großen Mengen in den östlichen EU Mitgliedern (Near-Shoring) odernatürlich in Indien. Die steigende Ausbildungsqualität z.B. in China wird die generelle Tendenz noch beschleunigen.

&gt; Deutschland ist geprägt von hocheffizienter und profitabler Industrie.

Für 8 Millionen beschäftigte stimmt das. Ich wohne nun in einem Bundesland in der die Industrie überhaupt keine signifikante Rolle spielt (bzw. das Baugewerbe Medientechnisch gerade mal wieder spektakulär versagt). 
http://i.imgur.com/AGy0QzM.png

&gt; Aber eben nur auf kurze und nicht auf Lange Frist. Deswegen ist Einwanderung, um die Löhne gering zu halten ein sehr, sehr kurzsichtiges Handeln.

Absolut! Das kann nicht der Grund sein um Fachkräfte zu importieren.

&gt; Na zur Einwanderung gehören immer zwei. Der Einwanderer und das Gastland, das ihn aufnehmen möchte.

Ich verstehe nicht was du damit sagen willst. Ich möchte gerne Einwanderer aufnehmen. Nur weil ein paar verpeilte die AFD wählen und keinen blassen schimmer davon haben wovon sie reden, heisst das nicht das Deutschland keine Einwanderer aufnehmen möchte. Safet Babic kann da ein Lied von singen.

&gt; Natürlich findet man die. Ein iPhone zusammenbauen (es sei denn du redest von der Entwicklung) ist simple Handarbeit und Arbeitslose gibt es in Deutschland immer noch genug. Die einzige Frage ist, ob es vom Lohnniveau in Deutschland profitabel wäre. Aber das lässt sich nicht ändern, es sei denn wir senken das Deutsche Lohnniveau auf das chinesische Niveau ab.

Woher nimmst du die Information wie simple es ist eine manuelle Fakturstraße inkl. Arbeiter aufzubauen und profitabel zu Betreiben? Ist das deine Meinung oder hast du bereits in dem Bereich gearbeitet? 

Eine Argumentation von dir ist allerdings gänzlich falsch: Nur weil es Arbeitslose gibt, heisst es nicht das diese die Jobs erledigen können oder wollen. Sei es inhaltlich oder von der anzunehmenden Vergütung her. Ein Arbeitsloser der A gelernt hat, kann nicht Job B machen. Wenn er nicht will kannst du ihn nach unserer Gesetzlage auch nicht zwingen. Tendenziell hab ich das Gefühl du würdest letzteres in Betracht ziehen.

&gt; Darunter gibt es sicherlich einige, die ich auch nicht unbedingt gerne in Deutschland habe. Nur haben die eben (leider) die Deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft.

Also wenn wir schon dabei sind Gesetze zu ändern, dann wär das doch ein Ansatz: Keiner hat das Recht sich einer Nation zuzuschreiben, nur weil er in einer bestimmten Geolokation geboren worden ist.
Klar, will auch keiner. Für meinen Teil akzeptiere ich keine Sonderrechte für einen Menschen nur weil er innerhalb bestimmter Staatengrenzen geboren worden ist, dafür hat er nämlich nichts getan.


&gt; Die nachhaltigste Lösung wäre mMn Anreize fürs Kinderkriegen zu setzen und so eine stabile Geburtenrate (ca. 2,1-2,3 Kinder pro Frau) zu erreichen.

Ja also das mit Kindern ist nicht so eine einfache Mathematik. Zu erst mal ist da ein Mensch weiblichen Geschlechts der das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung und Entfaltung hat. Jeglicher Versuch ihr nahezulegen sie hätte mehr Kinder zu bekommen um das Abendland/Deutschland zu retten/das Demografieproblem anzugehen ist schlicht faschistische NSDAP/AFD Rhetorik.

In sofern wäre es aber richtig eine Infrastruktur zu schaffen die es angenehm und leicht macht sich selbst nach Wunsch zu entfalten und trotzdem Kinder zu bekommen. Hier gibt es viele, ganz einfach umzusetzende Wege. Derzeit fällt es aber ja noch jedem Bundesland schwer, der Eltern Recht für einen KiTa platz in Zahl und Qualität umzusetzen. Und die Kosten für einen KiTa Platz sind auch noch viel zu hoch.

Good. That's the point. If I can come across as this hostile to you, then you understand what it means for the people that you're so quick to be hostile to for the crime of wanting to live in a country as developed and as desirable as the UK.Do I think we should have open borders? No. Do I think we should have an actual debate, nationally, in immigration? Absolutely. Do I think the current attitude, especially from Brexiters, is helping that debate? Fuck no.  Now, as for your arguments:
  
&gt;That's the point I made about the engineers from the EU.
  
Yes you did. That isn't the point I was attacking, however. The overarching presumption when it comes to Brexiters and immigration is, to quote you:

&gt;If we leave the EU, we can put into place rules that restrict immigration from EU countries, such that we only accept people who will be of a net benefit
  
Except the ONS proves that to be bullshit. If that logic were the case, then we would have far, far less immigration from non-EU countries than from EU countries, and time and again the ONS reports this to be false. There's no possible way that every single person approved entry into the country on a visa is skilled or a student. The problem here is not that going for Brexit has the potential to lower unskilled immigration, the problem is that there's no evidence that it actually will because we literally have another set of immigration criteria to compare the far far easier EU migrant criteria to, and EU migrants are consistently either matched or outnumbered by those taking the harder route.
  
Oh, fun fact, Tier 3 does still exist, but now it's got a name change and it's meant to be temporary, but can you seriously see the Home Office doing twice the paperwork given that just a year or so ago it couldn't even keep up with Passport applications from UK citizens?

Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. **If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.**

The same is very much true for an engineer telling me how to run an economy, why pretend to know a lot about a topic you do not have an academic background in? The issues are enormously complex, just on EU border control I have a good few hundred pages on my desk. I'm not even going to pretend I fully understand the topic, but I certainly have a better understanding of the topic than someone who studied a completely different field. That's not me downgrading the importance of engineers btw, but I think arguments would be much more conducive if people kept their arguments about topics to areas which they are actually qualified in.

As for politicians telling me that it's for the good of the people, well yes and no.

Communism is often seen as super far-left so thus it's their antithesis.

Any plans to get a steady income?

Do you know how to fish?  Sail? Grow food?

Survival skills are not at all what you need. You aren't surviving but rather homesteading.

You won't benefit from knowing how to make a fire with a firestarter. Getting a fire to light up here is an afterthought. You won't need to know how to build a shelter, you need to know how to build a hut. You don't need to know how to build snares (there aren't any large animals anyway), you need to know how to grow crops and how to throw out nets.

Maybe learn how to dive and find out how you can send exotic fish to Europe and the US. In fact, you have to create connections with exotic animal dealers and shipping services. Then just pay someone locally to dive for the specific fish. I wouldn't recommend any other illegal activity to get some hands on money. No drug dealing/growing.

2,False,AskBernieSupporters,,0,1465559693,"It's a long video, but I'll watch for a bit:

Starting at 6:30 for those who want to tag along...

7:30 - putting American security and interests above all else is what got us here in the first place... Strict policies of interventionism and over reliance of foreign oil (instead of developing alternative sources of fuelling our cars) has caused us to try and control countries either ideologically or politically. The fact that we never considered the unintended consequences of those actions (like the coup in Iran) is where the issue stems from.

8:05- while undoubtedly our role in WW2 was inarguably good, it's not all rainbows and unicorns. The splitting of Europe based on ideological lines, and the first use of the nuclear weapon were unquestionably representative of a dark time ahead. Whether or not it could have been avoided is dubious.

8:20 - You can look st the cold war an say its a victory, but was it worth it? The fall of the USSR was an economic one, only slightly accelerated by militarization. China in the other hand adapted and integrated free market economics into its system. With arguably better results. Of course its arguable as to whether a different approach to foreign policy could have changed this. The Berlin Wall is a symbol of both the USSR's inherit instability and of the authoritarian form of government we faced. A military solution would have ruined us all however. 

9:15 -Sure I agree that its a mess but how is it worse that what we did in Vietnam or Iran ? The muddle eastern blunders were largely caused by our interventionism of the past (hell we even trained Al-Qaida). I agree that our policies were awful, but the issues hadn't just started then. These are long standing issues to which we've only developed one response to,

9:40- well not even, Iran had perfectly legal democratic elections, we just didn't like their choice. I don't quite know what he means by western though (non communist ?). Afterwards, yes tearing down dictators however it suits you doesn't work unless the people are engaged as well...

10:00 wasted, such a good point

1:30 What do you mean ""no vision""? It sounds like either a) you think that the middle eastern problem has a one size fits all solution, b) that trying to encourage stability favorable to American interests has not been our main goal, and c) the entire history of how the middle east came to be in such a situation. In any case Donald, you have a lot to live up to with such bold claims.

10:40 - Over extended resources, yes! ... wait what are you in about? Our Military has been weakened ? By killing the economy? See these are the sorts of lines that make you think that Trump has no idea what he's on about. Firstly how is a stronger US military going to solve anything? Are we planning to invade Iraq or Syria? As for the economy, Umm... is he talking about Obama or Bush ? The stimulus package spared us from the worse of the recession (unlike in Europe, where their austerity measures still means that they haven't completely recovered). The debt isn't an issue, the debt as a percentage of GDP is, and we've recovered from these sorts of levels before (WW2). Growth is high in the US compared to Europe due to their austerity measures. As for the trade deficit, we have no idea whether it is overall harmful to us. Why? Because we are large enough that investments recoup a lot of the damages. If the deficit was harmful, the dollar would be weak as fuck. ""ending the theft of American jobs"" such beautiful political rhetorical nonsense. The main killer of manufacturing jobs is automation. And for the few labor intensive manufacturing jobs that exist, we will never be able to compete en mass (unless you want to bring sweatshops back to the US ?)

11:20 - what ? Financial independence? Rebuild our military? Christ, I hope that we don't get a financial crisis under this guy...

11:25 you sound like Al Gore... I'm super serial.... (Ps that was a sad round of applause, I dont think everybody was convinced)

11:40- yeah, fair enough. The US is doing way to much. (wait now he's talking about all we've spent building up our defense, what?). But yeah global defense is important.

13:10- wait, which of our allies hates Obama? Also, Iran won't be allowed to have a WMD, our agreement with Iran is not based on trust, the UN will come and check and it helps us reduce the tendions in the region. This is how diplomacy works. Now the alternative was war, maybe not tomorrow, or in the next few years, but eventually Iran would have worsened to the point of war if it wasn't able to trade. What, were you expecting Iran to be civil ? I mean we've been so nice to them right? What exactly would you have done Donald, start a war? Also the deal was almost dropped multiple times. 

15:10- Israel isn't perfect, stop sucking Mets dick, a lot of it's counter attacks on the extreme side of self defense. Stop with the GOO rhetoric that everything is so easy. Also how would you have handled the Arab spring ? As for missile defense, look at things un context please? I mean I thought you wanted to work with Russia?

16:20- Our rivals no longer respect  us... you mean fear us ? I think we've created enough enemies, what's wrong with trying to broker sustainable peace? Christ Trump, that was an unbelievably petty example... so no peace with Cuba or any chance of seeing human rights improvements under you....

17:15 the Olympics are part of your foreign strategy? Really...

17:30- nobody anywhere cares about such insignificant matters as air force one greeting procedures. You know what actually was humiliating? The Iraq war, and the following rise of ISIS. 

17:45- NK is a terrible situation, China has lost control over its puppet, and doesn't want to see it fall and deal with the extreme poverty. But if you really want to invade go ahead. Also threatening China with a global recession/trade war ain't a great idea. And again, what would you do exactly? Threaten war? Fuck off.

18:50- yes Obama hates America, anything else new?

19:10- that's because foreign policy is hard. Do I agree with Obama's interventions? No, but they are just a continuation of Bush's. At least Obama has tried to mend some of our relations. 

20:30- oh god... really you need to say radical  Islam? That's the solution? Christ it was so simple, why didn't we think of it before?

20:50- Benghazi... read the declassified report on it and we'll talk

21:50- yay, bomb the shit out of everything!

22:50- Donald Trump, the man who despite having little to no support from either party, will still be able to get the most bipartisan Congress to reunite. I almost want to cry...

23:30- oh wait here's the part where he fixes everything! Never mind... it's all empty rhetoric. How the fuck do you stop the spread of radical islam with possible military intervention? That's exactly what caused it! work with our allies? Who the Saudis, who are bombing the shit out of civilians in Yemen? Definitely not trying to get Iran out of it's isolation will with great. Maybe we should just become allies with Assad while we are at it.... seriously WTF. 

24:50: importing extremism... lol. Dude you have no idea what the refugee processing is like,

25:40 9\11... Al-Qaida Saudis, so people from one of out ""allies""

26:00- they are already shrinking. Also Isis doesn't know our entire military strategy.... also quickly removing ISIS creates a power vacuum that another terror group will fill. The current arming of rebels works better. 

26:50- how much more bloated do you want out military to be? And we are still the worlds first  economic superpower.

27:00 oh no, we can only destroy the world once rather than 4 or 5 times over... disarmament was a terrible idea. How about we tell Russia to re arm as well? 

27:15 that's because we have high tech, low human cost military. It's much more effective. It also doesn't count security contractors 

28:00 you Fucking nutter, global warming is much more serious than a losing Islamic movement. We already should have acted in it 25 years ago. 

28:15 we already own the best equipment of all time, we make it. We have the most powerful military ever. But thanks for saying that you'll spend our bloated military budget wisely...

28:50- that's because nobody cares about the debt, well except for you. 

29:00- HOW ??? By bringing back sweatshops? Anyways we are the financial powerhouse because of those trade deals! We stop those deals and you will see a global recession. 

29:40- Oh... 3D printing, AI, cyberwarfare... Where are the jobs in your package ? Because all of those are high education tech jobs, a sector where we already dominate. 

29:50- the va needs support, I agree. We do treat veterans like shit,

30:50-WE HAVENT LOST SIGHT OF OUR INTERESTS

1,1462141529,HistoryofIdeas,,0,1465559937,"&gt; Neo-energetics, the conviction that there exists a literal identity between the physical concept of energy and the economic concept of value (leaving aside whether it is qualified as “available” energy), has a long and illustrious history, dating back to the 1860s. Moreover, neo-energetics has not been confined to obscurity, but has always enjoyed a certain visibility within the scientific community. It has encompassed in its rank Nobel Laureates and holders of chairs at major research institutions. More significantly, the tradition has maintained itself for well over a century, but curiously enough, it has also remained congenitally peripatetic, never remaining within the boundaries of any particular academic discipline for more than a generation. It has displayed a tenacity that has proven capable of fending off empirical and theoretical criticisms with aplomb and therefore may shed some light on the similar tenacity and durability of neoclassical economic theory.
&gt;
&gt; The postulation of an identity between energy and economic value began as an offshoot of the energetics movement, discussed in my book *More Heat Than Light* [Mirowski 1988]. By the 1880s, the physicist Georg Helm and the physical chemist and Nobel Laureate Wilhelm Ostwald were claiming that the program of energetics intended to unite all of the sciences under a small set of principles and concepts, and “all” clearly included the nascent social sciences. Researchers anxious to elevate the tone and status of social inquiry were quick to pick up the hint. Soon, all over Europe, aspirants were proclaiming that energy would render economics, biology, and physics all subsets of the same unified science.

This is a review/essay by Mirowski dealing more with not-so-illustrious proponents of the “energetics” movement, but he wrote also this very interesting book [More Heat than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics](https://books.google.com/books?id=rmVhZnHId-oC) about the emergence of the neo-classical school by the late nineteenth century under the spell of thermodynamics (the cutting-edge physics theory back then).

Another interesting book of his is [Machine Dreams: Economics Becomes a Cyborg Science](https://books.google.com/books?id=GkrYxL0QtpcC), where he discusses the influence of cybernetics upon economics by the mid-twentieth century. Particularly interesting, I think, is the substitution by the economists of their preferred metaphor of the market as a railroad network (i.e., the market as a transportation system that moves things and people from one place to another) by our contemporary tendency of describing the market as a information processor (i.e., the market as a big computer much more capable of solving problems than our feeble human minds, so that we must defer to the market, let the market decide).",t5_2swgc,False,,1462112781,t3_4h98ag,t3_4h98ag,0,1,d2ofc4u,,ogoidbr

I think you're missing the point of my argument. Of course, in the real world, an investor wouldn't put 100% of his money in a single company and would instead diversify. What I'm saying is that, if given the choice between either a bank or an insurance company, and no other information, the investor would choose the insurance company.

&gt; If you're trading shares in the stock market, unless you're looking at long term (many years) trends it's going to vary from company to company rather than just from industry to industry.

2,1462117708,linguistics,,0,1465560822,"Just to add a few more examples, there are a number of examples of labialized velar consonants diachronically becoming bilabial consonants. For example, the distinction between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages is primarily based on the former group's changing proto-Celtic \*/kʷ/ into /p/, giving us correspondences such as Welsh *pump* /pɨmp/ and Irish *cúig* /kuːɟ/, both deriving from Proto-Celtic \*kʷinkʷe. Or similarly, in certain environments Greek and Latin both changed proto-Indo-European \*/gʷ/ into /b/, giving us Latin *bōs* and Greek *βοῦς* /boːs/ which are etymologically related to the English word *cow*, all being derived from Proto-Indo-European \*gʷous.

As for the more general question about any acoustic similarities between velars and bilabials, in addition to noahpoah's comment about similarity in formant transition effects, I might also add that burst frequency may also play a part. Velar stops tend to have burst frequency ranges in between those of bilabial and alveolar stops:

Bilabial burst frequency: 500-1500 Hz

Velar burst frequency: 1500-2500 Hz

Alveolar burst frequency: 2500-4000 Hz

Ted Cruz has about 30% support there, and he even only has that due to people willing to compromise with the religious fundamentalists. That's only maybe 1 in 5, maybe 2 in 5 votes on strong Christian values. Even then, I see nothing wrong with that. The left is willing to have a religion of ""secular humanism"" and ""social justice"" as their key source of values, and even support someone having Islam as their key source of values, so I see nothing wrong with someone having Christianity as the place where they derive values from. You have no problems with a ""moral high ground,"" as long as it is your values. How many times am I told that I should ""care about X group,"" because it would be immoral to do so? How are those morals inherently superior to Christian morality? How is it more rational to shame someone in not supporting random sexual deviances (transgender stuff) because ""you say so (or, it's 2016, come on)"" over supporting pro-life law because ""Sky deity told me."" Both are morals that are brought from nothing, and have no factual basis in reality nor any logic behind them. Social justice and belief in the state is just as much a religion as Christianity, and perhaps much more dangerous, considering the insanely high amount of people that have died due to strong states over the past hundred years. Christianity has killed very, very few people compared to extremely strong secular governments (Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Communist China).


Specific examples for the Democrats include policies that hinder freedom of speech. Right now, they push for censorship on anything they deem ""racist"" or ""offensive."" It's already how it is in Europe, but they're pushing for it here. What that allows them to do is censor anything that doesn't fit in with their definition of liberalism or a liberal society, which forces us to only fit into one mold.


&gt; Jim Crowe era voter laws


If you're talking about voter ID laws, then just as many Democrats are pushing for that. Voter ID laws are reasonable, as it seems that I need ID to do every other one of my Constitutional rights. Democrats push for even needing a license for owning firearms, for example, which is definitely a non-liberal policy by the traditional definition of liberalism. By your bullshit definition of racism, I could say that firearm laws (restrictions) are racist, even more so than the voter ID laws.


Leftists in Europe and America actually seem quite fine putting religion near the front, so long as it's not Christianity. They seem to be okay letting Islam enter their countries, which is an inherently regressive policy, as it allows large amounts of religious fundamentalists that put the Westboro Baptist Church to shame to enter their countries. Letting large amounts of people from any 3rd world country is bad in this regard, Islamic populations being the worst, however. In Europe, they even go as far as to censor and arrest people willing to question this religion. These are leftists, so called progressives.

The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with ""relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,"" and a total admixture estimate ""very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.""

The problem is when EU decides (and yeah, I know we are the EU as well and we have representatives in the Brussels, the point was that  officials in Brussels no matter their nationality don't always make smarter decisions on how to spent money than the free market would) that Europeans would be more healthy if they did more sports (just a made-up example). So suddenly Czech ministry for local development gets a lot of money, but since the bureaucracy is slow and some of the local officials might be new or incompetent, everything gets delayed and we end up with a situation where we have to spend a lot of money very quickly otherwise we might lose them. And that wouldn't be good, since people don't like to hear it when politicians fail to use the money we got. So, hurry up, we have to spend, spend, spend, so what do we do? Well how about new routes for cyclists, there is no time to think of anything else and if we only do one big project then we will only have to make one tender. So suddenly we are building cycling routes like crazy, we build more of them than we actually need and we quickly move to another last-minute spending.

I've made this example up, but I have one personal experience with EU funds and it worked pretty much like this - no one cared to evaluate what benefits it will actually bring, the only goal was to get rid of the money quickly before the deadline passes, so that we can say that we spend the EU money. This kinda left me with a feeling that the money could be used much better. I don't know how widespread this wasting of money is, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was not that uncommon.",t5_2qh4j,False,CZEC,1462118670,t1_d2ogo8f,t3_4h8nvu,0,14,d2oiije,Czech Republic,kristynaZ

This rollercoaster was like one where you stand in line all giddy and excited, but the ride was not worth it in the end. Truthfully I'm just glad we got the point, it just gives me enough hope to continue watching this shit show of a team... So much promise yet it's constantly been a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, we've made progress from last season. It just isn't enough for me, and I'm sure most would agree. 

Side note, I'm fine with the Bacca sale (if it happens). His one-dimensional play is incredibly frustrating to watch; and his first touch is like Muntari's, utter shit. 

Mauri looks good, should have played over Poli earlier in the season. 

Kucka is a workhorse but he shouldn't be starting. He creates opportunities with his work rate, but he is far from clinical. 

Montolivo is garbage; he plays too slow and should not be wearing the armband. He is not captain material for Milan.

MDS played well, finally. That's the MDS we need.

And finally we see the true age of Alex as well as Dona.

But all in all we are progressing, rather than regressing (even if it feels like we have been). Next season, let's erase all the negativity, and start fresh. 
Next season is far more important than this one. Either we bounce back to where Milan should be, or we miss Europe again, ultimately selling our brightest talents to clubs that are actively competitive in Europe. ",t5_2rnmt,False,,1462119072,t3_4h9dmn,t3_4h9dmn,0,5,d2oiqst,,cubanitalia

Please tell me which Americans regularly watch Russian Streams, which South Africans are even visible as streamers on Twitch, and which non-English speaking Western Europeans have even a moderate following compared to major English language or Chinese streamers. There's a reason for example that Bulldog streams in English, and it's because he recognizes that there is a huge American market that he's just not going to be able to tap if he streams in Swedish... nor will many of the ~390 million non-Swedish European viewers have much interest in watching him.

It's not logical to say ""there are more people in large blocks of the world outside of China than there are Chinese people"" when demographic, language, and market nuances make that essentially irrelevant to the question of which language/nationality would have a bigger market cap for this type of product. Obviously regional nuances affect this even within China, but in a country where 90+% of the 1.4 billion population is concentrated in the South and East of the country and shares a language, you're talking about just a much larger single market.

I'm sure there are loads of fake viewers, but the ratio you would need to justify your argument is insane. Even if we assume that 4 out of every 5 viewers on the YYF stream that thread you linked mentioned is fake, he would still be surpassing Bulldog's count in the same photo by nearly 10 to 1. You would in fact have to assume that something like 97/98 out of every 100 viewers in that stream was fake, in order to account for the kind of fake viewer differential you're claiming here.

Ok, seen that game before. . .

next. 

then you simply apply tenacity to your claim, repeating what you said before, verbatim, without actually making an argument for your hypocritical-interpretations of meaning. 

I'm going to lay it out clear for you:

You apply meaning to terms, and terms are exchanged for meaning between people. 

Terms you use are loaded with special little meanings that dont apply to the language of others, and when you attempt to persuade them that they should, you overlook that those terms in meaning actually mean different things. Else, you're a hypocrite. 

Then. you achieve the status of hypocrite in the tenacious interpretation of whites, as: *""I'm proud that my race has oppressed people and through that oppression has been able to achieve great things by standing on the mountains of corpses of the people we have oppressed"".*

This statement proves you're racist, and you have the gaul to imply my comment is such, when my comment is mostly about language and logic.  

seriously, you're a fanatic of another sort, but blinded by some kind of hate, all alike.  You cant even see the hypocrisy of your statements 


Likewise:
*""I will be PROUD to be part of a culture that has a history of standing up to oppression""*

This little testimony was cute. If not an indicator to what you think historically happened. In fact, western European liberalism was the thing that freed POC from slavery and oppression, and a history of 'present' or 'yes' voting white-congressmen and parliamentary figures are what diminished inequality over the years, via legislation.

Even your interpretation of the history people of different ethnicity and backgrounds share in the US is twisted in some SJW reactionary zealousness. As if POC revolted against their masters and freed themselves, which didn't even happen during the civil war, as the majority white union and north had wanted and hoped for, with the emancipation proclamation. In fact, there were more revolting slave incidents in American history prior to the civil war, and in the north! So, where is this 'standing up to oppression' nonsense? POC and whites stood side by side, sometimes, against other POC and whites. Your 'race war' narrative is racist and no doubt indoctrinated, and all together wrong.

This article is very suspicious - a very sensationalized article from the Independent, known for its leftist bias - often much stronger than the traditionally leftist the guardian. 

Anyone here can point to **actual data** on how AirB'n'B raises rent for all apartments in Berlin? Germany has a very large and very robust renting market - very much unlike in Britain or the US and the prices are much lower, especially in the east. This would have to be a very serious increase in rent to threaten ""affordable housing"" in a country that is ""affordable"" compared to any other western European country. Berlin is a huge 4+ million city with very affordable housing prices for a capital city. How is that possible that all those apartments suddenly compete for tourists coming to Berlin? Because that is what would be necessary for a significant increase in rent cost.

There are also two important considerations:

How banning AirBnB will affect the incomes of people who were using it - just how many of them were rich people getting filthy rich and how many people earning on the side.

How are the rent prices affected by other factors - inflation, changes in credit availability on the financial markets, changes in Euro exchange rate, demographic changes etc etc.

Because so far I suspect a typical dishonest move by hotel industry which is the most threatened by the likes of AirB'n'B because unlike the housing base for a four million city there are a scarce number of hotels, and even fewer of them charge prices which can compete with AirBnB prices.So the standard play - throughout history - is to scream at the top of the lungs that you are doing something for the people and then do something that packs your pockets even more.  

Similar stories have been happening with Uber only here it's tough to really play the champion of the people when the taxi firms are shafting the same customer base. With AirBnB it is the people who are supposed to benefit (and I bet they will! politicians promise!) while the toursists are going to get shafted - thanks to AirBnB they paid lower prices, now they will be screwed by hotels once again.

Also Berlin is - IIRC - run by a leftist coalition, the mayor is from SPD so it's predictable that they would do something like that.

**Check when the elections in Berlin are happening**. It might be a move to both satisfy the hotel industry (donations!) and the populace to steer them away from radical parties like AfD, Linke etc which are very strong in former East Germany in general.",t5_2qh3l,False,,1462122312,t3_4h98hc,t3_4h98hc,0,1,d2okolk,,pharmaceus

He's not taking a shortcut. Kanye probably put in thousands of hours studying fashion, but he never went to school for fashion. He's still learning. Obviously there's going to be trial and error on such a big production. He even stated in interviews that he couldn't get the right type of fabrics and production for Yeezy Season 1. It's not like he's backed by a big fashion house like the rest of the popular designers. I'm positive that the amount of money Adidas gave Kanye to produce Yeezy Season 1 is no where near close to the type of money these big fashion houses give the designers over in Europe. And I'm not saying he deserves that type of money yet, but he has to work with the budget he's given. This fashion thing is not easy, but for us to critique him from behind our computers not knowing what is going on behind the scenes isn't a really fair conversation.

Great question, at launch we are only going to be available to North American markets. The reason for this is each financial market we subscribe to - NYSE, TSX, OMX, etc. - charges an individual data subscription fee which is quite steep.

As a side note we are planning to build in a feature that will allow users to enter ""other"" transactions. These would show up in your investment portfolio but would need to be updated manually. This isn't an ideal solution but until we can afford the extra markets it would be a workaround.

That said our team absolutely wants to expand Stockers to handle stock markets around the world once we can afford to do so.

A question for you though as our team doesn't have as much experience in the European markets as we do here. Would you use a product like Stockers to help manage your investments or do you have alternative products you prefer to use?

Additionally, whether you would use Stockers or an alternate, would you consider paying for such a service if it removed all advertisements and added some extra features or would you be content with a free service that is supported by ads?

Any information you can provide is very helpful to us. We want to try and listen to our potential customers as much as is possible to develop a product that meets your needs.

It wasn't until the imperialism that began in the 1700s that virtually every spot on earth eventually came under the control of some nation state or another.  This led to nationalism, a competition for land and territory, and latent prejudices which ultimately led to World War 1.  In 1912, Abdu'l-Bahá even mentioned that ""We are on the eve of the Battle of Armageddon referred to in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation. The time is two years hence, when only a spark will set aflame the whole of Europe.""

&gt; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places

All of these references have both inward and outward meaning.  I'm not familiar with the history of famines and earthquakes.  I'd recommend reading at least the first part of the Kitab-i-Íqán; a large portion of the text gives specific interpretations for Matthew 24:29-31.  I think it makes a good starting point for the rest of Matthew 24.

&gt; “9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

&gt; 10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

&gt; 11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.""

I think (9) is best understood in terms of (10), especially in recent history.  If we interpret the ""you"" in (9) as referring to believers in God, we can see how there is rising opposition to religiosity throughout the world.  In contrast, since the beginning of Christianity, the Church has been the political center of Europe.  It has now been replaced by the nation state.  See [this article](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-08-10-europe-religion-cover_x.htm) for the very recent trend.  Similarly, Islam is finding itself at war with itself (in many respects).  With respect to Matthew 24:11, check out [NRMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_religious_movement).

Lastly, I think it makes the most sense to interpret Matthew 24 as referring to the events that will immediately precede, accompany, and follow the coming of the return of Christ.  If you notice, Matthew 24 doesn't refer to specific events; it doesn't say ""On day X this war will happen, and on day X+1 Christ will return"".  Rather, it describes patterns.  For example, ""many false prophets will appear"", doesn't name a particular time-frame.  Similarly, the language ""all these are the beginning of sorrows"" (where ""sorrows"" is sometimes translated as ""birth pains"") evokes a period of time, rather than a specific time.",t5_2qi5p,False,,1462124490,t3_4h824d,t3_4h824d,0,4,d2om2vc,,aibiT4tu

With all the money we've spent, I look around at the team and wonder where the hell it all went?

Our midfield is fucking garbage.  Nonexistant.  Fernandinho is the only one worth a shit.  Yaya was wonderful for us, but his days are gone.  Then we have fernando, delph.  These guys are decent players but not worthy of a club vying to be the best in europe.

Our fullbacks are an absolute issue.  For years now we've had clichy, kolarov and sagna, zabaleta.  None of which are ""world class"".  

Our wingers and outside mids are also just not good enough.   I'm still holding out for sterling,  but he seems like he can't be fucking arsed and is only out to collect a check.  Was really counting on him offering an attacking threat,  something navas, nasri, just dont.  Navas is not good enough, simple as that.  Nasri is a player I really don't like, but some people here do.  He slows everything down, just uses his body and shields the ball while eventually trying to force some one-two that just isn't there.

As for our strikers, we've went through a few in the past years, and thank fucking God for aguero.  Dzeko was a better player that bony and yet he wasn't good enough I feel.

Our coach is inept, has very strange tactics and doesn't aim to change things when it's clear something needs to be done.  The whole fullback situation,  with them charging forward the second we get the ball, is fucking atrocious.   The guys who seem to get on the ball the most and start our attacks are kolarov and zabaleta,  the two people we DON'T want on the ball.  They overlap when it's unnecessary, because navas is already running down that side because the guy cannot cut inside on his left-- he just can't do it.  So they try and overlap and just drag another defender to help stop the cross.

Pep sure has his work cut out for him-- we need massive reinforcements and a clearing out of all this deadweight this summer.  Should really be interesting...

Edit:  our team has no balance at all.  Fullbacks just running forward, not realizing when to go forward and when to stay back.  Midfielders not closing down and offering cover when the fullbacks do push forward.  Wingers/outside mids who cannot cut inside and offer an attacking threat.  Alot of people checking to the ball, wanting it into feet, and not enough people looking to run in behind.  Just general lethargy and slow paced football, always getting worked because of lack of effort in certain positions.

Upon leaving the presidency, he embarked on a two year tour of Europe / African Safari.

His return from the trip was greeted with massive adulation, thousands came out to welcome him back in person.  By this time Roosevelt also learned that Taft had embraced the establishment wing of the Republican Party, a group that TR had always kept at arms length.  This, combined with a perceived feeling of malaise, let TR to challenge Taft in the primary (this is not a perfect answer to your question, because he did seek the office again).  After loosing the primary (due to Tafts support among the Republican establishment) TR went on to found the progressive party, but would place 2nd (to Woodrow Wilson) in the election of 1908.  Even after this defeat, he remained vocal, especially with the advent of WW1. He advocated for greater American involvement.

I thought that it is common sense that you don't inherently get 'wiser' with age, but instead it is the experiences you have through your life that make you wiser. My mistake. ... ...

Age is a good rule of thumb, mostly because people hang around their own age groups, and get experiences with things at roughly the same time. But if someone has friends that are older (even an older sibling), they will get exposed to certain things faster. They will learn it before others. The main issue I take with is *which* age you have selected and why. I will ask this question once again in hopes that you might actually answer it in case you missed it: (I also would like to know what you thought about my examples about the sandwich - but that is less important)

&gt;If our society deemed 16 to be a fully grown adult, would you be making the argument that 16 is where most of the coercion could happen? Or would you stick to 18? Which, age, and why?

In other words, why did you chose 18 as the magic number to allow people to have sex? Why not 15? why not 21? People in America cannot buy alcohol until 21, why not make it consistent?


&gt; But, there's a point when you must consider the pros and cons of it

I see no pros in charging teenagers with rape and putting them on a sexual offender's list when they have sex with each other. It's like the war on drugs, but with sex. Having it illegal doesn't stop people from doing it, it just puts the people who do it (most) at a risk of being charged with a crime, which will do more damage than the act would have ever done. I would even go as far as to say that it makes the society worse.


Pros| Cons
---|---
Learning how to stay safe | Teenagers can talk about sex more freely
Lower fear of being prosecuted| Teens continue to have sex (Oh the horror! How will they cope!?)
Not a sexual offender if has sex | Teenagers could go against what their parents say and have sex (parent cannot use the 'I will call the police, and have him locked up' threat)
Ability to get help if something did happen(eg. rape) without being afraid of being prosecuted too | Less births overall
Less unsafe abortions | ?
Less teen pregnancies | ?
Less unwanted children | ?
Life not ruined as name doesn't pop up in the sexual offenders list | ?

Please feel free to also make a list of pros/cons, I have yet to hear one pro that is strictly related to the person's age.

&gt;You can subject everyone to a mental evaluation to determine if they're able to have sex, however that would be accomplished

You can also just allow everyone who hit puberty to have sex. Wow, so hard.

&gt;I admire your effort to question and challenge arbitrary laws and cut points in our society, and how, in the future, our 'ancient ways' will probably be sneered at and ridiculed

I've got to say... It already has. Europe is very open to sex. Teenagers have sex all the time, no one cares as everyone was taught how to be safe. Many, if not most countries have laws which allow at least teenagers to have sex with each other, (I believe in my country it was 13+ but the partner must be within a 3 yr age difference, unless they are &gt;17 - something like that). America, especially certain places in America are very prudish, and make you ashamed and afraid of sex. When a teenager can go on a sexual offender's list just because they had sex with someone or be charged with production of child porn when they take a photo of themselves nude, I say that country is batshit insane.

This is so absolutely baffling to me - how can someone, a sane, educated person I'd hope, after more than six years of Orbán and his thugs being in power, rampaging through the country, wasting an oppurtunity (EU funds) that we will never have, ever again; and the whole system of government having been restructured to be nothing more than a convenient way for him and his cronies to embezzle taxpayer money, still believe that FIDESZ is the shiniest of all the turds... It is absolutely, by far the shittiest party in the Hungarian Parliament today. When MSZP was in power there was an incredible ammount of corruption and not enough honest officials to prosecute everyone, but for Chirst sake they lost an election because of seemingly (and thats the key word here) rampant corruption! But today it seems that there is a whole new scandal every week involving not millions, not hundreds of millions but billions and hundreds of billions of public funds and then some ""party soldier"" comes up and says: ""Oh yeah, we did that, got any problems with it?"" and then nothing happens. No mass protests, nothing. Corruption and absolute incompetence is not some fault or error in the system anymore, no, that is the way it works ""under normal operating conditions"" now. The ""glory days"" of the good-old-boy way of doing things is upon us again and it is most definitely FIDESZ's fault.

The way corruption and cronyism happens in Hungary today compared to the way it did 7+ years ago is so markedly different (and not in a positive way) that it is impossible to miss if one looks at things objectively.

I would say I was literally addicted to solo travel, and it was very hard to return to my isolated part of Canada where any travel at all was stupidly expensive and time-consuming.

There's nothing cuddly about the left. Just because Corbyn is an old guy with a beard, it doesn't mean he's nice. Old scruffy men can hold evil views. If I, as a conservative Jew, held an Israel flag in London, it'd be the far leftist bigots who would eventually attack me. 

The leftist antisemitic tropes are exactly the same as those in Nazi Germany. The words 'Jew', 'rootless cosmopolitan', and 'international bankers', are replaced by 'Zionist', '1%', 'Bankers', 'World Order', etc. I wonder why? 

The National Socialists were to the right of the Soviets, and were painted as such by the Soviets for propaganda, because they were two competing socialisms. The Nazis were socialists, and the rhetoric of today's left reflects the Nazi's perfectly.

The left are, and always have been, extremely dangerous. Especially for Jews.

The islamofascists all support Jeremy Corbyn, don't they? They don't tend to align with the Tory party, do they? Why do you place them on the right? They're hardly laissez-faire free marketeers.

This was not at all like the steppes and hence not 'home turf', especially Yunnan and southern provinces which are essentially tropical.

Further West, the conquest of Persia involved campaigning through mountains, and forays into Syria and Anatolia brought the Mongols into contact with harsh regions lacking enough grass for fodder for their horses. Syria was never fully brought under control, and authors such as Perry Anderson link the Mongol success in Russia in particular to the steppe itself. David Morgan writes that:

&gt; the inadequacy of pasture lands, especially in southern Syria, was a major reason for repeated Mongol failures

&gt;In 1944, Allied forces only liberated the south and east of the Netherlands, to push forward into Germany. The west, and some pockets in the north, were simply ignored.

Absolutely incorrect, there were no pockers in the west or north ignored. The frontline at the end of November 1944 remained stagnated until March 1945, and as you can [see from this map](http://crimsonaudio.net/Normandy_1944/0328d.jpg) there was a continuous front all the way from Germany to the North Sea north of the Waal River. Amserdam was not even remotely cut off, yet their rations dropped to 1000kilocalories in November 1944. 

The historic consensus (not your revisionist garbage) is that the German occupation administration, led by Friedrich Christiansen, placed a food embargo on the Netherlands to retaliate for their resistance to German occupation in late 1944. It was a deliberate policy, not some result of Allied blockade or whatever, and even when the famine kicked off it was never completely lifted. 

The lack of food in the Netherlands lies completely at the feet of the Germans, who had no problem pillaging western Europes food and industry to keep the German population at home insulated from the privations of War. That the same policy, which resulted in millions of Poles and Russians starving to death during the various occupations of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia proper, had the same effect on the Dutch people, is hardly the fault of the Allies. 

&gt;The Allies didn't only cause it, they made it worse. Food droppings, like these, mostly ended up in the hands of German soldiers instead of citizens. Those lucky enough to be able to gather any food would risk getting shot to death, but they would likely die of starvation anyway.

Allies make an effort to drop food to the Netherlands, Germans steal said food allowing civilians to starve and shot a bunch of them, obviously the Allies made things worse. LOL.

&gt;When the German forces capitulated, some citizens were genuinely thankful of the Canadian and British forces that entered the cities. But many were more angry at the Allies than at the German soldiers; the Allied forces had been waiting at the frontline for months, doing nothing, while citizens starved to death, froze to death or died in the unrest.

Yeah, it was the Allies fault the Germans continued to defend until winter put a halt to offensive operations. 

&gt; In the end, when not counting the victims of the concentration camps, the Allied blockade from late 1944 till early 1945 killed more Dutchmen than the German military forces from 1940-1945...

Yeah, if we ignore the industrialized murder of the majority of Dutch victims in WWII, the allies may have been worse then the Germans! Most disingenuous exception made in an argument I have seen in awhile. The majority of Dutch deaths in WWII were holocaust losses, all perpetrated by the Germans. The Germans killed far more Dutch people in WWII then Allies.

Boers to me are obvious #1 picks. They are 16 goddamn techs ahead of 3rd place in techs, and even without declaring wars Finland also remains a top 6 pick and they are even farther back in techs. Do I need to remind everyone that Finland has declared a single relevant war?



Iceland literally just did what everyone was begging them to do, go to war with France. They are currently at a point where we can safely say that they will gain 5-8 more cities, including numerous High pop cities. Iceland is also no longer technologically backwards, and they have a HUGE fleet of advanced destroyers and Missile cruisers, so I see no reason to put them lower than they already were.


Yakutia is in no way 8th place. Sleepy, weak, and increasingly farther behind technologically. They could be conquered by Mongolia at this point.


Canada just DoW'd a civ with a paratrooper carpet while they currently wield GWI. If that wasn't enough, they have a fairly aggresive  giant up north. Even If the Blackfoot don't take a city, Canadia will be weakened


Chile is in a position where they are able to survive basically any attack excluding the Aussies. And that alone puts them above the Middle east and lesser European civs+ lesser Asian civs.


Sparta. Just look at their lands, that's enough evidence.



Arabia is in the Info era. And what are their neighbors in? What's that? Did you say they still have rifleman? Oh my.


The Kimberley are strong but now they are trapped between 2 terrifyingly strong navies.


The Mali are split up, and their pop is still recovering from the nukes, and with two carpets, the strongest navy in the world, and a fairly strong army surrounding them, do they really have any hope.

But why? if you're losing money extracting oil... you shouldn't do it? Venezuela doesn't actually *want* to default, just like how Canadian operators don't. They've already invested in the equipment (Capital Expenditure) and they can still sell oil at (probably) a marginal 'profit' if you only consider Operational Expenditure (workers).

4,False,worldnews,,0,1465566650,"&gt;It's scary that so many kids today have moved so far left, that they view capitalism and the free market as ""extremist"".

One defining characteristic of extremists is that they need strawmen to define and defend their systems with. ""Leftists"", ""kids"". That's just very lazy thinking. I'm sure you can do better than that.

&gt;After a century of seeing socialism destroy everything it touches, it's incredible that people like yourself have forgotten history's lessons and are instead, falling for the same old ""I have the right to X. The government should supply X to everyone"" trap that has wreaked so much havoc across the world.

I think your perception of socialism is not a very nuanced one.

Marxism certainly destroys everything it touches. Because it rejects scientific economics and relies on dogmas from holy scriptures and on magical thinking instead. Marxism produces cases like Venezuela. But socialism, no.

Look at Europe, one of the wealthiest and most highly developed regions on the planet. Countries like Norway, Sweden or Denmark have a huge public sector, and yet they are not only among the continuously richest countries on the planet, they also lead the ranks for education, happiness, etc. The idea is not, as you assume, that the government provides everything, the idea is that the government guarantees realistic societal minimum standards that benefit everyone in society. If someone wants more from life than this minimum, then he has to earn it. And people do earn it.

Free markets are a valuable tool for an efficient resource allocation. More efficient than any alternative system that humans have written on the drawing table. But free markets are not perfect. They have their limits, they have their flaws and they can be exploited royally. They are a means, not an end. And their weaknesses have to be compensated.

&gt;Human beings DO need motivation to work. That's basic psychology. You do work and you receive compensation for it. That's how the world works. That's how inventions work. That's how startup companies work. The entire process of invention and of creativity works based on the underlying idea that if you create something that betters other people's lives in some way, they'll provide you something in return for it. That's what the entire concept of money is. It's incentive to work/create.

I never denied that humans need motivation. The thing is, humans are inherently motivated to perform, to be better than everyone else. They want to create, to present their work, to have a wife and a car that makes their neighbor envious. It's in their nature. They don't need external pressure to be like that. In the real world the main poverty risks are poor health and poor education. Self-reinforcing problems. Because those who have the least money to get out of poor health or education are the people with poor health or education. What good is it to leave people rot in these holes? A society that doesn't help them out with guaranteed public services is a society that uselessly and needlessly cripples itself. It wastes its human resources, the most valuable resources a society can have nowadays.",t5_2qh13,False,,1462135983,t1_d2oi3vf,t3_4h70q6,0,4,d2otgz0,,anteupblackjack

We also get blank and bleach from this same root, although the meaning we use has changed a bit.

Long answer: 8 teams go into each group stage, and places 5 through 8 are determined by group stage results.

After two times through that procedure, the 4 teams with the most points advance to the live finals.

The live finals involve 8 teams (4 NA, 4 EU) and will also have a group stage. The teams will be broken down into two groups of four, each group being two NA and two EU teams, and after the group stage two teams will be eliminated from each group.

Most software EULAs aren't worth the paper (or in this case, bytes) they are written on - they are *not* law nor do they supercede local laws. If you don't believe me go and read some of the EULAs supplied with FS addons, they are laughable. For example I know Iris claim the copyright to the ""likeness"" of all their addon aircraft. I think the aircraft manufacturers might take issue with that.

The issue with selling used addons is of course is whether or not the vendors/publishers will honour the activations of a piece of second hand software, and whether or not you are prepared to take them to court if they don't.

The flightsim addon market is a legal mess. Let's say a guy in the US buys an Orbx addon from the Flightsim Store. Orbx are a British company, the Flightsimstore in an Australian company but operate from servers located in Hong Kong. Whose laws apply?

1,False,worldnews,,0,1465567928,"William the Conquerer's Casus Belli was that he was given leave to invade and conquer England by the Pope. So no, it was indeed not set up as a secular monarchy.

In early medieval times, kings often appointed bishops themselves and as such wielded both temporal and ecclesiastical power. In Catholic Europe the Pope fought, by word and by sword, for the power to appoint Bishops himself. In some places, like Germany, the Pope was ultimately victorious. In other places there was a compromise where the Pope choose bishops in consensus with the local ecclesiastical hierarchy, in a few places the Pope lost and bishops remained under royal rule.

The reformation begins a new era in this power struggle, where the most dissatisfied rulers simply switch to protestantism and cut the Pope out entirely, subordinating the church to their rule. Areas that remained Catholic generally saw the state drastically increase in power, and Monarchs heavily curtailing the power and influence of the Pope and his bishops in favour of their own.

Then in the enlightenment the concept of separation of church and state is developed, both as a further curtailment of papal power in Catholic states, and from a burgeoning concept of national identity and human rights which transcended religious affiliations. The French Revolution spreads these ideas across continental Europe.

The inability of the Pope to maintain control of the larger Papal States against the movement for a unified Italian state, and later on the complete inefficacy of the Pope's attempts to prevent and stop the first World War, can be seen as the final loss of Religious identity to National and Class identity and with it the general disappearance of religion as a major transnational political force in the West. Religion of course remains a potent political force, but it is always ultimately subordinate to National or Class identity and is largely expunged from the structures of government in favour of pure national institutions centred around those National or Class identities.",t5_2qh13,False,,1462140379,t1_d2or56f,t3_4h8en2,0,1,d2ow6po,,NFB42

-3,False,worldnews,,1,1465568506,"""Poverty is the parent of crime."" For those wrongfully placing the blame for the economic crises on the fact that Venezuela's president is a socialist, it would do you well to gain a better understanding of the situation before you speak out about it. 

The corporate media would have you believe that Venezuela is a dictatorship; a country where human rights crusaders and anti-government, democracy-seeking activists are routinely rounded up and thrown in jail. Indeed, the picture from both private media in Venezuela, as well as the mainstream press in the US, is one of a corrupt and tyrannical government desperately trying to maintain its grip on power while the opposition seeks much-needed reforms. In fact, the opposite is true.

The sad reality of Venezuela is that it is the Bolivarian Revolution that is being undermined, targeted, and destabilized. It is the Socialist Party (PSUV), its leftist supporters (and critics), Chavista activists and journalists, and assorted forces on the Left that are being victimized by an opposition whose singular goal is power. This opposition, now in the majority in the National Assembly, uses the sacrosanct terminology of “freedom,” “democracy,” and “human rights” to conceal the inescapable fact that it has committed, and continues to commit, grave crimes against the people of Venezuela in the service of its iniquitous agenda, shaped and guided, as always, by its patrons in the United States.

This so-called opposition – little more than the political manifestation of the former ruling elites of Venezuela – wants nothing less than the total reversal of the gains of the Bolivarian Revolution, the end of Chavismo, and the return of Venezuela to its former status as oil colony and wholly owned subsidiary of the United States. And how are these repugnant goals being achieved? Economic destabilization, street violence and politically motivated assassinations, and psychological warfare are just some of the potent weapons being employed.

the economic difficulties the country is facing can be directly attributed to the insidious efforts of Venezuela’s right wing opposition, and its backers in the United States. While corporate media reports over the last two years have shown viscerally shocking images of empty store shelves, blaming supply problems on the incompetence and corruption of the Maduro government, none of the stories bother to examine the question of why supplies have dwindled in the way they have.

There is analysis pointing to corruption (an important problem to be tackled, to be sure), as well as lack of access to capital, and myriad other issues. But never does one find the real crux of the problem being discussed: supply and distribution remains in the hands of the right wing elites whose interests are served by making life unbearable for the masses of poor and working people.

As renowned economist and former Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations Julio Escalona explained in Caracas on the eve of the December 2015 elections which ushered back into the National Assembly the right wing:

The majority of Venezuela’s imports and distribution networks are in the hands of the elite… Many of the goods needed for Venezuelan consumption are diverted to Brazil and Colombia. We are experiencing manufactured scarcity, a crisis deliberately induced as a means of destabilization against the government…This is psychological war waged against the people of Venezuela in an attempt to intimidate them into abandoning the government and the socialist project entirely.

The significance of this point cannot be overstated, as the lack of basic necessities, coupled with daily obstacles such as long lines at supermarkets, is enough to bring hardened Chavista activists, let alone ordinary Venezuelans, to question or even abandon the political project. And that is precisely the goal – make the economy scream, so the Chavistas will shut their mouths.

Of course, there’s little doubt that the scarcity of goods is largely manufactured for political ends. One need only look at the conspicuous reappearance of goods in the immediate aftermath of the right wing Unity Roundtable (MUD) victory in the December 2015 elections to see how connected the supply problems are with political agendas. Additionally, massive hoarding of basic consumer goods in warehouses owned by prominent Venezuelan business interests sheds added light on the lengths to which the right wing opposition and elites will go to make their own country’s economy scream.

And then there’s the economic elephant in the room: oil. According to OPEC figures, oil revenue accounts for roughly 95% of Venezuela’s export earnings, with the energy sector comprising roughly a quarter of GDP. In eighteen months (April 2014-January 2016), the price per barrel of crude oil has dropped from $108 to under $30, a drop of nearly 75%. This price collapse has devastated Venezuela’s economy as oil revenue is needed to provide everything from basic services to the continuation of the public housing mission. And while President Maduro has refused to implement austerity, it has undeniably impacted the overall economy.

But is this price collapse merely the product of “simple economics” as the New York Times recently wrote? Or is it yet another orchestrated assault on oil-producing nations targeted by the US ? Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly implied that in late 2014 as the oil plunge took shape. Putin stated, “There’s lots of talk about what’s causing [the lowering of the oil price]. Could it be the agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to punish Iran and affect the economies of Russia and Venezuela? It could.” Indeed, the collapse of oil couldn’t have come at a more opportune time for the US globally, or for the US proxy opposition inside Venezuela, as the effects of the plunge had obvious and immediate political ramifications.

One should also include hyper-speculation against Venezuela’s currency on the list of economic weapons being employed. Everything from the removal of currency and commodities out of the country, to the fostering and promotion of black market currency exchanges, has driven inflation through the roof in the country. While economic policy and mismanagement indeed play a role in this, it is equally true that the bolivar is yet another victim of the economic war.

It would be very difficult for any country to manage to ride out the confluence of negative economic developments and domestic economic subversion that Venezuela has had to endure. But coupled with a campaign of political violence and psychological war, the destabilization has taken on new dimensions.

In the US, and throughout North America and Europe, when one hears of violence in Venezuela, it is almost always either in the context of street violence or alleged “brutal crackdowns” on political protesters. However, the real political violence is carried out by the right wing opposition, its paramilitary allies, and their backers in the US.

Perhaps no targeted killing has had a greater impact on the country and the Revolution than the 2014 assassination of Robert Serra, a young, up-and-coming legislator from the PSUV who was murdered by individuals connected to former Colombian President and self-declared enemy of the Bolivarian Revolution, Alvaro Uribe. Serra was seen by many as the future of the PSUV and of the Chavista movement in the country.  His murder was interpreted by millions as a direct assault on the Revolution and the future of the country.

Just this year, Venezuela has seen a number of other assassinations carried out by the same networks backed by the right wing and their international allies. The well-respected journalist and prominent Chavista Ricardo Duran was murdered outside his home in Caracas. Likewise, Fritz St. Louis, International Coordinator of the United Socialist Haitian Movement and Secretary General of the Haitian Cultural House Bolivariana de Venezuela was assassinated. Recently, Venezuela also saw opposition “activists” in the western city of San Cristobal brutally run down two police officers after the “protesters” hijacked a bus.

Sadly, there are many more killings that could be listed here. Such political violence is yet another indication of the “dirty war” – to borrow a term all too familiar in Latin America – being waged against the Bolivarian Revolution and Venezuela’s government.

This sort of violence sends a very clear message throughout Venezuelan society: do not stand up for your rights; do not try to defend the revolution.

And that message is continually hammered home by a right wing media that is, in effect, the propaganda arm of the right wing opposition and the United States. As author and investigative journalist Eva Golinger revealed in 2007, the US funded a program to provide financial support to Venezuelan journalists hostile to Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution. This was a concerted effort aimed at influencing public opinion through the right-wing media, shaping the views of Venezuelans against their government. And that propaganda assault continues to this day, utilizing every possible means of disinformation and misinformation to turn the people of Venezuela against the Bolivarian Revolution, and against the socialist project.

The opposition and its US patrons ceaselessly trumpet democracy and human rights, while having no regard for either in Venezuela. From quite literally taking food from the mouths of Venezuelans, to wantonly killing Chavistas and citizens alike, the opposition has proven itself to be not just reactionary and anti-democratic, but brazenly criminal.

In these times of political and economic turmoil in the Bolivarian Republic, one must recall just what exactly the so-called “opposition” is. And one must equally consider what sort of country Venezuela will become were they to be given even the slightest bit more power.",t5_2qh13,False,,1462142424,t3_4ha9pa,t3_4ha9pa,0,-3,d2oxes2,,Subbotnik

They're as much a Muslim as most Christians are Christian. While I'm not going to go into the argument of ""true"" vs ""not true"" Muslim, I'll point out that those governments were actually adhering to Islam, the situation would be very different.

&gt;Look, i simply do not want any more muslims on my continent.

Oh it's yours an no one else's? Fantastic. I thought there were other people living on that continent with which you shared the decisions regarding its fate.

Besides, if your so-called superior culture is indeed so superior, then you'll have to stick to secularism. This means regulating immigration without care for the persons' religion. If you want to regulate immigration, then fine. By all means.

Secondly, responding to your question.

-1,False,europe,,1,1465569216,"&gt; If you don't consider your own life to be worth more than that of a random arab in Syria then would you say that the arab needs your money more than you do?

Of course they do; after my basic necessities are covered, I still have about a quarter of my income extra. And I'm not even upper middle class.

&gt; Tribalistic monkey-think also includes that you care more about your children, parents or siblings than other people. 

It does. I freely admit that most of the time I'm not acting according to that principle. Knowing what is right is far from doing the right thing. There is a clear conflict of our more innate urges to do what is right for us, instead of doing what is right for society. Smart people like Kant showed that it is an illusion, and the second ideal actually holds true.

We overcame this border many times before, first by becoming societies at all, later by becoming nation states, and recently, we formed many conglomerates of nations like the UN, EU and NATO. 

But a globalized world demands a global society, and it is not going to stop because we want it differently. The refugee crisis is the perfect example. Americans with their giant moat are laughing their asses off, Europeans get delusional by thinking they could just shut the border and keep the problem in their front-yard. 

In my opinion, the only solution to the refugee crisis is a comprehensive integration of the immigrants currently here, while also forming a united re-engagement with our neighborhood that includes monetary aid, as well as military intervention where needed.",t5_2qh4j,False,EURO,1462144875,t1_d2oy6k5,t3_4h9gq1,0,-1,d2oyu1s,Germany,bakuninsbart

Well don't discount yourself. I don't feel like you have any real reason to lie to me. This is a conversation about opposing view points and I don't think either of us actually believes the other will walk away a completely changed man. I'm willing to take any source or quotes you give me and at least reflect on them. I am genuinely interested in understanding the way you think. If I weren't I wouldn't sub here obviously. 

&gt;They had assimilated the viscous hatred of Germany that the British had had for a very long time.

I don't believe that, considering a huge amount of whites fighting in WW2 were ethnically German. 

In the case of Harrison, I understand where he's coming from. The flip side of the coin is that the German people were complicit in genocide. I can understand why the Allies would consider giving German homes to the tremendous amount of displaced persons, a result of the genocide, conquering, and war brought on those European people by these very same Germans. It's an issue of Germans supporting the atrocities, and then suffering the penalty of those atrocities. Because it is extremely difficult to pick out and punish a single German for supporting the Nazi Party if they weren't an active participant in their misdeeds, I can understand why the Allies would say ""Fuck em'. Put all the refugees in German houses. Why would we build refugee camps when we can just give them the Nazi's homes?"" I don't feel that it's *justifiable*, necessarily, but I can understand the motivations behind the sentiment. When Harrison mentions his Anglo-Saxon conscience, it's important to note that both Germany and the US shared a great deal of academic beliefs, along side cultural beliefs. I feel that this is a byproduct of heavy German immigration to the US prior to both world wars. For a *long* time Germany was the single largest source for immigrants to the US. Many German and American scientists put great emphasis on white superiority, and for a long time some states in the US mandated sterilization programs for convicts, non-white immigrants, etc. I believe this shared set of ideals between Germany and the US played a large part in many of our officials beliefs on race. Again, I'm not saying this is good or bad, just that it happened, as purely, as clinically as I can. 

At the end of the day, I also want a Europe specifically and **only** for Europeans. I believe every race should have the right to their own homelands. I just think genocide is a step to far.

3,False,news,,0,1465569400,"Well, I hope my English can be accepted as proper or at least understandable. Im denglishing a bit, mostly when it comes to grammar (which somehow destroys my original point) but just hear me out please.

You seem to speak from a viewpoint where you can really evaluate the quality of the ""german english"" and that is a qualification I may never have as I am not a native speaker. Yet Im thinking you are overgeneralising a problem that counts for globalisation as a whole.
I believe that this more of a question which generation you belong to. Counting for anything older than twenty you are most certainly right. The quality of english classes back then just lacked the profession that was needed for an growing international market. Actually the ability to speak english fluently is often seen as a profile necessity for every politician or every leading figure especially in foreign relations. The problem is that figures like Goettinger seem to get elected by those who arent the best anglophones themselves. A lot of older generations might understand a sentence or two, but not if actually spoken in conversation. They just have no idea of fluent english. The concept of understanding a language lies in trying to emulate its culture. And older generations just dont have those cultural ties to the world outside of Germany that younger ones might have. 

And Goettinger is seen as a public joke here, too. He kind of stands for the hollownes of the acclaimed expertise of the ruling classes. A bit of a ""the emperors new clothes"" piece. This guy doesnt just speak proper english, he is now Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society. Tells a lot about the political focus of the ruling conservative CDU if they send this guy to the EU. ""Das Netz ist Neuland für uns"". Yeah, right.
Hes just the example of an older generation that still doesnt quite care for the world around them, that hasnt grasped the concept of globalisation yet.

BUT that doesnt count for the whole of Germany. Younger generations know the importance of being able to converse in a language that doesnt limit them to the heart of europe. And while the quality of individual language abilities naturally varies, its  pretty unusual having to translate for someone nowadays. 
Quite kafkaesque if you ask me. When it comes to a fluent conversation with non-german speakers, the common twenty-year old fairs much better than most acclaimed foreign relations experts. You often just have to listen to the way ""experts"" pronounce and use english terms in talk shows to denounce them as real experts or frauds.",t5_2qh3l,False,,1462145540,t1_d2ox6m0,t3_4h98hc,0,3,d2oz83h,,FelicusLeidi

Anarchism is about any governing structure, any hierarchy. So if someone else owns the land you're on, you have to abide by their rules. If you don't, you get to suffer their punishments. They can call themselves whatever they want, from king to lord to landlord, but the effect is all the same. And if they have the ability, it is not Anarchism.

That definition of Feudalism is far too narrow. There are several places in the world the have experienced Feudalism, not just medieval Europe. The aspects that they have in common is that the rulers doesn't simply govern, but governs through their ownership of the land. If they want to attack a neighboring land, they needed to prove a claim that they owned it.

Yes, there are some aspects that are different. For example, most Feudal systems existed before the concepts of Capitalism was solidified. Due to Anarcho-capitalism's emphasis on private ownership, I would advocate for Neofeudalism as a more appropriate term as they are pretty close, but many of the cultural aspects associated with Feudalism have been stripped away.",t5_2qh3v,False,,1462146026,t1_d2ow2xe,t3_4h81ee,0,2,d2ozi9m,,tryllion

It's an easy topic to google, but [here's one](https://stop-ttip.org/what-is-the-problem-ttip-ceta/) that seemed rational and somewhat thorough.

The fact that the negotiations are secret and result in huge inscrutable volumes with lots of sneaky stuff thrown in is bad enough, but the publicly declared stuff makes it suspicious from the start. Increased involvement of corporations in legislation and regulation, and opening new markets to exploitation by massive corporations another big deal. There's plenty more.

But it seems like a bad idea to assume because world leaders are on board that it must not be so bad. Most world leaders are extremely wealthy and it is in their interest to protect their assets by propping up huge corporations and enabling them to leech off the public with their political power. The US is hardly a representative democracy at this point and is increasingly plutocratic, and a lot of the TTIP sounds like involving/copying the US models for capitalism and industry regulation in the EU.

What? that's not true - the gas price drop has been because of increased supply, not reduced demand.

Many of these jobs are just for show, and people collect paychecks without actually doing anything.

[Pensions are another problem.](http://www.europeanpensions.net/ep/A-Greek-tragedy.php)  They're very generous, with people retiring beginning in their 40's, so that a very large percentage of the population are young, healthy and of working age -- and fully supported as retirees.

&gt; Early pensioners from the public sector still enjoy pensions of 1,000 net after 25 years of ‘service’. Just 200-300 euro less than the net salary they used to receive. So is the case of Anna.

Armenians were in close interaction with European cultures since Ancient Greek and Roman times (and later with Eastern Europe / Slavs), as well as with Asian cultures (Persian, Turkic, Mongolian, Indian), and local neighboring ones (Georgian, Aramaic, etc). Historically the best we can tell is that Armenians were a group related to Greeks that absorbed local ethnicities in Armenian Highlands (Eastern Turkey + Armenia) culturally and genetically - Hurrians, Hittites, Urartians, Caucasus tribes like Udis, etc. This assimilation happened before recorded history: by the time first Greek geographers passed through the Armenian highland 25 centuries ago, they wrote about one ethnicity of Armenians instead of those constituent components.",t5_2qo29,False,FlagofArmeniasmall,1462147965,t3_4h8xpb,t3_4h8xpb,0,3,d2p0or5,Armenia,wise_man_of_mount_ny

You may be reasonable, but there is no excuses for the single largest pro-trump forum on the internet to decide one day to just be as racist as fucking possible and then get to claim innocence. That is absurd.

That is the reality. Trump has a history of being sued by the government for civil rights violations in the 70s.

He proposes war crimes, declaring he would order our brave men and women in the armed forces to target families and civilians for slaughter because their relatives might be enemy combatants.

He provokes his supporters to respond with violence, that he will protect them from due process of law with his power if need be.

On top of all of this, he has no real policies to speak of. No experience in diplomacy, no idea how world politics works, no qualifications for office at all besides being entertaining.

Des beaux quartiers aux mondes plus interlopes : Arnaud Mimran est un homme qui ne manque pas de connexions. Il dispose même d’un carnet d’adresses sans frontières : France, Israël, Italie.

&gt;Son nom est également évoqué dans trois affaires de meurtres toujours non résolues : celui de Samy Souied, présenté comme le caïd des hippodromes assassiné en septembre 2010 à Porte Maillot, celui de Claude Dray, le père de l’ex-femme de Mimra taille de son appartement du 16e – ""400 m² sur deux niveaux avec une piscine intérieure"" – ; la présence ""bien entendu payante"" d'un casting de rêve (le rappeur P.Diddy, le mannequin Bar Refaeli ou la star planétaire Pharell an, un riche homme d’affaires assassiné en octobre 2011 dans sa villa de Neuilly-sur-Seine et enfin celui en mai 2014 d’Albert Taïeb, chauffeur et factotum de Cyril Mouly, un joueur de poker bien connu ayant eu des démêlées avec la justice pour des affaires d’arnaques aux encarts publicitaires

&gt;Photos à l’appui, Mediapart révèle que l’intéressé ne manque pas d’entregent. Commençons par les politiques. Ancien associé au sein  de la société ETC Agencement de Pierre Botton, le gendre et soutien de l’ancien maire de Lyon, Michel Noir, Arnaud Mimran entretiendrait également des ""liens forts"" avec Meyer Habib, le député UDI

&gt;Proche de l’actuel premier ministre israélien, le député UDI aurait-il présenté le golden boy à Benjamin Netanyahou ? Les deux hommes se connaissent. D’après plusieurs témoignages concordants, la famille a aidé le parti Likoud et prêté au début des années 2000 son appartement de l’avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris XVIe) à Netanyahou

&gt;Mais ce n’est pas tout. Selon nos informations, l’intéressé serait également proche du frère d’un intime du président de la République et membre du PS

&gt;Quant à l’un des partenaires de Mimran dans l’escroquerie à la taxe carbone, Marco Mouly, il aurait fait en 2012 un prêt de 4 millions d’euros à Thierry Leyne, l’ancien associé de DSK

&gt;Enfin, selon Mediapart, Mimran disposerait aussi de contacts dans la police. Dans l’une de ses auditions, ce dernier se serait même targué de connaître un certain ""Seb"" qu’il présente comme un policier de la DGSI

http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/justice/20160303.OBS5792/nouvelles-revelations-sur-arnaud-mimran-le-golden-boy-en-eaux-troubles.html

&gt;* Déjà mis en examen dans l’escroquerie à la taxe carbone, Arnaud Mimran est soupçonné d’avoir commandité en  l’enlèvement d’un banquier suisse résidant à Dubaï pour lui faire acheter, sous la menace, des titres d’une société dont il était propriétaire.

&gt;* Farid Khider, six fois champion du monde de boxe, a lui aussi été mis en garde à vue, dans cette affaire.

&gt;* Le nom d’Arnaud Mimran enfin, revient encore dans plusieurs dossiers d'assassinats à commencer par celui de Samy Souied en septembre 2010, abattu Porte Maillot en sa présence. L’homme d’affaires était l'une des rares personnes à être au courant du passage de Samy Souied à Paris. 

&gt;* Selon le rapport des douanes, Souied aurait confié à Arnaud Mimran à l'été 2010 entre 20 et 50 millions d'euros en cash dans le but de réaliser un investissement boursier. ""Cet investissement n'aurait finalement pas eu lieu et, incapable de rembourser Souied, Mimran l'aurait fait assassiner. Les investigations réalisées dans la présente procédure, nuance ce même rapport des douanes, ne sont pas à ce jour suffisantes pour confirmer ou infirmer cette thèse.""

&gt;* Autre meurtre, en avril 2014, le garde du corps de Cyril Mouly, escroc d’envergure en litige avec Arnaud Mimran, a été tué à coups de couteaux par deux inconnus dans un guet-apens dont Cyril Mouly était, selon toute vraisemblance, la cible principale. 

&gt;* Le nom de Arnaud Mimran est également apparu dans le cadre de l'enquête sur l'assassinat du richissime homme d'affaires Claude Dray, son ex-beau-père, en octobre 2011 où aucune trace d'effraction n'avait été relevée dans l'hôtel particulier de Neuilly.  Un crime digne de la chambre jaune car il n'existe aucune trace d'effraction.

&gt;* Pour un contribuable qui déclare 45.000 euros de revenus annuels entre 2010 et 2012, le rapport des douanes le rapport des douanes se plaît à souligner la taille de son appartement du 16e – ""400 m² sur deux niveaux avec une piscine intérieure"" – ; la présence ""bien entendu payante"" d'un casting de rêve (le rappeur P.Diddy, le mannequin Bar Refaeli ou la star planétaire Pharell Williams) pour la bar-mitsva de son fils en novembre 2012 ; ou encore son goût prononcé pour le poker – plus de 3 millions d'euros engagés dans des casinos américains entre décembre 2009 et janvier 2012…

If I were to edge either way I would say the sword probably has the edge as it is more likely in that period that someone with a sword is more likely to be of higher birth and therefore better trained, better fed and probably with more self belief in their ability to fight. That though of course is NOT directly due to the sword being a 'better' weapon.

The Sadducees and the Pharisees were sociopolitical classes of Jews. Modern day Jews are descendent of those Jews. What even does this mean? 

&gt; And so why should we care? 

You shouldn't really care about how Jews identify themselves or if they choose to express their national aspirations. That's his point.

&gt;  Europeans tend to think in universal terms, Jews, not so much.

Not sure what this even means.

&gt; If nationalism is appropriate for Jews, then it should be for non-Jews, right?

Nationalism is appropriate for all peoples. All peoples are entitled to self-determination. Zionism is Jewish nationalism. It is not Jews' responsibility to specifically promote or defend European nationalism.

&gt; Jews in the USA are massively in favor of Jews having their own state 

Jews in the USA who are for Jews having a state but are against nationalism for Europe and the USA hold internally inconsistent values just like all Leftists.

1- On obligerait les cyclistes à circuler dans un endroit restreint où se trouvent des regards (bouches d'égout) et où l'eau s'accumule les jours de pluie.

2- Les cyclistes seraient encore plus vulnérables à l'emportiérage, étant pris dans un étroit corridor entre les voitures et le trottoir, ne pouvant éviter une portière s'ouvrant en la contournant. Il faudrait avoir un espace tampon entre les voitures et la piste cyclable, ce qui demande encore plus d'espace de chaussée, espace qui peut souvent manquer.
http://i67.tinypic.com/1gjeiq.jpg

3- La visibilité entre les cyclistes et les conducteurs conduisant dans la voie de circulation serait réduite par la présence des voitures stationnées, ce qui peut causer des problèmes avec des entrées charretières, car les véhicules pourraient s'engager vers celles-ci et couper les cyclistes:
http://i63.tinypic.com/2qsmdxg.jpg

En Europe, quand les pistes cyclables sont à l'extérieur du stationnement sur rue, en général celles-ci sont au même niveau que le trottoir, et non dans la rue.

Personnellement, je suis un hérétique parce que je crois que le Japon est plus civilisé que nous à cet égard en interdisant le stationnement sur rue presque partout. La voie publique ne devrait pas être un lieu de remisage pour propriété privée (voiture). C'est merveilleux de se promener au Japon et de ne voir pratiquement aucune voiture stationnée sur rue, c'est très plaisant, les rues ne sont pas encombrées de voitures en permanence.

&gt;La solution qui saute en pleine face est de mettre initialement des flèches vertes qui permettent au véhicules d'au moins aller tout droit pendant que les piétons (dans le sens du trafic) traversent et seulement les véhicules qui tournent (qui sont moins nombreux) doivent attendre.

Ce n'est pas toujours possible, par exemple, quand il n'y a pas de voie réservée pour les virages à droite. On ne peut pas donner 30 secondes de flèche tout droit avec une voie où des voitures continuant tout droit coexistent avec des voitures tournant à droite. 

&gt;Parlant de design stupide... Une chose qu'il faudrait régler dès demain matin et qui est d'une renversante condescendance et qui empire le trafic et la pollution, c'est le fait que sur l'île de Montréal on ne peut pas tourner à droite sur la rouge—une des rares places en amérique du nord où on doit perdre son temps ainsi.

Là, je suis en désaccord complet. Le seul autre endroit en Amérique du Nord où ce mouvement est largement interdit est New York. Le problème du virage à droite sur feu rouge est que les conducteurs voulant faire ce mouvement regardent à gauche pour s'assurer d'avoir un créneau alors qu'ils s'engagent à droite, de plus, ils vont souvent s'avancer pour avoir une meilleure visibilité, le tout fait en sorte que les véhicules empiètent sur des traverses piétonnes et cyclistes et augmentent les probabilités d'accident piéton ou cycliste.

À mon avis, on devrait favoriser l'approche européenne: interdire le virage à droite sur le feu rouge SAUF là où il est expressément permis, plutôt que l'approche américaine de le permettre sauf là où il est expressément interdit.",t5_2qhh9,False,,1462154119,t1_d2p1lkc,t3_4halno,0,7,d2p4mob,,kchoze

If you want to adopt a child, your home can not be the same as when you were alone. It can be done but there is a price and countries where immigration have been epitomized as inherently good will have to be consistent with such claims or change their philosophy/ideology to reconsider if such thing is always true. 

Europe suffered quite a trauma due to their religious wars that ravaged the continent during the Protestant Reformation. This gave way to notion that religion was, indeed, a force of divide, pain and unrest so *humanism*, a secular philosophy that put emphasis on humans began to form. Slowly but steadily, humanism became a good pragmatic key to avoid religious hatred and confrontation and therefore began to influence governments' ideals. This process was not similar in all countries and not even in all the regions of some countries. A prime example of confrontation of those concepts is the U.S.A. where you had support for biblical-slavery religious model and ""we are all humans"" abolitionist humanist side (though to be fair, the word humanism was rather avoided for ""true Christian"" etc, as that is the better proselytizing policy). 

You could say that many places of the Muslim world is right now is in the middle of those bloody religious wars. Technology, communication, migration and the influence of those who migrated *could* (conditional) give way to some speeding up of the process. One that can include some ""*Islamic version*"" of the Western secular humanism (humanism itself often times is rejected as it reminds them of the ""corrupt, conniving, power thirsty"" West). Of course (and if it follows the same process) at first it will be (as it is *attempted* right now) ""Real Islam is peaceful"" claim. Sadly, those of us in the West that could point to the *literal* reality of the Quran, as well as those in Islam that use literality as well to justify their atrocities (atrocities under a humanist view), conspire (whether knowingly or not) against this ""re-interpretation"" religious process, one that occurred in the West several centuries ago. Right now would be delusional for Muslim countries not exposed to secularism to adopt it overnight (even if you try it by force, there will be a backlash, a **generations** are needed to slowly change from one attitude to some more secularized). Humans are also animals of habit and some habits only disappear with those who hold them (racism didn't disappear in the States after the south was defeated). 

Migrants to the West can assimilate given certain conditions that are not yet set. If you allow migrants to form their own mini-states, countries within the countries they come into, by isolating themselves in the places they migrated to (and this is normal in migrants and the more the numbers, the more they tend to group together) assimilation does not occur or is so slow that the end result is that they rather change the country the migrated instead of adopting the countries' values. Education is defeated if you allow their own ""proper version of education"" (religious education, with their schools, that sometimes overrides whatever that is intended locally) and as you already allowed this capacity to local religions (though the local religions already have transitioned, in general, into adopting secular values) it's complicated to make changes (as your own religious people would oppose). And the list goes on and on. That's why before adopting a child (following my initial metaphor) you have to consider if you are willing to change. Sometimes the adoptee is model child. Sometimes, due to the traumas of his personal history, the child is quite a headache. This doesn't mean you can not, it means that lying about this won't do any good, even if the intention is empathic or good.

Here's the way I see it as someone who has travelled extensively in Mexico and both worked with and lived around Mexicans in the US:


(1) Most legal Mexican immigrants will completely assimilate within three generations. Many of these are Mexicans with significant European descent, like many from Sonora, Chihuahua, or the Tapatios from Guadalajara. They want their kids to learn English and succeed. They are Christians. They want to work and start businesses. There are a lot like this in TX, and the gulf South.


 (2) There are some who came illegally, or are the children of illegals. Their parents were illiterate in Spanish, or spoke an Indian dialect (Mixtec, Nahuatl, whatever). So they inherit some shitty Spanish, and they make a half ass effort in school and fuck up in English too. They are often on the Indian end of the mestizaje spectrum, so they don't feel they fit in here racially. Blacks fuck with them, they start gangs to protect themselves, pretty soon their gangs are doing all the same fucked up shit the blacks are. This is a model for Mexican immigration more common in CA.

It is important to see these groups for what they are. Mexico is a mix, racially, linguistically, with religion and culture. Some immigrants (legal) ones, will improve our country. But some, many illegal, are shitty opportunists. And surprise, surprise, their American citizen children turn out the same.

-no caso de veículos feito a Economist, NYT e Washington Post , muito foi escrito sobre o assunto, e o mais honesto é, de saída, reconhecer  1) a evolução da cobertura sobre o tema, 2) separar o que é opinião do que é reportagem e, principalmente, 3) destacar os diversos aspectos que são mencionados-- não são textos panfletários ou preto e branco; o editorial do WP, p.ex., menciona que, na ausência de novas eleições, ""Latin America’s biggest power may be doomed to spend the next couple of years mired in recession and domestic conflict. **It’s a high price to pay for the rule of law — but so far, that is the one area where Brazil is getting stronger**""; 

-não existe vergonha nenhuma na correção de rumos e no olhar crítico sobre esse momento da história brasileira; vergonha seria fingir que está tudo bem e esconde-lo debaixo do tapete;

-o feedback jornalístico de fora do Brasil é importante mas não é completo; em particular, a escassez de comentários sobre os textos que embasaram esse processo (as peças acusatórias, a legislação sobre o impeachment, as provisões  constitucionais sobre o papel do Presidente e do Vice no Brasil etc)  indicam que a imprensa estrangeira está digerindo o tema gradativamente e se informando melhor. E ainda assim, algo continua verdadeiro desde o início: são inverídicas as tentativas de dizer que a imprensa estrangeira considera ""golpe"" o que acontece hoje, ou tenha tentado absolver Dilma só porque não haveria acusações contra a ""honestidade"" dela, o que não deixa de ser contraditório porque governantes honestos não cometem irregularidades fiscais extensas feito as que ela praticou.

1. I've criticized Sanders for his statements several times, and I'm less supportive of him than I was previously. So I'm not ""perfectly fine"" with him. 

2. You're making a lot of assumptions about this author. Wouldn't want to share a cattle cart with either of us? Really?

&gt;You and many other American Jews here are 'useful idiots' that will soon no longer serve any purpose to the increasingly regressive left. Don't buy into the victim game; after all we're only victims when it is politically expedient for us to be as per the aims of the left - and so we hear about this relatively trivial incident and very little about the recent suicide attack in Israel, and so we are not outraged when our president refuses to call a kosher supermarket attack anti-Semitic. 

Um, no. I'm extremely pro-Israel, and I'm often discussing, both online and in person, the situation going on in Israel, as well as rising violent antisemitism in Europe. So if you think I'm only focused on American issues, you're wrong. 

And I'm very critical of certain politicians on the left, including Obama when it comes to Israel.

Might I suggest that you point out Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino because compared to the Netherlands these areas are very small. [Also when you say ""every country"" you seem to mean every country *in Europe*]. You are able to see that regional differences *do* exist in some of Europe but that they *shouldn't* exist in the US [at least according to the Wiki source you cite]. 

Now let me suggest that as the US is **236 times larger** than the Netherlands that those areas like Liechtenstein would also be more prevalent and perhaps larger in the US. Also, Regional differences in language and culture have a lot to do with geography. The natural barriers that define regions in Europe are not largely different than in the US, but because of the SIZE difference they are more frequent. 

Now Let me **also** suggest that if there were large populations of, let's say, Latvians in both Groningen and Middleburg you might not be surprised that they had similar accents/dialects even though they were far away [by European standards but very close in US terms].

I am trying to point out that the US is very large geographically but perhaps small culturally as music, language, culture, literature is easily and instantly translated across the whole continent via radio, television and the internet over a few decades compared to much longer in Europe.

Europeans almost universally don't have such double standards and that's a fact (there is often a comparison of sexual mores between Europe and the US, including nudity on TV, nude sunbathing, etc).

&gt; LVG had stated the objective of the season as going further in the CL and challenging for the Premier league title. But sure, compete for all titles.

We were discussing the boards expectations. Stop changing the argument, again.

&gt; I did you a favor and helped you out. 4 games we lost over December period. 2 we tied - West Ham and Chelsea. Both reasonable. Loads of chances created in both, poor finishing.
4 losses
December 8 vs Wolfsburg - Varela starting his first senior game. Darmian at LB. Darmian gets injured and sees CBJ make his European debut before the half. 2 inexperienced FB's in a team that heavily relies on FBs. Nevertheless, we played well. Lingard's incorrectly disqualified goal at half could have changed the game. But whatever.
December 12 vs Bournemouth - Blind is the only senior CB. Lingard gets hurt in the 31st minute and replaced by Pereira.
December 19 vs Norwich - Phil Jones starts at CB for with Blind playing LB. 2 goals both Jones's fault.
December 26 vs Stoke - Phil Jones again at CB with Blind and Young at FB. Memphis careless header to DDG leads to first goal. We were poor going forward.

This is honestly just a load of waffle without making any point. You've just recapped the games. What's you're point? Are you able to comprehend what refuting a point is? You've literally said nothing of value... 

CBJ / Varela both did better than Rojo and Darmian were doing, and were better going forward. Invalid argument. 

Phil Jones has been with the club for years and started ahead of Blind several times. If he's not good enough to play LVG should have moved him on. Not a valid excuse. 

Every team has injuries and has to play players that aren't first choice. Discounting an entire month because of injuries is not a valid excuse. It will likely happen again next year.

&gt; Rooney was out for the entire December.

He was absolute crap before he got injured anyway. Not a valid excuse.

&gt; What did I make up?

Our seasons objectives as stated by the board.

&gt; Does any team go into a season with no intention of challenging for every possible trophy? 

Not every team's expectation is to challenge for every trophy. Last season the expectation was to get back into champions league. Christ you are awful at this whole debating thing.

&gt; In that case every season we've made out with only 1 trophy is a failure. By your logic at least. That's just stupid.

Nope. What an ignorant and uninformed assumption. I've explained to you several times why I think we've regressed and why we are worse this season, across several threads. The fact you keep ignoring this is pretty funny. But sure, cherry pick to argue with your straw man. You seem to do it with everyone. Usually a sign of a weak argument.

Right mate, bed time for me, no point wasting any more time on you. It's really disappointing that you seemingly spend all day here rehashing the same arguments day in day out, paragraphs long, and still cherry pick, twist peoples words and refute any valid points that don't align with your narrative.

Very well meaning, very earnest, but also, just really short-sighted and generally, the younger ones are a-historical.

I had three conversations with Sen. Sanders youngest supporters that terrified me in a very general way:

1.  One informed me that socialism has never really been tried, and the European vein of it is not a model because it's infected with internationalism, the EU, and capitalist elements that make it unpalatable.  I'd estimate age was 24-26, white, identifies as female.  Had a degree from Barnard College in Human Rights and Urban Studies.

2.  One informed me that ""helicoptering money"" is something that should be examined, and cited Hunger Games as a model of the way that the distribution could be handled (not the violence part, just the selection process).  This discussion led to some chat about how the problem with the Soviet Union was that when East Germany left it's sphere of influence the Soviet economy could not absorb the economic loss, and that Gorbechev was bribed by the West to dissolve the union.  Then the first Pres. Bush arranged to auction off the economic assets of the old USSR to the highest bidder.  He further stated that Russian President Putin was installed as dictator by Pres. Clinton after Yeltsin left office.  He believes Gorbachev was blackmailed by Pres. Bush to step down.  This person admitted that much of what he knew about that period in history came from reading ""Time Magazine for Kids"".  He had a BA from NYU in Political Science and was considering going for a masters until ""Bernie could fix the economy"".  The potential cost of a private school masters degree didn't bother him because ""everyone knows that those student loans will never have to be repaid"".

3.  One informed that me that Sec. Clinton was not a good choice for President because she was objectively evil.  We were not able to come to agreement on what the word ""objectively"" means, since she believed that it meant ""object"" as in ""objection"" to something disagreeable, like in Court.  I explained that in this context the word meant it's first meaning, but we could not resolve the dispute.  I was chastised that declaring what words meant or did not mean was an act of linguistic violence, and one that spread pro-White anti-Black message.

I find that so interesting. I imagine the market in The Netherlands (and elsewhere in Europe) is quite different than it is here in the US. Reminds me of my in-laws that sell vintage costume jewelry. It sells well here, but when England and Russia were doing better, buyers there would pay outrageous prices because you simply can't find the stuff there.

I live in a decent sized town, but I'm limited as far as item selection for clothing.

3,False,SargonofAkkad,,0,1465575805,"My notes on watching: 

Diversity IS a benefit. The problem comes in when diversity is considered an objective, rather than a natural consequence of people from disparate backgrounds interacting with each other. This doesn't just go for racial or ethnic diversity, but for political, religious and ideological diversity as well. My 8th grade social studies teacher said that if we remembered nothing else from his class, we should recognize the importance of cultural diffusion. That is, the spread of ideas between different cultures, whether through conflict, cooperation, or mere coexistence. 

The kin selection segment is a bit odd to me. The video makes a weird jump from kin meaning direct relations to traditional nation-states (where everyone's descendants were from the same geographical region), to the supposed ethnocentrism of the US, Canada, and Australia where ""kin"" means your ancestors came from the same continent. This strikes me as equivocation. Especially since, in the US, discrimination based on European nation of origin was common until the early 20th century. The idea of a ""white"" identity seems way too similar to the unified ""Christian"" identity that didn't exist until it was politically useful to unite the religious denominations against legal abortion. 

Just because it's worked for centuries and provided benefits to society doesn't mean that it's good or moral. Note that the video only says this about the subjugation of black people, but doesn't mention slavery. Also, the quote about ""what worked"" vs what ""sounded nice"" became irrelevant the moment that the system stopped working. And it stopped working because black people stopped allowing the system to work. 

The ""Evolutionary Dominance of Ethnocentric Cooperation"" segment is interesting. One might assume that it means that everyone has to look and think exactly the same, but ""Ethnocentrism"" only selected based on a single trait - agreeing to work as a group towards a common goal. And humans are great at working together against a common threat, even with people who they might normally dislike or think inferior. As before, the video depends on shifting meanings of ""ethnocentrism,"" where it could mean ""black people vs white people"" in one instance and ""American vs German"" in another. 

As an example, most Americans spoke German as their first language until WWI. Most Americans at the time shared an ethnicity, language, and some degree of culture with Germans in WWI, but it was the rest of their culture that disagreed. And while the Italians in the US fought the Nazis, the Italians in Italy were their allies.

It also wouldn't help differentiate this film from Episode VII - which I think they're going to be very conscious of given the fact that both films have a British Female lead. Us fans might know the difference, but to your average passive moviegoer who's first SW film was TFA, there will no doubt be some confusion. They've made a point before of how many different stories there are to tell in the Star Wars universe and how much variety it allows them as filmmakers, and to shoehorn these extra new elements into a film that's already trying really hard to recreate the feel of ANH seems a bit messy to me.

I totally get your comparison to Marvel, but I think the Star Wars films are going to work a little differently to how Marvel have set up the MCU. In the MCU, the Avengers films are like tentpoles for all the other various hero films (and TV shows), which come in phases and build up a story that culminates with an Avengers every few years.

With Star Wars however, the ""Episode"" films are an independent story and up until December this year have been the only Star Wars films - they've lived as their own saga. Yes, we've had the EU and the other spinoff stuff, but none of it really feeds into the film saga the way The Avengers does. Add to this the fact that the ""A Star Wars Story"" subtitle was clearly created to differentiate these anthology films further from the Skywalker saga, and the only reason I could possibly think of them putting Snoke in would be fan service.

...Except it's not TFA fans this film is trying to serve, it's fans of ANH.

&gt; NXP’s Mifare NXP’s family of Mifare card and reader ICs is built on the ISO 14443 Type A standard. Mifare cards support multiple applications, each capable of operating independently of the others through user definable key sets and access conditions. Readers are capable of reading any variety of Mifare card, and NXP certifies both cards and readers to ensure compatibility across generations. According to Martin Gruber, segment director for the Transit Team at NXP, Mifare is the “overall umbrella brand” for a portfolio of products. Mifare Classic is the original NXP product that was introduced in 1995-96 when the 14443 standard was first released. Mifare Plus was launched in 2009 and features higher security than Mifare Classic. DESfire is the newest and most advanced product, providing the highest level of security and flexibility.

&gt; Sony’s FeliCa could be the most varied of the contactless flavors, complying with a different ISO standard. To date it has seen the majority of its use in Asian markets, but the notion that it is only relevant in Asia is an image Sony is trying to correct. FeliCa was introduced in Hong Kong in 1997, says Jun Shionozaki, technical consulting manager for FeliCa Business Division at Sony. It was introduced to the Japanese market in 2001. “It’s deployed in other parts of Asia, Europe and the U.S.,” says Shionozaki. FeliCa has an extremely strong presence in Japan because of the maturity of the country’s mobile market. As of June 2010, 67 million Japanese handsets embedded with mobile FeliCa chips were in circulation, says Shionozaki. FeliCa is based on the ISO 18902 standard that defines near field communication. “We decided to focus on the 18092 standard which covers a wide range, including mobile,” says Shionozaki. Some aspects of the FeliCa system are open. “We comply with 18092, in that sense we can be considered open,” says Shionozaki. FeliCa uses encryption algorithms that are open standard as well, but it maintains a set of proprietary security elements. Sony says its FeliCa card is the first contactless card to achieve EA4L security. “It’s the highest level for consumer products,” says Shionozaki.",t5_2qkob,False,,1462170580,t1_d2pd8hh,t3_4hevxc,0,3,d2pdcmy,views here ≠ employer's,beaugiles

Every other time I've seen them is at the UNSW Roundhouse also in Sydney, and in my opinion it's a terrible venue and they don't sound good at all there.

- Orange County (specifically south Orange County close to Irvine, Lake Forest, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Dana Point) is an amazing pace to stay for a year. Its half way between LA and San Diego which are amazing places to visit. Its close to the beach. Its a couple of hours to the desert (Palm Springs) and mountains (Big Bear or Wrightwood), and abotu 4.5 hours from Vegas and 8 hours from San Francisco (all driving times). 
- Its incredibly safe, with all areas of each city safe to roam in (this is unlike a lot of the US where all the poor people in a city are put in one area and that becomes a crime/gang hotspot). Southern OC is not like this.  
- it has a lot of trees, nature, bike trails, creeks, rivers, walking trails and ocean based activities (boating, kayaking, SUP, surfing, fishing, whale watching) etc.  
- if you have to pay to live here, housing is very expensive, food is quite expensive, everything else is very cheap. If you are being hosted this wont matter much to you.  
- arguably (and I have travelled a lot) it is the best place in the USA to live, based on the weather, the people, the activities etc.  
- cons - occasionally we get minor earthquakes, which (on average) is like someone shaking you to wake you up from sleeping for 30 seconds.  We have a drought but mostly that is BS - theres lots of water you just have to pay more for it. In reality we have a infrastructure problem delivering water from northern CA to southern CA totally caused by the state government, and in practical terms it does not affect us day to day. You cannot always walk from A to B (too far) and you used to need a car, but now we have UBER which makes this con irrelevant any more as long as you can afford the low-cost fares.  Another con is you are in America which means you have to adapt to all the little cultural items from nightly gang killings in LA, to car chases being the most important news, to sex/violence differing standards to Europe (in usa its more violence and less sex), etc.  

In summary, do it you will love it. Maybe you should try to do it yourself privately instead of using an agency. Your brother is right some agencies just want your money so review them carefully. Sometimes it is just better to control your own destiny. There are many legal ways to get a student visa or J/B visa to come here.

So you're telling me that Nazis were socialists.... but they *murdered* communists, socialists and even social democrats. Are you really this ignorant to not know that Nazis persecuted and killed anti-capitalists? Also, you realize that the Nazis *invaded* the USSR, right?? Socialist countries aren't supposed to be imperialist, and they sure as hell don't invade other socialist countries.     

&gt;supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries    

US has nationalized land and industries. Is the US socialist?    

&gt;Various work programs designed to establish full-employment    

This happened in the US under FDR. Socialist????    

&gt;the Nazis also promised social policies like a national labour service, state-provided health care, guaranteed pensions    

Guess who else has these policies? US, Canada, UK, and many other European countries. I guess they're all socialist, right?    

&gt;The Nazis sought to gain support of workers by declaring May Day, a day celebrated by organised labour    

See above. Nazis literally killed union members. So much for loving organized labor.     

&gt;You call me ignorant, and yet you believe that the Nazis were capitalists?     

Based on everything above, you can't still claim that Nazis were anti-capitalism. Seriously, they killed communists for being communist. It's a well-known fact that [Nazis were capitalist](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/04/capitalism-and-nazism/), if you care to read about their economic system. 

""In the mid-1930s, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in western capitalistic countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s.""     

Privatization! You're a neoliberal, so you should know that privatization is very capitalist.      

Socialism is worker control of the means of production. Not nationalized industries or privatization or killing union members. Worker control of the means of production. Nazi Germany never had this. They were never socialist. In fact they did plenty of things which were obviously capitalist (wage labor, privatization, accumulation of capital, imperialism). Literally your only argument thus far has been ""they called themselves socialists"" and ""they had all these social programs."" You probably think Bernie Sanders is a socialist lmao    

&gt;you ignored my source, which unequivocally stated that Mao was the biggest mass murder in history by a long shot.     

You're ignoring the math. 45 million + 7 million is barely 52 million. The Soviet Union lost 20 million to the Nazis alone. Add on the +10 million who died in the Holocaust, plus 15 million Congolese killed by Belgium, 10 million Indians by the British, millions of Natives and tens of millions of slaves by the US, and of course millions more civilians died in the ""War on Terror,"" Vietnam and Operation Condor.

Man City making money available to Guardiola to buy 'superstars' will not prevent him from promoting young talent into the first team, he has had money to spend at his previous clubs and has still brought young players in.

Again, Patrick Roberts will play for Celtic next season, so he will obviously not be in Manchester City's Champions League squad.

The problem with the US regulatory process, according to Aviv, is that corporations have been conducting what she disparagingly calls a “sound science campaign.” At the heart of this campaign is the “Data Quality Act,” passed in 2000, requiring that regulations rely on studies that meet high standards for “quality, objectivity, utility and integrity.” According to Aviv, this is all part of a nefarious conspiracy on the part of industry to “delay regulation by kind of picking apart the science that would be used to support the regulation.” … Of course, what Aviv would call ‘picking apart the science,’ academics and researchers call the scientific method. “Picking apart” studies to see if they are replicable is how science is supposed to work. If science isn’t falsifiable, it is simply opinion or speculation.

Yeah, the more I thought on that the more I realized I was wrong. The design dungeons definitely seem to have some sort of finesse involved. I can't help but struggle to shake away the feeling of primitiveness (that's a word?!) about the Pthumerians. Perhaps it's just my mind having a hard time processing the fact that I've been wrong all this time.

&gt; Undead Giants and Merciless watchers do have firearms.

It does seem weird, then, that gunpowder isn't utilized more by the Ptumerians (or the ones that are left). Especially since we can then infer that gunpowder was a commoner's technology of choice, since the higher up in the hierarchy you go, the more sorcery is used. 

Come to think of it that makes sense. A civilization that had successfully made contact would definitely 'protect' what they learn to the upper echelons of their society.

&gt; Then another couple of Pthumerian generations later...

You see, this still just doesn't sit right with me. If the Yharnamites were in fact Pthumerian descendants, then why would there be no reference to it, even a suggestion? The only thing the Yharnamites say of Pthumeria, is that it's an ancient civilization that had successfully made contact. I feel like the people of Yharnam would be more aware of the fact that they are Pthumerians. In fact, it would be almost unavoidable to come across as a foreigner. The fact that the society had successfully risen up from it's own ashes would bring about such a huge amount of national pride, I'm imagining close to neo-Nazi levels. 
We would be dealing with a society that had made contact with gods, been destroyed, and risen up to make contact with gods again. That is no small feat. How would it be that something so impressive wouldn't be a part of the city's ""national"" identity? (Perhaps I'm thinking too much into this).

That's an extremely nice way of thinking about it. The dungeons could work almost like a time-travel machine. The ""deeper"" you go, the older the timeline. I think you're definitely correct in looking at it that way, and at least without my own research, it seems like you go it spot on with that ""timeline"". What your timeline made me consider however, is if the Giants ever show up as bosses in the deeper dungeons. If not, then perhaps we can argue they they are the Ptumerians' equivalent of Living Failures - their unsuccessful attempts at transcendence. These Giants (lore-wire), really don't make much sense. They are larger than the Pthumerians (who are borderline giants, or at least the best NBA players we'd know), and definitely seem to lack whatever intellect the Pthumerians do. 

This would reinforce the theme of irony in the game, as the Yharnam had committed the exact same mistakes as Pthumeria - almost one for one. 

&gt; normal Labyrinth enemies who have melee weapons imbued with fire magic.

Perhaps we can have a look at whether those dungeons levels have Labyrinth Ritekeepers or not. It's a cop-out, but if they do, we can attributed any buffs to them. They tend to buff the mob enemies with poison damage, why not fire?

&gt; there was definitely some shady deals going down in Old Yharnam.

I don't think we can argue that as a certainty. To me, Old Yharnam really seems to be like a continuation of the irony theme we've addressed. It's almost like Yharnam had already seen its ruination, but to a much lesser, contained degree. This would be the warning shot in a battle. They were lucky enough that the city was built in a more ""traditional"" sense, with the important parts on a  more elevated level, similar to how most hilly-European cities tend to have their cathedral/fort on their highest point. I almost imagine the burning of Old Yharnam as an event that the upper-class regretted simply because they needed to build Central Yharnam, which made the peasants closer. 
The reason why I don't think that there was *definitely* some shady shit going down is because of the lore note you find there - ""...Are we left no other choice, than burn it all to cinders?""
This note suggests regret and sadness.
Of course, if the note is written by a Powderkeg (it is found by one of their bodies, isn't it?), then he could be one of the Powerkegs that followed Djura's line of thought...i don't know, just spit-balling here.

&gt; The very few non-Church humans we meet are the ones we can send to Oedon Chapel.

Maybe we count them differently, but I would consider the old woman, the grump old man (the paranoid one), as well as the beggar and Arianna all ""non-Church members"". Arianna is definitely special, but her connection is to Cainhurst or Pthumeru (directly). Of the ones you send to the Chapel, only Adella is Church-related (and the most despicable). To me, this suggests that most of the characters are just regular folk, not Chuch-related. I find this important, since the Chapel is another part of the game that enforced the tragedy that takes place to people during the Hunt (almost all experience pretty tragic ends). 

But I see what you mean, since the majority of the game does deal with Church members. 

&gt; Gilbert 

The more I think about Gilbert, the more I like his role in the game. If he is related to the Church, then he serves the purpose of reminding us that not everyone in the Church is a grey or black on the spectrum of morality.

&gt; The old woman made me wonder how ""outsiders"" were responsible for the current state of Yharnam.

To me, the old lady's dialogue was meant to reinforce the xenophobia only, but your spin with your PthumYharnam Theory (official name) actually fits. That is, if the theory can be bought ;). 

I would take her dialogue more seriously with your theory, however, if she wasn't just one of many Yharnamites that say that. ""It's all your fault"" is a common phrase that you hear. So why should we consider her dialogue more interesting, and not just a continuation of the xenophobia? Blaming outsiders for your own issues is basically elementary xenophobia, anyway. What I'm trying to say is that I feel this is part of the confirmation bias (which I admit I'm using too much as a counter-argument, nonetheless valid here). 

Edit: Adding more to this in Part 2

&gt; Yurie seems to be the last Scholar of the Healing Church

In my playthrough, it was Iosefka. I killed Yurie but went back to the Forest to explore the cave and found my way to Iosefka, who died in glorious doggy position. Fuck me what an eerie moment in the game. 

&gt; Schism..Healing Church is against Cainhurst comes from the Executioner's Garb

We don't disagree with your point, however I always felt it was more a Yharnam vs Cainhurst (more xenophobia) as opposed to just the HC. 

I may be confused with the timeline, so correct me if I'm wrong - but I always assumed that the sacking of Cainhurst happened way before the Hunt. It was a part of the mor recent history of the world. The issues took place not long after the forbidden blood was taken to Cainhurst by one of the hunters. This happened right when Willem was exploring the dungeons am I right? 

To me, the schism between the Yharnam (and so HC) and Cainhurst is more akin to a North-South Korea, or even Saudi-Iran. The two fictional cities battled decades ago, however are not in combat now, because there was a clear winner. Cainhurst is in ruins (and has been for a while), there are no more Cainhurts knights, save for a more recent converted Hunter of Hunters, and the story of Logarius is close to how we views Churchill or Roosevelt, a prominent figure of history. This further reinforces Alfred's lunacy/fanaticism - he's still obsessed with a battle that took place several decades ago (akin to some Muslim terrorists, or even the Serbs during the Yugoslav War). 

The more I interacted with Alfred in later playthroughs, the more I wanted to say ""dude, get over it. Build a fucking bridge and get over it"". What I'm trying to explain through my rambling, is that Alfred's issue with Cainhurst isn't a representation of the sentiments of all of Yharnam and HC, just his own (and maybe the Executioners') obsession. If FromSoft wanted to relay to us that the HC still had beef with Cainhurst, it would've made more sense to add a few HC Scholars there. It would've reinforced the sentiment that the HC has a hand in everything, and also been a smooth indicator to the PvP covenant in the area.

Kenneth Pomeranz, *The Great Divergence* (2000)

It's more something (as I understand) that economic historians argue about. Groups that look at demography, for example the 'California Group'. The so-called 'Financial Revolution' is a pretty important part of this debate, as the building up of banking and credit institutions is seen to have enabled expansive and dynamic Dutch and British trading empires in various centuries. 

To return to your question, they are completely and absolutely related- and too intertwined to argue causality, though some people have. I haven't studied this for years and undoubtedly there are more expert people. One part of the argument is the debate over the starting point of the industrial revolution. Some people- such as Belich- argue that the plague of the fourteenth century was key in kicking off the path that led Western Europe towards an indusrial revolution, rather than, say, China. 

Ultimately I'd say that the Industrial Revolution came first, if only because this had absolutely already happened by the time that Britain's became the largest empire. Remember that for centuries Britain's empire was smaller than that of the Iberian countries, the Dutch, the Chinese, The Ottomans...

Europe-based economist here, 

There's a problem with the implementation of  that. The problem is that in europe, a lot of what drives demand are proximity to events and to heritage sites. 

At some point, these are going to:

1. Require some sort of management. Cities that neglect this occasionally find people trying to tear down castles, city walls, and even Shakespeare's private home, for extremely short-term driven reasons. So, in order to preserve the original reason that people even want to live in a eurpean city (the 1000+ years of cultural heritage), some sort of micromanagement is often necessary. 

2. Berlin has ALREADY made lots of concessions in that area. Most parts of the wall are gone now to make way for new housing and business real estate. Considering that the wall is one of the major things that tourists want to see (and they pay good money to visit the city), there's a bit of a problem removing the last bits of it. By a similar token, I suppose that you COULD lower housing prices in Rome (which are outlandish), by demolishing the coliseum, the spanish steps, and st. peter's basilica, and replace all three with high-rise housing complexes in increase the supply of housing at the center of rome's most sought-after postal codes, but that would also have the effect of killing rome (as well as the demand to live there).  Nobody would ever forgive that. 

3. Berlin's housing prices have been cheap for the past 30 years largely because of the specific way that the events of 1989 went down. The wall came down, and the vast majority of East Berliners and Brandenburgers abandoned East Germany, in fear that the opening would be as temporary as the hungarian one in 1956 or the czechoslovak one in 1968. Those were one-time events whose economics effect was BOUND to wear off eventually. ",t5_2qh1s,False,,1462178991,t1_d2oqq8e,t3_4haa94,0,9,d2pfro5,,mberre

0,False,Divorce,,1,1465577449,"There is a narrative of the abused woman, which leads to divorces being completely devastating to fathers in many states, especially more liberal ones. While statistics indicate that both marital emotional abuse and physical violence occur at similar rates with male and female victims, you have centers for battered women, while battered men just get mocked. Based on that narrative, many states have created divorce laws which are designed to be punitive. 

Many men do the simple math: Staying in, there's a chance things will get better. Getting out, they'll be broken for the rest of their adult lives. They'll still send the majority of their income to their cheating ex, but they'll be living in poverty, and may or may not get to see their kids. They're not likely to be able to get into a functional relationship at age 40, living at sustenance levels. If they get out, the state will simply enforce the parasitic relationship. It's a choice between one broken life and another. 

There's a very nice book: http://www.realworlddivorce.com/

It's exceptionally well-researched and gives nice statistics. In countries with more balanced divorce laws -- most of Europe for example -- men in disfunctional relationships have much more ability to leave. 

I would suspect the story is similar for some women as well -- life after divorce would be worse than life in a broken marriage. I live in a liberal state, where women almost always come out ahead on divorce, but in conservative states, the levels of support are quite different.

The Nation-State is largely defunct in the West and the attempted imposition of Nation-States on what are recently Imperial provinces is in large-part a source of the modern Middle-Eastern conflicts.

1) The nation-state is not ""largely defunct"". I have yet to see any evidence of this. In fact, nations and states are becoming closer to one another, as attempts to fragment states to more closely resemble nations have been gaining steam (i.e. Catalan nation secession, Scotland secession, etc. gaining steam as movements). Indeed, nation-states are becoming more internally cohesive so much that transnational organizations are losing popularity right now, with the EU and NATO facing criticisms and skepticism.

2) The idea that conflict is a result of the imposition of nation-states on previously imperial provinces is without foundation. The problem is not necessarily this, it is that the states never built up infrastructural power to actually create a cohesive nation in the first place, so people have begun to revert more and more towards other identities as defining their ""nation"". Whereas in the US people are defined as a nation by being ""American"", there is no cohesive ""Iraqi"" identity, and no way to square many of the differences due to polarization, which may someday be the case in the US as well if the process continues in which case the US may also suffer from problems, though the state's deep infrastructural power will keep it far more stable. In the Middle East and other areas worldwide, the problem remains not that people had ""nation-states"" placed on them, but that nations never formed like they do in every other case. The US colonies formed a cohesive identity from a previously imperial province, it can be done.

&gt; The Nation-States that existed in the West developed over hundreds of years of bloodshed which wiped out both the people and the cultural signifiers of those who did not fit the 'national pattern'. Every time that there has been an attempt to impose a 'Nation-State' where one did not exist previously it has resulted in similar bloodshed, but compressed into decades rather than the course of hundreds of years.

The problem is the definition of nation-state and the need for states more generally. The alternatives are either an abolishing of the state system which would lead to a reversion to the ""state of nature"" and anarchy, neither of which really help much, or a unitary ""state"" that transcends nations and creates a single, new ""nation"" based on a unitary national identity, an idea that requires uniting people into a new nation-state regardless.

The problem isn't the attempt to impose a ""nation-state"" at all, in fact. The problem is what happens when nations fail to form within a state, or the state fails to adhere to the boundaries of nations. What we're seeing in the Middle East is not the imposition of ""nation-states"" on imperial provinces at all. We watched states be superimposed onto peoples without national identities, and then watched as their other identities formed into national ones that didn't conform to the borders. The problem is not the imposition of a ""nation-state"" because the nation never existed. It was just the imposition of ""states"" with little thought towards the nations.",t5_2qhqb,False,,1462181972,t1_d2pg0ny,t3_4h9oge,0,1,d2pgixl,,tayaravaknin

&gt; The campaign group said it would on Monday publish 248 pages of classified documents to &amp;quot;Shine a light&amp;quot; on negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an ambitious treaty both sides want completed by year-end but which is facing mounting opposition.

&gt; It says the cache - obtained by Greenpeace Netherlands - represents two-thirds of the TTIP draft text as of the latest round of talks in April, and covers a range of issues from telecoms to food and agriculture and trade barriers.

&gt; &amp;quot;These leaked documents confirm what we have been saying for a long time: TTIP would put corporations at the centre of policy-making, to the detriment of environment and public health,&amp;quot; said Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss.

1,False,IAmA,,0,1465577810,"&gt; The Mongol invasion can certainly be called that if we call the scouting party that ravished Europe an invasion. Koreans provided the ships.

An invasion that doesn't land can hardly be called an invasion. Otherwise napoleon and hitler both ""invaded"" britain.

Secondly, suggesting that this was an ""attack"" against japan by korea (or more accurately koryo) in order to excuse the invasions of joseon is laughable. It's like claiming that someone who jaywalks should be treated the same as a serial killer because they both committed ""crimes"".

&gt; I don't know if we can go as far as to say there was any invasion of Japan by Baekje. It has certainly been argued in the past, but there's no archaeological evidence.

There most certainly it, it's just that japanese historians refuse to interpret it the way it should be because it doesn't fit the outcome they'd like. The drastic change in burial practices, the sudden centralisation of the previously walled-towns, the sudden appearance of iron weapons/armour, the sudden appearance of horse-archery, etc all can't be explained without a change in what constituted the ""elites"".

The wholesale changes that occurred in japan, politically and culturally, were the analogue of what occurred in england post-norman invasion. In both cases the modern culture is a direct product of those events.

People celebrate Vappu in 1st of May, though the celebrations are always the day before (so in this case 30th of April) in Finland, so everyone has time to get better from their hangover before work. Vappu is a big thing for students who celebrate Vappu for the whole week, and for leftists as left-wing parades and such are held.

* [Juhannus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer#Finland)
Juhannus, or ""Ukon Juhla"" (Ukko's Celebration after the Finnish God Ukko) is the midsummer festival in Finland, the day the whole country seizes and Helsinki is almost empty since everyone leaves cities and go to countryside or summer houses. Basically people are burning huge bonfires and celebrating with the family - or in pop rock festivals if that's your thing. There are also lots of folk magic rituals that some people do for fun. So basically it's just eating and drinking. The amount of people drowned and killed in traffic accidents in Juhannus is always the head topic of the newspapers next week. That's Finland for you.

* Christmas
Basically the same as Christmas in other Northern European countries. 

* Independence Day, 6th of December
A national public holiday that includes traditions that seem never to change. Our national broadcasting company YLE shows ""Tuntematon Sotilas"" (An Unknown Soldier, [orig. written by Väinö Linna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_Soldier_%28novel%29)) and in the evening the Presidential Independence Day reception is held at the Presidential Palace for around 2000 guests (mostly politicians, notable people from sports, music, arts, and such).

2,False,Xcom,,0,1465578055,"Assuming you're thinking of **[Grimy's Highlander Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658305112)**, the problem with it is that in XCOM 2, most perks are more focused than in XCOM:EU/EW, to the point where you usually stick to one column or the other.

What Grimy's mod does is that it replaces the existing classes and randomizes the perks completely, making it even messier than in XCOM:EU/EW (where the classes already partly suffered from a dichotomous perk structure and where some classes had lots of Training Roulette picks, while others didn't, because some Perks were unique to a certain weapon or a prereq. to something else, or relied on having something else).

What I want to see for an XCOM 2 Training Roulette is a **[third column](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640519326)**. The classes would keep their regular two columns, but have a third column that is completely randomized based on available perks from a list (making it possible to add new perks that can only be gained from this, such as resurrecting some old XCOM:EU/EW perks, as well as avoiding inappropriate perks from showing up).

This'd mean that you'd always have a viable build or two, but with the chance of doing very unique builds based on what unique perks you're given access to.

2,False,Guildwars2,,0,1465578099,"I am a old Rift player who goes back to the game every now and then to check if something happens and it always strucks me how empty Rift is. So compared to that i would say that GW2 is what Rift was when it started and the game is 4 years and still going strong. This due to the fact that we have mega server system so you will be places on a map with players from your region, and when the map is full a new map opens and so on. In PvE only EU and NA are separated. 

The only place were servers still matters are in World verses World which is a instanced server verses server verses server game in 4 large maps. It goes on for 24/7 and resets on Fridays. To make some sort of comparing towards Rift i would say Conquest is the closest but it is not even on the same page and wvw is so much more. But anyway my point is, if this is something you want to do, you have to make sure to pick a server that are in the top tiers, because when it comes to wvw servers do matter a lot. 

Also don't miss out on our pvp. Coming from Rift you will feel you stepping in to amazingness when you understand GW2's way of pvp. 

As for PvE, well you have to understand that we do not have the holy trinity so you need to leave the tank/healer/dps kind of way behind you and start learning the way of GW2 which is by far better. Our open world pve is amazing and very much alive. Fractals and dungeons you can easy get a group or make your own (again comparing to Rift) and in the end you probably would want to aim to get the expansion if you have not got it yet. It will add maps, gliding, raids, elite specializations, masteries and more. 

The leveling is super easy but different and might take a while to get used too. Make sure you don't only grind heart quest though, there is so much more you can do, so get out and explore and try everything out. You are not missing anything if you jump between regions or maps, so just go out there. Also something different in GW2 is the gathering nodes are for all, your loot is your loot and there are no rolls and you can not steal tags. And everything you do in the world including gathering and crafting, exploring, events, dungeons and what not give you xp.

1,False,eu4,,0,1465578127,"Yeah, I don't think that continuing this coversation makes any sense, as it has become more and more hostile and you keep downvoting my posts. Just like you think I keep missing your point, I believe the same about you. Let me put it this way, my point, from the very beginning, was about game balance, even if you was was another. 

You wanting to represent Indias potential wealth, with your main argument being a comparably short period of time where it did show it (smaller sample size than Chinas millenia-long position), fucks up game balance if you don't also show that despite that wealth, India couldn't keep up with European powers on every other level. China has their negative modifiers for that, India would have nothing of that sort to simulate their ""inferiority"" towards western powers if you just arbitrarily slapped more numbers into their provinces. 

Indian tech frequently holds up against European colonizers who also have to get their armies all the way there, so from a gameplay perspective, a stronger India would simply mean an independent India, which is far worse for realisms sake than not being as comparatively wealthy as China. Money is not an accurate representation of wealth in this game; just a mechanic to facilitate gameplay. Otherwise you would be able to explain how OPM americans are wealthier and their provinces sometimes higher developed than huge states around the globe.

The argument of population is also absolutely pointless in my eyes, as a unified India has a shitload of forcelimit and in regards to realism, population doesn't mean too much (U.S output vs. Indian output/wealth today with a huge difference in population). In the game, India can fend for itself well enough, with Bahmanis and Delhi often cruising in the top 20s in regards to militaey power by the late game (if players don't intervene).

Now if your whole point was to tell me that India was richer than China for a hundred years, then you made that point across, don't worry about that, but this forum is about a *game*, where balance should come before accuracy. Again, if you'd have come up with a creative solution, I would have liked to hear it.

But networking and the way internet connections are routed across the continent is weird sometimes. Example: I usually get 80-90 ping on most Scandinavian servers (Valve Stockholm ones, some swedish and danish servers I used to go to etc.) - but on servers from Finland (like Pelippurkki, but others from the same country as well), my ping often jumps up to 150-170.

No idea why. I did some connection tracing (I barely know anything about it, just a service someone recommended) and it turned out that from my location (Slovenia), connections to Finland servers made a huge unnecessary detour to Frankfurt or Paris first and only then to Finland.

I'll admit that I never took to *Universe* - I dropped it after the first ten episodes and am disinclined to try it again. That said, I can understand fans' frustration at the abrupt ending.

The fact was that [too many people had dropped the show for it to be sustainable to SyFy.](http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/05/an-open-letter-to-stargate-fans-from-syfy/) MGM and SyFy must have seen the falling viewership and negative fan reactions from season 1 and been concerned. SyFy in particular must have been reluctant to continue to spend up to $2m/episode on an underperforming show, especially when it was pitched by Robert C. Cooper and Brad Wright with the promise that it would bring in new viewers.

&gt; Still don't understand why people believe the actors or writers wouldn't come back. It's an impressive and original story. 

As others have posted, the cast and crew have moved on to other projects. They may simply not be available due to scheduling conflicts or contractual obligations.

&gt; I don't want another movie set in another universe. I like the SGC and their characters. The point about Stargate wasn't just the gate itself. But the characters and their actors. It wouldn't feel like Stargate if we got another crew of actors. The only acceptable story would be a prequel of sorts. The story of the Ancients. 

There's still seventeen seasons of television and two direct-to-DVD movies to rewatch - that's an impressive achievement. It's not as if all that will cease to exist once the new movie hits cinemas. In terms of universe/canon, it'll be like *Star Trek* (pre-reboot) or *Star Wars* (EU) - the old material will still be there to enjoy (and there's a lot of it, too), just don't expect any new material from those eras or timelines, although there are those continuation comics for *Atlantis* and *Universe* which should be on the way.

To avoid the risk of big teams having two rosters (one salary capped for European competitions, one more expensive for domestic) the European competition salary cap can be written to include every player registered for a domestic competition regardless of whether or not they are included in the UCL squad.

Of course, if some FAs resist the resulting domestic salary cap, it wouldn't work.

No.

If your smartphones die after about a year, you're buying shitty smartphones or treating them wrong.

For one thing, here in the EU, smartphones have an automatic 2-year warranty, defined by law. So, if they simply break by design after a year, the manufacturers (or their local outlets) would quickly go bankrupt.

What you're talking about, is a *slight reduction in capacity*, which is a huge difference from ""dying"".

Check out [wikipedia on Li-Ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Battery_life) for example, and you'll see that a common lifespan is a Li-Ion battery having its **max capacity reduced to 80%** after 500 cycles, or to 70% after 1000 cycles in another example.

A smartphone with 70 or 80 percent of its original battery life is still very much a usable phone. ",t5_2t6b3,False,,1462189819,t1_d2op3mk,t3_4h9d50,0,1,d2pivg1,,TheRufmeisterGeneral

&gt;* A bomb inside a parked car in Baghdad on May 2 killed 13 Shiite pilgrims who were commemorating the death anniversary of a revered imam.

&gt;* There was no immediate claim for responsibility for the attack in Baghdads southwestern Saydiyah neighborhood, but it bore the hallmarks of extremists who call themselves Islamic State.

&gt;* Tens of thousands of Shi'ite faithful have been making their way during the past week to the northern Baghdad neighborhood of Kadhimiyah, where the 8th-century Imam Moussa al-Kadhim is buried.

&gt;* Security forces have blocked major roads in Baghdad in anticipation of attacks against pilgrims who traditionally travel on foot from different parts of Iraq.

""First, I am a first Gen immigrant so our definition of proverty may be different. For me the ability to regularly eat beef is a sign that the person is not poor. Because beef is a expensive source to nutrition, and eating it means that the person have enough money to participate in some form of luxury, thus not struggling to get by.""

We don't measure standards of living by comparing them to the globally lowest common denominator.

The benchmark where the various classes are measured are all some sort of averages (median, mod, medium) of the society, because that gives us some sort of perspective of their position in a society. 

If we were to use a single type of Goods to measure someone's income, then food would be the worst possible thing to do. Food is plenty, cheap and people spend relatively small amounts of their income on it in the US. 
A better indicator would be housing. Do they own or rent their apartment/house? But if we did that, we would find that forexample Eastern europeans -  where the price of homes are like idk. fifh of those in the US on average, - are wealthier than anyone.

That is obviously not true. Not between the US and a third world country nor inside the US itself: The same income in rural Arizona and urban SoCal or New York can put you into vastly different social brackets.

Et puis après réflexion, ce ne sont jamais les révolutions ou les révoltes populaires qui ont supprimé les Républiques françaises.

Première République : A pris fin au coup d'état du 18 brumaire (mené par Napoléon avec la complicité du clergé, tandis que la Police empêchait la population parisienne d'intervenir), et est remplacé par le Consulat et ensuite le Premier Empire.

Deuxième République (1848) : a pris fin au coup d'état de 1851 par Bonaparte et le rétablissement de l'Empire.

Troisième République (1870) : a pris neuf ans à prendre forme pendant que les dirigeants hésitaient encore à instaurer une monarchie constitutionnelle. Pris fin avec l'invasion allemande de 1940 et la création du Régime de Vichy.

C'est la Troisième République fraîchement crée après la défaite de 1970 qui a massacré les communards avec le regard bienveillant du Deuxième Reich.

Quant à la Cinquième République, on dit assez souvent qu'elle était taillée pour la carrure du Général, pour un contexte géopolitique et économique complètement changé (guerre froide et reconstruction de l'Europe). Elle est aujourd'hui corrompue, elle traîne avec elle des articles anti-démocratique comme le 49-3 et l'état d'urgence, ou peu utile, comme le sénat.

What about the Africans moving to China or Japan to help ""diversify"" those parts of the world?

Is globalization (in your eyes) only valid in Europe and North America, or is it valid everywhere?

Total nonsense. Globalism in its current form is almost entirely a social movement which supports non-white mass migration. There are few economic arguments because most of the ""big"" barriers in the world have been beaten down 30 years ago.

&gt;Conquest means the acquirement of something via force of arms. Nice try, though.

As far as I'm concerned, if that isn't racist then nothing is. However, I think it's worth it to spend a little bit of time discussing what exactly the term ""racist"" means.

Most people would probably define racism as a hierarchy of races, especially one that is enforced by means of violence, and especially the hierarchy that emerged in the wake of the European colonization of most of the inhabited world. Particularly memorable in the global history of racism is the centuries-long enslavement of black people in North America and other parts of the world. With this definition, it is extraordinarily difficult to argue that what these people did was not racist. The action was obviously intended to recall one of the more violent moments in the history of racism, and is therefore racist in that sense of the word. However, I think OP is using the word ""racist"" to mean something more along the lines of ""harboring hatred toward a particular ethnic group"". As far as I can tell, if he and many others believe the people were simply kidding, there's no reason to call them ""racist"" in this sense of the word.

While there are surely plenty of black people who do not take offense at jokes about the KKK, I think it's fairly safe to assume that the wide majority do, and with good reason. Most people do not particularly like being reminded how their ancestors were lynched by racist mobs. Sometimes it can be therapeutic or comforting or otherwise enjoyable to make jokes about horrible things. Some people just have a dark and fatalistic sense of humor and they like that kind of thing. Other times, when you know the other person shares your struggles, or at least acknowledges and understands them, a joke can be a way of dealing with the absurdities of life and creating a social bond. Hey, yeah, things are shit but we can still laugh at how ridiculous life is. But I think for most people who have some notion that things can get better, and that racism can ultimately become a thing of the past, it isn't funny when a random group of trolls on the internet decides to make an extraordinarily immature joke about an ugly horrible thing. They don't care about anyone's suffering, they just want to piss people off. Racism is *just* a joke to them, nothing more.

I suppose the best thing anyone can do is not feed them. Understandably people have emotional reactions to this sort of thing, but at the end of the day they're just a bunch of losers on the internet. They're not worth anyone's insults or hatred or anger, nor will that help anything. I hope one day the people who do this kind of thing can find the love and the self-esteem and the happiness that they are most surely missing in life.

**TL;DR:** Dressing up in Klan outfits and using racial slurs is definitely racist (if that's what happened), but I think OP is trying to say that these people don't have racial hatred because it's just a joke to them. I think it's safe to say most people take offense to this, and with good reason. Just because it's a joke doesn't mean it's not racist. At the end of the day people should try not to get too worked up about it because that's what the trolls want. I hope one day the trolls can find meaning in life, because I think it's safe to say they are pretty damned unhappy, or at least very numb to the world.",t5_2wbww,False,,1462192983,t3_4hc6yx,t3_4hc6yx,0,0,d2pk67a,,Ovelhinha_Fofinha

AMD, as early as two years ago, deployed a strategy that seemed to consist of complaining about their competitors rather than focusing on their product. 

For example; They spent a lot of time, energy and money badmouthing gameworks because they simply ""couldn't optimise for it"" and it was ""hardware exclusivity"" and yet, a year later when the press has died down over the issue they bring out drivers that drastically increase performance.

AMD was playing the perpetual victim game of the hardware industry. I'm just happy that they've stopped with a recent strategy change and focus on open source products and even working with NVidia on Vulkan.

To put it simply, both companies do shady shit. AMD spends a lot of money making sure you see NVidia's and not theirs... neither company wants a monopoly because that would see them on the receiving end of some pretty hefty sanctions from the EU and US markets.

The way companies conduct their business internationally usually is limited to following the laws in the countries in which they operate and designing products/services that best fit that region. The end goal is still to turn a profit. Trump's recent commentary regarding our foreign policy (ending military support for Japan and ROK unless they pay us, making the rest of the civilized world for the privilege of keeping shipping lanes safe, forcing Mexico to pay for a wall) make a ton of sense from a business perspective - you don't want to do something that helps somebody and not get paid for it, and there are judicial remedies to make that happen. Should you not want to provide a product or service, you can simply stop doing it.

From an international politics perspective however, especially as the dominant global superpower, those options are significantly limited. Withdrawing from East Asia and not patrolling the shipping lanes will have serious destabilizing impacts not only on our allies, but directly on us. [The U.S. imports as much as the entirety of the EU combined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_imports), and it's critical that there be safe passage on the seas. The U.S. also has the [most powerful Navy in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_level_of_military_equipment) by far, and thus the capacity to project force where nobody else can.

You cannot simply force other countries to pay, because your BATNA is awful. You can't walk away from that discussion. There are alliances and treaties and gentlemens' agreements built upon each other, and **the end goal of a country (as distinct from a company) is not to make the best return on your assets possible, but to ensure the well-being of your country across a number of factors**, including health, trade, security, and GDP. This underlying difference in end goals is hugely important, but Trump's policies don't seem to reflect a willingness to talk about that difference.

It's not a question of incompetence, it's a question of appropriate policy. Trump's a smart dude, anyone who says otherwise is missing something. But many of his policies are built around what would work for a business, not a global superpower. Whether it's because that's what appeals to his base or that's what's accessible to him is irrelevant - it's the platform he's running on.",t5_2qhc8,False,,1462193381,t1_d2pdnsi,t3_4he5do,0,9,d2pkcqe,,Hold_onto_yer_butts

Locals tend to drink in 'Brown Bars' which are like really old pubs basically, good beer and nice atmosphere due to the lack of tourists.

Waterlooplein has a market 6 days a week which is great for clothing and bits and bobs. Albertcuypstraat also has a great market, the largest in Europe apparently, a restaurant called The Butcher is also down there which is worth a visit for burgers and all that jazz.

I feel that the American democratic system is lacking in many ways, and personally I believe that Europe provides a better model for both national and regional politics, although naturally it presents its own issues. What is your opinion on regionalism in an IR context, and do you believe regional institutions are a viable means of creating economic and political power, especially for smaller states? 

Living in Singapore, although not being from here, I find that the ASEAN model is one that has done very well in promoting a generally civil diplomatic environment in a region fraught with political, ideological and religious tensions, and in my own experience regional development often creates the best outcomes for individual states, rather than going it alone. 

And one other thing, I feel that when it comes to how we (living in and coming from Western democracies) perceive ideology, we tend to skew things towards liberal, open market democracy. There have been no viable alternatives that have proven to work (although states like Cuba and Singapore have done well for themselves despite espousing non traditional models), but I don't believe that American style liberal democracy necessarily is best for every state. 

Especially not when you consider the failure of neoliberal foreign policy, which in many ways aimed to spread this form of democracy.

Maybe ESL could govern the EU league, they have definitely shown an extremely high standard the last year or two in large CS:GO tournaments. Not saying that should necessarily be the first option, but I think they would be a strong candidate.

For example, for Caribbean scuba diving, we've taken a liking to Cayman Brac.  

The Brac is uncrowded &amp; off the beaten path:  it follows what we call our **""One More Flight""** rule of thumb: those destinations which aren't where the big jet lands will tend to have fewer of the stereotypical ""Ugly Tourist"" crowd who's prone to just getting drunk and puking in the bushes outside your window...for them, the destination is effectively irrelevant.

Africa:  

I've not done much here, but Katavi National Park in Tanzania is out there:  despite it being halfway in size between Rhode Island and Delaware and TZ's third largest National Park, it still gets less than 1000 visitors per year...yes, that's like 30 per week, which is totally unlike the crowds found in the Serengeti.  

Europe:  

There's really a lot of nice places when you start to do your research (we frequently use the Rick Steves guidebooks), and even the popular places can become pretty quiet when you avoid high season...don't pass up things like Paris in February (if for no other reason than the hourly 'twinkle' lights on the Eiffel tower come on by 8-9pm instead of midnight).  

USA:

For example, for the past few years we've spent a few nights in the tourist trap of Gatlinburg, TN ... not because we really wanted to be in the tourist trap, but because its location was a big advantage for jumping out early on hiking trails in the Smokeys ... the location saves around 30-45 minutes of driving each way ... and we would get up, have breakfast &amp; have the car packed by 6:45am - - we would be out on the trail a good half hour (or more) before the masses had even gotten in line at the ""Pancake House"" breakfast joints back in town.

Unless you're building something strange, or are outside the US or Australia, it's easy to get engine parts.

The idea of dropping a 350 chevy in it where a 400 or 455 resides is absolutely stupid and ludicrous to me, and I can build lots more power for less money than the chevy and use mostly factory Pontiac parts where the chevy needs the aftermarket to run decent. My engines are a bare minimum of 37 years old, most are getting closer to 50. Run a Packard or a European 4 cylinder, and it gets harder to find parts.

&gt; Zur Souveränität: Wenn zwei souveräne, demokratische Staaten sich einigen, dass sich nationale Gerichte in der Vergangenheit nicht dadurch ausgezeichnet haben, ausländische Konzerne fair zu behandeln, wenn sie Klagen gegen den Sitzstaat des Gerichts beurteilen sollen und die beiden Staaten folgend beschließen, dass diese Gerichte unabhängig sein sollten, dann ist das in meinen Augen okay.

[Hier ein Artikel zur Problematik der Schiedsgerichte.](http://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/industrie/schiedsgerichte-justitia-verzieht-sich-ins-hinterzimmer/8126350.html) Ich bin auch hier wieder offen für Argumente die belegen, dass die Kritikpunkte nicht auf die TTIP-Thematik bezogen werden können.

As for the TPP, indeed, it has only passed the signatory stage, and is likely to fail in Countries like Japan. But once a critical mass of the signatories sign it, it becomes pointless for the resistant to resist. It's one thing to disagree with the CREATION of a new market with new regulations, it's much harder to resist said market when it is created, look at the UK in 1973.

My point, however, is that the argument that it's still not AT the signatory stage is at least as weak as my own, if not ridiculously more so. The TPP was under highly secretive (we can agree on this at least?) consultation, leaked and within a few short months signed moving an important step towards implementation despite pretty heavy opposition.

With TTIP, and the startling lack of coverage of such a wide-reaching treaty coupled with the startling disconnect between people and Government in the UK, and the glut of privatisation currently going on (Schools, the NHS, the BBC being undermined at every opportunity to the point it is now reliant on and whipped BY the state) if such an agreement was reached in the UK between the Conservatives and America I could see it being very hard to remove without direct EU action, which may become a good deal harder if June 23rd goes Brexit. Such a situation with American Health-care already invested in the NHS coupled with the ISDS suggested in TTIP could render these changes permanent.

I may have used ""too late"", which is a good stick to beat anyone with for being exaggerative. But at some point, it WILL be, and I'd rather act like it might be too late tomorrow than wait till it is.

M21 also broken as hell. The infamous noob-tube was also broken.

Many perks were idiotic, especially those that gave you C4, Claymores (there's a reason they were always called Gaymores and banned on almost all servers) or God forbid RPG-7. Juggernaut was ridiculous aswell.

Map design was fairly good I guess? But it still left a lot to desire, considering out of 20 maps only 5 were playable for competitive (I guess you could say 6, since Vacant was also played in NA, in EU - not so much) - Strike, Crossfire, Crash, Backlot, Citystreets (aka District).

The pace of game got a lot slower too. The fact that the game had sprint and yet played slower than CoD2 which didn't have it is laughable.

Killstreaks will always be a stupid addition for me. Seeing everyone on map after 3 kills is stupid, just like Hind/Cobra flying above map and giving you kills without any action from your side. Every addition to the game that rewards you for little to no skill-input from your side is bad. Period.

I could go on, but I think it should give you an idea. I get it that some people can enjoy such games. There's a reason why they sell, especially on consoles.

It was unique because it had perfect mix of realism, arcade and simulation.

3. Not in the business of regime change but have to protect our interests

6. Drugs - decriminalize weed

7. Civil Rights - everyone should have equal rights. Racist exists!

8. Environment - sustainability is paramount to our future

2,False,crossfit,,0,1465581772,"Yeah, +1 for Google Trends.  Honestly, it will be the best publicly available data for this sort of question:  it's a decent proxy for general public interest.  It's probably better than Affiliate Count (if you could even get that data from HQ, which I doubt) as that measures how many gyms there are, not how many people are interested.  And better than Open Registrations, as not all Crossfitters do the Open.  Plus it's sensitive down to the day, whereas Open's are only once a year.

Just quickly looking at the trends data, it's clear that there is a plateau.  Worldwide we hit Peak Crossfit in 2013/14.  What's happened since is that the US has been in decline (worrying for HQ), but that countries around the world are still in growth (albeit at lower aggregate volume).  Much of Europe still is in the growth phase (UK hit peak in 2014, Iceland in 2011 - Annie T!, but e.g. France is still shooting upwards)...

Play around with it...  Google Trends is actually particularly well suited for this question due to the uniqueness of Crossfit as a term [I use this data a fair bit for work and it generally works less well than this].  The ""search volume index"" you see when you mouse over a country is a measure of how big in aggregate terms Crossfit is as a share of overall search volume:  Iceland is the highest, and is thus arbitrarily set to 100, everywhere else is scaled off that.  Click into a country to see the trend.  There's obviously seasonality by year, seemingly around the Open, Regionals and Games.  The ""search volume index"" is not scaled by population, so if you wanted to work out market opportunity in each country, I'd multiple by population and take into account whether interest is growing.  E.g. France is at 7 but pop 66MM (and in growth) so is better than Iceland at 100 but pop 0.3MM (and stable)...",t5_2qqfd,False,,1462201776,t1_d2p0ytu,t3_4h96ws,0,2,d2ppacx,,contrapti0n

2. Check what the fees are - you may be charged out of network ATM fees by your bank as well as the ATM you are using, and additionally a % charge for ""foreign transaction"" charge. These can add up a lot, so check ahead. 

3. If your card has a chip in it, make sure it is activated properly. In the US, very few vendors even support chip cards, so they swipe the card. In Europe, they will use the chip reader, and if it's not activated, they'll often end up handing the card back to you.

And a higher percentage of Muslim Americans than the general public report that their annual household earnings are less than $30,000 (45% among Muslims, 36% among the general public).

I think that second point of yours - that *anyone* can be an ""American"" regardless of where they came from and how long ago - is the biggest reason for why there's so much more tension between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe than in America. In my experience, European ideals of nationality are far more exclusionary, and as such on their own help breed tensions. While I'm not aware of similar surveys for other European countries, the [British Social Attitudes](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-31/national-identity/defining-british-identity.aspx) survey shows that about half of Brits consider ""Having British ancestry"" to be ""very important"" or ""fairly important"" to being ""truly British"".

1,False,WhiteWolfRPG,,0,1465582341,"A group coming into either Werewolf from DnD probably won't be able to tell a huge difference either way. Both games are as close to Dungeons and Dragons as the World of Darkness ever comes.

In both games, the setup closely resembles an adventuring group. The basic unit of society in both Werewolf games is the Pack, generally composed of 3-7 werewolves. Each werewolf is assigned a ""class"" (referred to as Auspice) from birth. **Ahroun**/*Rahu* are the born warriors, **Galliard**/*Cahalith* are the bards, **Philodox**/*Elodoth* are the paladins, **Theurge**/*Ithaeur* are the wizards, and **Ragabash**/*Irakka* are the rogues.

Both games are focused more on action than most of the World of Darkness games. Werewolves in both games follow virtues called Renown which reward behavior typically thought of as adventurous, such as Honor, Glory and Wisdom.

Both werewolves are also involve in spirit worship, which ironically fuels a more materialistic bent than a game like Vampire. Because Werewolves revere the spirits of material items, with especially powerful items called Fetishes, both Werewolf games accommodate the gathering of ""loot"".

Mechanically, the two games are *close*, but not quite. They both use the usual Storyteller mechanic of Attribute+Skill for any given action.

Apocalypse is more concerned with target numbers. The storyteller sets a Difficulty from 3-10 depending on how tough a given action is perceived to be. The player then rolls his dice pool and any die that comes up equal to or higher than the Difficulty number is counted as a success. One is usually enough to succeed, with rare exceptions. Players can spend Willpower to get an automatic success.

In comparison, Forsaken is more concerned with the total dice pool. The Difficulty is always 8, but the Storyteller can add or subtract dice from a player's pool to represent tools and difficulty. You only ever need one success on these rolls to succeed (and you should almost never expect to get more), while the rare occurrence of five successes is an exceptional success. Players can spend Willpower to gain three extra dice.

The biggest mechanical difference is going to be seen in **Combat**.

Apocalypse uses a system that relies on multiple stages per attack, and actively encourages multiple actions per turn. A single attack turn is composed of the Attack roll for accuracy, the target's Dodge roll to avoid, a Damage roll and the target's Soak roll to reduce damage taken. Actions can be split at a minor penalty to dice pools and Werewolves can take extra *full* actions almost at will by spending their physical currency, Rage. This can be quite complicated and unnecessarily long.

In comparison, Forsaken uses a single dice roll for combat. An Attack roll that automatically subtracts a target's defense as a penalty, with any successes being added to a weapon's Rating to apply damage. Characters cannot take multiple actions in the Chronicles of Darkness.

The biggest difference between the two is the **Lore**, however.

Apocalypse features a decade-long metaplot that revolves around a universal war between the Werewolves and the cosmological representation of Corruption, the Wyrm. The Wyrm has gone insane and spews forth (or converts) minions that want to destroy the cosmos to end it's owns suffering. The Werewolves are warriors born of Gaia to combat the Wyrm. The werewolves are a global army composed of 12 great familial tribes trying to take back sacred places torn asunder by human greed and spiritual corruption. The Amazon, Canada and other ""endangered"" areas are major battlefronts, but the Werewolves also fight at home in places like Europe and the United States as big, bad corporations destroy everything that makes the world and humanity great.

Forsaken is almost on the opposite end of the spectrum. Forsaken suggests Werewolves are more localized, animalistic monsters. They form their packs and carve out a swath of territory which they protect from all others - including other werewolves. There is no ""big bad"" baked into the setting (though the book offers up the mad gods, Idigam, for the role), it's just a bunch of isolated packs fighting for survival. This might be from spirits, who constantly try to breach the wall between worlds to experience our realm by possessing people or flooding cities with a glut of emotions, both good and bad. It might be from the Pure, werewolves who ally with spirits to spite the Forsaken. It might be from humanity, vampires, ghosts, even other Forsaken.",t5_2u6fa,False,mortal,1462204369,t3_4hhr3w,t3_4hhr3w,0,1,d2pqhrz,,machiavalium

Firstly, I didn't act surprised. I scoffed at it. Two, there was a thread recently of Celtic fans crying about how Rangers fans had ruined this subreddit etc woe is me bla bla bla. Past caring.

Are you deliberately ignoring all the other aspects of his achievement this season? Because that's exactly what it seems like you're doing. Yes, Rangers were expected to win the league. Big pat on the back to you with your footballing wisdom. However, the league win isn't the only aspect of his tenure he's being judged on, and it's the manner of that win which is notable.

Rangers - I say arguably but I don't think there's any question about it - are the best FOOTBALLING side in Scotland. No other team keeps the ball like Rangers, no other team has the same out and out attacking philosophy like Rangers. Some of the team goals have been breathtaking. That isn't to say Rangers are the best side in the country - they aren't. We have weaknesses. But Warburton has achieved this within his first season from a completely new squad. This team has had Kilmarnock, Dundee, even St Johnstone for long spells in that League Cup game, oh and the champions of Scotland Celtic completely on the back foot in games. Rangers have dominated top end Premiership opposition whilst in a division below. There isn't a major gulf between the two divisions but the manner in which Rangers beat these sides is all the more impressive and Warburton deserves credit for that.

The league was won with time to spare. The Petrofac Cup was won and hey whatever people can slate it but the likes of Falkirk with Houston and Hibs with Stubbs didn't win it. Rangers are also in the Scottish Cup Final against Hibs, ahead of all Premiership sides including Celtic after turning them over, with a potential European campaign in July. He's done that within not even 12 months. This isn't even to mention his complete revamp of the club's youth system and his ability to revitalise the careers of young players like McKay, Holt and Waghorn.

1,False,todayilearned,,0,1465582399,"&gt; The major weak point is the timing chain guides, which commonly fail at high mileage and sometimes take the whole motor with it

Almost every car made since the 1950s has a timing chain or belt system that will fail somewhere after 150,000 miles.

There are two types of engines out there- interference and noninterference. An interference engine will destroy itself if the timing belt/chain fails. A noninterference engine will survive perfectly unharmed (but will not operate until the chain/belt is redone).

It does not really matter which engine type it is- the bill to do a timing belt/chain is going to be more than many cars are worth once they reach this kind of mileage. 

Interestingly, when timing belts &amp; chains became popular in the 50s-60s a lot of racers were scared of them and anticipated frequent failures (this never really materialized to the extent of their fears) so a common racing mod was to replace the belt/chain system with solid metal gears, which made the engines sound like they have a big supercharger in them all the time because of the constant gear noise.

Now if you want to talk real absurd planed obsolescence in cars- look at the PCV systems in a lot of European cars where at around 150,000 miles you need to drop $1-3 grand and tare apart the entire freaking engine just to replace some clogged hoses &amp; fittings (that on any traditional car can be done without disassembly for less than $5 in parts).

If the PCV system clogges (looking at you- Volvo, Audi/VW, etc) and you ignore it- pressure builds up in the engine and starts blowing out the engine's gaskets/seals. Clogged PCV will also fail the car at emissions inspections, so it will cease to be road legal.

Muito RESUMIDAMENTE, algumas pessoas começaram a estudar o Marxismo e tal, seus conceitos, axiomas, etc. Uma das partes desse estudo trata da REVOLUÇÃO DO PROLETARIADO, que dizia: ""[...] um dia a galera toda vai ficar puta e vai tomar os meios de produção dos chefes malditos e todos viverão felizes para sempre [...]"".

Tinha um camarada (infelizmente) genial de sobrenome Gramsci, que, nessa parte do estudo, disse: ""Hey, caralho, para tudo nessa porra! Essa revolução do proletariado não vai acontecer dessa forma! O proletariado não é organizado. Além disso, esses porras gostam de grana e conforto, e os patrões malvados fornecem isso para eles, além da melhora da porra da qualidade de vida..."".

Dessa forma, Gramsci e seus amiguinhos começaram a bolar como a parada ia ser dominada: polarização da sociedade e seu consequente enfraquecimento (discussões dicotômicas atuais, como negro x branco, hetero x homo, etc), tomada dos meios de comunicação, sexualização infantil, etc. Quebrando as bases da sociedade ocidental (família, igreja), ""castrando"" o homem comum, inversão de valores e tomando as universidades para a doutrinação, criaria o ambiente ideal de enfraquecimento da sociedade, que seria, então, dominada pela porra toda.  

Gramsci sabia que, um dia, haveria pessoas que repetiriam toda a doutrinação, sem nem pensar (os famosos ""idiotas úteis""). O problema é que ele sabia, também, que essas pessoas seriam formadores de opinião, professores, etc.

52,False,brasil,,0,1465582720,"À começar da família da casa particular onde fiquei hospedado. As maiores críticas que ouvi foram em relação aos baixos salários, à dificuldade de acessar Internet e à impossibilidade de viajar. Pra exemplificar um pouco: um professor de curso secundário ganha aproximadamente 20 CUCs por mês. O acesso a Internet custa 2 CUCs por hora. Uma lata de cerveja custa 1 CUC. Um profissional fora da área de turismo nunca vai conseguir juntar uma quantia pra pagar uma passagem internacional. O governo passou a permitir que cubanos saiam do país, é uma liberdade que conquistaram, mas acompanhada de uma impossibilidade prática. É frustrante demais pra eles, principalmente porque possuem um conhecimento político-geográfico que desperta um desejo bastante legítimo de conhecer outras culturas. E mesmo que consigam juntar algum dinheiro pra viajar, ou que tenham uma passagem paga pra participar de algum evento por exemplo, terão uma chance enorme de ter o visto negado. Nas áreas agrícolas, as maiores queixas foram em relação à dificuldade de comprar roupas, acessórios básicos e material apropriado pra executar o trabalho no campo.

Mas o grande ponto está exatamente na forma que você (e que eu também!) formulou a questão: ""...que não gostam do governo"". Como disse, a experiência que tive me deu a impressão que as questões não são reduzidas a esse ponto. Não é por conta de uma série de críticas que alguém vai simplesmente gostar ou não gostar do governo. Em geral eles compreendem as motivações da revolução, se orgulham do sistema de educação, de saúde, da 'canasta básica' e de outros benefícios. Entendem também que a escassez não é puramente uma imposição do estado, mas também uma consequência do bloqueio econômico externo. Nos primeiros dias, quando eu começava a conversar, eu tentava identificar se o sujeito 'gostava' ou 'não gostava' do governo. Se era 'revolucionário esquerdista' ou 'liberal', e sempre me frustrava, até entender que as discussões estavam muito além desses estereótipos.

2,False,unitedkingdom,,0,1465582739,"&gt; You can implement soil management programs, nutrient recycling, sustainable pesticide use etc. along with GM crops to achieve a better yield than with all of those things without GM crops.

You can and that would be great but the majority of GM is large scale monoculture and is not designed with those methods in mind. Monoculture strips the soil of organic material which makes it less resilient to drought, GM monoculture is also creating super weeds. I will give you some more  evidence;

http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ditcted2012d3_en.pdf

&gt;Broadly speaking, countries making a substancial shift to GM crops are in a group where food secruity has either shown no improvement (e.g. United States), or where it is declining (e.g. Argentina).
The predictable pattern and quality of glyphosate herbicide use in GM agriculture has caused the evolution of resistance in weeds on a scale never experienced in the decades of glyphosate use prior to GM crops, leading to a return to tilling and the use of other herbicides for weed control...

This paper also argues that comparing USA and Canada GM crops with EU none GM crops ""...maize yields are very similar in the two agroecosystems, and Western Europes's rapeseed yields are about double those of North America. This trend has not changed since the adoption of GM plants in North America.""
And it talks about the problems of mono-culture (environmental issue) which GM promotes...

So much love for GM and so much hate for organic out there, the issue is complex and GM is by no means a silver bullet as is often presented. Organic and agroecology also has its limitations, but anyone saying organic is a pseudoscience has no idea what they are talking about.",t5_2qhqb,False,,1462205690,t1_d2pqtnn,t3_4hg9c8,0,2,d2prc8t,,justthisplease

""An attempt to pull back from economic progress""

Yes, that's exactly what they argue for.   Well done.  You deciphered it.

&gt;dragged on by wild soothsayer claims about trade treaties that realistically wouldn't happen,

Why would you even try to claim such a thing?

Commonwealth countries are already making agreements with each other and the wider Anglosphere, plus other players where the EU has so far failed.  Australia already has free trade agreements with smaller friendly fish like New Zealand and Singapore, but also the United States and China.

Switzerland with no such shared-culture advantage already has more trade agreements than the EU.

What doesn't require soothsaying is that the EU is a poor negotiator with only six of its trade agreements to date including service provision, which is a diabolical situation for a country like the UK where services represent 80% of our economy.

I find this defeatism to do the UK down in terms of aspiration, regardless of what it decides to do, very ugly.  Other countries just go out and do it whilst you sit in the corner saying it ""realistically  wouldn't happen"".

&gt;It's a wilful failure to recognise the current state of the world and the way it's going. 

I'm calling you out on that one as well because a protectionist customs union, and their discussing even the prospect of putting tariffs UP, bucks all the global trends where tariffs are coming down.

Name me the other customs unions that are paving this progressive agenda with a Common External Tariff.  Mercosur?  That's hardly paving the way.

No, the global progress if anywhere is made at the WTO, where the UK being part of the EU means giving up on its negotiation seat and being represented by 1/28th of a seat which is currently occupied by a former psychiatric nurse and sociology lecturer.

Man, I don't think you and I are so different, not sure why you're okay with wood cellulose and soy fillers and whatnot in meat, but okay. The original conversation was US vs EU food laws, not the nitpickings of whether or not toys in food being banned equates to food fillers (which you brought up). You made that connection, not me. So, I started talking about food fillers. 

So, your contention is that because the sawdust is washed first, it's perfectly fine to use. Okay. It's definitely more sanitary, I guess.

The biggest theological quibble was probably the sale of indulgences. First indulgence was given at Clermont by Urban II as remission for the Crusaders, but individual charlatans got greedy. Boniface IX publicly condemned the sale of indulgences well before Luther was even born, and Trent would later address this and many other grievances. The only reason Luther's Reformation didn't go the way of previous heretical movements was because he happened to live at the time of the printing press; his Theses got spread far and wide and stirred up malcontent with the Church (which was exploited by opportunistic HRE princes), hence why literary historians like to claim that Luther was the first international bestselling author who we could put a direct name to and who lived during his fame.

I have to change to corsair RMi PSU because for some reason 99% of the stores only sell 850W+ EVGA GS / G2 which is expensive and not needed. As for the MOBO I read a lot and I'm not sold on H110 as it is the cheapest but the lowest quality and least features. H170 might be double in price but can be expanded if needed in the future so most likely I'll go with it - still debating a bit between b150 and h170. Same for memory, the best places only sell 2400-3000 G.skill ripjaws so I went back to corsair 2133 mhz, but that is probably the smallest price-difference. I don't really want to order parts from outside of my country because of warranty reasons mainly and it can be a pain to get them inside sometimes even from inside the EU.

Go to Battambang, Kampot, Koh Kong. Dirt cheap, more 'authentic' (I hate using that term, as if I actually understand the culture after being there a week). Myanmar is relatively tourist free as well, though that comes with less tourist infrastructure.

In Europe, the Balkans have been mentioned, but I'd recommend the Baltics as well. Lithuania and Latvia are amazing, would love to return there! In Malta at the moment - whilst it is definitely not tourist free, it is arguably my favourite Mediterranean destination, and I've been to most. And most people would recommend the riviera or costas, whereas Malta is arguably nicer and cheaper!

In the UK, go to South Wales (Pembroke in particular). Gorgeous scenery, not too touristy. 

I'm afraid the days of super nice, yet deserted are long gone - the tourists quickly swarm anywhere idyllic without any sense of irony. But if you want to avoid crowds, look at peak periods. I toured SE Asia in May/June (beginning of rainy season), and never had too much issue with crowds, whilst avoiding rainy season. Here in Malta, it's been great weather for months now, but the crowds are only starting to arrive now. If you're doing a city break, go in April or October (avoiding school holidays) - you are likely to avoid the crowds and get reasonable weather.

If you want a deck that is not really cometitive but its fun and cheap, you can try dinomists or lunalights (lunalights will get released in 3 days). I would say you can get the whole deck with ~30$. Deskbots are in the same category I feel, maybe a bit stronger (? not sure havent played them much).

The most competitive deck that is cheap is Monarchs (3x Structure decks). Also another cheap deck that is competitive might be pure Burning Abyss but I havent checked the prices for that.

Buying booster packs is never cheaper than buying single cards themselves. The easiest ones to find will be: Monarchs since they are a structure deck, and lunalight because the set they're in is getting released now and stores will have supplies. For the others it really depends on your shop, or if you are willing to buy online. For EU players yugiohcardmarket is a great site. Make sure to buy the cards in english though. 

EDIT: It depends on what you want to do with your deck too. If you just want to play with friends/family you dont have to buy the best thing ever, but if you want to compete at locals and get first place etc you might want to consider the stronger decks.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/7ba1bd54f8fa46b4a3f05daeef7902b7.png)  

&gt; Vasko was born in Sofia in 1970. By eight, he was already a star prodigy violinist and the star actor in an international awardwinning film. In his teens, he won top prizes in three major international violin competitions (Jacques Thibault; Carl Flesch and Paganini) and embarked on a worldwide solo performing career. Since becoming the youngest and first ever concertmaster at the Royal Opera House, (where his ceiling height photograph by Mario Testino adorns the reception) Vasko has continued to widen his artistic horizons. Aside from the classical arena, he has also enjoyed artistic collaborations in various capacities, not limited to violinplaying, with many musical names from other sectors such as Vanessa-Mae, Ronnie Wood, Sting, Paco Pena, Erasure, to name but a few.

&gt; He is Artistic Director/Leader of Laureate an instrumental group made up exclusively of international prizewinning instrumentalists. With Laureate, Vasko recorded the multiplatinum selling ‘Original Four Seasons’ with Vanessa-Mae (who was his student from the age of 11 onwards), ragtime, Paganini and a multi-genre project called Total Immersion which had its launch at the Royal Opera House. Vasko is the Principal Conductor of the Bulgarian National Radio Orchestra, with whom he has toured and recorded. He is also the Artistic Director of the Super-Girls Orchestra with whom he made his UK conducting debut at the Royal Albert Hall in a stunning showcase of classical set pieces and new works amalgamating styles and music of soloists from some 14 nations. Vasko has toured sell-out concerts with the Super Girls Orchestra in Eastern Europe and Spain.

&gt; Since becoming Creative Producer of the Royal Opera House, in which position he introduces cross-cultural and multi-media projects to this centuries-old institution, he has also broadened his artistic horizons and is now partly based in China where he is developing new television and theatre projects. Already conversant in English, Bulgarian, Russian and Spanish, he is currently studying Mandarin. Read more on Last.fm.

3,False,AskHistorians,,0,1465584146,"So maybe the Cuban Missile Crisis isn't the best example of the Soviets ""backing down,"" as some other commentators have noted.  I'd agree, but I think it's worth pointing out that the missiles in Turkey that JKF agreed to withdraw were obsolete the moment they were deployed (and therefore were likely to be removed anyway) and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, rightly or wrongly, *was* an embarrassment for Khrushchev which played a role in is overthrow just a few years later.

There is, however, at least one prominent example of the United States ""backing down"" to the Soviet Union after WWII (and obviously examples of the United States ""backing down"" during the war to Soviet demands regarding what would become the ""Soviet sphere""): the complete abandonment of ""Rollback,"" a policy promoted at some point by both Truman and Eisenhower aimed at liberating nations from Soviet control.  The policy manifested in the Korean War.  And while the contrasting policy of ""containment"" (i.e., the suffocation of Soviet rule by preventing its spread) had gained prominence in American foreign policy by 1956, the National Security Council nevertheless responded to protests in Hungary against Soviet rule by reaffirming that  ""the elimination of Soviet domination of the satellites is . . . in the fundamental interest of the United States.""  Indeed, the United States had attempted to spur such unrest in Hungary for years, dropping propaganda in Hungary asserting that Soviet rule could be overthrown.  

Once revolution broke out in Hungary, however, the United States quickly backed down.  Sure, the Eisenhower administration initially protested the ensuing Soviet crackdown and promised not to ally with Hungary if the Soviet Union allowed the nation independence, but this was the extent of the American effort.  The United States declared that it would not get involved in the military conflict, which, according National Security Adviser Walter Rostow a decade later, gave the Soviets a free hand to crush the rebellion. 


Now you might expect to see lots of American historians counter this argument by saying that rollback was never official American policy, that the concurrent Suez Crisis is what really stopped the United States from doing more, etc., etc., but you should see how Hungarian historians remember this apparent change of heart.  As Laszlo asserts, ""The American response to the 1956 Hungarian revolution encapsulated Washington’s Janus-faced attitude toward the liberation of Eastern Europe."" In any case, there is no doubt that the United States had backed down from its bold policy of ""rollback"" in favor of policies that would not lead to a direct confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union.

2,False,TrueAtheism,,0,1465584226,"You don't understand what the etymological fallacy is.  Apparently you think _all_ etymology based explanations are fallacious.  That's pretty silly, isn't it?  One makes the etymological fallacy when claiming that the modern commonly understood meaning of words must be similar to or identical to the original meaning.  Did you not read the part where I said that ""gnosticism"" does __not__ mean what it meant to the Gnostics?  I not only did not commit the fallacy, I explicitly said the opposite!   

As for ""atheism,"" the word is _not_ a Greek word, nor even a Latinized version of a Greek word.  THAT would be the etymological fallacy but nowhere did I say such a thing. The term does trace its origins to the ancient Greek _(a)theos_ [(ἄ)θεος] which meant   ""without gods; godless; impious; denying or disdaining the gods.""   Atheos is sometimes translated as ""atheistic.""  The Greek word that would best be translated to ""atheism"" was atheotēs, an abstract noun.  Cicero transliterated the Greek word into the Latin atheos.   Early Christians and Hellenists used it to label the other in a  derogatory way. I cited the etymological history strictly as shorthand, because the commonly understood meaning of ""atheism"" (among atheists, that is, and since atheists are the ones identifying with the word their sense ought to reign supreme)  _does_ in fact closely resemble the ancient original. More importantly, I was pointing out the distinction of reference to belief versus reference to knowledge. 

Our English word ""atheism"" entered the language fairly recently, via French, I think it was. In _A History of God_ Karen Armstrong wrote ""During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for polemic ... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling himself an atheist.""   According to Encyclopaedia Brittanica, the first time the word described a positive belief was in Europe in the late 18th century when it meant disbelief in (one of the) the monotheistic Abrahamic god(s). Michael Martin, in _The Cambridge Companion to Atheism_, says  that in the 20th century the meaning was expanded to refer to disbelief in all deities. But of course it is still common in Western cultures to describe atheism as just  ""disbelief in God"".

c&amp;p from the atheists.org site, because it's instructive:  

&gt;Older dictionaries define atheism as ""a belief that there is no God."" Some dictionaries even go so far as to define Atheism as ""wickedness,"" ""sinfulness,"" and other derogatory adjectives. Clearly, theistic influence taints dictionaries. People cannot trust these dictionaries to define atheism. The fact that dictionaries define Atheism as ""there is no God"" betrays the (mono)theistic influence. Without the (mono)theistic influence, the definition would at least read ""there are no gods.""    

If you read any of the leading atheists - Harris, Dennett, Dawkins, and many others - you'll find that they are rather insistent that ""atheism"" does _not_ mean ""there is no god.""  Most thinking atheists are of the same position.  Over in /r/atheism they're rather insistent about it.  

 
Now once again, (a)theism refers to (non)belief.  (A)gnosticism refers to (lack of)knowledge. One can be an agnostic theist as was,  perhaps most famously, Kierkegaard. He _believed_ in a god but lacked knowledge of that god. You would do well to read up on his famous ""leap of faith"" explanation. One can be an agnostic atheist, which most of the people I associate with identify as. They don't know there are no gods but they do not believe in any, or they believe there are none, but admit that they don't have certain knowledge. 

I myself identify as a gnostic atheist.  But what that means requires elucidation.  I _know_ that none of the thousands of gods invented over the millennia are real.  Odin, Zeus, Yahweh, Allah, Shiva, they all are provably nonexistent. That's because they all have very specific attributes, and are said to have done things that we know did not happen.  Using Yahweh as example, the Earth was not created 6000 years ago, there were never large number of Israelite slaves in Egypt, there was no Exodus, there was no global flood, and so on.  Is it possible there is an invisible, silent, inert deity a la deism?  Of course it's _possible_ but the claim there is is not falsifiable.  Therefore I am an agnostic atheist with respect to certain deities.

0,False,AskTrumpSupporters,,0,1465584742,"&gt; How did Obama contribute to this ""divisiveness"" that you cite here? Obama has made repeated overtures to Republicans in Congress and has attempted to compromise with them. Is he ""divisive"" simply for pursuing an agenda? Isn't that what the president is supposed to do?

I've cited examples elsewhere, unity starts from the top and Obama was not a unifier. 

&gt; I don't believe that Bush brought the country together. The Iraq war that Bush pursued was very divisive.

Do you remember the unity this country had after 9/11? We all flew our American flags, instead of stomping and spitting on them, as we see so many Americans do now. 

&gt; Say what you will about BLM's methods, but they have a legitimate complaint. People are being murdered on camera and the perpetrators are going free. Why shouldn't they speak up?

Combating violence and racial discrimination with violence and racial discrimination isn't how you fix violence and racial discrimination. 

&gt;  I'm not sure where you get the ""inner cities"" figure. Some cities are certainly doing very badly, but the overall black unemployment rate is around 8-9% (10% for young men).

The figure I cited was for inner city youth. 50% unemployment. 

&gt; I suppose Obama could made a major push to close the black-white unemployment gap. I suspect he would have been criticized as being ""racist"" and ""divisive"" if he did.

If Obama stopped focusing policy based on which demographic group it would benefit, and started basing policy on the overall benefit for Americans, we'd be a lot more unified. Yet, when the president goes on national television to talk about how Trayvon Martin could be his son, and then stays awfully quiet when our military recruitment centers get attacked, we aren't talking about a unifier.

&gt; Just so we're clear, which allies specifically are we talking about here? 

Israel &amp; Japan to name two.

&gt;  Obama was slow to react to ISIS but I don't think this disqualifies his entire presidency. 

Obama aided the largest terrorist organization with military capability to exist and own swaths of territory. You don't think this defines his presidency?

&gt;  Obama has not ""funded"" Iran - Obama obtained the strictest multinational sanctions against Iran in decades in order to force Iran to negotiate over the nuclear program, and then allowed those sanctions and asset freezes to expire once an agreement was reached.

You can use whatever pejuratoives you like here's the result. Obama allowed for Iran to attain $150 billion dollars. Obama allowed for Iran to re-enter the global economy and have the major influence in their region. If that in some way made Iran weaker, I'd love to here the justification. If we truly believe Iran is now going to be a nice ally, why did they capture our soldiers and videotape them as propaganda? Why is the Ayatollah still yelling death to America? Why are they shooting rockets and violating the agreement?

&gt;  Russia's economy is collapsing and I don't see how they have benefited from incursions into Ukraine. At best, Russia is treading water by keeping Assad in power.

Russia's economy collapse is what is truly troubling. Alienating the worlds 2nd largest military and allowing for their economy to crumble, is a poor strategy at obtaining regional and global stability. 

&gt; The unemployment rate has dropped significantly under Obama. Some of that decline is due to demographic factors, but if you look at private-sector job creation (number of jobs created) Obama is way ahead of both Bushes and is at the same level as Reagan.

Look at the fact Obama has never had 3% GDP growth. Look at the fact that our worker participation rate is the lowest its been since the great depression. Look at the fact that our growth last quarter was 0.5%. Then you'll stop harboring un-rigged unemployment numbers, or ""jobs created"" that don't count for ""jobs lost"" and start realizing the impending recession we are facing with Obamas economic strategy or lack thereof. 

&gt; TPP has not passed yet. How has it sent jobs overseas?

Obama wanted to pass TPP and there's no evidence this would not create jobs. 

&gt; ""Exponential growth"" sounds scary, except our economy is also growing exponentially.


Ahh what?

&gt; The goal of Dodd-Frank was not to make banks smaller, but to increase the stability of the financial system and stop the systemic fraud that we saw before the 2008 collapse. It's early but there are signs of progress so far.

How is there signs of progress if the majority of the wealth is being held by fewer people? How is that any more stable?

&gt; How has Obamacare caused small business to close their doors? Which data are showing this?

Look at the part-time employment numbers, look how many people were forced to down-size to circumvent the law.

&gt; Which executive order? Is this DACA? I personally don't think he has that authority but calling it dictatorship is a stretch.

Yes DACA, and amnesty. Look at the impact of his executive orders compared to that of other presidents in the modern era. 

&gt; I think #6 and #7 are talking about the same thing.

I mean yes and no. 7 is a direct absolvement of his duty. 6 is abuse of power. 

&gt; Solyndra was a pretty small firm. It was given loans to develop renewable energy technologies and, like many business, folded. It is telling that out of the $600B or so stimulus package, this is the only failure that Obama opponents have been able to point to.

The point is it is an example of the crony-capitalism Obama subscribed to. The same thing Hillary subscribes to. 

&gt; I would rate him among the best post-WW2 presidents.

You must be delusional then, or not acknowledging the fact that our economy is in shambles. Our global environment is in volatility the kind that was pre-WWII. We have a EU on the verge of collapse. A Middle East that is crumbling by the day, an Arab Spring that created more chaos, an ignored Syrian Civil War that brewed a cross-continental caliphate. We have an Asia with an ever increasing imperialistic China. A North Korean dictator launching missiles from submarines. We have a Russia in economic decline, a refugee crisis overtaking Western culture, Islamic extremism, unemployment and economic collapses all over Europe, and you think our president is a success. What a joke.

1,1462212137,AskEurope,,0,1465584788,"I can't always connect the author to any specific books off-the-bat, but I couldn't really do that with even authors native to where I live. Anyway -- I've at least briefly been exposed to Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville.

Moby Dick and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer were up for reading in elementary school and the synopses of them were described in the school books about the history of literature. I'd expect most people to be pretty well aware of those books, if not having read them themselves. I'm quite sure I read the latter as a kid, but all I can remember is adventure. Maybe kids aren't the best witnesses for cultural intricacies.

Edgar Allan Poe is, well, I'd expect everyone in the Western world who read at all to be at least somewhat familiar with him.

Here Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman aren't quite as well known I think, but to be fair, the authors who write about adventure, scares or the fantastical tend to be better remembered. I wouldn't imagine that everyone were aware of even the likes of Alexandre Dumas or Leo Tolstoy either!

Overall, I don't think that there's really a big cultural difference in the heritage of literature in most of the Europe and USA. It's really been an entangled affair since the late 18th, I'd like to believe. We're much more alike than not, even in the details.

As a fun side-note, a lot of literature classics are made familiar to us via.. Donald Duck! As weird as it might sound, the Donald Duck magazine is hugely popular even among adults in the Nordic countries and Italy. They often make actually very accurate and well-made Duck versions of classics like The Three Musketeers or Moby Dick or so.

&gt; One last question - if you are familiar with Twain, can you recommend similar writers with whom I'm likely not familiar? 

Mmh.. A bit tricky one - I'd expect you're pretty familiar with the peers of Twain back in his times. For some European authors of 18th and 19th centuries that haven't been mentioned here: Maybe Robert Louis Stevenson (Treasure Island, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde), Guy de Maupassant (mostly known for his short story collections, including horror/supernatural stories), Daniel Defoe (Robinson Crusoe), Jules Verne (Journey to the Center of the Earth Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days) or... Arthur Conan Doyle?

Some slightly more modern authors might include C. S. Forester (nautical adventure novels), Theodore Dreiser (An American Tragedy) and, naturally, Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita). Would really recommend the latter, if you haven't yet read it.

Food(especially breads and meats) is distinctly worse in the United States than in the other countries I listed. The only country I've been to with worse meat than the US was Cuba. Soft drinks taste considerably worse in the United States compared with Europe and Mexico/Cuba. Many types of chocolate and desert foods taste worse in the United States.

Fruit is pretty much the only exception I can think of. Berries taste considerably better(and are larger), for instance.

If the final version is not acceptable to the government, it can reject it.

If you're in the US, the way the federal agencies makes rules is also not at all democratic, a federal agency can decide it needs something, and then just do it - in a very long and thorough procedure - and then government signs off on it or tosses it out. 

negotiations are generally kept secret to prevent political pressure and involvement other than the actual mandate given - if the plum producers of slovenia finds out, that slovenias plum production subsidies are going to get gutted, they may try to force the slovenian government to go out and publicly state that they will never support a policy that guts plum subsidies. With this in mind, negotiators now can't get rid of plum subsidies, that everyone except plum producers agree are a horrible idea, and they can't get the american negotiators to give up their plum tariff and reduce their pineapple subsidies, that would otherwise have allowed european pineapples to be competitive.

- Returning to the USA after fighting in Europe
- Marrying your sweetheart (whether or not she has been faithful in your absence is ambiguous - a big dramatic moment!) and moving to the suburbs

- Signing onto the GI bill, attending classes, and creating a better life for your family

- A QTE experience wherein you yell at your neighbor for trimming your hedges, only to discover that you both served - you become best friends and spent time at the lodge together.

- BBQlution - the next logical step in Levolution. This allows you to stage pleasant Hawaiin themed cookouts in your well appointed backyard. Steak? Hot Dogs? Burgers? You decide.

- Pleased to announce I have it on good authority that BF1946 will ship *with* horn support, so you can let your feelings be known as you drive at a comfortable 35 miles per hour in your neighborhood

As for is he going to be good after not coaching for a long time... I'm not going to be the guy that acts like JVG is this badass coach.

2,1462399456,pics,,0,1465585817,"It varied from culture to culture as well as periods of time. The Ancient Greeks (Mycenaean, think Iliad not Peloponnesian War) and Hittites used light chariots the same way as the pre-Roman Britons: rapid transport for chosen warriors who dismounted to fight--the ancient equivalent of motorized infantry. 

Ancient Egyptians on the other hand were largely recorded as using their (also light) chariots as mobile platforms for archers (the bow being the favored weapon of the Ancient Egyptians), a sort of precursor to the horse archer in a time when horses were generally still too small and technology/experience too lacking to warrant effective mounted combat. 

Later (like a couple thousand years later) the Persians seem to have developed the (heavier, armored) scythed chariot during the Greco-Persian wars (5th Century BC) that itself was utilized as a heavy war instrument designed to break the heavily armored Greek hoplite phalanx, rather than simply as a rapid mode of transportation for warriors. Basically the use of chariots as ancient ""tanks"", designed to utilize their weight, size, and menacing blades to shock the enemy, break apart their formations, and kill the enemy from within their broken and disorganized ranks--a role that would later be adopted by heavily armored mounted warriors upon the advent of the stirrup approximately 1000 years later.

Chariots were also used in India and China, playing a significant role in Indian mythology and being most notable in China as transportation for commanders (though they were also used as both fighting platforms and armored shock instruments by the Chinese, with limited success). It is important to note however that the use of chariots did not simply die at the end of the Classical era--they merely developed into new forms designed for new uses, most notably the ""war wagons"" of Central and Eastern Europe during the 15th-17th centuries. These were large armored wagons designed to carry crossbowmen and/or arquebusiers, equipped with firing slots and supported by infantry. During large engagements these wagons would be arrayed into large circles, creating mobile fortresses from which the defenders could fire on their enemy while protected from both the enemy projectiles as well as charges from infantry or cavalry. The Hussites were particularly notable for employing ""war wagons"" as such--though the practice spread throughout the militaries of Central/Eastern Europe during the era.

The use of horse-drawn carts/carriages/chariots in battle even endured into the 20th century in the form of Tachankas--machine guns mounted onto light 2 or 4 wheeled carts pulled by horses, used with devastating effect during the fast paced, mobile warfare of the plains and steppes of Eastern Europe during the Russian Civil War and Polish-Bolshevik War of 1921. They were even recorded as being used mid-gallop by fleeing forces on their pursuers--the 1920's version of the Parthenon shot.",t5_2qh0u,False,,1462213926,t1_d2p7wx2,t3_4hbsl5,0,2,d2pxq1r,,Jaquestrap

41,False,Suomi,,0,1465586005,"&gt; Could you give me a short description on how the biggest Finnish political parties are viewed by the Finnish people?

Sorted according to the number of seats:

- **Center - Keskusta:** Agrarian party whose lead has always ended in controversy. Has an obsession to ""keep the whole country inhabited"" at any cost; usually leads to severe consequences but they still try it every time. Our longest-serving president, bald dude with owl glasses, became a dictator by asking the Soviets to threaten us whenever an opponent of his would dare to question his position of power. Known for the phrase ""Kepu pettää aina."" (""Center will always betray."")

- **True Finns - Perussuomalaiset:** A right-wing populist party who rose to fame with sticking up for the poor, euroscepticism, and being anti-immigration. Now that they're in the government coalition, they cut from the poor, are OK with the EU, and are quick to change the topic when immigration is brought up. Now all of their voters hate them as much as the rest of us did all along. The whole party orbits around their leader, Jabba the Hut, but includes other lovable dorks, such as convicted islamophobe and alcoholic hillbilly.

- **National Coalition - Kokoomus:** Previous leading party but still in the new coalition as well. They got nothing done during their last term but they ran an election campaign with the slogan ""We need a corrective maneuver,"" yet they've somehow managed to achieve even less. They believe in privatizing everything they get their hands on, and so far they've cut student benefits and are forcing students to take loans so that ""they would have less debt."" Deeply conservative even though their leader tries to be hip and cool, and their youth section is famously anarcho-capitalist.

- **SDP:** An extension of the workers' unions. No character, no soul, just old men in suits with a century-old message of ""moar unionz."" It's a major party, but I can't come up with anything else. I mean, what is there to say?

- **the Greens - Vihreät.** As hip and cool as NC's leader wishes he was. Open to LGBT rights and asylum seekers but won't bring up the war on drugs. I mean, WTF? I'm counting on you, who else is going to question it if not you? Anti-nuclear because apparently electricity comes out of the socket. Vocal when in the opposition, but NC's parks department in the government. Used to be a small, insignificant party, but they're now creeping up in the polls.

- **Left Alliance - Vasemmistoliitto:** Low-key marxists with a soccer hooligan as their leader. Fails to appeal to the working class and has instead become a party for and of rich urban fundamentalists. Polls low, and its future depends on a young woman who is also a rich urban fundamentalist... and has probably never seen make-up.

- **Swedish People's Party - RKP:** Claims they are not a single-issue party for preserving the Swedish language in Finland but their other values are an error 404. Their leader was our previous Minister of Defense, funnily enough a dude who never went to the army. Surprisingly, he was pretty good and well-liked at his job.

- **Christian Democrats - KD:** A party advocating Christian shariah law. Their leader wanted to ban everything and that's become sort of a meme. No one likes them except people in crazy cults.",t5_2qlq3,False,flair-helsinki,1462214436,t1_d2pslxe,t3_4hfhrw,0,41,d2py4fz,Stadi,gerbaire

This is exactly why people indulge in language studies, so they could study literary pieces with other, likeminded individuals. When you're able to understand how language's evolved through the centuries, you regain the ability to appreciate it; for example, there's more to American-english accent in the corresponding day and age than *""The Revenant""* bothered to point out.

This exactly means that some, being *schollarly and written*, forms of proto-slavic languages were designed for a single purpose: to preserve the wealth of language. Our dramatic and turbulent history holds the evidence to this.  
Likewise in traditional Europe, the spoken language differed from the spoken dialect used by commoners. However, this didn't stop the language from getting *richer*; it was actually the oposite. Long story short, western slavic words along with russian, bulgarian, german, ottoman-turkish and many more are all written in *serbian cyrillic*, just like those of local origin.

When you've got such a difficult tincture, you can understand how it came to be that the infinitive form of some words originates from nouns and the other owe that heritage to verbs.

1,False,AskHistorians,,0,1465586600,"I did some independent research outside of this thread as well as went back and re-read and listened to my sources.  I missed a key word in my initial post.  Gibbon's works popularized the term, not invented it.  That said, the reasoning for it being called the Byzantium empire is as I said.  So the only incorrect part of that paragraph is arguably saying that Gibbon coined the word/phrase.

It also appears upon a cursory glance on the internet (Google) that coining a word/phrase is no longer just attributed to creating the word, but there is a relatively new definition of it being to popularize it as well.  I looked this up simply because I remember somewhere I read / heard from lectures, books, or brownsworth's Lost to the West promotional podcast the statement of gibbon coining the term.  Considering I just thought it meant inventing the word/phrase, it is a bit confusing heh.

That said, I do agree with my post being speculative due to the paragraph I pointed out earlier.  However I stand by the speculation being more in line with speculating on what the OP was asking more so than speculation of answering on my end.

In Dr. Harl's lecture ""Great Civilizations of Asia Minor"" (great courses series available at least on audible) he goes up until the fall of Constantinople for the history of the region of Anatolia, where he mentioned the extensive road systems in place during the period of the themes that allowed them to respond quickly to attacks.  Depending on your definition of ""Roman Roads"" which the OP never clearly stated, this is a source showing the use of Roman roads during a period as late as the theme system.  And considering population centers did not change with the fall of the western half, it would stand to reason that the road systems in place did not stop being used during the time period we consider to be the ""Byzantine empire"".  

Adrian Goldsworthy in his book ""How Rome Fell"" also covers briefly how it was not a sudden collapse that resulted in an instant shift from Roman rule to new rule and how there was a melding of the Germanic chiefdoms and Roman administration to come up with the rule of these new Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe and North Africa.  This implies the major population centers did not suddenly change and the road systems in place were not suddenly no longer in use.  Using this logic, you can assume that the half that survived as the Roman Empire in their own terminology did in fact still use the roads in place after they transitioned into the Byzantine age using our academic terms.

My speculation was along the lines of: not 100% sure if they used and maintained the old roads from the start to finish of the period we define as Byzantine history.  I can make educated guesses about the roads still being in use during at least the early part of Byzantine history, however again, based on the OP's question there is quite a bit of speculation in regards to what he is asking in addition to how specific you want to get in regards to various details of Roman roads.


Bit of a text wall at this point, but is this more in line with how my posts should be in the future?

They did, and in the long run it was one of the main factors to them both getting the sack.

 &gt;You think they would still have been one of the most successful clubs in Europe with a liability in such a pivotal position of the pitch?

They haven't won a single major trophy since Kroos joined the club two years ago. They haven't been CLOSE to ""one of the most successful clubs in Europe"" during Kroos's time as a defensive mid. That's just revisionism. 

They improved only after Zidane made the choice of benching James in favor of Casemiro, and slotted Kroos further up the pitch. As in, not playing Kroos where he doesn't belong, in defensive midfield.

1,False,Scotch,,0,1465586649,"This is a mystery dram from a pack of 3 such samples from Flaviar. Flaviar is a website that sells bottles and tasting packs of all sorts of spirits, some well known, and quite a few obscure ones. They’re a tad pricy but their shipping to here is very reasonable, and the tasting packs can be quite interesting, worth checking out.


This one turned out to be an from Glenfiddich. Everyone knows Glenfiddich and their 12 year old is one of the first stepping stones on many a whisky fan’s journey. I’m not a huge fan of their stuff (aside from the 14 year old Rich Oak), but I’ve always wanted to try this one. It’s matured for at least some of the time in a Solera. This is a method of maturation used primarily in making sherry where you have a set of tiered casks. Half of the bottom tier is bottled, and then refilled from the above tier, until you reach the top tier which is filled with new sherry. So you have some much older stuff floating around in each tier.

Glenfiddich started their solera vat in 1998, and I find it quite an interesting concept and am quite curious to see what this maturation method does to whisky. This isn’t really a tiered cask system, but a vat used at the end of maturation from which only half is bottled. Unfortunately no information is available as to just how much of the maturation time is spent in the solera vat.

**Aged 15 years. 40% ABV. Aged in European sherry casks and new oak casks.**

* **Nose:** Oranges. Oak. Apricots. Tile grout. Butterscotch. Some glue and acetone, not much. Light, clear honey (the industrial stuff). Golden delicious apples. Ginger biscuits.

* **Palate:** Apricots. Oranges. Woodspice….. hey where’d the flavour go?

* **Finish:** Short. Very short. Bit of dry wood, woodspice and apple tart.

**Would I buy this:** No

**Would I order this in a bar:** No

**Would I drink this if someone gave me a glass:** Yes

**VFM:** 3/5

I liked the nose on this, it was quite interesting, but as usually happens with low ABV, chill filtered whiskies, the flavour kind of fades away after that. This was still quite a bit more intriguing that their 12 year old, although I have a feeling cask influence is doing more for the flavour profile here than the solera vat. Still quite a generic Speysider though, there’s better fare out there for a similar price.

I don't see any of that being realistic in the political discourse. Sanders is taxed to be a crazy idealistic. But woow, loot at you :) 

I also find your position on the government pretty unsettling, but I guess it's cultural. I'm fine with it.

There is only one thing left: 

&gt; where my kids won't have to move to Luxembourg if they want to &gt; keep some of the money they earned.

Luxembourg apply the same tax rate on the individual as most of his neibourgs. There is no point to a individual to move to luxembourg. You need to be a corporation, then declare 100% of your profit in the country. Then have a special deal with the gov of luxembourg to be less taxed on this profit. ( The government is happy with a very small pourcentage, because whatever the amount , it's free money for the country) 

And, more conceptually than that. I find very disturbing the way you see tax. Tax day should be a great day. It's the day when we pay for the implementation of the decision we make together. Get that school build, get that teacher pay ( correctly ). 

I never felt stolen of my money when I filled tax. I alway find it was a pretty standard decent percentage of my income. A lot of people in France pays almost zero income tax, because they are too poor. 

Also, I discovered that the tax level in the US is not that low, you guys just get fucked compared to Europe. Right now I'm in the 25% tax bracket here. It start to be a fair amount of my income. But I'm use to it.... it's comparable to what I pay in France. 
But Oh gosh, for 25% in France you have no idea what luxury I have access to for free. 
Here? I have the right to support unfair drone strike in Pakistan. I'm also really concern about people living in bad neiboorhood a few block from me. Those people are fucked so a extends is not really possible to archive in France. ( Because public school are decent, you know it because even rich kids goes to public school ) 

Anyway, I'm ranting now. But this sentence really set me off. 
&gt; where my kids won't have to move to Luxembourg if they want to &gt; keep some of the money they earned. 

I own so much money ( figuratively ) to my country that I'm fine paying tax for a very long time. My education, the town where I grew up, my health, the health of my now older parents, the stability and total security of my surrounding....  gosh, oh gosh, I miss Europe.

&gt;* The goal of African Lion was to conduct joint, combined training that promoted interoperability and mutual understanding between the nations, and to strengthen the relationships that will enable them to work together effectively in the future.

&gt;* ""The beauty of bringing an organization like this together is that each individual country, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Department of Defense, have unique capabilities,"" said Col. Joseph Raftery, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force.

&gt;* The interactive exercise allowed the service members to collaborate with each other, which added to fulfilling objectives of African Lion, such as promoting regional cooperation and strengthening the militaries ability to respond to crisis.

&gt;* Bringing leaders and visitors together helps U.S. Africa Command and Marine Forces Europe-Africa maintain a strong military relationship with the Royal Kingdom of Morocco and other partners.

Example?

In fact the reverse is true and there are a number of cases when the US has cheated and backtracked.

For example, under the first Obama administration, the Turks and Brazilians (who were negotiating on behalf of the US) reached an agreement with Iran, only to see the US kill the deal by imposing additional demands *after Iran had said yes*. The Turks and Brazilians were so upset that they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just days earlier, endorsing the same deal terms:

https://web.archive.org/web/20141021151234/http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

It became obvious that the whole ""Iranian nuclear threat"" was pretextual, and that the US had no intention of allowing it to be resolved peacefully

http://garysick.tumblr.com/post/611735702/giving-the-finger-to-iran-and-turkey-and


The US also pressured the EU not to accept a perfectly reasonable deal offered by Iran which met all international requirements as well as their own promises to Iran

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html

There were a number of other cases that the US ignored or outright undermined any chance of a negotiated deal,

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html?_r=0

http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/when-ahmadinejad-questions-the-1.html

Why? Well *because the goal was always to impose regime change there* and the nuclear issue was always just a pretext, just as ""WMDs in Iraq"" was a pretext and a lie.




In fact the IAEA Director himself concluded this too:

&gt;I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges. http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

BUT

&gt;They weren’t interested in a compromise with the government in Tehran, but regime change – by any means necessary http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

Note that the Iranians were making *better* offers than what the US eventually negotiated with them. So by insisting on this policy not only did the US fail to get regime change, but actually rallied public opinion in Iran in favor of their govt's position on their nuclear program http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR910.html and led to iran expanding the nuclear program to produce fuel that the US cut off for a medical reactor that the US had given to Iran in the first place and which posed no proliferation threat http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/302492/a-primer-on-irans-medical-reactor/

And in the end Iran's economy emerged stronger as a result of the sanctions.

While it's very low in the modern western european countries, it's still not optimal. China for example has permanently hazardous air pollution in most places.

And even if you try very hard to live healthy, it's super hard. Even things labeled as organic have aditives, preservatives and other approved chemicals in them. Some of which are proven to be unhealthy, sometimes even carcinogenic.

If we could revert to the state that our planet was in before 1860, I think that the oldest living person would be 140 or even older.

Quem mantém o brasil no século 18 é a falta de indústria. A indústria poderia pegar essa matéria prima do campo com custo extremamente baixo (Já que não há custos de exportação envolvidos), agregar valor aqui no brasil, pra exportarmos o produto industrializado pelo menos parcialmente.

E quem mais é atrasado é o mundo petroquímico, exportamos algo tipo 240 milhões de barris de petróleo pesado, exportamos ele por US$ 10 bilhões. E como nossa industria petroquímica (Quase toda ESTATAL) só consegue lidar com petróleo leve, importamos 120 milhões de barris de petróleo leve por US$ 11 bilhões. Nesse caso é indústria defasada mesmo, não sabe lidar com o produto que tem.

(Os números não são bem esses, não lembro exatos mas a conversão mais ou menos essa, exportamos mais barris que importamos, mas importamos por um preço final (Do todo) bem maior)

No caso dos minérios, algumas industrias pegam minério nacional, industrializam, e exportam lingotes, mas as maiores tem sócios de fora que são seus maiores clientes. Ou seja, um japonês investiu em industria brasileira, lucra com isso aqui no brasil, vendendo aço pra ele mesmo no Japão por preço competitivo pra ele. O grosso ainda é exportação do minério quase in natura, sem valor agregado.

Nas commoditis agrícolas não há exportação de matéria prima e importação de industrializados, não importamos óleo de soja, nem tintas derivadas deles em quantidade, não importamos derivados de arroz ou carne, nessa parte o produto apenas sai, só volta muuuuuuito indiretamente na forma de pintura em produto industrializado ou coisa assim. No caso dos commodities agrícolas nosso atraso é deixar de industrializar ""uma parte dele"" aqui.

Mas os petróleo e minérios é como o século 18 mesmo, enviamos a matéria prima e depois importamos muito mais caro o produto industrializado (Ou no caso do petróleo, outro petróleo mais caro, que é o que conseguimos usar).

O pouco de indústria que tem no brasil anda até bem (Exceto nessa crise), mas temos em geral pouquíssima indústria, temos a matéria prima de origem vegetal ou animal na porta de onde poderia ter indústria, mas... o estado incentiva a exportação dela pra industrias a 12.000 km de distância da matéria prima, porque resolve de forma mais rápida a balança comercial.

O campo não industrializa nada, quem deve industrializar os produtos do campo é a industria, que... não existe (Ou não em número minimamente suficiente, talvez 2% do soja brasileiro é transformado em farelo, mas 98% é exportado sem que nenhuma industria agregue nem meio centavo de valor).

E o problema não é só falta de incentiva à indústria, porque no nosso patamar de atraso industrial precisaríamos importar muito equipamento pra tirar o atraso. Eu defendo que deveríamos industrializar hoje com processos simples (Pra exportar farelo de soja, óleo e torta, e não o grão) pois eles exigem tecnologia simples (Do século 19), pra que esse valor agregado aumentando os VALORES das exportações permitindo a importação de tecnologias mais complexas e caras. Ou seja, dar um passo moderado mas aplicar ele em TODA a produção agrícola, pra que ele permita um grande passo daqui 10 anos. Quero ver um governo de 4 anos pensar nisso! (O atual tem 13 (Número do azar) anos e só fez encolher a indústria ao invés de aumentar, imagina um governo de 4 anos).

This applied to Pegasi, especially in the wild, would mean that trying to catch Pegasi would be well near impossible for anyone who presented themselves as or seemed to be a threat.

Most soldiers, and men who would choose to become soldiers, were more like of the aggressive sort in an early european-ish society. Unlike normal horses, you can just catch Pegasi and break them in like it used to be done with horses. As a result it's very probable that the first Pegasi were tamed by women purely because. Most women in such a society was trained to be domestic, gentle, and most importantly, not very threatening allowing them to approach pegasi and establish a sort of co-existence.

Factoring cultural forces, generations of lore, and other such things, the idea of Pegasi only allowing women to ride them is probably very much a cultural myth.

the only game we have in our [database](http://www.gosugamers.net/overwatch/teams/14586-luminosity/matches) from you against creation is in the curse monthly tournament. having played in the tournament myself, i can tell you for a fact that despite the original rules stated 50/50 serverusage the whole tournament was played on na because of the eu lobby problems that night.

cloud9 doesnt play eu server tournaments either, that is true, but highly irrelevant because they are the best team in na (and possibly the world) right now and thus deserve an invite. unless you want to dispute that, then be my guest.

i'm aware you made roster changes and things have been going uphill for you since. i'm not trying to trash your team, but to put your performances in a context. i still included you within the top 6, just at the very bottom of the top 6 and still as second best north american team, which i think is a fairly fair representation of things currently. every other team i listed has better tournament placing then your team so far. including impulse 11. 

i dont rate teams purely on one tournament apperance, but rather look at their results over a longer period of time. elsewise, i would have included mydong in that list, wouldn't i?

Frederick II of the HRE even took land from Hungary in exchange for allowing Bela IV passage through his borders, and was locked in a dispute with the Pope, who'd excommunicated him. Pope Gregory II tried to install crusader fervor but found no favour with the HRE due to Frederick's intransigence on the matter.

Oddly enough, a purely German crusade under Conrad I had assembled post April 1241 and set out in July, but never made it out of German borders, and then the magnates leading it rebelled against the Empire which drifted into civil war.

Any further chance of a united Europe was forestalled by the Pope dying and then his successor dying within three weeks, leading to a vacant papacy for much of the period immediately after the conquest of Hungary.

And yes, a united Mongol imperial army never again threatened a Europe who had learned what it was facing. The last united actions under Monkhe were in Song China and the Near-East (Baghdad) all the way into Syria, whereby the Mongols retreated in 1260, leaving behind a smaller force which was defeated by the Mamluks at Ain-Jalut. Berke did once again invade Poland and Lithuania in 1259, wreaking destruction possibly in excess of 1241. But the civil war following the death of Monkhe cut any further moves short.

Thereafter the Golden Horde often faced off as much with the Ilkhanate as the Eastern Europeans, and despite repeated invasions of Hungary and Poland during and after the 1280's they failed to achieve lasting dominance of the region.

Right, what I'm saying is that it doesn't need to be repaid.

Right, again, there are causes here that are definitely not some irreversible momentum of destiny.

The country is developed, by literally EVERY poll the US leads most European countries in development index's, and ""income inequality"" doesn't exist. Middle class people being mad at rich people for being rich doesn't make things unequal. You just said the rich people have a right to their own wealth, then how is it inequality if they've managed to earn more than others? Anyone can become rich.

2,False,reddevils,,0,1465589479,"For that, and for the reason this whole season didn't plunge into a disaster - at least in terms of injuries - the reason may be that we were kicked out of the League Cup fairly early, then we were out both the CL and EL, leading once in a while to more time for players to recover (i.e. not having to play roughly two matches a week for extended periods). When we were active both in the League+Europe+FA Cup at the same time, we had the worst in terms of injuries (the contact injuries are obvious as to why, but so are the muscle-related problems). You can't rotate without sacrificing something with this squad depth, but at the same time you risk more injuries by doing that. There were players who got little to no rest as a result. So in a way we got off easily, only Schweinsteiger is out with ligament - but many hamstring injuries have also affected the overall performance of this year. Muscle fatigue plays a huge role in hamstring injuries, and so does mental fatigue (loss of concentration for a split second and one bad move is already enough). Some of the contact injuries can be also related to lack of coordination due to being tired - these are problems in many sports, but are more and more emphasized in football too. These are also the reasons why the German league has a winter break, and part of why this is brought up every year when the PL is plagued with injuries. Congested fixtures with this much physicality is not a good idea - even without that it is bad enough.",t5_2rxse,False,devil,1462223425,t1_d2q2non,t3_4hilhj,0,2,d2q5gvb,,noob_senpai
