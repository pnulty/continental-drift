However, you don't see any carrier-on-carrier engagements in either of those theatres, for the simple reason that neither the Germans nor the Italians completed an aircraft carrier. Additionally, the confined waters most of the actions in these theatres were fought in wasn't entirely conducive to the use of carriers. 

British carriers had a poor start to the war in the Atlantic. They were initially deployed as sub-hunters, a decision proved disastrously wrong by the sinking of HMS Courageous by U-29 on the 17th September 1939. HMS Ark Royal had a narrow escape three days earlier, taking near-misses from U-39. *Courageous*' sister ship *Glorious* would be sunk in April 1940 by the German battlecruisers *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau*. All they had to show for these two losses was a few aircraft kills, and a few merchants sunk. However, the Mediterranean Fleet's carriers would be a lot more successful in 1940. *Ark Royal* supported the British attack on the Vichy fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, with her aircraft incapacitating the battlecruiser *Dunkerque*. Carriers were repeatedly used to fly fighter aircraft to the besieged island of Malta, with *Argus* and *Ark Royal* participating in the first such operation at the start of August. Carriers were used to attack Italian airbases, as well as the ports of North Africa. *Ark Royal* participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, launching sorties against the Italian Fleet. However, the big success of British naval aviation in 1940 was the Raid on Taranto. Taranto was the major naval base in Southern Italy, home to much of the Italian fleet. Aircraft from HMS Illustrious (including part of *Eagle*'s air group) attacked the port during the night of the 11th-12th November. Three Italian battleships were sunk or heavily damaged, in return for two aircraft lost. However, just a couple of months later, *Illustrious* would be heavily damaged by German dive bombers while escorting a convoy to Malta.  

1941 saw the RN's carriers involved in two major surface actions. The first, in the Mediterranean, was the Battle of Cape Matapan. *Formidable*, supported the battleships and cruisers of the Mediterranean Fleet during this action, protecting them from air attacks. Her aircraft repeatedly attacked the Italian fleet, with one successfully torpedoing the Italian battleship *Vittorio Veneto*, while another hit the heavy cruiser *Pola*. The former would survive with heavy damage, while the latter was immobilised, and sunk in a nighttime surface action along with two of her sister ships. The second, in May, was the hunt for the *Bismarck*. The RN's carriers became involved after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, with *Bismarck* turning for home with the RN in hot pursuit. HMS Victorious' aircraft attacked her on the 24th, scoring one hit that caused only minor damage. Two days later, *Ark Royal*, following a sprint from Gibraltar, came into range. Her aircraft, following an accidental attack on HMS Sheffield, scored three hits. Two caused only minor damage, but the third jammed *Bismarck*'s rudder, allowing the RN's battleships to catch and sink her. 

Following these battles, the war began to calm down for carriers in Europe. The main usage in the Mediterranean was to support convoys to Malta, providing defence against air attack, and flying off fighters for the island. This was dangerous work, with both *Ark Royal* and *Eagle* being sunk by submarines, while *Indomptable* took heavy damage in an air attack. USS Wasp supported two of these operations, before being withdrawn to the Pacific. Carriers were also used to support amphibious operations, such as Torch and Husky. In Northern Europe, they were used for attacks against the Norwegian coastline, including attacks on the battleship *Tirpitz*.

Smaller escort carriers were also hugely important in the Battle of the Atlantic. These small, slow carriers, usually converted from merchant hulls, closed the 'air gap' in the mid-Atlantic (the area that couldn't be covered by land based aircraft from the US or UK). Aircraft could cover a much wider area than a surface ship, and respond much more quickly to sightings. They were also much more effective against surfaced submarines - submarines of this period tended to surface when not in battle, as they were faster on the surface, and it was more comfortable for the crew. Even if an aircraft didn't attack a submarine, it would force it to submerge, slowing it, and preventing it from reaching and attacking its target. Without the escort carriers, losses to submarines would have been much higher. ",t5_2ssp3

Well now that you mention it this was included in his last political testament also written in April 1945.

&gt;I have left no one in doubt that if the people of Europe are once more treated as mere blocks of shares in the hands of these international money and finance conspirators, then the sole responsibility for the massacre must be borne by the true culprits: the Jews. Nor have I left anyone in doubt that this time millions of European children of Aryan descent will starve to death, millions of men will die in battle, and hundreds of thousands of women and children will be burned or bombed to death in our cities without the true culprits being held to account, albeit more humanely.

The last sentence of the testament was this:

&gt;Above all, I enjoin the government and the people to uphold the race laws to the limit and to resist mercilessly the poisoner of all nations, international Jewry.

Hitler wasn't psychotic he was just ideologically devoted to a mind boggingly evil belief system. It doesn't surprise me that after spending years of his life obsessing over the Jews and ensuring their destruction on a continental scale he would mention them in his last will and testament.

You can say that war is bad, but there's been plenty of war throughout history. You could say that WWI was worse qualitatively due to machine guns and gas, but you could say the same thing with the introduction of firearms and the use of early forms of bio warfare (catapaulting plagued corpses, smallpox blankets, etc). Hell, it's arguable that war is even good for art in some cultures (e.g. look at the Greeks and The Illiad). So I don't buy into that view at all.

This seems extremely ignorant of all the sheer horror soldiers experienced during WW1. Some of them were mentioned by u/Handsomejack94 in his reply, but there are other major things to consider as well. For example the Great War is the first war between major powers after the concept of an armed populace (brought to the European attention after what the French did past their revolution) meaning that there were more troops than ever on the field of battle. It lasted longer than any war had lasted before, and was marred by a constant negligence of what had previously been seen as rules of engagement (take for example the very thing that brought Great Britain into the war - the Germans attacking neutral Belgium who refused to surrender their landmass for the flanking portion of the German force) both in terms of diplomacy, but also in terms of how the war was fought. 

Do you think the common soldier knew what mustard gas was before he saw it creeping across no-man's land into the lungs of comrades who convulsed and choked to death on what moments earlier had seemed a mere fog? Comparing it to biological weapons of the past seems entirely impossible to me. What war had people living in their own shit for entire years, fighting an enemy they had no more a quarrel with than their nation put into their backpacks upon leaving home? What other war saw an entire generations of soldiers slaughtered upon dirty gray fields, with no possibility of sending their bodies home or even digging graves in the muddy moats of battle? Machine guns were no devilish device upon those grounds! Nay, they were a mercy upon that wretched wreck of a soldier who was lucky enough to graze one of its bullets.

Have you heard of shell-shock? Do you think shell-shock was a condition before The Great War? It was not. Soldiers were executed by **their own comrades** in firing squads because they were so immensely traumatized by the horrors around them they had problems simply moving, let alone obeying orders. Ever heard of the thousand yard stare? Take a look at [this famous photograph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Shellshock2.jpg) and tell me that the man in the lower right is able to comprehend his current situation, and then try yourself to imagine the abhorrence that can drive a man *out of the world like that*.

When the man commanding the German army grew so distressed he was removed from his position, the man who took over told that massive imperial force to dig in their heels and rain hell down on the French and British soldiers pursuing them. He was more than convinced they had already lost the war, but that country was at the mercy of an emperor who was **so damn incompetent on the field of battle they cancelled the annual war games a year before the war began**. This fight that had seemed a year's curse lasted for four more, and as the desperation grew on the *home-front* the war crimes seemed only to multiply on that perennial trench that divided Western Europe with the bitter stain of ancient blood.

Yet it did not stop there. Ask an Australian about the Gallipoli Campaign. Ask him about the ""war-hero"" Churchill who sent colonial troops into a literal minefield where what was thought to be invulnerable capital cruisers blew up before they even knew what was happening, and the poor conscripts hauled from halfway across the world where haphazardly dropped on humid beaches to either be gunned down as they landed, or get pinned down watching their friends rotting corpses being devoured by insects as they fought against Turkish troops that would yield neither ground nor life to any foe. I quote the commander of the Turkish troops' famous words for the 57th Infantry Regiment that had run out ammunition and only had their bayonets left to fight the enemies climbing the slopes towards them: ""I do not order you to fight, I order you to die. In the time which passes until we die, other troops and commanders can come forward and take our places"".

This, all this, is even without mentioning the eastern front. Where the massive Russian Army was so poorly equipped there were unarmed soldiers instructed to follow an armed soldier around and wait for him to die so that he could take his weapon. The Russians left home to fight for what in truth was a starving nation, with the armaments of an army half their size, and were utterly devastated by the much smaller German force sent to meet them (Germany were at this point hoping to have crushed the French and have their main force shifted eastwards, but due to what would be known as the **Rape of Belgium**, and the stalemate on the western front, they had to make do with a smaller garrison).

I think I disagree with u/Handsomejack94 on the most shattering year being 1914, for it was most certainly 1918, when a whole generation of soldiers stayed behind on the fields of Somme, Verdun and Passchendaele, the only stones marking their graves being the grass that started to creep out from below the ashes of the past century having burned itself out.

You asked us why historic events should change our aesthetic values. I for one see not how art could ever have remained the same when the rest of our world shattered. What strength did beauty give to those staring their fathers across fields of rotten pride? What sympathy did it offer those who lost their sons to sulfur? Dadaism, and similar styles of art, did not abandon guidelines because they found them constraining. **They abandoned the rules because the rules abandoned them, and no previous design could frame the world that they woke up to.** 

I leave you only with a quote from another Ulysses that has always stuck with me: **""Who are you, that do not know your history?""**. ",t5_30xom

 - ""When the axe came into the woods, many of the trees said 'At least the handle is one of us.'""
 - Scotland has limited control over its tax laws - it still can't set a VAT rate, it still can't abolish the bedroom tax (only recompensate affected people), etc. - and even then, the tax powers it does have were only granted very recently. Could you imagine how much Westminster politicians would be baying for blood if the EU declared that the UK VAT rate was going to be decided by the EU parliament, and not by the Westminster parliament?
 - Scotland has stunted representation, because of its status as a component of a sovereign state rather than being a sovereign state itself - this takes effect in fewer seats in the EU parliament (where countries with smaller populations are generally disproportionately represented, and where Scotland, as a result of its membership in the UK, has the same number of seats as *Luxembourg*), no representation in the UN assembly (where even the Vatican and Palestine have observer status, despite not being members), no representation in NATO (despite Scottish military resources being contributed to and available for NATO operations/projects), and so on.
 - The larger nation having fewer voters per MP doesn't justify it having, in effect, total control of the parliament, by the number of MPs dwarfing the number of all other MPs combined. *This democratic deficit is not something that can be fixed by legislation or reformation.* This is an inherent problem of one country being tacked onto a much larger (by population) country.
 - Not all Scots vote SNP. Not all English people vote Conservative. But not once in the last century (almost certainly longer, but the further back, the harder and longer to check) has the result of the Scottish vote within Westminster elections changed the result. The party in control has always been the party in control, regardless of which party Scotland voted for. This isn't a single constituency we're talking about. *This is an entire nation-state*, and one of the primary members of the UK, with shared politics, history, language, culture, etc. Again, this is not something that can be solved fairly through legislation or reformation, this is an inherent problem in tacking countries with vastly different population sizes together.

Scotland has severely stunted international influence on the world - little EU representation, no UN or NATO representation, little representation at various international summits where it would otherwise have, etc. - and what representation it does have, such as in various climate-change summits, it's had to fight with common-sense in one hand and sheer determination in the other. A wife whose husband insists on saying everything for her and tries to control who she speaks to what she says may have more to say than what her husband insists she does.

""Throwing the baby out with the bath water"" is a specific phrase that was constantly repeated by the 'No' parties leading up to the referendum - and considering independence is a grasp at what we don't have - fairness with other countries, the right to make our own decisions as best suit us, both nationally and internationally, the ability to govern and manage our own resources (which even knowledge of is hidden from us, as clearly shown in things like the McCrone Report) - it's more akin to saving the baby, to reviving the baby.",t5_2qkli

The classlessness was a result of the highly horizontal communal structure (they actually didn't know what ""family"" meant in the modern sense), which itself produces more genetic homogeneity.

&gt;Why do you think it's impossible to prevent this in a communist society?

Because there's no mechanism to enact precise eugenic pressure, like there is in patrilineal monogamous cultures.

&gt;Why would they not give in to nepotism?

The groups were more outbred and dynamic to reorganizations in their war band.

&gt;Why would it not descend into a lame old bureaucracy?

Too many warriors too ready to kill a bureaucrat type.

&gt;How is it decided that one is higher status?

Investments into commons, which open up productive Schelling point potentials.  Aristos are actually the progenitors of robust markets and deeply cooperative polities.

&gt;and earned it through our virtus.
&gt;&gt;What does this entail?

Great personal excellence, which itself has relevance to political economy in the sense of less of a need to parasitically liquidate commons investments.

We think much of the heroic grandiose behavior of Indo-Europeans was centered around this dynamic of creating cues to others that they could organize around it and mutually profit.  This sort of playing with death could be interpreted as a complex development out of the immense profits of human cooperation, so much so that genetic vehicles can afford to end themselves, because their cultural evolutionary strategies are so productive.

Of course, there's the Nietzschean and Evolian explanations for virtue, but for a purely materialistic audience, the above suffices.

&gt;Why does there have to be a state?

Call it what you want.  It is a republic, but it's not rent-seeking.

&gt;You don't need hierarchy to exalt greatness.

Actually status does imply momentary differentials.

&gt;People can still prove themselves to be exceptional human beings without needing to rule over another.

Well, this isn't a petty Hegelian master-slave dichotomy.

LONG POST but please read; there are 3 questions in there in bold.

Here are a couple of fun facts about Iran:

- We have public universities and if you ~~pass~~ excel your entrance exam (called the Konkoor, which is a french word and is as hard as an SAT test), you can go to university for FREE!  Passing it won't do anything. It depends on the relative competition. It involves a lot of subjects, it doesn't matter whether you are an art major or a med major (no pre-med in iran), YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING FROM EVERY SUBJECT TAUGHT TO YOU EVER. 

- Unlike popular belief, our women drive and and attend university. [70% of STEM students in Iran are Women.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/amyguttman/2015/12/09/set-to-take-over-tech-70-of-irans-science-and-engineering-students-are-women/#176502665870) Our STEM field is probably the second strongest in the region (Israel is first). 

- One thing I like best is our ability to make our own technology under severe sanctions. Since 1979, Iran has been put under sanctions by the USA and the EU and plans to remove them for the first time was set for 2016. As a result, we have persevered and improved in our STEM fields to create domestic technologies to compensate for shortages.

**Question: How is education in your country?**


- Music and underground culture (fasten your seatbelts!):

I would like to say that Iranians have a huge underground music scene because the allowed music scene is limited to Males as lead singers and very generic songs. The Arian band is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKc8W6ncO20. Bonus, this exact same band sang a song with Chris De Burg and they wanted to do an album but the Ministry in Iran did not permit them. Here's the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGvLsUYhJ4. Of course, other types of music allowed are traditional, folk and poetry. 

Here's an example of Iranian folk music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92mVoinVUcg
 
The Iranians, since the revolution, love to imitate western cultures. As a result, there is a huge underground culture. Most of them are veiled and you must knock on a door to see what's inside. Metaphorically, of course. Usually, what happens behind closed doors is left alone. That's why when you come to an Iranian community on the internet, they like to stay anonymous. You would see 1980's fashion behind closed doors during the 1980's, for example. It's all veiled and is difficult to see especially with all the negative light the media is showing us to be. Many Iranians that become successful and gain fans from everywhere, leave the country and usually settle in L.A. where both the Iranian community is big and where their music industry is located.

First, someone can become so famous that they're known by just their first name. Such is the case with Napoleon. Same goes for people today if their first name isn't very common. If you said ""West"", ""O'Neal"", or ""Barr"", you might not know who I'm talking about but ""Kanye"", ""Shaq"", or ""Roseanne"" are immediately recognizable. We typically call famous political leaders by their surname, but there's nothing stopping us from referring to Obama as simply ""Barack"", for example. 

So in Napoleon's case, as the other commenter mentioned, he was referred to as ""Bonaparte"" until he crowned himself king and thus, ""Napoleon I"" though even before that, there hadn't really been a famous Napoleon before so ""Napoleon"" was more than enough, and the convention has stuck.

Now, the other part that probably better answers your question. (This is confined to European history. The Asian timeline on this topic is different):

Surnames as we know them in Europe and the Americas are a relatively recent invention. There's some evidence they were being used as early as the 900s in Ireland, but they didn't really take off until the Norman invasion of England in 1066. In the aftermath, the upper class noble Normans who stayed in England started using a second name referring to a place back in Normandy, and it became hereditary throughout the generations. ""The Domesday Book"" from 1079 shows that this was happening among the upper class, but lower class people still went by just a first name. 

By the end of the 1300s, the convention had reached all English classes as well as French-speaking people back on the continent, too. Scotland and Ireland adopted surnames universally not long after; the Welsh were a bit of holdouts but they eventually joined the club. By 1500, it's safe to say that if you spoke French, or you lived anywhere in the British Isles, you were using a fixed surname, even if you were the poorest peasant in the land.

In most of the rest of Europe, surnames came later. They caught on in Italy and Spain during the 1500s. In the Netherlands, they didn't happen until 1811 (when the country was occupied by Napoleon who ordered a civil registration). In Germany, it happened piecemeal due to its varied regional history. Bavaria, for example, was using fixed surnames by the 1600s, while Schleswig-Holstein didn't make them mandatory until a final decree in 1822. 

The last holdouts against fixed surnames were the Scandinavian countries: Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. They really weren't completely universal until about 1900.

Before the use of fixed surnames, last names worked very differently. (And they still work this way in Iceland today.) Last names, if you had one, were patronyms, i.e., your father's first name. If your name is William and your dad's name is John, you're William Johnson. But your kids' last name will be Williamson. Two different last names in the same household.

The problem local populations ran into with this custom is that there would be several people in the same area with the same first and last name. So people were assigned a *second* last name called a ""cognomen"". So there might be a ""William Johnson the White"" and ""William Johnson at the Woods"" in the same town. Your children would typically be assigned your cognomen in their early adulthood, but would routinely be given a new one if a more suitable description arose. For example ""William Johnson Atwood""'s son ""David Williamson Atwood"" might become ""David Williamson Hill"" once he got land of his own and moved away from the woods or ""David Williamson the Smith"" if he became a blacksmith, etc.

So why am I telling you all this? Because unless you were English or French before about 1500, you didn't have a true fixed surname like we use today. In your example, Hannibal's last name ""Barca"" isn't a true fixed surname. It's a cognomen that meant ""lightning"". Because they were a prominent family, his sons were tagged with the same cognomen, but it changed after just a couple generations.

All these historical Europeans are thus usually referred to by their first name (""Hannibal"") or first name plus cognomen (""Alexander the Great"", ""Edward the Confessor"", ""Ivan the Terrible""), because this is typically how they would have been referred to in their time, and it has stuck with them throughout history.

In the case of ""Alexander the Great"" and ""Edward the Confessor"", both living pre-1066, they simply didn't have any patronymic or ""fixed surname"" style last name. First name and cognomen only. 

By the time of ""Ivan the Terrible"", he did have a patronymic last name (""Vasilyevich"" -- he was son of Vasiliy III) though his ""cognomen"" was more useful in setting him apart from his predecessors. His grandfather, Ivan III of Russia, was also ""Ivan Vasilyevich"" at birth, so by using first name plus patronymic last name just becomes confusing as to which ""Ivan Vasilyevich"" you're referring to. 

And this extends to non-poltical figures as well. ""Da Vinci"" in Leonardo's name is a cognomen meaning ""of Vinci"". His full name is ""Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci"" meaning ""Leonardo, son of Piero, of Vinci"". We could call him ""Leonardo di ser Piero"", and his friends and neighbors assuredly did. But for the rest of Italy, where many other towns had a ""Leonardo di ser Piero"" of their own, it was much more useful in calling him ""Leonardo da Vinci"", which, by extension, is how he came to be known throughout Europe. ""Not Leonardo, Piero's son, who lives down the street. Leonardo *of Vinci*.""

**TL;DR:** Fixed surnames as we know them today didn't become universal in most of Europe until the 1600s, and some places in northern Europe until the 1800s. And Iceland still hasn't adopted them. Before that, surnames were ever-shifting patronyms and/or a person-specific cognomen. Patronymics aren't particularly useful outside of a person's local community, so these historical figures are typically referred to by first name only, or first name plus cognomen.

People oftentimes blame Bismarck's ""damned system of alliances"", but if we're honest with ourselves, that ""damned system"" was the lasting legacy of Bismarck's sheer genius as a political thinker, and kept the peace by and large in a Europe fraught with contending factions and nations reeling from the social turmoil of the industrial revolution and massive population issues for more than 20 years after his retirement.

Prussia/Germany was unfortunately lead by Kaiser Wilhelm II, and he had been itching for a war with pretty much anyone for nearly the entire 25 years by the time WW1 broke out.

It's really , in my opinion the case that Bismarck's systems did nothing but forestall the war the had been brewing from the 1890's. 

What really is fascinating to me is that - we could consider it a 100 year war because practically, WW1, WW2 and the Cold War basically all fed into one another. I suspect in 200 or 300 years, we'll see them properly as the colonial/industrial resource wars they were. 

There's a great book on the subject of Eisenhower and Marshall and their mentor Fox Conner called ""Partners in Command"", [Connor] immediately after WW1 tells them both , there is going to be another war, it's going to be in Belgium/France , involving Germany and it's going to be a tank war - he set about teaching them how to win that war - in 1918.",t5_2qh1i

**I specifcally want help figuring out how to fight melasma/PIE/acne/ageing simultaneously, clearing up current break out, and wondering if I can use Kojie-San in any way**

I'm in my early 40s and have suffered from acne since adolescence. I am going through a real break-out phase right now, thought it was purging but ... 3 weeks ago I got some Kojie-San soap and used it TWICE a day ... skin looked fantastic for a few days - I also switched out my Stridex maximum for CosRx blackhead power (I know ... one thing at a time). I was so thrilled at the dramatic change I continued even with having changed multiple steps at the same time. Then about a week ago I broke out in about 10 large pimples/cysts, mostly on my t-zone which is always where my clogs and acne show up, but also a few on my cheeks which are usually mostly acne free.

I figured it was not just a purge and that maybe the Kojie-San had damaged my acid mantle, so I immediately stopped using it, but continued with the CoxRx BHA.

It's been about a week since I ceased using the Kojie-San, and my skin has not really got a lot better, and the clogging seems about as bad as ever. My birth-control induced melasma, having at first improved with the Kojie-San, seems to be back to its old intensity.

I'm considering going back to my Stridex or even back to Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%. 

How long should I keep on with the CosRx BHA before giving up and trying something else? Or should I add something? 

I'm also interested in figuring out whether there is some way of getting the Kojie-San soap to work for me. I have pH strips and tested it, so I know it's got too high a pH. Is there some way that I can adjust the pH - e.g. by mixing it with another acid (I have citric and lactic acids). Thought maybe I'd make a solution of the soap with distilled water and then add acid until the pH hit 5.5. Is it possible that this could work?",t5_2w0u7

[In  Europe  and  the  U.S.,  two  distinct  phenomena;  long-term  declines  in  colony  numbers  and increasing annual colony losses, have led to significant interest in their causes and environmental implications. The most important drivers of a long-term decline in colony numbers appear to be socioeconomic and political pressure  on  honey  production.  In  contrast,  **annual  colony  losses  seem  to  be  driven  mainly  by  the  spread  of introduced pathogens and pests, and management problems** due to a long-term intensification of production and  the transition  from  large numbers  of  small apiaries  to fewer,  larger operations.  ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496582)

[The most likely encountered high range of field doses [of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid] relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0118748&amp;hc_location=ufi)

&gt;When companies like Monsanto make better, improved GMO crops, they also add a gene from crops resistent to Glyphosate, a chemical weed-killer. 

Glyphosate is much safer than the alternatives, and is applied at a lower dose. Yield increases obtained from HT crops mean that less farmland is needed --- resulting in fewer emissions, less water use, less habitat destruction, and happier farmers.

&gt;Glyphosate will easily pollute groundwater, water streams and soils if not managed properly.

[The compound is so strongly attracted to the soil that little is expected to leach from the applied area. Microbes are primarily responsible for the breakdown of the product. The time it takes for half of the product to break down ranges from 1 to 174 days. Because glyphosate is so tightly bound to the soil, little is transferred by rain or irrigation water. One estimate showed less than two percent of the applied chemical lost to runoff ](http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/dienochlor-glyphosate/glyphosate-ext.html)

&amp;nbsp;

[Our conclusions are: (1) although there is conflicting literature on the effects of glyphosate on mineral nutrition on GR crops, most of the literature indicates that mineral nutrition in GR crops is not affected by either the GR trait or by application of glyphosate; (2) most of the available data support the view that neither the GR transgenes nor glyphosate use in GR crops increases crop disease; and (3) yield data on GR crops do not support the hypotheses that there are substantive mineral nutrition or disease problems that are specific to GR crops.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479986/)

It's more nuanced than that. It seems Europeans tend to be more open about their anti-immigrant or racist opinions but when it comes to legislation, those issues aren't major topics like they are in the US. So while many European countries might be more racist than the US, their laws might not show it . It's a complicated issue

Because what we would be looking for technology wise, wouldn't be when something was invented.  Instead we would look for when a technological advancement actually ""trickled down"" to European commoners.  

Example: The ""modern"" flushing toilet was invented in 1596, but didn't become really widespread until maybe the late 19th century.

Edit: I did not add this in just because of the immense complexity in the answer (as in entire books are written on the subject) but now it seems it should at least be mentioned.

  The technological advancement that would most likely hit commoners first would be warfare technology.  Following the progression of not just cannons and gunpowder from Asia, but also the ability to forge better combinations of steel and iron, and how the build of different weapons changed through these years is something that a number of historians look at today.  **However** despite this most likely being the technology with the greatest geological and economic diaspora, it was not (as others have discussed on this thread already) something that commoners would necessarily be upbeat about. 

 I would reference the reactions soldiers had to the new weaponry (particularly chemical weaponry) in WWI/The Great War as the standard for how commoners would have reacted to the appearance of canons; these would NOT be happy reactions. In fact it would most likely be reactions of horror to what would befall their fellow commoner soldiers and themselves.

America's strategy requires it to spend enormous sums of money in every region (not necessarily all that efficiently). It's military spending is abnormal while Europe's is normal. In terms of concentration of firepower, a Unified Europe is more powerful than anywhere bar the US, and more than capable of deterring attack. It has Nuclear weapons, large standing armies and is technologically advanced compared to all remotely credible threats. 




America spends about $600B on its defense - non US NATO countries spend $320B - more than four times Russian spending and about twice China's spending (UK and France spend about $60B each to Russia's $80B. Germany spends over $40B). Non-US active NATO military personnel are 2 million to America's 1.37 Million. Until recently America's strategy was to be able to fight and win on two fronts simultaneously. That is an incredibly expensive undertaking and requires enough money for offense in the East, offense in the West, Home Defense and spending on strategic allies (big recipients are Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel ect - NOT EU countries). Considering the rest of NATO spends about half of as much as the US, has more active military personnel AND isn't trying to project power overseas, fight offensive wars (military contributions by non-US NATO members to Wars such as Afghanistan and Iraq were pretty marginal and relied on US) or fight simultaneous wars it could be argued that Europe is one of the most militarised regions on the planet.


The other argument is that America pours billions into R and D that Europe th en uses and ia thus subsidised by. This is totally not true. In the post war peruod  the US with held nuclear technology from the Uk (despite Uk contributing significant dillars and scientists to the Manhattan project). The Uk and France both went on to develop and extensively test nuclear weapons on their own.


In fact France, Uk and Germany have all self developed jets, battle tanks, submarines (including nuclear versions) , aircraft carriers and other other arnourments. Various versions of which have often been considered superior to Us and Russian equivalents. In reality,  the recent moves to intergrated systems has come about because of compatibility issues within the longstanding NATO alliance. Despite this recent push to collaborate on major new iterations of jets there are still very military manafacturers throughout Europe that are very competitive on the world stage. Eg France just won  a $40 billion contract for Australia's new generation of submarines. Australia is a close Us ally and had big dollars to spend - France had the best proposal for aussie needs (biggest non-nuclear subs - converted from current French nuclear submarine designs)

Localization changes happen for a number of reasons. The first is different cultural meaning to certain assets, which get changed so that they reflect the same thing in others. For example, the various Japanese dishes in the Japanese release of Kirby Super Star on the SNES was changed for the European and North American release of the title to use foods like Hot dogs and hamburgers.

When they changed the food items in Kirby Super Star to western foods (Hamburgers, hot dogs, popcorn, etc.) from the original Japanese foods, the change was made so that the intent of the original assets would be understood in the same way.

Looking up some of the changes to Fire Emblem:Fates the changes appear to be very similar in purpose; removed elements are removed because the cultural norms are different between the target markets In particular, Homosexual and same-sex relationships have wildly different cultural contexts, and some dialog was changed or removed as a result.

The reason it is such a big issue for that game is that a good portion of the fans are, as I understand the term, Otaku; As a result, they have a better grasp of the Japanese context for the original content. Now, in contrast, somebody like myself who doesn't, sees content like the part where a female character is cured of their infatuation with other female characters by having a magic powder applied that makes them see everybody as the opposite sex as rather silly. I mean, to me, it doesn't make much sense. 

But, to somebody familiar with Japanese culture and anime and such, it's normal because evidently all main characters carry gender-dysmorphic powder everywhere. So while for me it makes no sense, to them, it's perfectly reasonable, and it only happens once, unlike in Chuppa chuppa Nichi-nichi deluxe happy team where it happens each episode, or whatever.

The thing is that the localization teams involved are localizing for a locale at large, not for particular subsets of that locale; So while an Otaku (or heaven forbid, a weeaboo) finds these changes distasteful because they remove the sort of gibberish that they are so used to seeing in Japanese Anime, the general population is relieved from the burden of having to understand why items materialize out of nowhere and get used throughout a conversation or why we are able to treat other people like a Tamagotchi.",t5_2qhnk

&gt;The reason is that China and Russia are seeking to increase their relative power through regional revisionism, especially through the use or threat of military force in the pursuit of territorial gains. States in East Asia and Europe have therefore interpreted Chinese and Russian revisionism as major security threats and responded by strengthening the U.S. alliance systems in their respective regions. The result is an increase in the United States’ political influence and military presence in East Asia and Europe, and the continuation of the unipolar moment.

Which is pretty much a spot-on assessment of the situation. As China and Russia push harder to establish themselves as regional hegemonies, their neighbors will respond by seeking more support from the United States. Even a successful use of this policy on behalf of China or Russia further alienates them from neighboring states and, ironically, makes it more difficult to attain their ultimate goal. ",t5_2qhnn
8,t3_4h7i6o,0,t3_4h7i6o,1462086464,europe,ByzantineBasileus,Ancient and Medieval Warfare | Byzantine History,d2o7ga1,1465556210,0,,1462096024,AskHistorians,8,False,"I was literally born for this question! I did my thesis on the 12th century Byzantine army!

Very different in some ways, but in others very similar. 

I am fully aware that this answer is both accurate and completely unhelpful.

The Byzantine army in the 10th and early 11th century was based on a mix between a standing force based around the capital called the Tagmata. This consisted of both cavalry and infantry, and being a standing force was most likely well armoured and equipped. The other part of the army was provincially based. A Byzantine province at this time was called a Theme, and soldiers had their own land there which provided the income for them to obtain their own equipment and allow them to train. Such solders were essentially a reserve to be called up for campaigns as required.

By comparison, the Komnenid Byzantine army seems to have been a standing force, with troops paid directly by the central government and stationed both in the capital and in the provinces. This excerpt from the Alexiad of Anna Komnena supports this:

&gt;""Whilst on his way to Thessalonica, where the contingents from all the various districts were assembled, he thought it would not be amiss to hold a review of the troops drawn up in battle array.""

The reference to troops from various districts seems to refer to garrison troops rather than thematic reserves as they were called up straight away on a campaign. There is another reference to troops being installed as a garrison rather than as a militia holding land:

&gt;""The Emperor had already thought of this and anticipated Bohemund's plan by sending the eunuch Eustathius (whom he promoted from the rank of Canicleius {= The keeper of the red ink used for imperial signature} to Great Drungaire of the fleet) with orders to occupy Curicum with all speed. Further he was to rebuild it quickly, and the fort Seleucia as well, which was six stades distant, then leave an adequate garrison in each and appoint Strategius Strabus Duke over them, a man of small body, but of long and varied military experience.""

However, there was a trend in the late 11th century to move away from the thematic system and switch to paid, full-time garrisons, so the Komnenid army should be seen as the fulfilment of this process, rather than a straight departure from the thematic army.

There is a common assumption that the 12th century Byzantine army was reliant on foreign mercenaries. Complete bullocks. The bulk of the army was mostly natives, with West Europeans mainly operating as heavy cavalry in certain elite regiments, and some levied troops providing specific services like horse archers. The emperor John Komnenos settled the defeated Kumans within the empire on condition of them providing soldiers when required.

In terms of weapons and armour the only major changes was that Byzantine heavy cavalry was rearmed and retrained to fight in the West European tradition, as described by the Byzantine writer John Kinnamos.

Otherwise, in terms of organization, tactics and weapons the army was not so different from the 10th century version. It still used heavy-armed troops with lights troops in support, it maintained both light and heavy cavalry and still used fortified encampments when on the march. All the descriptions in the works of Anna Komneoa, Niketas Choniates and John Kinnamos of equipment and troops in action match those found in military manuals like *On Skirmishing* and *Campaign Organization and Tactics*.

Obviously he couldn't expect to be forgiven by the victim or his family, but in the eyes of the many people in society, he would have paid his proverbial debt to society. Killing him outright robs that kidnapper's chance (however minute) at rehabilitation and the society's ""right"" to see him punished according to established legal norms and ultimately reformed.

The ultimate goal of a prison system *should* be this.  Once they're truly repentant, they no longer need to be behind bars.  Many European countries have systems like this and while there are definitely issues with it (extremely light sentences for heinous crimes being one of them), I think it's in the right direction.

People can change.  Someone who committed a serious crime could reform and become someone who contributes meaningfully to society.

And I just sort of moseyed out into the audience to watch Avicii spin from their point of view. I would go back and forth between the backstage and the VIP area and then where the actual kids were. And most people didn’t know who the fuck I was in Ibiza except for this one guy who recognized me. He was like, ‘Are you Mike Posner?’ and he was all excited.

1. Though your example was a good one to show how beneficial diplomacy can be in EU IV, that is about it. The diplomacy in EU IV has been reworked so much since Vanilla that it is almost unfair to compare it to the pretty barebone system we get with Stellaris.

2. We saw in the stream that another member of the Federation is able to pull you into their war, even if only they benefit from it. Furthermore as we have seen in the stream (although that might have been a bit buggy) it is possilbe you have to skip your turn in leading the federation and therefore expanding on your own, because you are still in a previous war the AI started for the duration of your term. I guess that is what /u/Throwaway-tan was talking about and I'd say that is a valid complaint. As the OP, /u/OriginalBadass pointet out, that is not unlike beeing allied in EU IV with a nation that goes to war, while you are under a regency council yourself and - unlike in EU IV - you are not even able to go for a seperate peace in Stellaris.

3. We know from EU IV however that with the newer expansions you can at least set a sphere of influence and hope for the AI to give you at least something. Wiz did mention in the stream that the AI probably did not consider the Blorg in the war of the federation due to the Blorg already being pretty big compared to everyone else in the federation. I hope this consideration of relative powers within the federation the AI does, for determining the war goals in Stellaris, works in a similar fashion than the spheres of influence in EU IV do these days (and I'd assume Wiz should know stuff about the AI).

4. The only thing left to say is that in my opinion /u/imnotgood42 was right when he wrote, that a Federation should have it's drawbacks, especially for strong nations. If it were me, I would not have joined the ""Frienderation"" with the Blorg. They were to strong and the alliances were sufficient to keep them afloat in case of a war with another group of aliens.

To educate you, Arabs are genetically distinct to whites and their parent haplogroups are variously J1 and EB1, not R1b like whites. Arabs are thus as white as East Asians are white. The only whites are the Europeans. No white and European man could survive, let alone emerge, under the scorching hot sun of the Arabian deserts (or in the deserts of my own nation). That should have been your first clue.

You say that, but when I looked that up it said its found in Southern Europe as well as the Middle East... And it pretty much stops at North Africa. It's also found among Jewish people and I look pretty Jewish. Not a whole lot of people I do think would say a Jewish person isn't white. I just don't look European white.

You are right, criminality is universal, but Islam is a totalitarian political ideology, it is not just a religion, it's a complete way of life, that is incompatible with a secular liberal democracy! And you ought to familiarize yourself with this concept before it's too late. You can say anything you want about Christians, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus, etc. But the only religion you cannot question without fear of repercussion is Islam. Anybody outside the faith voices their opinions are labelled as Islamophobe. Anybody tries to question what is in the Qur'an, his/her opinion gets instantly disregarded because s/he doesn't speak the particular obscure dialect of Arabic the book was written on, or s/he didn't grow up in the middle east to understand to context, or s/he has not studied the text with world leading scholars, therefor s/he has no authority to criticize. So who is an example as a true authority on Islam; a man who can read the Qur'an and the Hadith? who grew up in the Middle-East and studied the texts with islamic scholars and clerics? Let's say, someone who holds a PhD in islamic studies perhaps?.... Enter; Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. 
Of course their knee jerk response;  he is not a real muslim, that terrorists are not true muslims. Well, he is as authentic muslim as it gets! Him and his minions follow the teachings of Mohammed to a tee. ISIS might not be represent every muslim, I know many nice people who were assigned this faith at birth, but it sure represents Islam as a totalitarian political ideology. Everything they do, from the establishment of the Caliphate, to throwing gays off the highest building in the city, is supported by passages in their holy texts. Do you even know what is in the Qur'an? Do you have any idea how these people feel about the West? Do you think they want to come here and cannot wait to adopt our culture and assimilate? If so, you are gravely mistaken! I've lived in the UK for more that 10 years and I can see how the 'assimilation' and the 'wonderful multicultural diversity' had worked out for them.

&gt; Meanwhile India couldn't even begin border talks with a friendly neighbor like Bangladesh until recently.

India fucked up this issue badly with Bangladesh. There is no other way to say it.

&gt; And they are extremely generous! Only twice has China ever taken more than 50% of their original territorial claim.

 Besides India, China has [fought with Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War). Some of Chinese claims go back about 200 - 300 years or so, especially the ones with Tajikistan and Nepal. Tajikistan resolved the border dispute by [ceding land to China](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567), as did Pakistan. There are many countries who will refuse to do that. 

China considers the claimed territories to conceded as result of ""unequal treaties"" that they signed with Tsarist regimes, European and American powers. It refuses to acknowledge their validity, and insists that boundaries be renegotiated. If you were to apply that logic everywhere, Durand line would have to be renegotiated because the treaty was signed between the Afghani emir and the British, none of whom are around in South Asia. Pakistan asserts the validity of the Durand line even though it was the British who formalized the border, and not the Pakistanis. By the similar logic, Mexico should have a claim over Texas, even though it was annexed by United States way back in 1845, and Cuba should have a claim over Gitmo.

Indian dispute with China stems from the Chinese refusal to acknowledge the validity of McMahon line, which China states is no longer valid, as it was signed between the British and the Tibetians. Most countries, except China honour the international treaties signed by territories they acquire or control. This case by case refusal by China to acknowledge internationally signed treaties, and it's adamancy in asserting claims that are more than a century old, defies belief.",t5_2qh89

&gt;No, seriamente, il sistema stupido non esiste, altrimenti non starebbe al potere.

Veramente è già successo. L'Unione Sovietica aveva una politica economica completamente sballata per almeno 70 anni e non solo è stata in piedi, ma ha vinto anche una guerra difficilissima e durissima. Se un sistema è sballato non è detto che non possa stare in piedi per lungo tempo.

Tu scherzi, ma parlando in giro l'idea di essere costantemente monitorati e schedati non è così stramba. Ne ho parlato recentemente con due/tre persone, di cui uno di destra e due di sinistra/estrema sinistra e l'idea di essere monitorati era piuttosto pervasiva.

There is estimated to be around [120 million tons of salt in the ocean](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/whysalty.html). According to that source, if we dumped the salt evenly over the surface of the earths landmass the salt pile would be around 150m high.

The surface of the earth is about [148 million km^2](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml), and Mongolias surface area is only [around 1.5 million km^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia). With Mongolia taking up only 1.01% of the surface area of the Earths landmass, if the sand were spread evenly over the area, it would be around 14800m high the entire way across, *just* enough to get out of the Troposphere (I'm not going to bother dealing with it being placed into the area the size of one of Mongolias cities, give XKCD What If *some work* when they cover the question). Naturally all life in the area is instantly crushed under the insane weight of the salt above them, along with most/all of the infrastructure of the country.

But salt won't stay a straight cliff-face on the borders of Mongolia.

Pretty much instantly after the salt is transported there, it will start to topple like an avalanche, swallowing most if not all of the countries of the Asian continent, spilling out onto Africa and Europe (potentially swallowing those too, remember, all of the earths landmass would be covered in 150m high walls of salt if spread evenly). The wave of salt would push into the oceans, causing massive waves to rock the west coast of America and any South-East Asian/Oceanian countries not yet covered in salt, and then the east coast would be rocked when the salt reached an ocean on the other side of the Afro-Eurasian landmass.

In the end, the salt would slowly reincorporate into the oceans through the water cycle, but animal life would probably have been wiped out within hours of the salt transfer taking place.

While Brexit might boost support for independence, I genuinely don't think the SNP want Brexit to happen - it opens up a whole new set of problems and parameters.

My personal opinion is that the polls will likely shift in favour of independence in the next 20 years as those who are currently in the 65+ bracket die. 

While I think people are likely to become more pro-union as they age (for reasons of conservatism and stability), I don't think that'll happen at a rate that'll compensate for losing the pro-union views of the elderly population who remember the post-war ""good old days"" of the UK.

Given that a shift in the views of only 5% of the population is what the independence movement requires, I think it's inevitable we'll see it happen gradually.

The biggest risk facing the independence movement is a resurgent Labour in the UK that supports federalism, or people feeling that an SNP-run Scottish Government has stagnated.

Say you have a batter A who is great against right-handed pitchers but sucks against left-handers, and another batter B who is great against left-handed pitchers and sucks against righties. If their positions are compatible (sometimes other players can shift around so it works) they can form a ""platoon""; A will start against righty starting pitchers and B will start against lefties, and if the opponent brings in a lefty relief pitcher against A, B can be brought in to pinch-hit and vice versa.

A or B *alone* are limited batters, but a platoon of the two will bring results over the course of the season that are comparable to an equally-handed, much more expensive elite batter. But you can't put a platoon in every position, because there are only so many spots on the active roster to go around.

So, when a batter bats against his favored-handed pitcher, he has the ""platoon advantage""; even if he does really well while having the platoon advantage, that alone won't make him a ""complete"" batter - if he doesn't get decent results against the other pitchers, teams can really only make full use of him as a pinch hitter (a substitute) or, as mentioned, if they have another batter who can form the other side of the platoon.",t5_2qm7u

First of all to answer your question, I think this help will help you very much, please read all the answers , It's really a good read !!
https://www.quora.com/According-to-Islam-will-non-Muslims-ever-go-to-heaven

And secondly for your link, How to say for any ""errors"" found in Qu'ran people often forget that Qu'ran was written in arabic , and some things are sometimes left in the translations. If I just take an example here, when it says that bees feed on fruit,(in the website) in Arabic the context is understood and if you read it you will not find any contradications and it applies for many contradictions found in that link 
beside this website seems to try so hard to find errors, even if it can be easily refuted.

okay , so let's see about the topics that might be brought to you up in the future for contreversial parts in Islam .

1. Slavery in Islam : Slavery existed before Islam and people used to get War slaves after wining wars, In Qur'an which if you read passages of it, there might be verses concerning this , but it was usually in the *past form* , which meant , that for those who had slaves are not to be taken away from them, BUT, there isn't any verse that speaks of Slave in the present or future form, which means that Islam it self didn't allow people to have slaves after Islam, it's not only that, Islam actually pushed people to release their slaves as a form of atonement of sin.

2. Sex with childreen: The marriage of Muhammed to Aisha:

 I quote "" 1400 years ago it was something very common to marry young girls, in fact they were not considered young girls, and rather they were considered young women back then. It is a historic fact that girls from the ages of 9 to 14 were being married in Europe, Asia, and Africa, in fact even in the United States girls at the age of 10 were also being married just more than a century ago.  ""

""”Child brides, whether Byzantines or foreign princesses, were the norm rather than the exception, especially from the late twelfth century”""

""People used to have very short life-spans in Arabia.. So it was only normal and natural at THAT timefor girls to be married off at ages 9 or 10 or similar.""

""It ought also be noted that Sayyidah Aisha (RA) was engaged to Jubayr son of Mut'im before Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him. This indicates the age of marriage and engagement in Prophet's time. However, the engagement was later nullified by Jubayr’s parents due to Abu Bakr (RA) embracing Islam.

""Another striking thing to observe is that among hundreds of her narrations there is not even a single one showing Aisha displeasure about this marriage. Hence, she had no problem with this relation. Infect it is manifest from several traditions that she loved the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him) too much and even felt some sort of jealousy when she found others around him. Does this not prove that she was extremely happy about this marriage?""

""It is important to know that girls during the* Biblical* and Islamic days used to be married off at young ages when they either had their first periods,.""

3.Rape in Islam : just to make this clear, if there's anything that seems criminal or unlogical just thinking about it, it's most likely forbidden in Islam. 

4. the Haddith saying that Men are to be expecting 42( or god knows what number) in Heaven, is false , I don't know where people found that .


Is there any points left ? If there are any, please let me know, and I'll do my best to answer.

O problema é dizer que foi eleitoreiro só por ser menor no outro governo, isso não faz sentido lógico.  Seriam todos os programas pequenos eleitoreiros? Poderíamos dizer que hoje em dia temos mais estudantes na escola logo nós governos anteriores a educação era tratada de forma eleiroreira? 

Vamos dar outro exemplo, o governo criou o vale cultura, mas ele atinge um número pequeno de pessoas comparado a população total, podríamos dizer que ele também é eleitoreiro? A partir de quantas pessoas atingidas ele deixa de ser eleitoreiro?

Everytime Japan is mentioned on reddit

&gt; There will be one or two people who show up and say that Japan has apologized for their actions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Japan has paid. Japan is making an effort to teach ww2 history. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it's true. The Japanese today are not the Japanese that did all those terrible things in the 1930s and 40s. It's true that the generation who committed all the atrocities is dying out. But so are their victims. 
&gt; 
&gt; My grandfather is long dead. He became an alcoholic after the war and passed in the 70s. Who knows whether it was related to the fact that the Japanese pumped his stomach up with water and jumped on his body because they could. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or maybe it was the way they rounded up all young Chinese males and executed them arbitrarily on the beaches of Changi. Maybe it was the rapes. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Japanese put Europeans in concentration camps and worked them to death? Cool. That's more than what Nanking got as well. Who knows if the ""comfort women"" were treated better. Is a life of a sex slave better than rotting away in unsanitary conditions? I don't know. I don't want to fucking know. 
&gt; 
&gt; All I know is this. Japanese war criminals are interned in the Yasukuni Shrine, and as long as the Shrine exists and continues to be visited by top politicians, sent offerings every year, the Japanese Government continues to disrespect everyone who suffered under their heinous crimes. I don't fucking care that there are other victims there, maybe even of previous wars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine the outcry if there was a German War cemetery with Goebbels, Himmler and Adolf himself interned alongside centuries of Prussian generals. 
&gt; 
&gt; So no. 
&gt; 
&gt; You're not fucking sorry Japan, and there's no defending your shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; P.s. Abe sent offerings to the shrine this month. This isn't ancient history. 
&gt; 
&gt; Edit: Just look at the comments right here it's disgusting. You wouldn't tell a Jew to get over the Holocaust, I dont understand how people can say things like this.

I've played all the games except 1, 3, 14 (lol Europe) and the original BS Akaneia Saga (also I have yet to try any of the Kaga Saga).

I *understand* the annoyance when you know people who're so against the idea of playing the older games.

I *understand* the annoyance with the waifu/husbando mentality so many new fans are coming into this fandom with.

I *understand* the annoyance that comes with seeing waves upon waves of people acknowledge only the newest games and forget that this series has been around since 1990. Heck, the main reason I migrated to Reddit for Fire Emblem media/discussions was because Tumblr's Fire Emblem tag was overbloated with posts regarding only Awakening and Fates... and sometimes Smash Bros.

And yet... is it worth getting this angry over? Don't get me wrong, while you're allowed to feel this way and vent about your frustrations about these things, demonising people with an opposite opinion to yours is not going to win you any favours. I think the best course of action is instead to try and approach them from a different angle.

If you want people to try the older games, slowly work towards convincing them. I have a friend who's been working his way through the Tellius games for the first time and he is loving the experience, along with discovering new favourite characters. And I'm having a blast seeing his reactions to everything. And this happened because I slowly convinced him to play the older games (though he's still yet to finish FE7 and FE11). Naturally, there are people who won't play the older games out of principle or fear of no Casual mode. If you fail to convince them, just let them be... You'll do you, and they'll do them.

In terms of people calling the characters their ""waifu""/""husbando""... So? Let them live their way. If they enjoy a game/character a certain way, let them do so.

Some of my favorite parks are: Yosemite, Sequoia, ZION, Bryce and the Great Smoky Mts.  If you visit the Smokies I would recommend staying in Gatlinburg.  It would give you a nice nightlife right next to your hotel. 

A couple of comments on your route.  It looks like you are planning extensive time on secondary roads in California and Colorado.  You may find these roads much slower than you want. Why are you going to Huston, TX?  I have never been, but my husband has and he did not care for it.  He found it to be very industrial. Your route in the Ohio area is odd.  If I was you after crossing back into the US at Niagara.  I assume you are stopping at the falls.  I would go to the Adirondacks or the Finger Lake region of NY and not to Ohio.

Overall I think you will have a good trip.  My advice is to pay attention to your drive times.  I have found my European relatives under estimate how big the US is and how long it will take to go from point A to B. Remember you are traveling a long way and you will spend a lot of time in the car.

It is all folly, madness, a crime against civilization! **You people speak so lightly of war; you don't know what you're talking about.** War is a terrible thing! You mistake, too, the people of the North. **They are a peaceable people but an earnest people, and they will fight, too.** They are not going to let this country be destroyed without a mighty effort to save it … Besides, where are your men and appliances of war to contend against them? **The North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make.** You are rushing into war with one of **the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical, and determined people on Earth — right at your doors.** You are bound to fail. Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. **If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.**

As to the discrepancy--early modern and especially proto-industrial economics is off my tarmac.

No. 1.5 billion humans in name only. Just like the whole of Europe, USA and S. America are supposed to be Christians. This is deeply insulting to all the people in Moslem countries who are supposed to be Moslem but are actually atheists, or hate religion. And also ignores the millions of people who are Moslem in name only and really couldn't give a shit, except to avoid pork or celebrate Ramadan. Every day, religions go out of their way to fight among themselves, Shiites vs Sunnis, weed out the unbelievers, the Sufis, the heretics, the people who don't really practice or who drink or eat pork or cheat on their wives. But the moment statistics come up, suddenly 1.5 billion people are Moslem (or Christian, or whatever). How convenient. Also, children don't even get a say in the matter.

If a religion is true, God doesn't need to show off about numbers to make it convincing. That is exactly what you do when you *are* insecure though. That's what cults and dictators and crappy marketing campaigns do. If Islam is true, then even if only *one* person in the world followed it, it would still be true. The fact people have to resort to distorting statistics and giving false information shows its weakness. 

&gt;giving up is not a bad thing .

There are a few things which will make it possible for you to do that.

- There are regions in the provinces where no one lives. You can just settle there and not be noticed. Why you'd want that though...that's a terrible life.

- There is no winter here and you don't ever have to concern yourself with getting cold.

You don't need to know how to build snares (there aren't any large animals anyway), you need to know how to grow crops and how to throw out nets.

Maybe learn how to dive and find out how you can send exotic fish to Europe and the US. In fact, you have to create connections with exotic animal dealers and shipping services. Then just pay someone locally to dive for the specific fish. I wouldn't recommend any other illegal activity to get some hands on money. No drug dealing/growing. ",t5_2qh7j

&gt; Until 1932, abortion was banned in Poland without exceptions. In that year, the new Penal Code legalized abortion only when there were medical reasons and, for the first time in Europe, when the pregnancy resulted from a criminal act. Except during the German occupation during the Second World War, this law was in effect from 1932 to 1956. In Nazi Germany, which included territories of Poland 1939-1945, the penalties for abortion were increased and in 1943, providing an abortion to an ""Aryan"" woman became a capital offense. Abortion was permitted if the foetus was deformed or disabled. In 1956 the Sejm legalized abortion in cases where the woman was experiencing ""difficult living conditions"". The interpretation of the change in the law varied from a restrictive interpretation, in the late 1950s, to one in where abortion was allowed on request, in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not uncommon that women from countries where abortions were restricted, such as Sweden, travelled to Poland to carry out abortions which were accessible and affordable there.

&gt; After the fall of Communism, the government banned abortion except in cases where abortion was the only way to save the life of the pregnant woman. In 1997, Parliament enacted a modification to the abortion bill, which permitted the termination of pregnancy in cases of emotional or social distress, but this law was deemed unconstitutional by the Polish Constitutional Court. In December of that year, the legal status of abortion in Poland was restored to that in 1993.",t5_2qh4j

Moreover, neo-energetics has not been confined to obscurity, but has always enjoyed a certain visibility within the scientific community. It has encompassed in its rank Nobel Laureates and holders of chairs at major research institutions. More significantly, the tradition has maintained itself for well over a century, but curiously enough, it has also remained congenitally peripatetic, never remaining within the boundaries of any particular academic discipline for more than a generation. It has displayed a tenacity that has proven capable of fending off empirical and theoretical criticisms with aplomb and therefore may shed some light on the similar tenacity and durability of neoclassical economic theory.
&gt;
&gt; The postulation of an identity between energy and economic value began as an offshoot of the energetics movement, discussed in my book *More Heat Than Light* [Mirowski 1988]. By the 1880s, the physicist Georg Helm and the physical chemist and Nobel Laureate Wilhelm Ostwald were claiming that the program of energetics intended to unite all of the sciences under a small set of principles and concepts, and “all” clearly included the nascent social sciences. Researchers anxious to elevate the tone and status of social inquiry were quick to pick up the hint. Soon, all over Europe, aspirants were proclaiming that energy would render economics, biology, and physics all subsets of the same unified science.

This is a review/essay by Mirowski dealing more with not-so-illustrious proponents of the “energetics” movement, but he wrote also this very interesting book [More Heat than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics](https://books.google.com/books?id=rmVhZnHId-oC) about the emergence of the neo-classical school by the late nineteenth century under the spell of thermodynamics (the cutting-edge physics theory back then).

Another interesting book of his is [Machine Dreams: Economics Becomes a Cyborg Science](https://books.google.com/books?id=GkrYxL0QtpcC), where he discusses the influence of cybernetics upon economics by the mid-twentieth century. Particularly interesting, I think, is the substitution by the economists of their preferred metaphor of the market as a railroad network (i.e., the market as a transportation system that moves things and people from one place to another) by our contemporary tendency of describing the market as a information processor (i.e., the market as a big computer much more capable of solving problems than our feeble human minds, so that we must defer to the market, let the market decide).",t5_2swgc

I've never before heard this idea that William the Conqueror ""brought feudalism to England."" 

Life for the 7th century Saxon serf wasn't all too different to the late 11th century Norman English peasant, but the main difference once William the Conqueror invaded was that the feudal system gradually become more pronounced and organised, with economic practice becoming more manorial. When the Normans invaded in 1066, England had only been a united kingdom for little over a hundred years (before then it was divided into seven kingdoms), so essentially the country's economic structure became more organised under the Normans' administration. England began to adopt the Frankish tradition of knighthood. Reciprocal ties between monarchs, lords, knights, and serfs were more established, but the whole idea of medieval feudal system being a clear-cut division of power between these groups is a bit of an oversimplified myth. It's worth noting that the definition of 'feudalism' itself is a controversial topic among historians, with a lot of debate over its real economic and political definitions.",t5_2ssp3

Thing is, the quality of the recent tw titles droped so considerably, i never thought i'd live to see the day of having zero, a zippy hype about the next total war game. It doesn't matter what time period they will pick if the game will be bad, and there are zero reasons to expect it to be good at this point. Every Rome II era game was a dissappointment, every single one of them, including dlc's. None of them is even remotly on par with the previous installments.

CA is one step away from becoming european Konami, being as oblivious to what people say about their games as the japanese, cause your pocket is the only opinion that matters. No wonder they end up making a non-history themed total war.

I still can't figure out what was the reason behind these insane values for unit stats. Like melee attack 56, melee defence 29, really, why 29? Why not 30? Just where does that number comes from anyway? Why do players had to deal with stats like weapon damage, and especially when it's so ridicously high, like 62 or something. How does any of these numbers make any sense. Health stat? Jesus. Nothing screams more ""i don't know"" than big numbers. Where is the simplicity that made people fall in love with total wars? 

The regions system ends up being dull and boring, it's just a big settlement anyway, which - and this is the funniest part - is best when when you just don't upgrade it. The AI is still on the level of ""accept or we will attack - please do not attack"". Man, i can talk for hours about the nonsense in these games. Like if CA themselves are trying to make this deal work, cause i have no idea what they are trying to do, or what direction the series are going, it's just bad games. And bad games are not a direction.

Like most in America, I've been indoctrinated into mainstream science through quantum physics/relativity school of thought. The interesting part of science is that many use current popular theories as assumptions for explaining things, whereas I always believed the purpose of science was to tackle and question these assumptions in order to progress our understanding of the universe. This current trend of science disallows more creative ideas and models of our universe from further research without buying into our academic institutions, which in my opinion nowadays are plagued with politics and less concerned with actual progress of knowledge.

From my own personal research through occult knowledge, history, modern physics, and recent technological developments, my intuition has led me to believe that almost any proposed model of the universe can be jammed into a mathematical model if you force the numbers into preconceived observations and believe-able heuristics, yet we don't complain if it doesn't explain everything (e.g. general relativity unable to reconcile with quantum physics) unless the general mainstream supports it. We could say that academics is the filter which we can examine the validity of such theories, but often, it is a agenda-filled circle jerk and self fulfilling prophecies with popular ideas overshadowing less known (and subjectively less credible) new models of our universe. Anything that does not fit the current model of science is considered ""psuedo-science"" which is even more harmful to advancement since pretty much any new developments that challenge that status-quo is automatically labeled that.

I've studied many newer models of proposed ""theories of everything"" that aren't talked about in mainstream science from electric universe to holofractals:
https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/

A common element I find is an emphasis on restructuring our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and the usage of fractal geometry. After some digging, torsion physics, a lesser known theory from the 1980's, includes many of these elements found in both theories while stemming from general relativity itself. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_field_(pseudoscience)

I look to Tesla for a lot of answers when it comes to examining science as well, as I feel like a lot was omitted from his work. Something i'd like to research a bit more is a theory that Einstein actually plagiarized his work from someone else which suggests that there MAY have been a larger agenda to push specific schools of science: http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_einstein.htm

Alas, I am pretty busy trying to survive to truly dedicate myself to physics right now, but hopefully you can help connect some dots.

edit: P.S. You're definitely on the right track with superconductors and plasma physics. Was staggered to learn a few months ago how many different states of matter exist (12+ if i recall?). Quantum computing requires superconductors and a deep understanding of particle spin, and it seems as if we're coming close to ""true"" quantum computing. torsion physics can explain that.

In response to a point about free movement discriminating against non-EU migrants, she says this is a narrative which raises expectations that you can 'clear the streets of anyone *foreign-looking*'. There was no reason to bring race into the argument; nobody else had -the point being made was that current immigration policy discriminated *against* non-Europeans. This is an attempt to associate any criticism of immigration policy, no matter what the angle, with racial bigotry.

 &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtKPw1pNO44#t=63

Here she talks about Teresa May's 'tough' talk on immigration, and says to the only other ethnic minority on the panel Nish Kumar 'they can't stop us because we're already here'. She's not even an immigrant herself. Nor is Kumar as far as I know. She deliberately conflates (alleged) opposition to mass immigration to not wanting non-white people in the country.

 &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4EIC1-es_8

She explicitly calls Nigel Farage's comments about Romanian immigration racist.

 &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucHhgpRZcZg

She compares opposition to immigration levels (in 2013) to Germany in the 1930s and says that 'immigrant in British politics has actually *always been a euphemism for race*'.

 &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJF15kNazlw

In response to a point about the integration of migrants, she says 'as for the talk of how we *non-white Britons* have to adapt to British culture...'. The person making the point has said specifically that colour didn't matter and needn't even be discussed.

 &gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhvOSoSlRfo#t=60

This was during a Q&amp;A session when she was campaigning to be Mayor of London. Someone who had lived in Canada for a number of years and had had to pay a basic subscription to use their health service asked if she thought a similar policy ought to be implemented in the UK. Her response started with 'It may seem like a good idea to you to stop immigrants or people who might *look like immigrants* using the NHS without paying.' Again, race was not a part of the question and she accused the questioner of being motivated by racism.",t5_2qhcv

I quit my job after working +2 years with my previous engineer job (I was 24).  I quit similar reasons.

I bought one way ticket to Berlin and see where it takes me. I ended up traveling Eastern Europe, all the way through the Balkans and Turkey and traveled more in Spain and Morocco for 6+ months.

Easily one of the best decisions I ever made. Made wonderful memories with people and places that I would never imagined that I will end up in. The great thing about solo traveling is the total freedom. Plus you deal many situations that you would normally don't have to face back home so it's definitely an experience and self-discovery (at least to me).

Was I reluctant to quit my job? Hell yeah. It would be mean I would lose that sense of security (financial stability, health benefits,etc). But after giving more thoughts, it would a total waste of opportunity not to do this and start something new, especially for a job that I despised.

One of the biggest things I've learned after I came back is that, as cliche as it sounds, life is  truly short. Seize the opportunity if you can. You might end up going back home early but at least you've made your own choice to get out of there, which many people may regret when it's too late to take that chance anymore.

Currently I will be starting school to start programming with a positive outlook in life :)

The same goes for areas where private companies will not invest because the profit is uncertain. And yes, obviously, when the government needs to get something done, they can ask private companies for offers. The problem is when EU decides (and yeah, I know we are the EU as well and we have representatives in the Brussels, the point was that  officials in Brussels no matter their nationality don't always make smarter decisions on how to spent money than the free market would) that Europeans would be more healthy if they did more sports (just a made-up example). So suddenly Czech ministry for local development gets a lot of money, but since the bureaucracy is slow and some of the local officials might be new or incompetent, everything gets delayed and we end up with a situation where we have to spend a lot of money very quickly otherwise we might lose them. And that wouldn't be good, since people don't like to hear it when politicians fail to use the money we got. So, hurry up, we have to spend, spend, spend, so what do we do? Well how about new routes for cyclists, there is no time to think of anything else and if we only do one big project then we will only have to make one tender. So suddenly we are building cycling routes like crazy, we build more of them than we actually need and we quickly move to another last-minute spending.

I've made this example up, but I have one personal experience with EU funds and it worked pretty much like this - no one cared to evaluate what benefits it will actually bring, the only goal was to get rid of the money quickly before the deadline passes, so that we can say that we spend the EU money. This kinda left me with a feeling that the money could be used much better. I don't know how widespread this wasting of money is, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was not that uncommon.",t5_2qh4j

Most Armenians grew up to be or were raised atheists during the Soviet period as Communism required state atheism. Some exceptions were made because of Armenia's religious history, but in all reality, they were culturally Christian, rather than devotedly highly religious and all that. In fact, the increase in religiousness occurred falling the collapse of the Soviet Union, as a means of supporting nationalism and reconnecting with old heritage. The same was seen in Russia. 

As for case studies, take the most famous national poet and lovable rogue, Yeghishe Charents, whose face appears on Armenian currency. Charents was a closeted bisexual who wrote erotic homosexual poems that he hid from the general public. This is despite him living and writing during the Stalin period, where Soviet repression and the removal of all things religious in nature was at its highest. He wouldn't dare publish these poems, and by this one can assume the Soviet repression of homosexuality was no different from what we see in the largely religious Armenia today. Only recently have these poems been published much to the chagrin and protest of the Armenian government. 

Armenia is in a tough position... as history shows us, Western Armenian culture was highly influenced by Europe. We see anti-clerical writings, newspapers, promotion of secularism, embracing human rights and modernity, in the large portion of the Armenian writers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Had there not been a genocide, and had all these writers and cultural leaders not been arrested and killed, Armenian culture today, in Armenia, would be radically different. So enlightenment and humanism did not skip Armenia... it just was uprooted just as it was beginning to blossom. 

One cannot assume most of the people would be willing to commit acts of violence like that, let alone, a genocide of all things against gay people. No one is getting beheaded in Armenia or whipped for violating a holy book. Disownment from families, I'd certainly expect, but not murder. Such stories like the one you mentioned are not pretty, it's good you brought them up, but are isolated instances. And I'm not trying to romanticize anything... I'm just stating things how I see it. 

Also, homophobia is not necessarily religious in nature. Lebanon is very religious, yet it is in a better position than China, which has a very anti-religious state. Yes homophobia correlates with religiousness on average, but there are always exceptions to the rule- the outliers. Take Azerbaijan, which is similarly religious in identity, but not in actuality.",t5_2tk95

It is all very hazy, after 15 years and I am quite sure I was drugged but here is what I remember from 2001 - the speech is probably not completely accurate:

On 27th July on my way back from work in Telford after an early finish on a friday I decided to take a different route home to avoid the roadworks on the M54 motorway.  Along the way, I don't recall exactly where, I found a confused average looking man in his 40s walking in the English summer heat along the country road.  He said his name was Andre or Andreas spoke to me in broken english in what I think was an east european accent and asked me to take him to a village that turned out to be 60 miles away on the other side of birmingham in worcestershire - I was never able to remember the name. He begged for me to help but insisted he would pay me on arrival.  He seemed very desperate and weak, but quite well dressed, if a little untidy and I thought unlikely to cause me harm (I was 22 and still quite naive).  I tried to ask him if he wanted to go to hospital but he insisted I take him as quickly as possible to a particular address. I gave him water but he refused to eat anything and drifted in and out of sleep most of the way. It took just over an hour to drive to the nearest town (Stourport on Severn) then he directed me to the village and a street and a house on its own, and invited me in - still very confused.  Once inside I was greeted by a commotion in the next room and then a ""man"" with a balaclava entered and greeted me also with an east european accent.  Ok so I thought I had walked in to some kind of robbery gang and I was going to be seriously harmed but he spoke very calmly and asked how much money I needed and if I would like a drink or to use the bathroom.  Andreas had disappeared but I said i'm not worried about the money - but that he should see a doctor or something.  He told me not to worry - that he would be taken care of - its just the heat and he will be ok.  ""Will a hundred be enough?""  £100 was a lot of money to me back then, the jouney in my 1 litre Nissan Micra didnt cost anything like that and I always felt bad being paid more than it cost me when I did something for someone. I said £20 will be fine.  ""But you have to drive back, your time, you might have saved Andreas' life, please take it.""  I didnt want to offend a man in a balaclava, I was starting to wonder if Its a trick though, if these are some kind of criminals are they just going to hand me a cash and let me go?  I had seen movies enough to know that's not how it goes so my mind is really beginning to race - I am in the middle of knowhere , nobody knows I am here, I have no connection to this place or these people - they could kill me and dispose of my car and nobody would ever find out.  Until now I am by the doorway on to the hall of a very sparsly decorated living room, the guy in the balaclava is kind of standing to block the view in to the dimly lit room behind.  If I am quick I can possibly get out of the door and in my car but I don't remember if the front door was locked behind me. I know my time is running out,  ""Are you going..."" I decide to go, i turn quickly to my right to head out of the door behind me, anticipating to turn right as I go in to the hall and go for the front door.  I am wearing dress shoes for work, my left foot doesnt grip the metal carpet threshold and I fall forward in to stairs ballustrade  and then nothing.  

I wake up in a bed at night my head, eyes and nose are aching, I feel thirsty and like I have the flu. I try to sit up but it hurts like the worst hangover so I slowly go back down.  I think I must be dreaming, I have had occasional lucid dreams like this so I decide its best to go back to sleep - I don't like pain.  What seems like a few hours later I wake again, more alert this time, I notice I'm still wearing my clothes as I can feel the stickiness.  There is no light except from outside - I can tell i am not in my own bed.  I'm trying to remember how I got here, I turn to look around, did I meet a woman or something - I dont do one night stands though - I can't remember how I got here. I try to remember going to work, what day is it?  Is it friday or saturday? Was work on friday just a dream?  Is this still a dream?  So I try to sit up again and it doesn't seem to hurt as bad as the last time.  As soon as a I sit up I notice I need to pee. I free my legs and begin to stand up. I dont know if I am dreamign but I didnt like the sensation or smell of peeing myself when I was 6 and I dont wish to repeat it.  I think I can see the outline of a door so I start to gingerly move toward it.   I kick my shoes as i edge along the bed.  I make it to the door and I'm relieved that is opens on to a lit landing, there are 6 doors on this landing but 1 is open, i hope its the bathroom or toilet, its a small bathroom, I find the pullstring and do my business.  I start thinking to myself, wherever i am, the people must have just moved in or are movnig out, there is nothign in the bathroom except the fixtures - also i didnt notice a mirror.

Should I try to wake someone?  Would that be rude?  I dont know where i am or what day it is - surely its not rude in that case.  But maybe they have to work in the morning.  I hate being woken in the middle of the night.  I decide I seem to be safe, so I guess I can find out in the morning.  What time is it anyway?  I never wear a watch because the sensation annoys me and I didnt have a mobile phone back then.  DOes it matter what time it is?  I'll just go back to bed.  I know I wont be able to sleep now though - my jaw will just be tense wondering about what the hell is going on and all sorts of scenarios will be running through my mind.  I flush and go back to ""my room"", leaving the bathroom light on so I can't move around a little more carefully.

Just as I am about to lie back down, ""You hit your head."" I almost jump out my skin. ""What?... who?""

""I'm sorry"", I couldnt  tell if it's a man or a woman, it's one of those voices.  ""Earlier today you had a little accident."" came a voice from the darkness.

""Oh...""  ""You tried to run and you slipped and hit your head.""   I try to visualise it: ""I don't remember"". ""its quite usual, not remembering."" 

""Where am I?  I don't know your voice?  Do I know you?""

""You don't know me, you are probably far away from home.  Where do you live?""

""Wolverhampton.""

""Ah, yes, quite a distance for you, don't worry you will be able to go home tomorrow.""

""What day is tomorrow?""

""Saturday, You did get quite a bang it seems.  You are in Worcestershire.  You are safe, your car is here.""

""How did I get to Worcestershire?  I have only ever driven through it."" 

""You helped my friend, Andreas.  You brought him home.  We are thankful to you.""

"" I don't remember...""  ""Don't worry""

""what's your name?""  

""Call me Santa...   I know it sounds funny - it's a Latvian name."" I still couldnt tell if it was a mana or a woman speaking from the dark corner.

""You will regain your memory of what has happened.  You will have lots of questions..  I am someone you might have read or heard about but much of it is lies.""

""Santa?, I only know santa claus"" 

""Yes, well no, he is not real... I am much older and I dont have any reindeer.  I do have have helpers, one of them is andreas.""

""Sorry but is there a light in here?""

""I can't let you see me.""

""Why not?""

""Because it would frighten you too much.  My appearance is not how you may think.  I don't look human."" 

""What?  Did something happen? Sorry, I shouldnt ask""

""No. it is ok.  I, we,  are not from here; although I sound like you I am not.  It is better if you do not know anything more.""

""Oh you are from Latvia?  I thought Latvia is in Europe?""

""Yes it is, we are not from Latvia though.  We are scientists but from far our home.  Farther than you can imagine.  We have been here for thousands of years conducting tests and observing.""

""Oh i see...  What?  Thousands of years?""

""Yes, I have been here over 7000 years.  Our first experiments are innacurately recorded in your religions.  A side-effect we had not expected. I have said too much already, I rarely get chance to talk with your kind though.""

Next thing I remember its morning. and my memory is even more jumbled.  I get out of bed and put my shoes on and find the house is empty.  There is a note in what passes for a kitchen along with my keys.  "" Thanks for your help. Lock the door.  Go left to get home.""   I make my way to the front door I now have a vague memory of trying  to escape from.

I get in my car and touch my forehead which is sore, look in the mirror and there is a scar on my forehead like an old wound.   I'm also very hungry and thirsty.

I get home and my parents, grandmother and aunt are worried sick - I was still living with my parents.  I don't normally disappear without letting people know I'm not coming back.  They thought I had been killed or something.   I told them what happened as best I could but some details were blurry.  THey were just glad i was back home.

After a few days my memory begins to piece together.  Over the next few months I spent a huge amount of time travelling down to worcestershire trying to find the village I had been taken to.  I don't know why or what exactly I was going to do really but I never did find it.   After some time and reading I have come to my current  belief that the ""evil one"" in the bible is actually an alien.

*BRASÍLIA — A presidente Dilma Rousseff anunciará neste domingo, em evento do Dia do Trabalho em São Paulo, um aumento escalonado nos benefícios do Bolsa Família. Segundo auxiliares da presidente, o reajuste será feito por faixas. O maior percentual será de cerca de 5%. Dilma, que está reunida com o ministro da Fazenda, Nelson Barbosa, no Palácio da Alvorada, estuda ainda correção das faixas do Imposto de Renda. A decisão de aumentar o benefício ocorre após o secretário do Tesouro, Otavio Ladeira, afirmar que não há espaço fiscal no Orçamento para a medida.*
 

*Assessores da presidente reconhecem que o “dinheiro é curto”, mas que, apesar das restrições financeiras, Dilma optou por fazer um reajuste “significativo”. Segundo um auxiliar, a presidente tem ordenado aos ministros que reforcem marcas da área social do governo, dando a “sinalização devida de que não pode haver retrocessos”. Fontes do Planalto têm afirmado que Dilma não promoverá, com o aumento, um rombo nas contas públicas. O impacto dessa medida será de no máximo R$ 1 bilhão.*

Here I will link some studies discussing how people respond differently to nutritional interventions. The implication is that since people do not respond in a homogenous way, we should be careful about causally linking study population sample mean results to our own lives. Or linking our own experiences to how others will respond.

*Note: I will not be discussing or critiquing these papers due to time considerations*

###Vitamin D:

[Quraishi et al 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298726619_Low_vitamin_D_status_in_Europe_moving_from_evidence_to_sound_public_health_policies):

&gt; Polymorphisms in the DBP gene and in the vitamin D receptor likely have a strong influence on individual need for vitamin D and on the response to supplementation (9) 

&gt; randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation have yielded mixed results to date, suggesting that the association between “low” 25(OH)D concentrations and disease outcomes may not always be causal. 

Wang et al, [2010](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44666633_Wang_TJ_Zhang_F_Richards_JB_Kestenbaum_B_van_Meurs_JB_Berry_D_et_al_Common_genetic_determinants_of_vitamin_D_insufficiency_a_genome-wide_association_study_Lancet_2010_376_180-188): 

&gt; The genotype score was [...] associated with the risk of severe vitamin D deficiency

&gt; [...]

&gt; In conclusion, we report the results of the first large-scale, systematic investigation of genetic determinants of vitamin D insufficiency. Elucidating the genetic architecture of this trait provides a better understanding of the regulation of vitamin D metabolism. Additionally, the genetic variants described in this report identify individuals at substantially elevated risk for vitamin D insufficiency. 

Wang et al found a correlation between genetic genotypes and vitamin D deficiency risk. This agrees with the findings of Quraishi et al, 2016 that there are individual genetic differences modulating Vitamin D in the body. Implications of this is that different people may have different risk factors for deficiency. If true, this idea supports the notion of individualised micronutrition rather than population-based recommendations (“take a multivitamin, everything will be fine”).



###Insulin:

Zeevi et al found in [2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284246638_Personalized_Nutrition_by_Prediction_of_Glycemic_Responses) that people have different insulin responses to the same foods:

&gt; - High interpersonal variability in post-meal glucose observed in an 800-person cohort

&gt; - Using personal and microbiome features enables accurate glucose response prediction

&gt; - Prediction is accurate and superior to common practice in an independent cohort

&gt; - Short-term personalized dietary interventions successfully lower post-meal glucose 

&gt; (...)

&gt; Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryc5M3Ciytg) of it for those that do not feel like reading the entire paper. 

Again, we find some evidence suggesting people respond differently to the same dietary practices. This implies a dissociation between common dietary recommendations versus and individual-centric focus. This ties back into the causality of observations between group means and individual responses. In practice this means that what you read about how study sample populations react to various treatments, may not have a 1:1 carry-over to you as an individual

**Here are some other interesting sources on individual factors:**

------------------------------

#Practical applications: so how does this affect my life?

There are several ways this could have a direct impact on your life. Perhaps the most obvious difference is what you consider to be evidence of causation. I've witnessed many discussions on various forums that seem to end once a person brings up a study. Rarely are methods discussed, or limitations considered. One study is never enough to prove causality. Often times when we look at the research literature in a given field, we find that there's a lot of disagreement and contradictory findings. Things are rarely clear cut with pure consensus.

Beyond this, we may also observe anecdotal evidence. It's usually highly upvoted if it is given by a popular authoritative figure. I'm not saying to disqualify advice from competent coaches, but if we are to be strict about what is causal, we can't take somebody's word for it without questioning its validity. The same thing goes for big bodybuilders giving advice about exercise programming. It could be that their size means they have a lot of knowledge about this, and we should listen to them. Or, it could be that confounding factors such as amazing genetics, or steroids explain their size, rather than their knowledge about exercise. So assuming someone is right because they have an amazing body is not necessarily a correct assumption to make. Furthermore, if an average person is to follow the advice of a pro bodybuilder, it is not given that he will experience the same mass increases. Again, because of numerous confounding factors. 

So what's the solution? In my opinion there isn't an objective foolproof solution to how we determine what to do in regards to our diet and exercise. I think the answer lies in experimentation, combined with an awareness of the research. For some people, keto might work, for others, low fat will make them feel great. In regards to RT, some gym goers will find success with high rep bodybuilding style work, while others prefer powerlifting. Trying to say there's only one correct scientific (or unscientific) way to do things in regards to fitness and nutrition is highly reductionistic, and completely ignores all the confounding variables of the world we live in, as well as the individualised nature of human beings (genetics, previous trauma or injury, diseases or illnesses, lifestyle factors, etc.++). I will go as far as to say I look up to coaches, gurus, or authors who say there is not only one method or right way ^tm of doing things (i.e. the relatively unknown [Tom Purvis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL5GFU7qKRBy6HH2_8HHnQ/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid) has a lot of good videos on Youtube).

With that said, I do think there are some variables under our control that we should manipulate for improved overall fitness, like getting proper sleep, being aware of whether you're in a caloric surplus or deficit, protein intake, exercise program &amp; periodisation, overall diet quality, awareness of diseases or conditions that might interfere with progress, and so on. The absurdity starts when we try to pick all these things apart and try to make causal claims about things in isolation like whether a certain macronutrient will harm us, or whether a certain exercise is “the best” for strength, or whether a certain supplement is good for everyone because it makes you feel better. You might react to these examples, but ask yourself this; have you controlled your N=1 experiment? How do you know it is not placebo? Anecdotal experiences are very useful for the individual but they shouldn't be the basis of advice, in my opinion. Or if it is given as advice it should be framed properly (in a humble way, recognising the limited nature of anecdotes). I know this sounds like I'm trying to kill off discussion, but that is not my intention at all. I'm just trying to apply some perspective to our thinking and reasoning. 

I'll admit that I fall into these thinking traps from time to time, as the feeling of not knowing can be quite vexing when you're trying to solve a problem. However, I think replacing doubt with strong opinions is not the way to go. In fact, there are so many things we don't know about exercise and nutrition, so many things that are hotly debated and uncertain. The only logical thing to do is to accept it for what it is: uncertainty that might be alleviated in the future as our knowledge base grows. So in my opinion, the best we can do at the moment is the following:

- Be aware of the existing conflicting research as well as its limitations

- Experiment with ourselves to try to figure out how our unique bodies respond to exercise

- Trying not to take ""common truths"" to be irrefutably causal

- Not assuming what works for you will work for others, and what works for others will work for you

Please let me know what you think in the comments :) I would love to get some discussion going on this since I've touched on a lot of hot subjects. I also want to add that some of the (non-referenced) information presented here is my opinion, which means that it is fallible and I don't claim that this is The Only Truth^tm. I'd like to hear other perspectives on this.

This article is very suspicious - a very sensationalized article from the Independent, known for its leftist bias - often much stronger than the traditionally leftist the guardian. 

Anyone here can point to **actual data** on how AirB'n'B raises rent for all apartments in Berlin? Germany has a very large and very robust renting market - very much unlike in Britain or the US and the prices are much lower, especially in the east. This would have to be a very serious increase in rent to threaten ""affordable housing"" in a country that is ""affordable"" compared to any other western European country. Berlin is a huge 4+ million city with very affordable housing prices for a capital city. How is that possible that all those apartments suddenly compete for tourists coming to Berlin? Because that is what would be necessary for a significant increase in rent cost.

There are also two important considerations:

How banning AirBnB will affect the incomes of people who were using it - just how many of them were rich people getting filthy rich and how many people earning on the side.

How are the rent prices affected by other factors - inflation, changes in credit availability on the financial markets, changes in Euro exchange rate, demographic changes etc etc.

Because so far I suspect a typical dishonest move by hotel industry which is the most threatened by the likes of AirB'n'B because unlike the housing base for a four million city there are a scarce number of hotels, and even fewer of them charge prices which can compete with AirBnB prices.So the standard play - throughout history - is to scream at the top of the lungs that you are doing something for the people and then do something that packs your pockets even more.  

Similar stories have been happening with Uber only here it's tough to really play the champion of the people when the taxi firms are shafting the same customer base. With AirBnB it is the people who are supposed to benefit (and I bet they will! politicians promise!) while the toursists are going to get shafted - thanks to AirBnB they paid lower prices, now they will be screwed by hotels once again.

Also Berlin is - IIRC - run by a leftist coalition, the mayor is from SPD so it's predictable that they would do something like that.

**Check when the elections in Berlin are happening**. It might be a move to both satisfy the hotel industry (donations!) and the populace to steer them away from radical parties like AfD, Linke etc which are very strong in former East Germany in general.",t5_2qh3l

It was an awesome time. made bunch of friends and we formed a guild. But that server died as the rest back then and we remained almost the only one on the IMP side doing anything. people kept playing only because of the guild...but that didn't hold for long. server transfers were only a dream back then so some decided to roll our toons again to TOFN and start over. we felt the game alive again and it was great. 
we even made a video to convince our friends how great is TOFN and to encourage them to re-roll and not quit the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZBHu9BJ0KU
watch the ending and see how we felt like kids back then. lol.

Then came the merges and we got our old toons to join us on TOFN again. back then TOFN was the ultimate PVP server for europe and everyone just moved there. the game was amazing again for us. 

This was the time i met my future wife in the game. we were playing in the same guild but in different countries. we were raid mates and we finally got married and now have a boy - Lucas. 
Watch this video from Ilum on TOFN back then: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FhTD3qb2Eg
Where was the last time Ilum had any PVP anywhere? 


And this is why its so hard for me to move from TOFN - it used to be everything i wanted in the game. It is the place i met my wife. The server i played for almost 4 years. But now its only a ghost of its old glory. 
if the history from the first transfer teaches us anything is that server merges are coming. This is the same exact scenario it had back then. 

This Saturday morning i Logged TOFN and there was 12 people on IMP fleet. I waited 3 hours for a WZ. History repeats itself. I am now saying goodbye to TOFN and me &amp; wife are moving to RED ECLIPSE very soon. It's the same feeling we had when we moved countries and left our old home. 
Goodbye TOFN, you were glorious and marvelous but all things come to an end. You will be missed. Lets start our adventures again...

Hi guys! I'm a new DM setting up a D&amp;D 5e campaign through Roll20, and I need 3-4 players (Already have someone from my usual group). *Preferably newbies*, as I want to introduce new players to this amazing game. However, I will insist that you know the rules before the first session. It's alright if you're not 100% clear on them, that's something you can only really acquire by playing, but you *need* to have read through *at least* the rules sections of the Player's Handbook, as well as whatever class/race passages concern you. That way we can keep the gaming moving swiftly without getting bogged down by the rules.

We'll be using Roll20 to run the game, along with Skype voice chat, and possibly video as well. By the way, I'd suggest you create a Roll20 account and familiarize yourself with the basic functioning of the system, even if you don't get in the game. It's such an incredibly useful tool for playing any p&amp;p games online, and there's a bunch of tutorials you can use.

I'm UTC+2 (Western Europe), and looking to run Every Thursday around 8:30PM UTC+2. Make sure you know what time this is for your timezone! Also please don't apply if you're not absolutely sure you'll be able to make it every week reliably at this time.

We'll be playing a modified version of the Lost Mine of Phandelver module, and then branch out into something a bit more open-ended after we finish it. It's a great module for introducing new players to the game, but it is also quite combat heavy, and surprisingly difficult. If that doesn't sound like your thing, best avoid it. Also, I'm looking to run a fairly mature game. Never exceedingly graphic, but to be safe, I'd ask that you be 16+. There'll also be a few basic rules of conduct that everyone, myself included, will be expected to follow.

If you're interested, I'd just like to know your names, Skype usernames, availability (in case we need to shift a session), and what race/class you'd most like to play. If you're not sure what would fit you best, or what you'd like to play, I'll try my best to walk you through the character creation process before the game. Also, I'd like to know a few things about yourself, such as what you're looking for in this D&amp;D campaign, and anything else you'd like to share with me that might be relevant. If you don't feel confortable sharing any or some of these informations publicly, you can also PM me your application.

I know I may sound a bit negative here, but I'm just covering my bases. It's my DM instincts taking over. I hope to have a lot of fun during this campaign, and that everyone will enjoy it! 

**EDIT:** I've gotten quite a few answer! I'm too tired to make a rational decision right now, but I'll be contacting people tomorrow. You can still apply though.",t5_3bygj

No major studies in the US that I know of. Why not? Probably because until rather recently, it wasn't recognized as a major cause of genital herpes, and because unlike HSV-2, it hasn't been proven to increase the risk of HIV (though I imagine it could, if the infection is anogenital).

[This Australian study](http://www.jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/194/5/561.full) found that 54% of HIV-negative gay men under age 25 and 76% of 25- to 34-year-olds were infected. Seems high, but only a few of the participants came from clinics—most were recruited at gay social events and venues, via the press, online, etc. So it's probably a good representative sample. The paper also says this:

&gt;Elsewhere, the prevalence of HSV-1 in homosexual men has been reported to be 55%–77% in a small number of studies in Europe, the United States, and Japan.

I thought that it is common sense that you don't inherently get 'wiser' with age, but instead it is the experiences you have through your life that make you wiser. My mistake. ... ...

Age is a good rule of thumb, mostly because people hang around their own age groups, and get experiences with things at roughly the same time. But if someone has friends that are older (even an older sibling), they will get exposed to certain things faster. They will learn it before others. The main issue I take with is *which* age you have selected and why. I will ask this question once again in hopes that you might actually answer it in case you missed it: (I also would like to know what you thought about my examples about the sandwich - but that is less important)

&gt;If our society deemed 16 to be a fully grown adult, would you be making the argument that 16 is where most of the coercion could happen? Or would you stick to 18? Which, age, and why?

In other words, why did you chose 18 as the magic number to allow people to have sex? Why not 15? why not 21? People in America cannot buy alcohol until 21, why not make it consistent?


&gt; But, there's a point when you must consider the pros and cons of it

I see no pros in charging teenagers with rape and putting them on a sexual offender's list when they have sex with each other. It's like the war on drugs, but with sex. Having it illegal doesn't stop people from doing it, it just puts the people who do it (most) at a risk of being charged with a crime, which will do more damage than the act would have ever done. I would even go as far as to say that it makes the society worse.


Pros| Cons
---|---
Learning how to stay safe | Teenagers can talk about sex more freely
Lower fear of being prosecuted| Teens continue to have sex (Oh the horror! How will they cope!?)
Not a sexual offender if has sex | Teenagers could go against what their parents say and have sex (parent cannot use the 'I will call the police, and have him locked up' threat)
Ability to get help if something did happen(eg. rape) without being afraid of being prosecuted too | Less births overall
Less unsafe abortions | ?
Less teen pregnancies | ?
Less unwanted children | ?
Life not ruined as name doesn't pop up in the sexual offenders list | ?

Please feel free to also make a list of pros/cons, I have yet to hear one pro that is strictly related to the person's age.

&gt;You can subject everyone to a mental evaluation to determine if they're able to have sex, however that would be accomplished

You can also just allow everyone who hit puberty to have sex. Wow, so hard.

&gt;I admire your effort to question and challenge arbitrary laws and cut points in our society, and how, in the future, our 'ancient ways' will probably be sneered at and ridiculed

I've got to say... It already has. Europe is very open to sex. Teenagers have sex all the time, no one cares as everyone was taught how to be safe. Many, if not most countries have laws which allow at least teenagers to have sex with each other, (I believe in my country it was 13+ but the partner must be within a 3 yr age difference, unless they are &gt;17 - something like that). America, especially certain places in America are very prudish, and make you ashamed and afraid of sex. When a teenager can go on a sexual offender's list just because they had sex with someone or be charged with production of child porn when they take a photo of themselves nude, I say that country is batshit insane. I see no pros in a country which tells people when/who with people can have sex with.",t5_2qh1i

They will inevitably lose. They aren't behaving rationally. If they want to ruin their society, so be it. The intellectuals will cease supporting them so eventually their country will succumb to their own stupidity.

Other than Germany/France/UK, I see no other European country have any real power. 

The highly educated people simply don't support the idiots who vote for right wing extremism. How will these countries get anything done when all the smart people leave and take their money with them? Things automatically have to normalize.

Look at the polling results about the demographics of certain candidates. Recently there was a presidential election in my country (Austria) where the right wing extremist party gained a majority of the votes. But who actually voted for them? 45% of people without a highschool degree, but only 14% of people with at least a high school degree (numbers will almost certainly be even lower for people with a university degree).

If only by giving young people a reason to stay there or return there.

Also, consider this: Europe has a massive guilty conscience over how the Yugoslavian wars were allowed to escalate into bitter bloodshed. And if Yugoslavia had never split up, it would have become an EU member a long time ago. So closing that hole in the side of the EU is a sort of moral imperative.

Yet if you looks at examples where interventions should have been made, but weren't, the horrific consequences are clear and obvious.

Intervention in former Yugoslavia was especially easy to do, as it was in the end and it worked very well, because the enemy was a weak disorganized, demoralized band of stupid assholes and rapists - who only managed to spread and cause so much misery because corrupted, politicized, distorted, inefficient, pathetic, ludicrous  UN allowed them to continue with what they were doing, (while engaging in various atrocities, mass rape and human slave trade too), -  while defending people were prohibited from dealing with it and even punished by arms embargo.

On their religious scriptures. The Qur'an calls the faithful to ritual worship, fasting, alms-giving, the proclamation of Goodness and the rejection of corruption.

The reason we spend so much on development is because it increases our capabilities thereby allowing us to reduce the number of personnel required to meet the requirements of that policy. The f-35 and the f-22 move the US towards Over the Horizon capabilities. That means that instead of shooting enemy planes down in a turn and burn dogfight we can shoot them from over the horizon of the earth. So while China and Russia continue to invest in turn and burn fighters like the Mig-29 and SU-37 that would have excelled in the 90's, we are building fighters capable of fighting into the next century. That means that in the long run we will need less fighters and less pilots ie) long term money savings. We build carriers because most of ours are outdated and due or even overdue for replacement. We continually increase infantry capabilities because that allows smaller and smaller elements to control larger and larger areas of the battle space, which again means less personnel in the long run.

One possibility is that Livingstone and others have simply an incorrect view of history. They are mistaken about Hitler and his intentions despite the evidence.

The other option is that Livingstone knows what he's doing and that it's an intentional move to try to skew history with language. If you can redefine slightly the accepted definition of Zionism to be simply ""the movement of Jews out of Europe"" then you can redefine the concept as something that Hitler supported, and therefore as a ""bad"" thing.

Then you have a kind of paranoid authoritarian xenophobic nationalism combined with fundie Christianity on the other hand, which is the talk-radio narrative held by working class Republicans. These two simply do not go together; you can't have both free trade and plentiful blue collar jobs, or both an end to immigration and a growing GDP. Because these two groups of people have contradictory narratives and want entirely different things, they come into conflict often, and then of course the richer group of people always wins.

Copy pasting old effort-post:

-------------

The closest thing we have to the idea of ""pure"" socialism, I would say, is [Norway's democratic socialism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) It still has many capitalistic features, of course, but it also has many socialistic features. 

[Scandinavia in general](http://www.vexen.co.uk/countries/best.html) is pretty similar, as well.

In the 1920s, the economy was pretty bad in Europe, and the situation in Norway was no exception. In addition to dealing with the fallout of other nations' economic problems in various ways, Norway had mass-produced wares for World War I, and suddenly there was no demand (among other problems like increased inequality and lack of industrial materials). 

The deflation that followed was absolutely devastating, and no amount of individualism would solve the problem: the individual farmer or fisher had no other choice but to try to increase production to sell more, but that only drove the prices down and forced people to increase production even further. For the industrial worker, refusal to accept the much lower wages due to deflation resulted in strikes met by lockouts and strike breakers.

There was no other choice but to cooperate, and so people came together and formed the dairy product cooperatives, for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tine_(company)

This forced cooperation throughout the workers due to the deflation crisis set the stage for what was going to be the Norwegian way of doing things even to this day.

[The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions) became a prevalent force, and it has been closely connected to the Norwegian Labour Party ever since its inception (and they have extremely close ties even today).

Meanwhile in the 1920s, the extremely left-wing Labour Party in Norway went through a bit of a change and split up into various factions: the Communist Party, the Social Democrats, and the Labour Party.

In 1927, the party merged with the Social Democrats again, and they actually formed the government for 18 whole days in 1928. The king asked them to form government as they were the biggest party, but because Norway has negative parliamentarism, they were taken down by a no confidence vote by the Norwegian parliament: Stortinget. 

After this, they realized that complete reform was off the table, and so they calmed down their radical, revolutionary sentiment.

In 1933, they put out an [extremely well-done propaganda poster](http://i.imgur.com/PaiT7oy.jpg) all over Norway. 
(""City and land, hand in hand. The entirety of the people at work."")

They handily won the election as democratic socialists under the name ""The Norwegian Labour Party"", which is what they were called until very recently when they changed their name back to just ""Labour Party"". (DNA: Det Norske Arbeiderparti).

It wasn't until 1935 that they had a ""pure"" government, however, and since 1935 they have been in charge of Norway almost the entire time. The Labour Party took Keynes' new theories to heart, just as Roosevelt did with his New Deal, and things improved dramatically for Norway up until the German invasion.

The years after World War II are considered the ""golden age"" of the Labour Party with a supermajority control of the government. The prime minster from this period, Einar Gerhardsen, goes by the nickname ""Landsfaderen"" (the father of the nation) for his fantastic work in rebuilding Norway after World War II with the help of Keynes' economic theories.

After finding oil (the Ekofisk discovery in 1969 was a pivotal find), the profits were socialized through the state owned company Statoil in 1972, and the economy was boosted as a result.

This find helped Norway secure an emergency fund for lasting through crises, which is one of the major reasons why Norway has survived so well through the 2008 depression.

In total, there were only 16 years since 1935 that the Norwegian Labour Party was not in charge, and they have been socialistic the entire time.

---------

Now, a couple of points on Scandinavia. First of all, if you link me to historical revisionism from mises.org, I might punch you over the internet.

Furthermore:

1) Size is a poor excuse. A higher population makes things more difficult but by no means impossible. Besides, you could easily make the comparison of the EU as a whole compared to the US in arguments such as universal healthcare, etc.

2) Homogeneity is certainly helpful, but not anywhere near as important as racists claim. What's more important are factors that interact with and reinforce homogeneity across cultural borders: [equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) and [overall peace.](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index) These factors play off of each other along with homogeneity, but to claim that homogeneity is the sole cause or something is ignorant.

3) The oil argument is libertarian / conservative propaganda.

The social safety net in Norway has historically been paid for by **high taxes**, not the Government Pension Fund (oil fund). If it were paid for by oil money, it wouldn't be sustainable in the least (the fund, even though it is huge, would be gone in a few short years).

It is against the rules to spend more than 4% of the fund per year. Since it is an emergency fund, it is taken care of well. Some years (like 2007), it's not touched at all and just grows.

It is a myth that it is simply oil money that lead to the success in Norway: sound fiscal policy, spread wealth, technology building, nationalization of the energy sector, high education, stable global region, close situation to the market, predictable and stable government, balanced mix between taxes and benefits...the list goes on.

Furthermore, Norway, ever since around 1850s, has never been poor in relation to other countries. Even before Norway found oil,  it had a better standard of living and GDP per capita than for example Sweden.

That Norway has historically been extremely poor is bad history that you'll hear all over the place, but **it is wrong.** If you want to argue this point, take it up with [this professor of economic history.](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Honningdal_Grytten)

Here's [one link to his book](http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/71b541ce552753e1f72b328437e87bad.nbdigital;jsessionid=06CDCD2F18069EDBDAC7027175119C53.nbdigital3?lang=en#0), but I'm not sure if you can access it.

Finally: **Sweden is also a very similar country to Norway, and Sweden is doing just fine without the oil.**",t5_2qh13

Boers to me are obvious #1 picks. They are 16 goddamn techs ahead of 3rd place in techs, and even without declaring wars Finland also remains a top 6 pick and they are even farther back in techs. Do I need to remind everyone that Finland has declared a single relevant war?



Iceland literally just did what everyone was begging them to do, go to war with France. They are currently at a point where we can safely say that they will gain 5-8 more cities, including numerous High pop cities. Iceland is also no longer technologically backwards, and they have a HUGE fleet of advanced destroyers and Missile cruisers, so I see no reason to put them lower than they already were.


Yakutia is in no way 8th place. Sleepy, weak, and increasingly farther behind technologically. They could be conquered by Mongolia at this point.


Canada just DoW'd a civ with a paratrooper carpet while they currently wield GWI. If that wasn't enough, they have a fairly aggresive  giant up north. Even If the Blackfoot don't take a city, Canadia will be weakened


Chile is in a position where they are able to survive basically any attack excluding the Aussies. And that alone puts them above the Middle east and lesser European civs+ lesser Asian civs.


Sparta. Just look at their lands, that's enough evidence.



Arabia is in the Info era. And what are their neighbors in? What's that? Did you say they still have rifleman? Oh my.


The Kimberley are strong but now they are trapped between 2 terrifyingly strong navies.


The Mali are split up, and their pop is still recovering from the nukes, and with two carpets, the strongest navy in the world, and a fairly strong army surrounding them, do they really have any hope.

They need massive amounts of capital and energy which in this current environment is completely unprofitable. They'd be losing money extracting a barrel out of the ground.

[Their break-even cost for drilling is $111.30 per barrel for fuck sakes.](http://graphics.wsj.com/oil-producers-break-even-prices/)

But by all means, continue to attack social programs instead. It just goes to show you how brainwashed people can be to the point of attacking money from national lands going to the social welfare of a nation instead of ending up in the pockets of crony capitalists.

____________
**EDIT**

The 'extraction' cost cited below isn't an indicator that it is at all what you can sell it for when the [vast majority of Venezuelan oil is in tar sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Venezuela#Oil), similar to Canada's.

[Using Alberta as an example, their heavy oil were selling at low of $8 per barrel over January of this year while WTI ('regular' crude) was hovering around $30.](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Forget-20-Oil-Prices-At-8-Per-Barrel-In-Canada.html)

[And this is a country that is literally right next door to ours, and it still costs $20 per barrel to transport alone because the stuff is so thick and diluted.](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022016/tar-sands-becoming-worthless-production-rises-even-prices-plummet)

But why? if you're losing money extracting oil... you shouldn't do it? Venezuela doesn't actually *want* to default, just like how Canadian operators don't. They've already invested in the equipment (Capital Expenditure) and they can still sell oil at (probably) a marginal 'profit' if you only consider Operational Expenditure (workers).

So to make interest payments and to defer a default, they continue pumping in hopes that oil prices will rise soon. Shutting down an entire operation and starting it back up is also rather expensive in and of itself.",t5_2qh13

Perhaps for these reasons, India and America would not necessarily be ""greatest of friends"", atleast in the near future, because of the difference in views.

His stance on oil and gas is going to make everything more expensive. Oil and gas just isn't used for energy. Refined products from them also provide the chemicals needed to make just about everything in the modern world. Fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, plastics, lubricants, etc. If the USA takes fracking off the table and also stops new drilling. Then major oil exporters, who tend to be be nasty countries, can roll back production. The price of oil and gas will skyrocket all over the world. Oppressive oil exporting countries will be flush with cash. While western economies suffer. 

Nuclear is one of the safest and most environmental energy sources of all time. In the 65 years or so, there has only been two major incidents, both caused by a lack of oversight. Fukushima was also caused by a once in a thousand year natural disaster event.France has been safely using nuclear power for 75% of its electricity needs for decades. New nuclear power plant designs are many times safer than current plants in operation. They can sit idle for a week with just passive water circulation to keep it cool and safe. Thorium Reactors can burn old uranium nuclear fuel to make electricity. With the end waste being tiny compared to the waste that went in. Permanent waste storage has never been an issue. It was just blocked by people like Senator Harry Reid(D) and the NIMBY crowd.

Geothermal power is only viable in a small number of areas. Solar and wind have their place but it isn't as a primary power source. Solar and wind will also need the construction of battery banks to store electricity for when the sun and wind are not there. 

The previous American Assault Weapon Ban did nothing. The Australian and UK gun control laws did little. In Australia, gun deaths went down, but total murders remained the same for a decade after. The Australians also faced a significant increase in other violent crimes not involving guns. Australian gangs now smuggle in guns from outside the country, or they make machine guns. Knife attacks in the UK went up so much. That you can't buy a fork with out showing ID, being 18-21 years old, and signing a list. UK and Australia still have had ""mass shooting"" events since gun control. The EU in response to the ISIS attacks in France and Belgium want to ban all the guns in Europe. Even if it means overriding the laws of pro gun EU nations. Even though the weapons used in the ISIS attacks were smuggled in from outside the EU and were already banned in France and Belgium. 


His immigration stance is this same middle of the road nonsense. that is keeping us in the illegal immigrant mess. If all someone has to do is illegally cross in, have a kid, and then keep from being deported for some years to then be made legal. Then we will keep having an illegal immigrant problem. No one really wants to get fix the problem either. They are an easy and cheap way to grow the population. Which allows GDP growth through simple addition of consumers. It also allows for pro immigrant political parties to add voters. The so called ""anti immigrant"" party secretly condones it. Since they are cheap disposable labor. You can't be for poor struggling americans and not do something about labor supply. 

There is a solution between just letting anyone into the country and Trump's Wall. You keep on deporting illegals and their minor children as you find them. Though put most of your effort into jailing those that employ them. If they can't find work, then they won't come. ",t5_2cneq

Regen hunting, watching the coefficients rise, more playable teams, bigger database, 3-D options or a few different 2-D options.

But for me I find going through every under 19's, under 21's of each country, setting up affiliates across the globe, watching players develop on loan are apart of the fun. My favourite part of FM is the post season player of the year, team of the year and seeing if our league climbed in standard or gaining another place in Europe. Stuff that you don't see on mobile.

I grew up in a place where delicious fish is easy to get. Sockeye, fresh trout, great tuna... It's all readily and easily available. And so it is that I had steady access to really good fish dishes. One of my favorites growing up, of course, was fish and chips.

A few years ago, I went on a big tour of countries in Europe that I'd always wanted to visit - specifically England, the Netherlands, and France. I didn't stick to the large cities, like London, Amsterdam, and Paris, though I did see all three. And I had the benefit of having cousins who lived in London at the time, who could show me around and help me avoid tourist traps in favor of great local cuisine.

The first clue I was in a place with a weird relationship to food was on first arrival in London. I was hungry, and found a sandwich chain called EAT not too far from the airport. It was strictly OK, nothing to write home about. The only reason I remember it at all is that when I told my cousins where I'd gotten some food, they told me I'd found one of the better quick deli-ish restaurant chains in the city. I was flummoxed. The bread was generic sourdough, kind of soggy, and the lettuce was limp. It wasn't *horrible*, but it was hard to imagine anyone would consider it pretty good.

I soon learned, however, that EAT and Indian restaurants were my only hope for food worth eating. My cousins took me to several places they considered to cover the very best of English cuisine during my London stay, and none of it was particularly palatable.

When I finally worked up the courage to ask them what the best fish and chips restaurant was, I no longer had much hope. But they told me about this place that does excellent, and very traditional fish and chips, and is even well known for having a patron who's been there every Friday evening for something like thirty years. That's brand loyalty! I looked the restaurant up online, and it had four-star ratings everywhere. So gradually, I started to hope that at long last, I'd get my quality English food experience.

When we get there, it's packed, and there are people enjoying mushy peas and blood sausages and all sorts of other English favorites at every table. Rubbing my hands together, I order the fish and chips, with mushy peas, and wait expectantly.

It arrives, and... Meh. It's OK. There's too much breading, and it's not salted enough, and the chips are overly oily, and... Meh. The little fish market downtown at home makes way better.

This experience would be emblematic of food disappointment I'd feel all over England. London or Dover, it didn't matter, the food was universally meh, unless we were eating at a Pakistani or Indian restaurant. It's sad, but the best food of my time in England wasn't English food at all.

By way of contrast, I stopped in a little town called Ardris in France, at a restaurant that was basically a truck stop. My French wasn't good enough to figure out what the plat du jour was, but I went with it anyhow. Turned out to be cold, salted pork in aspic.

&gt;Most Jews are perfectly nice people. But percentage-wise Jews seem to be way more likely to be leftist and pro-multiculti than whites, unless they're in Israel. They are also smarter than whites on average, and seem more prone to subversiveness, have interests as a group that do not always align with ours, and because of the concentration camps during WWII, it is basically impossible to level any criticism, no matter how legitimate, against international Jewry without having people immediately screaming ""ANTI-SEMITE! RACIST! NAZI! HITLER!"" and trying to dismiss your concerns...yet it's perfectly okay to level criticisms against whites. Like I said, most Jews are good people, and certainly many Jews have contributed a great deal...but I would say Jewish influence overall has been harmful to indigenous Europeans. It doesn't matter how many scientific, cultural, or artistic advancements Jews have contributed if their influence ultimately results in Europeans losing our homeland and our future, which seems to be what might happen.

&gt;Since most Jews are good people, I wish them no harm. But ideally I would want them gone, and not ""dead and gone,"" but simply away from us. Somewhere where they can't hurt us anymore, somewhere we can be free of their influence, so that we can have self-determination as a people. Our interests completely conflict--Jews like a diverse, individualistic, rampantly liberal society (unless Jews are the majority), whereas whites suffer in societies like this. Whites thrive in a homogeneous, nationalistic society that is moderate/conservative. Considering Europe is our land, our needs come first...and we can tell by looking at Israel that when Jews are the majority they choose to create a society that is remarkably similar to what we would create if everyone would just leave us alone. I don't see why it's right that Jews should be able to create a society like that, while whites can't.",t5_2s4m9

Most software EULAs aren't worth the paper (or in this case, bytes) they are written on - they are *not* law nor do they supercede local laws. If you don't believe me go and read some of the EULAs supplied with FS addons, they are laughable. For example I know Iris claim the copyright to the ""likeness"" of all their addon aircraft. I think the aircraft manufacturers might take issue with that.

The issue with selling used addons is of course is whether or not the vendors/publishers will honour the activations of a piece of second hand software, and whether or not you are prepared to take them to court if they don't.

The flightsim addon market is a legal mess. Let's say a guy in the US buys an Orbx addon from the Flightsim Store. Orbx are a British company, the Flightsimstore in an Australian company but operate from servers located in Hong Kong. Whose laws apply?

In early medieval times, kings often appointed bishops themselves and as such wielded both temporal and ecclesiastical power. In Catholic Europe the Pope fought, by word and by sword, for the power to appoint Bishops himself. In some places, like Germany, the Pope was ultimately victorious. In other places there was a compromise where the Pope choose bishops in consensus with the local ecclesiastical hierarchy, in a few places the Pope lost and bishops remained under royal rule.

The reformation begins a new era in this power struggle, where the most dissatisfied rulers simply switch to protestantism and cut the Pope out entirely, subordinating the church to their rule. Areas that remained Catholic generally saw the state drastically increase in power, and Monarchs heavily curtailing the power and influence of the Pope and his bishops in favour of their own.

Then in the enlightenment the concept of separation of church and state is developed, both as a further curtailment of papal power in Catholic states, and from a burgeoning concept of national identity and human rights which transcended religious affiliations. The French Revolution spreads these ideas across continental Europe.

The inability of the Pope to maintain control of the larger Papal States against the movement for a unified Italian state, and later on the complete inefficacy of the Pope's attempts to prevent and stop the first World War, can be seen as the final loss of Religious identity to National and Class identity and with it the general disappearance of religion as a major transnational political force in the West. Religion of course remains a potent political force, but it is always ultimately subordinate to National or Class identity and is largely expunged from the structures of government in favour of pure national institutions centred around those National or Class identities.",t5_2qh13

I don't know how true this is. Anti-Muslim sentiment is worryingly ""acceptable"" in many parts of the country, and the dog-whistle politics of the Conservatives in the mayoral election are an illustration of how effective it can be. People don't necessarily call people out on anti-Muslim sentiment as fast as they should.

Even the whole rail guidance system is trimmed for passenger transportation and gives passenger trains the right of way - which is the other way round in the US and a major hinderance for the Acela for example which is quite often literally stuck behind a freight train that is late but still has the right of way. 

Yes if a new ice track is finished and thus the old track gets less passenger trains and thus frees up capacity for freight trains then this capacity will be used, but this is just a side effect of the major investment in passenger rail. 

Another example - almost all rail companies are stopping the use of direct tracks to manufacturers - with exceptions for major customers and instead offer a road to rail service - basically a pick up by truck to the next larger freight station - this results in a minus of the freight rail users since the goods have to be unloaded and transferred at the station again - so a lot of companies actually transfer their whole freight to the road in bulk.

-----

What in Netherlands was in past:

------

* loyal supporter of the EU. 

* many Dutch being cosmopolitan, tolerant members, peaceful  &amp; participation in the EU as a logical extension of this.

-----

What is now - far right:

------

* 2005 refusing the EU constitution = change of attitudes toward the EU. &lt;= Why: rejection of the EU’s neoliberal economic policies demolishing social services &amp; national chauvinism.

* 2016 refusing the Treaty = blocking cooperation with it

* Nationalist right wing advancing for 15 years. Established parties have partly taken over their vocabulary and agenda. Left not able to adequately respond.

* Freedom Party (PVV) combine free-market economics, nationalism, populist demagogy, xenophobic sentiment, racism, especially Islamophobia. EU seen as a threat to sovereignty &amp; obstacle to the draconian anti-immigration laws. Wish EU be purely economic free-trade zone. 

* Dominates the recent public debate: referendum, refugee policies. Refugees and politicians who are seen as supporting their rights have been the victims of intimidation and violence. Agitation against refugees is the prelude to more general racist actions: attacks on Muslim citizens and threats to mosques.

* Polls consistently predict a massive victory for the PVV.

* Influence of a conservative intellectual T. Baudet &amp; think tank Forum voor Democrati: Anti-feminism, nationalism, and Islamopohobia, hostility to the Left, hidden racism. Forum like Geenstijl provides the populist vulgarization of the same agenda.

-----

What is now - center left &amp; right wing &amp; social-liberal:

------

* The social-democratic Labour Party (PvdA) neoliberal D66 party:  neoliberal economic policies combined with socially liberal rhetoric about individual rights. Support the Treaty. However absence of any positive argument in favor of the treaty &amp; pseudo-arguments: treaty would protect Jews, the LGBT community, and Ukrainian democrats against Putin’s authoritarianism. 

* Polls consistently predict an implosion of the PvdA.

----

What is now - far left

----

* Socialist Party (SP) “No” campaign &lt;= the neoliberal character of the association treaty &amp; chauvinism. Part of left called for a boycott of the referendum. Many SP voters did not vote at all. The SP is in decline: declining membership and disorder in its youth wing.

* Polls predict around its current 10 percent.

* Some socialists, NGOs, and independent activists (collaborating with Ukrainian leftists!) “No” campaign &lt;= calling for radically reforming the process of European unification and rejecting the EU’s neoliberal course.

-----

Conclusion:

-----

* Government parties are under pressure to give some meaning to the referendum result. Few people assume the referendum will change much. The Treaty already became provisionally active, most people expect that it will be ratified (like the EU constitution).

* The clear winner of the whole episode is the nationalist right. Political climate in general favor the right-wing nationalist response, which would exclude Muslims and other minorities.

* Pushing back against this trend is difficult, requiring a new emphasis on class issues instead of national, religious, and ethnic divisions.

The first half of the mission was fine, went rather smoothly with Alpha operating well with one another, taking objectives like a champ. Overall Alpha 1 was a pretty good team with decent coordination between not only us but the rest of the elements in the Alpha squad.

The very last bit though got on my nerves a little, regarding how it was undertaken.

After running into the Research location, I notice that I'm getting shot at from a place that nobody even bothered to clear. The reason why hurts my head when thinking about it; especially when there were at least a fireteams-worth of guys on standby just standing on the road.

I tried clearing it alone by myself, foolishly I'll admit, and after popping two dudes I go unconcious, and it takes about a minute for someone to notice.

After someone notices though, it starts to *sound* like a clusterfuck, with from what I hear, about two people going unconcious, not taking note that there's a *dood* lieing, bleeding out on the ground.

Then, just as it looks like I'm about to get up:

	&gt;hey dudes teleport time bazingo

Despite lieing there more or less alone with Dom's worried voice travelling in my ear canal, I wasn't exposed to the shitshow that was whatever the teleport thing was with the flashbang.

Another thing I'd like to note is that regarding the briefing, it'd be grand to get it done sooner, as usually I have to go to bed earlier due to schoolwork, like most Europeans in our group. It sort of pisses me off internally when it's taking 25 minutes on the map screen to get through the basis of the mission, and even after that it took 19 minutes on top of it to reach first contact with my time in Alpha 1

They push the idea of “white privilege” but when it comes to money, power, arrests, media representation, etc. Jews have far more “white privilege” than whites do. Yet every single lecturer on white privilege is Jewish, and they never mention Jewish privilege. During the “conversation about race” in Hollywood and in the Oscars, how many times did anyone say the word “Jew”?
They also push multiculturalism in Europe, assuring Europeans they will assimilate (a best case scenario that most people here still find undesirable) despite the fact that Jews spent over five thousand years not assimilating into Europe. They openly say they are the master race, god’s chosen people. Their whole religion is based on subversion and domination of other tribes. And any noticing of this blatant non-Jewish hostility they show is perversely labelled as “anti-Semitism” or “white supremacy”.
They push the genital mutilation of baby boys, even with oral suction by syphilitic rabbis, in the most advanced nations in the twenty first century and get away with it. They take WW2, a massacre wherein between a hundred to a hundred and twenty million Europeans lost their lives, and focus almost exclusively on the suspiciously exact number of six million. How many people have you heard say that six million people died in the camps, despite the official number being between ten to twelve million. Not six million people. Six million Jews. But I guess the goyim aren’t people, more like two legged cattle.
Do you ever hear about the Jewish Bolsheviks killing over a hundred million Russians? What about after every terrorist attack in Europe or the US the Israelis celebrate, because they know this will result in more support for them? What about the way they protested Donald Trump for saying “America first” (oy vey, it should be Israel first) What about “the Samson Option” wherein they plan to drop nuclear bombs on their allies in case Israel should ever fall.
They have no problem, even openly push for, the extermination of blonde haired, blue eyed Aryans with chiselled features. They play down and insist that any ebony skinned yellow eyed Somalian can assimilate and integrate to Europa. And then demand ethnic and cultural protection for their nasty little desert cult, and racial preservation of clubbed feet, beady eyes and hook noses.
So yeah, even though Jews are “more intelligent” with slightly higher IQs. Only Ashkenazi Jews, not Israeli Jews, who have lower IQs. So the idea that they were hated over thousands of years and driven out of over a hundred countries because of “envy” rather than their nasty little ethno cult, based on the dominance of other races, laughable.

Not really. The market has become so competitive in the past 15 years that its ridiculous to justify one car demanding such a premium over its competition on an entirely level playing field. That's the reason toyota's advertising is obsolete. 20-30 years ago, Toyota actually had an advantage in the used market on behalf of its reliability. Most American cars sucked. For the same price as a Cavalier, you could buy a better made, more efficient, more reliable Japanese car that would ""last a lifetime."" Since the mid 2000s the domestic and european market cleaned up their act to the point where there is no discernible difference in reliability or efficiency but yet Toyota still rides off the bullshit that their cars have engines made of diamond and fairy dust.",t5_2qhl2

These countries aren't littered with policies that destroy the private sector, and as far as I'm concerned they work so well because the few restrictions they have work in such a way so as to not allow for loopholes (which creates corporatism such as in the U.S.) and not encourage companies to leave.

This plus the massive tax rates in those nations, plus very beneficial trade with European nations are some of the reasons as to why Nordic nations prosper (coupled with low population rates, and massive economic booms in the 70s &amp; 80s [maybe 90s]  during periods of low restrictions)

Pipelines are in place already in Turkey to receive the gas. Only Al-Assad is in the way. Qatar along with the Turks would like to remove Al-Assad and install the Syrian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is the best organized political movement in the chaotic society and can block Saudi Arabia's efforts to install a more fanatical Wahhabi based regime.

Exemple simple. Dans beaucoup de villes/pays d'europe, quand on aménage des pistes cyclables, on prévoit la voie cyclable près du troittoir, et la rangée de véhicules stationnés sert de buffer entre la circulation des voitures et les cyclistes. Ici, on voit des deux aléatoirement, mais beaucoup plus souvent la voie cyclable est du côté de la circulation des autos (qui doivent en plus passer par dessus la piste cyclable pour se stationner ou sortir d'une place de stationnement).

*(Un problème plus large ici est que de manière générale il n'y a pas la moindre calice de cohérence—d'un arrondissement ou ville à l'autre, ou même dans un même arrondissement ou ville, les façons de faire sont différentes. C'est ahurissant combien il n'y a pas de vision d'ensemble pour quoi que ce soit.)*

Parlant de design stupide...

It's something of a cultural meme among Germans to complain about bread in the US. This goes back to past decades when all you could find in some US grocery stores was mushy white bread. Germans, as you know, take bread very seriously, so they just *love* to complain about it. 

Here is the thing though: This is 2016, and there is plenty of good bread available all over the place. In fact, I have never been anywhere in the US where there was no good bread available. If you don't find it, you are not looking hard enough. Of course this may not be German bread, but there are always French bakeries, Jewish bakeries, Russian bakeries, and more and more American artisan bakeries. 

I'm sure you are already doing this, but it may be worth to remind your German students to keep an open mind and try what's good locally. And if they get too homesick, they can order German pumpernickel-style Vollkornbrot on Amazon. A case of 6 packs is less than $20 - not much more expensive than in Germany. Stores forever too, so this is actually great frugal food. :D

As for the prices, I definitely don't think they are wrong, but I do think they generalize a bit much. I am German born and raised and spent the first 25 years of my life in southern Germany. What is definitely true is that the government uses these market baskets to determine the minimum amount of money people need to live, which in turn influences the social welfare programs. So the basket informs the amount of government aid people may receive - maybe that's what your students meant?

The reasons I am so certain there are no general set prices are these:

1. There are very cheap groceries in Germany, but there are also very high priced items. A 25 cents yogurt and a 1.50 euro yogurt - same stuff, different label. Who decides who can sell what at what prices? And would this happen at the commodity level, at the wholesale level, or at the retail level? Apart from the logistics, one would assume this would be a huge topic of discussion in the news all the time, but I don't read anything about this despite reading German news every day. 

2. Even though Germany has very strong government welfare programs compared to the US, there are other European countries where the government takes a much more active role, especially the Scandinavian countries. Yet, prices for food are  *sky high* in countries like Denmark and Norway and less affordable to their citizens. One would think that those countries would have similar programs to keep food affordable if such a policy existed in Germany.

Now, there *are* definitely price caps on other things such as drugs  and books (interestingly). I need to do a bit more research on this.

Instead, they've got probably the largest worker cooperative federation on Earth, Mondragon, amongst traditional capitalist businesses.

Wouldn't you know it, that mixture has worked stunningly well. Very little inequality, very high standard of living, no policies of taxing the rich or anything, no welfare state, no big government...! The problem for many socialists is that

- It still operates through the market system, and if anything it could be called 'worker capitalism'

&gt; The shipwrecks are the latest incidents in which hundreds of people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean.

Fuck manufacturing. The 6% of the arable land lies nearly fallow. Most of the farmers are old with little replacement on the line. Of the gdp, Agriculture makes 0.5-0.8% of it. It's folly.

Not only that, but the huge car culture and diesel-oil infrastructure means fuel goes to around 58% of something - just that it's a big element of the budget. For an island that one slightly above average guy can walk from Salinas to San Juan in a day and from Mayaguez to Humacao in a day on a bike. We cut that car culture, we cut a strain on the standard cost of living on the island.

I say: bring back agriculture in force. Irrigate and plant the land, build desalination plants, switch to hydropower, bring in the damn Costa Ricans for the latter and bring in some Canarians for the former and Israelis for the middle part if you have to. 

The government tried to turn a Caribbean island into a pittsburg factory. Didn't work. The only thing left now is : a lot of land, and a lot of people.

Then we have to curtail costs to Puerto Rican shipping, since, again, we're an island, but an island with nine good ports and right between Europe and Panama.

You have to have power. A stock of explosives, guns, and ammo is essential. Also, swords and tools to sharpen them, after that runs out. Solar panels to run a computer with a large array of ssds, many duplicates in case they die, on how to refine metal, make gunpowder, etc. How electricity works, how to make industrial machines. 

Oh yeah, that's another thing. You want to start an industrial revolution. You could probably accomplish it within the century. The Americas did not have domesticated animals, with the exception of the llama, so you're going to have to make wood burning steam engines, at least initially, to make work significantly more efficient. A railroad system soon after, also the telegraph. I don't know if that area has a large amount of coal, but that would be a natural step up. Also, how to make fertilizer is very important, something to maintain a large scale manufacture of such would be important. 


It looks like biofuel might be the way to grow your empire, sugar beets and sugar cane appear to be the most efficient.

Some of these titles will be obvious as to why, but I'll try to briefly summarize why these are important and how they connect.

* **Less than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave and Exterminate Others** by David Livingstone Smith
* **This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate** by Naomi Klein
* **Capital in the Twenty-First Century** by Thomas Piketty
* **A People's History of the United States** by Howard Zinn

Smith is an excellent read about the all-too-natural tendency to dehumanize ""others"" or those not in our tribal ""in-group""; historically, this has resulted in such atrocities as the Holocaust, as well as lesser things like scapegoating other races, ethnicities or different groups—and can be seen in some of Trump's rhetoric as well as the discriminatory ordinances passed under the guise of ""religious freedom"" in many states.

The Klein presents an overall view of climate change as well as the socioeconomic changes needed to combat it successfully. Many of these—which involve pooling of resources and reducing high-polluting free trade—align strongly with what Piketty argues must be done to save unbridled, oligarchic capitalism from itself. As many might be aware, Piketty also strongly stresses capital and income inequality in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world, issues that have been at the forefront of the U.S. democratic presidential primary.

Finally, tying together Smith's description of dehumanization and the inequalities of Piketty into an encompassing historical framework, Zinn present a somewhat bleak, enraging counterfactual to the whitewashed ""great man"" version of American history with which many people are familiar. Note though that Zinn is a political author writing a historical polemic, not attempting to be a non-biased historian (to whatever degree this is possible), but if one is familiar with the gist of American history, this can flesh out details from the perspective of the downtrodden, native everyman.

Fair point. And maybe to add to that, there might be less reason for frustration with these expenses IF there were a board composed of general membership that look after such things. I mean yes, the church has an Audit Committee but without the finances being public that is meaningless. So I guess when you add closed finances to the mix it can seem much worse.

Again, I guess my only point was that to those unfamiliar with how even the average business traveler could easily spend 600 euro a night on a hotel just because Europe is expensive, these stories might seem inflated. AND my further point was that these stories aren't exactly some dramatic smoking gun in my opinion. BUT, I do agree that we have a right to expect more when 1. the finances are closed and 2. we are only told that the finances are are dealt with as if they were the widow's mite. THEY set that standard and it seems many don't live up to it. If they began with the expectation that this is a corporation then we would have different expectations entirely.

&gt; CANBERRA, Australia - A new fleet of French-designed Australian submarines will be built in Australia on time and within budget, the French prime minister said on Monday.

&gt; Valls dismissed speculation that at least the first 97-meter long Shortfin Barracuda subs would be built in a DCNS shipyard in France before construction shifted to the Australian manufacturing hub of Adelaide.

&gt; ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Australia chairman John White said last week that while he was disappointed that the German bid had not been selected, his company stood ready to support the French project through its personnel&amp;#039;s experience in building submarines in Australia.

However, I decided to have a look around myself, and while I agree with the broader claims you're making, I feel that you omitted some key details.

First of all, whole the groundwork of the science of computer networking was laid in the US (although many European computer scientists contributed to our understanding of large scale transmission of data), the internet (the World Wide Web, as opposed to smaller intranet networks) that we know and use today was first established at CERN in Switzerland, by the British Tim Berners-Lee.

While computing and data manipulation as a whole has a very long history, I would say that the German Z3 or the British Colossus  marked the birth of modern computing. Otherwise, while the ENIAC is certainly a contender, its design was built on the work of foreign computer engineers like Alan Turing, among others. Otherwise, the British SSEM may also be considered, as it was the first stored-program computer.

French was widely used as the lingua franca of international affairs until the mid-20th century, and it was even considered as the language of the UN (don't cite me on this). Additionally, UN treaties are always written in both French and English. 

Out of the countries and regions you listed, I agree that most did not speak English during the days of British colonialism (although several you listed, most obviously the Middle East, were either partially or directly affected by British colonialism or under the British sphere of influence), but I don't believe 'most' people in those places can speak English (having lived in China and Japan and having family from both places, I can attest that only a large minority can speak English, and more often than not they're taught under the British Council system). I would be interested to see the statistics in other regions, however. 

I feel like 'most' schools is hyperbolic, but I won't deny that English is widely spoken. What I would be skeptical of is the degree of American influence in this education, and I don't believe the US would be a primary driver of the demand for English learning.

I'm very skeptical of any attempts to gauge the cultural influence of a particular country or another, and I don't know the extent of influence American popular culture has had on the spread of English- if you could provide me your sources I would be very interested in taking a look.

&gt; NXP’s Mifare NXP’s family of Mifare card and reader ICs is built on the ISO 14443 Type A standard. Mifare cards support multiple applications, each capable of operating independently of the others through user definable key sets and access conditions. Readers are capable of reading any variety of Mifare card, and NXP certifies both cards and readers to ensure compatibility across generations. According to Martin Gruber, segment director for the Transit Team at NXP, Mifare is the “overall umbrella brand” for a portfolio of products. Mifare Classic is the original NXP product that was introduced in 1995-96 when the 14443 standard was first released. Mifare Plus was launched in 2009 and features higher security than Mifare Classic. DESfire is the newest and most advanced product, providing the highest level of security and flexibility.

&gt; Sony’s FeliCa could be the most varied of the contactless flavors, complying with a different ISO standard. To date it has seen the majority of its use in Asian markets, but the notion that it is only relevant in Asia is an image Sony is trying to correct. FeliCa was introduced in Hong Kong in 1997, says Jun Shionozaki, technical consulting manager for FeliCa Business Division at Sony. It was introduced to the Japanese market in 2001. “It’s deployed in other parts of Asia, Europe and the U.S.,” says Shionozaki. FeliCa has an extremely strong presence in Japan because of the maturity of the country’s mobile market. As of June 2010, 67 million Japanese handsets embedded with mobile FeliCa chips were in circulation, says Shionozaki. FeliCa is based on the ISO 18902 standard that defines near field communication. “We decided to focus on the 18092 standard which covers a wide range, including mobile,” says Shionozaki. Some aspects of the FeliCa system are open. “We comply with 18092, in that sense we can be considered open,” says Shionozaki. FeliCa uses encryption algorithms that are open standard as well, but it maintains a set of proprietary security elements. Sony says its FeliCa card is the first contactless card to achieve EA4L security. “It’s the highest level for consumer products,” says Shionozaki.",t5_2qkob

We have an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants alone, and that's just an estimate, it could be significantly higher for all we know.  Our total population is over 330 million.  Also, those countries, sans Sweden, are mostly homogeneous.  And we're seeing the repercussions of failed multiculturalism in Sweden right now.  It's significantly easier to have those kinds of systems in countries with very small populations that are homogeneous.  Now if you want to further divide the country up into more autonomous regions, things get far less complicated.  But in our current system, socialism can't work.  And the amount of business that would leave this country would kill it, and people forget how much we subsidize for so many other countries with the innovation we provide.

Man City making money available to Guardiola to buy 'superstars' will not prevent him from promoting young talent into the first team, he has had money to spend at his previous clubs and has still brought young players in.

The Arabs were the first to bring it to Europe during the middle ages, then later on the Portugese managed to mount an expedition and also trade the commodity. When the VOC, the Dutch United East India Company arrived, conquered the islands (committing genocide of the local natives in the process who went from a population of 15,000 to less than a 1000), and then attempted to set up a monopoly on the nutmeg trade.

The total monopoly stalled because the English managed to negotiate with the people on one of the islands and get them to accept English rule.

But I completely agree: the expected practice is that environmental standards are going to be brought down to the lowest common denominator, and that's one of the reasons why such a broad treaty as TTIP should be scrutinized thoroughly. In particular since it can lock us into the existing situation, since it's very easy to paint any environmental restriction as a ""protectionist, anti-business, anti-competitive"" measure that can be struck down based on the terms of the treaty.

Unless there's a player on a rampage, you never see anyone go completely out of control, not even UK with its sheer infinitely deep pockets.

But what really, really annoys me about it is that it becomes less and less fun as time progresses. Early game is great, seeing the inital investments in literacy and industry bear fruit is awesome, but once industry is going and the military becomes ever larger and more powerful, rebels become ever more plentiful and all colonies are colonized, it simply loses its charme. There is simply nothing left which can overcome these shortcomings, especially having to deal with these huge armies wedged into an entirely inadequate combat system is something which really turns me off. Among countless games I played, I only ever reached the end date once, and that was as an unciv. As a western power, I never got beyond the turn of the century. 

I think that making mechanics which work well at the start date, but do the early 20th century justice, is quite a big challenge. It's kinda like having the transition from central European late antiquity all the way to the early modern period in a single game, with a single set of rules and mechanics, but condensed into a span of 100 years.

Twain's known for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but not really for anything else. 

Poe is well known by anyone who has an interest in the horror genre, I'd say. Of the writers you referenced I'd say he was the best known and most popular and the one most likely to be read for pleasure, not just because it was part of a class.

Hawthorne - less so, maybe for the Scarlet Letter, but that isn't  well-known. 

Melville is known for Moby Dick, but that doesn't have anything like the interest or importance that it does in the American literary canon. 

Walt Whitman - much less well-known. I'm only vaguely aware that he was a poet and couldn't name anything by him.


Hard to recommend anything like Twain without knowing what books by him you like, but other 19th Century British authors that are well-read and regarded
