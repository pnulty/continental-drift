&gt; LONDON - Five members of a gang that trafficked people from eastern Europe to Britain and forced them to live in inhumane conditions while working to pay off fictional debts were sentenced by a British court on Monday.

&gt; The sentencing came days after Britain unveiled two multi-million pound funds to tackle modern slavery overseas and at home as part of a drive to end the crime described as a &amp;quot;Barbaric evil&amp;quot; by Prime Minister Theresa May. Prosecutors said the gang targeted vulnerable people in the Czech Republic who might not immediately be noticed as missing and trafficked them to the UK. &amp;quot;They were then treated as commodities to be used however the defendants saw fit,&amp;quot; prosecutor Ann Hampshire said in a statement.

&gt; Britain last year passed tough anti-slavery legislation introducing life sentences for traffickers and forcing companies to disclose what they are doing to make sure their supply chains are free from slavery.

I think that one of the main difference between U.S. cities and European cities is that in the U.S. you have *sim-city like* place with Housing districts, commercial districts etc... in Europe you still have *small shops* that are located in the place where people live. 
If you live in a town (big or small) or even in the center of a village, you have a high probability to find basic small shops usually a baker, a tobacco shop, a bar and a small grocery store within walking distance. Of course if you live in a farm in the countryside you need to take your car (or to be sportive and enjoy biking) to get some bread for the breakfast (It's a reality but not the *usual public* of european on reddit). 

Big supermarkets are less common so a car will often be useful (*not a must-have but a nice to have*) and if you're not living in a big town you'll need a car (or public transportation) for less common shopping. 

That said, in most of the European cities you can walk easily long distance and it's totally fine to walk 3 km to go shopping a sunny-sunday moreover we have decent public transportation (in Urban area) while in the U.S. there is a real lack of pedestrian infrastructure (like a sidewalk or a crossing) and crossing a 6 lanes street is an adventure, no wonder that people take their car to do 200 meters

Hillary could just be doing it to appeal to her liberal base or out of the fear of saying anything perceived as controversial during her campaign (like lets leave Assad alone and science also shows women are more prone to this kind of safety option which confirmed our observations).  Her history of actually backing violence intervention though tells another story of the girl who like to play toy soldiers for real that laughs at death so we can't be too sure.

Not when you put all the factors together and given since WW2 of build up... it might not be implausible. It's the fact that it's getting so distant in the memory that people are taking it less seriously. That can lead to it happening again. We need to take this seriously because all the same patterns are emerging and better safe than sorry. Syria and our insane obsession with Assad just isn't worth the risk.

In the short term. In the long term, who ends up on top? Capitalism despite its reach might also not have as much power as you think.

&gt; False. A black face on the front of Madden or FIFA is not political correctness. Why? Because lots of black people play american football and football. Lots of black people did not fight in the European theatre of WWI. That's why it's political correctness.

""Blacks stay in sports where you belong. We are not interested in your rarely discussed involvement or deaths in the war.""

&gt;That would also be political correctness because the majority of soldiers fighting in the European theatre in WWI were not of Turkish descent.

Why not? It's a story rarely told. I wouldn't mind.

&gt;It is political correctness. I already explained why it's political correctness. 1) The number of soldiers of African descent fighting in the European theatre (the main theatre) of WWI was very, very, very small. 2) The game developer themselves said it was a ""key goal"" to ""show diversity"". Rather than an accurate representation of the historical events.

Political Correctness to you = if it's anything but white it's poltiical correctness. Because telling a story about African Americans or German colonial soldiers in WW1 is just liberal media. I find that fascinating.

&gt;How do you think this feels to white people whose relatives fought and died in WWI? To see their memory defaced in the interest of political correctness? Or do you only show ""solidarity"" with a racial identity group when it's one that you've determined is the eternal victim in every single situation until the end of time?

How do you feel about black relatives whom fought and died in World War 1?

Are the white soldiers not being potrayed? You act as if all the characters and character models are black. Interesting.

There is a [war museum in Koblenz.](http://www.warmuseums.nl/gal/066gal.htm) which was captured by Patton's 3rd Army. [Here](http://www.tracesofevil.com/search/label/Koblenz) is a bit of an odd website contrasting Nazi era Koblenz during and now. 

Also a part of Rhineland-Palatinate is Remagen (and its bridge across the Rhine) where a major event in WWII occurred. Lots of ground fighting.

[Here](http://www.11tharmoreddivision.com/history/objective_nurburgring.htm) is a broad account of the fighting around Nurburg. Patton's tanks again... 

Basically, the whole region was a battleground in WWII, and lets face it, throughout european history. Relics are everywhere, and nowhere. Meaning the obvious ones were long ago policed up or found by those seeking souvenirs.

not unknown? A majority of figures from Greek myth, if their appearance is described, are blonde. It's not due to mixing with northern Europeans (who were semi-mythical non-entities to the ancient Greeks, called them ""hyperboreans""). You seem to think you only find blondes in Germanic peoples (I'm blonde, I'm not Germanic). You must not travel much, you can find blondes in *Turkey* easily enough. Blonde hair isn't like blue eyes btw, it's not all stemming from a single mutation. Though the mutation for blue eyes occurred very long ago and was spread around very wide very quickly.

&gt;milky-white peoples from Northern Europe

every character in Greek myth is described as white or ""white-armed"" at some point. Greeks are white, they just spend time in the sunlight.

&gt;one eye brown and the other blue

actually one blue and one ""dark as night"". Which could mean very dark brown or very dark blue. Apart from the heterochromia, nothing about Alexander's appearance was considered unusual. You're postulating that once ina a while a blonde Greek was born due to interbreeding with proto-Germanic populations generations ago (which is geographically not plausible at all). Not to mention societies didn't really *do* interbreeding back then, least of all Greeks who considered everyone who wasn't them ""barbarians"". Your whole assumption of swarthy Mediterraneans with dark hair and dark eyes is wrong. I already mentioned literature showing otherwise, pigment analysis of statues always shows blonde statues. Consider this fact, our word for the coloured part of the human eye comes from what the ancient Greeks called it – the iris. They got that word from their word for the *rainbow*, they had a goddess of rainbows who was accordingly named Iris.

&gt; Kraftwerk (""power plant"" in English) is an electronic band founded in 1970 in Düsseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as ""the godfathers of electronic music"". Kraftwerk's sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008.

&gt; Ralf Hütter (born 1946, Krefeld, Germany) and Florian Schneider (born 1947, Düsseldorf, Germany) met while they were studying improvised music in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1967 Ralf Hütter (organ), Florian Schneider (violin, flute), Basil Hammoudi (vocals), Butch Hauf (bass) and Fred Monics (drums) formed the group Organisation, released the album Tone Float and split shortly thereafter. The album features repetitive percussion and bass drum patterns embellished with guitar, flute, violin and organ. 

&gt; After disbanding Organisation, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider adopted the name Kraftwerk. Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970–1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians, most notably Andreas Hohmann (drums; 1970), Houschäng Néjadepour (guitar; 1970), Charly Weiss (drums; 1970/71), Eberhard Kranemann (cello, bass, hawaii-guitar; 1970/71), Klaus Röder (electric guitar, electronic violin; 1974), Michael Rother (guitar; 1970-71) and Klaus Dinger (drums; 1970-71). For a short period in 1970/71 Ralf Hütter left the band to complete his degree in architecture. There were some sessions/concerts with the line-up ""Schneider, Kranemann, Weiss"",  ""Schneider, Hohmann, Kranemann, Rother, Dinger"" and ""Schneider, Rother, Dinger"" in that time.  In 1971 Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk to form the band Neu!.

&gt; Their first three albums were more free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined strong structure of its later work. Their debut album, Kraftwerk, released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2, released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, electric organ, flute and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were then used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Connie Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums. Emil Schult has also collaborated on many releases, contributing both lyrics and graphics.

&gt; Live performances from 1972–73 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. In 1973, Wolfgang Flür (electronic percussion) joined the group.

&gt; With Ralf und Florian, released in 1973, the band began to move closer to its classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesisers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder, which would, in time, become one of its musical signatures. 

&gt; In 1974, they issued the fourth studio album, Autobahn. This critically acclaimed album marked Kraftwerk's breakthrough and established them as purveyors of electronic music. The title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. An edited version of ""Autobahn"" song reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and #11 in the UK.

&gt; In 1975, Karl Bartos (electronic percussion, live vibraphone, live keyboards) joined the band. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation is now regarded as the classic line-up of Kraftwerk, which remained in place until the late 80s.

&gt; In 1975, Kraftwerk released the concept album Radio-Activity (German version: Radio-Aktivität). The hyphenated album title displays Kraftwerk's typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. The title track ""Radioactivity"" was released as a single, and became a hit in France after it was used as the theme to a popular music show. This was the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by Hütter &amp; Schneider in their Kling Klang studio, and the first one to be performed by the classic line-up of Kraftwerk.

&gt; In 1977, Kraftwerk released the highly influential album, Trans-Europe Express. Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals. Two singles supported the album: ""Trans-Europe Express"" and ""Showroom Dummies"".

&gt; By the time of 1978's The Man-Machine (German version: Die Mensch-Maschine), Kraftwerk had created their own unmistakable brand of ""robot pop"". NME said of The Man-Machine: 'It is the only completely successful visual/aural fusion rock has produced so far"". Kraftwerk spent three years building their own Kling Klang studios in the late 70s, complete with, inevitably, scores of computers. The single ""The Model"", gave the band a surprise hit when it topped the UK charts in 1982.

&gt; In 1981 Kraftwerk released their eight studio album, Computer World (German version: Computerwelt). This album combined the use of the sequencer to create the sound now known as electro, inspiring the first producers in Detroit in creating techno, as well as innumerable other artists including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, and New Order, among many others. This album had the theme of computers taking over the world in the future. It was a commercial success, spawning the singles ""Pocket Calculator"", ""Computer World"" and ""Computer Love"". For this album, the band embarked on the massive Computer World world tour.

&gt; The EP Tour De France was issued in 1983. This song was featured in the film Breakdance and became the theme for the cycling event of the same name in that year. In 1986, the ninth studio album Electric Café was released. The album received mixed reviews. Two singles were issued from the album: ""Musique Non-Stop"" and ""The Telephone Call"".

&gt; In 1987 Wolfgang Flür departed and it was replaced by Fritz Hilpert. In 1991, Kraftwerk's best known songs were collected together and re-recorded on the compilation The Mix.

&gt; The single Expo 2000 released in December 1999 came as a surprise for Kraftwerk fans. A brand new song, although low key, sparked hopes of a new album. A video was released for this track, showing the band playing in wireframe suits, but no public appearances or interviews until 2003.

&gt; In 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks, its first album of new material since 1986's Electric Café. The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its original release date during the actual Tour. A completely new recording was made for the ""Tour De France"" track, based on the original 1983 arrangement.

&gt; In June 2005, Kraftwerk released Minimum-Maximum, their first official live album. It features two CDs and tracks recorded on their world tour during 2004, including concerts in Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Budapest, Tallinn, Riga, Tokyo and San Francisco. The band also released a live DVD.

&gt; Florian Schneider officially left the band in January 2009, though news of his departure was reported as early as April 2008. His place will be taken over by Stefan Pfaffe. 

&gt; In 2009, the band issued The Catalogue (German version: Der Katalog), a box-set comprising eight albums by Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums were digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album's original release.

&gt; Kraftwerk's influence has been incalculable. Hundreds of artists today in nearly every electronic music subgenres bear witness to their work. They are also reclusive, rarely giving interviews and making no media appearances.

Since we're all adults and realize that we have responsibilities outside of gaming, we don't expect our members to be professional gamers who are online 24/7. Although gaming is a hobby for us, we do have some knowledgeable players who will happily lend you a hand in your journey through Destiny.

Thanks and stay safe Guardians!


PS. Most of our clan mates are located in North America, but we however have a few of people from the UK, and would like to get more players from EU! Gamers from all timezones are welcome!


Please note We run a bit of everything. We plan our events and chilling parties using our forum (http://goodmorningwasteland.com/). We communicate on it constantly, that way new people aren't left behind, and new members don't become another face in the crowd! So register, post often, and you will be part of our Destiny family faster than you can say ""Senpai noticed me"".",False,0,Fireteams,,1,MoiraBrownCraterside,,t5_2zc5x

Louisiana remains French until the end of Napoleon's reign, when it is likely returned to Spain. The War of 1812 wouldn't occur, as there is no Madison to declare war on England. All the states would have minor, local wars over territorial disputes. New England would be relatively stable, and engage in trade with Europe, as they always had. The South will be fine for a time, but slavery will become such a burden that war/insurrections occur throughout the 19th century. Texas will not exist, as that was in large part a product of Manifest Destiny.

What's more interesting is Europe. The Napoleonic Wars still happened, which means most of 19th century Europe proceeds as we know it. Germany rises up under Bismarck, the Archduke is still assassinated in Sarajevo, and WWI begins. Here is where we see the true effects of no United States. The French and British only managed to repel the Germans after the Americans entered the war. With no Americans to the rescue, Paris falls in late 1917. 


With Russia having fallen to revolution, again as in OTL, the German Lebensraum is realized. The French are a shadow of their former selves, Germany is the dominant power of Europe, though England still rules the seas and retains much of it's colonial presence. French territory transfers to Germany and Austria-Hungary. 


WWII doesn't occur. The Soviets do modernize rapidly and attempt to retake the lost territory of Poland and Ukraine, but are no match for the combined German and Austrian forces.

What are you literally smoking? The way VR works is absolutely perfect for games that put you inside a vehicle so you're not forced to jump around in a room. Until we've got some Omni treadmill shit that's been popularized and priced into a reasonable state, VR isn't going to extend into most types of first-person immersion outside of when you're in a vehicle.

I bought Elite Dangerous, played it for two hours, then immediately ordered a flight stick and throttle for $140, something I would've never previously considered buying until I could look down and see those controls next to me.

And as of right now, I'm working on a plan to buy a ~$300 racing wheel almost entirely because I plan on using it for the truck simulator games and whatever other random driving things I get.

""Exception to the rule."" Please. I've got an entire galaxy, a few states, and most of Europe I can explore while building up cash and advancing to new vehicle/ships and experiences. That's a pretty big thing to ignore as being legitimate VR.

[See this article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/21/17-intelligence-agencies-russia-behind-hacking/92514592/) which contains the [following link](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national).

&gt; The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.

&gt; Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.

&gt; Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber “hygiene” scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.

the number of people who use sanskrit as a first language or frequently enough for daily communication is miniscule - of the order of several 10s of thousands (not counting the pujaris and such most of whom do not understand the head or tail about what they recite).

i think you are saying (correct me if i am wrong) sanskrit texts are irrelevant because so few people speak sanskrit anyway and so why bother about it. I care for sanskrit for 2 reasons. 

modern hinduism is a perversion of the highest and deepest philosophies that were part of indian culture and were primarily written in sanskrit. i sincerely hope that all those philosophies come back into the mainstream in india because people do a lot of crap and force others to do a lot of crap in the name of hinduism these days.

people generally believe that sanskrit literature is largely religious. that is not true. a lot of it is actually secular, mathematical or scientific. for example, a lot of work on infinite series (which forms the basis of calculus) was done at the kerala school of mathematics at least 200-300 years earlier than in europe. it is only a matter of speculation what one might find in all those untranslated texts.",False,0,india,,1,flying-ape,,t5_2qh1q

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/34fadbf4deb84d1983094ca09ea397b1.png)  

&gt; Volbeat is a heavy metal band from Denmark, founded in 2001. They released their first album, The Strength/the Sound/the Songs, in 2005 and the follow up, Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil, was released in Denmark on February 19, 2007, and in the rest of Europe on February 26, 2007. In March 2007, it topped the Danish album chart as the best selling album, the first metal album ever to do so.

&gt; Volbeat was formed in 2001 after frontman Michael Poulsen split up his former band, Dominus. Volbeat plays a fusion of heavy metal and rockabilly. They are inspired by the rock n' roll legends Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. No other Danish heavy rock band Volbeat has been able to get to position 18 at the Danish Top 100 for CD sales in over 10 years. This milestone was reached after their concert at the Roskilde Festival 2006.

&gt; Critics have generally been positive towards The Strength / The Sound / The Songs. The German hard rock magazine RockHard gave it 10/10 in a review.

&gt; Volbeat is also praised for its live performances. Their concert at Roskilde Festival 2006 received a 6/6 stars review in the Danish newspaper BT.

&gt; In week 8 of 2007, the record Rock The Rebel / Metal The Devil debuted as #1 in the Danish Top 40 for CD-sales and at the same time The Strength / The Sound / The Songs re-entered the chart at #21. Recently, the album achieved gold status for sales in Denmark.

&gt; Volbeat opened the Roskilde Festival in 2007. Volbeat also supported Metallica together with Mnemic at their concert on Denmark July 13 of that year.

&gt; More recently, Volbeat was announced to do a seven-date European spring tour and to support legendary speed metal act Megadeth in Finland and in their home town, Copenhagen. They have also already announced a few festival appearances for the summer 2008.

&gt; Volbeat has a large range of influences, which can be clearly heard in their music. On their official MySpace site Volbeat lists their influences in their own recognizable way:

&gt; ""Everything from Elvis Presley to Napalm Death .. hail: Johnny Cash, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Ramones, Social Distortion, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Dio, Megadeth, Metallica, Manic Street Preachers, Iron Maiden and bla bla bla bla...""

&gt; Volbeat's lyrics usually revolve around love, failed love or the power of a twisted mind. They thereby distance themselves from stereotypical heavy metal lyrics, although many of their most popular songs have very dark or sincere themes and plots.

&gt; Their first single was the cover version of Dusty Springfield's evergreen ""I Only Wanna Be With You"". The song doesn't differ much from the original with regard to the lyrics, but the accompanying music video is quite typical of Volbeat. In it, the band is seen with a classic microphone on top of a city roof.

&gt; Another popular feature of the band's lyrics are the returning ""series"" of songs. This is best represented with the songs ""Danny &amp; Lucy (11 pm)"" and ""Fire Song"" from The Strength/The Sound/The Songs followed by ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ness"" on Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil. The story is about the two desperate lovers, Danny and Lucy, who are killed in a car crash after Lucy runs away from her family.

&gt; ""Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ness, I'm so sorry to bring you this - We believe we found your girl in an old burning car way up the hill""

&gt; In the successor, ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ness"", Lucy's mother commits suicide and the father is suspected for the murder:

&gt; ""The old man is crying and he's lying - The blood on his hands' from his wife yeah""

&gt; The story is followed further by ""Mary Ann's Place"" from Guitar Gangsters &amp; Cadillac Blood, and was concluded with ""You Will Know"" off 2016's Seal the Deal &amp; Let's Boogie.

---

&gt;* A Swiss court has reopened an investigation of alleged espionage activities by agents of the government of Kazakhstan against a high-profile political exile living in Switzerland.

&gt;* In 2008, a chartered airplane carrying Khrapunov and his wife landed in Switzerland, reportedly with a millions of dollars in cash, fine jewelry and antiques onboard.

&gt;* The case was closed in March of this year, after Swiss authorities said they did not have enough evidence to confirm the precise identity of the perpetrators, two of whom were reportedly holders of British passports.

&gt;* On Monday, however, the Federal Criminal Court in the Swiss city of Bellinzona ordered that the case be reopened, after allegations by Khrapunov that the espionage against him continues.

&gt;* Kazakh authorities have been regularly accused by European governments of conducting aggressive espionage and intimidation operations targeting exiled adversaries of President Nazarbayev.

Then in the ""Spring"" of 2016 Big Money, Big Data buys in..

&gt; technology-focused private equity group Accel-KKR has acquired a stake in Cendyn, a provider of B2B technology for hotel marketing and event management.
The terms and amount of the growth equity investment were not disclosed. But the investment will support “a rapid expansion plan”, a Cendyn spokesperson told Tnooz.
Cendyn was founded in 1996 with sales and marketing tools for hotels that catered to the group business while also doing digital marketing to drive direct bookings. As the cloud software era developed, Cendyn adjusted course, but has broadly stayed within those categories.
The company has 373 employees today, but plans to scale up.
This year the Boca Raton, Florida-based company will add eight more offices in Europe and Asia-Pacific. (In November 2015, it opened an office in Singapore. It already had offices in London and Toronto.)

&gt;Can planets withdraw? Clearly the UK can withdraw from the EU, but a state can't withdraw from the United States without a civil war.

There was actually no formal mechanism for countries to withdraw from the EU [until 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union#Process), over fifty years after the organisation came into existence. Despite that, two countries (Greenland and Algeria, which both joined as territories of other members) were still [able to leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union) without an established formal process for doing so.

It's certainly true that there is currently no formal process for states to leave the United States, and the last time it was attempted there was of course a civil war as you note. That was, however, over 150 years ago.

We had a law that did just that for over 77 years. It's why throughout every recession in that time frame that the US banks came out worse than every other country, and slowed our recovery over other countries. It's why that no multifaceted bank in the US went under in 2008, but it was the single department banks.

 &gt;So does this one. Evidence: the ISP cartel.

Ah yes, ISP, so bad because you can only pick between a few. But, imagine if your ISP owned your bank, built your car, owned the lumber companies that built your house, and went as far to owning the farms that provide the food you eat. This happens in every other first world country, from Germany, to South Korea, to Japan. OMG!!!! It's so horrible that ISPs buy each other out, but other places the ISPs are just owned by companies that provide everything else.

&gt;So does this one, via military aid money to various other countries.

Umm, we don't actually subsidize our defense industries. Yes, we buy off of them, but in Europe, they not only give tax payer money to them to exist, but then buy off of them after. They are essentially double dipping. It would be like the US paying Boeing 40 billion dollars to build something that will cost 40bn to buy, and then we buy it for 40bn. So instead of what the US does where we just pay 40bn, places like Germany, the UK, Japan, will pay 80bn when it's all said and done.

&gt;We already do.

Not really. We specifically don't allow the corporate structure that allows it as much as other countries do. Keiretsu, and Chaebol are examples of what can't happen in the US, but are types of business structures that are government sanctioned there but not here.

&gt;Why not?

Yep, the VA is an executive branch department. Their management is the President. 

&gt;Never heard of that, so I can't comment.

It's another socialized healthcare system in the US, that provides even worse healthcare than the VA does.

&gt;Oh, please. The US isn't that special.

Well, seeing as we have the longest standing form of government, that's the only country to set foot on a celestial body outside of the earth, has 50 different states coming together and staying together, and somehow pretty much provide trade security to the entire world. I'd say it's in a pretty special position. 

&gt;Apples and oranges. Russia and Venezuela are incompetently-run, impoverished shitholes. The US has no such excuse.


But you said it works elsewhere. Why aren't you acknowledging it doesn't work in some other places? You think government run healthcare is the end all be all because it works elsewhere. But, it doesn't work in some other places. It's the same argument that you're making. You say that ""It works other places, we should do it"", without anything else.

t3_5af5og,1477991565,1481107315,d9glh4x,False,0,,t3_5af5og,"I think this situation has striking parallels with the onset of the Romanian Revolution in 1989.  From Wikipedia:

&gt;On the morning of 21 December Ceaușescu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timișoara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceaușescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now Piața Revoluției – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.[18]

&gt;In a speech laden with pro-socialist and Communist Party rhetoric, Ceaușescu delivered a litany of the achievements of the ""socialist revolution"" and Romanian ""multi-laterally developed socialist society"". He blamed the Timișoara uprising on ""fascist agitators"". However, Ceaușescu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceaușescu with cheers and applause. **About two minutes into the speech some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults at him, a reaction unthinkable for most of his rule.** Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting ""Ti-mi-șoa-ra! Ti-mi-șoa-ra!"", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceaușescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 100 lei per month (about 9 U.S. dollars at the time, yet a 5%–10% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.[18]

&gt;As Ceaușescu was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee building, sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of (what various sources have reported as) fireworks, bombs or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. Bullhorns then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a ""revolution"" was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration.

&gt;The entire speech was being broadcast live around Romania, and it is estimated that perhaps 76% of the nation was watching.  Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceaușescu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realized that something unusual was in progress. Ceaușescu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; **Ceaușescu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.**

&gt;The jeers and whistles soon erupted into a riot; the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timișoara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceaușescu slogans, which spread and became chants: ""Jos dictatorul!"" (""Down with the dictator""), ""Moarte criminalului!"" (**""Death to the criminal""**), ""Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!"" (""We are the People, down with the dictator""), ""Ceaușescu cine ești?/Criminal din Scornicești"" (**""Ceaușescu, who are you? A criminal from Scornicești""**).

&gt;Protesters eventually flooded the downtown area, from Piața Kogălniceanu to Piața Unirii, Piața Rosetti and Piața Romană. In one notable scene from the event, a young man waved a tricolor with the Communist coat of arms torn out of its center while perched on the statue of Mihai Viteazul on Boulevard Mihail Kogălniceanu in the University Square. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.

I am not using any kind of mods.

Because countries and people do in fact profit from it? As far as I remember EU citizens in the UK do in fact pay more in taxes than they get from the UK in health support etc. The UK does profit from them.

&gt; Democracy? Package deal? 

Yes. If you want to have a real democracy you have to have certain things. Free and equal elections. Basic rights. Etc. If you only take some of it, you can call it a democracy but it isn't one.

&gt; Why is there a tariff on those outside the union?

To protect the economic interest of those inside the union. For example there are anti-dumping tariffs on steel from China and Russia. That makes EU made steel more competitive in the EU. Now, if the UK leaves it will no longer profit from those tariffs.

&gt; Many of the policies seems to be contradictory in practice and directed at the specific purpose of political centralization

Politic centralization was from the begining something the EU was working towards. Although tariffs and free movement of people are not really part of that.

&gt; #Populism Is Not Fascism
&gt; 
&gt; ##But It Could Be a Harbinger
&gt; 
&gt; By Sheri Berman
&gt; 
&gt; As right-wing movements have mounted increasingly strong challenges to political establishments across Europe and North America, many commentators have drawn parallels to the rise of fascism during the 1920s and 1930s. Last year, a French court ruled that opponents of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front, had the right to call her a “fascist”—a right they have frequently exercised. This May, after Norbert Hofer, the leader of Austria’s Freedom Party, nearly won that country’s presidential election, The Guardian asked, “How can so many Austrians flirt with this barely disguised fascism?” And in an article that same month about the rise of Donald Trump, the Republican U.S. presidential candidate, the conservative columnist Robert Kagan warned, “This is how fascism comes to America.” “Fascist” has served as a generic term of political abuse for many decades, but for the first time in ages, mainstream observers are using it seriously to describe major politicians and parties.
&gt; 
&gt; Fascism is associated most closely with Europe between the world wars, when movements bearing this name took power in Italy and Germany and wreaked havoc in many other European countries. Although fascists differed from country to country, they shared a virulent opposition to democracy and liberalism, as well as a deep suspicion of capitalism. They also believed that the nation—often defined in religious or racial terms—represented the most important source of identity for all true citizens. And so they promised a revolution that would replace liberal democracy with a new type of political order devoted to nurturing a unified and purified nation under the guidance of a powerful leader.
&gt; 
&gt; Calling Le Pen, Trump, and other right-wing populists “fascists” obscures more than it clarifies.
Although today’s right-wing populists share some similarities with the interwar fascists, the differences are more significant. And more important, what today’s comparisons often fail to explain is how noxious politicians and parties grow into the type of revolutionary movements capable of fundamentally threatening democracy, as interwar fascism did. In order to understand this process, it is not nearly enough to examine the programs and appeal of right-wing extremist parties, the personalities of their politicians, or the inclinations of their supporters. Instead, one must carefully consider the broader political context. What turned fascists from marginal extremists into rulers of much of Europe was the failure of democratic elites and institutions to deal with the crises facing their societies during the interwar years. Despite real problems, the West today is confronting nowhere near the same type of breakdown it did in the 1930s. So calling Le Pen, Trump, and other right-wing populists “fascists” obscures more than it clarifies.
&gt; 
&gt; **THE BIRTH OF FASCISM**
&gt; 
&gt; Like many of today’s right-wing movements, fascism originated during a period of intense globalization. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, capitalism dramatically reshaped Western societies, destroying traditional communities, professions, and cultural norms. This was also a time of immense immigration. Peasants from rural areas, which had been decimated by new agricultural technologies and the inflow of cheap agricultural products, flocked to cities, and the citizens of poorer countries flocked to richer ones in search of better lives.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, as now, these changes frightened and angered many people, creating fertile ground for new politicians who claimed to have the answers. Prominent among these politicians were right-wing nationalists, who vowed to protect citizens from the pernicious influence of foreigners and markets. Fascist movements arose in almost all Western countries, from Argentina to Austria and from France to Finland. Fascists became disruptive forces in some countries and influenced policymaking in others, but they did not fundamentally challenge existing political orders before 1914. Their policies and appeal alone, in other words, did not make them truly dangerous or revolutionary. It would take World War I to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; That conflict killed, maimed, and traumatized millions of Europeans, and it physically and economically devastated much of the continent. “The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime,” British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey remarked at the beginning of the war. And indeed, by the time the war was over, an entire way of life had vanished.
&gt; 
&gt; The year 1918 brought an end to the war, but not to the suffering. Europe’s continental empires—Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian—­collapsed during or after the conflict, creating a variety of new states that lacked any experience with democracy and featured mixed populations that had little interest in living together. Meanwhile, in many of Europe’s older states, such as Germany and Spain, old regimes also collapsed, making way for democratic transitions. But like the new states, most of these countries also lacked experience with popular rule—and thus the habits, norms, and institutions necessary for making it work.
&gt; 
&gt; To make matters worse, the end of the war, rather than ushering in a period of peace and reconstruction, brought with it an unending stream of social and economic problems. New democracies struggled to reintegrate millions of soldiers back into society and reconstruct economies that had been distorted and disrupted by the fighting. Austria and Germany had to respond to the humiliation of a lost war and a punitive peace, and both were hit with hyperinflation. Across the continent, lawlessness and violence quickly became endemic as democratic governments lost control of the streets and parts of their territories. Italy suffered through almost two years of factory occupations, peasant land seizures, and armed conflicts between left- and right-wing militias. In Germany, the Weimar Republic faced violent left- and right-wing uprisings, forcing the government to send in troops to recapture cities and regions.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite these and other problems, fascists at first remained marginal forces. In Italy, they received almost no votes in the country’s first postwar election. And in Germany, Hitler’s 1923 Beer Hall Putsch flopped, ending with him and many of his coconspirators in jail. But as time passed, problems persisted. European economies had trouble getting back on their feet, and street brawls, assassinations, and other forms of social disorder continued to plague many European countries. By the late 1920s, in short, many Europeans’ faith in democracy had been badly shaken.",False,0,europe,ALDE,11,jtalin,EURO,t5_2qh4j

As for the topic on hand it seems to me that OP is complaining (correctly) about something but instead of taking one of the many options to overcome her apparent problem her real issue seems to be some kind of crusade of changing online society for the better. She seems to be somewhat ignorant of the fact that online communities in games like DotA are made up of a myriad of different cultures and social backgrounds that need to find common ground and that that common ground will not and can not neccessarily be as broad as one's personal societal expectations.

In other words, world wide internet communities are much more ""lowest common denominator"" than any of the societies of its participants. It is sad, but that is the way it has to be until we can all agree on more common ground - a change which has to come in the real world first.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we can expect society to change (even though not always to our wishes) but we should first realize what kind of society we are talking about. In DotA, cultural backgrounds differ greatly even on the same servers. US servers often host a lot of middle and south Americans, EU servers host a lot of Russians or other eastern Europeans which might not share ""EU values"" etc pp.

Also, we are talking about a community made up mostly of younger males. DotA was neither created nor ever greatly supported by a mass of middle-aged moms wearing soiled shirts while playing the game. It is a community created by and for young people of vastly different cultural backgrounds to compete, not to be nice and polite to each other all the time and celebrate diversity and the progress of human rights.

I did feel for OP when reading her first comment but reading everything she wrote here shows that she doesn't want to make her personal experience better. She wants to crusade to change that ""toxic"" DotA community for the ""better"" and does so by whining and trying to exploit sympathy - while completely ignoring the fact the user base of this game neither really shares her values nor her sensibilities and is made up mostly of people she neither respects nor wants to somehow compromise with.

Several renowned statisticians has been screaming about this since midsummer. On top of that you can add all the other fraud schemes and odd occurrences - An ocean of lost or fraudulent votes. 

* The corporate owned mass media (like CNN, NYT, MSNBC, WP, Reddit, Facebook) have been AstroTurf-ing Clinton as the favorite candidate since the beginning. They literally feature 100's of positively biased stories about Clinton for every 1 positive story about Trump. If you want to see how it works go visit r/politics!

""On ne peut pas"", ""tu ne peux pas"". En quoi une identité doit être unique ? 

Je me sens ""citoyen"" dans le sens de ""faisant part de"" : l'endroit de naissance de mon père (pas celui de ma mère, pourquoi, je ne sais pas, c'est comme ça). 

Je me sens ""citoyen"" dans le sens de ""faisant part de"" : le pays où je vis. Les décisions qui y sont prises me concernent, j'en parle la langue, je participe à la vie politique par mon droit de vote etc...

Je me sens ""citoyen"" dans le sens de ""faisant part de"" l'Europe, parce que je crois au projet Européen. Je pense que c'est intéressant de résoudre des problèmes par une collaboration pacifique plutôt que par des conflits humains. 

Je me sens ""citoyen du monde"" car faisant partie de l'humanité et considérant que un grand nombre de nos problèmes seraient résolus par des actions ou des collaborations communes et parceque je reconnais une humanité commune à tous. 

Là, je ne parle que de mon cas perso, je ne dis pas que j'ai raison par rapport à quelqu'un d'autre. Ce que je veux dire c'est que ces identités me paraissent complémentaires et non pas antinomiques. ",False,0,france,,1,Sivanar,,t5_2qhjz

""Hoje tive conhecimento de uma matéria veiculada pelo site da Revista Veja que inclui meu nome entre os apoiadores de um absurdo Projeto de Lei que prevê a incorporação dos rendimentos dos parlamentares, que tenham exercido no mínimo três mandatos consecutivos ou quatro intercalados, no caso de serem servidores públicos municipais. Eu não apoio o referido projeto e nem jamais apoiaria tal proposta absurda que só visa manter os altos privilégios do politicos, enquanto a população amarga desemprego, alta inflação e um forte ajuste economico. Esse projeto vai contra a minha história e meus principios. 
Em minha vida pública sempre me opus frontalmente contra os privilégios dos políticos e já me recusei a receber aposentadoria especial como deputado estadual (8 anos) e outra aposentadoria especial por ter ocupado por dois mandatos o cargo de Deputado Federal. Continuo me opondo categoricamente aos privilégios e benesses de uma casta de políticos que têm inúmeros benefícios à custa da população.
Nesse momento em que o governo federal ilegitimo do Michel Temer pretender fazer uma reforma da previdência que aumentará o tempo de serviço dos trabalhadores para que tenham o direito de se aposentar e ao mesmo tempo em que o governo de Dorneles parcela o salario dos servidores estaduais e fala até em redução salarial, seria um crime apoiar uma medida que beneficia os políticos, que já têm inúmeras regalias.
Infelizmente, eu e outros vereadores do PSOL fomos induzidos ao erro, quando levados a crer que esta seria uma medida para beneficiar os servidores municipais em geral, dada a redação do projeto. O projeto tem 35 autores e eu não sou um deles.

Remember, Germany had very valid concerns post-WWI about enemies on their border striking first as well. 

However, I'm not drawing a direct comparison because Russia lacks the popular ideological component that made Germany and the Soviet Union so dangerously expansionary. I agree that Russia has a vested, valid interest in maintaining Ukraine as a block to NATO's total influence. I think your Mexican analogy is very apt. 

I also think you're denying the fact that realpolitik holds (in most of its forms) that the natural condition of a state is to seek and consolidate power because states are in constant tension with each other. The United States does not have a vested interest due to immediate security concerns, but as the world's largest superpower and the possessor of most of its military strength, the United States serves as a doorstop to rapid and chaotic use of force between nations. We haven't had a major shooting war between two nations in close to 70 years primarily because the threat of US intervention is too great (I'm obviously not including many minor wars and the US' own invasions, but I wouldn't even classify Vietnam as a major war; the Korean War would be the last). This state of affairs not only prevents war, but also affords the US a historically-unprecedented level of geopolitical influence which is absolutely necessary for its continued existence. Allowing Ukraine to be annexed or controlled by Russia would be a sign to our European allies that we are no longer interested in maintaining our power in the region. This would lead to a break-up of trust in the US' ability and willingness to intervene in the case of small-scale conflict; nations who feel that tension with Russia may swing over to them in order to soothe tensions instead of risking empty posturing. This removal of the US' ""doorstop"" to expansionary foreign policy would destroy our political influence in the region and possibly lead to larger-scale conflicts breaking out. 

The US is the 900-pound gorilla sitting in the middle of the room surrounded by people who hate each other, but hate having their arms torn off even more. So they stay mostly polite and keep their voices down to avoid drawing the gorilla's ire; the illusion of peace and security is upheld as long as it's present. If the gorilla gets up and wanders out of the room one day, how long will the illusion of civility last? And why would anyone be willing to let the gorilla back into the room?

PS: It's unlikely that Ukraine will actually join NATO anytime soon; even with the increased tensions the EU is putting a potential join date 25 years into the future. This is why I'm positing that neither Russia nor NATO actually want the Ukraine to align with them; both would prefer it to be the canary in the coal mine, existing in a state of tension. That allows both sides to posture and fight over the Ukraine instead of fighting existentially for their own territory.

Goa for one was a Portuguese colony. We tried dealing with Portugal at the UN level but they refused unlike Hong Kong which had 100 year contract. There was an actual independence movement there since self rule wasn't even allowed unlike Crimea which was autonomous. 

Sikkim was a British protectorate which was handed over to India after independence. No one died in Sikkim (relatively bloodless compared to Crimea) when India annexed it. The region has various provisions that protect them, there is self rule. Most Indians aren't allowed to purchase land or settle there without special permission. What India did in Sikkim was subtle unlike Russia. There is no resistance movement. Hell, if we didn't annex it, China would have immediately, China did try to invade it twice and failed. 
You can compare Sikkim to Bhutan, India has not tried to annex Bhutan. Yes, we have a lot of influence on their dealing with China but the rest I believe they are mostly free to do as they want. A Bhutanese will have to correct me if I am wrong here. 

Whatever Russia's reasons to annex Crimea, there could have been a better way to handle it without the unnecessary loss of life. I do agree EU and U.S. Did meddle in that situation, how much? I don't know. What is certain that Putin did not handle it properly and gave Eu and U.S. More cards. 

IMO, it's best to stay out of it since it doesn't concern us. On the humanitarian question, Russia needs to ensure stability and end the violence.

&gt;**Bt Crop Yield**. Bt in maize and cotton from 1996 to 2015 contributed to a reduction in crop losses (closing the gap between actual yield and potential yield) under circumstances where targeted insect pests caused substantial damage to non-Bt varieties and synthetic chemicals could not provide practical control.

&gt;••Abundance and diversity of insects. In areas of the United States and China where adoption of either Bt maize or Bt cotton is high, some insect-pest populations are reduced regionally, benefiting both adopters and nonadopters of Bt crops. Some secondary (nontargeted) insect pests have increased in abundance, but there are only a few cases where the increase has posed an agronomic problem. Planting Bt crops tended to result in higher insect biodiversity than planting similar varieties without the Bt trait and using synthetic insecticides.

&gt;••Insecticide use. Application of synthetic insecticides to maize and cotton has decreased following the switch from non-Bt varieties to Bt varieties, and in some cases, the use of Bt crops has been associated with lower use of insecticides in non-Bt varieties of the crop and other crops in the same area.

&gt;••Insect resistance. Target insects have been slow to evolve resistance to Bt proteins when crops produced a high enough dose of Bt protein to kill insects with partial genetic resistance to the toxin and there were refuges where susceptible insects survived. Where resistance-management strategies were not followed, damaging levels of resistance evolved in some target insects.

____

&gt;**Herbicide-resistant crop yield**. Studies indicate that herbicide-resistant crops contribute to greater yield where weed control is improved because of the specific herbicides that can be used in conjunction with the herbicide-resistant crop.

&gt;••Herbicide use. Total kilograms of all types of herbicide applied per hectare of crop per year declined when herbicide-resistant crops were first adopted, but the decreases have not generally been sustained. However, total kilograms of herbicide applied per hectare is an uninformative metric for assessing changes in risks to the environment or to human health due to GE crops; because the environmental and health hazards of different herbicides vary, the relationship of kilograms of herbicide applied per hectare and risk is poor.

&gt;••Weed-species distribution. In locations where glyphosate is used extensively, weed species that are naturally less susceptible to that herbicide may populate a field. The committee found little evidence that agronomic harm had resulted from such shifts in weed species.

&gt;••Weed resistance. In many locations, some weeds have evolved resistance to glyphosate. Integrated weed-management approaches can be used to delay resistance, especially in cropping systems not yet exposed to continuous glyphosate applications. Further research is needed to improve strategies for management of resistance in weeds.

_______

&gt;**Social and Economic Effects**
At the farm level, soybean, cotton, and maize with GE herbicide-resistant or insect-resistant traits (or both) have generally had favorable economic outcomes for producers who have adopted these crops, but there is high heterogeneity in outcomes. The utility of a GE variety to a specific farm system depends on the fit of the GE characteristic and the genetics of the variety to the farm environment and the quality and cost of the GE seeds. In some situations in which farmers have adopted GE crops without identifiable economic benefits, increases in management flexibility and other considerations may be driving adoption of GE crops, especially those with herbicide resistance.

&gt;The cost of GE seed may limit the adoption of GE crops by resource-poor smallholders. In most situations, the differential cost between GE and non-GE seed is a small fraction of total costs of production, although it may constitute a financial constraint because of limited access to credit. In addition, small-scale farmers may face a financial risk when purchasing a GE seed upfront if the crop fails.

&gt;The committee heard diverse opinions on the ability of GE crops to affect food security in the future. GE crops, like other technological advances in agriculture, are not able by themselves to address fully the wide variety of complex challenges that face smallholders. Such issues as soil fertility, integrated pest management, market development, storage, and extension services all need to be addressed to improve crop productivity, decrease post-harvest losses, and increase food security. Even if a GE crop may improve productivity or nutritional quality, its ability to benefit intended stakeholders will depend on the social and economic contexts in which the technology is developed and diffused.

En résumé : c'est complexe, c'est parfois positif, parfois neutre, rarement négatif. C'est une solution parmi d'autres. Les effets sur le consommateurs étant inexistant (*No pattern of differences was found among countries in specific health problems after the introduction of GE foods in the 1990s*) c'est un choix qui incombe aux agriculteurs, de même que le choix du tracteurs qu'ils souhaitent utiliser (pas besoin d'une société civil qui souhaiterait bannir pour des raisons X/Y/Z fausse les John Deer). Personne ne forces les agriculteurs à cultiver des semences GM (ni même à dépendre des semences commercialisés par les semenciers comme voudrait le faire croire certain). Ces derniers étant ceux qui sont sur le terrain c'est bien à eux je pense de choisir d'en utiliser ou non (le contrôle s'il y en a besoin c'est limiter l'apparition en particulier des adventices qui tolèrent le glyphosate – problème pas encore grave qui est apparu avec les cultures GM, et que de façon pragmatique les agriculteurs chercherons à limiter si ça devient un problème).

Edit : et pour rappel la promesse des plantes GM pour l'instant c'est protéger les rendements en diminuant la quantité de produits phytosanitaires. Autrement dit l'agriculteur paye des semences GM plus chère mais en contre partie fait des économies sur les dits produits et est gagnant à la fin. Il n'existe aucune plante GM (pour l'instant en tout cas) dont le but est d'augmenter les rendements de la plante elle même, que ça soit les rendements en huile/grain/paille/etc. ou dont le but est de permettre aux plantes une meilleure utilisation de la matière du sol (en particulier azote et phosphore, qui permettrait de façon similaire aux plantes GM actuelles de maintenir les rendements en diminuant les intrants). 

Je rappelle aussi a/ on est au tout début de leurs utilisations, b/ d'autres outils assez prometteurs commencent à être mit en place (en particulier de *genome editing*, voir CRISPR), c/ personne n'en parle mais une nouvelle méthode appelée la sélection génomique commence à être utilisée en sélection et est très prometteuse, d/ les outils d'imagerie, d'informatique et de robotisation arrivent également et sont très prometteurs, et e/ la réglementation actuelle est tellement coûteuse (sans aucune raison valable) que la majorité des semenciers n'ont pas envie d'investir dedans (sauf les plus gros qui sont les seuls à le pouvoir, et qui forcément en arrive à des statues de quasi monopole).

&gt; The Trump Organization also has dealings in Russia and Ukraine, and officials with the company have repeatedly stated they want to develop projects there. The company is connected to a controversial Russian figure, Vladimir Potanin, a billionaire with interests in mining, metals, banking and real estate. He was a host of the Russian version of The Apprentice (called Candidate), and Trump, through the Trump Organization, served as the show’s executive producer. Potanin is deeply tied to the Russian government and obtained much of his wealth in the 1990s through what was called the loans-for-shares program, part of an effort by Moscow to privatize state properties through auction. Those sales were rigged: Insiders with political connections were the biggest beneficiaries.

&gt; Manafort is not the only Trump adviser to quit over Russian links. Carter Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker and adviser to Russian state energy company Gazprom, was named by Trump as a foreign policy adviser. Following an intelligence briefing about allegations Page conducted private talks with Russian officials about lifting sanctions if Trump were president, Senate minority leader Harry Reid demanded an FBI investigation. Page later resigned.

&gt; At least two alumni of the Bayrock-Trump partnership have gone on to work directly with the Khrapunovs.

&gt; One is Daniel Ridloff, whose LinkedIn profile says he worked for Bayrock for five years until 2010, then spent eight months in “acquisitions and finance” at the Trump Organisation. The other is Felix Sater, a Russian-born convicted fraudster and FBI informant with mob connections who was number two at Bayrock until 2008. On his LinkedIn profile, Mr Sater says he spent 2010 working at the Trump Organisation as “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump”. Mr Ridloff did not respond to a request for comment; Mr Sater declined to comment.

The 50c party is out in full force. China has done absolutely nothing to indicate they're cleaning up. Sure, they're building solar panels and wind power farms, but that doesn't come remotely close to offsetting *everything else* they do to muck up their local and even global environment. 

For starters, [China outputs more C02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions) annually **than the U.S, European Union and India COMBINED**. Think about that for a moment, you take the U.S's annual C02 output, all of Europe's, and throw in India's for good measure, and China still puts more out. China is not one to talk about the global environment. Their C02 output effects every single one of us. It's an amount that has a huge impact for the entire earth. Sometimes you'll see the Chinese nationalists rush in to quote per capita nonsense (*But they have 1 billion people!*) and to that I say, so does India. You don't see them needing to pump out that much C02. Per capita is entirely irrelevant anyways. This isn't a competition; do you think the environment cares how many citizens a country has? (*""Oh, I guess I won't raise the global average temp by 1 degree because per capita...*"") Raw totals are what matter here. Especially when talking about these amounts.


&gt; These plans aren't just fancy words in China - they actually are completed.

Well, excluding the first part of comment where I talk about how they're the biggest C02 producer, yeah. They are just fancy words. 
People forget, China has an incredibly effective PR/Propaganda wing. They'll literally say anything to get in the news when it's beneficial to them. I remember back in 2003 they announced a joint mission to Mars with Russia by 2012. Yeah, that never materialized. China has a habit of talking the talk, but not walking the walk. In fact, I can't think of a single big bold claim they've made in the last 10-15 years that has come to fruitation and actually happened. 

Another thing; China has laws on the books that are as strict as, and sometimes even more strict than the U.S when it comes to the environment. The problem is they don't enforce them. Or when someone does come to enforce them, an exchange of cash takes place. China is a [very corrupt country](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results) relative to most western countries. I doubt people realize just how much until they actually live there for a bit. I have lived in China and I don't trust a single thing their government says. If they said the sky was blue, I would seriously think there's some sort of catch. ",False,0,worldnews,,-8,buzzkillpop,,t5_2qh13

Anyway here's what most catches by ear/eye for the week ending Tuesday November 1:

PICKS OF THE WEEK:

* To Green Angel Tower: Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, Book 3 By Tad Williams, Narrated By Andrew Wincott -- This! Actually! Includes! Both parts of what is usually released in two parts both in print and audio, the US release FINALLY of the concluding book of Tad's decade- and genre-definiting epic fantasy series. 63 hours for one credit, people. You've got enough time to read (or re-read for the first time in years) before Tad's long-awaited return to Osten Ard next year.

* The Weaver By Emmi Itäranta, Narrated By Aysha Kala for Harper -- ""The author of the critically acclaimed Memory of Water returns with this literary ecological tale in the vein of Ursula K. Le Guin and Sheri S. Tepper, in which an innocent young woman becomes entangled in a web of ancient secrets and deadly lies that lie at the dark center of her prosperous island world.""

* Fallen Dragon By Peter F. Hamilton, Narrated By John Lee for Tantor -- ""In the distant future, corporations have become sustainable communities with their own militaries, and corporate goals have essentially replaced political ideology. On a youthful, rebellious impulse, Lawrence joined the military of a corporation that he now recognizes to be ruthless and exploitative. His only hope for escape is to earn enough money to buy his place in a better corporation. When his platoon is sent to a distant colony to quell a local resistance effort, it seems like a stroke of amazing fortune, and Lawrence plans to rob the colony of their fabled gemstone, the Fallen Dragon, to get the money he needs.""

* The Chimes by Anna Smaill, narrated by Luke Kempner for Quercus -- Debut novel from this New Zealand writer which literally *just* won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel: ""After the end of a brutal civil war, London is divided, with slums standing next to a walled city of elites. Monk-like masters are selected for special schooling and shut away for decades, learning to write beautiful compositions for the chimes, played citywide morning and night, to mute memory and keep the citizens trapped in ignorance. A young orphan named Simon arrives in London with nothing but the vague sense of a half-forgotten promise to locate someone. What he finds is a new family - a gang of scavengers that patrols the underbelly of the city looking for valuable metal to sell. Drawn in by an enigmatic and charismatic leader, a blind young man named Lucien with a gift for song, Simon forgets entirely what originally brought him to the place he has now made his home.""

* Willful Child: Wrath of Betty: Willful Child, Book 2 By Steven Erikson, Narrated By MacLeod Andrews -- Legendary epic fantasist Erikson (Malazan Book of the Fallen) returns to his dark humor sci-fi series.

* The White City By Simon Morden, Narrated By Thomas Judd for Orion, Book 2 of ""Down"" after 2016's *Down Station* -- ""Since escaping London's inferno, Mary and Dalip have fought monsters and won - though in the magical world of Down, the most frightening monsters come from within. Now they hold the greatest of treasures: maps that reveal the way to the White City, where they can find the answers they're looking for and learn the secrets of Down. But to get there they must rely on Crows, who has already betrayed them at every turn.""

* Shadowed Souls By Jim Butcher - editor, Kerrie L. Hughes - editor, Narrated By Jim Butcher, Julia Whelan, Various -- Series: The Dresden Files, Book 14.5 -- Can't get enough Dresden? Here's a shared world anthology for you.

* **Teen:** The Diabolic By S. J. Kincaid, Narrated By Candace Thaxton -- ""Red Queen meets The Hunger Games in this epic novel about what happens when the galaxy's most deadly weapon masquerades as a senator's daughter and a hostage of the galactic court.""

* **Fiction:** All That Man Is By David Szalay, Narrated By Sean Barrett, Mark Meadows, Huw Parmenter -- A Man Booker Prize finalist this year: ""Nine men. Each of them at a different stage in life, each of them away from home, and each of them striving - in the suburbs of Prague, in an overdeveloped Alpine village, beside a Belgian motorway, in a dingy Cyprus hotel - to understand what it means to be alive here and now. Tracing a dramatic arc from the spring of youth to the winter of old age, the ostensibly separate narratives of All That Man Is aggregate into a picture of a single shared existence, a picture that interrogates the state of modern manhood while bringing to life, unforgettably, the physical and emotional terrain of an increasingly globalized Europe. And so these nine lives form an ingenious and new kind of novel in which David Szalay expertly plots a dark predicament for the 21st-century man.""

* **Fiction:** Faithful: A Novel By Alice Hoffman, Narrated By Amber Tamblyn -- ""Growing up on Long Island, Shelby Richmond is an ordinary girl until one night an extraordinary tragedy changes her fate. Her best friend's future is destroyed in an accident while Shelby walks away with the burden of guilt.""

* **Teen fiction:** The Sun Is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, read by a full cast -- ""I'm a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I'm definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is 12 hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won't be my story.""

INDIE PICKS:

* Uriel's Fall: Ubiquity, Book 1 By Loralie Hall, Narrated By Leanna Abbott for Crossroad Press -- ""What's a corporate demon to do when the voice in her head is devouring her sanity from the inside out, and the hosts of heaven and hell would rather see her destroyed than surrender a power no one should possess?""

* Surrender the Sun by A R. Shaw, narrated by Kevin Pierce -- ""In the year 2030 the Maunder Minimum, a period of solar inactivity, will cause a mini-ice age like it did between the years 1645 and 1710. When it does, Bishop will have to save her not only from the effects of severe weather but also from man himself.""

* Wild and Wishful, Dark and Dreaming: The Worlds of Alethea Kontis By Alethea Kontis, Narrated By Alethea Kontis and Kate Baker

* Code Breakers: Alpha By Colin F. Barnes, Narrated By Marc Vietor for Audible -- No, Audible's not an indie audiobook publisher by any means, but! Barnes is published by tiny micro ""Binary Books"" and the [Kindle edition](http://amzn.to/2fdqkmh) has often been free or (as it is today) $0.99, making this an incredibly inexpensive Whispersync pickup ($1.99 add-on price). Code Breakers: Beta, Code Breakers: Gamma, and Code Breakers: Delta are also all released this week (with tiny Whispersync deal prices) along with the aptly named prequel Code Breakers: Prequel.

* Rune of the Apprentice by Jamison Stone, narrated by Kevin T. Collins for Audible -- ""In a world where magic, technology, and nature have merged, the few who can control Runes hold dominance over all of creation. All believe that Aleksi, a 16-year-old orphan, was blessed to be born with a Rune embedded in his palm, but that's only because they don't know the truth - Aleksi's Rune is so powerful it's killing him.""

Gcbro replied of course, why wouldn't we? And that's when ubpmom let them know I don't allow ubpdmom to travel with me, even if we take the same flight. (This is because I had a lifetime of bad travel experiences [two trips a year annually to visit extended family growing up] but it culminated in a horrible experience I had with her traveling to Europe. She flips out and screams at airline attendants if our flight is late or cancelled which makes me uncomfortable. She repeatedly aggravates me on the flight itself even after polite warnings. She also refuses to let me drive the rental car in any circumstances and only sets ""our itinerary"" to her liking. She refuses to let me drive (at 30) even though she gets disoriented the moment she enters a roundabout. This has resulted in many a near collision and angry drivers honking at her/us. In Europe she got stuck going around two round abouts on a toll road getting tolled 9 times at 11euro a pop. She was screaming and crying the whole time and would not pull over, screaming that she 'can't' despite the large shoulder with other cars parked.  She did all of this in front of company in the same car. She also refused to learn any of the language of the country we were in (even hello or thank you, just barked commands in English) which the citizens of this country find particularly disrespectful. After we left eventually the car rental company tried to say first she damaged the car, then tried to say it was totaled resulting in a 3 year foreign court battle (there was no damage to the car, it was a scam). I could go on and on. I reaped an emotional toll from that trip for years.)

So now I make my way to the airport, get on the plane and sit separate, then we make our own arrangements to wherever we're going [separate car rental, hotel, etc]). It's better for my sanity this way even if were both going to the same family's wedding, but of course ubpdmom doesn't understand.

Antenna was up when ubpdmom made this statement to SIL, and you're right, it is mocking and disrespectful. SIL had asked ubpdmom why I made those 'rules' and ubpdmom replied with that line. I wasn't present.

As I say in the original post there's a large number of different factions who the Leave campaign appeased by not having a coherent position. But whenever I point out obvious stuff like this then it's the worst thing ever. 

E.g There were factions of racists who voted Leave and some racist rhetoric deployed by the campaign (e.g Breaking point, muslim migration etc, let alone what was on the internet. **and** there were also a lot of Commonwealth Immigrants who the former group hates. But the campaign said ""let's strengthen links with the common wealth!"" Them taking it as increasing commonwealth migration. That's deluded on the part of both of these two groups, and fundamentally contradictory at the level of the whole campaign. Hence why I say it's better breaking it down into interests of various groups than this ""Whippets and Top hats"" level of Class based analysis. 


As said If anyone dares to suggest that not everyone who voted leave is isn't a political scholar politely addressing a perceived over-reach of EU federalism and sovereignty or that the Leave campaign wasn't a bit post-factey then instantly a horde of people jump down your throat as ""STOP CALLING EVERYONE WHO VOTED RACIST!"".

Ok so maybe you say, this won't happen in your patriotic system, because in this system nobody does trade with any neighbour everybody exists just as a completely isolated economic island, where nothing is ever imported and everything is created in-country. 

Well so strong patriotic sovreign country builds a factory on one of their pretty rivers and hey, if it's your factory, you'll just dump all the waste products into the river, because hey, it's your factory and your river and nobody is gonna fuck with you, and tell you what to do, you are a proud patriotic independent nation, dammit! 

So that neighbour on the other side of the river suddenly sees that HIS river is totally fully of this and says, nobody is gonna fuck with then, and fuck up your river which brings water to your people, you are a proud patriotic independent nation, dammit! 

People argue about these kind of things even NOW in this supposedly not as patriotic environment. And you really think you can avoid serious conflict between nations in your scenario? 

That doesn't mean that the EU ever will be or should be just a blind hodgepodge. But it's debatable that this is what it is, that it will ever be that or that a lot of people are concretely plotting towards it. But some form of conflict negotiations and rules ARE necessary to deal with conflict and yes interlocked trade really does help prevent conflicts from escalating and yes the EU doing away with strict borders and ensuring free travel for potentially disputed regions IS helping.

&gt; And for the record, Romania is corrupt as well.

Romania is also fighting corruption and is experiencing massive economic growth. Romania is projected to overcome Russia on a GDP/capita basis in just a few years, which has literally never ever happened before, ever. That's why Putin needs to drum up nationalism and fear of the West, that's why he is waging his information war, because he can't win over facts, so he has to distort reality so that the average Russian has something to rally behind(him, as the protector of traditional values and of the Russian people against the aggressive West) rather than quickly realizing that pretty much every country that has went the way of the EU with its liberal democracy is going to be living much better lives than they are. I mean that's what it boils down to. Russia cannot under no circumstances ever admit that liberal democracy might actually be better than their brand of nationalist-authoritarianism, nor can they ever let people know that the EU is in fact a success and not some curse.

&gt; How does the corruption argument always come up? People in Russia know the government is corrupt, people in China know the government is corrupt, it is not an explanation for why Putin took Crimea.

I think you have a hard time understand the scales of corruption we are talking about, since you're probably not from around the area. Russia is the most naturally wealthy country on Earth, the interests are huge for the handful of people that have direct control over Russia's vast wealth. Putin rode on the wave of the oil boom in order to gain popularity and trust in the early 2000's, without actually making Russia's economy more modern and competitive with the exception of very few fields like military. It's much simpler to control a nation when you control by far it's biggest source of wealth then it is to control a nation with a modern and very diversified economy. Problem is that being so dependent on resources may have its benefits for the very small elite that control it, but all it generates is corruption and shitty lives for every day people, furthermore, being so dependent on things such as oil means that when the price crashes, an economic crisis is quick to follow, further decreasing the quality of life for the average citizen. 

People aren't very happy under such circumstances, so what Putin has decided is to compensate in other areas, thus even though corruption is absolutely through the roof in Russia and the economy is doing very poorly, people becoming poorer day after day, Putin still manages to retain popularity because he drums up fear, fear of the West, fear of NATO, fear of gays, you name it. He then wraps it up with a nice ribbon called nationalism, panders to the nostalgia that people feel over times long gone, and voila, even though Putin and his buddies are corrupt as fuck politicians that have siphoned off dozens of billions of dollars, none of that really matters anymore when you have to deal with evil NATO encroaching upon your borders and wanting to destroy your way of life through gayification/multiculturalism/liberalism/whatever the fuck else with Putin being the only true leader capable of saving you.",False,0,worldnews,,4,Frostxtq,,t5_2qh13

Also - your sources discredit each other.

&gt;Indoor cats may live between 12 and 15 years of average.

&gt;A pet that spends more time outdoors may live on average 2 to 3 years less than a cat that lives exclusively indoors. In addition, unexpected accidents may end an outdoor cat's life at any time.

The second one says:

to roam outdoors often don't live to see age five

Again this just reinforces that I'd need to see better sources to get an accurate idea of the true life expectancy difference.

Japan had seven outbreaks between 1850 and 1902 - 200,000 dead in Tokyo alone.  1854- 5.5% of Chicago dead.  1853-54 - 11,000 dead in London.  1854-55 - 236,000 dead in Spain.  1863-75 - 30,000 dead in Mecca.  1865-70 - 70,000 dead in Africa.  1866 - 90,000 dead in Russia.  1866 - 165,000 dead in the Austrian Empire.  1867 - 113,000 dead in Italy and 80,000 dead in Algeria.  1866-73 - over 50,000 dead in America as the disease spread further along the Mississippi and the tributaries.  1883-87 - 250,00 dead in Europe and another 50,000 dead in America.  1892 - 268,000 dead in Russia, 120,00 dead in Spain, 90,000 dead in Japan, 60,000 dead in Persia, 58,000 dead in Egypt, 9,000 dead in Hamburg.

I **try** to be as precise with my calories as I can. Most fast food places, at least here in the EU, have the macros/calories on the menu. And if I REALLY want or can't avoid having something that doesn't declare its calories/macros, I ballpark it based on the ingredients and try to err on the high end of the caloric estimate and slightly lower on the macro estimate, just so I make sure that I'm more careful with the rest of the day. For example, the burger I had like half an hour ago I estimated to be around 900 calories based on the ingredients and the calories of the closest similar burger that has a macro/calorie declaration, like something from McDonalds. And for dinner I'll have half a kilo of the baked chicken breast that I mentioned with some salad and end the day at some 1700kcal, 160ish grams of protein, 50ish grams of fat and the rest in carbs, which I don't care about that much. But, I'll also have some psyllium seed husks in water for fiber, a multivitamin and a few omega3 caps every day - to ensure good digestion and plug any little micronutrient holes that I might have over the day.

As for fat sources, it's pretty varied. Sometimes it's fatty fish (salmon), sometimes fatty meat (pork, beef, poultry with the skin), sometimes fatty cheese. I don't obsess about these things. I just try to keep fat between 40 and 60 grams over the day.

I'm 5'11"", 177 lbs (80.5 kg) and around 12% bf, cutting down to around 10.

So to explain WHY Japan became the empire that is was in OTL you need to understand how the end of the Tokugawa period and the transition to the Meiji period.

Japan kept isolated for most of the period of exploration and the surge of imperialism and watched from a distance as the European powers started to devour mainland Asia. For the sake of keeping this simple and concise lets focus on China (a watered down history of China really). So as you should know there were a few wars in China known as the Opium wars which saw Britain steamroll the native Chinese government (twice) over trade disputes. Putting it simply, Britain absolutely ruined China and held control with an iron fist as well as opening up areas for other foreign powers to lord over via trade (France, Russia, US, etc.). China became a puppet and was plagued by drug use, primarily opium (as the name implies) which had a huge effect on the population, opium is an opiate, addictive, and makes users feel lethargic, if you're a hardcore opium user you're not going to be up to do much work while high and the only thing you can focus on while sober is getting high.

Being the observant neighbor Japan was, this scared the shit out of them. The once great China was reduced to a humiliated, addicted mess kept under the thumb of western powers. What really pushed Japan over the edge and away from the Tokugawa Shogunate was the intervention of the United States and the iconic arrival of Matthew Perry and his ""Black Ships"". Of course Japan had no chance against the US Navy who quite literally sailed into Tokyo bay and sat there until Japan signed away their ports or to put it a little more colorfully ""Fuck you, let us in"".

This is the domino that started the chain reaction, a number of internal elements saw the Tokugawa Regime, which wasn't exactly as popular as it was back during Ieyasu's time, was now seen as a weak leader and the thought of being subjected to the same humiliation as China was unacceptable. Fast forward some time and the government was put under the leadership of the young Emperor Meiji who took the segmented feudal collection of islands that was Japan and turned it into a modern, unified, state ready to compete on the world stage. Changes to the way the country worked, such as removed the caste system (to an extent) and working to modernize all aspects of life to mirror the west, primarily Bismarck's Germany, which was the target of affection for a select number of Japans top reformers. 

Now lets flash forward to the 1900's. Japan is now modernized, a ""western"" nation nested in the far east, a few wars under their belt gained them the respect (or fear) of the West, especially the victories that were the Russo-Japanese wars. The thing that really pushed Japan towards an expansionist agenda onto the main land and out into the pacific islands, besides wanting to be a modern western super-empire, was a need for supplies. Japan being as big as the US' east coast, is not a very resource rich country, or at least for the resources one would need to create and maintain a strong fleet of modern battle ships. 

This is where I am going to deviate to your alternative timeline and put forth two different options, well call it ""Diplo"" and ""Expansion"". The diplo route sees Japan stop expanding their borders after a few pacific island expansions. Let's say Japan is roughly where it is now  (Kyushu, Hokkaido, Okinawa, Honshu, Ryukyu, Okinawa, etc.) and also still holds more of the Sakhalin islands than the do currently due to settlements made during the Russo Japanese war. Japan, exhausted with war, settles into closer diplomatic ties with allies who hold some form of influence in Asia such as England, the Dutch, Portuguese, the United States, France. If they facilitate trade with these countries they would be able to hold a steady supply of materials to maintain their modernizing pace though many of these same nations would most likely try to find a way to keep a foot up on Japan whether it is a one sided trade deal or a military base agreement, etc. But lets say Japan manages to secure close ties with these countries, they would still be an ally during World War I and lets also say they stay with these nations during World War II. 

The United States would not have been drawn into the war fully as early as OTL without pearl harbor, possibly at all. Asian stays relatively peaceful except for the issue of the Maoists not having to halt their revolution to focus on stopping the Japanese invasion, this may mean Chang Kai Shek is able to maintain power due to being able to focus his forces agaisnt the communists or drawing on American allies more fully without the US fighting Japan. China does not fall to the communists, the Korean war ends with the communist loss (No China, no support from the north for Kim Il Sung) and Ho Chi Minh manages less influence for a communist uprising. 

Without the occupation of Japan after WWII no base at Okinawa is set up, the United States doesn't act as the Pacific police force quite as much as OTL, though they still hold influence in a number of governments as the Cold War still swings into action though Europe stays as the primary focus without Communist China in the East. 

Japan in this scenario would most likely continue to be a major Asian power but without the destruction of its economy, industrial centers, and major cities it wouldn't be quite the same as today (Allied firebombing of cities prompted modernization of buildings, etc.)

Option 2: Japan stops after the occupation of Manchuria and Formosa. Skipping forward to save on rambling Japan relies less on the west for supplies thanks to being able to rely more on the natural resources in Manchukuo. This puts China on edge with Japan but without further fighting the Communist revolution is still similar to option 1,   the Kuomintang may still lose after their defeat in the north, China falls to Communism, and Chang Kai Shek is unable to occupy Taiwan due to the Japanese Occupation. China is the only China, no POC/ROC debate, China is China. Their communist influence follows through the same way that OTL does, We get two Korea's, Two Vietnam's become one. But Japan did not continue to try and expand, never allied with the Axis and as such WWII does not spread into Asia further than the Soviet/German front.

Where this becomes complicated is that without WWII the occupation of Japan does not happen but with more natural resources Japan doesn't need to rely on the west for trade quite as much in the ""diplo"" timeline meaning a US - Japan pro-capitalism alliance may not happen. Of course a USSR - Japan alliance might be less likely as the White Russian's who fled during the rise of the Soviet Union may still try to pull favor in Harbin, the monarchical Japan may be swayed enough to oppose the communists in Asia leading to a western alliance anyway. 

So in my opinion if Japan did not become a belligerent in WWII they most likely would have stayed a western ally and a primary power in east Asia along with the British empire. Not as close with the US as OTL but not exactly far away for the safety that is a super power ally.

It is more profitable for cargo companies to load up on more freight than fuel, and then just refuel and do a crew change in ANC. The airport is home to fairly large FedEX and UPS hubs. The freight itself does not leave the plane, aside from things destined for Alaska.

I did find it intriguing as it does not outright deny that the kid were taken but denies the coercion involved. Importantly (and why I commented more on this point) it incorrectly paints those aborigines wishing to assimilate as the totality of the group and tries to make a dichotomy of either assimilation or ""segregation"" as if the totality of the aborigines people only had one option which they should be forced to choose from and from whence they can never return.

But it also believes that taking kids away from aboriginal culture and raising them as only white is not ""(stealing them) from their mothers in order to bring them up as Europeans and to breed out the Aboriginal race"" but instead ""the right-liberal, assimilationist attitude to Aborigines...not (about) preserving ethnicity, but adherence to a set of universal liberal values"".

My point is fairly simple - Parliament gets to decide. Sometimes they decide to let other supernational bodies impose laws in the name of co-operation and common good. What they shouldn't do is let the populist flavour of the month dictate policy. 

Plus, the idea of a referendum being democratic is fairly laughable. One person/one vote devolves in to a tyranny of the majority, as we've seen with the increasingly frantic calls for a ""Hard Brexit"". This is what a parliamentary democracy is for.

Most of the big sports are hosted in north america except soccer, so for the most part they are scheduled to make it easy for people in NA to watch. Which gives sports bars live events on their TVs consistently during times when people would drink and be merry.    

Bigger gaming tournaments might be held all over the world and they are scheduled for prime time viewing in the country they are hosted in. Which makes it challenging to watch live if the event is hosted in Europe, but near impossible to watch live if hosted in southern Asia.  
  
So for those events you would be watching replays and would need a dedicated group of patrons that would make the effort to watch as a group on a delay, so it would take time if it happened at all. Its cool to have a success full bar and have a group of guys watch a replay of darts on one of your TVs, but its hard to build a business solely on that type of patron.  
  
the other big thing is a lot of people naturally say oh man **if I could play games and drink beer that would be great!**   
 
The problem is liquor licensing in BC and a few people have touched on it already.  
Most restaurants get a food primary license cause its faster and costs about $475 (75% cheaper than a liquor primary licence), problem is you can't get one if the idea of your games bar is not food first, the idea behind a food primary licence is a restaurant that also happens to sell booze.  
  
Now if you want a games/E-Sport bar in the ""traditional"" sense you are looking at a very fine line, you would need a Liquor Primary license which takes 7-12 months to get, costs $2,200, and you would need to avoid at all costs coming off as an arcade. The BC liquor branch specifically says on the site that arcades can not get Liquor licences (cause arcades are a business that is directed at minors, ya ya that's dumb I know but its how it is).  
  
those were the big start up issues that I could think of that seemed like massive hurdles, outside of the regular ones you have with starting a restaurant. As much as people might like the idea of an E-Sports bar the timing of major gaming events if held outside of NA, and BC's liquor laws make it harder to succeed, since you can't just make an adult arcade with booze that also shows E-Sports, You need to be an E-Sports restaurant and Bar that has a couple games too, but that's **if** you wanted to serve booze.  
  
now if you don't serve booze and make it like Interactivity (The Board Game Cafe), no booze, snack foods, retail space with the addition of a viewing lounge/ E-Sports on TVs on the walls that might work much better/ have less of a hindrance to start up. you would loose the Sports Bar feel, but you would open up to a broader age of patrons since you could have minors come in with all their disposable income, and not just a niche of adults that want to drink beer and watch Twitch Streams.",False,0,VictoriaBC,,2,minikyle,,t5_2rbsy

A bit annoying is, that you probably won't be able to get permanent citizenship (in the EU) if you just come here to work. In case you're from a country that is deemed insecure you could theoretically apply for refuge. I think however, that this would be a worse option because you won't be allowed to work until your refuge status is accepted which can take months or even more than a year due to the current refugee crisis and it's still not guaranteed, that even if it's accepted that you will be allowed to stay for more than a few years. Since you aren't persecuted and your life isn't in danger in your current country, it's very likely that your application will be rejected anyways.

So if you want to come, then first finding work and then getting a working permit seems the best option.

A new study from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, to be published on Wednesday, says that signing a free-trade agreement with the EU will not recoup any loss in services exports, but would reduce the long-term fall in goods exports from between 58-65 per cent to between 35-44 per cent.

Advocates of the UK leaving the single market say that signing FTAs would enable British exporters to access markets in the EU and the rest of the world.

The study was based on the average FTA in existence in rich economies and big emerging markets, while Theresa May, the prime minister, has said Britain is aiming for a unique deal with the EU.

In theory, the falls in exports could be reduced if Britain managed to sign a deep bilateral agreement with the EU, including good coverage of the services sector. But Monique Ebell, the author of the report, said: “The average FTA for services at the moment is not very comprehensive and tends not to do very much.”

In 2014, 40 per cent of Britain’s services trade, and 56 per cent of its goods trade, was with other European Economic Area members, meaning that the overall fall in British exports would be 24 per cent for services and 20-25 per cent for goods.

Britain’s post-Brexit trade arrangements have come sharply into focus over the past few days after the government scrambled to reassure Nissan, which manufactures cars in Sunderland, that its ability to export to Europe would not be affected by leaving the EU.

One solution would be to sign an FTA with the EU that pegged import tariffs at zero and aimed to expedite customs and regulatory procedures that add to the costs of cross-border trade.

Ms Ebell said more research was needed to assess which of the many aspects of the single market — including freedom of movement for capital and labour, harmonised regulation and rules against state aid — were instrumental in creating so much trade between EEA economies.

“We need to understand very quickly in a deep way what will matter in an FTA,” she said. “An off-the-shelf agreement based on current practice is not going to be much use.”

Economists have focused on “passporting” — the right for financial services companies to operate throughout the EU under UK supervision — as one issue likely to affect Britain in particular. But services FTAs tend to have weak coverage for financial services, falling well short of the automatic market access afforded by passporting.

The British government has yet definitively to announce whether it wants to remain a member of the single market and the customs union, which sets a common external goods tariff and would sharply constrain Britain’s ability to sign FTAs with non-EU countries.

So you wrongly assumed that I am referring to America's sins with the goal of equating them to Russia's, or to stop your reference to Russia's sins. That is untrue. I repeat again, I am merely putting forward what I believe follows logically when we examine issues like geopolitics. In this case, that is: if we are looking at how bad the Soviet Union was (which is, according to what you say -- correctly, let me say -- is the reason why the Eastern Europeans joined NATO) how can we also look at the alliance into which they had joined and not shiver? This is not ""whataboutism"". 

Let me put forward an analogy:  Mr. A is a rich corrupt businessman giving an interview with a reporter. During the interview, he is asked about corruption and how to fight it. He goes on to explain how it's important to fight corruption, and particularly points to Mr. B for being excessively corrupt. In great detail Mr. A explains how corrupt Mr. B is, and everyone is shocked.

Now, I think most people will agree that it is highly hypocritical for Mr. A to discuss so much about Mr. B's corruption while pretending like his own is non-existent. I also think that, to question him of his corruption *as he is going on about Mr. B's corruption* is completely legitimate and valid. It should not be constituted as ""whataboutism"" at all, unless one's purpose is to ignore Mr. B's corruption, which is really no different from the stunt that Mr. A is trying to pull to begin with -- mainly, the ignorance of one's corruption.",False,0,worldnews,,1,Thucydides1987,,t5_2qh13

""Em sua decisão, o juiz afirmou que o Judiciário não pode mais absorver os conflitos ""negados pela postura antidemocrática dos demais poderes, sob o manto protetor de qualquer instituto jurídico"", como a posse, sob o risco de ser responsável pela repressão transmitida pelos administradores. O juiz afirmou que o risco em caso de desocupação à força com o uso da Tropa de Choque da Polícia Militar é muito grande e mostra “a tradição marcadamente autoritária da sociedade brasileira e de suas instituições”.

Segundo Adriano Laroca, sem reconhecer os conflitos sociais ou de interesses, as instituições optam pela repressão e desmoralização do interlocutor. No caso da ocupação da USP, continua, a reitoria não mostrou qualquer disposição de negociar com os estudantes, professores e servidores sobre temas relevantes à própria qualidade do ensino. Para o juiz, a ocupação de bem público como forma de luta democrática só deixa de ser legítima quando o ônus à sociedade é maior do que o bônus.""",False,0,brasil,,1,personalpostsaccount,,t5_2qh9i

You can't just dismiss the hate campaign he has been battling from day one like it's nothing. The press in this country are hugely powerful, just look at what they did with the brexit debate. It is a large part of the fact that his policies are popular until they are attached to him, a clear sign the less informed think anything corbyn must be bad. It's because from the get go his views have been skewed and character assassinated. No earlier briefings or rapidly formed friendships with hostile journalists will change that. 

I wish labours press team/he would respond to smears and misinformation directly and quickly but I can understand why it isn't happening.

This would also rhyme with [this anecdote] (http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1240&amp;recType=story):

&gt; Romanian criminals in Italy have followed a similar path to those from Albania. They arrived in massive numbers in the late 1990s and started performing the crimes that Italians no longer wanted to do. These included high risk and visible crimes such as prostitution and larceny. [...] Nicoli [Second Department of the Central Operative Service in the Italian Police] says that many criminal organizations from the Balkans have a background that can include military training, and a **readiness to use violence**. [...] **This was not a Romanian Roma group. Nicoli has never seen Roma groups involved in structured or organised crime in Italy**.

&gt; In the Turin example, he says there is a full tree of a military organisation with a figurehead and a second line of command. [...] The robbers were recruited from Romanian orphanages and, according to prosecutor Giuseppe Creazzo, were trained in robbery in an “academy of crime”.

&gt; The press has stated these men belong to “a paramilitary group of over 300 men trained to pull off robberies across Europe” [...] This credit card fraud has a high incidence rate, but peaked a few years ago. These are **criminals who move around a lot, because they do not want to draw attention. But they are not Roma**.

I do agree that the article could have been written much clearer (and with links to the data as well). But leaning back once the first emotionally pleasing hypothesis can be constructed is not good form either. 
The linked article by the way also mentions the Roma issue in a few unsatisfying lines. 

The general gist would also rhyme with the rumors I heard about Romanian criminal bands in Germany. Those were generally not mixed up with the ""Zigeuner"". The Romanians (following the Albanians) were usually seen as the most problematic, particularly in rural areas.

t1_d9h4r1l,1478027780,1481123598,d9h8ezt,False,0,,t3_5abfz0,"One of the salient features of the Soviet planned economy that is easy to overlook was that it was big. The Soviet economy operated as a near monopoly on all ends of the productive process. There were always nooks and crannies to find resources and squirrel away excess materials. This reserve capacity gave Soviet managers enough latitude to make meet their quotas, and as /u/Smilin_Dave correctly notes, barely exceed their targets. 

Accessing this reserve was easier said than done. Obviously, maintaining reserves of materials was illegal by the state, but this was a violation of the law that was honored more in breech than practice. Industrial managers often operated in an incredibly complex web of bartering and under the counter transfer of material from other concerns. This too was also illegal, but often necessary to make the system run. One peculiar element of the Soviet economic system was the *tolkach* (pusher), an individual with connections and knowledge of the system. *Tolkachi* would sometime balance the needs of several firms at once with strategically placed bribes or other gifts, all the while employed at a sinecure or other paper title. Although the *tolkachi* were very much creatures of the Stalinist era, they were a persistent factor within the Soviet economy through 1991. There was constant harping about bribery in the Soviet press and periodic anti-*tolkach* campaigns. 

But maintaining a *tolkach*'s services was a necessary evil for Soviet factory managers as these sort of grey market methods were needed to meet quotas. The Kosygin reforms actually enabled this by *khozraschet* system of self-accounting. This allowed managers greater leeway to allocate resources within their charge with the expectation they would meet, or exceed, their production targets. This method of accounting had been pioneered in the NEP period of the 1920s and had fallen into disuse after the 1930s. The Kosygin reforms' reintroduction of *khozraschet* shifted a degree of localized power onto the managers. In theory, the *khozraschet* system introduced a level of accountability and incentives in the Brezhnev era, but practice showed that it helped enable some of the chronic problems of the stagnated Brezhnev economy. 

These various methods all allowed the Soviet planned economy to function, but not at the growth rates of the earlier postwar periods. Soviet consumers had unparalleled access to amenities like cars, televisions, and other consumer luxuries in the 1970s, showing that at least the system sort of functioned,  but access to these goods lagged far behind the West and the gap was growing. More dangerously for the USSR, the Brezhnev era started to rely more upon fossil fuel sales to Western Europe as a revenue stream to make up for shortcomings in the domestic economy. As oil and natural gas prices fell in the 1980s, this revenue stream dried up, making the problems of dysfunctional Soviet economy more acute.

The RAF, RIAF, RAAF, RNZAF, RN, RIN, RAN and RNZN contributed heavily to the air and naval campaigns that held back Japanese naval and air power, and in many cases destroyed, crippled or otherwise distracted major Japanese air and naval formations, making the US island hopping campaign easier.

Britain (and Commonwealth troops) took North Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Crete and Corsica alone, and for most of the Italian Campaign, the number of Polish soldiers outnumbered the amount of US soldiers sent to fight in Italy. The only time this changed was towards the end of the Italian campaign when the US started to ramp up its presence in Europe due to the US getting its advantage over the Japanese in the Pacific, which mean the US didnt need to keep as many troops in that theatre any longer.

As Churchill said, the US only surpassed the UK in dedication to the war effort in WW2 on 6th June 1944. D-Day. And even then, British troops alone took two of the beaches, and Canadian troops, supported by Free French, Polish, Free Belgian and Free Dutch forces took a third. Royal Marines also supported the US assault on Utah beach, and 95-97% of the naval assets used on D-Day came from the Royal Navy. And ALL the landing craft came from the Royal Navy, and were manned by British sailors. The US only took two beaches, and one of them it nearly fucked up through incompetance.

And even then, the US had an easier time in Western France than the British and Commonwealth troops did in Eastern France. The US speedily moved around Western France taking major cities, resource hubs and other points of interest as there wasnt much German resistance outside of garrison forces stationed in ports and cities.

The British and Commonwealth troops though had to fight a dozen SS divisions (a mixture of elite armoured divisions, mechanised infantry divisions and Motorised infantry divisions) alongside at least the same amount of non-SS Wehrmacht divisions. This led to British troops fighting larger and more bloody battles and taking less ground. In fact, the fighting was so fierce that casualty rates for BOTH sides on most occasions matched and in many cases surpassed the casualty rates of the bloodiest battles in WW1.

Visas are given to non-citizen migrant workers, refugees are allowed to work by being eligible for refugee status in the US. The US' Visa program is also too strict and doesn't account for nearly the amount of people who are trying to find work, hence why there's so many undocumented workers. The reduction on availability has, rather than reduced migrant workers, just encouraged them to bring their families and stay over as undocumented. 

I'd say the US' immigrant policy is too strict and backwards in a lot of way too, but Germany's is far worse in that sense. Germany not being exceptional doesn't change that, and it's something a lot of countries are just going to have to stomach. You can't be part of the global market and practice isolationism at the same time. 

&gt;all those nice things the migrants wanted from Germany like security and infrastructure come as a result of a regulated economy with balanced citizen productivity and privileges

So let me get this straight, the solution is to compound the problem from barring people from finding work? Better to pay a stipend monthly and have the state provide, rather than allow them the opportunity to become a productive and citizen of this infrastructure?

Yeah, that's very clearly backwards. If the problem is the strain on the country, then let these people work! You have the good fortune of not having to raise them up as children, immigrants are generally harder workers than the local populace, and are clearly willing. It is absolutely ridiculous to then turn around, blame them for being a drain on resources, while also not allowing them to contribute to their own income so the state doesn't have to. 

&gt;You can't just chuck millions more people into the equation

A 1% population increase isn't going to offset things so heavily either. Again, the US manages, and while it doesn't get as many refugees it has plenty of undocumented immigrants. They're, more often than not, beneficial. You make them out to be a problem economically, when the biggest problem is Germany's strict laws. 

Germany has also signed and ratified (IIRC) the UN declaration of human rights which says everyone has a right to work.

Oblivion and Skyrim are similar games, though. Both of them share levelling, but Oblivion has more RPG elements, such as character creation, the class system, weapon durability, and the like. The enemies are more generic European fantasy, and there are Daedric quests, but they require you to find the Daedric shrines rather than have someone walk up to you and start the quest for you. There is a Fighters Guild, an Imperially charted organization with the intention of training mercenaries, instead of the Companions, and the Mages Guild, an Imperially charted organization with the intention of using magic for the benefit of the Empire. The Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood are in both games. The main difference between Skyrim and Oblivion that I noticed is race; Skyrim is obviously incredibly Nordic, but Cyrodiil is incredibly cosmopolitan, with different cities mirroring the different provinces; Cheydinhal for Morrowind, Bruma for Skyrim, Leyawiin for Black Marsh and Elsweyr, etc. The races are all more or less treated completely equally, as racism isn't as extreme in the heartland of the Empire.

The difference between Morrowind and Skyrim is extreme. There are many more factions in Morrowind than in Skyrim, with three combat factions, four stealth factions, and four magic factions, as opposed to only one. Morrowind also uses the RNG for almost everything; your potions have a chance to fail, weapons have a chance to miss, spells have a chance to fail, lockpicking is determined randomly, speechcraft is determined randomly, etc. It's a true classical RPG; if you're not trained in a particular skill, you will *suck* at that skill. Race-wise, there is definitely bigotry in Morrowind, seeing as it is the home of the Dark Elves, and there isn't a Daedric quest for every single Prince. Fast travel also doesn't exist, but teleportation spells do.

They are all very different games, and they are all very good.

t1_d9gpwib,1478029419,1481124303,d9h9u7q,False,0,,t3_59oobt,"&gt; Yes. Before guns, the big weapons were pikes (long pointy sticks), big cavalry (men with pointy sticks on horses) and bows (long range pointy sticks). Before pikes was spears (pointy sticks). Swords were a backup weapon for if your pointy stick broke. Catapults were only for when you reached a castle. Armor protected you from pointy sticks. The colosseum was for entertainment, and guess what: a lot of the people inside fought with pointy sticks. Even after gunpowder, for years the most frightening weapon on the battlefield was the bayonet, which turned your gun into a pointy stick. Pointy sticks were the main weapons of war for most of human history.
&gt; 

I'm sorry, but this is just insane. Hell, you even mentioned castles, which were incredible fortresses that themselves required architecture that nobody in the sub-saharan could produce.

&gt; You said that the residual effects of segregation and slavery would be mocked. Are you saying that the residual effects of segregation and slavery included no discrimination somehow? I mean, that's the biggest, most obvious effect I can see. Hell, segregation WAS discrimination writ large. And here you are saying that discrimination is a big thing!

Residual effects of slavery and segregation are that blacks are a protected group, that blacks have affirmative action and other racial preference advantages, that blacks can't be portrayed negatively in the media without it causing a shitstorm, etc. They are all positive, which is why Western blacks are the most well off and educated blacks found anywhere in the entire world. It is the *opposite* of discrimination. It's whites bending over backwards to help them and giving them so much help that it would be nearly impossible for them not to do significantly better than whites, if not for racial differences in intelligence.

&gt; ""Not progressive enough"" doesn't describe Ramzpaul. Just in case you missed what does describe him... ""Well, if all it takes to get fired from your job is insulting single moms, the supreme court, advocating secession, hanging out with Nazis and cheering on terrorists... "" Well, attitudes like that make it hard for me to want to hire him for any position where he may deal with single moms, the police, the military, any minority, refugees especially, and cheering on terrorists kinda is a catchall for stupid. Are you still going to hang this on the SPLC being unfair? I'd say he got what he deserved.

How is anything you just listed, other than the terrorism thing which is satire - ramzpaul is a satirist, any different from ""not being progressive enough"" ?


&gt; Who did they lose it to? 

Europeans who then treated them incredibly for the most part. We gave them back land, we give them racial advantages in hiring and college and what not, we don't collect property taxes from them, etc. We also give them access to our science, technology, law enforcement, etc. It's an unprecedented level of kindness from one race to another. 

&gt; I think I showed that you didn't do anything nice.

No, you just showed that we don't get credit for it. Nobody here is saying whites get credit for their good deeds. 

&gt; So, after a hundred plus years of shit, they have had 20 of decent. With a big pile of white nationalists, white supremacists, neoNazis, and other assorted assholes doing their best to fuck them up even now. And you want to claim they have had the opposite of discrimination...

White nationalists and neo-nazis are tiny in number and even smaller in institutional power. White supremacists probably don't exist at all. So yes, the opposite of discrimination. 

Interesting how you point out teeny tiny insignificant parts of the population and cite them as mega-discrimination, but leave out the blatant institutional advantages blacks get.

Each location will have a specific kind of wireless router with a limited subset of MAC addresses.

To me, this is the whole point.  There is no 'one way or the highway'.  Someone should be encourage to find what works for them, and then they are no longer suffering.

This is the ultimate goal/aim for me:  that ALL options are presented and openly discussed with the aim of helping the sufferer to stop suffering.  The more people get help with their drinking problems, the better.

And to that aim, I feel that all posters should be free to be discuss what worked for them, and what may help others, on an open forum such as this subreddit so that people can then look further into them as they wish.  Remember that TSM isn't a 'kooky-found-on-the-internet' thing.  It is an approved medical treatment across Europe.  Whether people agree or disagree with the treatment, or whether they wish to call it recovery, or not, is, in my mind, irrelevant.  The fact is that knowledge and experiences of this method are being discriminated against on this subreddit (in a previous thread, the mod u/seanomen told informed us that we were no longer welcome to discuss TSM on this subreddit and must refer people to a different subreddit, despite a subreddit rule saying 'Disagreement and debate and alternative opinions are welcome, but rudeness is never appropriate' and 'This subreddit is for people struggling with addiction and working on sobriety.'  My position on this was never clarified by him, but I simply asked that if we were to be following this particular rule he wanted in place, then why weren't those wishing to suggest AA as a treatment method being asked to defer people to r/alcoholicsanonymous?

There IS clearly bias on this subreddit against those who have not found success with traditional treatment methods.  I do not believe that is right and I do not think it is productive or helpful to those coming here asking for help, many of which are multiple relapsers.

By reducing his drinking from 60 drinks to 4 drinks a week, u/Wolfie12345 is clearly working on achieving sobriety.  He may reach zero next week and then stay at zero and never drink again.  Because he is then sober, is he then allowed to post here without being downvoted?  Will he be allowed to discuss what worked for him without the backlash?

My request to have the not-for-profit TSM website reinstated on the sidebar Programs Of Recovery was declined by the mods because the website has a 'donate' button on it.  I politely pointed out to them that that shouldn't be a valid reason for declining the request because almost every single other link there also has a donate button on their website, too.  Hell, even the AA link in that sidebar has a 'contributions' link on it where AA members can contribute/donate online.  As does the LifeRing link etc.  If we cannot have our official, not for profit and approved website linked there for this reason, the why have all the links with donate buttons not had their sites removed?

Sadly, I never heard back from the mods again.  This conversation happened in August this year, and I again requested a conversation with a mod last month about it.  Nothing but silence I am afraid.

That exclusion to a not-for-profit site providing regulation-approved information about this approved method could directly lead to someone suffering much longer than they need to.  I am not anti-traditional treatment.  I am pro-choice. People visiting this subreddit are being withheld information that MIGHT help them to lead a more productive and eventually alcohol-free life.

I highly suggest going with RES if you can. The suites have a kitchenette and a shared kitchen you can use to cook whenever you want.

False consciousness?

For all the cultural sensitivity and moral relativism displayed by academia toward brown people, IME with historians I see ~~precious little~~ none at all exhibited toward European history in the New World.  During and after the time North American was colonized, conquest was the order of the day *everywhere*.  Not just among Europeas. Good grief, Ottoman jihadis were laying siege to Vienna in the 1680s and when the US banned slave importation in 1807, the Sokoto Caliphate had barely got off the ground.  Don't get me started on the bloody mess that Asia was long before Europeans were anything but visitors. 

Nor were the Mesoamericans e.g. DeSoto encountered exactly peace-loving; they slaughtered tens of thousands *of their own people* each year.  In fact, the reason the ""conquistadores"" conquered was because other people in the region were sick to death of getting slaughtered by the Aztecs, and joined with the Spanish ""invaders"" to put an end to it all.

Couple things I've learned (more of a process including these steps

 1. Centering is the most important part. if there's un-evenness in the piece or wall, you're just going to bring that un-evenness up. (this can be useful if you keep  on cutting the top off, where the un-evenness shows [since you've brought up the un-even parts], but it wastes a lot of clay.


2. Making the hole where you're going to put your fingers. Some people use needles to start the hole (or fingers), but it takes practice as it can get out of control. Instead  Use the wooden knife tool something like this bad boy [here the one on top](http://f.tqn.com/y/pottery/1/S/6/-/-/-/modeler.jpg) to slowly go down the center.

as for the actual pulling up (there should be a doughnut like shape. ) I think the most I've learned is if you're doing a pull, keep that amount of pressure constant (tapering off a bit towards the top. Don't be afraid to follow through on a pull up even if you fail/it feels weird. and just remember outside hand puts pressure under inside hand to go out, and vice versa to go in.

Let me back up. Maybe I should've elaborated on your last post.

&gt;He doesn't need to win a full out war... He just needs to invade a couple of territories, defend them, and then negotiate to keep what he grabbed when the war winds down.

This is exactly *why* Putin won't risk a full-on war with the West. He can't win, it'll crush his economy, and possibly cause instability in Russia. So why would he do that when he can use force selectively (Eastern Ukraine, South Ossetia) and focus more on interfering in internal politics of other countries? It's cheaper and more effective, and carries less risk, than open war. From OP's article:

&gt;""That Russia is pulling for Trump is at this point beyond any dispute,"" New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait writes. ""Putin’s Russia has been proven or credibly alleged to have boosted friendly candidates in France, Germany, Austria, and, most successfully, in the election of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine. Something like this seems to be happening in the American presidential election now.""

Trump saying he would recognize the obviously bullshit Crimean plebiscite is going to encourage more of this behavior. This is *exactly* what Putin wants an American presidential candidate to say. He wants to weaken NATO specifically so he can expand without opposition in Eastern Europe.

What a coincidence, I just so happen to be a college engineering student (aerospace engineering at UAH) and I can tell you with certainty that stealth shaping and stealth technology is nowhere near that straightforward. The only people that think RCS reduction and aircraft design are that simple are people who are a lot less well-informed than they think they are. Designing aircraft is hard. Literally nothing about it is truly straightforward.

There's a big difference between two aircraft looking similar (such as the F-CK-1 and T-50) and one being a copy of another once you know what to look for. Fighter jets, even 5th gen fighters, vary wildly in appearance depending on their specific roles and their era. There is no single ideal ""shape"" that can be assigned to a fighter jet. What you need to ask is ""does this design make sense for this fighter's intended role?"". This question is the big difference between convergent design and a stolen design. If the design makes sense for the role, then it's probably just convergent design, however if it doesn't make much sense, then it's probably stolen. The J-20 falls into the latter category. The J-20 is a stealth fighter that's probably geared towards being an air-supeiority fighter/interceptor, much like the F-22. The requirements for this role is generally high speed, negative stability, and long range along with high stealth. A canard-delta wing layout, which is what the J-20 uses, is good for many of those things. This is why we see that layout used a lot in European fighters. However I see two big problems here: the canard-delta wing layout isn't a stealthy one, and the J-20's canards are *massive*. 

The canard-delta layout would make sense if the J-20 were built as a 4th gen fighter, where it doesn't have to worry about stealth, however it just doesn't make sense for a 5th gen fighter. Canards, especially ones as large as the J-20's, reflect radar like hell. Plus, it has stability problems in the yaw axis, which requires larger vertical tail surfaces which also reflect radar. It's an inherent design flaw that nobody's really thought of a solution to. It seems like China's idea was to cover the canards with a heavy RAM coating to reduce radar return, but I highly doubt that would truly solve the problem. If I were an engineer tasked with designing a fighter from scratch to match the F-22, a canard-delta layout is not the wing layout I'd choose. You can get the exact same aerodynamic performance from a traditional layout with none of the stealth and complexity problems that come with it. There's a reason why the J-20 is the only 5th gen fighter that uses this layout. The AMCA, F-22, and T-50 are all made for the same roles as the J-20, and all feature similar (theoretically in the AMCA's case) or superior performance to the J-20, but none of them feature canards.

In the end, the J-20's basic design makes no sense for a stealth air-superiority fighter. However it would make sense if they started with a 4.5 gen design made to go up against the F-22 (MiG-1.44) and decided to modernize and stealthify the design so that it was ""good enough"". This would explain how the J-20's dimensions and general shape are very similar to the MiG-1.44's, and its relatively fast development process compared to other 5th gen fighters, as it's all built on the proven designs of other countries. The same applies to the J-31, which is undeniably based on the F-35C. I have nothing personal against China or Chengdu, I love the look of the J-10B and the (redesigned) J-31, however it's naive to think that they aren't conducting industrial espionage on a massive scale.",False,0,MilitaryPorn,,7,8Bitsblu,,t5_2sq9y

While we did wake up after that and reply, I thought that in general, our attack looked disjointed and rigid relative to how we have been playing. There was less movement off the ball and we lacked width. This was even more obvious as our crossing and set pieces (Ozil come on mate your delivery was poor) were sub par.

Elizabeth and her council left more information that give a good sense of their priorities, but much of what happened outside the court is difficult to discern. 

The protestants in England wanted Elizabeth to support the Huguenot cause in France, which Elizabeth attempted to do in 1562-1563 (though Elizabeth was probably as motivated to recapture Calais as support the French Protestants). The result was a crushing defeat for England, and made Elizabeth less willing to intervene in French affairs (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 66-67). 

The major international concern for most Catholics and Protestants in the early years of Elizabeth’s reign was the succession of the thrown. Since Elizabeth was the last surviving child of Henry VIII, should she die without an heir, the crown would pass to her cousin Mary, Queen of Scotland. This Mary was granddaughter of Henry’s older sister, and though only 16 years old, was a committed Catholic. This remained a major concern for Protestants in England, despite Mary’s removal from the throne in 1567. Mary remained a threat to the church in England until her execution in 1587. All the concern over the religious wars on the continent tended to take second place to domestic concerns, and to the succession of the English crown (Alford, *Early Elizabethan Polity*, especially chapter 2).

England and Spain both wanted to keep a positive relationship with one another. Spain, for her part, wanted to keep Mary off the throne of England, because that would endanger Flanders and the Spanish Netherlands (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 64). Besides that, Philip sought to obtain a Habsburg-Tudor marriage alliance. There was a division in Elizabeth’s court between a pro-Habsburg group that was more conservative, and a more radically protestant group led by the Earl of Leicester (Doran, “Religion and Politics at the Court of Elizabeth I”, *English Historical Review* 1989, pp. 908-909). The early failure of marriage negotiations was more about difficulties of a foreign suitor than his Catholicism. The negotiations dragged on for years, and eventually failed entirely because the two sides could not come to an agreement on religion.

There was some popular discontent against the pro-Spanish policies of Elizabeth. The most obvious was the independently financed pirates/privateers that raided or traded in Spanish territories in the Americas (Andrews, *Elizabethan Privateering*). It was only in the mid 1570s with the revolt in the Netherlands and successful harassment of Spain in the Atlantic that Elizabeth took a more anti-Spanish position. Elizabeths continued support of men like Francis Drake, and support for the Protestants in the Netherlands was what drove Philip to war against England (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 76-77, 85-87). 

By the time that England's elite were willing to wage open war against Spain, the population was sufficiently committed and converted as well. The real result of the Armada was that it convinced Englishmen that they were the superior nation, that God had made them the victors in 1588. It gave the hotter protestants greater motivation to plant Roanoke in NC (then called Virginia), to attempt their own invasion of Spain that failed miserably, and eventually to the sack of Cadiz in 1596 that cemented the Englishmen's high opinion of themselves. 

Again, it's hard to track where the population lie on issues of international dispute. The dislike of foreigners was not unique to protestants, but it did help them fan the flames against possible Catholic suitors for Elizabeth, or help them advocate for the execution of Mary.

Do you mean the actual slave trade practiced by the United States after it had become independent from Britain? Or are you looking for the long history of this issue?

Estimates on the volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade vary, but most scholars accept tend to accept the estimates provided by David Eltis, et al, in the [Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database](http://slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates). The estimate is that 12,500,000 slaves were embarked onto vessels along the African Coast, and 10,700,000 disembarked in the New World. This excludes those brought from Africa to Europe, and the huge number of slaves who died on the journey to the coast (Miller, *Way of Death*, pp. 140-153). Of all the slaves disembarked in the New World, approximately 500,000 arrived in the territory now called the United States. Of that number, only 106,000 arrived after the United States became independent (though that number will likely increase with the publication [Craig Hollander's](https://history.tcnj.edu/craig-hollander/) Ph.D. thesis on the illegal slave trade).

Finally, /u/EvanRWT is correct that you need to be specific about where in Africa you are talking about. Estimates from the Eltis database show a rough breakdown of the following:

Slave trade to the United States

Senegambia: 14,000

Sierra Leone: 24,000

Windward Coast: 6,500

Gold Coast: 20,000

West Central Africa: 32,000

Other: 10,000

Because of my position, as a guy who lives in europe, is from a relevant cultural background, and who used to be a caribbean-region sovereign debt economist, I'm kind of in a special position to share insight on this question. It also puts me on BOTH sides of this issue. 

I want to start by saying that while I don't usually elaborate which specific European country (because I'm tied to THREE of them), I'm make the exception of naming them, just this once, since they were definitely slave-trading colonial nations, but they also **definitely got reparations from Germany**. To be specific. France, Belgium, and Holland. 

What I can say is that:

1. We've seen reparations done right, and we've seen them done badly. it's important to know the difference. 

2. As a ""Belgian"", we definitely got money and land from the Germans after WWI and again after WWII. Also, we definitely owe most of our current wealth to the resources extracted from the congo. we used guns to steal it. now they have nothing. we kinda owe it. In the same way, the Germans used guns to steal lots of our stuff (and our people). and that was the basis of our claim for reparations from germany. 

2. Current French and Dutch fortunes are more than definitely based on well-invested profits gained originally slavery and colonialism in various parts of the globe. Slavery was big business. So were the cashcrops such as sugar, rum, rubber, tobacco, and cotton. It generated a lot of wealth, which is still present today. Anybody who visits central Amsterdam (or Brussels) will notice that most of the large, fancy infrastructure was built during that period in history. with funds drawn that way. 

3. France demanded and got reparations from slavery. **From Haiti**. Can you believe it? They demanded compensation for ""lost human capital"", which resulted from the haitian revolution. Paying that off bankrupted Haiti until 1947, when they finished paying it by handing over the majority of their yearly budget. 

4. **Reparations are about righting past wrongs which, still have their economic effects today**. With all of that said, I realize that simply handing over cash doesn't actually right the wrongs. It just impoverishes the party who pays. Look at what happened to Germany and France. Germany got desperately poor after WWI, but France didn't get fabulously wealthy. 

5. Righting the wrongs, IMO isn't about transferring cash. it's about sharing the means of production, and about guaranteeing economic access. That's what we got from the Germans after 1945. It has made Belgium, Holland, and France fabulously wealthy, and it hasn't broken the Germans economically, and today's generations definitely feel that wrongs caused by past German aggression have been dealt with. 

6. In a similar vein, the demands of caribbean nations towards europe today, vis-a-vis slavery, are exactly those. that Britain, France, and Holland share the means of production, and guarantee economic access. Simply transferring cash isn't going to do much for all the tiny places in the caribbean who were ruined by slavery &amp; colonialism. But help with industrialization, human capital formation, and protected trade access to the EU markets definitely would. 

7. At an individual level, in a place like the US, the question should ALSO not be about money. it should be about access. ",False,0,CapitalismVSocialism,Classical Economics (true capitalism),2,bridgeton_man,Capitalist1,t5_3cct3

That's what happened after World War I, where the German victory against the fledgling Soviet Union was rolled back after German defeat on the Western Front. Significantly, the USSR had little say in final results in East Central Europe after the First World War, so I suspect that in such a scenario - an unaided Soviet victory over the Germans in World War II - would end up similarly, that is with German gains in the West rolled back and with the Soviets more or less unilaterally determining the geo-political make-up of Western Europe. This suspicion is furthered by the actual events on the ground in Eastern Europe after the real German defeat - the Soviets determined the geo-political make-up unilaterally with little regard for the wishes of their erstwhile allies or even the local inhabitants themselves. 

But just so we're clear, when an American says to you, ""you'd be speaking German right now if..."" they don't necessarily mean you'd actually be *speaking* German so much as you'd be under German political control. I think that specific claim is an overstatement that's got a kernel of truth hidden in there (and also an asshole-ish thing to say to someone). A more accurate statement might be:

&gt;Absent the efforts of the United States during and immediately after the Second World War, including the presence of many millions of fighting men on the continent and many billions of dollars of American aid, the core of Western and Northern Europe - France, the Benelux nations, Denmark and Norway (significantly excepting neutral Sweden and Switzerland) - likely would have fallen under the complete control of either the Nazis, the Soviet Union, or both, for an extended period of time - a generation or more - and that would almost certainly have included the loss of democratic institutions and the creation of an oppressive police state, as *actually happened* in Eastern Europe.  

I think most historians would agree with that statement. This of course doesn't change the fact that it very much remains conjecture, as we don't *really* know what would have happened if the US hadn't interfered in the Second World War because the US did interfere, both early and often.

She's also pushing for more Political Correctness, safe spaces, ETC. Which impedes our first commandment right, and admires the Australia gun ban, impeding our second amendment right. At the end of the day, anyone is better than Hillary.

Trump wants to deport ILLEGAL Immigrants, who are taking up residence, and money, without paying proper taxes? Thus putting in insane strain on the economy, and wants to make it much harder to let a group of people who have a much higher chance of committing a terrorist attack to enter the country. (Look at Europe). It's not so much that people want it because they hate the group. A good chunk of Trump supporters are fairly well educated, and he's winning more of the African American vote everyday. He's not racist, he said some sexist things a few years ago, sure, but we all make sexist jokes. Hillary defended a child fucking rapist. That's inexcusable, on top of the many other things she did.

In Europe we literally decide that people are going to die. I don't think that is bad, since it gives everyone an equal change of healthcare. I actually wouldn't want to trade it in for the American system under any circumstances.

But it is true that we need to set priorities. We have a limited amount of money to spend on healthcare, and we decide to spend that as effectively as possible.

So we have the Treaty of Versailles in which the French managed to get the famous Kriegsschuldklausel. One of the aims of this was to make Germany liable for the damages in Eastern France. It was also convenient for France (many French hated Germany) to settle the question of guilt like this.

An [/r/AskHistorians post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3vnzt8/it_has_been_argued_that_the_blockade_of_germany/cxp83tk/) tries to summarize:

&gt;As Article 231 of the Treaty was actually written, it was never intended to be an assessment of 'War Guilt' with the criminal liability that would imply exactly, but instead a worldwide assessment of the Central Powers' civil liability to the people and institutions they harmed with their execution of a brutal war of aggression. The real question of how the Treaty of Versailles contributed to WWII is not really a question of how supposedly harsh it was, but a question of how it came to be viewed as so harsh. French Prime Minister Clemenceau certainly didn't help with pronouncements like how the problem with Germans was that there were 20 million too many, but a better answer perhaps could be found in Germans retaining the same attitudes towards war that justified the horrors of the Schlieffen Plan and the sacking of Leuven to begin with.

Between the wars the way WWI was seen in Britain changed. It was now seen as a prime example of the futility of war and a Battle of no better Empire. During this time German interwar-propaganda became very influential in Britain.

A [post in /r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/23g1px/in_your_opinion_which_was_a_bigger_cause_for_wwii/cgwod8b/) summarizes this pretty nicely:

&gt; There is no serious case left standing that Versailles caused the Second World War; it is a zombie historical idea that refuses to die despite being comprehensively refuted by modern specialists.
There was a resurgence of pro-German sentiment in postwar England, which was related to the popular reaction against the extraordinary casualties and seeming pointlessness of the trench struggle. John Maynard Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace was tremendously influential, and the Weimar government skillfully manipulated international public opinion. This has led to the widespread acceptance of any number of myths about Versailles.

After WWII when Germany and France tried to create a lasting friendship politicians agreed on settling the question by saying that as you said, the complete system of Europe was at fault for WWI and nobody was the good guy, but all were just equally bad. 

This was of course very convenient because it ended serious actual discussion about it and post-war Europe was tired of discussing old things and wanted to move on.

Now in 1961 German historian Fritz Fischer came along. He was the first historian to have full access to the entire remaining German WWI archives. Previous historians had only been able to access heavily edited archives that had been created in order to support the view that war was the inevitable product of the breakdown of international diplomacy, rather than the end result of German expansionist ambitions.

In a nutshell his famous (or infamous) Fischer Thesis stated that WWI was basically a war of German aggression and Germany could have very much not started it.

Fischer was extremely controversial but he did manage to revitalize the discussion that was quenched after WWII.

This discussion is still going on. American historian tried to summarize in 1991:

&gt;  It is certainly not true, however, that the views of the Fischer school have come to be almost universally shared, either inside Germany or out. The older interpretations of people like Pierre Renouvin, Bernadotte Schmitt, and Luigi Albertini--which, while quite critical of Germany, never went so far as to claim that the German government deliberately set out to provoke a general war--are still very widely accepted.

Indeed, a big factor for the large increases were insurers taking the loss leader route to attract customers in the first two years (although I bet they still made a profit).

The solution is to get a public insurance option that will be cheaper than private insurers due to efficiencies and no need for profit. That requires a Democratic Congress.

&gt;tem mais é que simplificar essa nossa língua complexa.

Primeiro que você não consegue simplificar uma língua através da ortografia, as convenções ortográficas, que é o que se muda com a reforma, são somente uma maneira de escrever a língua. Ninguém muda sua forma de falar por causa de um acordo.

Segundo que é muito difícil medir complexidade de uma linguagem, hoje em dia os linguistas descartam essas comparações(x língua é mais complexa que y), então, não, a nossa língua não é especialmente complexa. 

Terceiro, que o objetivo da reforma não era ""simplificar"" (o que isso significa?) a ortografia, era unir as convenções brasileiras e portuguesas.

&gt;Vai dizer que quando você lê ""quero beber água de coco"" você entende que eu quero beber esgoto?

Ao definir uma ortografia, você pode usar uma abordagem fonética ou etimológica. Fonética quer dizer que existe uma alta correspondência entre fala e escrita (cada palavra é fácil de soletrar e pronunciar), esse é o caso do espanhol, etimológica quer dizer que você preserva como as palavras são escritas (escrever shampoo em vez de xampu, por exemplo, assim fica fácil descobrir a origem da palavra), que é o caso do inglês.

Firstly, imposing tariffs on imports from China would [hurt American consumers](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_bPhkXOCq57dbfql) by raising prices on a huge array of goods: clothing, electronics, furniture, etc. would all become much more expensive. In addition, singling out China for tariffs would make our relationship with them much more overtly hostile: having freer trade between two nations makes them much more willing to work out disagreements diplomatically, since they rely on one another for their economic prosperity.

The tariffs harm both the American and Chinese economies, both of which benefit Russia.

&gt;Dropping sanctions would...

The sanctions were imposed in response to Russia challenging the US-led regional order in Europe: many Eastern European countries that were formerly Soviet Bloc states now want to place themselves under the umbrella of NATO to gain security against Russia. Ukraine was one such state, and Russia's moves there were aimed specifically at keeping Ukraine out of NATO. 

Given that Russia has been making numerous attempts at [violating the airspace of Baltic states](http://www.newsweek.com/russia-prompts-20-nato-air-force-scrambles-baltic-508727), [building up their military presence on their borders](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-06/putin-s-military-buildup-in-the-baltic-stokes-invasion-fears), and  [sailing warships in Scandinavian waters](https://geopoliticsmadesuper.com/2014/10/27/why-bully-peaceful-sweden-because-some-people-just-cant-help-themselves/), a lot of players in the region are worried about renewed Russian agression, and rightfully so.

The sanctions regime has had a [devastating effect](http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2015/Russia/sanctions-after-crimea-have-they-worked/EN/index.htm) on the Russian economy: they've gone into a recession, they're burning through their foreign currency reserves, and their businesses are suffering thanks to a lack of foreign investment. 

This gives us a big lever to get Russia to cease aggressive actions against our allies in the region. Think of the sanctions on Iran: they, too, had a big effect on the Iranian economy, and the promise to lift them was what got the Iranians to the negotiating table in order to curtail their nuclear weapons program and to allow UN investigators into their sites.

Having that economic lever puts the United States in a position of strength. To throw away such a valuable tool without receiving something equally valuable in exchange would be a really shitty deal for us. And given how Russia has been acting in bad faith up to this point, we couldn't possibly expect them to suddenly reverse course now.",False,0,askhillarysupporters,,1,ExUnoPlures,,t5_3ct1i

And my absolutely favourite deck in ygo was a water deck based off of a structure deck called ""Fury from the Deep"" and included some of my favourite cards like ""Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus"", ""Mermaid Knight"" (she can do multiple attacks, you'll see a pattern soon), ""Sea Serpent Warrior of Darkness"", ""A Legendary Ocean"" etc.

So I got into CFV about the time that stuff like Ezel came out here in Europe. The yugioh meta was stale and two of my friends who stopped playing ygo switched to cfv. They tried to get me interested, but I didn't really like it much at the time, I felt that the art was overdone (or just waifu material, which I can't take seriously myself at all, even Mallika is a tad too much, now imagine me seeing BT), decks didn't look thematically similar enough and the gameplay felt too simplistic and non-interactive (no trap cards, duh). Also, I had no idea AqF even existed at the time.

So these two friends and me are sitting in the shop, they're asking me what I would want from the game to get me playing. So this is basically what I said: ""Well, the only way I'd play it is if I find a deck that I'd feel comfortable with (hah, good luck with the conditions I'm about to lay on you, I thought). I'd strongly prefer it to be water based, with more consistent art style than the rest of the clans I saw. Prefferably some sort of underwater army, with battle sea creatures like mermaides that aren't some sort of ecci material (looking at you BT). Also, their leaders should be some sort of powerful sea serpent or dragon like creatures that look majestic. Also, I'd enjoy playing it if they helped each other and maybe have offensive power with lots of small attacks.""

This caused one of my friend to almost fall of his seat in laughter and the Naru player was speachless for a while before bursting into the longest laughter I've ever seen from him. After literal 15 minutes or so, when they caught a breath, one of them managed to point a finger and they managed to speak four words: ""Buy that trial deck.""

Pretty ashamed to say I've nearly 1K games and I never fully grokked the fundamentals, but hey, learning is learning. Better late than never.

I recently had a loss on Braxis Holdout and while I died 5 times (looking back, ALL of these could have been avoidable if I had played safer and not done really dumb stuff, but i'm trying to improve bit by bit), we still kept up with them in talents until the end, though a few choice kills by the enemy team basically sealed our fate.

There were at least 2 moments pre level 10 and post level 10 where I had the nagging feeling I should GTFO and help my 4v5'ed team, but I stuck to my guns to get us over the line for talent tiers. In hindsight, I'm really not sure if I went completely the opposite way and ignored my team in dire need (not that they all got wiped, of course). Thinking on it now, I should've helped my team post level 10 and upped the ante against the level 12 enemies (**especially** since the objective was up and top beacon was being contested... Doh!). :P Common sense is in short supply, I guess, but I think i'm improving myself - that above point is something I really have to keep in mind: Stick With The Team AFTER LEVEL 10.

Good luck with that guide! It sounds like ALOT of work, I hope it can come to fruition.

I was talking about how the average inhabitant of the Byzantine Empire would identify throughout the history of the empire. The island in question (Lemnos) was inhabited by Christian Greek speakers, not Muslim Turks. The whole conversation between the soldier and local children, as reported by a Greek historian, took place in Greek.

The average Muslim inhabitant of the Ottoman Empire would most certainly not identify as a Roman, although some of the monarchs (like Fatih Mehmet) claimed to be continuators of the Roman tradition. 

As for primary sources that disprove the Ottoman-Fascist analogy, de Busbecq and  Wortley Montagu come to mind, although there are many more. These two were European diplomats who visited the Ottoman Empire respectively in the 16th and 17th centuries. 

The books I cited in the earlier comment have plenty of primary sources (mostly written in Greek, but translated by Kaldellis and quoted in his narrative). Chapters 4 and 5 of *The Byzantine Republic* are particularly relevant to this conversation.

É justamente o amplo apoio que gera pressão - e algumas vezes, mudança ou pelo menos respostas. 

O que me incomoda é que parece que eles não percebem que, apesar de ser uma manifestação em prol de direitos, causa prejuízo para outras pessoas. Parece uma ausência de empatia. Mas é claro que eu realmente não tenho conhecimento, não estou participando nem visitei alguma ocupação para entender direito. É só um esboço de pensamento.

The campaign was tinged with racist appeals to nationalism.  It didn't dominate the election debate anywhere near as much as I see it being reported it did in the press, but it was there and it did have an effect on the way many people voted.  This was primarily because the racist elements within the otherwise quite legitimate Leave campaign didn't appeal directly to race issues, but referred instead to 'immigrants', so as to seem as if they were talking about the real problems which exist around the Syrian refugee crisis.  But in truth this was used as way to nod and wink to the 'coming over here, taking our jobs' element, who read the Daily Mail and Rupert Murdoch's Sun tabloid.   The Sun is read by around 13.6m people every week, which in a country with a population of 64 million people is readership of about 8%.  The Leave campaign won by 52%.

What surprises me is that, as you say, the racists for Trump have taken a much more open approach.  If they'd been a bit more behind the scenes about it, perhaps people wouldn't have noticed.  So in a way it's a good thing that they're being so blatant - because it leaves no doubt that he's quite deliberately using a dog-whistle approach.

You seem unable to separate an explanation of why someone ELSE did something in the 1930s with my personal opinion of how it should be done in 2016. They are not the same.

However, for a start how would moving her to another community help? The whole assessment of the situation was based on the perception and probable observation that girls with no strong male familial ties within these groups are vulnerable, this would have been true across all the aboriginal communities, even more so the futher she got from her original family. Also you're assuming that there existed some sort of structure that could identify and locate safe havens and then support her there. There just didnt. 

Concerns about the kids wishes and 'fundamental' human rights barely matter now, they were irrelevant back then. What about the fundamental right not to be left somewhere that white people know you're going to raped? 

The only options being Probable Rape vs Reeducation WERE the only two. This isnt a theoretical discussion about what we'd like to occur when we play the game from the start, this is what was available at the time. There were no social workers for aboriginals, or even Australians, and there were no structures in place to control and manage these situations. Many Aboriginal communities were largely isolated from the European ones and generally lived their stone-age hunter-gatherer style social structures. They were slowly being educated in the 'modern' ways but mainly by some form of Osmosis. There were Aborigines at the time who were almost entirely westernised and some who had not even met white man yet. There was no coherent plan for this situation.

Do I have concrete evidence? Of course not, the evidence would have been largely anecdotal based on observation, little or no modern style analysis was done of these situations. I have read letters or notes that suggest the men in charge believed these things to be true, and it also falls into a pattern, not well documented cos of its unsavorieness, whereby indigenous cultures dont have the same sexual inhibitions and beliefs that christian westerners did. These communities wouldnt have even been, in many cases, untouched and 'pure', but encampments where the Aborigines had been corralled, leading to the usual stress and breakdown in controls that occur in such places.

My implicit implication (sic) is that the people in charge believed western life to be 'normal' and desirable. Your assumption is again to believe that explaining why Hitler thought and acted in some way means that I think the same thing.

&gt; Robert Anthony Plant CBE (born 20 August 1948, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England) is a British rock singer-songwriter famous for being the lead vocalist of one of the most influential bands of all time: Led Zeppelin. He is known for his powerful style and wide vocal range. After Led Zeppelin's breakup following the sudden death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, Plant pursued a successful solo career. Popular tracks from this period include ""Big Log"", ""Tall Cool One"", ""In the Mood"", and ""I Believe"". Throughout his career, he's been influenced by many styles such as blues, folk, 50s rock and roll, dance pop, and more.

&gt; In 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star retro rock group with musicians Jimmy Page (also of Led Zeppelin), Jeff Beck, and Phil Collins called The Honeydrippers. The band had a Top Ten hit with their song ""Sea of Love"", a remake of the Phil Phillips' chestnut. Plant's also notably performed with Page in the outfit Page &amp; Plant.

&gt; Plant's love of the music of Morocco led him to a new collaboration called Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation.  The band's releases met with critical acclaim and numerous Grammy nominations. They completed a notable 2006 tour of Europe in September.

&gt; In 2007, Plant began recording and performing with American bluegrass star Alison Krauss. A duet album, Raising Sand, was released on 23 October 2007 on Rounder Records. The album, recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and produced by T-Bone Burnett, met with enormous critical and commercial success. Tours have reached devoted audiences in multiple cities.

&gt; The year of 2010 proves to be yet another successful year for the lemon squeezer. During the summer, Plant will be reuniting with his old, Pre-Zep group, The Band Of Joy, for a tour of the southern and mid continental tour of the US.

&gt; In 2012 Robert Plant starts another band project going by the name Sensational Space Shifters releasing the live album Robert Plant Presents: Sensational Space Shifters. Along with Plant himself the band consists of Liam ""Skin"" Tyson, Justin Adams, Billy Fuller and John Baggot along with Dave Smith, Juldeh Camara and Patty Griffin.  Read more on Last.fm.

I was single for a full two years plus after that, going on dates that didn't work out, hooking up with the same 2-3 people to stave off the loneliness while my asshole ex moved on within 30 seconds to a new girl who he dated (and cheated on) for that entire 2 year plus period. 

Block her, accept the pain, and go out and do everything you know you should anyway. Fake it till you make it. You've gone out on a few dates, even if they didn't work out - you had a good evening right? Focus on that. Get an FWB even if you don't want a relationship. Put yourself out there - not necessarily searching for a new relationship but new experiences. 

I met my now boyfriend a year and a half ago while living in Europe on a work project that I got put on last minute on tinder which I joined just to get laid. I'm happier than I've ever been. 

I mean sure, even now seeing my ex somewhere isn't a very pleasant experience. The other day I went down to my favourite cafe to grab lunch and I saw him there with his new girlfriend (the one after the girl he cheated on me with). I turned and went out and to a new restaurant, which I'm not proud of. But it doesn't matter. I'm happy and I'm okay and you will be too.

First, suppose that the definition of ""effort"" was changed to this:  ""effort is doing something that goes against the flow of dopamine"".  Now consider two people, A and B.  They are given a math worksheet.  Person A finds the problems to be challenging.  Person B finds the problems to be easy.  Worse, person B finds them so easy that they fear it is actually holding them back.  Person A receives dopamine for completing the worksheet and getting a good grade.  Person B loses dopamine for completing the worksheet regardless of the grade.  By our definition of ""effort"", it takes person B more effort to do the worksheet than person A.  More so, it would take person A more effort to *not* do the worksheet than to do it, because not doing it would go against the flow of dopamine.  This contrasts the standard understanding of ""effort"" which would imply they required the same effort for the same task, or that person B required less effort due to higher competence.  Our new definition of ""effort"" is based on physical things that exist in the world, that are theoretically possible to measure.  The standard definition of ""effort"" is abstract and vague.  

Okay, now, forget about that and imagine the following scenario:  It is Europe in the year 1000 AD.  Students are in Bible class at church (required).  All of the students believe Moses parted the Red Sea.  Except for one student, say Bob.  For some reason Bob has a hard time with this.  The other students look at Bob like he is an idiot because he has a hard time understanding that Moses parted the Red Sea.  They say to him ""How can you not understand this?  It is so simple.  It is easy for *me* to understand.  What is the difficulty?  Are you stupid?  What is wrong with you?""  Then one day Bob realizes that A) Moses never parted the Red Sea, B) Moses never existed, C) the story was completely made up by men, and D) it was made up by men to suppress people that believe it.  So not only was everyone in the class wrong (except for Bob), but they were wrong in a humiliating way (believing something designed to suppress them), and not only were they wrong in a humiliating way, but they were wrong in the face of (what is to Bob) kindergarten level thinking.  Once Bob understands this, he can receive dopamine for doing a worksheet about Moses (you can reflect on the previous paragraph again).  One of the fascinating things about this example is all of the extremes involved.  

If you haven't stopped reading, you might be rolling your eyes thinking ""sure, but that is an extreme special case, there is nothing in the world today such that a change in perspective could be so well defined and profound that it actually changes the flow of dopamine in the brain"".  And this is where I say that there does exist, in the world today, a change in prospective that is actually more well defined and more more profound than the example above.  

Do any of the following statements resonate with you in some way?  
-- Schools teach nothing important about the man-made world.  For example:  Where are real-estate records kept?  How does credit reporting work down to a fine detail?  Is it possible to run a background check on yourself?  How do you go about looking up laws?  What certifications exist?  How do retailers find distributors?  Who decides speed limits?  How does an auto-dealer license work?  What is the Associated Press?  The list of questions goes on and on.  Instead of learning how the man-made world really works, students are required to read fiction novels that are utter garbage, and often have little ""lessons"" in them.  
-- How do we explain the contradiction between the cries for the US to be more competitive at math verses the reality that simple but important information is withheld from most students?  Information like the fact that the IMO even exists.  Much less the content it covers.  
-- Schools teach nothing important about the physical world (we already covered the man-made world).  I could talk about this for hours.  But instead of going over this massive beast of a topic, I'll just point out this:  Many students receive an A in a class, and think they have learned something, but are unaware that the rate at which they are ""learning"" is such that they will never ever be competitive in the subject.  When you get tongue tied trying to explain this, you are labeled as lazy and dumb.
