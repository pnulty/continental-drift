&gt; LONDON - Five members of a gang that trafficked people from eastern Europe to Britain and forced them to live in inhumane conditions while working to pay off fictional debts were sentenced by a British court on Monday.

&gt; The sentencing came days after Britain unveiled two multi-million pound funds to tackle modern slavery overseas and at home as part of a drive to end the crime described as a &amp;quot;Barbaric evil&amp;quot; by Prime Minister Theresa May. Prosecutors said the gang targeted vulnerable people in the Czech Republic who might not immediately be noticed as missing and trafficked them to the UK. &amp;quot;They were then treated as commodities to be used however the defendants saw fit,&amp;quot; prosecutor Ann Hampshire said in a statement.

&gt; Britain last year passed tough anti-slavery legislation introducing life sentences for traffickers and forcing companies to disclose what they are doing to make sure their supply chains are free from slavery.

&gt; On Wednesday, however, Trump found himself among a roomful of policy wonks when he delivered his first major foreign policy address at the Mayflower Hotel under the auspices of a Washington establishment think tank: **the Center for the National Interest**. 
&gt; ____

&gt; That Trump would choose the Center for the National Interest as the place to premier his new seriousness **on foreign policy has Manafort’s fingerprints all over it**. For Manafort and the Center have something very important in common: **both have ties to the Russian regime of President Vladimir Putin, (whose ambassador to the United States sat in the front row for Trump’s address)**.
&gt; ____
&gt; As for **the Center, both it and its journal, the National Interest, are two of the most Kremlin-sympathetic institutions in the nation’s capital**, even more so that the Carnegie Moscow Center,
&gt; _____
&gt; **For years, the Center for the National Interest partnered with the Russian government-funded Institute for Democracy and Cooperation**, a New York-based institution whose head, Adranik Migranyan, was **personally appointed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov**, according to a State Department cable released by Wikileaks. In May 2014, **the two think tanks held a press conference defending Russia’s position in Ukraine**.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Another association connecting Trump to the Center is **Richard Burt**, **chairman of the National Interest’s advisory council,** and a former ambassador to Germany and State Department official during the Reagan administration. According to a knowledgeable source, Burt, who had previously worked as an unpaid advisor to former Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, **has been enlisted by Manafort to join Trump’s campaign and helped draft his speech** (neither Burt nor Manafort responded to inquiries). **Burt sits on the senior advisory board of the** **Russian Alfa Bank**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; **Burt also expressed skepticism about the relevance of NATO, another Trump talking point**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; [Burt] spoke favorably of Trump’s “America First” policy (a term that Trump explicitly used in his speech Wednesday, declaring that it “will be the major and overriding theme of my administration”) and expressed agreement with the candidate’s comments on America’s allies posing a “free rider problem.” (Perhaps blowing a kiss at Trump, on April 14 the Center hosted a panel discussion with Burt and University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer entitled, **“Does America Need Allies?”**)

See, most (if not all) countries have their own football federation (like England and the FA or Germany and the DFB), which organizes how tournaments are played in each country. Different federations have different competitions (in England's case, they have the Premier League, the FA Cup, etc). National federations then unite themselves into continental federations (such as the UEFA, which aggregates all European federations), which organize continental cups (UEFA, for instance, has the Champions League and the Europa League). Finally, all national federations are affiliated to FIFA, which is a global organization that divides money between those national federations and organizes world tournaments and such.

All national federations have their own peculiarities, but most have more or less similar competitions. Let's take the English FA for instance. Their teams are divided into different tiers (usually called ""divisions""), and clubs move from one division to another every season based on their results. For instance, a club that wins the second division is promoted to the first one, and one that ends in last place in the first division is relegated to the second. The English first division is called the Premier League. Most first divisions around the world follow the same format, with some minor tweaks: twenty clubs play against each other twice in a round-robin format; a win earns you three points, a tie earns you one and a loss gives you none; the one that gets the most points in the end wins the league.

Those continental confederations (UEFA, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL...) organize tournaments that gather the top teams from each country. The European Cup, for instance, was a tournament that'd gather all champion clubs from all European leagues and put them in a simple, straightforward knockout tournament to determine the best European club; currently, Europe has the Champions League, which has the same objective of gathering the best European clubs and crowning the best of them, but they now have different qualifying methods. England, Spain, Germany and Italy, instead of only one spot, get four, while contenders from smaller leagues such as, say, the Austrian, Greek or the Croatian ones have to play a qualifying tournament to make it to the Champions League. Criteria for getting these spots depends on each continental confederation. FIFA then gathers all continental cup winners and organizes the Club World Cup, and the winner of this tournament is technically the best club in the world.

Besides club competitions, we also have national team competitions, where each national federation summons the best players of the country to represent them. FIFA organizes every four years the World Cup, which is the most important tournament for those national teams. Each continental federation also organizes its own national team tournament, such as the Euro Cup or the Copa América.",False,0,soccer,Fluminense,1,CruzeiroDoSul,s1 228 team-228 country-bra,t5_2qi58

&gt;* Although 65% of the Jewish population of the city was exterminated during the Second World War, those who had remained, their ranks swelled by others fleeing former Nazi-occupied countries in Eastern Europe, had been able to regain control of the centuries-old diamond trade.

&gt;* Today, companies that had begun as one-man operations dealing with a handful of diamonds at a time, have been transformed into billion dollar, global enterprises, employing thousands of workers, with factories and offices dotted across the world.

&gt;* When I informed the Chinese host that his Jain guests were not only vegetarian but didnt eat onions or indeed any kind of root vegetable at all, the gentleman in question gasped as if in the throes of a painful bout of indigestion.

&gt;* The evidence for this claim involves a medieval English poem and a painting by Flemish master Pieter Brueghel the elder, but to avoid bewildering the reader by a lengthy digression, I will skip the details and go straight to a meeting I had with Charles Blommaert, an earnest-faced Belgian cricket lover a few months later.

The LPC would have to be drastically different than it currently is on a number of issues, not just economics for me to consider voting for them. I'm a Conservative Libertarian who is centrist on social issues. I reject the identity politics of the Liberal party and their ""progressive"" social agenda, I reject their weak, morally relativist foreign policy, and I reject their tendency to view government as a solution rather than a problem. The Liberals are center-right on some economic issues, but not to the degree that I want. So overall they'd have to look a lot different than they do now for me to consider them. Beyond that, the CPC would have to become much more populist on economics than it currently is, and become more socially authoritarian for me to view the Liberals as preferential, rather than just equal. This is actually the opposite of what is happening, so the CPC is the obvious choice for any classical liberal, neoliberal, libertarian, or fiscal conservative. 

&gt; I think PR could be a massive positive for a Libertarian (please correct me if I'm wrong - this is all good faith conversation, so I'll take corrections in good faith), in that it could let Libertarian Liberals, NDP, and Green break ranks. 

I'm skeptical. If European countries are any indication, a likely outcome is that Conservative Libertarian, Conservative Liberal, Liberal Conservative, Neoliberal, etc, parties are forced to join coalitions with populist, nationalist, and/or social conservative parties to form government. The alternative there is to coalition with centrist liberal parties, but this seems highly unlikely in Canada due to the historical adversary between the Grits &amp; Tories. Europe is different in that power generally swings between a center right party and a left wing labour or socialist party. Here I just don't see a scenario under PR where a libertarian conservative or PC party coalitions with the LPC, with the NDP, Greens, Bloc, and Christian Heritage Party in opposition. I suppose it's possible but I'm highly skeptical. 

So my preference remains keeping FPTP, or if we must change, going to STV and keeping the CPC a big tent party united on economic and foreign policy issues. So Cons are welcome here, but they are not welcome to drive the agenda. Their views are not in line with the majority of Canadians and only prevent us from winning elections, guaranteeing far less desirable results. It's unfortunate that many of them fail to understand this, that a socially centrist CPC is better for their interests than a socially far left LPC or NDP, but most of them can't keep their mouths shut.

Not true. Many South Americans and middle easterners are in the 90s.  Also worth noting that there are so many Asians and Euros that the global average IQ is just under 100. 

&gt; Perhaps its something about how the Europeans came in and fucked up the Africans through forcing colonies on them and half-genocided the Native Americans? And I'm sure the CIA and USSR didn't do anything to keep the area in conflict.

Europeans were advanced as hell long before they ever came into contact with the sub-saharans. Why weren't the Africans developed? Is there an answer to this or are you just going to rationalize away all scientific progress as unnecessary to them?

&gt; What makes that the most offensive one to you?

Not to me personally, but people get antsy when you mention Jews.

&gt; Oh, so nobody ever agrees with ideas from a group they aren't part of?

My point is that nobody can rightfully claim that their ideology is objectively best/better for others than the other persons. There are many more hardcore Christians or Muslims than progressives and I'd bet that racists heavily outnumber all three of those groups, perhaps even all three of those groups put together. I'm not saying that means that the alt right is necessarily best for every person, but you must see why I find it dubious when I hear you claim that progressivism is. 

&gt; Did they reject progressive ideas? Or just reject Democrats and Hillary? There is a significant difference. You may have noticed a huge chunk of the Republican party rejected Trump due to their progressive ideas, and even his own Vice President candidate can't (or wont!) defend him.

I live in a swing state where Trump has shown up dozens of times and I've been to a fuck ton of rallies. There is not a whole lot of progressivism there and the people don't tend to mind when I make racist or sexist comments. Most of them actually respond really positively and enjoy hearing what I have to say.

&gt; Never claimed ""Holy"". I don't agree with quite a few parts of it, myself. But holy shit the alt right... That group has problems.

So far you haven't pointed out any. You've kinda made up some positions for us, such as wanting to do XYZ to non-whites or treat them in XYZ way.

So far, you haven't critiqued that position even a little bit.

&gt; So, they didn't half-genocide the Native Americans?

We didn't even know half of those diseases existed and then it was the Natives who couldn't find a cure. 

&gt; And colonizing Africa had no ill effects either? 

Colonizing Africa was the greatest gift we possibly could have given them. We gave them technology, rule of law, medicine, instructions on how to build a stable society, etc. The only reason there is any science or development in Africa is because of whites and they should be thanking us. 

&gt; And the CIA didn't fuck up any other countries out there, no way did they overthrow their governments to install puppet regimes.

If you look at the 19th century and the second industrial revolution, you also have lots of discoveries being made by Germans, Brits and Americans, very few by Russians or Eastern Europeans (if anything the proportion leaves the future Soviet states even worse off). This speaks to Western societies that had better scientific infrastructure, better institutional memories, and were overall better primed for scientific output than a soviet union that was essentially starting from scratch, and without the support of any recently successful neighbors. In addition, they weren't in a position to learn from previous successes anyway, since they were trying to set themselves up in an entirely different way. So if you like, a better comparison might be between the pre-soviet union states and the soviet union.

As with everything in the old Soviet Union, politics were likely a factor too; we had an article posted just recently here that discussed how political concerns prevented the further development of computational methods for centralized economic planning.

You also have to consider the advancements that they did make, including some pretty significant ones in the field of computer science. I alluded to the Levin theorem (independently discovered in the West a bit later) which is *the* key result in complexity theory, and the Karatsuba algorithm, variants of which are still used to implement multiplication in our computers. They also invented linear programming (which pretty much every business uses nowadays to allocate resources) and did some early experiments with non-binary computing.

**1. TOXICITY ACCUMULATION**

As with most things taking Cinnamon over extended periods of time will build a certain level of toxicity in your body. The recommended dosage of Cinnamon according to the US Department of health, is 6 grams daily for 6 weeks or less. At this level of Cinnamon appears to be safe for most people. We recommend you follow these directions with a week of rest from Cinnamon every 6 weeks. This will allow any toxicity to be purged from your system. Or you could try 5 days and 2 days of rest from Cinnamon on the weekends. 
  

**3. COUMARIN &amp; OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES**

Those who take Cinnamon on a daily basis for dieting or other health reasons should switch to Ceylon Cinnamon, which only has 0.03-0.04% Coumarin. All other types of Cinnamon has high levels (about 0.4-0.8%) Coumarin which can cause liver failure if taken daily or in high doses. The Europeans even banned Cassia Cinnamon for a while because of its effects on the liver. Read our blog post on Coumarin with the latest data here. Cassia Cinnamon contains more styrene, benzene, 1,1′-(2-butene-1,4-diyl)bis-, benzene, 1,1′-(1,2-cyclobutanediyl)bis-, palmitic acid, stearic acid, 4-phenylbutyl chloride, and (2,3-diphenylcyclopropyl) methyl phenyl sulfoxide, which are present in Ceylon Cinnamon in negligible amounts. (Rush University)
 
  
**4. BLOOD THINNER**

Cinnamon apparantly thins your blood. This blood thinning properties are apparantly particularly high in Cassia Cinnamon, while Ceylon Cinnamon does not seem to thin your blood. This blood thinning property of Cassia Cinnamon helps it in acting as an anti-clotting agent especially for those suffering from heart disease. However care must be taken to NOT to take it with other blood thinning medication which is why Docters do not recommend taking Cinnamon while taking medication especially blood thinning medication.",False,0,EatCheapAndHealthy,,26,blackemptiness,,t5_2vvpi

&gt;If the Russians decided to retaliate and proactively strike US targets the NATO treaty would be activated. 

It absolutely would not. First, the area of Syria is not covered under the NATO treaty. Read article five and take a look at a map of where Syria is (I'll give you a hint, it is not in North America or Europe). 

Further the US has no claim to Syria, they aren't our allies, and they haven't been for a very long time. We were not invited into the country, we don't have a causus belli. If we want to act we must go through the UN, where Russia has a veto. NATO members aren't going to back the US trying its damndest to start WWIII. If Hillary tries, she would be impeached.

&gt;I agree that an open war would not be beneficial to either side but that the Russians would have to pay a substantially higher cost and that is why a rational actor would not start a war over it.

By that logic the United States should make every demand it can of Russia. Except it cannot, and it knows that it cannot, because unlike you, and Hillary, people actually understand that there are no winners of nuclear war. 

&gt;It isn't without risk and she said it isn't the first step. But it is a real threat she can back up if the Russians want to stall negotiations on Syria. Russia setting up a no-fly-zone in Iraq (like the person I was responding to suggested) is not a real threat.

Russia establishes a no fly zone over Latvia, rolls tanks in and says to NATO, you respond, and that's aggressive act towards us. Would you buy it?

In this experiment, their metabolisms *tanked*. They were constantly cold. They were lethargic. They got sick very easily. They were irritable and aggressive, and *always* trying to get more food. They were *obsessed* with food. One patient had to be hospitalized for manic behavior.

The US could quite easily draw an imaginary line on the Eastern part of Syria and not have to do anything but wait for the Russians to cross it or prevent the Syrians from crossing it under a guise of a ""safe zone"" for civilians. 

State sovereignty means nothing here.  The most consistent thing about the US is its double standards.  You can just say you don't recognize the state of Syria while ISIS operates in its borders or that since being proven to use chemical weapons on their civilians three separate times aren't legitimate.  It doesn't matter at this point.  There is no international enforcement mechanism and there isn't the power or will from Europe to stop it.  If anything, the US and EU have the power to add sanctions to Russia despite your views on right and wrong.  That is international politics.

Nuclear weapons are a strong defensive deterrent but they wouldn't be practical for preventing US intervention in Syria.  You can saber rattle all you want at NATO forces in Europe but using nuclear weapons against them isn't practical and opens the box to be used in return.  No rational state actor would use them in that circumstance which is why MAD works.  The moment someone uses nuclear weapons the entire game changes.

There is a stark difference between setting up an area of denial and and attacking Russia all across Syria which you seem to be conflating.  And even setting up no-fly zones is nto the first option but the implicit threat if negotiations fall through.  Syria and Assad isn't worth an all out war for Russia either but there needs to be ""leverage"" to prevent them from walking away.  Setting off nuclear bombs across Europe isn't real leverage.

First let me say I love Xenoblade Chronicles. I liked the music. I liked that it had some final fantasy-esque themes. I liked that it was a game where the characters never shut up which led to memorable lines.(like starfox 64 or kid icarus uprising) I liked the goofy voice acting.(just using the eu localization was both cheap and hilarious)

Xenoblade Chronicles X has none of that. The music is... I don't even know how to explain it. Go check out the OST if you don't know what I mean. Instead having a ""get revenge for your beloved peasant village"" plot, it's straight up sci-fi.(I hate sci-fi) The characters are pretty forgettable and had no memorable one liners. The voice acting wasn't even bad, but I really enjoyed the game being full of british accents and mannerisms.

To make matters worse, I was just coming off of FF12 when I started this game. I'm so done with these offline MMO types.

But I did like somethings. I liked customizable party and class system. I liked that being outside was really dangerous(like in etrian odyssey). I liked how the game was exploration  based and was MASSIVE. It was filled with diverse area's the looked beautiful. Probably the best use of the Gamepad on the whole console.

So no, I don't mind being called ""brown"" because I'm ethnically ""brown,"" which for some reason is another word you seem to find offensive.

No? You seem to think it affects me that people don't think anyone from the Bay area is attractive. Obviously, attraction is a matter of opinion and those opinions vary. You don't even know me or how I look, so why exactly would you saying you don't find bay area people attractive offend me or affect me? Hence, my response that I'm not really insecure.  

&gt;Many assholes couch their sexist and racist comments behind opinions thinly veiled as ""facts"".  I think that's my call as a ""brown"" woman making her way in America, just as much as it's your call to use ""half naked"" freely.  If you recall, I never once told you to stop or called you anything rude for using it.  

Okay, but how is it sexist to say people who wear short shorts are ""half naked"" *as a person who wears those shorts on occasion*? I'm pretty sure I'm at perfect liberty to say this considering I partake in it and fully agree that I'm pretty damn exposed and since the hip is basically the midpoint of your body, I *still stand by my phrasing*. You can say we're not half naked as much as you want, but *we still are*. Also, you may have not blatantly said anything but ""many assholes couch their sexist...comments behind opinions thinly veiled as 'facts'"" is a pretty passive aggressive statement.  

**Oh, nice job assuming I wear short shorts on a regular basis, that they're ill-fitting, and that I'm insecure. It's pretty cool how you got all of that from an offhand description of irrelevant and unknown people.

Now this really came out of nowhere because I didn't say that, and I got whatever details I did  from what *you* said:**.  

Umm, no? Here:

If the short shorts you like to wear when you're *calling yourself half naked* expose your ass and *more*, then I get why you consider it so revealing.

But not all shorts do that and wearing ill fitting clothes is kinda at odds with claiming the residents in your district dress particularly well.  

You literally implied that the shorts are such because they're ill-fitting. Those are *your* words, not mine. Also, you've been polite on the surface, however your points are riddled with subtle jabs. Such as the one I just mentioned and when you referred to ""assholes"" ambiguously.  

I think we flogged this dead horse enough. I commend you on your artist modeling as it's something I have been superficially interested in, but don't have the confidence to actually do, so kudos.  

I think we are on two sides of a similar argument. I very much support anybody takin any negative connotations of phrases and turning it around to *own* them. I love when people who are considered ""bitches"" then own the word by being proud of it rather than ashamed. That is how I choose to use the word half naked, both for myself and for other women. We live in a time when women are breaking free of negativity regarding their life choices. With that in mind, unless someone is blatantly condemning someone else for their choice of dress/behaviour/what have you, I choose to own that which people use to try to break us down.  

I also think we are too quick to take the negative aspects of any given idea. Especially recently, we've been conditioned to think innocuous statements are offensive when they're not. I also want to take the time to mention that, as a woman, I appreciate your initial reaction in calling me out for using ""half naked"" when you thought I meant it offensively. We need more women like you who are willing to speak out about unfairness. At the same time, we also need to realize that not everything needs to be seen negatively and that not everyone is inherently a jerk.

A. I would say that allowing a hostile (for whatever reason) nation's claim that they have a historical right to allied nations' territory and then letting them annex it is precisely what occurred in 1939. 

B. I'm all for mutual respect amongst nations, but the idea that Russia is merely reacting to NATO aggression is a bit absurd. Ukraine was pushing for NATO membership even before the invasion, right up to Yanukovych and then afterwards too, because they felt threatened by Russia's influence. Obviously, much like Danzig's agitation for German annexation, the Russian population of Ukraine presents a thornier issue than merely us vs them, but again, it's not just NATO pushing into Ukraine.

C. I appreciate the fact that you're offering the logical Pro-Russian viewpoint here, but you're completely ignoring the equally rational reasons NATO wants to keep Ukraine as a buffer state and a testament to how they will uphold their commitment to their smaller Eastern European members. Nobody thinks Putin has his eye on Germany, but having Russia on their border would make the smaller states nervous and susceptible to being swayed to switch sides. 

The realpolitik here is not that NATO wants Ukraine as a member state; that would go totally against their objectives, as well as Russia's. Having Ukraine serve as an unaligned buffer state allows for quite a bit of posturing and saber-rattling without either side having to make a serious move. Allowing Russia to take it or Russia allowing it to become a NATO member would put one power on the other power's doorstep, which is not an ideal position to be if you're not planning on starting a war.

Seriously? http://stats.noxville.co.za/team/top

Set it to one year view. Wings were top ELO early may, and then top 5 the entire run up to TI being top by a wide margin in july (run up to TI). Merlini predicted them to win etc. They were considered a favourite but innately inconsistent. 

Basically you are wrong. Wings were known for being stupidly strong but crazy drafts sometimes didn't work out for them. Most people had them top 3. Clearly you don't know shit about teams at the time.

If we are doing results based invites purely on the last valve event, EG were bottom 3 at manilla and shouldn't of been invited to TI6. Sometimes teams just have a bad run. The EU major results show pretty fucking clearly EU has been consistently strong (you know winning them all). Seeding and ELO shows EU has been consistently strong too. Right now EU has LESS slots than NA, which has less than half the top end teams, and only two tier 1 teams (both diect invite) leaving the qualifiers without a single tier 1 team while EU has 3 tier 1s fighting for two slots.

I believe you don't see these traits in women, because you believe them to be inherently masculine traits. Female ambition for power is widespread, there are countless examples of ruthless female rulers. Here are some more: 

Queen Mary I of England is literally called Bloody Mary because she executed every protestant in the country until there were only a few hundred left...she was that set on demonstrating her power and securing catholic favour.

Empress Wu Zetian of China would falsely accuse those who opposed her with treason, exile or execute them and even forced the accused to commit suicide. She poisoned or starved to death those of her rivals who she couldn’t eliminate otherwise. She is said to have strangled her infant daughter with her own hands in order to push her career forward.

Ranavalona I of Madagascar, her made it her kingdoms mission to repel European influence and Christianity in the region. She launched military campaigns in order to do so, but also in order to expand her empire, which resulted in the loss of millions of lives. She used forced labour and the introduction of a harsh judicial system against her own people in order to secure her power.

I feel as though they might fit into your ""dictator type,"" but honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. It seems as though it's not that you have a lack of examples, but rather a lack of willingness to see ""masculine"" traits in women. 

Edit: Also, I just want to point out that your argument is that ""even if society was egalitarian or matriarchial,"" yet you rest your entire argument on your own ability to name examples of females seizing power in patriarchal society. Would you mind providing some more analysis as to why you believe so that doesn't rely on examples?

&gt;* A Swiss court has reopened an investigation of alleged espionage activities by agents of the government of Kazakhstan against a high-profile political exile living in Switzerland.

&gt;* In 2008, a chartered airplane carrying Khrapunov and his wife landed in Switzerland, reportedly with a millions of dollars in cash, fine jewelry and antiques onboard.

&gt;* The case was closed in March of this year, after Swiss authorities said they did not have enough evidence to confirm the precise identity of the perpetrators, two of whom were reportedly holders of British passports.

&gt;* On Monday, however, the Federal Criminal Court in the Swiss city of Bellinzona ordered that the case be reopened, after allegations by Khrapunov that the espionage against him continues.

&gt;* Kazakh authorities have been regularly accused by European governments of conducting aggressive espionage and intimidation operations targeting exiled adversaries of President Nazarbayev.

Ruling class? I take it you're a Marxist - or at least sympathetic to Marxism - yourself then?

&gt; why did the ruling class not import more workers, like they're doing now? 

I can think of any number of reasons - cost effectivness, for one; lack of means of transport for another.

More importantly, many of the manufacturing jobs in those days required a much higher level of skill and training before mass automation so the workers were in demand because they were in short supply.

The demobilisation of millions of men with particular skills needing work for which there was high demand also meant there wasn't a great deal of need to look elsewhere. 

When globalisation was still in its infancy post WW II, no board of any company would have considered trying to attempt to train workers from foreign countries when they spoke little or no English and who at that time might well have been illiterate as well.

&gt; Why did they have protective tariffs, but none now?

Because the British Empire had been a thing and the US had to deal with that for one thing. Post WW II the political landscape shifted hugely, opening up potential markets in what had been former European colonies.

Also, you seem to be under the wholly mistaken impression that workers did not know how to fight for their rights until the guiding light of Marxism helped them to see it.

That is just incorrect.

The Revolutions of 1848 happened without the Communist Manifesto and the ideas Marx and Engels put forward were shared by many at the time. 

So in other words, they laid claim of ownership over movements that had absolutely nothing to do with them - something Marxists have been doing ever since - e.g. the protests against the invasion of Iraq were widely claimed as victories by Marxists and Marxist inspired groups despite the fact that they made up only a fraction of the protesters.

The Labour Party in the UK was very nearly called the Socialist Party but that was dropped at the last minute because they thought it would be off-putting to too many potential working class voters - not for fear of Communism, but for suspicions - often well-founded - of the rabble-rousing Marxist revolutionaries.

&gt; AFAIAC it’s quite non-controversial to say that, during the Cold War, the ruling elite was afraid of workers’ rebellion, and made sure the workers are happy.

I think it's highly tendentious if we're talking about the late 1940s, 1950s - as I was - and not the 1930s, as you seem to be.

In fact, I think it's highly disputable in any case. 

What is this 'ruling elite' are you talking about exactly? It sounds like a cartoon fantasy.

Also, firearms training is a comparatively small part of officer training here, so many cops aren't as comfortable using their weapon as your average recreational shooter would be. Still, they shot him in the legs in order to immobilize him. Not bad shooting for a bunch of pinky Europeans! ;)

As for this particular case: the perp was running amok in the streets, didn't comply with commands he received from the police, tried to assault the cops and then tried to run off. These are justifiable reasons for the use of deadly force in any jurisdiction.

Lets be very clear mass shootings do not occur in Europe ""ALL THE TIME"".

As an highly educated person, you should know that the use of ""all the time"" when talking about relatively rare events, compared to population and time scale is really quite, well, childish. things like mass shootings do not occur all the time, not weekly, or monthly, they occur on occasion at best (or worse, depending on your point of view).

You obviously misread my original comment, in your eagerness to trigger some sort of argument, so you could prove your highly educated and well traveled point of view.

So let me reiterate: **Which is probably why we dont have so many mass shootings.** you note that I in no way suggest that we have no mass shootings, or that we have no terrorist attacks. I say **less**.

However most of your examples do fall under the heading of ""terrorist attacks"" which, under no circumstance, can be related to the difference between US and European work hours.

So in comparison to the US (if you include Russia, which suits your argument) we are then looking at double the population of the US with far far less mass shootings and far less deaths. 

I might also add far less firearm/stress related suicides, 

the availability of weapons, is not really relevant to the argument.
IF you want a fire arm in Europe, they are available.

For example, take a Renault Mégane II (2001 - 2007). To replace a light bulb in your head light you can choose to do either of these two things:

1. Remove the entire fucking bumper, then remove the head light unit, also remove the battery because it is in the fucking way and then finally replace the broken light bulb, or;

2. Remove the wheel on the side where the light is broken, jack the car up, remove a cap in the front of the wheel thingy and then, by touch only, work your way to the head light unit and replace the broken light bulb. Again, all by touch only. You can not see shit.

Forget all the proxy war elements, proxy wars can only be ignited if there is fuel to begin with and part of the fuel was created by social conflicts arising from mass migration to the cities of Syria as the country dried up.

Essentially, Syria has to many people for to few resources and it created instability that could then be ignited.

WW1 and WW2 were massive wars created more or less by governments. Who says WW3 has to be the same? A more likely scenario is a conflict that goes out of control as those without resources seek to claim them. 

Not a war between two governments but between governments and people. Take Libya, what little government there is is trying to stop refugees but not succeeding. Already refugees fight police. Could they fight armies as well?

Here's my 2 cents on the build:

Liquid coolers are largely a luxury, and spending that money elsewhere generally provides a better return for your money. Plus, you won't have to worry about the horror scenario of liquid leaking all over the components. be quiet! pure rock is a solid cooler, widely available in Europe and I use it myself too.

You don't need ""Gaming"" in the mobo name, that word usually just brings a whole lot of extra to the price tag and not that much anywhere else. MSI Z170A SLI seems to be under £100 at the moment on ebuyer, which is a steal for that mobo. It doesn't support integrated graphics, but you likely won't need that for anything.

I would probably put that money saved on those two components on to a bigger SSD. Having your games on the SSD is nice for load times, and the £/GB ratio also usually goes down a bit when you increase the capacity. You don't need to get a Samsung, the cheaper ones, Sandisk for example, are good too.

A 1070 is a good choice, though you don't necessarily need to invest that much into the 1070. I paid 399€ for my 1070, it's a rather unknown ""KFA^2"" brand GPU that I bought from a german online store and it turned out good. That said, I've heard good things about the cooling on that MSI you have selected, so I wouldn't necessarily swap it out either. The pascal cards are rather hot

Case is a tad expensive, but if you want style and fancy stripes, I guess you gotta pay for it. I have a Fractal Design Define S which is much cheaper, though it lacks the red stripes.

The EVGA NEX, or G1 as its also known as, is good, but not the best. Also the 650W PSU is a tad big, I don't think you could go over 550W usage with that build even if you tried. So I would suggest you get the EVGA G2 550W, which is a very high quality PSU with a 10 year warranty, and should last with you through multiple builds.

Swapping the cooler, mobo, SSD and PSU brings us to this:

That leaves 50 pounds headroom to your listed budget. You could spend that by swapping out the be quiet! pure rock cooler to a Noctua NH-D15, which is one of the best air coolers on the market, and costs £50 more than the be quiet! pure rock. It's an extremely large cooler, but your case has plenty of room for it so that shouldn't be an issue. Also since it's an air cooler, it will last longer, while as liquid coolers have a shorter lifespan due to all the moving parts.

There are many values beyond what Stirner called morals, and those morals would more accurately be called deontology, the dominant ethical position of his day and ours (due to our Christianity). The deontological position is that men have a duty to obey objective moral rules - Stirner, Rand, and Nietzsche did not consider this to be the case. Nietzsche called himself the first immoralist because he considered the values of his Christian culture to be antithetical to life. Similarly, Ayn Rand called duty an anti-concept meant to annihilate the legitimate concept of causality - in her words there are no unchosen obligations and instead a legitimate ethical statement is a value free estimation of cause and effect.

These contrary philosophers nonetheless wrote within the context of a culture based on values from Christian, pagan, and classical cultures in which individualism, truth, freedom, and other terms have particular meanings.

t3_5af5og,1477991565,1481107315,d9glh4x,False,0,,t3_5af5og,"I think this situation has striking parallels with the onset of the Romanian Revolution in 1989.  From Wikipedia:

&gt;On the morning of 21 December Ceaușescu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timișoara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceaușescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now Piața Revoluției – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.[18]

&gt;In a speech laden with pro-socialist and Communist Party rhetoric, Ceaușescu delivered a litany of the achievements of the ""socialist revolution"" and Romanian ""multi-laterally developed socialist society"". He blamed the Timișoara uprising on ""fascist agitators"". However, Ceaușescu was out of touch with his people and completely misread the crowd's mood. The people remained unresponsive, and only the front rows supported Ceaușescu with cheers and applause. **About two minutes into the speech some in the crowd actually began to jeer, boo, whistle and yell insults at him, a reaction unthinkable for most of his rule.** Workers from a Bucharest power plant started chanting ""Ti-mi-șoa-ra! Ti-mi-șoa-ra!"", which was soon picked up by others in the crowd. In response, Ceaușescu raised his right hand in hopes of silencing the crowd; his stunned expression remains one of the defining moments of the end of communism in Eastern Europe. He then tried to placate the crowd by offering to raise workers' salaries by 100 lei per month (about 9 U.S. dollars at the time, yet a 5%–10% raise for a modest salary) and student scholarships from 100 to 110 lei while continuing to praise the achievements of the Socialist Revolution. However, a revolution was brewing right in front of his eyes.[18]

&gt;As Ceaușescu was addressing the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee building, sudden movement came from the outskirts of the massed assembly, as did the sound of (what various sources have reported as) fireworks, bombs or guns, which together caused the assembly to break into chaos. Initially frightened, the crowds tried to disperse. Bullhorns then began to spread the news that the Securitate was firing on the crowd and that a ""revolution"" was unfolding. This persuaded people in the assembly to join in. The rally turned into a protest demonstration.

&gt;The entire speech was being broadcast live around Romania, and it is estimated that perhaps 76% of the nation was watching.  Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceaușescu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realized that something unusual was in progress. Ceaușescu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; **Ceaușescu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.**

&gt;The jeers and whistles soon erupted into a riot; the crowd took to the streets, placing the capital, like Timișoara, in turmoil. Members of the crowd spontaneously began shouting anti-Ceaușescu slogans, which spread and became chants: ""Jos dictatorul!"" (""Down with the dictator""), ""Moarte criminalului!"" (**""Death to the criminal""**), ""Noi suntem poporul, jos cu dictatorul!"" (""We are the People, down with the dictator""), ""Ceaușescu cine ești?/Criminal din Scornicești"" (**""Ceaușescu, who are you? A criminal from Scornicești""**).

&gt;Protesters eventually flooded the downtown area, from Piața Kogălniceanu to Piața Unirii, Piața Rosetti and Piața Romană. In one notable scene from the event, a young man waved a tricolor with the Communist coat of arms torn out of its center while perched on the statue of Mihai Viteazul on Boulevard Mihail Kogălniceanu in the University Square. Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.

Because countries and people do in fact profit from it? As far as I remember EU citizens in the UK do in fact pay more in taxes than they get from the UK in health support etc. The UK does profit from them.

&gt; Democracy? Package deal? 

Yes. If you want to have a real democracy you have to have certain things. Free and equal elections. Basic rights. Etc. If you only take some of it, you can call it a democracy but it isn't one.

&gt; Why is there a tariff on those outside the union?

To protect the economic interest of those inside the union. For example there are anti-dumping tariffs on steel from China and Russia. That makes EU made steel more competitive in the EU. Now, if the UK leaves it will no longer profit from those tariffs.

&gt; Many of the policies seems to be contradictory in practice and directed at the specific purpose of political centralization

Politic centralization was from the begining something the EU was working towards. Although tariffs and free movement of people are not really part of that.

&gt;Right. But if you are one of the producers of steel and you can't produce steel at the same price as for example China, the tariffs make your steel more competitive and allow you to make profit. As far as I know the UK still has a steel industry. If imported steel is more expensive, people will buy EU steel which includes UK steel.

If your competitor (or not a competitor, doesn't really matter) sells steel at a loss--dumping it--then you can buy up underpriced steel and break the competitor and then you have steel you can sell at a higher price than you bought it for. It is not a genius plan to sell at a loss. If a South Korean company were to sell TVs at a loss to a european country, should the EU then put on a tariff on South Korean TVs?

While we were reasonably happy with how Fort and Zone of Control has played out since introduced over a year ago, it has had one major drawback. The rules have so many cases to keep track of that it was practically impossible to make all cases clear to the player. This causes much confusion amongst players, who also had an experience that was not as great as they had hoped while playing.

So now Zone of Control have changed completely. Instead of affecting a province and sometimes blocking passage in adjacent provinces, Zone of Control rules are now area based.

Areas = The same map division that States/Territories are organsied around. And which 1.19 will show thicker borders around.


A Forts is:
hostile if it is controlled by someone you are at war with.
friendly if it is controlled by you, or by someone on your side in any war, unless you are at war with them (should not happen).
neutral otherwise.


An area is:
friendly if it has at least one friendly fort and no hostile fort.
hostile if it has at least one hostile fort and no friendly fort.
contested if it has at least one hostile fort and at least one friendly fort.
neutral otherwise.

Zone of Control blocks an army to move between two adjacent provinces if they belong to different areas, one of which is hostile and the other being either hostile or contested.

(Note that movement within areas is never blocked by Zone of Control)

An occupied province without a fort will flip back to its owner's control if there is in the area at least one non-besieged fort controlled by him but no hostile forts.

To ensure an army can always reach the fort that is blocking it from moving and then come back after sieging it down, all armies can ignore Military Access in all non-neutral areas

Rebels never impact hostile rules, and yes, Capital Forts now work like all other forts.

In order to stop the enemy from reaching the interior of your country, you will often need to have one fort in every area.. Even without that though, forts can force the enemy to make detours unless they first siege down some forts.

While doing this, an average country ends up with more forts than before, so maintenance have been halved.

While doing these changes, we have tweaked the map dramatically, adding in lots of wastelands to give natural borders, and also made a big revision to the area setup, so now areas are pretty much all between 3-5 provinces, giving a more even balance.

[Smolensk contested area](http://forumcontent.paradoxplaza.com/public/203374/eu4_131.png)

We have added a new peace treaty as well in 1.19, called “End Rivalry”. This peace option force the enemy to remove one of their Rivals. The removed Rival cannot be added again until 15 years after removed.


We play the game quite a lot every week, and read far more on what issues you as players have. So we keep balancing and changing things to make for a greater player experience. In 1.19 we have some rather important changes to how you play the game.

Combat has been changed a bit as well in this patch, as *we removed the combat width penalties from terrain*, as it made battles last way too long, and was a double defensive bonus combined with diceroll penalties.

Sieging units will no longer get a rivercrossing penalty if a relieving force engages them, even if they did cross a river a few days, months or years earlier.

We have changed the chance to increase colonysize from colonist being placed to instead being a lower the bigger the colony becomes. Previously it was pretty much a no-brainer to keep it as long as possible, as it became better the bigger the colony is. Now íts more of a choice..

Another complaint was the fixed levels of liberty desire that got applied to vassals and marches as they grew past certain arbitrary limits. Now it is scaling by development of the subject so you can always judge impact of their growth.

For those of you that care about score, Great Powers are now likelier to be getting score each month, as they have a default +5 rating in each category. Also maintaining enough forts is now an impact on your military score gain.

Corruption is now not entirely 100% bad, as a country with 100 corruption will now get -20 unrest in their realm. ''note from me:WTF''

Courthouse &amp; Town Halls no longer affect unrest but instead reduce state maintainance by 25% and 50% respectively, while their building costs have been halved.

The Casus Belli from Expansion and Exploration Ideagroups did not really work as great as before with the new technology system, so in 1.19 they are getting changed. The Casus Belli themselves are gone..

Exploration Finisher now allows you to fabricate claim on another continent that is in your capital in a colonial region. (Colonial Subjects can do it everywhere in a colonial region.)

Expansion Finisher now allows you to fabricate claims inside any trade company region that is on another continent than your capital. (Without Wealth of Nations, it is any overseas port not in a colonial region, and not in europe.)

At the same time, distance impact on building spy networks have been dropped to 1/10th of before.

For those of you that have Rights of Man, we are now adding even more things. In 1.19, Trade Goods will have a local impact. A Grain Province gives +0.5 Land Force Limit, Iron gives 20% Faster Building Construction &amp; Ivory gives 20% cheaper state maintenance.

We have also improved the “trading in good” - bonus, where some are almost twice as powerful as before, and some have changed completely.

Next week we'll be back talking about all interface improvements for 1.19.

&gt; Testament was one of the first thrash metal bands to emerge from the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1980s. Originally formed as 'Legacy' in 1983 by founding members Eric Peterson (rhythm guitar), Derrick Ramirez (guitar) and Louie Clemente (drums), the line-up included vocalist Steve Souza and Greg Christian (bass). Ramirez was later replaced by wunderkind Alex Skolnick (lead guitar). Souza soon departed to join Exodus and suggested that the towering Chuck Billy take over as frontman(and was later run over by a bus). The band became known as 'Testament' 3 years later, while recording their debut album in Ithaca, New York.

&gt; ""The Legacy"" was a brutal intro in 1987, putting Testament at the forefront of the flourishing thrash metal scene. Following ""Live At Eindhoven"", an EP recorded at Holland's Dynamo Festival, ""The New Order"" in 1988 was well received producing one of the band's most memorable classics ""Disciples Of The Watch"". Next came the highly successful ""Practice What You Preach"" in 1989, then the release of ""Souls Of Black"" in 1990, coinciding with the European 'Clash Of The Titans' tour with Slayer, Megadeth and Suicidal Tendencies.

&gt; After ""The Ritual"" in 1992, Skolnick, who was losing interest in pure metal, decided to pursue his interest in jazz and left the band. Clemente also departed. ""Return To Apocalyptic City"" in 1993 brought Glen Alvelais (guitar, ex- Forbidden) into the fold, and filling in temporarily for Clemente, Paul Bostaph (ex- Forbidden, Slayer). James Murphy (ex- Death, Obituary, Disincarnate, Cancer) soon stepped in for Alvelais on lead duties for ""Low"" in 1994, as John Tempesta (ex- Exodus) took over on the drums. Tempesta later left to join White Zombie, and was replaced by John Dette (ex- Evil Dead ). ""Live At The Fillmore"" was released in 1995, then Dette left in 1996 to join Slayer. ""The Best Of Testament"" was released in 1996.

&gt; ""Demonic"", which was recorded in Testament's Driftwood Studios, was released in 1997. James Murphy and Greg Christian having left the band were replaced by alumni Glen Alvelais and Derrick Ramirez (bass). Gene Hoglan (drums, ex- Death, Dark Angel) lent his percussion talents. ""Signs Of Chaos"", a 'best of' disc of the band, was released in 1997.

&gt; Dave Lombardo (ex- Slayer, Grip, Inc.) was officially introduced into the band. James Murphy was brought back once again, and on bass, the legendary Steve DiGiorgio (ex- Death, Control Denied, Sadus). ""The Gathering"" was born in 1999. James Murphy abruptly departed, which was determined later for reasons due to a serious illness. Steve Smyth (ex-Vicious Rumors) jumped aboard as 'touring guitarist', later to be invited to stay on as a permanent member. Lombardo soon also left, not being able to commit, having other projects on his plate. In 2000, Jon Allen (drums, ex- Sadus) joined the band.

&gt; After the successful ""Riding The Snake"" world tour to promote ""The Gathering"", vocalist Billy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called 'germ cell seminoma' in March 2001. Despite his illness and grueling cancer treatments, Billy offered his ground shaking vocals to the re-recording of Testament classics on ""First Strike Still Deadly"" with a reunion of sorts, bringing back Alex Skolnick and John Tempesta to record on the disc.

&gt; The Formation of Damnation is the confirmed title for Testament's ninth studio album, which will be released on April 29, 2008. It is going to be the first album that Testament has released since 1999's The Gathering, although the band re-recorded some of their early material for 2001's First Strike Still Deadly. This will also be Testament's first release with original guitarist Alex Skolnick since 1992's The Ritual and bassist Greg Christian since 1994's Low.
Chuck Billy has since fully recovered. A busy touring schedule of the U.S. and Europe commenced in late 2002, through the summer of 2003. In 2004, guitarist Steve Smyth left the band to join Nevermore, and ""Metal Mike"" Chlasciak stepped in.

1. Simple pure gameplay, Battlefield has always pushed for unique character models for each class so they are quickly and easily identifiable(and more so post Bad company). This has included using ethnicity to single out a specific class on a number of occasions in the past. Dice want it that players can easily spot and identify a class without the need to press Q for the overlay. They have always pushed this and BF1 is no different. Dice have also always been somewhat reluctant to allow model customisation in Battlefield games for the same reason, they allow camo changes in BF3/BF4 but no customizable changes to the model.


2. Reflect the range of theatres available. The nation with the most diversity in terms of classes is the UK. They are also the nation with the most theatres of war currently in the game, they fight both in the middle east and in europe.  Becuase of reason 1 Dice have not made it that the army has a unique make up for each theatre so instead much in the same notion as your mp 18 point they opted to represent all theatres in the single line up. Hence the UK has more diversity then the other nations because the middle eastern campaign involved a much larger colonial force then the western front and technically the UK has in the game at the moment more battles in the middle east then it does in western europe (3 vs 2)

This is sort of backed up by the fact no attempt at diversity was made with the Italian or Austrian Hungary forces because there is only one theatre (Italian front) covered with them. And its not that italy didnt have access to colonial troops during the period, they ruled Libya at this point.

Americans have a black soldier due to the harlem hellfighters

Which brings us to the german scout which obviously goes against this, except we know one of the DLCS is going to be Russia, which if its Russia vs Germany then as you already stated yourself there was evidence of black soldiers on that front. Or it could be a hint that a later DLC will include East African campaign perhaps.

5	Trump has hired radical media people to develop a new fascist cable channel.

7	America is not aware of what is going on, the KGB is clever. 

8	Trump followers are arming themselves and are not concerned with what trump does or says – the signs of dictator worship. 

9	Trump is not interested in the presidency, only in strengthening and further radicalizing his followers. 
 
10	Trump’s actions in the debate confirms the above. 

11	Unless America catches on soon, they will be separated and overrun by the fascists.  

12	Trump is following Putin’s playbook. Make no doubt about it. 

13	The comment sections of American articles are flooded with Russian trollers.
 
14	Putin is hacking our election and national committee data bases  

15	Trump reinforces anger and hatred. 

16	Trump is trying to delegitimize the press. 

17	Trump would give putin a green light to take over Europe. 

18	Trump justifies violence, “My people will riot in the streets” “I’d like to punch him in the face.” 

19	The dictator’s goons and gangs will rough up and threaten anyone who dare oppose him. 

20	People will cower against these gangs. 

21	America will be overrun to the point of a civil war. 

22	Trump will become our dictator. Don’t kid yourself, trump is no longer out for money – only raw power.

Crave power. No self-respecting despot comes to power without having some sort of desire for power in the first place. Once the desire for power is implanted, it leads to developing a plan to get that power, and then to developing a plan to get more power. 


Become self-centered. Josef “Man of Steel” Stalin and Saddam Hussein were noted for their narcissistic behavior, as were many other strongmen throughout history. To be an effective dictator, you have to love yourself, because you can’t be sure anyone else will.  Getting your first taste of power helps you detach yourself emotionally from your future subjects. Studies published in the magazine ‘’Psychological Science’’ in 2006 and 2010 show that people who thought of themselves as well-off became more self-centered and less able to see things from others’ point of view.

Not just Obama: previous presidents have an almost quiet view regarding the inner politics of the EU. They seem to have no concrete view regarding on what the EU should be.

It requires a lot less explanation than ""equal rights for women"" (saying that is also often an invite to be trolled) view of the role of the state (which is a bad example, because although we are closer to the US, our views still differs significantly from the average American citizen) then there's the fact that as a country that is borderline bilingual we consume mostly American media, but that only highlights why we would feel close to the US, not why would automatically mistrust Russia. Then there's the territorial aspect, Russia has occupied part of my country before, but I don't think a lot of Danes even know that, so the point is moot. Then there's the fact that in Europe there's a feeling that Russia wants to expand and as a country not completely out of reach (and located a place that is strategically important for both nations) should cause most to be a little alarmed and has caused us to be historically pro US, especially because the threat of US intervention is a safe guard against that (I hope) but again, I don't want to be drowned in 1) Russia isn't doing anything wrong!

This supposed legal professional

- refuses to state who he actually is. Good luck finding someone in Europe with just R. Gulich Advocat. AFAIK Advocat is a word for lawyer only in Catalunya (don't quote me on that though, not a language expert).

- strongarms into here accusing ""this sub"" (not a legal entity by any means) of supporting sexual assault. On the surface this is a fairly strong statement, but with no actual legal implications. As such it seems designed simply to create a response, which it has.

- Has not yet stated any sources for any of his claims. One time he [has referenced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prague/comments/5a1j06/this_sub_supports_sexual_assault/d9fwc3s/) ""§184 of 40/2009"", which he blatantly copied form a [previously posted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prague/comments/5a1j06/this_sub_supports_sexual_assault/d9f567l/). Due to his claim he's not a Czech lawyer and not in Czech Rep. at all, it is difficult to imagine he understands that law. Neither his notion of what is legal, nor his accusations of ""this sub"" ""supporting sexual assault"" has any footing in actual law, as far as I can tell - and he has yet to prove me otherwise. He hasn't even posted even a direct link to the previously deleted post about Smith's Pies, so for all we know this is just a setup for ""haha trolled you I was actually talking about blahblaawhatever""

- [His accusations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prague/comments/5a1j06/this_sub_supports_sexual_assault/d9cyuff/) that the mod here is a friend of the accused, all the while requesting his contact information - how would he know the mod is a friend of anyone if he doesn't know who he is? 

- spends his time on reddit (hours at a time), and not just that - has referenced the Boston bombing debacle, which means he's most likely used reddit for some time, and yet has completely unreasonable claims as to how reddit and individual subreddits work. 

- is offended by ""gendering""

None of these individually are direct proof of him not being who he says he is, but overall I think the picture is clear enough for me. Admittedly perhaps not clear enough for a court (or even /r/karmacourt), but sufficient for me.

This year, the two British have dominated Europe in the CoD World League under the Millenium standard and have performed well against the North Americans ogres.

Currently teaming with Momentus (UK), Wailers (FR) would be part of the adventure of the CoD World League in 2017 but the British could be replaced.
Indeed, Gotaga would be titular again within the team.
The four would be composed of Wailers, Gotaga, Tommey and Swanny, a dual French / British duo that could wreak havoc on the Old Continent. Sources close to the writing come also support this thesis.

The probable composition :

- (FR) Wailers ""Wailers"" Locart
- (FR) Corentin ""Gotaga"" Houssein
- (UK) Tom ""Tommey"" Trewen
- (UK) Callum ""Swanny"" Swan

You're quite delusional about WW2.  The German economy didn't return to WW1 levels of industrial output until they'd conquered half of Europe and they were using mass slavery to work the factories.

I went and I found it quite good although i missed maybe the 15ish first minutes of introduction because I didn't know you had to pay, i was out of cash and had to go see mr. Fainé. Anyways, when i arrived the moderator was introducing the metaphor of a half empty/half full pint of beer and asked the 3 analysts to express their gut feeling about the proçés. I don't recall exactly but i belive it was one neutral, two positive. That shocked me because from what i get in my circles is a feeling of a little stagnation; and that positive perspective made me realize how circlejerky can public opinion get; especially if the inner party politics (#PressingCUP et al.) get 24h. coverage.

The event carried out like this: the host showed a news web-piece of an international publication, and then the analysts would add some insight about the evolution of the tone, treatment and international opinion of some publications in general and also from a national perspective (US, Germany,...). Also explained how the catalan issue and catalonia's recongintion in the world kinda exposure still needed time to reach internet critical mass. In a way, only just recently (10ish years) catalonia is staring to get know to the anglospeaking news sphere, just because beforehand there wasn't a need for translating newsworthy events (happening in catalonia) to english and when those did get to the outside, they would usually come from the sources in madrid, arguably a different take on a news story than it would be if given from the actual source in Catalunya. Due to economically sensible reasons, it makes sense to use the journalistic human resources in madrid to cover the entire country and sometimes the entire peninsula. Another thing they discussed was the evolution in the semantics used by cat. politicians and how it sometimes had undesired effects when translated to other languages and the concept misunderstood. Things like ""xoc de trens"" might not be the optimal choice of words. They agreed that the judicialization of the proçés would surely be significant in the near future; especially when taking into account the possibility of recourse the the european courts of justice. There were many details I can't recall right now. Following the news articles and the exposition of the different national perspectives, the qandA started but i felt they were a little bit too long and in a sense a little tad proselytizing, and i felt like a little of a missed opportunity to ask some things, but the level of the forum never suffered. 

Anyways, that opportunity to engage with the experts central of the event came later in the postevent networking pica-pica (2 beers,  Croquetes i patates braves). I met some lurker redditors (i summon you :) ) and nice chat was had. 

Overall, really interesting! Super insightful when we chatted with Krystyna about the perceived need for external (international) attention especially when taken into consideration the paceful and participative entity of this movement.

Side note; to those accusing this chat of beeing ""
&gt; ""How non-Catalan supporters of Catalan Independence see Catalan Independence"""" 

let the record show that the host addressed this issue by summoning anyone from the Against Independence side to have priority in the QandA. So, the principle of [Audi alteram partem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_alteram_partem) (principio contradictorio en el ordenamiento jurídico esp.) was thoroughly preserved. If none of them happened to show up; welp, i can't see what more can be done to engage them in civil discussion...

Goa for one was a Portuguese colony. We tried dealing with Portugal at the UN level but they refused unlike Hong Kong which had 100 year contract. There was an actual independence movement there since self rule wasn't even allowed unlike Crimea which was autonomous. 

Sikkim was a British protectorate which was handed over to India after independence. No one died in Sikkim (relatively bloodless compared to Crimea) when India annexed it. The region has various provisions that protect them, there is self rule. Most Indians aren't allowed to purchase land or settle there without special permission. What India did in Sikkim was subtle unlike Russia. There is no resistance movement. Hell, if we didn't annex it, China would have immediately, China did try to invade it twice and failed. 
You can compare Sikkim to Bhutan, India has not tried to annex Bhutan. Yes, we have a lot of influence on their dealing with China but the rest I believe they are mostly free to do as they want. A Bhutanese will have to correct me if I am wrong here. 

Whatever Russia's reasons to annex Crimea, there could have been a better way to handle it without the unnecessary loss of life. I do agree EU and U.S. Did meddle in that situation, how much? I don't know. What is certain that Putin did not handle it properly and gave Eu and U.S. More cards. 

IMO, it's best to stay out of it since it doesn't concern us. On the humanitarian question, Russia needs to ensure stability and end the violence.

t3_5afsn4,1478006904,1481111057,d9gr9hw,False,0,,t3_5afsn4,"John Dee is not a specialty of mine, but in general, alchemy and astrology were considered in line with other ""practical sciences"" (like mathematics and engineering) up until the late ""Scientific Revolution."" That is, they weren't magic or witchcraft, they were ""naturalistic"" understandings of the supernatural (God). They were also, in the European context, closely aligned with imagined ideas about Judeo-Christianity, going back to Solomon or Moses in the alchemists' bizarre (but widely-held) understanding of their craft. They saw themselves as understanding the nature of the universe, as hidden by God in scripture and the fabric of the cosmos itself. 

The people who practices such things were often of a rather higher class as well, which doesn't hurt. These are often people who, if not actual courtiers themselves, then served courtiers. 

This doesn't mean it was universally tolerated. Henry IV passed a law banning alchemy, for example, though it was practiced both under some official capabilities and in secret until Charles II (a closet alchemist) repealed the law (at the admonition of Robert Boyle). Henry VIII apparently attempted to use alchemists at the Royal Mint, but Elizabeth only approved a few official alchemists.

So while the fortunes of alchemists could wax and wane, and there were certainly those who would have thought the whole thing stunk of black magic, on the whole alchemists and astrologers were pretty well tolerated as ""experts"" of a practical sort. Today we see them as pseudoscientists at best, charlatans and ""magicians"" at worst, but the boundaries between the ""real"" sciences and the ""pseudo"" sciences were very porous up until the late 18th century or so. (Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle were both alchemists; the generation after them spent more time policing the boundary between alchemy and chemistry.) 

We can contrast this with the idea of witches, which are people in this mindset who have made a pact with Satan to do bad things to no particular end. These are outsiders, these are people who are not part of the state hierarchy, they are seen as dabbling with truly supernatural forces, not appealing to special knowledge from God.

We were always communicating talking and both very loving and caring people towards each other. Last year we kept our relationship in a very long distance as he was in NY and I in europe. We got back together in summer and our love got bigger and even stronger. However he had to go this august back in ny for school. I would go there too but things didn't gi that well so we planned to be together studying in canada next year. By early October, he has been very busy with school work and other problems and we haven't been able to talk with each other like we used to do.
I believe also based on his past because he has suffered from depression, that he is suffering now too. Two weeks ago he shocked me by telling me he didn't know what he felt anymore and if he loved me just as a friend. He asked me time and I said i would give him time. After some love and sweet messages, he has blocked me on social media or won't respond me. Even when iask him if its overbetween us. No matter what, I still love him and care for him so much. And I can't give up on him. Recently a mutual friend told me that he looked sad and pretty silent. The only thing he had told him about us was thatthings were not that good.

Incarceration rates in the US are falling, sometimes very shapely. Drug incarcerations are at pre-Nixon levels where I live due to a decriminalization effort. But even nationally they are falling as well. 

That said, there are some violent people that have been arrested many times that will only get a slap on the wrist. I was recently talking to a Chicago cop that arrested two people for carrying illegal firearms (who were almost certainly felons) who was hopeful they will be off the street for ""a couple months"". A man who was sentenced to jail over 20 times often for violent crimes, for a cumulative of almost 100 years, was released early 15 times. He robbed an elderly woman in a walker. A man who gained international attention earlier this summer for being shot while streaming on Facebook Live was convicted of murder in 2009 but was already out. He was shot again and killed this past weekend (keep in mind every time one if these loser gang bangers is shot it costs the city $60,000+ in medical costs). A man that was convicted of 4 felony firearms charges was not only released but was given a $2100 luxury high rise apartment courtesy of taxpayers. He shot and killed his neighbor when his neighbor asked him ti stop sexually harassing his girlfriend. 

Some people are shitty and deserve to be in prison. No amount of welfare money or benefits you throw at them will change that. As someone from a city that has tried this approach for a long time I can tell you it doesnt work. It is unfortunate to see European cities making the same mistakes under the same banner of ""compassion"". The legislation I was talking about was from New York. It gave mandatory minimums for repeat firearms offenses and has played a large role in reducing crime there.  But at least we are not ""racist"" by refusing to punish people regardless of race for their violent crimes. New York who took the opposite approach, and has mandatory minimums for firearm crimes, now has a significantly lower homicide rate than Amsterdam. ",False,0,europe,,-1,mkvgtired,,t5_2qh4j

&gt; In 2005 Karate announced their demise, quietly closing the door on a 12-year run that included 6 studio albums and almost 700 performances in 20 countries. They exited the indie rock world without much fanfare, except from the small enclaves of devout fans who have followed their music since Geoff Farina's early 90's work with The Secret Stars. The band’s beginnings in the early-90's Boston indie scene, their love for improvised music and classic rock, and their adherence to the DIY punk ethos of their youth made them freaks in any scene, defying classification with their strange fusion of punk, blues, jazz and rock.

&gt; The band was formed in 1993 by Geoff Farina, Eamonn Vitt and Gavin McCarthy. In 1995, Jeff Goddard joined the band as bass player, and Vitt moved to second guitar. Vitt departed Karate to pursue a medical career in 1997.

&gt; Karate’s perfectionism and attention to detail belied the off-the-cuff ethos of the indie rock world, and some considered them to be as un-punk as it gets. But fans would say that their auto-didactic music studies, compulsive control of their song arrangements, ascetic studio values, and Geoff’s work modifying old tube amplifiers and creating original album artwork, was pure DIY. Karate was even compulsive about naming this recording, which was originally called ""594” since it was believed to be a recording of their 594th show, according to “The Showlist.” Culled mostly from Jeff Goddard’s elephantine memory, The Showlist is a mammoth list of Karate’s 695 shows, complete with dates, venues, support bands, and even the specific tour vehicle used to get to each show. But when Gavin recently discovered a flyer for a forgotten early show that had somehow evaded Jeff’s memory, the band quickly changed the title to '595'.

&gt; The early incarnation of Karate included Eamonn Vitt on bass and guitar, and when Jeff Goddard joined early on, they recorded In Place of Real Insight as a four-piece. When Eamonn left to pursue medical school, the lineup stabilized and remained a trio until their 2005 demise. Karate also built up a close-knit community of collaborators who shared their same no-nonsense values, including Tape Op tech guru Andy Hong who engineered most of their studio albums, Flower Booking’s Mahmood Shaikh who booked the band for over a decade, and tour manager / live sound engineer Greet Vyvey who traveled with the band on all their European tours.

&gt; Since the band's breakup, Jeff and Gavin recorded a bass / drums project called Possible Path, and Gavin began drumming for the legendary Boston psych-rock band Cul De Sac. Geoff and Gavin have a new band called Glorytellers that also features Josh Larue (Mice Parade, Him, The Sorts ) on electric guitar. Geoff is currently working on a new solo release for Southern Records, a recording of pre-War blues songs with Chris Brokaw (Codeine, Pullman, The New Year), and recently appeared on an all-covers record called Guilt by Association with Devendra Banhart, Mike Watt, Will Oldham, Petra Haden, Mark Mulcahy, Jim O'Rourke, and other great performers.

*Because it the first for a lot. The United States of America is the best country in the world because it is the most stable unified countries on earth.

I think the USA is the only superpower for a reason, because we the US are a mixture of everyone from every nation. There is no true americans because we all came from somewhere else, even natives. Overall the US is the greatest nation because we are in charge of a lot of things and have a good constitution that's not fake.

Was genau willst du dann sonst suggerieren wenn du Link/Beispiellisten postest oder Sachen postest wie ""Young Afghan men are a highly problematic demographic group.""? 

Oder willst du stattdessen suggerieren die Polizei tut nicht genug? 

&gt;Österreichische Staatsbürger und EU Bürger dürfen sich in Österreich niederlassen. 

Serben und Türken sind beides keine EU Bürger. Warum sollten sie anders beurteilt werden als Afghanen und Marrokaner? 

&gt;Es ist kein Menschenrecht für Marokkaner sich in Innsbruck niederlassen zu dürfen.

Mir ist nicht ganz klar in welchem Konzept wir jetzt reden? Geht es um Asyl oder um normales Niederlassen? Leute aus allen möglichen Nicht-EU Ländern (ob jetzt Marokko, USA, Japan oder Russland) haben sicher nicht das Menschenrecht, aber in verschiedenen Szenarien die Möglichkeit sich in Österreich niederzulassen, zb Rot-Weiß-Rot Karte, Heirat, besonders schön Opern singen. 

Geht es um Asyl? Da gibt es ohnehin schon unterschiedliche gesetzliche Regelungen die das Ablehnen von Asyl regeln im Fall von Straftaten. Und dass Abschiebung schlecht geht/dass das Ziel Kriminelle abzuschieben ist auch in der Mainstreampolitik ziemlich in agreement (Spontan fallen mir da Zitate von Kern, Doskozil und Häupl ein die das alle bejaen). 

Was ist dein Vorschlag was mit so einer ""highly problematic demographic group"" tun soll? Besser aufteilen? Mehr gesondert unterbringen? Soll man schneller Schubhaft verhängen? Soll es mehr Alkoholverbote und Ausgehsperren in Asylunterkünften geben (würde nur Asylwerber betreffen)? Soll Mindestsicherung an Alkoholverbot und Ausgehsperren geknüft sein (für die die einen Positivbescheid bekommen haben)? Soll man sie im vorhinein nicht reinlassen?

Crisis in the group due to 2 males fighting over a woman? Crisis due to fire originating from lighting? Crisis due to drought? We blamed a ""higher power"" for them. So either we ritualized them, for example only allowed fighting amongst men (to impress the females) in a ritual fighting, as still can be seen amongst African tribes. 

That or we scapegoated one of the 2 men, and killed them. Since the crisis in the tribe went away every time one of them was killed, it must be ""god's will"" and the only way to solve it. Hence you get the human sacrifices in primitive religions.

What is important is that at the core of all of this is our instinctual mimetic desire, a side effect from our bigger evolved brain. By evolving bigger mimetic capacities, we grew better in learning and teaching and operating together. But sadly we don't only have the instinct to copy movements and behavior, but also desires. This can most easily be seen amongst little children and babies. They can be neglecting a toy, but as soon as you or someone else starts playing with it, they *must* have it. 

With this established, as the millennia passed by, these primitive religions evolved into the religions we find in ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Egypt. (for example the ancient olympics is nothing more that ritualized violence) 

And then we start getting intelligent people that see through these psychological pathways. And they start telling us that when we are angry at a person, we have to blame ourselves, because most likely we're angry because of jealousy fueled by a hidden instinctual mimetic desire. 

It's most likely not because of their rise to popularity that your friend in high-school changed and isn't part of your group anymore. But the jealousy in your group of friends towards mentioned popularity is, and the easiest way to end the growing tension in the group is by expelling the 'cause' of said tension, aka your friend. 

Christianity is simply one of the many modern religions that formed around one of those early intelectuals aka *prohets*. I live my life being aware of my instinctual scapegoating and try to self-reflect as often as I can. Basically I live a christian life, no wonder, I was raised in Europe as a Christian.

Anyway here's what most catches by ear/eye for the week ending Tuesday November 1:

PICKS OF THE WEEK:

* To Green Angel Tower: Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, Book 3 By Tad Williams, Narrated By Andrew Wincott -- This! Actually! Includes! Both parts of what is usually released in two parts both in print and audio, the US release FINALLY of the concluding book of Tad's decade- and genre-definiting epic fantasy series. 63 hours for one credit, people. You've got enough time to read (or re-read for the first time in years) before Tad's long-awaited return to Osten Ard next year.

* The Weaver By Emmi Itäranta, Narrated By Aysha Kala for Harper -- ""The author of the critically acclaimed Memory of Water returns with this literary ecological tale in the vein of Ursula K. Le Guin and Sheri S. Tepper, in which an innocent young woman becomes entangled in a web of ancient secrets and deadly lies that lie at the dark center of her prosperous island world.""

* Fallen Dragon By Peter F. Hamilton, Narrated By John Lee for Tantor -- ""In the distant future, corporations have become sustainable communities with their own militaries, and corporate goals have essentially replaced political ideology. On a youthful, rebellious impulse, Lawrence joined the military of a corporation that he now recognizes to be ruthless and exploitative. His only hope for escape is to earn enough money to buy his place in a better corporation. When his platoon is sent to a distant colony to quell a local resistance effort, it seems like a stroke of amazing fortune, and Lawrence plans to rob the colony of their fabled gemstone, the Fallen Dragon, to get the money he needs.""

* The Chimes by Anna Smaill, narrated by Luke Kempner for Quercus -- Debut novel from this New Zealand writer which literally *just* won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel: ""After the end of a brutal civil war, London is divided, with slums standing next to a walled city of elites. Monk-like masters are selected for special schooling and shut away for decades, learning to write beautiful compositions for the chimes, played citywide morning and night, to mute memory and keep the citizens trapped in ignorance. A young orphan named Simon arrives in London with nothing but the vague sense of a half-forgotten promise to locate someone. What he finds is a new family - a gang of scavengers that patrols the underbelly of the city looking for valuable metal to sell. Drawn in by an enigmatic and charismatic leader, a blind young man named Lucien with a gift for song, Simon forgets entirely what originally brought him to the place he has now made his home.""

* Willful Child: Wrath of Betty: Willful Child, Book 2 By Steven Erikson, Narrated By MacLeod Andrews -- Legendary epic fantasist Erikson (Malazan Book of the Fallen) returns to his dark humor sci-fi series.

* The White City By Simon Morden, Narrated By Thomas Judd for Orion, Book 2 of ""Down"" after 2016's *Down Station* -- ""Since escaping London's inferno, Mary and Dalip have fought monsters and won - though in the magical world of Down, the most frightening monsters come from within. Now they hold the greatest of treasures: maps that reveal the way to the White City, where they can find the answers they're looking for and learn the secrets of Down. But to get there they must rely on Crows, who has already betrayed them at every turn.""

* Shadowed Souls By Jim Butcher - editor, Kerrie L. Hughes - editor, Narrated By Jim Butcher, Julia Whelan, Various -- Series: The Dresden Files, Book 14.5 -- Can't get enough Dresden? Here's a shared world anthology for you.

* **Teen:** The Diabolic By S. J. Kincaid, Narrated By Candace Thaxton -- ""Red Queen meets The Hunger Games in this epic novel about what happens when the galaxy's most deadly weapon masquerades as a senator's daughter and a hostage of the galactic court.""

* **Fiction:** All That Man Is By David Szalay, Narrated By Sean Barrett, Mark Meadows, Huw Parmenter -- A Man Booker Prize finalist this year: ""Nine men. Each of them at a different stage in life, each of them away from home, and each of them striving - in the suburbs of Prague, in an overdeveloped Alpine village, beside a Belgian motorway, in a dingy Cyprus hotel - to understand what it means to be alive here and now. Tracing a dramatic arc from the spring of youth to the winter of old age, the ostensibly separate narratives of All That Man Is aggregate into a picture of a single shared existence, a picture that interrogates the state of modern manhood while bringing to life, unforgettably, the physical and emotional terrain of an increasingly globalized Europe. And so these nine lives form an ingenious and new kind of novel in which David Szalay expertly plots a dark predicament for the 21st-century man.""

* **Fiction:** Faithful: A Novel By Alice Hoffman, Narrated By Amber Tamblyn -- ""Growing up on Long Island, Shelby Richmond is an ordinary girl until one night an extraordinary tragedy changes her fate. Her best friend's future is destroyed in an accident while Shelby walks away with the burden of guilt.""

* **Teen fiction:** The Sun Is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, read by a full cast -- ""I'm a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I'm definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is 12 hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won't be my story.""

INDIE PICKS:

* Uriel's Fall: Ubiquity, Book 1 By Loralie Hall, Narrated By Leanna Abbott for Crossroad Press -- ""What's a corporate demon to do when the voice in her head is devouring her sanity from the inside out, and the hosts of heaven and hell would rather see her destroyed than surrender a power no one should possess?""

* Surrender the Sun by A R. Shaw, narrated by Kevin Pierce -- ""In the year 2030 the Maunder Minimum, a period of solar inactivity, will cause a mini-ice age like it did between the years 1645 and 1710. When it does, Bishop will have to save her not only from the effects of severe weather but also from man himself.""

* Wild and Wishful, Dark and Dreaming: The Worlds of Alethea Kontis By Alethea Kontis, Narrated By Alethea Kontis and Kate Baker

* Code Breakers: Alpha By Colin F. Barnes, Narrated By Marc Vietor for Audible -- No, Audible's not an indie audiobook publisher by any means, but! Barnes is published by tiny micro ""Binary Books"" and the [Kindle edition](http://amzn.to/2fdqkmh) has often been free or (as it is today) $0.99, making this an incredibly inexpensive Whispersync pickup ($1.99 add-on price). Code Breakers: Beta, Code Breakers: Gamma, and Code Breakers: Delta are also all released this week (with tiny Whispersync deal prices) along with the aptly named prequel Code Breakers: Prequel.

* Rune of the Apprentice by Jamison Stone, narrated by Kevin T. Collins for Audible -- ""In a world where magic, technology, and nature have merged, the few who can control Runes hold dominance over all of creation. All believe that Aleksi, a 16-year-old orphan, was blessed to be born with a Rune embedded in his palm, but that's only because they don't know the truth - Aleksi's Rune is so powerful it's killing him.""

&gt; Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passen
core rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy
isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war

Yes, an intimidating mishmash, but once you get into the rhythm of Joyce's puns, it more less comes together: 

Violer d'amores = the musical instrument viol d'amore, combined with the sense of a ""violator"" of love. 

Passencore = passenger and ""pas encore"" - not again. Combined with ""rearrived"" works with the general cyclic theme of the whole novel - things happening again for the first time.

Amorica = love again. Sir Tristram (Wagner's Tristan + Tristram Shandy?) has been having himself a good time over the pond.

weilderfight = wield + fight, but also weil der fight - weil being german for villa or, roughly, place. 

penisolate war = reference to the Peninsular War, but also, of course, penis + isolate, and perhaps pen + is + isolate. 

Translation: Sir Tristram - tragic hero? Cassanova figure? buffoon? - arrives fresh from the New World to teach us all a thing or two about love - and fucking.

WWI has no clear bad side for me, it was started by germany an austro-hungaria, but i think it was doomed to happen, as european countries all desired power. So im just a bid sad that germans in BF1 are just shootable things with some voice lines, not having a singleplayer story. The worst part are the conversations between germans in the the singleplayer. If you translaste their conversations, you get some dumb, aggressively blabbering soldiers, and thats just sad.
In multiplayer on the other side i think its fine. The voice lines have a fitting feel to them, a complete contrast to the singleplayer.

WWII is a completely different story to me. I learned frrom the ground up that the nazi regime outright evil and so its easy to not have sympathy with virtual WWII german soldiers. I never changed my mind about that and think the denial of the holocaust by someone is disgusting.

But hey; [look at this](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2013/health-expenditure-per-capita_health_glance-2013-64-en), for instance, in which private and public healthcare systems are examined, and private ones are found to be by far the most expensive. (The US costs around double the UK per capita.) Alternatively you could go the new route: e.g. [this,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/nhs/11748960/The-PFI-hospitals-costing-NHS-2bn-every-year.html) [this,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/29/pfi-crippling-nhs) or [this.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/report-new-pfi-initiative-will-saddle-nhs-trusts-with-worse-debts-than-before-9882892.html) Heck, just in compensation, the [NHS doubled the amount](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/private-healthcare-blunders-cost-nhs-8994043) it's paying out last year because of private healthcare blunders (which the tax-payer has to pay for, *of course*). As I said, there's so much evidence on this, if you're interested a google will get you there. 

2. On adequacy of care, you could compare studies like [this](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2014/jun/1755_davis_mirror_mirror_2014.pdf) - which found that in data from 2013 and before the NHS was possibly the best healthcare system in the world - and [this year's Euro Health Consumer Index](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/en/news/euro-health-consumer-index-2015/), which has the NHS come 14th in Europe alone. (Though the best healthcare in the world is European, without a doubt, so we can think of this as roughly '14th in the world', which is less bad.) Or again you could go the poll/news route: [this site collects quite a lot of data.](http://nhap.org/what-you-can-do/facts-fingertips/impact-of-nhs-privatisation-and-privatisation-failures/) Hinchingbrooke [is a particular lesson.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/09/hinchingbrooke-hospital-special-measures-cqc-report) 

&gt;Point 4 - I agree with this and have a problem with it however this is an issue with the private companies in question and the set up. Laws, regulations etc can be put in place to stop this happening.

Businesses will always find ways around it. Why? Well, you tell me. What's the difference between a publicly run and a privately run service, at its heart? Incentive is the answer. The incentive for a publicly run service is to do its job effectively. If everyone does their job, and the service is good, then everyone is happy. How about the private company? The incentive is profit. Everything services that. That means they're *always*, relentlessly, looking for ways to cut costs and to exploit labour. They're always looking for ways to maximise their profit, while balancing their market viability. This is inevitably worse in things like train services and healthcare, because the government isn't really opening up the market, they're awarding government sanctioned monopolies. That means that these companies don't even really have to think about competitiveness.

&gt;Point 5 - These companies will be providing jobs and be paying taxes, employing people who also pay tax and spend in our economy, I don't see any issue with this apart from an ideological one, however you criticise using ideological standpoints in point 3??

Ok, I'll be clearer. I am ideologically opposed. I wasn't saying that ideologies are bad. I was saying that the government claims it's making things more efficient, effective, and cheaper, but are instead driven by an ulterior motive. They don't care about efficiency, effectiveness, or cost. But an ideological one was not the point I was making. The point I was making is simple:

Option a. I give a public company £5bn. That public company spend £5bn on healthcare. The public gets £5bn worth of healthcare as a result.

Option b. I give a private company £5bn. That private company spends £2.5bn, and takes £2.5bn profit. The public pays for £5bn worth of healthcare and gets £2.5bn worth of it.

This is all tied into the above. It gives worse healthcare delivery, worse outcomes, more expensive for the state and individual... etc. But yes, there's a moral - and not necessarily ideological - aspect to it. If a company is owned by shareholders and run by a CEO, all of whom created the product, set up the infrastructure, and so on, then making a profit on that makes sense. We're not talking about that. We're talking about private companies using NHS drugs, buildings, equipment, staff, and infrastructure, and making a profit on the public out of something *owned by the public*.

Gcbro replied of course, why wouldn't we? And that's when ubpmom let them know I don't allow ubpdmom to travel with me, even if we take the same flight. (This is because I had a lifetime of bad travel experiences [two trips a year annually to visit extended family growing up] but it culminated in a horrible experience I had with her traveling to Europe. She flips out and screams at airline attendants if our flight is late or cancelled which makes me uncomfortable. She repeatedly aggravates me on the flight itself even after polite warnings. She also refuses to let me drive the rental car in any circumstances and only sets ""our itinerary"" to her liking. She refuses to let me drive (at 30) even though she gets disoriented the moment she enters a roundabout. This has resulted in many a near collision and angry drivers honking at her/us. In Europe she got stuck going around two round abouts on a toll road getting tolled 9 times at 11euro a pop. She was screaming and crying the whole time and would not pull over, screaming that she 'can't' despite the large shoulder with other cars parked.  She did all of this in front of company in the same car. She also refused to learn any of the language of the country we were in (even hello or thank you, just barked commands in English) which the citizens of this country find particularly disrespectful. After we left eventually the car rental company tried to say first she damaged the car, then tried to say it was totaled resulting in a 3 year foreign court battle (there was no damage to the car, it was a scam). I could go on and on. I reaped an emotional toll from that trip for years.)

So now I make my way to the airport, get on the plane and sit separate, then we make our own arrangements to wherever we're going [separate car rental, hotel, etc]). It's better for my sanity this way even if were both going to the same family's wedding, but of course ubpdmom doesn't understand.

Antenna was up when ubpdmom made this statement to SIL, and you're right, it is mocking and disrespectful. SIL had asked ubpdmom why I made those 'rules' and ubpdmom replied with that line. I wasn't present.

Many migrants came with this attitude, that Europe was so overflowing to the brim with jobs that everyone could get any job they wanted (and in some cases, an immediate complimentary house and a car to go with it) no short time after crossing the finish line at the border. There's a number of reasons for this, from genuine misinformation or ignorance about another part of the world they had never actually been to and only ever hear about from gossip to the sort of depressing or desperate situation that leads somebody to believe something like crossing the border will instantly and completely solve all their problems for good.

 So a lot of migrants came with the false pretense that making it over the border was the *end* of their troubles, the smooth sailing after the hard part of just getting there when nobody of authority ever promised them otherwise. Many still though didn't know what they were signing up for in the trip until they were already on the way for another reason the article covers: In order to afford the trip, many migrants sell all their shit. At that point you largely can't back out - you're on board whether or not you have any second thoughts. Many didn't find out they were going to be getting on a ""ship"" barely more seaworthy than a plank of wood until they saw it themselves, and this was *long* after the point where they had sold all their shit to get that far. What, are they going to bow out then, illegally trek all the way back home and buy all their shit back?

Fleabitten subscribes to a hindsight bias that the migrants knew what we do *now* about the dangers of illegal immigration *before* they themselves had done so back when the crisis flared up, and that simply isn't the reality of the situation. Neither is this notion that they had any sort of realistic idea of what Europe was actually like or the long and complicated administrative and logistical nightmare that awaited them if they actually got there.

&gt; that require new non commercial buildings be built in the neoclassical style. A tested architectural style,

 unfortunately there is a reason why many don't build neo-classical buildings  anymore. Like anywhere... It costs too much money, with all the labor laws and regulations, the salaries, not to mention the unions etc it's just not cost effective, back in the day it was easy because you could pay someone to chip away at stone all day for pennis on the dollar. Most money these days as an architecture friend told me is spent paying the people who build the building not the building itself. Nonetheless there are still people who build classical stuff

I wanted to invest in real estate in Greece to maybe beautify some old buildings in the classical style, particularly the classic french style, even though it would cost more and sell them. Just because I think making Athens look nicer is worth it. But I'm not doing it now,  Too much bureaucracy, laws etc. Maybe in the future when you have liberal government, But that's the story for pretty much anyone looking to invest in Greece which is why few people do.

In fact, I have a Hispanic (ethnically triracial) friend who has stated to me that although he does recognize that the Spencerian Alt-Right is inherently Euro-centric, he wishes the core ideas would gain acceptance among his people rather than the ""gibsmedats"" attitude. 

Also relevant are the times an Ethiopian and a Somalian who went on /pol/ and expressed their wishes of creating order in their respective nations. The Somalian, If I remember correctly, even stated that he wanted to become ""The Hitler of Somalia."" 

As to why the Alt-Right and other neo-traditionalist movements are gaining power among the rising generation, I think it is as simple as looking to the environment in which they were raised.

t3_5ajtz1,1478015565,1481116552,d9gxtyu,False,0,,t3_5ajtz1,"&gt; Ours is not a case of numerous liberal institutions failing to make as big an impact as their prominence might suggest, as it is in the United States; what passes for liberal “institutions” in the Philippines are neither numerous nor prominent. But **our country, as historian Leloy Claudio notes, has a rich, albeit largely forgotten, liberal tradition, from Jose Rizal and the late-19th-century Ilustrados, influenced by the French Enlightenment in Belle Époque Europe; to the American-educated politicians of the first half of the 20th century such as Carlos P. Romulo, Camilo Osias and Salvador P. Lopez.** It is quite telling that Philippine liberalism was alive and well in our formative years, back when it was fighting for the nation’s identity. Early Pinoy intellectuals, while highly critical of colonial rule, were wise to appropriate our colonizers’ highest ideals. **We were once swimming in the twin influences of European intellectualism and American egalitarianism but now, a dictatorship and a handful of dysfunctional administrations later, our most influential political thinker is Mocha “Do We Really Need Freedom?” Uson.**

&gt; Our liberal past seems like a lucid interval now that **we have pretty much reverted to pre-Rizal times, with a hard-line religiosity that tends to be inflexible when it comes to LGBT and women’s rights, but not so much when it comes to basic human rights; and our apparent desire for authoritarian rule.** It’s lonely being a Filipino liberal in 2016. **You can shout all you want in your tiny echo chambers on social media but all it offers is the empty satisfaction of venting within a support group. Worse, rabid fans of the administration will break into your circle jerk and engage in keyboard terrorism.** Even if it’s a student publication as small as Ateneo’s Mochang Tanga Blog, a satire on Mocha Uson’s deceitful Facebook page “blog,” you can bet that the subject of ridicule will find its editor in chief’s profile and dangle it on social media for trolls to feast on. They have strength in numbers — approximately 86-90 percent of the populace — and they know it.

&gt; Seeing the liberal half of America barely make a dent in Trump’s ascent after months of “evisceration” is hardly inspiring for the tired, frustrated 10 percent of this country. But maybe our liberalism — outnumbered and defeated — can be nobler. It can stand as a test case for the rest of the world, a complete inverse of Francis Fukuyama’s “End of History,” which proudly and prematurely declared the triumph of liberal ideas, as if political history had an endgame. **Maybe liberalism is meant to be a constant struggle, a process of self-correction, of being humbled and forced to reassess its importance, so it can feel righteous once again.**

&gt; What is liberalism, anyway? The western world has had to revisit this question in the face of a growing authoritarian revival, going as far as to question liberalism’s self-assuredness. Liberals have become too smug, the thinking goes, and it needs “to be defined and defended all over again,” as Tim Stanley and Alexander Lee wrote in The Atlantic two years ago. **They argue that liberalism, in believing itself to be historically-correct, has forgotten what it’s all about: human dignity. This is the basis of liberty, that every person’s humanity should at all times be intact, and therefore every person should “strive to defend and preserve not only their own liberty, but also that of all others in their society using law.”**

&gt; I identify as a liberal, even if I distance myself from the mostly liberal thought police, those annoying cadre of shamers who impulsively assume bigotry in almost every comment (no matter how lame or inconsequential) without careful examination. But **I believe in things like equal rights for everyone regardless of race, gender, class, and religious belief. I believe no one — including alleged or convicted criminals — should ever be killed. I believe no one — especially not indigenous people whose rights have already been violated — should be run over or shot by police. And I believe these things to be a matter of common sense.** So I tend to be forgiving of those self-righteous liberal crusaders, especially in the Philippines, because this is a country that does not see these things as common sense. **Pinoy liberals aren’t smug because they think they’ve won; they’re angry because this country never lets them win. We never thought history had ended so we never had the luxury of taking liberalism for granted.** We don’t need to “redefine” something that isn’t even considered basic.

&gt; Like any angry and frustrated Pinoy liberal, I often look to the west for comfort. My favorite moment in liberal America’s vain attempt at “destroying” Trump was from an episode in Late Night With Seth Meyers last month. After playing a clip of Trump denying his birther claims and saying, “President Obama was born in the United States, period,” he responded, to the uproarious delight of the studio audience, “F\*\*k you, exclamation point. You don’t get to peddle racist rhetoric for five years and decide when it’s over; we decide when it’s over.” It was so satisfying to watch, not only because it was on point, but because goody-two-shoes Seth Meyers cursed — and on network TV, no less. **Much has been said about President Duterte’s profanity and how it’s unbecoming of a head of state, but what really makes it problematic is that he is the oppressor. Cursing is more valuable as the weapon of the oppressed, the subjugated, the underdog. It’s only vulgar when used from a position of power. When used by the powerless, it can be liberating and poetic.**

&gt; Let’s keep our heads up, my fellow Pinoy liberals. Our anger is more righteous, and far more earned than America’s. **We are defeated; and precisely because of this, we have every right to be loud, to show that liberalism isn’t over. F\*\*k the majority. We decide when it’s over.**",False,0,Philippines,,5,gradenko_2000,,t5_2qjov

I'm talking about refugees admitted to the US post 9/11. The 3 did not harm anyone, they wanted to leave the US. If you're talking about actual harm caused by terrorist refugees, it's 0% in the US.

&gt;What about Europe?

Germany witnessed an unprecedented 440% increase in refugees- Australia isn't going to have anything like those numbers, but despite that, [German citizens are more likely to commit crimes than refugees](https://www.thelocal.de/20151113/police-refugees-commit-less-crimes-than-germans). According to the German police, the ""vast majority of asylum-seekers [commit] no offenses."", and the majority of offences committed are not violent, being minor theft(33%) or fraud(32%). Remember that they still commit less crime than the average german. 

Of course you might say ""Even one crime by a refugee is too much!"" but then you might as well shut down your borders. Even legal immigrants commit crime, even citizens of the EU who come to Germany commit crime. 


But if you to choose between 10,000 new German citizens and 10,000 new refugees, the statistics show that the refugees are less likely to be criminal, despite their more adverse conditions.

&gt; The Cult are an English rock band that gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-80s singles such as ""She Sells Sanctuary"" before breaking into the American metal market in the late-80s with songs such as ""Love Removal Machine"". Known for having ""firmly set its sights on neo-metal godhood"", the band fuses a heavy revivalist sound with ""the pseudo-mysticism"" of ""The Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock"" in the words of critics. Since their earliest form in Bradford during 1981, the band has had various line-ups, but the longest serving band members are vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy, both of whom are the band's songwriters.

&gt; Perhaps best known today for the hit arena rock singles ""Fire Woman"" and ""Sun King"" as well as the smooth, dark post-punk song ""She Sells Sanctuary"", the group's origins go back to an outfit by the name of Southern Death Cult, a 1981 project of vocalist Ian Astbury (born May 14, 1962). Exploring the boundaries of alternative post-punk music, Astbury drew major influence from the culture and beliefs of Native Americans based on his time living in Canada in his youth, and this sense of earthy spirituality and mysticism influenced much of his music. The fledgling group, featuring Astbury alongside David Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass), and Haq Quereshi (drums), became an underground sensation and even released a dual-sided single in  December 1982.

&gt; Still, Astbury found fault with the band's musical direction, and he floated around various other outfits for a while, including a project titled Death Cult. Inspired by American hard rock and aggressive psychedelia, he devised a group titled simply the Cult that would distance itself from the more gloomy and goth rock cultural scenes of his previous groups. Soon after the Cult's birth in early 1984, it stuck a chord with British audiences, particularly the combo of Astbury and guitarist / songwriter Billy Duffy.

&gt; The band released their debut album, 'Dreamtime', in the fall of 1984. With the single ""Spiritwalker"", a piece of powerful arena rock, picking up some steam, 'Dreamtime reached number 21 on the U.K. charts. After moving to London for their recording work, the band released their sophomore album 'Love', which charted at #4 in the United Kingdom, and they unleashed singles such as ""She Sells Sanctuary"" and Rain. The former song gave the band a wonderful taste of North American commercial success, reaching the top 40 of the U.S. Club Play Singles chart.

&gt; In the late-80s, the band adopted an even more hard rock and energetic punk-infused sound with their third release 'Electric', which spawned the singles ""Love Removal Machine"" and ""Little Devil"" (also known as ""Lil' Devil""). Reaching the top 40 of the Billboard album chart in the U.S., 'Electric' would also later be cited in the popular book '1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die'. The Cult's 1989 album, 'Sonic Temple', enabled them to break into the North American market completely, with singles ""Fire Woman"" and ""Sun King"" becoming U.S. top 40 smashes and rock radio staples to this day.

&gt; Still, by the early 90s, the band was fraying behind the scenes, due to alcohol abuse and off-stage tensions. Band members Duffy and Astbury found themselves down to a duo, and the 1991 release 'Ceremony' shown that their times of rock godhood had, at least temporarily, passed. With Astbury struggling to take a hold of his personal life, all of the tension lead to a complete split-up in 1995.

&gt; Between 1999 and 2002, the band reformed as a studio project to record the album 'Beyond Good and Evil', and they reissued all of their albums in Asia and eastern Europe in 2003, doing another round of reissues in Japan in 2004. In 2006, the band reformed again completely to perform a series of worldwide tours. In October 2007, the band released the album 'Born into This' on the Roadrunner Records label.

&gt; In August 2009, The Cult embarked on the world Love Live tour, playing two sets: the first set being the 'Love' album in its entirety and the second set consisting of songs from their extensive hits catalog. On September 14, 2010, the band released a special 'Capsule' which included CD, DVD, Vinyl, and USB formats. This work featured the new tracks ""Every Man and Woman is a Star"" and ""Siberia"". On November 16, 2011, The Cult released 'Capsule 2' featuring ""Embers"" and ""Until the Light Takes Us"".

&gt; In 2011, the Cult– then made up of Astbury, Duffy, drummer John Tempesta, and bassist Chris Wyse– recorded 'Choice Of Weapon', the band’s ninth studio album and first in five years. Scheduled for a May 22, 2012 release in the U.S. and a May 21, 2012 release in the U.K., 'Choice Of Weapon' was recorded in ten months, beginning in March 2011 at studios in New York City, Los Angeles and then leading to the band's Witch Mountain studio as well as the California high desert.

&gt; After the album's announcement, the band released single ""Lucifer"" for stream and sale. The album ended up named iTunes ""Rock Album of the Year"" for 2012. The Cult has also been working on film and graphic elements to accompany their recent work, and they underwent a successful 2012 World Tour.  Read more on Last.fm.

At first my wife read it, while I read Running with the Buffaloes but I took over a few weeks ago to be done in time for the AR discussion.*

The US running community has been Pre-obsessed for 40 years, when The Man of USA distance running has been alive and well right here in Boulder Colorado. I get that Pre was more charismatic and Rodgers more approachable, but Shorter with two (both effectively Gold) Olympic medals, plus four at Fukuoka, really is in my book the greatest US distance runner on the world stage.  
 
Great book, the relationship with his father is wrenching to read, but now we have a better understanding of Shorter’s steely resolve and sometimes aloof demeanor.
 
I grew up watching Shorter, from his Olympic win in Munich which wasn’t hype up beforehand like Ryun’s or Pre’s races in that Olympics, even though he was a favorite. I clearly remember watching the skinny guy with the big mustache in that bizarre finish with Erich Segal yellng out, “It’s Okay Frank you’ve got this! 
 
And I liked how he masterfully wove that finish with the upset by Cierpinksi four years later in Montreal. At the time there were some grumblings, but actually you heard more about Viren’s purported blood doping which at the time was undectable and not even illegal. But as the 1980s wore on, and the Eastern Europeans kept racking up medals, you heard more and more questioning.
 
Even though Shorter was not as popular as some of the other runners of the era, he was iconic and it’s good that he is recognized as father of the American running boom. And for me, his story (and those of other great runners over a 15 or so year golden era) was brought to life by Kenny Moore’s articles in Sports Illustrated. 
 
I knew that Shorter was an associate/training partner of John L. Parker Jr., but didn’t know that they roomed together and were so close in those early years in Florida.
 
Caught a few minor errors in the book. He got the year of the Kent State protests and expansion of the Viet Nam war off by a year. There were protests in 1969, the year he graduated from Yale, but Kent State and the invasion of Cambodia were in 1970. He also mentioned that Craig Virgin was from Indiana. Virgin was Illini through and through, and has lived there his entire life. 
 
Seemed to have ambivalence toward Viren, which is understandable. But Viren only went to BYU for one semester, so it’s hard to say that he was a “mediocre runner” in college. From what I recall is that he went there, competed only a few times and left. Had Shorter left after his freshman or sophomore year at Yale, only to re-emerge a couple years later at Fukuoka and Munich, you could almost say the same thing. Points taken however, on Viren’s remarkable rise and fall in the Olympic cycle. 
 
I spent an evening at Kenny Moore’s “cottage” (It was a nice house! A friend was house sitting at the time) in Eugene some 10-12 years after Pre’s accident. You can’t help but go what if, and even Shorter who said he never did that ventured a what if in the book. The last person to see his friend, and I believe him when he says Pre wasn’t that drunk. 
 
Chilling discussion of his father and family, threaded throughout the book.

Why? Well, here's my line of reasoning, drawn from this video and another article which I will link below:

Simply stated, Russia is the bad guy, and Vladimir Putin is an asshole. This is can be substantiated by what Russia is doing, from its eerily dictatorship-like behavior within its own country, and more importantly, its aggressive foreign policy and its desire to expand its borders. I think everyone can agree on that one point -- Russia very clearly wants to expand its borders as much as possible, and will stop at nothing at this mission.

Now, the EU and the NATO are the only two things that have kept Russia in check and prevented Russia from aggressively pursuing its border expansion. A little look at history will tell you that the EU has played a key part in curbing Russian border expansion. Thus, the fracturing of both the EU and the NATO are some of the primary Russian foreign policy objectives.

Donald Trump does not respect Article 5 of the NATO, and has publicly stated that he will think twice before coming to the support of the Baltic states in the event of an invasion. Without the NATO, Russia can expand borders without consequences. Further, there could be a division of the EU with other European countries pursuing Brexit-like referendums. This will only cascade into something far, far worse.

WWIII does not start with Russia directly launching nuclear missiles directly onto the East Coast. Russia does not have the balls for that. Instead, it starts with the bullying of Russian neighbors. The unity of the EU and the NATO are highly necessary to stop this bullying, and hence preventing Russia from causing World War III.

I will quote a passage from one of my favorite articles on the subject. https://medium.com/@theonlytoby/history-tells-us-what-will-happen-next-with-brexit-trump-a3fefd154714#.ifh13us7i

&gt;An example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this:

&gt;Brexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum. Le Pen wins an election in France. Europe now has a fractured EU. The EU, for all its many awful faults, has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before. The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putin’s military ambitions. European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy, and helped temper Russia’s attacks on Ukraine (there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union). Trump wins in the US. Trump becomes isolationist, which weakens NATO. He has already said he would not automatically honour NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics.

&gt;With a fractured EU, and weakened NATO, Putin, facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia, needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people. He funds far right anti-EU activists in Latvia, who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country (the EU border with Russia). Russia sends ‘peace keeping forces’ and ‘aid lorries’ into Latvia, as it did in Georgia, and in Ukraine. He annexes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine (Crimea has the same population as Latvia, by the way).

&gt;A divided Europe, with the leaders of France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and others now pro-Russia, anti-EU, and funded by Putin, overrule calls for sanctions or a military response. NATO is slow to respond: Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action. Russia, seeing no real resistance to their actions, move further into Latvia, and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate, as they have now been invaded so have no choice. Half of Europe sides with them, a few countries remain neutral, and a few side with Russia. Where does Turkey stand on this? How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe? Who uses a nuclear weapon first?

&gt;This is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario. The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts. And of course many of them lead to nothing happening. But based on history we are due another period of destruction, and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one.

There is one argument that can be made against this line of reasoning: that Russia isn't really an asshole country. It is actually a good country that is intent on invading its neighbors for morally correct reasons.

To the person making this argument, I would ask him to try to answer the question: why does Russia want to invade its neighboring states, and is it morally right in doing so? If, in fact, it is morally right, then it would indicate that Russia doesn't want to go much further than the invasion of its immediate neighbors because it is morally right in invading those neighbors, and not any other countries.

BUT, if it is morally wrong, then it is only reasonable to conclude that Russia wants to expand its borders for the sake of expanding it's borders, and hence, it is reasonable to conclude that its border expansion goals are unlimited, thus making it an asshole country.
Is Russia an asshole country? If so, the EU and NATO need to remain together. If not, it is okay for the EU and NATO to be fractured.

It's a treat, something I maybe eat once a week or so. The power in having a burger or something like that is just psychological, it's like telling yourself ""see, you don't have to be a recluse, you can enjoy your food and still not get fat"". 

I **try** to be as precise with my calories as I can. Most fast food places, at least here in the EU, have the macros/calories on the menu. And if I REALLY want or can't avoid having something that doesn't declare its calories/macros, I ballpark it based on the ingredients and try to err on the high end of the caloric estimate and slightly lower on the macro estimate, just so I make sure that I'm more careful with the rest of the day. For example, the burger I had like half an hour ago I estimated to be around 900 calories based on the ingredients and the calories of the closest similar burger that has a macro/calorie declaration, like something from McDonalds. And for dinner I'll have half a kilo of the baked chicken breast that I mentioned with some salad and end the day at some 1700kcal, 160ish grams of protein, 50ish grams of fat and the rest in carbs, which I don't care about that much. But, I'll also have some psyllium seed husks in water for fiber, a multivitamin and a few omega3 caps every day - to ensure good digestion and plug any little micronutrient holes that I might have over the day.

As for fat sources, it's pretty varied. Sometimes it's fatty fish (salmon), sometimes fatty meat (pork, beef, poultry with the skin), sometimes fatty cheese. I don't obsess about these things. I just try to keep fat between 40 and 60 grams over the day.

That said, the UK/European barkeeping scene might be really different than the US one.

Most bars and restaurants will either have an online application process, or a simple paper one you pick up on site (again with the exception of the really high end jobs).

The same from 2005.

They're both in Swedish, but scroll down to the bottom of both and there's an English summary. A quote from the '96 study:

&gt;We can conclude that, the problem of immigrant criminality is not perhaps as large as is often supposed. However, regarding serious crimes such as rape, homicide, manslaughter and robbery the proportion is often far higher than for criminality as a whole.

A quote from the 2005 study:

&gt;The proportion of persons suspected of offences is greater in groups from certain geographical areas than it is in those from others. This is the case for certain parts of Africa, such as North Africa, for example, and for Western Asia. Those coming from West European countries, South-East Asia and from the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zeeland comprise the groups of those born outside Sweden who are registered as crime suspects least often.

The actual statistics are further up in the docs + in Swedish if you can be bothered google translating them.

Also a 2016 police report:

https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Lagesbild%20over%20sexuella%20ofredanden.pdf

&gt; The Blind Boys of Alabama are a gospel music group from Alabama that first formed at the Talledega School for the Deaf and Blind in 1939. 

&gt; Although the Blind Boys of Alabama have been singing gospel music for more than five decades, it's only recently that the group has had the benefit of a major record company behind them. The founding members were Clarence Fountain, Johnny Fields, George Scott, Ollice Thomas, and Vel Trayler. The current group consists of Eric McKinney,  Billy Bowers, Jimmy Carter, Joey Williams, and Donald Dillion. 

&gt; From their inception in the 1930s, when all were boys, all members of the group except one were blind. They began singing when all were students, in the glee club, at the Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Alabama, but didn't begin recording until 1948. As a youth, Fountain heard the legendary Golden Gate Quintet on the radio; the early Five Blind Boys of Alabama took their musical cues from that group. The group began singing professionally as the Happyland Jubilee Singers, and for years only toured the Bible Belt in the Southern U.S. 

&gt; Since 1948, they've recorded for a variety of small record companies, and had gospel music hits in the 1950s with ""Oh, Lord Stand By Me"" and ""I Can See Everybody's Mother But I Can't See Mine"". In 1950, after the death of one of their members, the group renamed themselves simply the Blind Boys of Alabama. 

&gt; The group recorded first for the Newark-based Coleman Records label. Between 1953 and 1957, the group recorded for Art Rupe's California-based Specialty label. In the 1960s, the group's hard-driving gospel sounds were imitated by people like Bobby ""Blue"" Bland and Marvin Gaye. The group recorded extensively for the Vee Jay label from 1963 to 1965. In 1969, Fountain left the group for a decade to try to make it on his own, and the group re-formed with all the original members in the late 1970s. 

&gt; They gained widespread success in 1988, when they starred in an Obie Award-winning Broadway show. According to Fountain, the group's high point was being on Broadway for 15 weeks with the musical Gospel at Colonus. The musical opened up new avenues to bookings for the group, and they began touring theaters and larger churches in the early 1990s, embarking on their first European tours as well. The group was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship in 1994. In 1994 and 1995, the group played festivals including the Philadelphia Folk Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival and the King Biscuit Blues Festival. The group also toured in Melbourne, Australia  and the World's Fair, in Brisbane.
 Mid-1990s television appearances included Black Entertainment Television's On Jazz, and even a cameo on Beverly Hills, 90210. 

&gt; Since the turn of the century, founding members, George Scott (2005) and Johnny Fields (2009) passed away. Clarence Fountain remains the only living founding member.   The group is still performing, under the vocal leadership of longtime member, Jimmy Carter. Releases by the group in recent years have been favorites at the Grammy Awards — they have won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album every year since 2002. The Blind Boys of Alabama were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2002. Their cover of the Tom Waits song ""Way Down in The Hole"" was featured as the opening theme for season one of HBO's The Wire. In 2008 they released Down in New Orleans, on which they were accompanied by such Crescent City legends as the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Allen Toussaint. Read more on Last.fm.

Assim como um movimento feminista extremo alimenta o crescimento de um grupo machista extremo, o extremismo contra os evangélicos pode leva-los a ganhar apoio daqueles que antes eram apáticos à política, os moderados, inclusive da igreja católica e outros grupos cristãos.

Acho que o maior exemplo disso é essa eleição no Rio, onde acredito que houve sim certo alinhamento entre várias vertentes evangélicas que a princípio não se apoiariam, mas o fizeram devido a hostilização que a militância do PSOL tem demonstrado contra estes grupos (pelo menos isso é o que eu percebo, pois não moro no rio e apenas estou acompanhando pelas notícias e comentários).

Det er, i mangel af bedre ord, en oligarkisk-teknokratisk styreform, hvor demokratiet er i anden række - derfor bliver aftaler som CETA ikke forhandlet i offentligheden, og de rigtige organisationer får ikke mulighed for at informere og skabe den folkelige debat, som vi kender det herhjemme når nye politiske aftaler skal i hus. 

Det skaber dels dårligere aftaler, da EU kun trækker på nogle få lobbyisters og ""eksperters"" viden, istedet for hele den demokratiske masses ønsker og viden. Og, det skaber en struktur hvor kommissionen i bund og grund føler at den kan sætte en kurs, og så må folket bare følge efter, eller ikke få de fordele, som også er ved fx CETA. 

CETA er problematisk, ikke fordi det er dårligt med handelsaftaler, men fordi den indeholder nogle elementer - som fx ringere miljø/kemi/forbruger-beskyttelse, og en overnational domstol der kan træffe afgørelser på baggrund af en tvivlsom domsstolssammensætning.

&gt; Novembers Doom is one of the earliest U.S. death/doom metal bands that are still active today. The band is from Chicago, Illinois. They are currently signed to The End Records.

&gt; Novembers Doom formed in 1989, but it was not until 1992 that Novembers Doom would receive some attention in the metal world. An early deal with Regress Records, of Italy, allowed Avantgarde Records to hear the band. This demo (Her Tears Drop) was heavy, combined with moods of darkness and despair. The two songs would lead to the release of the band's full length debut CD, Amid Its Hallowed Mirth on Avant Garde and Nuclear Blast. Exploring and expanding, the band added female backing vocals and continued its thick, eerie brand of metal. A compilation track for Pavement Music soon followed. In 1997, Novembers Doom released the EP For Every Leaf That Falls. The album was well received, leading to favourable reviews and response worldwide. Novembers Doom has since released their second full length album Of Sculptured Ivy and Stone Flowers, with Martyr Music Group. This new offering had received rave reviews.

&gt; In May of 2000, Novembers Doom entered the recording studio once again, to record the follow up to Of Sculptured Ivy and Stone Flowers. The band has recorded The Knowing with Studio One's Chris Djuricic. The CD is an extension of the previous material, only taking steps in new directions to enhance their already original sound.

&gt; In July of 2000, Novembers Doom officially became a member of Dark Symphonies. Realizing the bands potential, they constructed a deal with Martyr Music Group, to include the band on its roster, releasing The Knowing to the public.

&gt; Now, with their third full length release receiving praise, and a European licensed release of the CD through Pavement Music, Novembers Doom secured themselves more attention than before.

&gt; To Welcome the Fade

&gt; In October 2002, Novembers Doom entered the studio to begin work on their second full length of new material for Dark Symphonies. The band's fourth full length album would be entitled To Welcome the Fade, only this time they recruited the talents of the Grammy Award-winning producer, Neil Kernon. Kernon, best known for his work with acts like Hall &amp; Oates, Kansas, Yes, Queensrÿche, Judas Priest, and more recently Nevermore and Cannibal Corpse, brought a new power and clarity to the sound of the band. This album was chosen as the Number One metal album of 2002 in Metal Maniacs magazine by one of its head editors, Novembers Doom was also a featured cover story on their January 2003 issue.

&gt; In 2004, a successful tour in North America with The Gathering eventually leading to a signing with The End Records that summer. The band entered the studio in the fall to record their fifth album, The Pale Haunt Departure. This time around the band enlisted the help of the very respected producer and artist Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Bloodbath and Nightingale) for the mixing duties, and the mastering went to metal guitarist and producer James Murphy (Testament, Obituary and Disincarnate).

&gt; In March 2005, The Pale Haunt Departure was released with a tour supporting it. Novembers Doom continues to forge ahead, meshing diverse musical styles and textures in the pursuit of always creating a new and unique listening experience with each new release, while retaining their heavy sound and dark lyrics.

&gt; The Novella Reservoir

&gt; In June 2006, the band's sixth full-length album, The Novella Reservoir, was announced on The End Records' website. The album will contain eight tracks. It is a follow-up to The Pale Haunt Departure.

Most of the big sports are hosted in north america except soccer, so for the most part they are scheduled to make it easy for people in NA to watch. Which gives sports bars live events on their TVs consistently during times when people would drink and be merry.    

Bigger gaming tournaments might be held all over the world and they are scheduled for prime time viewing in the country they are hosted in. Which makes it challenging to watch live if the event is hosted in Europe, but near impossible to watch live if hosted in southern Asia.  
  
So for those events you would be watching replays and would need a dedicated group of patrons that would make the effort to watch as a group on a delay, so it would take time if it happened at all. Its cool to have a success full bar and have a group of guys watch a replay of darts on one of your TVs, but its hard to build a business solely on that type of patron.  
  
the other big thing is a lot of people naturally say oh man **if I could play games and drink beer that would be great!**   
 
The problem is liquor licensing in BC and a few people have touched on it already.  
Most restaurants get a food primary license cause its faster and costs about $475 (75% cheaper than a liquor primary licence), problem is you can't get one if the idea of your games bar is not food first, the idea behind a food primary licence is a restaurant that also happens to sell booze.  
  
Now if you want a games/E-Sport bar in the ""traditional"" sense you are looking at a very fine line, you would need a Liquor Primary license which takes 7-12 months to get, costs $2,200, and you would need to avoid at all costs coming off as an arcade. The BC liquor branch specifically says on the site that arcades can not get Liquor licences (cause arcades are a business that is directed at minors, ya ya that's dumb I know but its how it is).  
  
those were the big start up issues that I could think of that seemed like massive hurdles, outside of the regular ones you have with starting a restaurant. As much as people might like the idea of an E-Sports bar the timing of major gaming events if held outside of NA, and BC's liquor laws make it harder to succeed, since you can't just make an adult arcade with booze that also shows E-Sports, You need to be an E-Sports restaurant and Bar that has a couple games too, but that's **if** you wanted to serve booze.  
  
now if you don't serve booze and make it like Interactivity (The Board Game Cafe), no booze, snack foods, retail space with the addition of a viewing lounge/ E-Sports on TVs on the walls that might work much better/ have less of a hindrance to start up. you would loose the Sports Bar feel, but you would open up to a broader age of patrons since you could have minors come in with all their disposable income, and not just a niche of adults that want to drink beer and watch Twitch Streams.",False,0,VictoriaBC,,2,minikyle,,t5_2rbsy

So first off do not assume you are the expert in this conversation. 

I saw further down that you would ask a SW fan if they were a fan of the movies or the EU. Generally you won't meet a SW fan who is only into the EU. A better question would be to ask if they read the EU, but that's assuming they're a pretty big fan. 

If we're sticking to Star Wars I would first ask what they thought of Episode VII. This is a good way to gauge their knowledge. The parallels to Episode IV, Rey's background, what turned Kylo Ren, who is Snoke, etc. 

Based on this discussion you have a better mark on her level of fandom. Once the Episode VII discussion gets stale you could go in a few different directions - did she like the prequels? Does she read the EU? Which is her favorite original trilogy movie? Why? Has she read any of the new SW books? Who's her favorite character? Etc etc etc. 

Branch off into how long she's been a fan and what got her into it?

For gaming ask her what her favorite games are, does she have a favorite type of character to play, assuming she's a PC gamer what is her rig like, when did she start gaming, favorite game, etc. 

All the while listen to her answers and then give your answer. If you disagree with something ""No way...A New Hope is way better than Empire Strikes Back!"" then tell her why you think so but respectfully listen to why she thinks ESB is better. That should give you a lot of conversation material. 

That's really it. Ask questions and get an idea of how your interests in the topic compare. If you know way more than her about something you don't have to prove it. Just stay on her level while pointing out an interesting tidbit every so often that she might not know. If this seems to annoy her apologize and explain how you're a huge fan of whatever it is and that you just love to talk about it but tell her you're ok with changing the subject if she's bored. 

In terms of gaming if you want to give her advice say ""May I suggest something?"" and say you saw some pro gamer do whatever and you started trying it and it worked really well. That way it makes it seem like you learned something amazing and now you're a better player as opposed to ""I'm just better than you are.""

That's really it :)

Those dedicated evangelists are almost all well aware of the idea that earning ""Jesus points"" won't impress God or earn one's way into heaven. The Apostle Paul, the effective founder of Christianity who wrote the bulk of the New Testament, said so [over,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9) and [over,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:20-28) and [over again!](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A16)

Like I said before though, I can't speak for all Christians. There are certainly some who seek to earn favor. There is no evidence, however, that they make up anything but a tiny minority of those who proselytize. 

If someone does try to convert you to Christianity, and you believe they're doing so for their own sake and not yours, you might remind them that Paul also said that all the works, sacrifices, and talents a Christian might have [are nothing and gain nothing](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13&amp;version=NIV) unless they're done out of love.

It is absolutely my opinion that it's a beautiful world. There are aesthetically beautiful things to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel everywhere.

I can believe the world is beautiful, despite the pain and suffering, because I believe that humans have the ability to reduce that suffering, and I further believe that we are doing so.

I disagree that the ""world, in fact, [would] be much improved by the absence of religion."" I don't believe that is fact at all.

I have been curious about food for the last 5 years or so; where it comes from, what makes it bad or good for you, how to cook it, etc. I've found that Michael Pollan is a great author to read to learn about food, and he had a nice rule that he wrote: ""Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much."" He wrote a quick little 60 page book called food rules where he defines the terms in this sentence pretty specifically, but I think it makes sense to me.

In terms of common nutrients like salt, sugar, fat, carbs I think everyone has heard that they're both good and bad in a dozen different ways. It can be frustrating not knowing what's healthy! Trends or lifestyles like vegetarianism, veganism, paleo, raw foodies, even a fad like juicing (god forbid) may point you in the right direction but ultimately there will still be a number of exceptions.
A lot of people volley for raw food only (or mostly) but from the way I understand evolution part of the reason humanity developed superior usage of brainpower was the discovery of cooking, allowing your body to consume more calories at once from the food you eat so you don't spend half you day finding your food and chewing it. Cooking and processing can unlock nutrients that wouldn't be accessible to our bodies if we just ate them raw. While a lot of food is great to eat raw, like salads and fruits, I'm not going to eat a raw sweet potato, I won't get anything out of that. Even raw kale is so fibrous you chew each leaf forever before you can swallow it, but if you massage it with some acidic dressing, it softens and becomes significantly more edible.

So let's say that's our philosophy now, let's find every nutrient in every food and figure out what needs to be cooked and what can be eaten raw, and we'll build a diet out of that, right? Wrong. There's no database for that... except history. This is another thing I think Pollan conveys very well in his book (and Netflix series) cooked. People have thrived for thousands of years without obesity, but also without juicing, or vitamin supplements, or dieting smoothies. Learning from cultural traditions of eating is the best way I've been able to understand what is healthy. There are just too many variables! Even if we know the exact contents of everything we put in our bodies, we won't know how much of it we actually digest and benefit from unless we can describe every enzyme and interactive nutritional agent in our body, which won't happen for a while. My favorite example is corn, or maize more specifically. Early civilizations of North and Central America lived off of corn, it made up a huge percentage of their diet. When corn was taken back to Europe, everyone ate a bunch of it and got sick with pallegra due to a vitamin deficiency or something (one of the big diseases contributing to the spread of vampire lore, but that's for another time), which was not fun. Turns out, maize had some pretty specific processing protocol (the Good Eats episode on tortillas explains this very well) to extract nutrients from it, along with how it interacted with the food in the rest of their diet.

Next there's fermentation. This is food processing, where bacteria basically digests part of your food for you, adding some tasty and sometimes nutritious treats of their own. Chocolate, bread (made properly), beer, wine, yogurt, and sometimes pickling are all forms of fermentation. I don't know a lot about why fermentation is good for you, but there's a reason it's been around about as long as we have. It's a good place to start for healthy food preparation ideas.

TLDR: Learn about food culture and traditions. Cooking methods, ingredient combinations, and even fermentation techniques developed over generations of thriving and healthy lifestyles. Use them. Also nutrients on a label can only tell you so much, assuming we know everything about how the human body processes food is ignorant. Michael Pollan, Good Eats.

Maarra:

""The Saracens, indeed, concealed themselves in underground caves, and none, or few, appeared. When our men had carried off all that they found above ground, thinking that everything else was with the Saracens, they searched out the caves with fire and sulphur smoke; and because they did not find much booty there, in hopes of spoils they tortured to death the Saracens whom they could find. It happened, however, to some of our men that when they led the Saracens through the city for spoils, the Saracens conducted them to cisterns, and suddenly hurled themselves into them, choosing death rather than to be willing to reveal their own or other's property. Wherefore, all fell down dead; and they were cast forth among the swamps of the city and outside the walls. And so not much booty was taken in the city.""

Jerusalem:

""But now that our men had possession of the walls and towers, wonderful sights were to be seen. Some of our men (and this was more merciful) cut off the heads of their enemies; others shot them with arrows, so that they fell from the towers; others tortured them longer by casting them into the flames. Piles of heads, hands, and feet were to be seen in the streets of the city. It was necessary to pick one's way over the 
bodies of men and horses. But these were small matters compared 
to what happened at the Temple of Solomon, a place where religious services are ordinarily chanted. What happened there? If I tell the truth, it will exceed your powers of belief. So let it suffice to say this much, at least, that in the Temple and porch of Solomon, men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins. Indeed, it was a just and splendid judgment of God that this place should be filled 
with the blood of the unbelievers, since it had suffered so long from their blasphemies. The city was filled with corpses and blood."" 

""Our men followed, killing and slaying even to the Temple of Solomon, where the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles.""

""Then our leaders in council... ordered all the Saracen dead to be cast outside because of the great stench, since the whole city was filled with their corpses; and so the living Saracens dragged the dead before the exits of the gates and aranged them in heaps, as if they were houses. No one ever saw or heard of such slaughter of pagan people, for funeral pyres were formed from them like pyramids, and no one knows their number except God alone.""

Europe:

""At the beginning of summer in the same year in which Peter and Gottschalk, after collecting an army, had set out, there assembled in like fashion a large and innumerable host of Christians from diverse kingdoms and lands; namely, from the realms of France, England, Flanders, and Lorraine. ... I know not whether by a judgment of the Lord, or by some error of mind, they rose in a spirit of cruelty against the Jewish people scattered throughout these cities and slaughtered them without mercy, especially in the Kingdom of Lorraine, asserting it to be the beginning of their expedition and their duty against the enemies of the Christian faith. This slaughter of Jews was done first by citizens of Cologne. These suddenly fell upon a band of Jews and severely wounded and killed many; they destroyed the houses and synagogues of the Jews and divided among themselves a very large amount of money. When the Jews saw this cruelty, about two hundred in the silence of the night began flight by boat to Neuss. The pilgrims and crusaders discovered them, and after taking away all their possessions, inflicted on them similar slaughter, leaving not even one alive.""

""The Jews of this city, knowing of the slaughter of their brethren, and that they themselves could not escape the hands of so 
many, fled in hope of safety to Bishop Rothard. They put an infinite treasure in his guard and trust, having much faith in his protection, because he was Bishop of the city. Then that excellent 
Bishop of the city cautiously set aside the incredible amount of 
money received from them. He placed the Jews in the very spacious hall of his own house, away from the sight of Count Emico 
and his followers, that they might remain safe and sound in a very 
secure and strong place. But Emico and the rest of his band held a council and, after sunrise, attacked the Jews in the hall with arrows and lances. Breaking the bolts and doors, they killed the Jews, about seven hundred in number, who in vain resisted the force and attack of so many thousands. They killed the women, also, and with their swords pierced tender children of whatever age and sex. The 
Jews, seeing that their Christian enemies were attacking them and 
their children, and that they were sparing no age, likewise fell upon 
one another, brother, children, wives, and sisters, and thus they 
perished at each other's hands. Horrible to say, mothers cut the 
throats of nursing children with knives and stabbed others, preferring them to perish thus by their own hands rather than to be killed 
by the weapons of the uncircumcised. From this cruel slaughter of the Jews a few escaped; and a few because of fear, rather than because of love of the Christian faith, were baptized. With very great spoils taken from these people, Count Emico, Clarebold, Thomas, and all that intolerable company 
of men and women then continued on their way to Jerusalem""",False,0,KotakuInAction,,1,SupremeReader,,t5_33726

A bit annoying is, that you probably won't be able to get permanent citizenship (in the EU) if you just come here to work.

Since you aren't persecuted and your life isn't in danger in your current country, it's very likely that your application will be rejected anyways.

&gt; Black Flag is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California, United States, largely the brainchild of Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes.

&gt; Keith Morris was their original lead singer. He left the band suddenly in 1979 to form the well-known band, Circle Jerks. Ron Reyes was the second singer for the band, but decided to leave the band not too long after. Dez Cadena would be their next singer, but switched to second guitar when they found fourth and final singer Henry Rollins in Washington D.C. in 1981.

&gt; While Black Flag were - and remain - very respected among their underground culture, their music has not been the stylistic model one might expect, in spite of their formidable reputation. Rather, their influence was seen primarily in their tireless promotion of a self-controlled DIY aesthetic. They're often regarded as pioneers in the movement of underground do-it-yourself record labels that flourished among the 1980s' punk rock bands.

&gt; Over the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved in ways that alienated much of their early punk audience. They were part of the first wave of American West Coast punk rock, are considered a key influence on Punk culture band, and are especially important in the creation of hardcore punk. Their later sound, however, was often reminiscent of proto-heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.

&gt; The band broke up in August 1986, when Greg Ginn decided to quit.

&gt; Through seemingly-constant touring throughout the USA and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established an extremely dedicated fan base. Many other musicians would follow Black Flag's lead and book their own tours, utilizing a word-of-mouth, grass-roots network.

&gt; On January 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Greg Ginn and vocalist Ron Reyes would reform Black Flag, joined by Gregory Moore on drums, and 'Dale Nixon' on bass (Dale Nixon is a pseudonym sometimes used by Ginn, most prominently as the bassist on My War). The band will tour as well as release a new album, their first since 1985's In My Head. In March of that year, it was announced that Screeching Weasel bassist Dave Klein joined the band. On May 2, 2013, the band released a new song entitled ""Down in the Dirt"" through their website.

&gt; Around the same time, it was announced that the lineup that played at GV 30, Morris, Dukowski, Stevenson and Egerton, would tour performing Black Flag songs, under the name FLAG. It was later announced that the lineup would be joined by Dez Cadena. Read more on Last.fm.

So you wrongly assumed that I am referring to America's sins with the goal of equating them to Russia's, or to stop your reference to Russia's sins. That is untrue. I repeat again, I am merely putting forward what I believe follows logically when we examine issues like geopolitics. In this case, that is: if we are looking at how bad the Soviet Union was (which is, according to what you say -- correctly, let me say -- is the reason why the Eastern Europeans joined NATO) how can we also look at the alliance into which they had joined and not shiver? This is not ""whataboutism"". 

Let me put forward an analogy:  Mr. A is a rich corrupt businessman giving an interview with a reporter. During the interview, he is asked about corruption and how to fight it. He goes on to explain how it's important to fight corruption, and particularly points to Mr. B for being excessively corrupt. In great detail Mr. A explains how corrupt Mr. B is, and everyone is shocked.

Now, I think most people will agree that it is highly hypocritical for Mr. A to discuss so much about Mr. B's corruption while pretending like his own is non-existent. I also think that, to question him of his corruption *as he is going on about Mr. B's corruption* is completely legitimate and valid.

Basically how it works is that everyone is obligated to have a basic healthcare insurance the price of which (around 1200€ per year) is determined by competition between the insurance companies. The companies have the obligation to accept anyone regardless of health, nor can they cancel someone's insurance. The basic insurance covers most of the important parts of health care such as hospital stays and visits, prescription meds, prosthetics, etc. Things such as dental care, physiotherapy, more expensive glasses and alternative medicine can also be covered through optional extra insurance packages. The insurance companies negotiate the prices of health care with the hospitals. When you consume care (with the exception of GP visits) the first € 385 are paid by the patient, the rest is covered, with some small exceptions.

On the other side the government determines the precise coverage of the basic insurance, and also helps fund the system through taxes on income. Furthermore, long term care for people that need constant help or supervision is fully funded by government and some limited copays.

So we have the income tax funded part reminiscent of single payer systems, but also the market systems for both insurance companies and hospitals.

Rest of your posts certainly raises valid points about the advantages of market systems, but in the end it is also a matter of opinion. I'd personally vastly prefer a system with some wait times for non-urgent care to a system where some people cannot afford care at all.



&gt;My colleague who came from the UK told me that 'giving chemo in the UK is easy, nothing is covered'. Every though the UK has 'universal access' for chemo like most nations, the access to the options is limited because chemo is expensive, especially new options, so they don't cover those. So do they 'cover' chemo, or don't they? You decide.

Yeah, the UK has quite strict criteria for when something is covered , which is decided by NICE. It needs to be cost effective, that is, a certain effect is not allowed to cost more than a certain amount of money. This is inherent to any system with limited funds because you need to chose at some point between spending 100k on one patient to extend his life a few months, or spending the 100k on for example vaccines for a thousand babies where it may have a much larger total effect. Again, this is opinion, but I would rather have basic chemo for everyone than super expensive new chemo only for those who are rich. 

&gt;BTW, how do you think the chemo agents that the UK (or other european nation) 'funds', got invented and produced in the first place? Where do you think that happened? Why did it happen there?

I am assuming that you are trying to say that they only exist because the pharmaceutical companies can charge outrageous amounts of money in the US, but I don't quite agree here. If you look at how much money these companies spend to suck up to physicians and on other such 'promotional' stuff, and how much profit they make then I think the only conclusion is that they could also still be profitable in an environment with lower prices. See also how many drugs are inexplicably cheaper here than in the US, for example the same concentration and amount of a drug called rituximab is 277€ here, $879.00 in the US. Similarly, etanercept €127.50 here compared to just over 500$ in the US.",False,0,television,,1,n23_,,t5_2qh6e

E.g. large fraction of Roma among the convicts, but more non-Roma Romanians among the actual *inmates*. 

This would also rhyme with [this anecdote] (http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1240&amp;recType=story):

&gt; Romanian criminals in Italy have followed a similar path to those from Albania. They arrived in massive numbers in the late 1990s and started performing the crimes that Italians no longer wanted to do. These included high risk and visible crimes such as prostitution and larceny. [...] Nicoli [Second Department of the Central Operative Service in the Italian Police] says that many criminal organizations from the Balkans have a background that can include military training, and a **readiness to use violence**. [...] **This was not a Romanian Roma group. Nicoli has never seen Roma groups involved in structured or organised crime in Italy**.

&gt; In the Turin example, he says there is a full tree of a military organisation with a figurehead and a second line of command. [...] The robbers were recruited from Romanian orphanages and, according to prosecutor Giuseppe Creazzo, were trained in robbery in an “academy of crime”.

&gt; The press has stated these men belong to “a paramilitary group of over 300 men trained to pull off robberies across Europe” [...] This credit card fraud has a high incidence rate, but peaked a few years ago. These are **criminals who move around a lot, because they do not want to draw attention. But they are not Roma**.

I do agree that the article could have been written much clearer (and with links to the data as well). But leaning back once the first emotionally pleasing hypothesis can be constructed is not good form either. 
The linked article by the way also mentions the Roma issue in a few unsatisfying lines. 

The general gist would also rhyme with the rumors I heard about Romanian criminal bands in Germany. Those were generally not mixed up with the ""Zigeuner"". The Romanians (following the Albanians) were usually seen as the most problematic, particularly in rural areas.

t1_d9h4r1l,1478027780,1481123598,d9h8ezt,False,0,,t3_5abfz0,"One of the salient features of the Soviet planned economy that is easy to overlook was that it was big. The Soviet economy operated as a near monopoly on all ends of the productive process. There were always nooks and crannies to find resources and squirrel away excess materials. This reserve capacity gave Soviet managers enough latitude to make meet their quotas, and as /u/Smilin_Dave correctly notes, barely exceed their targets. 

Accessing this reserve was easier said than done. Obviously, maintaining reserves of materials was illegal by the state, but this was a violation of the law that was honored more in breech than practice. Industrial managers often operated in an incredibly complex web of bartering and under the counter transfer of material from other concerns. This too was also illegal, but often necessary to make the system run. One peculiar element of the Soviet economic system was the *tolkach* (pusher), an individual with connections and knowledge of the system. *Tolkachi* would sometime balance the needs of several firms at once with strategically placed bribes or other gifts, all the while employed at a sinecure or other paper title. Although the *tolkachi* were very much creatures of the Stalinist era, they were a persistent factor within the Soviet economy through 1991. There was constant harping about bribery in the Soviet press and periodic anti-*tolkach* campaigns. 

But maintaining a *tolkach*'s services was a necessary evil for Soviet factory managers as these sort of grey market methods were needed to meet quotas. The Kosygin reforms actually enabled this by *khozraschet* system of self-accounting. This allowed managers greater leeway to allocate resources within their charge with the expectation they would meet, or exceed, their production targets. This method of accounting had been pioneered in the NEP period of the 1920s and had fallen into disuse after the 1930s. The Kosygin reforms' reintroduction of *khozraschet* shifted a degree of localized power onto the managers. In theory, the *khozraschet* system introduced a level of accountability and incentives in the Brezhnev era, but practice showed that it helped enable some of the chronic problems of the stagnated Brezhnev economy. 

These various methods all allowed the Soviet planned economy to function, but not at the growth rates of the earlier postwar periods. Soviet consumers had unparalleled access to amenities like cars, televisions, and other consumer luxuries in the 1970s, showing that at least the system sort of functioned,  but access to these goods lagged far behind the West and the gap was growing. More dangerously for the USSR, the Brezhnev era started to rely more upon fossil fuel sales to Western Europe as a revenue stream to make up for shortcomings in the domestic economy. As oil and natural gas prices fell in the 1980s, this revenue stream dried up, making the problems of dysfunctional Soviet economy more acute.

I disagree.

I believe it is. Why can't I claim the US is more corrupt than Canada? You going to stop me?

Also you could argue that the US tax base is different from Europe. Because Medicare isn't wholly paid from payroll taxes, the brunt of the cost is foisted on income tax payers or debt issuance. The working class and middle class don't pay material income taxes so they don't have a big incentive to control Medicare costs. The European middle classes get hit with VAT to pay for their healthcare system and European countries can't run large deficits because of the Mastricht treaty and because they don't control their own currencies.

&gt;I said Medicare and Medicaid inflation versus private sector health cost inflation, and that's the part you need to explain.

I've explained it ten times. You're not listening. The government tightly regulates private insurers and forces them to pay for many different procedures. Once they legally have to accept these procedures, they have no negotiating power.

Lastly, I never argued that the private sector has done a good job. I've argue they've done a terrible job. Your reading comprehension is very poor. I think other OECD countries have much better systems than us. I've said this over and over and over again.

Oblivion and Skyrim are similar games, though. Both of them share levelling, but Oblivion has more RPG elements, such as character creation, the class system, weapon durability, and the like. The enemies are more generic European fantasy, and there are Daedric quests, but they require you to find the Daedric shrines rather than have someone walk up to you and start the quest for you. There is a Fighters Guild, an Imperially charted organization with the intention of training mercenaries, instead of the Companions, and the Mages Guild, an Imperially charted organization with the intention of using magic for the benefit of the Empire. The Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood are in both games. The main difference between Skyrim and Oblivion that I noticed is race; Skyrim is obviously incredibly Nordic, but Cyrodiil is incredibly cosmopolitan, with different cities mirroring the different provinces; Cheydinhal for Morrowind, Bruma for Skyrim, Leyawiin for Black Marsh and Elsweyr, etc. The races are all more or less treated completely equally, as racism isn't as extreme in the heartland of the Empire.

The difference between Morrowind and Skyrim is extreme. There are many more factions in Morrowind than in Skyrim, with three combat factions, four stealth factions, and four magic factions, as opposed to only one. Morrowind also uses the RNG for almost everything; your potions have a chance to fail, weapons have a chance to miss, spells have a chance to fail, lockpicking is determined randomly, speechcraft is determined randomly, etc. It's a true classical RPG; if you're not trained in a particular skill, you will *suck* at that skill. Race-wise, there is definitely bigotry in Morrowind, seeing as it is the home of the Dark Elves, and there isn't a Daedric quest for every single Prince. Fast travel also doesn't exist, but teleportation spells do.

They are all very different games, and they are all very good. Don't listen to the people who tell you to wait for Skywind and Skyblivion; playing the original games and those gameplay mechanics is just as important as the story and world of those games.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/955c15f465d64ccb80881ea3436cbf9c.png)  

&gt; Dokken is an American hard rock / heavy metal band that was formed in 1978. Having big success in the 80s with tracks such as ""Dream Warriors"", ""It's Not Love"", ""In My Dreams"", and others, they sold over ten million albums worldwide yet faced internal battles over their direction. The group split up in 1989, having accumulated numerous charting singles and earned a Grammy nomination, and they've had sporadic reunions since then.

&gt; Dokken was initially composed of founder Don Dokken on vocals, George Lynch on lead guitar, Juan Croucier on bass, and Mick Brown on drums. The southern California group pursued a heavy yet melodic sound reminiscent of prior bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, finding success in the 80s hard rock and metal boom. The band recorded and released 'Breaking the Chains', their first studio album, in 1983. Though their fortunes struggled somewhat in the United States, they picked up a big popular response in Europe.

&gt; In 1984, Croucier left Dokken in order to join Ratt. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Jeff Pilson, who soon became a rock idol alongside Don Dokken and George Lynch. Their next several albums and singles showed them to be a powerful commercial force, particularly winning fans with their music videos (their one for ""Dream Warriors"" even featured the band facing off against Freddy Krueger himself). Their 1988 live album 'Beast from the East' earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance as well. However, Don Dokken's and George Lynch's creative differences, as well as their growing personal conflicts, brought about tension and even caused the group to break-up in 1988, though they had released multi-platinum work appealing to numerous hard rockers and metalheads.

&gt; The band has faced many changes over the years since. It wasn't until 1995 that the group resurfaced and released new material, facing a rather tepid response. As time went on, only Dokken and Brown remained from the original line-up. After several personnel alterations on guitar, Dokken's former attorney Jon Levin even stepped in to fill the role in 2004. In 2009, Sean McNabb (formerly of Great White and Quiet Riot fame) took the bass guitar slot. Mark Boals (formely of Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force) then took McNabb's position in 2014.

&gt; A series of successful web commercials for Norton Internet Security 2010 put the group back in the spotlight, the comedic spots depicting the band as a malicious computer virus. Dokken's tenth studio album, titled 'Lightning Strikes Again', was released on May 13, 2008 via Rhino Records. Several critics recommended the work as a comeback to their 'classic' sound. The group's latest work is 2012's 'Broken Bones'. Read more on Last.fm.

Swords were a backup weapon for if your pointy stick broke. Catapults were only for when you reached a castle. Armor protected you from pointy sticks. The colosseum was for entertainment, and guess what: a lot of the people inside fought with pointy sticks. Even after gunpowder, for years the most frightening weapon on the battlefield was the bayonet, which turned your gun into a pointy stick. Pointy sticks were the main weapons of war for most of human history.
&gt; 

I'm sorry, but this is just insane. Hell, you even mentioned castles, which were incredible fortresses that themselves required architecture that nobody in the sub-saharan could produce.

&gt; You said that the residual effects of segregation and slavery would be mocked. Are you saying that the residual effects of segregation and slavery included no discrimination somehow? I mean, that's the biggest, most obvious effect I can see. Hell, segregation WAS discrimination writ large. And here you are saying that discrimination is a big thing!

Residual effects of slavery and segregation are that blacks are a protected group, that blacks have affirmative action and other racial preference advantages, that blacks can't be portrayed negatively in the media without it causing a shitstorm, etc. They are all positive, which is why Western blacks are the most well off and educated blacks found anywhere in the entire world. It is the *opposite* of discrimination. It's whites bending over backwards to help them and giving them so much help that it would be nearly impossible for them not to do significantly better than whites, if not for racial differences in intelligence.

"" Well, attitudes like that make it hard for me to want to hire him for any position where he may deal with single moms, the police, the military, any minority, refugees especially, and cheering on terrorists kinda is a catchall for stupid. Are you still going to hang this on the SPLC being unfair? I'd say he got what he deserved.

How is anything you just listed, other than the terrorism thing which is satire - ramzpaul is a satirist, any different from ""not being progressive enough"" ?


&gt; Who did they lose it to? 

Europeans who then treated them incredibly for the most part. We gave them back land, we give them racial advantages in hiring and college and what not, we don't collect property taxes from them, etc. We also give them access to our science, technology, law enforcement, etc. It's an unprecedented level of kindness from one race to another.

No, you just showed that we don't get credit for it. Nobody here is saying whites get credit for their good deeds.

White nationalists and neo-nazis are tiny in number and even smaller in institutional power. White supremacists probably don't exist at all. So yes, the opposite of discrimination.

The American plan called for a thrust towards Halifax in Canada to cut off British reinforcements. At the same time forces would push into Winnipeg to cut Canada in half while yet more troops capture Vancouver because it is the largest and thus most vital Pacific coast city.

The Canadian counter plan was basically to push into the US as far as possible then destroy as many bridges, dams, and other infrastructure to slow down the inevitable American advance. From there they would wait for British reinforcements.

The British themselves had never actually planned on holding Canada in case of such a war. They believed the much more populace US would eventually overwhelm them. Instead the British opted to place their confidence in the Royal Navy which was lager than the US Navy at the time. They would then engage in a series of Naval battles to maintain colonial commerce.

Later historians and military experts have determined that basically the US could capture Canada but may not have been able or willing to go much further then that.

If such a war took place the USA would likely take heavy initial casualties. British leadership was just far more experienced, organized, and better trained. They would also be operating with probably the best spy/intelligence network of the era (think MI6 and the cracking of the enigma code).

Once Canada is taken; the war will quickly turn to holdings in the Caribbean. Fighting would likely cover Cuba, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Grand Cayman, etcetera... Here, the Royal Navy has a very good chance at crippling the US Navy which could set America back years. Despite the US having a much larger industry it would still take them along time to build up a fleet.

In the end the USA will come out on top because of larger population and industry.

The only caveat is including Allies. Most of Europe would almost certainly favor the UK. Simply because the US is a major threat to European dominance and colonial powers. Even Hitler believed that a war between the US and UK was inevitable and there are confirmed comments of him favoring the UK. Because Hitler believed the UK was more ""Germanic"" while the US was an immigrant cesspool.

I’d like to point out that I believe numbers should be questioned constantly, most of all in China. The problem is I do see the middle class in tier 1 and 2 cities living extremely well, compared to 10 years ago especially. The fudged numbers can’t be far off because people here have disposable income and save a large portion of it. Businesses continue to boom, infrastructure is continually built, it’s all very different to back home in the US.

&gt; Further, I think it's just not accurate to say that China is looking 30-40 years ahead.

I think you misunderstood what I had hastily wrote, my bad. The CCP has 2 ""100 year plans"" to set China as the world hegemony, and so far they have succeeded in quite a few of those goals despite everyone’s reservations. Not only have they cut down on poverty at a laudable rate, they also are preparing the future, such as encouraging business to deal with Africa to have a presence in the next resource heavy part of the underdeveloped world. In terms of internal saving the Chinese government has “Rainy Day” weather money to overcome most financial storms, especially the looming housing bubble similar to the one that destroyed Japan. Despite being a corrupt behemoth, the CCP is easily working efficiently with the people's well-being in mind.

The anecdote you linked is an inadequate example in my opinion because it shows what people on an individual level do, not what the government does. The government’s job is to think ahead, while people with income can spend it how they want. To counter the Evan Osnos piece, I’d also like to bring up that renovation is part of the Chinese way currently. From my friend’s and family’s experience with buying and moving into apartments, it’s expected to renovate the place as soon as you move in. Construction and materials are cheap, so why not? As another counterpoint, I would like to say just because it isn’t part of the culture we’re used to, it doesn’t mean it is worse or wrong. We can say the same about our flimsy US wooden houses compared to the brick and stone houses of Europe which were built to last. Doesn’t mean the US is worse for using those materials (imo yes it does but I’m speaking from a general POV). Also why else would I hear an angle grinder cutting away every morning at 8 am.

Now we reach the bottom, the poverty stricken mostly western China. I know it's a simple anecdote, but when I worked in ShenZhen I actually chose to live with these “migrant workers” under the misnomer of sweatshop workers, and was surprised how happy they were to be working and how informed of their situation they were. They knew that they were there to make money for their families in their rural towns, but it was by choice that they came for the opportunity. Everyone has a smartphone and place to live, decent food on the table, and when we went out at night it was to the park to dance (free and I was horrible), or to the roller rink (10 yuan  for an hour rentals) it felt natural and unburdened. It’s more than possible to enjoy life with friends and family without spending crazy money, therefore allowing one to save it for family. Even drinking can be done cheap with huge bottles of beer going for 2.50 yuan.

As manufacturing shifts further west I believe there will be less migrant work coming to the major cities in the east because they will be able to travel far less distance to get work to jobs. The industrial revolution China can be seen like a wave, travelling eat to west as a way to bring people up from poverty into the middle class. Some parts of China like Xinjiang and greater XiBei area are still waiting on their chance, but they also are reluctant to grow like the rest of China AND are poorly placed for international trade, making it less than ideal to change to right away. From talking to people the feeling I get is that the Chinese people know the government pulled their parents out of poverty and they continue support the government as it strives to do the same for the rest of China by 2020, compared to your idea that they’re fixated by fear of returning to poverty.

As for CCP being perfect? No, of course not. Seeing what they are doing first hand is amazing though compared to the US which can barely pass a bill without leeches being stuck on to them. If the CCP is thinking of the greater good, which records show they’ve done exceedingly well so far, theres no opposition needed to force them into anything. Do I have confidence they will continue to spread the wealth? Yes. As the middle class because more educated, the growth in knowledge will lead to public opposition on its own, but I haven’t seen the need for it yet OTHER than the wild corruption within the government.

Are those police crackdowns mostly justified? I would say by Chinese standards yes, they go against the “unity / for the people” mantras of China. Examples: The Dalai Lama is a powerful figure supported by a powerful religion that sadly is NOT as perfect as everyone likes to believe. Islam is a plague that breeds extremism and unrest in the Xinjiang areas. Falun gong is an obvious pyramid scheme cult that has no place in China (or the US either) and deserves to be persecuted. Sadly with that, journalism and free speech that I enjoy so much in the US have to be censored, but it’s a sacrifice to make China the rising power that it is.

Cortez actually attacked and defeated a Spanish army sent to retrieve him. If Cortez and his soldiers had been slaughtered by the Aztecs it would not mean war against the Spanish, it would mean a rebelling general was killed doing the very thing that he had been forbid.

While this might be true, I don't think that the outcome you describe is reasonable at all. Absolutely nothing in contemporary or future European colonial history indicates that had Cortez failed, that the governments would have started diplomatic relations and never attempted military conquest again.

&gt;Also the major amount of depopulation only occurred once the Spanish controlled the area and used the population as slaves. If the Spanish had not conquered the Aztecs there would still have been high amounts of death due to disease but not any where close to what happened historically.

This is just no where even close to correct. Disease is estimated to have killed 90% of the pre-Columbian population. Mesoamerican civilization was basically doomed the second they allowed Europeans to wander around for a few months, everything afterwards was just details. The Spanish might have systematically slaughtered or enslaved tens or hundreds of thousands over the century following Cortez, but that is barely a patch on the millions that died off due to disease. 20 years after Cortez's hypothetical murder and Mesoamerica and all of its treasures would have been up for grabs for the next greedy European adventurer to come along.",False,1,eu4,,6,TocTheEternal,,t5_2uqat

Each location will have a specific kind of wireless router with a limited subset of MAC addresses.

Most likely those that share the same MAC address are the ones that ""trade"" data with each other. Now, IP address would be the identifier for a ""unique visit point"" as to satisfy the 8-hour limit before a new data transfer can take place for a specific 3DS.

Chrétien was heavily criticized in 1995, for not having done enough soon enough, nearly loosing what most were predicting would have been an easy victory. Cameron's arrogance likewise was the reason the Brexit was a surprise victory.

Referendums aren't the measure of the everlasting will of the people. They are a snapshot of the will of the people, at that present moment in time. As are elections, but at least elections elect people with the possibility for rational thought. Referendums elect fixed ideas, with no margin for amendments or adjustment. People will react to public pressure or changing circumstances, for example. 

To reuse the Brexit vote, that's the difference between a pro-Brexit referendum and a pro-Brexit Prime Minister. The latter can adjust to a changing landscape. Prime Minister Boris Johnson might have had to change his mind, after negotiations with the EU makes it clear the cost is to great for Britain or that it's going to force Scotland to leave the union or that public opinion seems to be shifting, possibly costing him his reelection. Instead, we have Prime Minister Theresa May who feels she has to push through this, no matter what.

It's why, in my view, that no referendum can be held at a meager 50%+1. It isn't representative enough of the will of the people; it's only useful to tell us the debate has merit. The margin of error is to great to draw any other such conclusions from an outcome like this one.

t1_d9hab9t,1478031761,1481125595,d9hbwbc,False,0,,t3_5ais5g,"cara, primeira coisa, não acho que isso tem que ser. discutido em termos de ""Direito"" (com letras maiusculas, entendido como o sistema de organização social que inclui, mas não se limita, às normas legais), por muitos motivos. o Direito é resultado de uma marcha histórica que existe há milênios, e que só reconheceu o direito de greve de trabalhadores em 1988, quanto mais o de estudantes. o Direito já protegeu escravidão, assassinato em defesa da honra, tortura, monarquias absolutistas, racismo em sentido amplo, etc etc etc.

veja, até a atual constituição Federal quando trabalhadores faziam greves o Exército e a polícia eram chamados e faziam o que o exército e a polícia fazem, atiravam nas pessoas (um exemplo entre muitos https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_de_Ipatinga)

até a lei da greve, que é garantista, tem vícios.

outro motivo é que o Direito brasileiro é desconexo e confuso, dá pra usar ele pra defender A ou B sem nem piscar. o STF decidiu recentemente, por exemplo, que é possível prender alguém após a segunda instância, mesmo a CF falando expressamente ""não é possível prender alguém até haver trânsito em julgado"" - e há trânsito em julgado somente quando não é mais possível recorrer. 

por isso eu sugiro que debatemos isso dentro do campo do direito, com minúscula, e da moral. dentro de um conjunto de regras sociais não escritas que garantem o respeito mútuo e a cooperação, que tal?

nesse ponto, eu não acho que é possível o direito de não adesão em caso de greves estudantis, como regra de boa convivência, na mesma medida em que se você está no seu trabalho e toda a equipe decide realizar um projeto de uma determinada forma, nada te impede de dizer ""não vou fazer, o artigo 5o, inciso II da Constituição diz que ninguém é obrigado a nada sem ser por força de Lei, e não tem Lei que me obrigue a fazer esse projeto desse jeito"". isso é tecnicamente verdade, mas você está infringindo regras tácitas de boa convivência, não está?

da mesma forma que se os alunos se juntam em uma assembléia estudantil e decidem pela greve, poucas pessoas tem o poder de frustar a decisão, tudo que elas tem que fazer é aparecer para a aula. de volta à analogia do trabalho, você pode achar o jeito que os seus colegas decidiram realizar o projeto muito ruim, mas você não vai lá e simplesmente deleta todos os documentos do computador, apesar de você poder fazer isso.

o curso de ação adequado nesse caso parece ser tentar convencer os seus colegas de que o jeito deles não é o melhor, e se eles não se convencerem você tem todo o direito (em minúsculas!) de pensar que eles são todos uns grandes idiotas e que a sua ideia é melhor, mas você não vai unilateralmente frustar a decisão da maioria, correto?

veja como isso é antidemocrático! centenas de alunos se reúnem, debatem, deliberam, e aí no fim, uma dúzia deles tem o poder de simplesmente tornar a deliberação nula.

The best shorthand for understanding it is probably to think of it as a very loosely organized feudal state, where each vassal is about the same rank as those around them, but the Emperor is really ""first among equals"" more than he was truly in charge. If the Emperor wanted to declare war, he had to go to his vassals and ask for money to do it with, and they'd periodically just refuse, claiming the cherished principle of ""German Liberty,"" aka ""the right for me to do what I want."" This could be a major, major problem - sometimes they'd refuse to help the Emperor even when there was an existential threat to the Empire, because if you're say on the northwest corner of the HRE, you're at little risk of the Ottoman invasion. And of course the electors picked the next Emperor, usually based on a mix of their own ambitions and how much they'd been promised as payment for voting for one guy over another. So it was really more like a despotic oligarchy, of which the electors / vassals were the oligarchs.

The King's main income came from the hereditary Habsburg lands in Austria, as did his personally-commanded troops. While significant, those resources did not enable the Emperor to go rampaging around Europe as we often do in-game. Furthermore, HRE minors / electors generally had territorial ambitions of their own, so they weren't particularly keen to lend troops / money to the Emperor if he wanted to conquer areas that they would rather have themselves. They would usually help during a defensive war, but offensive wars to expand the King's dominion were very unlikely to get vassal support. So, for example, the standard tactic in eu4 of playing Austria and forcing PU on both Bohemia and Hungary within 15 years would have been completely impossible, not only because you wouldn't have had the troops, but the other HRE members would have withheld support and possibly revolted in protest over the blatant landgrab.

That said, the Emperor's role was more about prestige and symbolism than raw power. He was invested by the Pope and retained a close connection with the Papacy, so there was an incentive to at least pretend that he held more authority than he really did, because that's how the late feudal system worked. 

It would be really hard to accurately model the HRE - scholars still don't really agree 100% on how the system functioned - so it's understandable that EU4 uses shorthands. That said, I think EU4's shorthands give Austria much more power than they had historically, making it easier for them to blob.",False,0,eu4,Map Staring Expert ,5,albacore_futures,,t5_2uqat

The current situation is that the representatives of way less than 1% of the EU population can veto anything imparting their sovereignity. And seven of the national parliaments are already representing less people than Wallonia. In a federated union that would only be possible from 35% onwards. So it's complete bullshit to pretend that something like a 90-95% acceptance rate for treaties with a scope outside the EUs competencies would be worse than the current situation.

I have no idea what your point is. Countries can disagree with a mixed treaty, because they have to be a full-fledged member to it, yes. Who is talking about federating? What does acceptance rate for treaties have to do with qmv?

&gt; The qmv limits are okay for dealing with the small unimportant day-to-day issues

No, the ordinary legislative procedure is used for that. QMV is used for important things.

You are right about the Merkel being elected indirectly, the more you know, thanks. So your problem is not the EU directly, but the election system and democracy used currently in most European countries. Fair enough, that is something to fight for.

When I talk about Singapore with some of my friends from Australia and America, I always end up feeling proud to be a Singaporean. It's sometimes exactly for those reasons that you listed, that I feel proud of Singapore.

One of the most glaring and obvious achievements Singapore has is it's airport. Our airport has been consistently voted the best 4 years in a row, and for good reason.

We also boast a multi-racial country only a handful of other countries can boast about. That's definitely an achievement i feel proud of.

My friends always comment about how Singapore is so much cleaner and organised compared to their country. I agree, have you ever walked in Hong Kong? Lovely people, amazing food, but you can get lost so easily there, and the streets are definitely alot less pleasing to the eye. Traffic is insane and you just see grey everywhere.

We can also go into the less obvious things Singapore has done for the 'greater world' that you speak of. 

Singapore is one of the leaders in going green. We have the highest building sustainability rate in SEA and one of the highest in the world, and many other countries including the US and the UK, as well as members of the EU, are coming to Singapore to learn about going green.

Our education and stance on the arts leaves much to be desired, but our science and engineering faculties are ranked some of the highest in the world. An NUS degree can be compared to some of the ivy league degrees. 

At the end of the day, Singapore is still a growing country, our media and politics have alot to work on, and our arts scene is a total mess. But I'm still proud to say that I'm a Singaporean.

Now there is NO perfect criminal stat to capture ""street fights"" - I get that.  But the BEST AVAILABLE option I could come across was looking at the number of assaults that are reported.  Yes, a better stat would be great.  If you can think of a better AVAILABLE stat, then please let me know.  But I can only use what I have.

In any case, the stats overwhelmingly support my statement.  For every 1 assault in Germany in 2014, there were 1.8 assaults in Ireland and (amazingly) 4.3 assaults in England/Wales.  Given these stats, and assuming you don't have better stats, can't you at least concede there may be something to this.  Yes, you can explain away stats (maybe its immigrants who are fighting, etc), but shouldn't you also use stats to support propositions.

Elizabeth and her council left more information that give a good sense of their priorities, but much of what happened outside the court is difficult to discern. 

The protestants in England wanted Elizabeth to support the Huguenot cause in France, which Elizabeth attempted to do in 1562-1563 (though Elizabeth was probably as motivated to recapture Calais as support the French Protestants). The result was a crushing defeat for England, and made Elizabeth less willing to intervene in French affairs (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 66-67). 

The major international concern for most Catholics and Protestants in the early years of Elizabeth’s reign was the succession of the thrown. Since Elizabeth was the last surviving child of Henry VIII, should she die without an heir, the crown would pass to her cousin Mary, Queen of Scotland. This Mary was granddaughter of Henry’s older sister, and though only 16 years old, was a committed Catholic. This remained a major concern for Protestants in England, despite Mary’s removal from the throne in 1567. Mary remained a threat to the church in England until her execution in 1587. All the concern over the religious wars on the continent tended to take second place to domestic concerns, and to the succession of the English crown (Alford, *Early Elizabethan Polity*, especially chapter 2).

England and Spain both wanted to keep a positive relationship with one another. Spain, for her part, wanted to keep Mary off the throne of England, because that would endanger Flanders and the Spanish Netherlands (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 64). Besides that, Philip sought to obtain a Habsburg-Tudor marriage alliance. There was a division in Elizabeth’s court between a pro-Habsburg group that was more conservative, and a more radically protestant group led by the Earl of Leicester (Doran, “Religion and Politics at the Court of Elizabeth I”, *English Historical Review* 1989, pp. 908-909). The early failure of marriage negotiations was more about difficulties of a foreign suitor than his Catholicism. The negotiations dragged on for years, and eventually failed entirely because the two sides could not come to an agreement on religion.

There was some popular discontent against the pro-Spanish policies of Elizabeth. The most obvious was the independently financed pirates/privateers that raided or traded in Spanish territories in the Americas (Andrews, *Elizabethan Privateering*). It was only in the mid 1570s with the revolt in the Netherlands and successful harassment of Spain in the Atlantic that Elizabeth took a more anti-Spanish position. Elizabeths continued support of men like Francis Drake, and support for the Protestants in the Netherlands was what drove Philip to war against England (Doran, *England and Europe*, pp. 76-77, 85-87). 

By the time that England's elite were willing to wage open war against Spain, the population was sufficiently committed and converted as well. The real result of the Armada was that it convinced Englishmen that they were the superior nation, that God had made them the victors in 1588. It gave the hotter protestants greater motivation to plant Roanoke in NC (then called Virginia), to attempt their own invasion of Spain that failed miserably, and eventually to the sack of Cadiz in 1596 that cemented the Englishmen's high opinion of themselves. 

Again, it's hard to track where the population lie on issues of international dispute. The dislike of foreigners was not unique to protestants, but it did help them fan the flames against possible Catholic suitors for Elizabeth, or help them advocate for the execution of Mary.

Well I think we are operating on different assumptions. I assume Corbyn will go if he loses a GE barring a situation where the government looks likely to collapse shortly after a GE, and I mean if he got that close then you pretty much would be wrong right? haha. And I think even if he tried to stay he would fail, I think he'd lose the support of even his allies and tons of supporters. I don't know anyone who wants him to stay long after 2020 if he doesn't become PM including some veteran Bennites! But I dunno what the wider mood among his supporters is.

So I think pretty much reached a deadlock in discussing it because we are both working on assumptions about what will happen if he does anything short of winning or losing by a tiny tiny margin.

I guess what I just don't get is if Corbyn is as bad as you feel, then 200k people campaigning for him is only going to save seats, it is not going to massively change the overall outcome in all likelihood. Obviously if Corbyn is just 'not good' then it could but your verdict on him is obviously far more negative than just not good. It seems like you're saying he's just bad enough to be total shit but not quite bad enough that a few extra seats won't be enough to convince people he should stay (implying that a few seats less might be enough to sway people's minds).

&gt;The worst bit is for the first time in my life I live in a marginal, so my campaigning may actually help save my MP's seat. Rather her go and Corbyn resign then me help her win and have Corbyn stay on.

Might be that she loses her seat and it has no impact on whether Corbyn goes or not though. I dunno for a moderate it seems a pretty radical solution haha.

&gt;And if we win enough or we don't lose enough Corbyn is likely to stay on and his supporters aren't likely to change their mind. So really letting it all either succeed or fail on it's own is pretty much my only option. 

Well I just hope you and the other people with your beliefs have predicted the very fine line between being tactical and cutting off your own nose to spite your face right. Because obviously if you havn't you have just added to whatever damage you think Corbyn is going to do. 

Also your opinions on his supporters assumes they are pretty blindly dedicated to him no matter what. But if that is the case you are fucked anyway aren't you? If people are that dedicated then are extra seats gonna make that much of a difference to their opinion? And have you weighed in the possibility that the loudmouthed ideologues are a small minority of those actually supporting him? 

Obviously maybe I'm wrong, it is just my anecdotal experience, but outside of rallies nearly all the Corbyn supporters I've met are not hardcore devotees or people with little understanding of politics.

As for all the stuff about the moderates backing him that, rather like the EU, is a ship that has sailed. Either Corbyn would have been equally fucked with their support or things could have gone better. Eitherway any damage that may have been done by infighting and lack of unity has been done and can't be reversed now.

I was writing in the pre match thread about how this was our 90 minutes of justice, the one and a half hour ruler by which we'd be measuring ourselves in terms of European rankings; I think we can safely say that City's officially lit a fire under the ass of European football.

The scary part about this performance was that our finishing - and sometimes the final pass - was absolutely dreadful and we should be looking at something like a 5-2 or 6-2 win if all 22 players on the pitch had been sharp.

If we get that incisiveness blended into our game we'll well and truly be up there.

A couple of notes that came to mind after the match was finished:

*Raheem played beyond his young age for us for perhaps the first time and showed a big-game mentality that to me was truly impressive.* There's showing up in the big games, and then there's showing up in the **massive** games - I think it's safe to say how massive this one was, and he definitely showed up at a time where frankly I was half expecting many of the older players to take more of the spotlight. His pass to Gundogan for our first was exemplary of this mentality.

*Stones can play his game against even the biggest giants in Europe.* You may be thinking that I'm wrong with his amazing (/s) through ball to Suarez at one point, but that's a mistake that you expect from a young defender who has been thrown so thoroughly into the deep end of elite football that we might as well have anchored him down the Mariana Trench - truthfully I was expecting Kompany to feature despite his fitness. I'm not excusing the play, but what I am saying is that he's got the look of a future star Ball-Playing Defender about him because he's so cool and confident in even the most dire situations.

*We're closing down the passing channels much more effectively.* I'm absolutely convinced Pep must've been running 'pressing drills' én masse with the lads, because our pressing has been woeful at times in previous games, but for tonight it turned out to be a top class effort both in terms of the stamina it took to close down the channels that much, as well as the positional awareness to (almost) always close them down fully.

*Aguero's coming to terms with Pep.* I've never thought Aguero has been bad under Pep so far, but I have been worried about when exactly the philosophy would bed with him. He's looked a bit disinterested at times and seemed to play more for himself than for the team and the overall plan that Pep has been trying to drill into the squad's heads. He showed it at West Brom, but tonight Sergio fully convinced me that he's on board with the system. He pressed the backline beautifully with the rest of our interchangeable forwards, and it caused a lot of stress for the second-string Barca defense.

*KdB will be our 'Messi'.* I realize how daft I sound saying it, but truly I think that his potential ceiling for where his football can go is higher than anyone else's in the entire squad, even Kun. His off the ball movement and intelligence on the pitch are truly a joy to watch, combined with excellent technical skills and a mentality that has rarely let us down when we needed it most. He will never be as good as Lionel, but I'm certain that when he does peak under Pep, he'll have gotten pretty damn close to the highest echelon of football greats like CR7 and Messi.

*Zaba will always find his way into our hearts.* If I was running MCFC, his attempt to rouse the crowd alone would've made me extend his contract. Truthfully, even though it might be for the best, I fear the day where he is no longer with us.

The rest of the stuff I think kind of explains itself. Gundogan is a special talent but for the life of me I can't figure out how he always ends up at the end of all those final passes. It's probably blasphemous to call him a Lampard who can pass the ball but that's how he's made himself out to be so far, and I'm loving it.

Because of my position, as a guy who lives in europe, is from a relevant cultural background, and who used to be a caribbean-region sovereign debt economist, I'm kind of in a special position to share insight on this question. It also puts me on BOTH sides of this issue. 

I want to start by saying that while I don't usually elaborate which specific European country (because I'm tied to THREE of them), I'm make the exception of naming them, just this once, since they were definitely slave-trading colonial nations, but they also **definitely got reparations from Germany**. To be specific. France, Belgium, and Holland. 

What I can say is that:

1. We've seen reparations done right, and we've seen them done badly. it's important to know the difference. 

2. As a ""Belgian"", we definitely got money and land from the Germans after WWI and again after WWII. Also, we definitely owe most of our current wealth to the resources extracted from the congo. we used guns to steal it. now they have nothing. we kinda owe it. In the same way, the Germans used guns to steal lots of our stuff (and our people). and that was the basis of our claim for reparations from germany. 

2. Current French and Dutch fortunes are more than definitely based on well-invested profits gained originally slavery and colonialism in various parts of the globe. Slavery was big business. So were the cashcrops such as sugar, rum, rubber, tobacco, and cotton. It generated a lot of wealth, which is still present today. Anybody who visits central Amsterdam (or Brussels) will notice that most of the large, fancy infrastructure was built during that period in history. with funds drawn that way. 

3. France demanded and got reparations from slavery. **From Haiti**. Can you believe it? They demanded compensation for ""lost human capital"", which resulted from the haitian revolution. Paying that off bankrupted Haiti until 1947, when they finished paying it by handing over the majority of their yearly budget. 

4. **Reparations are about righting past wrongs which, still have their economic effects today**. With all of that said, I realize that simply handing over cash doesn't actually right the wrongs. It just impoverishes the party who pays. Look at what happened to Germany and France. Germany got desperately poor after WWI, but France didn't get fabulously wealthy. 

5. Righting the wrongs, IMO isn't about transferring cash. it's about sharing the means of production, and about guaranteeing economic access. That's what we got from the Germans after 1945. It has made Belgium, Holland, and France fabulously wealthy, and it hasn't broken the Germans economically, and today's generations definitely feel that wrongs caused by past German aggression have been dealt with. 

6. In a similar vein, the demands of caribbean nations towards europe today, vis-a-vis slavery, are exactly those. that Britain, France, and Holland share the means of production, and guarantee economic access. Simply transferring cash isn't going to do much for all the tiny places in the caribbean who were ruined by slavery &amp; colonialism. But help with industrialization, human capital formation, and protected trade access to the EU markets definitely would. 

7. At an individual level, in a place like the US, the question should ALSO not be about money. it should be about access. ",False,0,CapitalismVSocialism,Classical Economics (true capitalism),2,bridgeton_man,Capitalist1,t5_3cct3

Trump wants to deport ILLEGAL Immigrants, who are taking up residence, and money, without paying proper taxes?

In short, Trump is a better option on a foreign and domestic level.

I don't want to live through WWIII either, but let's say that in 2017 Russia attacks Lithuania. What then? While it would perhaps be insane to start WWIII because one nation of less than 3 million people was invaded, failure of NATO to implement Article 5 (an attack on one is an attack on all) would render the entire alliance useless, leading to further destabilisation and the potential break-up of NATO, a destabilised Europe, enormous loss of international prestige for the USA and its ability to stand up for its allies and interests not just against Russia but all over the world, and further chaos. If NATO is not serious about defending Lithuania, then perhaps Kim Jong-Un might get the idea that they are not serious about defending South Korea either. It's an extremely tricky situation.

The only reason the nuclear deterrent works is that the other side believes you are serious about using it if necessary. Putin is calculating, hard-nosed and sly, but he is not insane and would not carelessly start WWIII. At the moment, he's pushing at the boundaries and seeing what he can get away with - sending submarines into Swedish waters, for example. Hillary is also not insane and I believe she understands this game quite well. Paradoxically, it is the nuclear deterrent that saved the planet from a potential WWIII for decades during the Cold War. And that's where we find ourselves now yet again, and why NATO are conducting military exercises in the Baltic.

I began in alaska, with nearly no food but plenty of iron, gold and silver. I had a very rough start dealing with all the barbarians and the global unhapiness of my cities. 
Quickly, as i started to settle Canada, my civilization flourished. At that point i realized that Siam, my nearly neighbour, and his allied city-states occupied the rest of North America. So, by the middle of the Medieval Era, i declared war to them and unified the continent under my rule. I only kept a military city state, Belgrade, as an enclave in my empire so that they could nourish my forces.

The rampage continued in the Renaissance, when i decided to invade Chinese South America. Beijin fell quickly to my troops, and i only left them with one city. 

At that point in time i owned 3 capitals on 8, i had the lowest unhapiness, no wonders, average science but all the kills got me enough culture to finish many policy trees. 

Then, i started to have intercontinental ambitions so i send a colonial force take over russian africa, taking their capital as well as some other cities, while i settled siberia with cities that could be helpful in case of an invasion of the German that lived there. Helped by the ever-so-expanding (nearly 20 original cities from arabia to china) we took over Bismarcks land.

The first A-bomb fell on our land when Greece declared a surprise war against us while we tried to exterminate the Germans. Then, the Nuke-race begun, and the front stayed put around mongolia. Finally, brave paratroopers took over athens, and poor Alexander signed our peace treaty. 

Only two capitals were left for the taking. European Japan and autro-indonesian arabia. As i was already sending troops to my japanese border, i saw a notification i didn't care about at that time.

If there are no APP shops, I'd recommend that you look at piercer profiles to look for quality including implant grade jewelry, straight piercings, and healed examples of their work. 

2. Honestly, if you are very very careful and take care of your piercings extremely well, healing will be a breeze. I've had mine since May and they are (I would say) almost entirely healed. What I did to heal my nips included wearing bras pretty much constantly for the first couple months, cleaning every day by spraying Neil Med wound wash saline on them and when needed (like after sweating, etc) and I NEVER touched them. NEVER. I can't stress it enough, litha.

3. If you are eventually planning to have both pierced, then I think doing them at the same time is awesome. Half the healing time!

4. My piercer, who is an APP member, did mine while I was on my back lying down. I promise you, a good piercer who is experienced with nipple piercings will for sure be able to make them symmetrical and even. The piercing is done lying down to make it easier for the piercer to accomplish this. 

5. Implant grade only. Mine are Anatometal titanium in 12g. My piercer told me he prefers to do only 12g but depending, 14 may also be appropriate. 

6. I've lost more than 30lbs since I got my piercings and my breasts have gotten at least a full cup size smaller. In my opinion, they look even better on me now that I'm smaller because I feel like they stand out more. But I loved them just as much when I was bigger, too!!

7. If you take great care of your piercings by cleaning, not touching them, and just generally keeping them happy and healthy, there is a low chance that irritation bumps will form. I have never experienced this on my nipples, but on my nostril, all I did was make sure to treat it like a new piercing. I know some people will recommend sea salt soaks, but I think that depends on the severity of the bump.

8. My nipples, jewelry included, cost ~$100 + tip (but depending on where you are and if tips are customary, it may vary)

9. Most healed piercings will never completely close, meaning that if you choose to take out the jewelry, the piercing will collect dead skin cells. If you were to squeeze at them, it would come out. However, unless you are very close up to the nipple, the holes should not be obvious.

10.  You can remove the jewelry to breastfeed if you choose to have children. If the piercing is performed correctly, you should have no complications.

Now, let's look at the numbers. First of all, official statistics for 2015 showed no increase in the crime-rate, overall. So the new-comers weren't more criminal than the Germans, on the whole. Daily Mail claims however, that this has dramatically changed. For this, they have exactly one source: an [article from Gatestone Institute](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9229/germany-lawlessness). It's author, Sören Kern, claims that the number of offences committed by immigrants has risen by 40% within the first six months of 2016. Now, Sören cites a number of secondary sources, some more, some less credible. His only *primary* source, though, is the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). Let's have a look at [what they have to say](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Nachrichten/Kurzmeldungen/kernaussagen-kriminalitaet-im-kontext-von-zuwanderung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile):

&gt; The number of offences by migrants have fallen by 36% within January and June 2016.

&gt; In the first half year of 2016, 142,500 cases concerning criminal offences (including attempted offences) were registered, where at least one accomplice had been a migrant.

&gt; The development of case numbers was distinctly in decline. The most significant drops occurred in the fields of larceny, offences against sexual self-determination, offences against property and forgery. 

Now, that's just amazing! Sören's only primary source claims a drop of 36%. So Sören writes, there's a rise of 'nearly 40%' in crimes commited. Don't know about you, but I think, this is where the whole article comes crashing down.

Lastly, let's look at Sören's previous write-ups. After all, it's entirely possible that the +40% / -40% thing was just an unfortunate mishap:

Some European countries do offer free university studies to any students who qualify for the courses. Mostly it's limited only to people from the European Union though.

You need the necessary grades/qualifications to get in. You may need to do some additional tests/an interview, especially as you're coming from a foreign system.

There's a big catch though: a lot of these courses are in the country's native language, especially at the undergraduate level. 

Also Europe mostly uses the term ""university"", ""college"" is just used as a synonym for highschool. 

&gt; Do you hehe to post for the flight there?

Assume you mean ""have to pay"", yes of course. You'll also need to pay for accommodation and food. Depending on the uni sometimes you'll be in-campus accommodation, off campus university accommodation or in independent accommodation (ie find your own living arrangement). 

Some countries offer a stipend or low interest loan for studies, but these likely aren't available for international students. It still may be (much) cheaper to go to university in a European country though.

One of the most ahistorical things I've seen.

&gt;Can you name these principles please?

I can give a brief rundown, certainly. (Short of time- I apologise.)

One of the cruxes which characterised Anglo-Saxon society (I am here referring to the earlier Anglo-Saxon regions) is that of the locality, with those of the community being a part of the shared, organic culture and heritage (this is not to say that those of other cultures were immediately shut out- I'll expand upon this later). Those who were wealthier and praised were those who had proven themselves worthy of the merit (most of the time, at least). People worked and laboured within a framework which was generally more horizontal and mutual in its attitude, and furthermore operated in a better alignment with the natural world. Customs pertaining to a religious outlook on the afterlife, fluid as they were, also warranted esteem amongst these ethnic communities. Those things, for me, are the crucial ones.

There is something else I would like to clear up. I am not claiming that the Anglo-Saxon people constituted a single, much less a ""pure"", race. Personally, I do not believe that such things really exist. White people all have a mixed lineage from different areas of Europe, coming from slightly different (in terms of culture and ethnicity) backgrounds. However, they are white nonetheless. And as for the comment which I wanted to expand earlier, those Irish and ""native"" British people had cultural values which were altogether similar to those of the Anglo-Saxons, hence why there are parallels drawn and consequential developments between these different peoples of those regions. 

EDIT: I also wanted to add that this is why I speak not of literally turning back the clocks. Instead, I am answering certain questions and calling for a resurgence of certain core and organic values from cultures and peoples which thrived for thousands of years. I identify most strongly with the Anglo-Saxons for various reasons, although these things I've mentioned had existed in Europe and Scandinavia for a long, long time. Capitalism, as we have it today, is still within its birthing stages insofar as the history of the world is concerned.

Making patients pay something for use (like € 385) would be a great idea for us.  Payment and consumption need to be linked.

In the US, hospitals and health care networks actually have more leverage and more incentive to negotiate than even in Holland.  The reason they don't is due to government legislative action which has prevented this.  A market system would have not have these barriers.

You rightly stated meds are cheaper there.   The reason why is above.  But I think you missed the point.  They exist because mostly American companies created them.

I will grant that academia has not considered this as much of a problem recently. But I've talked to a lot of people who still believed it is.

Also, your reasoning with the overpopulation works to an extent, but it is not the final answer. The two variables of population size and quality of living are linked, but it is more so because people decide to have fewer children as they become more affluent and because they gain access to contraceptives. Both variables contribute to each other, but its not like decreasing the population will automatically increase welfare.

The opposite problem is a declining population. Many European countries are starting to experience this, but is already a huge problem for Japan. 

Like I said, there are areas that have overpopulation challenges, but it is just not the case on a global scale. Having an extra kid in any European country or the United States will not contribute to a global overpopulation problem at all.

Pretty ashamed to say I've nearly 1K games and I never fully grokked the fundamentals, but hey, learning is learning. Better late than never.

I recently had a loss on Braxis Holdout and while I died 5 times (looking back, ALL of these could have been avoidable if I had played safer and not done really dumb stuff, but i'm trying to improve bit by bit), we still kept up with them in talents until the end, though a few choice kills by the enemy team basically sealed our fate.

There were at least 2 moments pre level 10 and post level 10 where I had the nagging feeling I should GTFO and help my 4v5'ed team, but I stuck to my guns to get us over the line for talent tiers. In hindsight, I'm really not sure if I went completely the opposite way and ignored my team in dire need (not that they all got wiped, of course). Thinking on it now, I should've helped my team post level 10 and upped the ante against the level 12 enemies (**especially** since the objective was up and top beacon was being contested... Doh!). :P Common sense is in short supply, I guess, but I think i'm improving myself - that above point is something I really have to keep in mind: Stick With The Team AFTER LEVEL 10.

Good luck with that guide! It sounds like ALOT of work, I hope it can come to fruition.

t1_d9gsn7a,1478050653,1481137905,d9hr5us,1478053981,0,,t3_5abj10,"&gt;While there wasn't a formal way for a nation to leave the EU until 2009, I don't think there would have been a EU ""Civil War"" if a state left.

&gt;But if a major state like Texas were to withdraw, they simply would not be allowed to. It wouldn't result in a civil war, because Texas doesn't have a standing army (like states used to), there is no mechanism to permit states to leave either, so it would be illegal and the Federal Government would send in the army or police. That's not ""anyone's guess.""

I agree that a member state leaving the EU prior to 2009 would not have precipitated a civil war, hence the examples of Greenland and Algeria, whose relationship with the EU was in some ways comparable to Puerto Rico's relationship with the US.

I do though stand by my statement that it's 'anyone's guess' what would happen if, sometime in the future, a process began in some US state with the end goal of seceding from the union.

One sees examples of this all over the world; some attempts are relatively orderly and proceed based on a legal framework negotiated between the national government and the government of the region considering secession (e.g. [Scotland's 2014 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) on leaving the United Kingdom, or [Quebec's 1995 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995) on independence from Canada).

Others are resisted by the national government and deemed illegal, such as the ongoing attempts of the government of [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence) to seek independence from Spain, or the ultimately successful attempt by [South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Sudanese_independence_referendum,_2011) to become independent from Sudan, which involved a civil war.

If a plausible secessionist movement became established in a US state and obtained the consistent backing of the majority of the state's population, the parties involved would have to make decisions about how to proceed. One option - the one you describe - would be for the Federal government to ignore it, or declare it illegal, and perhaps deploy armed forces to intervene if the state government violated Federal law.

Another option would be to strongly discourage secession without use of force (e.g. threatening economic sanctions). Another would be to peacefully seek an accommodation short of secession. Another would be for the US Congress to legislate a formal process for the issue to be considered, perhaps involving a referendum, as was done in the UK, Canada and elsewhere.

Which of these options would be the most likely would depend entirely on the circumstances at the time, which I think it's reasonable to say would be 'anyone's guess'. This would be a future that has not yet (and may not ever) materialise.",False,0,DaystromInstitute,,1,JProthero,,t5_2whek

I was talking about how the average inhabitant of the Byzantine Empire would identify throughout the history of the empire. The island in question (Lemnos) was inhabited by Christian Greek speakers, not Muslim Turks. The whole conversation between the soldier and local children, as reported by a Greek historian, took place in Greek.

The average Muslim inhabitant of the Ottoman Empire would most certainly not identify as a Roman, although some of the monarchs (like Fatih Mehmet) claimed to be continuators of the Roman tradition. 

As for primary sources that disprove the Ottoman-Fascist analogy, de Busbecq and  Wortley Montagu come to mind, although there are many more. These two were European diplomats who visited the Ottoman Empire respectively in the 16th and 17th centuries. 

The books I cited in the earlier comment have plenty of primary sources (mostly written in Greek, but translated by Kaldellis and quoted in his narrative). Chapters 4 and 5 of *The Byzantine Republic* are particularly relevant to this conversation.

1) The economy is the #1 topic on every civilian population's mind in every country around the world... pretty much ALL the time.  You can't really distract them from it.  That's like saying you will distract a lion from its dinner by putting a baseball game on the loudspeakers at the zoo.

2) If Russia *did* want to ""distract"" its people from their tanking economy this way, why would they completely deny any involvement in the conflict and downplay its effects on their state media in an attempt to distance themselves from it?

3) The reasons for the invasion of Ukraine were to preserve access to the warm water port at Sevastopol and to destabilize Ukraine for the indefinite future so as to stifle any attempt by the new government to court the EU and NATO.  A destabilized Ukraine can't attract investors, can't begin any process toward joining EU, and can't solidify internal support for the new regime.

Ukraine is Russia's crown jewel satellite state and the overthrow of Yanukovych represented the West quite literally knocking on Russia's door and taking over their most prized foreign possession.  It's a geopolitical coup of almost unparalleled magnitude.  That's why Russia invaded... not for some bullshit ""distract the people"" conspiracy that doesn't make sense on ANY LEVEL.  Invasion couldn't even accomplish the purpose you're claiming.  Russia's economy is still foundering and the Ukrainian conflict is yesterday's news.  The only ""distraction"" it caused was to cause Russians to have to face the fact that their people were involved in a new foreign conflict and they were facing international condemnation and international sanctions because of it.

The campaign was tinged with racist appeals to nationalism.  It didn't dominate the election debate anywhere near as much as I see it being reported it did in the press, but it was there and it did have an effect on the way many people voted.  This was primarily because the racist elements within the otherwise quite legitimate Leave campaign didn't appeal directly to race issues, but referred instead to 'immigrants', so as to seem as if they were talking about the real problems which exist around the Syrian refugee crisis.  But in truth this was used as way to nod and wink to the 'coming over here, taking our jobs' element, who read the Daily Mail and Rupert Murdoch's Sun tabloid.   The Sun is read by around 13.6m people every week, which in a country with a population of 64 million people is readership of about 8%.  The Leave campaign won by 52%.

What surprises me is that, as you say, the racists for Trump have taken a much more open approach.  If they'd been a bit more behind the scenes about it, perhaps people wouldn't have noticed.  So in a way it's a good thing that they're being so blatant - because it leaves no doubt that he's quite deliberately using a dog-whistle approach.

**Local NA Talent:**

* **Sneaky:**  I'm going to immediately break my rule because there is no way he'd leave C9 just like Bjerg isn't leaving TSM.

* **Stixxay:**  Has looked very good in international tournaments and during the summer split.  Great mechanics and looks really good positioning in team fights.

* **Dark horse candidate:  LOD**  He had very good statistical measurements for an ADC while being on a pretty poor team (at least during the 2nd half they were poor).  I think he's going to be a very good NA ADC for years to come

* **Piglet:** I know TSM wanted English speakers only but things change, especially if a monster ADC is calling you.  I'm not sure where his mentality is but he would be a great great ADC player to have.

* **Challenger ADCs:**  I personally don't think Regi is wanting to go this route.  I really believe he's looking for a superstar.  Would love for some up and coming challenger ADCs to be groomed in a Challenger TSM team though.

**EU Talent**

*  **Rekkles:**  I think he's similar to Sneaky, in that he will be loyal to Fnatic.  He's left them once and realized his mistake.  Fnatic has groomed him since he was 16 so I think he'll never leave them again.

* **Forgiven:**  I'm not sure the validity to the claims that him and Sven don't get along but winning usually trumps everything.  We do know that he really wants to come to NA and tried to join CLG last year.  I think if he's motivated then he would be a dream pick up.  He's a true carry that would instantly fill Doublelift's void.

* **Zven:**  It's apparent he is a package deal with Mithy and they are really committed to G2.  We couldn't get them anyway unless we drop Sven, which isn't happening.

**China/Korea**

* I don't think any of them would come to NA instead of China tbh.

* **Deft:** Since people are mentioning him, I will say that it was obvious that TSM and EDG were heavy scrim partners and they heavily bragged on Deft often.  The only possible way this happens is if Deft is content with the money he's made in China and also doesn't want to try for his best shot at winning it all in Korea.  The lure of Los Angles and the US has brought over some good talent but this is the equivalent of a hail mary pass.  He would obviously be #1 choice in the world imo.

* **Uzi:**  Isn't he getting paid big millions?  Yea, no chance.

My realistic picks in order (considering language and intangibles/shotcalling): 

* Forgiven

* Stixxay
* Piglet

* LOD

I think Doublelift claiming on stream that he is intending to come back in the Summer and be a ""beast"" may hurt TSM get a really good player for the spring.  TSM is trying to offset that worry by offering a tryout but it's still unsettled for whoever joins.  Our team will grind hard for months with a player and will bond with them.

As for American whites, absolutely zero sympathy because this land doesn't belong to them in the first place.  It's really funny to see American whites bitch and moan about Europe getting brown even more so than the Europeans themselves.  This bitterness towards Europe by white Americans was a wake up call for me on how racially tribal and biased they really are despite their liberal tropes.

You seem unable to separate an explanation of why someone ELSE did something in the 1930s with my personal opinion of how it should be done in 2016. They are not the same.

However, for a start how would moving her to another community help? The whole assessment of the situation was based on the perception and probable observation that girls with no strong male familial ties within these groups are vulnerable, this would have been true across all the aboriginal communities, even more so the futher she got from her original family. Also you're assuming that there existed some sort of structure that could identify and locate safe havens and then support her there. There just didnt. 

Concerns about the kids wishes and 'fundamental' human rights barely matter now, they were irrelevant back then. What about the fundamental right not to be left somewhere that white people know you're going to raped? 

The only options being Probable Rape vs Reeducation WERE the only two. This isnt a theoretical discussion about what we'd like to occur when we play the game from the start, this is what was available at the time. There were no social workers for aboriginals, or even Australians, and there were no structures in place to control and manage these situations. Many Aboriginal communities were largely isolated from the European ones and generally lived their stone-age hunter-gatherer style social structures. They were slowly being educated in the 'modern' ways but mainly by some form of Osmosis. There were Aborigines at the time who were almost entirely westernised and some who had not even met white man yet. There was no coherent plan for this situation.

Do I have concrete evidence? Of course not, the evidence would have been largely anecdotal based on observation, little or no modern style analysis was done of these situations. I have read letters or notes that suggest the men in charge believed these things to be true, and it also falls into a pattern, not well documented cos of its unsavorieness, whereby indigenous cultures dont have the same sexual inhibitions and beliefs that christian westerners did. These communities wouldnt have even been, in many cases, untouched and 'pure', but encampments where the Aborigines had been corralled, leading to the usual stress and breakdown in controls that occur in such places.

My implicit implication (sic) is that the people in charge believed western life to be 'normal' and desirable. Your assumption is again to believe that explaining why Hitler thought and acted in some way means that I think the same thing.

You'll note your own implicit racism in assuming that a child born of a native parent and a white parent is intrinsically still a native and thus moving her to her other culture (the white one) is moving her away from her actual culture.",False,0,todayilearned,,2,Thecna2,,t5_2qqjc

Fair enough if you'd like to see a Prequel game. Many would.

Based on my sparse tests so far I'd say slightly inferior image quality (disregarding graphics complexity) compared to the PSVR, despite the higher screen resolution. But that was to be expected of course.

Almost no games that look tempting to pay for, but it does have some of the same video content apps as the PSVR, such as Vrideo and Within, as well as much nicer virtual cinema and gallery apps for watching movies or photos in nice virtual surroundings. Although I suspect I probably won't be doing that on the Gear VR either, since I feel the video quality - on both systems - is really to low to imagine watching an entire movie that way.
There's full support for 180 and 360 degree videos in SBS and TB 3D of course - which works very well (I tested with Moonplayer, for some reason it seems like the Samsung VR Player I've read about is not available here in Europe) - but so far it seems to me that that's mostly suitable for a certain type of video content.

I can't really say in all honesty that I feel that either headset is something I would like to wear for even an hour without a break or two, although overall the PSVR does have the edge.
No cables (except for headphones) on the Gear VR is bliss though. And if I actually were to start using VR for video content - and the media player on the PS is improved - it feels like less of a commitment to snap the phone into the Gear VR and put it on, than loading up the PS4, the PSVR, drag chair and cable extensions around.

Nevermind though. They are obviously systems in two different classes. Definitely the PSVR for gaming, but I can certainly see myself favoring the Gear VR for some other things.",False,0,PSVR,Mike9Million,1,Mikkel9M,psvr,t5_3102i

It's slightly true but there are some things you can change.

America was traditionally white because of it being found and populated by Caucasian Europeans, but it has evolved into a melting pot especially in Americas industrialized period. The America during this time was actually not a majority of white people because the immigration of others from different countries had gone on the big rise and there were many different colored folks from other countries that have created many more colored folks. saying that America is primarily white right now is not true due to the massive amounts of colored minorities that have come and lived in America through generations during such times as the industrialized period.

I just don't ever feel like part of my life is being controlled, or, I guess, I just have other concerns. Maybe through some mix of a persons natural and learned behavior, they have more of a resistance to the idea.

Now, to be clear, I'm not saying I want government control in the sense of someone actually interfering with my life in any sort of immediate sense. But the amount of government interference in my life right now is acceptable. I think, though I haven't tried it, that I would be happy with more interference a la the way some European countries do it, but again, if it's simply taxes we're talking about, my wife and I are teachers and I think we'd stand to gain monetarily from such a situation. It also isn't really feasible because our country is so diverse and I honestly do not believe that the different people would come together enough for that sort of system to work.

And, yes, I do get preoccupied with that, and I think that white people are the institutional root of that problem, even though I'm white, and I'm not blaming every white person nor do I walk around feeling guilty or anything like that. 

It's like global warming. It's just a thing that has happened because our ancestors (and here I mean most people, so far as I know, when able, and not just white people, of which there are many ethnic variations, etc.) were kind of savage, being people, and that we're in an age where big strides against that sort of thing could be made.

It's for philosophical reasons that I believe in all forms of pluralism and even, to some degree, politically correct language in public forums because that's helpful. I don't think of it as a form of control because I'm complicit with it. It's not as if our government isn't liable to entirely shift directions, so while our current government seems rather politically correct, I would be anyway and independent of politics, exactly.

Back to the point, I think you would have to be a deep down fucked up person to ""celebrate abortions"" though, and I just don't see or understand why Clinton would. I just don't believe it, inherently, because I don't know anyone who honestly enjoys the notion of abortions. I mean, like, maybe the kind of dude who watches gore videos all night and takes bath salts or something? I met people sort of like that playing in a metal band in college. But Hillary Clinton? It just rings a huge ""Why?"" bell. Like a lot of the claims.

She fucked over Bernie, sure. That I totally expect. She's part of the political elite you mention. They can certainly be viewed as hacks. I feel like we both know that people are probably getting into politics for good and bad reasons, people being complicated. I guess what I'm saying is that she seems pretty ruthless, as politicians go.

But doing all the extravagant things that aren't even reported on by NPR, which I take as about as objective as we're going to get, I don't buy it. How do you get to be president if you're doing the odd and lavish things implied by some of the stories you've mentioned. Like, tabloid stories will arise regardless, but why risk it over something like taking money from a foreign dictator for favors? That's not what a person with her eyes on the top of the political arena does. 

Keeping secret emails so you can run your secret plans on winning elections and stuff? Yeah. I get that. It's not, like, the coolest thing a presidential candidate could do. It doesn't make me think she would govern any differently than the rest of the political elite hacks she deals with, as they seem to be pretty lock step. She's just going to do what Kerry or Biden would do, in terms of policy, so her being ruthless isn't really the problem.

It sounds stupid after what I just said, but I think she'll just do the job. The kind of bonkers stuff she's done that is actually proven, it only shows she wants the spot. I assume it's an ego thing as much as anything. None of this elicits strong feelings from me. Like you, I care more about my party's platform. It's just that we feel the opposite way.

You'll notice and likely be annoyed by my sort of blase attitude toward the particulars in talking about her. I'm sweeping it under the rug, essentially. But I would feel the same if she were running against your standard GOP politician. Against Trump, I have an additional set of worries because the man doesn't think before he speaks or acts. Combine that with his greedy nature, and yikes. That's a different order of magnitude than talking about Clinton, Rubio, Biden, that creepy looking guy I can't think of his name, Cruz, and so on.

A lot of people in this country thing Clinton is a higher magnitude of problem. I think it's because she's a woman without the sort of features (physical, personality wise, etc.) that really plays to an American audience and the presidency is and always will be picking the homecoming queen, in terms of how people vote.

Also, land which has nothing on it whatsoever is **a lot cheaper** than land beside developed stuff. And when you have a network of railroads and trains, everything is a lot closer.

The projects appearing to be operated for commercial purposes under front names for the Finders.


“There was one file entitled ‘Pentagon Break-In,’ and others referring to members operating in foreign countries. Not observed by me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the Finders. The process undertaken appears to be have been a systematic response to local newspaper advertisements for babysitters, tutors, etc. A member of the Finders would respond and gather as much information as possible about the habits, identity, occupation, etc., of the family. The use to which this information was to be put is still unknown. There was also a large amount of data collected on various child care organizations.


“The warehouse contained a large library, two kitchens, a sauna, hot-tub, and a ‘video room.’ The video room seemed to be set up as an indoctrination center. It also appeared that that the organization had the capability to produce its own videos. There were what appeared to be training areas for children and what appeared to be an altar set up in a residential area of the warehouse. Many jars of urine and feces were located in this area.


“On Thursday, February 5, 1987, Senior Special Agent Harrold and I assisted the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) with two search warrants involving the possible sexual exploitation of children. During the course of the search warrants, numerous documents were discovered which appeared to be concerned with international trafficking in children, high tech transfer to the United Kingdom, and international transfer of currency.


“On March 31, 1987, I contacted Detective Jim Bradley of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). I was to meet with Detective Bradley to review the documents seized pursuant to two search warrants executed in January, 1987. The meeting was to take place on April 2 or 3, 1987.


“On April 2, 1987, I arrived at MPD at approximately 9:00 a.m. Detective Bradley was not available. I spoke to a third party who was willing to discuss the case with me on a strictly ‘off the record’ basis. I was advised that all the passport data had been turned over to the State Department for their investigation. The State Department in turn, advised the MPD that all travel and use of the passports by the holders of the passports was within the law and no action would be taken. This included travel to Moscow, North Korea, and North Vietnam from the late 1950s to mid 1970s.


“The individual further advised me of circumstances which indicated that the investigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter. The MPD report has been classified SECRET and was not available for review. I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks prior and that the FBI Foreign Counter Intelligence Division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI Washington Field Office of anything that had transpired.

1) Friend of mine, ESL teacher, broke his collar bone playing football. Had company health insurance, decent but local insurance.

They sent him to an international hospital. Obviously, he needed surgery. However, the insurance couldn't cover the surgery in the international hospital, so they transferred him to a decent local Chinese hospital. To give you an idea, the surgery was about 2 to 2.5 times more expensive in the international hospital. And the insurance plan had a ceiling of how much could be covered in in-patient expenses.

The surgery went well, except that he woke up during surgery. They put him right back under when he woke up but still. The anesthetist didn't bother to ask his weight or possible allergies and just ball parked the dose, which is very much NOT ok imho. The rest was fine and he healed normally. But giving the wrong dose could mean you never wake up due to overdose or allergy.




2) Other friend of mine, Chinese wife was pregnant. She had a routine check-up in Chinese hospital. Doctor tells her that the ""seal"" is a bit too wide and the baby could fall out to early, but this can be sewed up again and this is a simple routine operation. You get a number, you go in, the surgeons have a fixed amount of time to do your surgery and then you need to be out. 

Later during a trip back home, they did a check-up in their home country. Gynecologist has to break them the bad news. Their unborn baby has died because they botched the surgery in China. While sewing her up, they punctured the womb and too much fluids were lost. They didn't bother to tell her after her surgery in China, probably figuring it was gonna be ""ok"".  (Don't know why they didn't sue the Chinese hospital but tbh, not really a fun topic to discuss and didn't want to dig out more from my friend than what he wanted to tell me.)

So yeah, pretty messed up but shows how in Mainland, you are not a patient but you are a number, a task, that needs to be ""processed"" in the allotted time, rather than being taken care of properly no matter the amount of time.


These are two non made up experiences from close friends of mine. Make of it what you will, but be warned.

The biggest overarching worry I can think about is China trying to develop an alternate world system to the one that was put in place by the West after WWII (and the one that was put in place by the USSR after WWII which has now come undone). Such a competition between international systems could lead to a race to the bottom in certain institutions (like international lenders and wire services) to at worst the creation of a new bipolar world like the one we had seen during the Cold War.

This is not only a threat to America (but not necessarily a tangible threat yet), but any country that is not outwardly anti-western. However, America has shouldered most of the burden protecting this system in the postwar era, which is why China is often presented as more of a threat to America than the rest of the world (though we are potentially seeing more collective action against China from western nations nowadays, especially when it comes to the openness of capital accounts as we have seen the US, Germany (who has also proposed EU collective action), and Australia introduce more scrutiny and demand more reciprocity for Chinese foreign investment).",False,0,geopolitics,,2,elev57,,t5_2qhnn

1. The number of people who describe brexit as [""leaving Europe""](https://www.google.com/#safe=active&amp;q=%22leaving+europe%22+brexit)

4. The European Space Agency, which would like you to know the [history of Europe in Space](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history) does not include Russia.
5. [many debates like this one that I just found by a quick search which make clear that while we disagree, it is not so simple as I am wrong and you are right.

&gt;The US is highly ""traditional"" and Americans really love choppers. How outrageous/likely would it be for you to keep alive the VRod for Harley Davidson (assuming Harley is killing it next year).

Not in the cards

&gt;What about the European market were people are a bit sportier? When are you planning on invading Europe?

Presently the company is focusing domestically. While there is great market potential in Europe, the biggest hurdle is the requirement of ABS which EBR is still working on but can't do cost effectively right now.

&gt;Will prices be driven up soon? 12k$ for a 180hp Buell! Jesus Christ! Is this real life? How is that even possible?

That I cant answer with certainty, but much of it is due to EBR being a very lean running operation right now. The factory is small, and every employee can fit in a single van.

&gt;Is the Buell Ulysses dead? Any plans of reviving it under EBR? Keeping in mind that ""Adventure"" bikes are best sellers or in some cases the Flagships of certain brands (BMW has become super famous not because of its supersport or supercruiser but because of the 1200GS).

EBR is staying away from this segment at the moment due to how much competition it has. Given the small operation and limited resources they have now, they have to choose wisely what they do next (which will be shown real soon).

&gt;Now that you are not under Harley Davidson...how likely is it to develop a brand new NON V2 engine?

Very, Erik is not required to make a twin, and even under HD there was a 3 cyl and a Rotax based single in development. Twins work great for streetbikes, but aren't the only option. He has designs for several engine configurations and each has their ideal application. One of them doesn't even have cylinders.

Then, it's okay in my book to dislike nuclear energy.

We don't want another limited resource when investing in renewable resources is inevitable anyways, so we might as well start now.

* Stopping weapons from getting into the middle east instead of continuing the pointless wars
* The green new deal
* Ranked voting
* Single-Payer healthcare
* Free education
* Defunding countries that commit war crimes

But sadly none of that is going to happen anytime soon because politics has become a reality TV show and the two-party system is corrupt and actively suppresses ranked voting, so 3rd party candidates cannot get air time and cannot win due to strategic voting.

I'm foreign and I don't wear hijab here and I basically run around in a t-shirt and jeans and it's totally fine. According to the law here, women can wear what they want, but it's still advisable to wear clothes that cover elbows and knees, especially in more conservative areas. But in other more liberal areas (say Jabal al Weibdeh or Abdoun), it's not uncommon to see people wearing shorts, dresses and skirts. 
As for what's polite/impolite, I think general courtesy is universal and I wouldn't overthink it. As long as you're kind and polite, people are pretty understanding if you make a blunder, especially if you're foreign or grew up abroad.
Like number1journeyfan says, taxi drivers sometimes try to rip you off by not turning on the meter and by trying to negotiate the fare. Taxis are the main way to get around but expect some struggles over fares, traffic etc., they can be a pain.

&gt; Dua Lipa was born in London on 22 August 1995. Her first name ""Dua"" is an Albanian word which means ""love"" or ""want"". Her parents, who are ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, had left Prishtina in the 1990s. Among the schools she attended was the Sylvia Young Theatre School. She moved with her family to Kosovo in 2008, the year the country declared its independence from Serbia. At the age of 15, she moved back to London and lived with friends, because she wanted to build a career in music. She began working as a model at age 16. Lipa grew up listening to her father, the Kosovan rock singer Dukagjin Lipa, sing. At the age of 14 she began posting covers of her favourite songs by artists such as Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado on YouTube.

&gt; In 2015 Dua Lipa began working on her debut album for Warner Bros. Records. In August 2015 she released her first single ""New Love"", produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt. She released her second single ""Be the One,"" written by Lucy ""Pawws"" Taylor, in October 2015. Dua Lipa has said that ""Be the One is the only song on my album I haven't written ... [but] I couldn't not take it, it's my favourite thing"". Dua Lipa describes her musical style as ""dark pop"". On 30 November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts on the ""BBC Sound of...2016"" long list. Her first tour in the UK and Europe began in January 2016. Her debut album is scheduled for release in 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

So total mileage covered before the first breakdown was about 15 feet - from the crate to the front of the workshop. Way to go, AMF. Sat around drinking Fred's coffee and talking bike shit while they swapped out the starter. Eventually got out of the shop late afternoon. Rode the thing all over Europe, had it for years. It caught fire again in Le Mans France when the badly routed pos cable from the batt to the solenoid chafed through on some tinware. Got rescued by some french bikers who had a decent home shop nearby. Sorted the wiring, stayed for a week and got comprehensively laid by a cute french chick who preferred business to be conducted doggy style, which was fine by me.

1) The FTSE is at an all-time high in GBP; if you peg it in USD, it's actually down YTD and is in line with the broader performance of the European markets (using Stoxx 50 as a comparison). Don't believe me? Here:

https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSEARCA%3AEWU&amp;ei=tYoZWOCsOtrEjAGluK24DA

This isn't the FTSE 100, but rather a USD-denominated ETF that tries to track the UK market. It's down 5.5% YTD (excluding expense ratio). There's no FTSE100 ETF in USD as far as I know, but you can discount it  using the current exchange rate relative to the beginning of the year and you'll see for yourself that the FTSE is down in real terms around 6% or so.

2) Again, you realize that they're still in the EU, right? Nothing has fundamentally changed since the June vote. Trade deals are still in place. Immigration within the EU is still unrestricted. Yes, the doom and gloom about an imminent recession was excessive, but they were well-founded; this has nothing to do with partisan politics...investors and markets don't like surprises, and therefore economists rightly and fairly warned that a confidence shock may result in a recession. This didn't happen, but imagine if it did...people would be saying ""well, why didn't those eggheads warn us?"". The BOE itself said the immediate damage was less severe than it thought it would be, but that's because they expected a confidence shock in the market which never happened (similar to what happened after the US credit downgrade when people actually bought MORE US treasuries). The consensus among economists (that signed all those Remain letters) is that, long term, the British economy is worse off outside of the EU than in. 

Similarly, if Trump wins, I don't expect armageddon in January, or even in his first year...I just believe that his policies are bad. These economists looked at his plan (and based on them), they say they would be BAD for the country. I'm sure if he wins, we'll be reminded every week after November 8th that the economy hasn't collapsed yet and it's all thanks to President Trump (even if he actually assumes office well after November 8th).",False,0,politics,,3,snapchill,,t5_2cneq

The FTSE is high because the £ tanked, its value is dollars is nowhere near, and is secondarily inflated because the profits of these businesses are driven by overseas revenues in large part (short term help from currency)

Characterising a sharp uptick in inflation as 'moving toward target' is - again - hilarious. It is now on an upward trajectory, you are allowed to get smug about it once it's settled, not at the beginning.

You agree *now* it's too early to tell? A little different from you comment 5 minutes ago though?

The economic impact will take years to unfold, the scale of the effect is still very intimidating because the exact nature of exit is still up in the air. The issue isn't unemployment in 2017, or GBP rate, or exports. The issue is a slow and steady slide of businesses - especially the financial sector - over the next decade. As a net importer we are always going to have a worse time with a devalued currency.

That is the trademark that Bethesda filed in Europe for Fallout 4.  I'll quote you the relevant section in the link:

&gt;Pre-recorded DVDs featuring fantasy games; computer games, motion picture films, television programmes, ongoing television programmes, video tapes, pre-recorded DVDs, laser disks and other devices for accessing, downloading, transmitting, sharing, recording and playing such computer games, motion picture films and television programmes about a post-nuclear apocalyptic world; pre-recorded CDs, audio cassettes, video tapes, laser discs, DVDs and any other audio or audio-visual format used to download, transmit, share, store or deliver musical sound recording solely as feature in or otherwise associated with computer games, motion picture films, television programmes or ongoing television programmes, or series or collections of television programmes about a post-nuclear apocalyptic world. 

There is something missing from that, Cartridges!  If they included cartridges in the trademark, then it would be a likely case that they included it to cover their basis, but there isn't such a item in the specific trademark.

Now if we compare it to Skyrim's trademark from 2010:

&gt;Computer game software for use with computers and video game consoles; downloadable computer game software offered via the internet and wireless devices; Computer game software for use with on-line interactive games; Motion pictures

While Cartridges are not listed in the original trademark, you have to keep in mind that the trademark was filed long before the Switch was in development (long before Nintendo announced the merger of their console and handheld divisions in fact.)

Politics is all about opinions.

However, because of a separate law that was passed earlier, the decision was eligible for a referendum, if enough people asked for it. A campaign, led by a popular blogging site and some political groups, collected over 400,000 signatures to force a referendum to be held.

This referendum was quite controversial, as many people felt that the populace was not informed enough on the issue to have a say in it. The referendum would only be valid if it had a voter turnout over 30% and polls seemed to indicate that this threshold might not be reached. This split the people who supported the treaty into two camps: those who wanted to vote in favor of it, and those who wanted to boycott the referendum, arguing that it was a big waste of money.

In the end the referendum got a voter turnout of 32%, which meant the results would be valid. Because many proponents of the treaty boycotted the referendum, the opponents won by a very large margin.

This single [Brent Budowsky email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39975#efmALeAOf) sums it up from a local perspective:

*""I do not believe HRC will ultimately be elected by making comments in Iowa about income inequality while repeated stories flood the media that make her look like the crony-capitalist in chief""*

**Trump distinguishes himself from this.** Yes, he did participate in the capitalist system and profited from it as he was supposed to.  However, he didn't set up the system, and was not paid-off to change it by vested interests as too many US Senators are.

&gt; Can someone explain the appeal of this guy? For the love of cheese, explain to me what I am missing.

I cannot vote in the US election.  I live in Australia and originally from Europe.  I have visited the USA several times including: Florida, New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, and Houston. Maybe I can give you my personal 'outsiders' perspective. I'd prefer you have Bernie Sanders as president.  I would not vote for Hillary.

* 1. Trump will win because:

There's an old phrase ""You don't win government - you lose it."" I think that there is so much negativity from Hillary and Republicans about what Obama tried to achieve (e.g. Obamacare) that serves only to undermine Obama's legacy. 

Obama was about making the American people 'rise up'.  I remember his slogans about ""bottom up"" governance.  It resonated.  I believed it.  Now ... nobody in their right mind believes it.

* 2. To some of your points - which in my view do not 'separate the candidates' as much as you think they do.

&gt; His narcissism overrides his reason and I can't imagine that he would somehow stay within the confines of the law more than Hillary.

Yes, he is a narcissist. Many people who put themselves into the public arena are narcissists.  Bill Clinton was a narcissist. Barack is, and most likely Hillary too.  So stating 'don't vote for a narcissist' doesn't hold water in my view.

&gt; he quite openly shows disdain for the law.

Once again, so does Hillary.  Deleting emails being a case in point. 

&gt; I think people conflate being an asshole with not being politically correct.

Many politically correct people are assholes too.  Just two days ago there was a blog complaning about a large black penis being shown on Westworld Episode 5.  Did any black men complain about this objectification?  No a white woman took up that important cause on their behalf.

&gt; Do they want to have a President who bullies everyone and tries to uphold power by brute force? 

Again, this applies to both Clinton and Trump.  Clinton's bullying is apparent in the emails and in the Primaries. Bullying the Chair of the DNC.  Bullying Bernie and his supporters..  I used to love reading /r/SandersforPresident.

&gt; Political Correctness

I think some of the political correctness is driven by the entitled elite in your country.  It is done in order to make the people fight amongst each other.  Lets face it - if I'm born into a rich family I'm going to have a much better chance of making it in the USA.  If I'm the son of an actor - I'm going to have a much better chance of making it in Hollywood (not matter how tawdry and boring my life is).

The USA was built on the ""American Dream"" anyone could make it. The game is rigged by those in power, swapping money, jobs and inside information between each other.  The Clinton email leaks show that dynamic clearly.  Examples: People are put on display with Clinton merely because of their ethnicity or gender, Podesta divides Vice Presidential candidates into 'food groups' of - business, women, ethnicity, etc...  It just goes to show that the political correctness is a big show for Podesta.  It plays to people's emotions.

I think there will be more fall out from this. People will realise their emotions are being played upon.  The new culture of *'bullying from persecution'* evident in many parts of reddit on all sides of political spectrum has to stop. 

* 3. Do they want to see the nation crumble? 

They want to see a **power structure crumble**.  You are part of your nation, so is everyone in it.  Your nation will not crumble, because it will always exist.  Thr power structure problen is one thing that separates the core of the supporter bases that you have not picked up on in your Original Post.

Around the World people are getting pisssed off by being ruled by faceless beaurocrats and bribery.  Recent examples:

  (i) FIFA Soccer World Cup going to Qatar 

  (ii) Brexit

  (iii) South Korean (not North Korean) President being outed as a crony for 8 ruling families just last week.


* 4. Bernie Supporters

**Many Hillary commenters on reddit don't understand why Bernie supporters have every right and justification to vote for Trump**.  Hillary even made fun of Bernie's Democratic credentials at one point.  A lot of the talk in /r/SandersforPresident was about a system being rigged against them.  Its clear it was.  Influence was bought and paid for.  The emails, transcripts of talks to Big Banks, money flows, payments to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments for US policy influence ... all shows a larger system of corruption, with Clinton's name stamped right at the top of the letterhead.

* 5. Final Thought

It's time the people of the USA stopped fighting each other.  All these ""ISMs"" you've made up and been taught to believe in.  Activism in the USA ... mainly serves to polarise debate.  We're all just people.  You can bully people by pretending to be a victim. If the people of the USA worked together, rather than pointing out and labelling themselves with their differences all the time, then your nation would be great again.

Example of endemic labelling:  The term ""African American"" does not exist in the rest of the World.  If you're a black person in the UK, you are just called British.  In fact to call someone from the Caribbean ""African"" would be an insult, because in the UK black people directly from Africa and the Carribean live and work together alongside 'cis white people', and indians, and jews, and muslims, and sikhs.",False,0,changemyview,1∆,18,tenminuteslate, points,t5_2w2s8

9 times out of 10, you're going to fly into Tokyo. That's where you're likely to get the best flight price. If you're coming from another Asian country, it's possible to get cheap flights into Osaka — but anyone coming from North America or Europe will find much better flight prices when flying into Narita or Haneda.

Go with the cheapest option, and use the money you save for lodging, souvenirs, etc.

With a JR pass, going from Tokyo &gt; Osaka &gt; Kyoto &gt; Tokyo is doable and easy. You can go from Kyoto all the way back to Narita airport in about 3.5 hours.

&gt; also want to visit Tokyo for the wow factor and also the Ghibli Museum

If your entire reasoning in visiting Tokyo is the Ghibli Museum, you might be really disappointed. It's not that great. I don't know why tourists think it's going to be this spectacular thing — but it's not so much a ""museum"" as it is ""a small Ghibli themed building with attractions for children."" There's a short movie, a little Disneyland-eqsue recreation of a cottage and a Catbus only children can play on. That's it. You can find the same Ghibli merch in and around Tokyo, especially at the Ghibli shop in Tokyo Station.

The modern leftist ideology is something most intelligent people outgrow in their teenage years. Something that anyone who has experienced different cultures or paid income tax should abandon due to their informed and rational reasoning.

2. A lot of people speak English

3. Zero safety concerns, not even pickpocketing or tourist scammers.  Jordan is super safe. Safer than the US that's for sure and on the same level of security (if not better) than all the major European cities. Totally normal walking through the darkest streets after midnight. To be honest though, you might be disturbed with male-stares and sometimes, cat calls, but no one will touch you.

4. Yes, check this out when you're here: http://www.jordansun.com/events/calendar/today/

5. Read the wiki

6. No

7. You can wear whatever you want, but the more flesh you show the more stares you'd get (depending on where you are). As a rule of thumb, keep minimum wearing to knee-long shorts or skirts and normal t-shirts or tank tops. But if you're coming around this time it'd be very cold so you'd be wearing somewhat conservatively anyway.

8. If you're offered food, don't reject it. Fake being super full and that you've just eaten but don't say a cold ""no thanks"" especially to family moms and aunts. Also I don't know your family's background but generally you don't hug the males unless they're like first cousins or something. Other than that just be normal. 

9. Jordanians in the street might be curious to meet you and some might introduce themselves. Make some friends! also if you felt unsafe in any situation just call 911, the number is the same as in the US. Other than that just stop stressing out, read about Jordan on wikitravel or watch YouTube videos to see where you're going to, and enjoy your time when you're here!!",False,0,jordan,,10,ploidZero,,t5_2qkq7

for international travel, you can take ship from Tallinn to closer countries (Finland, Sweden, Russia), or catch a flight from Tallinn or Riga (you should definitely consider going to Riga for flights, 5€ for one way bus and airBaltic's hub is there). speaking of buses those go all the way to Berlin, so also a possible budget travel option. maybe in the time you're here railbaltic will also be finished which means train access to central Europe.

it's certainly a safe city by American standards/whatnot. unless you are actively seeking for trouble and approaching aggressive people, you will be just fine. you can probably walk to most places around town, but there is fairly good public transport systems. bikes are certainly not uncommon in the warmer seasons, don't know about bike roads in Tartu though.

activities - well, there's a lot of cultural things and museums to see, Vanemuine is a highly regarded theatre. concerts tend to be in Tallinn but it's about a 2 hour bus drive away so definitely not an impossible route. start taking vitamin D in october to avoid seasonal affective disorder (winter depression). no idea about your interests but one scene that is bigger in Tartu than Tallinn is tabletop and other RPGs.

restaurants in Tartu are a thing and there are certainly good ones, but I don't know much about them. supermarkets are well stocked though I guess different national kitchens are a bit lacking, and things like watermelons or strawberries aren't available year-round - or if they are they just kinda suck and no one buys them. vegan food is becoming relatively common recently though you will be somewhat limited, I guess.",False,0,Eesti,Tallinn,9,r1243,flag ee,t5_2rffn

Well, speaking from personal experience, I would say I'm doing pretty well to assimilate into most Western ideals but, it is true, there is one contemporary ideal I just don't get. This idea that every western country is inherently like the US - immigrant country with no base culture that should be a melting pot and/or a mosaic. To me that's completely ridiculous since it seems obvious that Germany is the land of Germans and of German culture or France is the land of the French culture and so on. The native cultures should be embraced and enforced and immigrants should be expected to assimilate to much higher degree than in the US because European countries are not immigrant countries. 

Otherwise we'll just go in circles over the same arguments that have been made million times since the migrant crisis started. 

My problem with MENA immigrants especially is that there are too many of them and the ones that are already in the west don't assimilate and bringing in millions more won't help that. 

Islam in theory is the same as Christianity but in practice it is a political force mostly comparable to 19th century Catholicism when it had quite a lot of clout and staunchly supported conservatives and conservative parties.

&gt;would like a suggestion about the case

I favor compact ATX cases like the NZXT S340, Corsair Carbide 400 (Q or C) or Phanteks P400. They are fairly small for ATX cases and have a great interal layour for airflow and cable management. If in doubt and the money is tight cases from Fractal Design are always a solid baseline.


&gt;do i actually need the cpu cooler or am i fine with the stock one?

Only the non-K CPUs have a stock cooler. I would always get a decent custom cooler, but the stock cooler is fine as a backup until you have the money for a better cooler.


&gt;last thing, i'd prefer not to adjust the ram speed, hence why i chose the 2400 ones. Are they fine?

For you the cheapest RAM will do. Just get a 16GB dual-channel kit.




Here's what [I did with your build](http://it.pcpartpicker.com/list/7HQkwV). Saved a lot on the CPU and the mainboard without sacrificing crucial features (or performance), added an SSD for a massive perfomance boost in windows, added a GTX 1070 for a massive performance boost in games (especially in higher resolutions), replaced the HDD and the PSU, added a case and dropped the CPU cooler (but get a decent custom air cooler once you have the money). Came in slightly above your budget. Drop the DVD-drive and it will fit (do you really still need an ODD?).

**EDIT: Updated the case in the list!**

The case isn't much, but it is enough for a start and you can replace it at a later point. Could have even saved some money on the mainboard, but I thought that you might like the all-black look with these components.

P.S.: Either Italy is a barren wasteland when it comes to PC components or PCPartPicker is lying hard about the availability of PC components in your country. If you can order from the EU, e.g. Germany, you would have a lot more components to chose from (but I assume that PCPartPicker just doesn't cover Italy very well).

BTW - I added this part much later from the original, so it has nothing to do with the upvotes. Just so you know.


&gt; Because Israeli lobbying has a huge power grip on pretty much every western ""democracy"". This isn't conspiracy, by the way, it's well known and accepted. Israeli supporters provide a lot of funding to people campaigning for democratically elected positions, and thus have a huge influence on how those governments operate.


You see, this is the sort of shit I am actually against (and yes, it is a conspiracy, because it is not widely accepted and there literally is no proof). A small nation like Israel cannot possibly have a ""power-grip"" on bigger nations. Even the lobbying group AIPAC's power is over-exaggerated in the US. America supports Israel because a majority of its population supports Israel, not because Jews own politicians. This is the sort of anti-semitism that greatly worries me. What's even more scary is that the comment above was quickly replied with this one.


&gt; **And they wonder why Israel is so hated around the world. It's because of their sneaky rat like tendencies manipulating other countries government for their own gain. Has been going on for centuries**


You see how this guy didn't even bother to hide it? It looks like propaganda straight out of Nazi Germany. Israel has not been around for centuries. He just replaced the word ""Jew"" with ""Israel"" and actually thought the end result would be acceptable. He's not criticizing the state, he's accusing Jews of being rats.

The disband itself is bad for the pro-scene. While I can see the team not improving soon and some change could to be done is hard to swallow a full disband.

Now we only have MVP Black as the only Korean team that has endured HotS pro-scene during 2016. Their only roster change came from a player request. Props to their staff and players for the resilience.

While I'm glad and grateful we kind of need a team that could challenge them. They are the ""perfect villain"" that destroy hopes and crushes dreams and then the heroic team comes and defeat them at the end; but seems that it becomes harder and harder to find that team that could face them.

&gt;And, how does ranked system work in this game? 

You can play Hero League as soon as you have 14 available heroes that are at least level 5, which includes the current Free-to-Play heroes, that change every week. You will play 10 placement matches, after which you will be sent to a league and division, with Masters being the highest one (actually Grand Master, but the top Masters are classified as Grand Masters). There is no MMR shown, though [Hotslogs](http://hotslogs.com/) (which you should use to upload your games) also uses a league system, though that only puts people in their own ""leagues"" based on their MMR.

We are in Season 2 now. For more info, see [here.](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20111014/ranked-play-revamp-5-6-2016)

If you don't feel like playing ranked first, despite having 14+ heroes, you can play Unranked, which also works with draft (and allows more than duo q). Keep in mind that there is a hidden MMR system in Unranked and Quick Match. The Unranked MMR will affect your starting Hero League MMR, be aware of this.

And if you don't want to solo or duo q ranked matches for Hero League, you can pair up with 4 people and play Team League.

&gt;How does the pick phase look like? 

The team that wins the coin toss will start the draft. This is how the draft order works (assume the Blue team starts the draft):

* First Ban phase: Blue team bans one hero first, then Red team bans one hero
* First Pick phase: Blue picks one hero, Red picks two heroes, Blue picks two heroes
* Second Ban phase: Red bans one hero, Blue bans one hero
* Second Pick phase: Red picks two heroes, Blue Picks two heroes, Red picks one hero


I think I rarely meet toxic players and when I meet them, I mute them. You can also afterwards report players for insulting language and what not, and after several reports from different players they'll automatically get silenced. Silenced players cannot play in Hero League.

&gt;Whats a good site for learning build paths for different champs?

&gt;Any other tips for new player much appreciated &lt;3

* [Get yourself recruited by someone](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/game/recruit-a-friend/) to receive an xp and gold bonus and two heroes for free. You have to do this **before you reach level 6**, otherwise the opportunity is gone.
* [Read this](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/heroes/487437-transitioning-into-the-nexus) (or [this](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/heroes/486869-welcome-to-the-nexus-a-basic-guide-to-heroes-of-the-storm), depending on your experience in MOBAs), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3esvyx/competitive_hots_guide_by_41kmmr_player/). Some basic guides. Also play the tutorial if you are a beginner or the Veteran challenge if you are more experienced. Maybe you can learn a thing or two from this and you will also be rewarded with overall 1000 gold.
* [How to throw your games.](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3z6qv3/all_the_places_youll_go_all_the_ways_that_youll/) (Please don't throw your games.)
* Mount up often. Saves you lots of time.
* Don't forget to use your Hearthstone and don't go to an objective with zero mana if you play a hero with mana. Right before an objective, I prefer to hearth than to tap the healing fountain if I have the time. Learning the timing of objectives and mercenaries can improve your games a lot.
* Soaking xp is what many people get wrong at first. This is a PvP game, but you can't let all lanes unattended. Losing free xp to your towers without anyone standing nearby can cost you the game. Like the guide above says, a minion wave at the start of the game is worth more xp than a kill in pure xp numbers (map presence and them not being able to soak not included). The opposite is also the case though. Don't stay too long in a lane and kill every minion for the xp, your team might need help with an objective or a fight.
* Map objectives are important but only *help* win the game (except for Towers of Doom, since the objective is doing most of the damage). End goal is still to destroy the enemy's Core.
* It's mentioned in the guides already, but I'll say it again. Laning phase works vastly differently than in other MOBAs. Last hitting isn't necessary for the majority of the characters. If you are losing in a lane, retreat to your towers. If you keep losing, ask for help (pinging should be used often) or to change lanes with someone that can deal better with that enemy hero than you. It's okay to let the towers kill the minions. Staying alive and soaking xp is what counts.
* Watchtower on Sky Temple and Blackheart's Bay is overvalued, you can achieve more at the beginning of the game by soaking xp on all lanes than to constantly engage into team fights. The race to level 10 (and thus unlocking heroics) is real and important!
* Although split-push strategies exist too, grouping up as five is most of the time better than as a group of two or three. Especially after level 10. Don't run alone to objectives, wait for your teammates or risk getting murdered.
* You're at quite a big disadvantage, if the enemy team has a talent advantage (level advantages without talent advantages are usually not that bad). Don't engage if they are level 10 and you are not. You *will* get crushed.
* [Body blocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxc38jYYy5M) is real. Make use of it. It can be the difference between letting someone escape and securing a kill.
* Learn as many heroes as possible, play each at least to level 5 to receive 500 gold. Try a hero out first before you buy him/her. Use the F2P rotation for that. Also check the [Weekly Sale](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/forum/topic/13605640947?page=1) thread where price reductions and sales are announced.
* For more tips, /r/NexusNewbies is a good place.

&gt; Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&amp;B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.

&gt; Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike ""The Man"" Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as ""The Man"" was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably ""We Care a Lot"", which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and ""We Are the World"".

&gt; The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of ""creative differences."" In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band's internal relationships had descended into ""pathological hatred"". Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the ""whipping boy"" of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.

&gt; Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group's first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

&gt; Patton's astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling—usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on ""Epic"" and the sleazy jazz vocals of ""Edge Of the World"" (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as ""a pair of lungs on legs.""

&gt; The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as ""not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic."" The video for ""Epic"", which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1).

&gt; Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is ""one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,"" and another writes that ""'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers … reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.""  Angel Dust featured the singles ""Midlife Crisis"" and ""A Small Victory"", as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic ""Easy"", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U.S., sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of ""Easy"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U.K., South America, Europe and Australia.

&gt; After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N' Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band's most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U.K., Germany and Australia. In the U.S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1.5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles ""Gentle Art Of Making Enemies"" and ""Take This Bottle"", and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of ""King For A Day."" It's been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived...Patton doesn't drive any more. Patton comments, ""Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. ...We had to look at lot of things in the face...it was nice.""

&gt; 
Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U.S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Last Cup Of Sorrow"" had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad ""Stripsearch"" was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). ""She Loves Me Not"" was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up.

&gt; On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band's growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide.

&gt; Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantômas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996).

&gt; Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks ""Falling To Pieces"" and ""The Perfect Crime"" were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey respectively.

&gt; On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009.  The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press  release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM.com. 

&gt; Th 10-song album Sol Invictus was released May 19, 2015. Read more on Last.fm.

Within the EU, crossing borders comes from the Schengen agreements and related law, which do not apply to either the UK or Ireland, which have a separate common travel area. Free movement of people is part of the single market and relates primarily to the right of people to work anywhere in the EU and not be discriminated against.

There is nothing to stop the UK, post-Brexit, from continuing to allow people from Ireland to travel to the UK without showing a passport. This is what the UK wants and what Ireland wants and the UK government has been clear about it.

I'll jump in here again if that's okay. I switched to the Europe one but realized it's totally wasted on me, I never go on loseit at 10 pm my time... So I just end up writing in it the next day anyway. :)

Also I don't think I have *that much* to say so less visibility for my blabbering in here is a good thing lol.

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm working on this month:

* Yoga every day (focus on stronger arms/upper body, every day getting closer to being able to do crow pose and headstands)

* 2 L water every day

* Weekly calorie goals (10500/week for me, 11900 for hubby)

&amp;nbsp;

Since I started maintaining, my husband sort of did too... lol. Now I want to go on date nights where we end up eating too much, and he doesn't workout as much as I do, so we've both basically been maintaining.

He's supposed to be around 104 kg in December but he's been stuck on 111.

So from this week we're trying out weekly goals. I've been opposed to them in the past, I don't like 'punishing' yourself/making up for mistakes, but they might work for us now. Basically the 'rules' are that if you go over your weekly calorie goal, the surplus gets deducted from next week (within reason). We also aim to be physically active 7 days a week.

So we re-implemented the fridge list. Now with a totals column at the bottom. (We write down calories, exercise and weight.)

&amp;nbsp;

Yoga: We stepped it up a notch and went from advanced kundalini classes to hatha vinyasa + adv. kundalini.

Hatha vinyasa is pretty tough - the teacher loves it when people transition to it, because that class has the least amount of participants... :) We tried it out and it was really hard work but I liked it.

I always work on the things I have trouble doing in class. So now I have a bunch of things to work on... Today I practiced

* Putting my forearms and head on the ground (close to a wall)... Walking up to my head as far as I can until my back is against the wall... Trying to lift my feet up. (I can't yet.)

* Alternating downward facing dog / planks - on my forearms. To get stronger so I can eventually stand on my forearms with my feet up.

* Shoulder stands with my eyes closed. Because I had trouble closing my eyes while doing them in class...

* Crow pose (worked on it all October, still not much progress).

It is of course the case that for a long time there were indeed blasphemy laws in western europe. And Life of Brian was specifically banned in the UK and only unbanned in the mid 80's.

Primarily it was the liberals of western-european society that pushed for the weakening and overturning of blasphemy laws, with more-or-less complete success. Not a bad thing in my opinion. 

But a new major, highly conservative and illiberal, religious group has arrived and now we are pushing for the de facto re-implementation of blasphemy laws to suit the desires of this group, while simultaneously still holding that our native formerly-dominant religion should not be so protected.

However, if you're only wanting to do options on VIX, there's a few things to keep in mind:

1. VIX options track /VX futures, not the spot VIX price
2. There are multiple /VX futures with different expiration dates and different prices. You need to understand which future is linked to your option if you want to fully understand the pricing and profit potential
3. VIX options expire at different times than other options and are European exercise. The settlement price is also calculated on market open, and the last time to trade it is the day before expiration (or something like that). Since this is very confusing, you should sell for a profit before expiration.
4. I suggest limiting your risk and profits by doing a vertical spread, but that requires more research to make sure you know what you're doing.

Right now VIX is @ 18.79. Let's say you buy the NOV 19 CALL @ 1.75. This option is for /VXX6 which is @ 17.80.

If you get a good upward move in the corresponding VIX future, your call will obviously be worth more than you paid for it.

t3_5ajhlk,1478089726,1481146831,d9i8svd,False,0,,t3_5ajhlk,"Ultimately, the idea *probably* derives from images of human sacrifice in the Bible, such as the Binding of Isaac, as in [Genesis 22: 9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22):

&gt; 9 When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

These in turn were based on widespread practices of animal sacrifice in the ancient Near East and around the Mediterranean. Human sacrifice was an historical practice, but like cannibalism it was more widely used as a polemic to denounce other religions - there's a large body of work on that, you might start with [Human sacrifice--in history and today](http://www.worldcat.org/title/human-sacrifice-in-history-and-today/oclc/6735457) if you want to delve into the accounts, but let's unpack a couple of the specifics of your question:

&gt; virgin

The adoration of virginity goes back a long way; many tales of the founding of Athens involve virgin sacrifices, and find their way into the Greek tragedies. Rome hosted some of the most famous in antiquity being the Vestal Virgins, who could be subject to death if they were unchaste, which happened at least a couple times in history; you can read about some of that in the old essay [Human Sacrifices at Rome](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/JRS/2/Human_Sacrifices_at_Rome*.html) The cultural significance and meaning of virginity varies throughout different societies and times, so it's hard to make a really definitive statement except that especially as Christianity began to take hold in Europe and the cult of the Virgin Mary gained prominence, virginity became associated with ""purity"" or ""innocence."" This idea was reinforced by the re-discovery and spread of Greek plays during the Renaissance, where works like [Heracleidae](http://classics.mit.edu/Euripides/heracleidae.html) by Euripedes include lines like:

&gt; All those who chant prophetic words have I assembled, and have examined ancient oracles, both public and secret, as means to save this city. And though the several answers differ in many points, yet in one is the sentiment of all clearly the same; they bid me sacrifice to Demeter's daughter some maiden from a noble father sprung.

This leads us to the next bit:

&gt; Was this around in medieval Europe during the witch hunts in Germany and the Netherlands?

For all that there was a special attribute of innocence attached to ""virgins"" which made them of extra value for sacrifice, if you look at accounts of the witch-trials most of the human sacrifices involve infants and children, especially those that are unbaptized. In Montague Summers' translation of the [Malleus Maleficarum](http://www.worldcat.org/title/malleus-maleficarum-of-heinrich-kramer-and-james-sprenger/oclc/246623) for instance includes (143):

&gt; [...] when a witch offers a child to the devil, she commends it body and soul to him as its beginning and its end in eternal damnation; wherefore not without some miracle can the child be set free from the payment of so great a debt.

The *Malleus Maleficarum* (1486) was issued after a lot of the individual elements of the popular idea of witchcraft had congealed - the pact with the devil, the witches' familiar, night flights, sabbats, etc. - and the idea of witchcraft and heresy were intertwined, so you have accounts which are positively theistic, such as (197):

&gt; [...] They savour of heresy in this way, that they utter nefarious prayers and offer sacrifices at the altars of idols, and they consult with devils and receive answers from them [...]

At this point, I think we've established that the idea of virgin sacrifice originated in antiquity, that idea of human sacrifice on an altar was continually available for propagation through the Bible, and that the medieval conception of witches were as heretics that literally worshiped Satan, sometimes with human sacrifice.Which leads into the next bit:

&gt; satanic ritual

The most famous Satanic ritual is the Black Mass, a perversion (or if you prefer, inversion) of the Catholic formula incorporating a number of blasphemies; while there were many heretical versions of the Mass in history, the Black Mass as we know it today largely descends from the novel [Là-Bas](http://www.worldcat.org/title/down-there-la-bas/oclc/1146108) (1891) by Joris-Karl Huysmans, which includes a description of the ""altar:""

&gt; On a table serving as tabernacle a woman lay down, naked or with her skirts lifted up over her head, and with her arms outstretched. She held the altar lights during the whole office.

&gt; Guibourg thus celebrated masses on the abdomen of Mme. de Montespan, of Mme. d'Argenson, of Mme. de Saint-Pont. As a matter of fact these masses were very frequent under the Grand Monarch. Numbers of women went to them as in out rimes women flock to have their fortunes told with cards.

&gt; ""The ritual of these ceremonies was sufficiently atrocious. Generally a child was kidnapped and burnt in a furnace out in the country somewhere, the ashes were saved and mixed with the blood of another child whose throat had been cut, and of this mixture a paste was made resembling that of the Manicheans of which I was speaking. Abbe Guibourge officiated, consecrated the host, cut it into little pieces and mixed it with this mixture of blood and ashes. That was the material of the Sacrament.""

The murder of the children is descended fairly directly from the kind of accounts obtained in the witch-hunts, and Huysmans' Black Mass gives the image of the bound victim on the altar from antiquity, but it doesn't quite put them together. The real popularization of the archetype of the virgin-on-the-altar occurred later, and it's fairly clear that by the 1920s and 30s it was beginning to gel. For example Julian Franklyn in [A Survey of the Occult](http://www.worldcat.org/title/survey-of-the-occult/oclc/648371829) (1935) states:

&gt; The first requirement in the celebration of the Black Mass is a virgin, naked, spread-eagled on the 'altar' and the climax is reached when the officiating priest performs the sexual act with her.

It's not explicit where Franklyn gets that idea from, but it seems to be a combination of Huysman's Black Mass and possibly sex magick rituals as practiced by Aleister Crowley (Crowley never performed a Black Mass, but he had a ritual known as the Gnostic Mass which shared a few similarities).

Pulp fiction also had the idea pretty firmly in the 1920s and 30s, although it wasn't uniquely associated with Satanism, but with ""heathen"" or magical practices in general - something of a holdover from Colonialism vilifying aspects of native religious. In Robert E. Howard's ""The Hour of the Dragon"" (serialized 1935-1936) for example, there is a scene:

&gt; Xaltotun stood beside the dark altarstone and stared across the valley, at the dead and wounded men on the terraces, at the grim, blood-stained band at the head of the slopes, at the dusty, steel-clad ranks reforming in the vale below. He glanced up at the sky, and he glanced down at the slim white figure on the dark stone. And lifting a dagger inlaid with archaic hieroglyphs, he intoned an immemorial invocation:

&gt; ""Set, god of darkness, scaly lord of the shadows, by the blood of a virgin and the sevenfold symbol I call to your sons below the black earth! Children of the deeps, below the red earth, under the black earth, awaken and shake your awful manes! Let the hills rock and the stones topple upon my enemies! Let the sky grow dark above them, the earth unstable beneath their feet! Let a wind from the deep black earth curl up beneath their feet, and blacken and shrivel them—""

&gt; He halted short, dagger lifted. In the tense silence the roar of the hosts rose beneath him, borne on the wind.

The pulps allowed this kind of flexibility, where the old image of virgin sacrifice on altars to strange gods could be transported to different times and contexts. From a literary standpoint, virginity also allows for a certain amount of sexual tension in a scene, which may be why the idea of the ""virgin sacrifice"" gained popularity both as a literary trope and as a visual element for sex appeal in horror films as they grew more explicit in the 1970s and 80s. The loose Lovecraft adaptation of ""The Dunwich Horror"" (1970) and the Hammer Horror film ""To the Devil A Daughter"" (1976) really comes to mind for the specific imagery of ""splayed out on the altar.""

Carnivore's debut depicts a dystopian post-Nuclear world meets Conan the Barbarian. You get tongue in cheek numbers like ""Male Supremacy"", which takes the piss of overt machismo both through the writing and the sudden change of pace in the second half of the song. This is great album from start to finish and a fine example of how a release can be humorous without being forced.

**[Muro - Telon de Acero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7I4wecMyC0)** - Spanish HM doesn't get much love and it's obvious why to some extent. Very few of the bands in the scene tried to forge their own sound, instead opting to emulate their idols in other European countries. Muro is one such band, clearly taking strong influence from Accept and Judas Priest. Even with their obvious influences, Telon de Acero is a solid album that embodies everything that is good about 80s speed - fast, melodic guitars and frenetic drumming.

**[Ravensire - The Cycle Never Ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsd9uJryMh4)** - Epic heavy metal of the utmost quality. From the guys that brought you Ironsword, we have another fine tribute to the early gods of USPM. What is really striking about this release are the gruff vocals from Rick Thor. A lot of USPM singers opt for more melodic and softer vocalists, but Thor's vocal approach perfectly fits the atmosphere of the record. For epic metal fanatics.

**[John Carpenter - everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSLaYJboPE)** - What is there to say about this man?

As for Saudi Arabia well they are allies of US and Israel but there are tons of people who despise them in the USA and Europe.

&gt;The second point kind of ties back to the first point, which is that BDS at its heart does not seek to reform Israel, it seeks to destroy it. 

no it seeks to put pressure on Israelis to elect more liberal governments. I don't know why every Israeli feels everybody is out to destroy them. It's a bizarre mentality you guys have. As if no human being can ever object to the Israeli government without wishing for complete genocide. 

At it's core the BDS movement is about individuals taking action. Our governments are loyal to Israel to an unnatural degree and refuse to lift a finger to end the occupation. If they are not going to do anything we are. It's as simple as that.

* Trump will likely be the Huey Long of the 21st century. A populist whose opinions will be radicalized by future generations to imagine alternative scenarios where the US turns into an authoritarian oppressive dictatorship.

* If the European Project fails, the early 21st century will be seen as the rise of the far-right and a ""reactionary decade"" in Europe. If it endures, the early 21st century will be seen as a time of great turmoil and a battle between the ""righteous Europeanists"" and ""reactionary elements"".

* People will connect the Ukraine Crisis and the Arab Spring as directly caused by the Great Recession.

* The early 21st century will be seen as a series of complete chaos in the sectors of literature and art history. People will probably group all post-Internet literature and culture into a single arbitrary movement, much like what happened with Modernism in the early 20th century.

Some time ago french MOD said that purely rely on american intelligence on critical aspects of security policy. European countries has no word in NATO forces and hardly have common army. Europen countries were involved in some conflicts due to american interests. Typically, European countries pretends to have piece of cake for involvement in american deals. It would be very long to elaborate it there but Europe is losing its subjectivity and becoming object of american policy through that is why so much scepticism about future of EU.

&gt;Hardly. What was the US supposed to do in response to Turkey's covert support for ISIS? Start bombing shit in Turkey? I don't think you would like that.

They put sanctions on Iran and Russia for really nothing but resistance to american interests. They could raise this question and pressure EU to put trade sanctions on Turkey. Turkey is very sensitive to trade relationships with EU. Instead they havent made step in this direction and even confirmed Turkey provides no support to ISIS. This way they stimulated Turkey to continue. I make conclusion - it is in american interests.

&gt;Sure, the purpose of supporting rebels was to create terrorism and not overthrow the sociopathic and psychopathic Assad regime. Occam's razor, friend.

How jihadists and similar sectarian, radicals beheading entire villages by religious attributes and claiming to do the same with millions of others, could fix it? You are trying to justify bigger devil by fighting with smaller one. There is no perfect in democracy but choice between two bad things. Syria has no options. They could better stop provocating some social group so that regime could not able to justify repressions, they could help invest to education and healthcare to build bases for better political order. Now most of syrian population is behind regime for sure because none need these barbarians with their ideology to put country in the stone age.
And here is second thing. Who else should rule the country? Opposition sources use whatever justification to avoid elections. Even if they could pass under international supervision. Why? Becuase they know that they wont get signficant percent. Otherwise Assad is absolutely legit head of the country even if you think he is ""sociopathic and psychopathic"". It is your personal opinion and if people of Syria decides him to stay he should stay. But foreign sponsors care only about removal of him rather then about future without him. So much that even ready to finance terrorists to use them against Assad.

&gt;Brother, it's not the 19th century anymore. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are not going to go on wars of conquest in Europe. That would be a complete contradiction of any logical sense and reason.

Obviously, no. There are myriad precedents of orchestrated changes based on social manipulations. These changes were taken place in Europe as well. I.e. in Kosovo, in Ukraine.

Right.. So you have a professional civil service to ensure that there are people who have the skills to properly implement decisions, but surely an elected government should be setting the policy direction for the country?

Trump and Brexit, now, personally I think Trump would be a disaster for the US, but if people in the US want to go that way that surely has to be up to them, they get a say in how they are governed... The same goes for the UK leaving the EU, there is nothing problematic about that unless you suggest that people shouldn't even have a say in who legislates on their behalf.

I try to explain this to people verbally but people get lost in translation very quickly. I will say that latency does play a HUGE part especially with SBMM. I have a Netduma so I can see where the people I'm playing against are located. I am in Canada and half my lobby is located in EMEA or APAC. With Netduma I can also ping people. I have a 1GB FiberOptic connection wired directly into my house. People in North America ping anywhere for 7-35ms depending distance to me. People in South America ping between 50-100ms on average. UK and Western Europe ping around ~120ms. Players in Africa or west of Ukraine (Russia, Middle East, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc) ping at 250ms+. Given half the lobby are people in the higher ping areas my games are often REALLY laggy when I solo queue.

Now how does this impact you, the average reader? 

As an example...if someone living in the United States has a 50MB connection (standard Comcast/Verizon connection) and experiencing a 90ms ping (matching the best possible connection of a player in EMEA or APAC) they're experiencing a 2% packet loss on average which degrades your connection to 2.5Mbps which is below the suggested connection for Destiny of 5Mbps.

There were a number of European bands who appeared in the 1990's doing medieval music with a lot of rock or heavy metal influence.  I think it might have been started by the Germans: their own folk music was tainted so much after being appropriated by the Nazis that  there was a real impetus for going to very early sources and so there were a number of heavy metal medieval bands like Corvus Corax who did essentially heavy metal with electric bagpipes and medieval /renaissance tunes.  

There's very very little surviving Medieval dance music.  [Timothy MGee's collection of dances](http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=63443 i) is just one slim volume, and it covers hundreds of years. The Saltarello on the Vox Vulgaris site is one of those. There are a lot of songs, however, in collections like the Cantigas de Santa Maria, Libre Vermell, and from the Troubadors and Minnesangers.  The Cantigas lend themselves especially well to bagpipes - they're sometimes in odd meters, don't have a huge gamut, have catchy phrasing, and I see Vox Vulgaris did  few of them. I'm not sure where the melodies in the ""murderous medley"" YouTube clip came from specifically.  Maybe someone else will recognize them.

Because these pieces mostly survive as single melody lines ( though Vox Vulgaris also did Stella Splendens, which has two beautiful lines: compare it with [Jordi Savalls' more scholarly version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxO8Gse5os) )it's possible to take one and rock out on it: get a good rhythmic groove going with percussion and some guitar-like instrument.  A little of this is not unlikely- lots of pictures of medieval musicians show them holding percussion instruments and they liked a good solid beat as much as anyone, no doubt.  But we know that medieval notions of harmony are not modern ones, and the guitarist/citternist in this band is using very full I,ii, IV,V and VII  chords in progressions that are anything but medieval. And the pieces are structured in a very modern way (play the head twice, solo over chords, come back to head, blow, etc.) Since bagpipes have some of the same tonal qualities as electric guitar with distortion, the genres mix pretty well, though, which is why the music is fun.",False,0,AskHistorians,,5,Bodark43,,t5_2ssp3

You will be able to remove it through a series of national focuses, but it will make building up for the war a lot harder. Politically, South Africa was by no means a united country during the late 30ies. While it was a British Dominion, the memories of the Boer Wars are still alive, and historically, joining the war was a very narrow thing that cost the prime minister his job - Hertzog had campaigned to keep South Africa out of the war, while his party decided that they would stand with Britain. A strong pro-German opposition even carried out acts of sabotage inside the country. In the event of war, you will have to deal with them.

saf_dd1.jpg

Of course, if you wish to depart from history, you will have ways to do so. One of our design goals in this expansion was to give more alternatives to playing a country, while also faithfully representing the historical outcomes. Another goal was to open up new areas of the map to warfare, which were fairly untouched in the historical timeline. If you know the location of every swamp province in eastern Europe by heart, perhaps the lands south of the Sahara will provide a new challenge.

In the fascist branch, you decide to side with the hardcore anti-British Afrikaner Broederbond and either try to use the opportunity of the war to roll back the loss of Boer colonies or decide to go with Germany (they won't ask for their colony back...for now), which will even allow you to join into a tech sharing arrangement with them. But seizing power will not be easy, and you must time your moves carefully. If you play your hand a little too late or a little too early, you will face the might of the British Empire without friends to help you. Once you are securely in power, however, you may even decide to crown a new King for your country (you may have to make do with a slightly used one for starters).

In the communist branch, you will first work to unmake the discrimination against your fellow black workers, before facing a difficult choice - you can decide to join the comintern and become a staunch ally of the Soviet Union in Africa. Soviet Advisers will help you improve your military, while a tech sharing arrangement helps you find the scientifically correct way to achieve victory. The alternative is called the anti-colonialist crusade: Having thrown off the shackles of your colonial masters, it is time to start decolonising the rest of the continent. For this purpose, we have added a number of African countries which you can liberate. Don't worry, you won't have to march into Lisbon to free Angola. If you control the state, you will get the option to free them even if you are still at war with Portugal. But of course, you may instead decide that these young nations need more firm guidance...

With South Africa's limited resources, you must make careful choices to navigate the war. Tech sharing can provide you with a powerful boost to your research speed - a boost you will lose the moment you decide to leave the Commonwealth. Britain will also be a source for more advanced military equipment that will not be available when you leave.

Like the other commonwealth nations we are fleshing out there are new portraits for leaders and generals too:

Continuous Focuses
With Together for Victory we introduce a new type of national focuses. These can only be taken if you have done at least 10 regular focuses first and rather than taking 70 days and giving you a rewards they instead give you different kinds of bonuses while they are active (this means you can turn them off if you are low on political power or need to do something else). The base system here will be part of the 1.3 Torch patch, while the focuses related to new mechanics in the expansion will only be available to people who get that.
saf_dd2.jpg 
Army Training - Speeds up training of divisions
Naval Production - Gives a general production boost to producing all kinds of ships
Air Production - Gives a general production boost to producing all kinds of aircraft and infrastructure (simulating locals helping out) and also increases the effect of ordered repairs substantially.
Resistance Suppression - Helps you suppress resistance in occupied states so you will need to tie up less of your fighting forces
Technology Sharing - Lets you gain a technology sharing effect (if you do not already have one) from faction members. Only members who actually use this focus will gain the benefits though.
Increase Autonomy - Will help you work towards more autonomy (details next diary!)
Suppress Subjects - Will help keep your subjects under control (details next diary!)
Construction Engineering - Speeds up construction of all non-industry buildings
Construction Repairs - Increases the amount of free repair that gets done to damaged buildings

Speaking of construction and repairs, we have changed costs of forts so that they now ramp up in cost with higher levels, and made base level cheaper so its now a major investment to try and build something like the maginot line which should make things less exploitable and more strategically interesting. The base free repair effect has also been reduced to make the Construction Repairs focus more interesting.

Next week we will be talking about the new Autonomy system hinted at through the so-far revealed focus trees. See you then!

In the meantime, check out this trailer to set the mood for our upcoming Commonwealth focused expansion: Together for Victory.

t1_d9i8muh,1478093390,1481147852,d9iav6o,False,0,,t3_5ad3bw,"&gt;what means that in a way, they're supporting it by helping them raise money from their customers.

You just don't understand the gun community, and you never will as a Swede. Larry Potterfield(Midway owner) is an NRA member himself. Many of his customers are NRA members, and most of his employees are probably NRA members. We as a gun community have a vested interest in the NRA. The NRA is not evil or shady, and your outside perspective really means nothing as its uneducated here. It is misinformed by media sources that have a vendetta against self-defense and gun ownership. 

&gt;I was making a general point, I'm not saying that the NRA is paid by evil pro-gun corporations who want to sell guns to children nor anything crazy like that. I'm just saying that they're exerting some influence.

The gun industry is part of the gun community, they have no influence over the market though. If they abandoned the NRA, most of the gun community even non NRA members would abandon them. You are just plain wrong about this issue, the industry is beholden to the NRA and its members, along with gun owners in general. The industry has very little influence, other that the training community.

&gt;I don't know but I think it makes sense he would have been able to kill more people if his guns had had more ammo each, than if he had had to reload every 10 shots.

Thats false though, and you don't even know what makes sense since you don't own or know anything about shooting guns. The worst massacre in the US before Orlanda was 32 people killed. He used a glock with 10 round magazines. The Columbine shooters had break action shotguns and 10 shot rifles. They also had an illegal machine gun but it surprisingly only kill just as many as Dylans shotgun.

&gt;And anyway, if a pack of 5 criminals is ready to pull their guns out if you pull yours, you'll better give them your damn wallet. 

Thats not how crimes and defense work. Stop speaking on matters you don't understand.

&gt;Doesn't matter how much have you practiced with your gun or how many bullets does your magazine have, risking your life for a damn wallet is not worth it.

Just because thats what they say what they want doesn't mean they will stop there. regardless they brought guns because they were willing to kill for my stuff, its worth killing them over the fact that they want to unjustly kill me.

&gt;Having a gun is only helpful if it's 1v1 or as a deterrent if you're protecting your own home.

No thats just plain false, just go to /r/dgu.

&gt;Otherwise you're basically betting your life that you're far better of a gunner than the 3 or 5 criminals attacking you combined.

Its not a movie, we don't all just meet in the street. Those five criminals can have thier approach controlled.

&gt;Terrorists and mass shooters would have it harder with 10 bullets and lots of recharging than huge magazines.

No they wouldn't see my VT example. Also in Paris and Germany guns are strictly controlled yet they had a mass shootings and massacres worse than ours.

&gt;Also it's harder to carry ten magazines of 10 bullets each than two magazines with 50 bullets each.

Still doesn't make any appreciable difference. The VT shooter had 10 rounders and shot his gun 190 times. He just brought a backpack. If anything carrying those would be easier than carrying non existent 50 rounders.

&gt; Also there's no way that if you're facing 3 criminals you can be certain that you'll be able to shoot all three of them before they shoot you. 

Actually I can, because it doesn't work like the wild west in some open street. You can take cover, move away. These people aren't accurate at all, guns aren't easy to use but they also aren't hard.

&gt;Even a 10% chance of failure would mean your death, while surrender means just losing your wallet. If it's 1v1 then it's fair, especially if you have practice, but 1v3 would take a Lucky Luke level of expertise.

Nobody expects a European to understand how defense works.

&gt;I wouldn't consider 17 to be high capacity necessarily. However letting someone have an automatic machinegun with 300 bullets is insane. Even with extensive background checks.

Where the fuck is that even a thing? Where the fuck do you get your info from? 

&gt;A 10 rounds one is about the same size as a 17 rounds one, so if you can only carry the 10 rounds ones then you'll be able to carry LESS in the same space. 

Still doesn't matter lots of people can die.

&gt; This means that a mass shooter wouldn't be able to have as much ammo as otherwise.

The obviously didn't stop the VT shooter. It only takes 30 shots to make the nightly news anyway.

&gt;Last time I checked the welfare vs taxes debate was going on strong.

That is a separate argument.

&gt; Also the country is still divided on abortion, religion and many other issues.

Social yes, but the government can't do anything, and religion is dying in America.

&gt;I have no idea why do you think that the only significant difference between liberals/democrats and conservatives/republicans is gun control!

I never said it was, just that people who are pro-gun are not going to vote for hillary on other issues.

&gt;Abortion is a HUGE debate, the south is very pro-life and the north is usually more pro-choice.

You don't know shit, this is just drummed up in the media. You are not from America, don't tell me whats important to me.

&gt; Immigration is basically one of the main appeals of Trump 

If people care about immigration, then they are voting for trump. Hillary literally only has status quo types, gun controllers, and feminists. My point stands, people aren't choosing guns over those other things because they already agree with trump on those things.

&gt;Feminism is about equality, 

Thats what they say but their actions show otherwise. Always judge by actions, not words.

&gt;If they suffer discrimination (actual discrimination not SJW bullshit) or want to let them decide what happens to their bodies you can't just ignore their concerns!

There is no discrimination against women in the west unless its positive. Feminist here want an easier time getting jobs they haven't earned, and free birth control.

&gt;import from China without paying a huge amount of arbitrary taxes, 

I would rather US manufacturing be protected.

&gt;I assume that in your experience you haven't met many liberals

I live in NJ. Most people in the US aren't liberal or conservative, they are actually libertarian. The problem with being libertarian is it naturally attracts the apathetic. People who are politically motivated generally are extremists in one direction or another here.

&gt;I understand that you put freedom first, what will lead to a prosperous society, just not as prosperous as it could be if sometimes freedom was second to quality of life.

Liberty is quality of life.

&gt;It's not an assumption, it's a fact. How you act on it is the difference between a cynical democrat or a genocidal dictator.

Its the same thing, peace requires weakness and apathy, it has nothing to do with the person wielding power.

&gt;Explain to me why most of Europe is gun-free yet their crime rates are so low.

They aren't gun free, and their crime was always low before their gun control. They have a very obedient and docile populace that also has a good standard of living due to the circumstances of having all of the economic power for the last 200 years.

&gt;If a gun ban didn't work, Europe would be doing horribly, but that's not the case.

You have it all wrong. Guns have nothing to do with the safety of a nation. That is purely due to economic conditions.

&gt;I'm just saying that a gun ban and low crime rates are perfectly compatible.

You assume we give a shit about society the way you do. I don't care about some soulless number with zero connection like a crime rate. I care about my liberty.

&gt;The US isn't all republicans, you can't just ignore the large amount of population which are more liberal minded. If you were right, Sanders and Al Gore wouldn't have made it past the door. Hillary would be like 20 points behind Trump, and potentially like 30 points behind any other republican. Obama wouldn't have been elected president either.

I never said it was, this isn't even relevant to the conversation. Most of the people who voted for Bernie just want free shit so they can be lazy.

&gt;Could you admit that america isn't populated exclusively by gun-loving, freedom-infatuated and women-indifferent republicans?

Revolutions may make sense when you're already starving and can't reasonably expect to life until the next year. Aside from that, a corrupt government is still better than a group of warlords fighting over power.

At the beginning you definitely needed to stay with your team more as you were a little late going into the point and when you got on the point your positioning was off and you got caught by the mei. I would have been standing at the door leading to the allies stairs and moving around there so I had an escape route and surrounded by tanks if i needed to get out.

0:50 - Don't go in without your team. If the enemy could aim you would have been dead and a re spawn timer would have awaited you

1:00 - Switch to passive healing! you are low and your allies are low and you are waiting to regroup. You didn't need to amp healing as you were all out of LOS of enemy and now you don't have a amp speed boost push for 12 seconds (wasting time)

1:40 - 9 times out of ten it's a good idea to speed boost out of a mei ult as it can easily get you out of the mei ult and to a safe place to heal

1:55 - It's a good idea to amp speed people like 76 and mcree when they are ulting as they can catch stragglers and people running away

2:30 - Unnecessary break it down. I know tire can be scary but don't break it down unless you are SURE it will kill and someone won't shoot it. Leaves you then open to the reaper Mei combo

2:40 - see 1:00 DON'T AMP UP HEALING THERE

3:30 - You got trapped not much you could have done there other than pray your team saves you. I would have probably died there as well. 

4:00 - AMP SPEED. IT IS LUCIO'S STRONGEST ABILITY! if you speed round the corner you could have not died to reaper. AND LOVE YOUR TANKS THEY WILL PROTECT YOU! run to them if you have no other escape, the reaper will probably lose interest if you run max speed into your team.

5:00 - You have a mic USE IT! tell your team left or right so you push as 6! better to push as 6 that 2/2/2 most of the time!

5:30 - READ THE BATTLE! sometimes you are in speed when you should be healing! also most of the time amping speed can get your allies to safety so they can be healed properly in a safe space for the healers.

5:50 - you front line a lot! you are a healer you should be in the back with line of sight of your allies. Behind the tanks and behind the dps.

6:30 - you can't boop a DVA while shooting and if by some miracle you do she will rocket boost so DON'T BE POINT BLANK AGAINST DVA!

7:50 - good taxi

I watched the rest of the video but it was alot of repeating the same mistakes I have already outlined.

TOP TIPS
Count stuff - Roadhog hook = 6secs
                   Junkrat has 5 bombs then reload
that sort of thing

Mei ult can't slow/stun if the robot dosn't have LOS of you

Lucio ult is a good counter ult! TRACK ENEMY ULTIES AND SAVE YOUR ULT e.g. reaper ult, mei ult, 76 ult. Lucio ult is also a good offensive ult as you can combo it with ally ults to protect them! e.g. 76 ult, genji ult

Don't walk into mei...

TL;DR - Sit further back, Speedboost more at the right time, have a plan B an escape. DON'T FRONTLINE. Love the tank. Make sure to use mic for flankers and planning. Don't go solo.

AFP Relax News•October 29, 2016

Taiwanese-born filmmaker Ang Lee predicted Friday that the Chinese film market was about to explode, not only overtaking but dwarfing the American box office in a matter of years.

The two-time Oscar winner said executives in the world's second economy used to rely on him as a bridge to Hollywood, but the newly-confident Chinese film industry no longer finds it necessary.

""It's huge, it's going to be bigger in a few years,"" the 62-year-old told reporters on the red carpet at the glitzy BAFTA Britannia Awards in Beverly Hills.

""In a few years it's probably going to be bigger (than the US) and then in the years to come a lot bigger. They've got many people and, most importantly, film has been lacking in the past in the culture, so it's still fresh.""

PricewaterhouseCoopers projects China's box office will rise from $4.3 billion in 2014 to $8.9 billion in 2019, outstripping the US.

Hollywood studios have been looking to capitalize on the burgeoning market through partnerships with Chinese companies.

Meanwhile, Beijing has ambitions to increase China's ""soft power,"" unleashing a wave of Chinese money into Hollywood.

Real estate developer turned media conglomerate Wanda bought ""Jurassic World"" creator Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion earlier this year. 

Last month Wanda -- which snapped up US movie theatre chain AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion -- announced it would invest in movies produced by Sony Pictures, its first deal with one of Hollywood's so-called ""Big Six"" studios. 

Lee was the first Asian ever to win an Oscar for directing, in 2006 for gay cowboy movie ""Brokeback Mountain."" He went on to win again for 2012's ""Life of Pi."" 

He was at the BAFTA LA ceremony -- which celebrates the contribution of Hollywood talent and British entertainers -- to receive the John Schlesinger Britannia Award for excellence in directing.

His war drama ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"" starring Joe Alwyn, Kristen Stewart, Vin Diesel and Steve Martin, is released in the US on November 11.

'Dangerous moment'

Americans Jodie Foster, 53, and Samuel L. Jackson, 67, were also honored at the gala in the luxury Beverly Hilton hotel while Tom Hanks, Jake Gyllenhaal, Brie Larson and Christopher Guest presented awards.

Among the Britons being recognized were Ewan McGregor, who starred in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy, and Felicity Jones, the lead in the upcoming spin-off, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.""

Three-time Golden Globe winner Ricky Gervais, 55, received the Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for excellence in comedy.

American actor Simon Helberg appeared to reference Britain's anti-EU ""Brexit"" vote and the US presidential election when he told AFP comedy in the two countries was becoming similar -- as was politics.

""I think the Brits seem to manage to be very intellectual and cerebral at times while masquerading as being very silly,"" said the 35-year-old, best known for US hit comedy ""The Big Bang Theory.""

""So there's this depth to it, but it can also work on a silly level. Sometimes I think Americans can lean very heavily into the silly, so you get a little less of the wit on occasion. 

""But you know what? It's all evening out. Our countries are both in a dangerous moment right now, so we'll see. The comedy and the political environment are all mirroring each other.""

Americans decide in their presidential polls on November 8 between Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has weathered controversy over her misuse of a private email server while Secretary of State, and Republican Donald Trump, whose rhetoric on women, Muslims and immigration has polarized the electorate.

Rank Choice votes eliminates this problem, allowing people to vote according to who represents their interest, as opposed to the current strategic vote for the ""lesser of two evils"".

Sanders supporters, Baraka explains, are basically just naïve shills.

“As much as the ‘Sandernistas ’ attempt to disarticulate Sanders ‘progressive’ domestic policies from his documented support for empire,” Baraka said. “It should be obvious that his campaign is an ideological prop – albeit from a center/left position – of the logic and interests of the capitalist-imperialist settler state.”

""The political reaction to the killing spree in Yemen that now eclipses the murderous assault on Gaza by Israel, has not only been met with indifference but many leftists and radicals in the U.S. have given their support to Bernie Sanders who said very clearly that under his administration the Saudi’s would be given even more latitude to carry out military operations in the Middle-East. The Sanders’ position is that the Saudi’s needed to get their “hands a little dirty.” For Bernie and his supporters, the mischief that the Saudi government and private individuals have been engaged in across the region financing groups like ISIS wasn’t dirty enough.

After years of drone attacks from the U.S., the end of the agony of the people of Yemen is nowhere in sight. These attacks targeted weddings, funerals, first responders to an initial drone attack and so-called signature strikes where an anonymous person is murdered because he fits the behavior profile of a “terrorist.” After pounding the country into rubble with six months of terror from the sky, the Saudi’s are now involved in ground operations in Yemen that will only increase the death toll and the humanitarian disaster.

This is the world that a President Sanders promises—continued war crimes from the sky with drone strikes and Saudi led terror in support of the Western imperial project.

This is not to suggest that everyone who might find a way to support Sanders is a closet racist and supporter of imperialism.""

It's the grind of the knife.  Scandi's are great with wood and some crisp vegetables.  But, you almost never see a knife marketed as a ""skinner"" knife with a Scandi grind, and that's because it's just not the task that grind was designed for.  What you might consider is getting an actual skinning knife, maybe something like the mini-Nessmuk from Jeff White.  Or the stockman style knife I mentioned if you're just skinning small game like squirrel or rabbit.  

If you're looking to replace the Enzo with a knife that skins well and can pass as a ""one tool option,"" then that narrows the selection down quite a bit.  I mentioned Jeff White knives, and that's definitely one option.  He's got a Nessmuk style knife that is right in that price range.  It's convex ground, skins like you wouldn't believe, does excellent food prep, and is very passable for woodwork.  It's not a Scandi, so don't expect it to notch and feather like the Trapper.  But it'll do it just fine and do those other tasks much easier.

Also, consider look at a flat grind.  Flat grind is the premier food prepping grind, and plenty of good skinners are sold with a flat grind.  There's a lot of options out there.  Problem is I'm not sure how many are available to you at a reasonable price.  I see you gave your budget in a foreign currency, so it's hard to make suggestions as an American since we hear a lot about knives being confiscated by customs in some European countries.

Brits often talk about this like it were a given. Brexiteers even make out like the EU is preventing us from having tighter commonwealth relations (which is partly because they often falsely believe that the UK couldn't handle more immigration as we're already bursting at the seams with Poles and Muslims getting free houses while Britons wait years, or because they falsely believe that  those damn ""unelected"" Brussels bureaucrats won't allow it). 

In reality, we don't have such a relationship with nations like Canada, Australia, and NZ because they don't particularly want to have such a relationship with us. Nor do I think the UK government is that keen to have such a relationship with them.

I'm not saying it could never happen. But arranging such a deal with be a huge amount of work, and each party would have to be confident that they would have net benefit overall from such a deal, which is obviously hard to convince them of. 

People don't seem to understand what opening labour markets between countries can do. Suddenly you might start losing key sectors to other nations. What would NZ do when half it's young people decide to up sticks and move somewhere else for most of their 20s (as they are already doing I'll add), because NZ can't offer the same diversity or excitement as major cities like Sydney, London, and Toronto? What happens when tonnes of highly skilled Australian and Canadian financial sectors up sticks and move to London because the job opportunities are greater? What about when the UK starts losing its north sea oil skill base to places like Edmonton and Calgary because there's simply more demand for their talents out there? 

The employer sponsored visa system works well help countries keep their talent and keep their competitive edge. It is designed ensure the government has a tight leash on who is and isn't allowed into the country, and that only those with needed skills are allowed in. Within the EU freedom of movement was possible because of the political union that tries to safeguard the economic interest of each member state, and puts money into poorer areas in an attempt to rebalance  wealth disparity between areas (see Cornwall, Wales etc).

This reminds me of an official EU document about common English mistakes made by EU officials in EU documents: http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf

Example:

&gt;**CONTROL (TO CONTROL, A CONTROL)**

&gt;**Explanation**

&gt;To control does not usually mean ‘to audit’ ‘check ’ or ‘verify’ ^(This  meaning  is  not  mentioned  at  all  in  the  Oxford  online  dictionary  and  is  described  by  Merriam 
Webster as “archaic” [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/control].) and ‘a control’ is not normally ‘a check’ or ‘an inspection’. Its most common meaning is ‘to exercise authoritative or dominating influence over; direct’. Thus, if we say that ‘the Commission controlled project X in the Member States’, we do not mean that the Commission audited it, but that the Commission ran  it.  In  combination  with  a  few  other  terms  contained  in  this  list,  this  misuse  can  end up  sounding  quite  sinister  (e.g. ‘the  Commission’s  contract  agents  were  on  a  mission  in the United Kingdom to control execution under Axis II’). Used as a noun, we do not ‘carry out’ or ‘perform’ controls. Controls are more likely to be systems that are in place (passport controls, for example). Hence, we can say that the Court checked to see if the key controls were  working,  but  not  that  it  carried  out  controls. When  talking  about  systems,  the  best term will often be ‘safeguard’. For example, ‘a number of safeguards are built into the system to ensure that funds are spent correctly’.  


&gt;**Examples**

&gt;‘Administrative checks must be under taken on all applications for support and payment claims, 
and cover all elements that are possible and appropriate to *control* by administrative means.’ 
‘Apart from the annual review of the reference amount, customs authorities are not obliged to 
carry out *controls* after authorisation.’

&gt;**Alternatives**

False.

Mercury emissions from coal consumption are a major threat for food production, primarily fisheries. Unlike radiation releases from Chernobyl, these are actively harming people.

&gt;Water safety: Storing nuclear waste might be a problem for water supply

Coal sludge/ chemical waste from solar/wind turbine production.

&gt;Catastrophes: Individual accidents can be dealt with more easily than with catastrophes. There is no such thing as a solar catastrophe.

Individual catastrophes are harder to shove under the carpet. People normalize a small constant rate of tragedy, even if it causes more deaths than a small tragedy.

This is a flaw in human reasoning, not behaviour that needs to be encouraged.

&gt;Evacuations

&gt;Safety of land: In the case of a nuclear disaster the land is practically lost for centuries and longer timespans.

If we were to put the same safety standards on evacuation for nuclear reasons on fossil fuel powered production, then most of Europe would need to be evacuated. You're using fear for a technology as an argument to fear it, which is circular.

That said, Fukushima is being cleaned up far faster than centuries. Most of the area has already been cleaned up or will be released within a year.

&gt;Illness: You might not die from cancer (we gladly are getting much better at treating it), but it still very much sucks.

Other energy technologies cause illnesses as well.

Greenpeace commits a major statistical fallacy here.

They assume because there was 1 Chernobyl sized accident in the last 30 years, that the risk on chernobyl sized accidents is equal to 1 per 30 years. That's similar to me flipping a coin, and proclaiming that the odds for heads are 100%.

It works pretty well.

Uma coisa que tenho a apontar nos teus vídeos é a maneira como tu falas ou dizes as coisas. Como já foi referido, nem sempre dizes as coisas com clareza (possivelmente dada a dicção) e pareces falar de uma maneira um pouco fechada. Isso torna um pouco mais complicado acompanhar-te. Quanto a isso, aconselho a que vejas os vídeos do canal que referi, em que o narrador apresenta tudo de uma maneira bastante atractiva no que toca à fala.

Outra coisa que me atrai no dito canal é a espécie de entusiasmo que o narrador apresenta ao falar. Não digo que devas apresentar os jogos como se estivesses a comentar um jogo de futebol (ainda que isso pudesse ser interessante na tua análise ao Fifa), mas não de maneira tão monótona. 

Quanto ao texto, tenho a apontar que te repetes um pouco. Isso notou-se bastante na análise do FIFA. Também achei que te contradisseste um pouco na análise do RotTR, mas isto já sou eu a ser picuinhas. 

Evita dizer ""(...) o jogo merece **claramente** a nota X"". Não me soa nada bem.

Uma coisa que achei intrusiva foi o símbolo do canal nos vídeos. Muito grande e acaba por tapar sempre elementos dos jogos. Se calhar podias minimizar isso ou fazer uma moldura que não fosse tão intrusiva. Fora isso, os vídeos têm boa qualidade no que toca à imagem e produção.

Outra coisa que podias fazer era, quiçá, passar as tuas reviews para formato de texto e colocares como link na descrição do vídeo. Ah, e se calhar também colocar links para sites nacionais que vendam os jogos a um preço acessível.

Rektor har hovedfokus på at utvekslingsstudenter bør være sikret bolig, no jeg er helt enig i. Utvekslingsstudenter blir boende stort sett et semester, noen to, og svært få fire. At de blir prioritert i en søknadsprosess er ikke mer urettferdig en om de skulle søke en bolig i et land de ikke bor og der de ikke kjenner noen, når de ikke får vite hvor de skal på utveksling før noen måneder før de skal dra, på lik linje med de som har bodd i landet et helt liv.

Til slutt er jeg og enig med rektor at man må bygge flere studentboliger, men man bør kanskje innse at alle ikke trenger eget kjøkken og bad med fliser og varmekabler, slik at en hel boligblokk resulterer i like mange soveplasser som en vanlig europeisk reisehospits, men at tilbud om en plass med en pult og en seng er tilstrekkelig for veldig mange.

Você está dizendo que o ENEM é ruim para as crianças pobres? Não entendi direito.

Eu também sofri bullying (e um dia eu também compartilho contigo as coisas que me fazem lembrar disso) mas não vejo os ocupantes como uma panelinha. A proporção de alunos que apoiam as ocupações e de alunos que querem a volta das aulas varia de escola pra escola. Bullying é o que o MBL está fazendo na porta das escolas ocupadas, marmanjos fortões e mal intencionados ridicularizando gente que não é do tamanho deles. As escolas estão abertas para os alunos das próprias escolas votarem o fim das ocupações (como já ocorreu em muitas escolas).

As ocupações causam transtorno, pra dizer o mínimo. É muito raro uma movimentação que não causa transtorno conseguir pressionar. Pelo desespero do governo, não dá pra dizer que as ocupações não estão colaborando pra lutar contra a MP. Nisso eu sei que a gente discorda, mas na minha opinião e na dos ocupantes, a MP será danosa para gerações após gerações de estudantes. A passividade é danosa para todas as gerações do Brasil. Eu acho que teria sido mais danoso e mais anti-ético não se ocupar, mesmo com todos os malefícios que as ocupações também trazem. É por isso, também, que não vejo as ocupações como panelinhas. Até onde eu saiba, absolutamente todas começaram com assembléias onde a proposta de ocupar ganhou. Não foi vista pelos ocupantes como uma protesto ""deles"" usando a escola. Foi vista por eles como um protesto da própria comunidade escolar, dos estudantes como um todo, das próprias pessoas que não tem nada além de uma escola, contra ataques feitos a essa comunidade. Eu acho que é uma maioria, você pode achar que é uma minoria, mas com certeza em muitas das escolas ocupadas são estudantes em conjunto defendendo seus direitos.

Economic terms also fall to geopolitics. Don't tell me Marshall Plan was just an economic policy.

&gt; The challenge with Europe is that the EU doesn't really help with the United States interests, but it doesn't hurt them either. NATO provides the security the United States desires, so the economic integration the EU causes isn't really making Europe more safe from an American perspective.

Supporting the UK means antagonising the EU, in any kind of intervention during Brexit negotiations. There's no way around this statement, mate. You are ignoring the basic fact that an unfriendly EU means that the US is risking itself on indefinitely getting kicked out of most of Eurasia. The US have already antagonised China, butting heads with Russia, and you want the give the Europeans a reason to be pissed as well? How's that for security policy?

&gt; In terms of value, the UK is easily the most valuable country from a security perspective. Germany has a strong anti-war sentiment that has the country pursue economic and diplomatic solutions to problems, but that makes it extremely difficult for them to reach a decision to use military force. This isn't a bad thing for a country to be, but it makes it much harder to work with the United States who is more willing to use force sooner. France has a desire to not tie themselves to closely with anyone and really only cares about the French speaking world. Pretty much every other country in the EU use their military for defensive reasons.

Sorry but this part is incredibly one-dimensional and without thought. The US have been Europe's main defender during the Cold War and beyond. Good point that they are not that useful in security perspective, but the US is also Japan's main army. Should the US abandon Japan because of their pacifistic constitution? The question I gave is ridiculous to be even discuss.

the strategic usefulness of the EU is grand strategy. The EU, collectively, has the 2nd(?) largest GDP in the world. It occupied most of the European continent. it is also the US's western anchor in the Eurasian super-continent. The UK has a vast network of islands and bases, but then so does France.

&gt; What sets the UK apart is that their military is more expeditionary. They are better suited to be deployed around the world, and *the UK is more willing to send them around the world. Their willingness to fight and the common language with the United States makes them an easy fit into American formations and vis versa*. 

There is little history to support this. Unless you're so short-sighted that you can't see beyond 2001. Both France and the UK have little wartime collaboration with the US during the Cold War.

&gt; The UK has already proven to be the United States most steadfast ally in Europe, so there is a desire to keep the relationship going.

So steadfast that the Syria proposal was shot down by the parliament. France, on the other hand, was disturbingly eager to go to Syria. 

If anything, Britain's lack of geopolitical options is a good reason on why the US shouldn't intervene in the first place. For the sake of argument, if the US does intervene to the side of the EU (for whatever reason), what would the UK do? Break ties? Court Russia? Nothing. They will suck it up. Thus, the US has nothing to gain by intervening on the side of an ally that is already super friendly, and it risk losing a lot (if not all) of its influence in the European continent if it does intervene. US foreign policy shouldn't be about Anglo-Saxon sentiment. It's what the US can gain the most if it took this or that decision.

&gt; My observation on the matter is that the EU is in a better position in the negotiations because it is the larger power. If they chose to be spiteful, then their economic loss would be less than Britain's. If they chose to be magnanimous, then I see Europe continuing on as it has been. **I see the United States intervening only if they feel that the UK is being threatened with economic destruction.**

A good reason on why the US will be concerned. However, this is highly unlikely considering that the biggest victims of a British economic implosion will be the UK, followed by the EU.

Eu pessoalmente sou ateu e não vejo as coisas da mesma forma que ele, mas consigo entender a lógica.

2. ""Correção física"" é um tema extremamente polêmico. Minha filosofia é a seguinte: 
&gt; Podem haver momentos em que um pai DEVE bater em seu filho, pois ele já errou em algum momento durante a educação da criança. O pai deve manter isso em mente e ter peso na consciência ao fazer isso, saber que sua falha está causando sofrimento a criança naquele momento e se esforçar pra não falhar de novo. Talvez se os pais sejam extremamente bem preparados eles não falhem na criação dos seus filhos e não seja necessária a correção física, mas essa não é a realidade da maioria esmagadora dos casais, sinceramente.

Posso estar errado pela minha posição em relação a isso, mas não acho que quem acredita em correção física deve sofrer linchamento moral desta forma.

&gt; &amp;quot;We do not know what prompted Moscow authorities to prevent our staff from accessing our offices - an unwelcome surprise for which we received no prior warning,&amp;quot; said Amnesty International&amp;#039;s Europe Director John Dalhuisen.

&gt; The group rents its office directly from municipal authorities and has been a tenant there for more than 20 years, Amnesty International spokesman Conor Fortune told CNN. The Moscow office was searched in 2013, but this is the first time staff have been unable to access it, he said.

Not finding certain features of someone to be attractive is fine, but if you reject them automatically based on that one thing, that is what is racist. 

When you say ""no blacks"" on your profile and get nasty or annoyed when black people deign to talk to you, that's racist. Because when you do that, you are saying that there is absolutely nothing about black people that you could ever find attractive.

When you say you ""aren't into black people"" you are buying into a cultural socialization that says that black people's natural features are ""unattractive"" and undesired. You are buying into centuries of propaganda saying that black people are not as valuable. You're validating outdated ideals of beauty and attraction that rewards european features and punishes african and south america features.

You do not do it on purpose. It is not necessarily an overt racism. It is part of systemic racism though.

Started the season with the same 4-2-3-1 that we played last year and that was working all right I guess until we got dominated by Liverpool and Arsenal. Once Conte changed to the 3-4-3 we look like a completely different team. At the beginning of the season I would've been over the moon to be back in the Champions League, but after our last 4 results I see no reason why we can't challenge for the title. We seem to have all of the necessary parts:

* A very solid defense (0 goals conceded in last 4 games) 
* Excellent depth (probably the best we've had in 5 years) 
* A star striker 
* A happy Eden Hazard

When Chelsea have really played at our best over the last few years, it's been our defense that has made the difference (2012 Champions League run, 2015 Premier League title). David Luiz has walked into our starting XI and looks to be a massive signing for us, making our defense and midfield look almost impenetrable at times.

&gt; The New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined the Trump Plaza $450,000 after finding that the hotel gave LiButti $1.6 million worth of luxury autos, including Ferraris, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces, that he then exchanged for cash — a violation of state laws at the time that barred cash “comps” for high rollers. (Among other gifts the Trump casino gave LiButti: paying $104,338 for five European vacations and one to California; $279,978 for tickets to the Super Bowl, boxing matches and other sporting and theater events; $121,712 for jewelry; and $40,020 for champagne that included 178 bottles of Cristal Rosé, valued at $225 a bottle.)

One would think one might remember a man one gave a couple million dollars to, and who sparked a $200K finding in a discrimination case based on how one handled him --

&gt; [LiButti]also made it clear “he did not want women, blacks or other minorities dealing or supervising his games,” according to one filing by the state division of gaming enforcement. He referred to one Trump Plaza floor person as a “dumb c***” and “dumb bitch, ” another as a “Jew broad” and an African-American dealer as a “black bastard.”
&gt; 
&gt; State officials argued that, rather than removing some of its employees from LiButti’s crap tables, the hotel should have removed LiButti from the casino. But it didn’t, the officials contended, because he was such a valuable customer.

Again, why lie about it?

No, definitely not.

Trump believes climate change is a hoax, wants to back out of the Paris climate agreement, remove environmental regulations and increase coal production. We should have started taking massive action 20 years ago against climate change, we can't afford to wait 4-8 years or worse, go 20 years backwards due Trump repealing and blocking any and all environmental laws.

Trump has suggested freezing all new legislation, and only allowing 1 law to be added for every 2 laws repealed.

Trump has suggested removing the Wall Street regulations put in place after the 2007 financial crash.

Trump wants to reduce taxes for the 1%, including abolishing death tax and lowering capital gains tax.

Trump wants to gut the first amendment by opening up libel laws so that he can more easily sue newspapers, thus watering down freedom of the press.

Trump wants more government surveillance and censorship of the internet to ""fight ISIS recruitment"".

Trump said in relation to terrorists that he wants to ""take out their families"".

Trump wants to bring back waterboarding and other worse methods of torture.

Trump said he would be OK with jailing American citizens in Gitmo and trying them in military tribunals.

Trump's economic plan would have him declare trade wars against Europe, Japan, China, Mexico and other countries.

Trump's tax plan will leave a huge gaping hole in the federal budget that will increase the national debt by $5-7 trillion, for Hillary the increase would be $200-300 billion during her term (record low deficit).

Trump has suggested leaving NATO if European countries don't meet his demands, and even if they do, he has said the US might not help them incase of Russian aggression.

Trump supports nuclear proliferation, he said in an interview that he was even OK with Saudi Arabia acquiring nuclear weapons.

Trump has said he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea and drop sanctions against Russia.

IMF austerity and TTIP-type corporatocracy etc is as bad as war in the way it squeezes out the ability to make a living for the average Jo in some 3rd world nation as one would squeeze water from a sponge that already operates so close to the margins, sending the wealth flowing back to the Western based HQs of the 1 percent (thus the people try to follow the money, just as the saying goes).

That's misleading. It's not about Russians as ethnicity, but only about Soviet migrants (that didn't speak local languages) who did not get citizenship automatically. They formed the majority of Russians, though, true.

I've argumented this decision of Estonia a lot, and I admit it was not 100% fair towards everyone. But I've always insisted there was no option that would be 100% fair. Having a huge part of your citizens not being able to speak the official language (and not being able to communicate with the majority) was considered to be a worse option back then.

&gt; None of that happened in Baltic states. Baltic people were civilized enough to not start massacre your former occupants, your hated russian minority (let's say clear, in nineties 95% of estonians hated them and wanted them to leave).

I don't think there was hate as much as there was ignorance. Many in the Baltics believed Russians would just leave after the collapse of Soviet Union, and therefore didn't even think of their situation. Only in time would they realize there's a huge portion of people unintegrated and not planning to go anywhere.

&gt; And that's why I know that estonian nation is smart, european and civilized even though many people there don't like russian minority and russians in general.

I'd like to add here that attitude towards Russians and Russia is heavily dependent on politics (Western views are heavily preferred), history (especially on one's position about occupation of Baltics). Attitudes like ""Russia's always been an enemy, hurr durr those uncivilized barbarians..."" is some close-minded nationalist thinking and not okay in mainstream.

How many can we integrate? What would be an objective way to determine that number?

The biggest stumbling block is that most of the right insists we not have that conversation and just set the number to zero. That is literally zero - Poland refuses to take in a single refugee, with many eastern european countries agreeing with them. Even the USA's republicans do not want to take in a single one. This is a shame because the refugee crisis is not and should not be a European crisis. It is the a problem for the whole modern world to solve.

Instead of resorting to cheap populism, it is the responsibility of the right to agree on a sensible and fair number of refugees to accept. There is no alternative. Talking about Europe's christian heritage and whatnot might be great but it won't make the refugees disappear.

But, as I've said many times, jointly agreeing on a way to handle the refugees is extremely unprofitable, politically speaking.

Even if one peak performance was to match the names I've mentioned, his average could be way below that and that is all that matters. I think I've seen every single minute of competitive Mei he has played (actually probably saw every single minute of competitive play in general of him) and I find it incredibly hard to gather a data set that would be able to convince you or rather that you'd be willing to invest over our argument. The lack of stats to at least support ones argument strikes again.

Moreover I am unsure how valuable the knowledge of one being the best player on a specific character is unless you are so good (ie. Shadowburn) to make things work where others can't. Otherwise diversity is king hence why TviQ is the most valuable player in the world. I made the point though, that Seagull isn't among the best Meis and I will try my best to defend that point.

 Here is some arguments for my picks: 

Nevix almost single handely won them E-League. He was MVP of the tournament. Many people (for example flame) were praising Nevix Mei to be the best in Europe. I'd specifically look at the series against Rogue and especially Hollywood. 

While Talespin currently is having a hard time adjusting to the meta for reasons very similar to Seagull his strongest pick in this meta is arguably Mei. Lately Talespin was able to hold his own against Lunatic Hai. Look at Anubis and Dorado that series. His ult usage (timing and execution) is incredibly efficient often outplaying EscA. The one time EscA gets him Dorado is decided by it though.

EscA just has insane hit accuracy on Mei. His ult build up on her is the best in the world. If Lunatic Hai could build more around the ult advantages he gets over opponent Mei's they could win a ton more team fights. Their estimation of enemy ults is not quite there yet though.

Surefour just has much more impressive mechanics and gets more done. If we assume that the series you refered to was Seagull's top performance, well Surefour has been doing that (also on Mei) for a couple of month. 

It needs to be said that the VoD you linked isn't particularly impressive and pretty textbook Mei play (which makes the cast a little annoying to listen to, heh). Often you think he did well but when thinking it over you realize that his team did most of the work there. Take the push they do on Nubani offense where EscA is upper and Deadeye's. Seagull almost kills his entire team by being unable to hit a headshot on an almost stationary target and the only reason EscA doesn't get a multikill there is that Pookz ulted reactively to the Deadeye. Seagull almost whiffs it and has to kill him with body shots. If EscA gets a heal he survives and they lose the fight. 
I don't want to overanalyze. You'd be able to find these even in the best Mei at the moment I'm sure. I actually got a bigger appreciation for his wall usage rewatching that VoD, so thanks for that! I think comparing his Mei to Talespin became increasingly more fair. I still think EscA, TviQ and Nevix are above the rest and all three of those players have absolutely insane skill transition and could play every single role on a top team if they wanted to. If Seagull had an EscA-esque (heh) McCree, I would be a lot less harsh on him. If Seagull had even just a single character he plays on the level of TviQ I would be super hyped. Seagull might have the talent, but having stream blocks before scrimms might be enough to make his practice inefficient. You obviously can't blame the guy for doing it like he currently does. He's making mad bank. 

I close in hoping that we get stats soon so we both wouldn't have to discuss on the level we are forced to right now. I'm reasonably sure Seagull's icicle accuracy is much below the others I've mentioned but I have no way of proving it. He does have pretty great wall usage though.

Accomodation cost is 650eur in major West German cities add transportation,food then multiply that by 2 and add deposit usually in value of one monthly rent.First wage will be paid next month so one needs to survive for 2 months on savings and some extra money if something would go wrong.Cost can be reduced if one has a friend or relative that will help there on place.If jobseeking will fail amount of spend money is also much lower(or try will even be possible).Sometimes company or work agency can assure accomodation as well as pre-arranged job

Admittedly it sounds very extreme, but there is at least one close analogue: boxing. Two boxers agree to indemnify the other against charges of assault and battery.

Similarly, someone with a rule that allows for assisted-suicide is essentially allowing killing a human being--with a reasonable purpose, if not actual murder.

Now, my stance is that it's not impossible that two people might agree to engage in a fight to the death. In fact, Japan had such a culture not long ago--the practice was only banned during the US occupation of Japan, but in the decades up to that, famous martial artists regularly engaged in duels to prove their prowess to others, or to settle a dispute between them. Look up [Toshitsugu Takamatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshitsugu_Takamatsu) who was engaged in over a dozen duels to the death shortly before they were outlawed in this time period.

There was a similar culture in Europe and the early USA only a few hundred years ago, and our own Hamilton was shot by Aaron Burr in one of these. This was akin to legal murder. I would have no real objection to duels of this sort re-emerging as an alternative to the kinds of murder we get these days from those who so gravely hurt others yet under the law have no legal avenue to seek revenge. Maybe we're good at walking away when you find your wife in bed with someone, but maybe that's too much for a lot of people, and dueling would be an alternative to murder in that case.

But in general, no one's going to have a 'murder is allowed generally' rule here, since it's quite simply a dumb rule.

For a long time, left was the rule. in the middle ages, horse riders would ride on the left side because most people are right-handed...you could meet someone coming at you with a weapon in your dominant hand.

America caused the flip to the right in the 18th century. In those days, one teamster would drive a whole team of horses pulling a heavy wagon. He would typically sit on the back left horse, so he could use his right (dominant) hand with a lash to easily prod the horses on.
